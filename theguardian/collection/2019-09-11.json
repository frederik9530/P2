The administration announced in July a new policy that would deny asylum to anyone who passes through another country on their way to the US without seeking protection there first, therefore affecting almost all migrants who arrive at the US-Mexico border. The justices\u2019 order late Wednesday temporarily undoes a lower-court ruling that had blocked the new asylum policy in some states along the southern border.

      "body": "<p>A surge in shop closures and the growth of automated retail are forcing tens of thousands of women out of work, according to a study of the economic pain caused by high street decline.</p> <p>With twice as much UK shopping now online than in 2011 and amid a wave of store closures, about 75,000 jobs as sales assistants or checkout operators previously taken by women have gone in the last seven years. Men lost 33,000 of the jobs over the period 2011 to 2018, but these were offset by increases in roles in warehouses and as delivery drivers which are largely taken by men, according to research by the Royal Society For the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce.</p> <p>The accelerating switch to e-commerce means entry-level shop floor jobs for teenage girls and part-time shop work for older women juggling caring commitments are evaporating.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-women-working-in-retail\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-women-working-in-retail&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-women-working-in-retail&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt is women who are on the front line of this,\u201d said Rowan Conway, RSA director of innovation. \u201cThe traditional female skills of caring, welcoming and being customer service driven are lost when you are behind the wall of a logistics company or an Amazon warehouse.\u201d</p> <p>Conway added that the way performance in warehouse and delivery jobs is measured still tends to focus on hitting deadlines rather than customer service and is \u201cvery blokey\u201d.</p> <p>It is part of a long-term trend which has seen the share of female employee jobs in retail fall from 16% in 1996 to 11% in 2018. Over that period around 270,000 jobs occupied by women were lost, according to figures produced by the Resolution Foundation.</p> <p>\u201cThe government has tied itself in knots to respond to charges that technology is decimating men\u2019s jobs,\u201d said Sophie Walker, chief executive of the Young Women\u2019s Trust which supports under-30s, especially those living on little or no pay. \u201cIts response to this latest assessment is pitiful in comparison to the millions set aside to prevent closures of car factories and other male-dominated industries.\u201d</p> <p>The warning of the gender-specific impact of high street upheaval comes as separate data this week revealed shop, pub and restaurant closures are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/11/retailers-call-for-action-as-high-street-store-closures-soar\">rising at the fastest rate in nearly a decade</a>.

      "bodyText": "A surge in shop closures and the growth of automated retail are forcing tens of thousands of women out of work, according to a study of the economic pain caused by high street decline. With twice as much UK shopping now online than in 2011 and amid a wave of store closures, about 75,000 jobs as sales assistants or checkout operators previously taken by women have gone in the last seven years. Men lost 33,000 of the jobs over the period 2011 to 2018, but these were offset by increases in roles in warehouses and as delivery drivers which are largely taken by men, according to research by the Royal Society For the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce. The accelerating switch to e-commerce means entry-level shop floor jobs for teenage girls and part-time shop work for older women juggling caring commitments are evaporating. \u201cIt is women who are on the front line of this,\u201d said Rowan Conway, RSA director of innovation. \u201cThe traditional female skills of caring, welcoming and being customer service driven are lost when you are behind the wall of a logistics company or an Amazon warehouse.\u201d Conway added that the way performance in warehouse and delivery jobs is measured still tends to focus on hitting deadlines rather than customer service and is \u201cvery blokey\u201d. It is part of a long-term trend which has seen the share of female employee jobs in retail fall from 16% in 1996 to 11% in 2018. Over that period around 270,000 jobs occupied by women were lost, according to figures produced by the Resolution Foundation. \u201cThe government has tied itself in knots to respond to charges that technology is decimating men\u2019s jobs,\u201d said Sophie Walker, chief executive of the Young Women\u2019s Trust which supports under-30s, especially those living on little or no pay. \u201cIts response to this latest assessment is pitiful in comparison to the millions set aside to prevent closures of car factories and other male-dominated industries.\u201d The warning of the gender-specific impact of high street upheaval comes as separate data this week revealed shop, pub and restaurant closures are rising at the fastest rate in nearly a decade. In the past two years Debenhams and House of Fraser were among the retailers to go into administration while Arcadia, which owns Topshop, and New Look are among those closing stores. A fifth of UK retail spending is now carried out online and with this predicted to double in the coming years. The biggest job losses in sales and customer service occupations came in the East Midlands, the North East and in the East of England. Meanwhile, there was a 16% increase in the number of retail jobs in London between 2011 and 2018, the RSA found. \u201cThe economic pain that comes with the decline of the high street is not being felt evenly,\u201d said Fabian Wallace-Stephens, one of the report\u2019s authors. \u201cAs ever more people are shopping online, and businesses are introducing automated technology like self-service checkouts, this is changing the types of jobs available. Women are being hit particularly hard, with jobs growth being contained to roles usually filled by men such as delivery drivers.\u201d In the longer term, those warehouse jobs also appear under threat. Food retailers, Ocado and Adsa, already operate fully automated warehouses, which in Ocado\u2019s case picks goods at the rate of one every six seconds. One of Ocado\u2019s automated warehouses was hit by a major blaze in February when a grocery-carrying robot caught fire. Tesco, John Lewis, River Island and Ted Baker were among retailers who collaborated with the RSA to try to predict the future of shop work. \u201cIn-store influencer\u201d was one of the new roles mooted for workers in high street stores. Another was \u201cline manager for robots\u201d. The RSA described an influencer\u2019s role as building a brand\u2019s relationship with customers directly, rather than lower-skilled work such as stock control or checkouts. In supermarkets this might require shop floor workers to gain skills in cooking and nutrition so that they can host cooking classes, or advise customers about diets and recipes using new ingredients. One retailer told the study: \u201cEmpathy is already becoming a business need.\u201d Another said \u201cstaff will have to be much more credible, otherwise people will just shop online\u201d. All this will improve job satisfaction, retailers predicted, because workers \u201cwill add value by making people feel good about themselves\u201d.",

An initial \u00a313bn of private sector-funded investment in new hospitals will end up costing the NHS in England a staggering \u00a380bn by the time all contracts come to an end, the IPPR thinktank has found. Some trusts are having to spend as much as one-sixth of their entire budget on repaying debts due as a result of the PFI scheme. PFI was introduced by John Major\u2019s Conservative government but its use proliferated in the Blair era . The findings raised concerns that the diversion of such large sums at a time when many trusts are in the red and coping with the fast-rising demand for care. There are fears it could damage the quality of care and risk patient safety because trusts do not have funds to hire enough staff. \u201cToxic PFI contracts are still driving billions away from patients and into private bank accounts,\u201d said Chris Thomas, an IPPR health fellow, who carried out the research. The PFI contract for Barts Health trust in London, involving an outlay of almost \u00a31.2bn, is the largest by value in the English NHS. It paid for the building of the Royal London hospital, which opened in 2012 and has 845 beds spread across 110 wards. However, the entire project will have cost the trust \u00a36.2bn by the time it ends, according to Treasury estimates.

Ministers have banned the NHS from using PFI for any future building projects after criticism that many of the contracts still active represent poor value for money. The IPPR is urging the government to legislate to let trusts buy out such contracts and bring them into public ownership and boost the NHS\u2019s capital budget by \u00a35.5bn so it can afford to undertake projects without PFI.

      "bodyText": "Australia is facing a shortage of medicine vital for cancer diagnoses due to a mechanical fault at the Lucas Heights nuclear medicine facility. Less than three months after production was suspended at the new Australian nuclear medicine facility when two workers were exposed to an unsafe dose of radiation, the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation has confirmed another shutdown occurred on Friday. While Ansto insists there are \u201cno safety implications\u201d from the failure, a shortfall in production of the radioisotope molybdenum-99 or Mo-99 could have severe implications. Ansto admitted Australia was experiencing \u201csignificant impacts on availability of nuclear medicine\u201d, and doctors have told Guardian Australia that unless production resumes they will be forced to \u201cplay Pontius Pilate\u201d with their patients\u2019 health. \u201cThis will be a crisis by next week,\u201d the director of Kalgoorlie Medical Imaging in Western Australia, Peter Tually, said. \u201cI\u2019m going to be presented with six or seven referrals and I\u2019m going to have to make a decision about who I can see and who I can\u2019t.\u201d The $168m nuclear medicine facility at Lucas Heights, south of Sydney, was announced by the federal government in 2012 with the goal of tripling Australian production of Mo-99, the parent isotope of Technetium-99m. The isotope is used to diagnose a variety of heart, lung, organ and musculoskeletal conditions, as well as cancers. Ansto said the supply of medicine made before Friday\u2019s incident has been distributed to hospitals and nuclear medicine clinics, and it was working to \u201cunderstand the cause of the mechanical defect, and safely rectify the issue\u201d. On Thursday, Ansto said it had secured a limited supply of MO-99 and would be able to supply it from next week. \u201cWe expect that the amounts from overseas will gradually increase over the next three weeks, starting with 10 per cent of normal supply from next week and working up to around a third of normal supply by early next month,\u201d Ansto said. \u201cBoth investigations and work are continuing to safely progress mechanical repairs within ANSTO\u2019s ANM facility.\u201d Tually, who has been critical of the handling of medicine shortages, said the medical industry was \u201cagain reeling\u201d as a result of the shutdown. \u201cMy job now is to determine which patient gets a test and which one has to miss out [and] they are not easy phone calls to make,\u201d he said. In June last year production was halted after another mechanical fault. On previous occasions Australia has sourced the product from South Africa or the United States. The Ansto spokesman said the organisation was exploring the possibility of importing bulk medicine while repairs were undertaken. \u201cManufacturing will resume after the fault is safely and properly rectified,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will keep the regulator and nuclear medicine community informed as we work to rectify this issue.\u201d He said \u201cfurther rectification works will be carried out in a safe way that minimises health risk\u201d, after approval from the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency. Lucas Heights is only one of 11 reactors around the world that produces nuclear isotopes for medical imaging and treatment. As well as providing about 85% of the nuclear medicine products used in Australian hospitals, it produces thousand more doses of Mo-99 for international patients.",

There are lauded authors, such as Philip Roth, James Joyce and Virginia Woolf, whose books haven\u2019t survived the journey quite so well, time and time again, yet Perrotta has a flawless, if limited, track record. His stinging high school satire Election became one of 1999\u2019s most acclaimed films before the darkly comic suburban drama Little Children brought one of Kate Winslet\u2019s best performances to date and most recently, HBO\u2019s ambitious three-season extension of The Leftovers was met with a rapturous reception.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/11/greed-review-steve-coogan-michael-winterbottom\">Greed review \u2013 Steve Coogan gleams in knockabout satire of the mega-rich</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He\u2019s sticking with the channel for a new limited series based on his most recent, and arguably best, novel, Mrs Fletcher, a hugely engrossing and deftly structured book about a woman and her son dealing with sex in very different ways. Eve (Kathryn Hahn) is preparing herself for a change and it\u2019s one that she isn\u2019t happy with or ready for, the result of her son leaving home for college. Brendan (Jackson White) is ready to leave, ready for his life as a popular and desirable high school jock to continue in a different, less restrained, location. Like the book, the show follows them both as they make their way through exciting and dangerous new phases.</p> <p>The success of Perrotta\u2019s big and small screen incarnations has a great deal to do with Perrotta himself, the author deciding to take a key role in each adaptation post-Election. Mrs Fletcher is no different, with him credited as creator and executive producer, but it\u2019s also in large part to the writers and directors he\u2019s chosen to collaborate with. In this instance, there\u2019s something so cosmically perfect about Perrotta teaming up with the writer-director Nicole Holofcener, the two sharing a great deal in common, both sharp and empathetic in how they capture everyday life without pulling punches. Holofcener has long been one of the greatest yet most underrated talents in Hollywood, from Friends with Money to Enough Said to her Oscar-nominated screenplay for last year\u2019s Can You Ever Forgive Me? For anyone familiar with her or Perrotta\u2019s work, it\u2019s a thrilling match-up. Mrs Fletcher brings out the best of them both, a funny, often daring, and never less than entirely believable series about how to navigate sex in the current moment.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25EnTkB71LA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/25EnTkB71LA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>As the two are separated, Eve finds unlikely solace online in the world of Milf porn, quickly becoming addicted while college shows Brendan that his aggressively reductive view of women as sexual objects has no place in the real world. A lazier show would treat all of this with a far heavier hand but there\u2019s remarkably light-footed patience, intelligence and a total lack of judgment in Mrs Fletcher and while it might skate close to sitcom-esque scenarios, it never opts for cheap humour. It also manages to address woke culture in way that feels balanced and thoughtful, ridiculing some of the excesses (such as a well-intentioned yet misjudged college lecture on consent) while allowing characters the space to make and then realise the effects of their mistakes (a trans character is asked a crude question in one scene only to be met with a sheepish yet earnest apology a few scenes later).</p> <p>As perfect as Holofcener\u2019s direction might be for Perrotta\u2019s writing, Hahn is equally well-suited to them both. Her finest work has always existed in similar territory, most notably her role as a bored wife befriending a stripper in Jill Soloway\u2019s cruelly underseen 2013 comedy Afternoon Delight. She\u2019s long deserved a show of her own and Mrs Fletcher provides her with a fitting showcase, zipping between funny, sexy, awkward and self-righteous, a wonderful opportunity to see her explore a character for longer than 90 minutes. The show\u2019s pace is gradual, moments are allowed to breathe despite episodes lasting for just 30 minutes and cliffhangers are replaced with opportunities for us to think and discuss, the format never once cheapening Perrotta\u2019s wonderfully naturalistic storytelling.</p> <p>In the three episodes available, Mrs Fletcher promises to become something rather special, an acutely observed show that quietly covers a great deal without ever feeling overstuffed or sententious. And in the subgenre of Tom Perrotta adaptations, the streak remains unbroken.</p> <ul> <li><p>Mrs Fletcher is showing at the Toronto film festival and will begin on HBO in the US on 27 October and in the UK on Sky Atlantic later this year</p></li> </ul>",

Brendan (Jackson White) is ready to leave, ready for his life as a popular and desirable high school jock to continue in a different, less restrained, location. Like the book, the show follows them both as they make their way through exciting and dangerous new phases. The success of Perrotta\u2019s big and small screen incarnations has a great deal to do with Perrotta himself, the author deciding to take a key role in each adaptation post-Election. Mrs Fletcher is no different, with him credited as creator and executive producer, but it\u2019s also in large part to the writers and directors he\u2019s chosen to collaborate with. In this instance, there\u2019s something so cosmically perfect about Perrotta teaming up with the writer-director Nicole Holofcener, the two sharing a great deal in common, both sharp and empathetic in how they capture everyday life without pulling punches. Holofcener has long been one of the greatest yet most underrated talents in Hollywood, from Friends with Money to Enough Said to her Oscar-nominated screenplay for last year\u2019s Can You Ever Forgive Me? For anyone familiar with her or Perrotta\u2019s work, it\u2019s a thrilling match-up. Mrs Fletcher brings out the best of them both, a funny, often daring, and never less than entirely believable series about how to navigate sex in the current moment. As the two are separated, Eve finds unlikely solace online in the world of Milf porn, quickly becoming addicted while college shows Brendan that his aggressively reductive view of women as sexual objects has no place in the real world. A lazier show would treat all of this with a far heavier hand but there\u2019s remarkably light-footed patience, intelligence and a total lack of judgment in Mrs Fletcher and while it might skate close to sitcom-esque scenarios, it never opts for cheap humour. It also manages to address woke culture in way that feels balanced and thoughtful, ridiculing some of the excesses (such as a well-intentioned yet misjudged college lecture on consent) while allowing characters the space to make and then realise the effects of their mistakes (a trans character is asked a crude question in one scene only to be met with a sheepish yet earnest apology a few scenes later). As perfect as Holofcener\u2019s direction might be for Perrotta\u2019s writing, Hahn is equally well-suited to them both. Her finest work has always existed in similar territory, most notably her role as a bored wife befriending a stripper in Jill Soloway\u2019s cruelly underseen 2013 comedy Afternoon Delight. She\u2019s long deserved a show of her own and Mrs Fletcher provides her with a fitting showcase, zipping between funny, sexy, awkward and self-righteous, a wonderful opportunity to see her explore a character for longer than 90 minutes. The show\u2019s pace is gradual, moments are allowed to breathe despite episodes lasting for just 30 minutes and cliffhangers are replaced with opportunities for us to think and discuss, the format never once cheapening Perrotta\u2019s wonderfully naturalistic storytelling. In the three episodes available, Mrs Fletcher promises to become something rather special, an acutely observed show that quietly covers a great deal without ever feeling overstuffed or sententious. And in the subgenre of Tom Perrotta adaptations, the streak remains unbroken. Mrs Fletcher is showing at the Toronto film festival and will begin on HBO in the US on 27 October and in the UK on Sky Atlantic later this year",

How my parents stayed relaxed at that stage helped me a lot. You need to make sure you don\u2019t take it too serious at times and that really helped me to refocus on the moment when the opportunity really arrived. I never regarded it as: \u2018Oh, here you go, here you have everything.\u2019 That\u2019s the new generation: take, take, take. No, no, no.

Football has taught me so much. I want to use that but still make sure there is some reality. You cannot turn the clock back 20 years.</p> <p>I had a totally different upbringing and background \u2013 raised in a small town in Germany. Now I am in London taking care of 180 kids who think they are the 1% who can make it in professional football. How do I manage that? By being myself, being authentic and not lying.

Has Jadon Sancho\u2019s decision to go overseas changed the landscape in academy football here? </strong>Yeah, I think so. We have, even from our side, academy players going to other countries. And we take value. So for us this summer was really positive \u2013 you had Alex Iwobi going to Everton \u2013 a player that established himself in the first team. Then we have Xavier Amaechi, who\u2019s gone to Hamburg and we get a fee and add-ons. Krystian Bielik, who went to Derby, has been a part of our academy.

You could feel that. But still there\u2019s a more positive energy I would say right now than there ever has been. And that has been part of having a massive change in the club.

It doesn\u2019t come across so often. He is a genius in terms of what he can produce. Once he gets the ball, he\u2019s rested, he thinks he plays in the park, he can deliver that ball that no one else can deliver. He has got that magical sense.</p> <p>He wants to be OK with everyone. He is not the kind of guy who approaches people and says: \u2018You need to do this, that and that.\u2019 He\u2019s a different character and sometimes I struggled with that. When I approached him and said: \u2018This is not what we do here,\u2019 I thought that sticks with us longer. For him it\u2019s: \u2018No, that\u2019s OK, I accept that, we move forward.\u2019 I was really pissed [off] for days and weeks. But he relaxes in those moments. I know how to take him and how to try to pinch him when needed. But, ultimately, it has to come from him if he wants to go to the next level. But he can deliver.

Then we have Xavier Amaechi, who\u2019s gone to Hamburg and we get a fee and add-ons. Krystian Bielik, who went to Derby, has been a part of our academy. Jeff Reine-Ad\u00e9la\u00efde goes to France because we knew he wasn\u2019t getting the pathway in the first-team. But he creates value with that move. What one thing needs to change to make Arsenal world-class again?You really want to build the best connection between players and fans, that everyone feels that this is the best club. So a real culture that everyone trusts each other that we can be world-class again. But there are many aspects. My point is that I want to make a world-class academy, that everyone feels we get the best talent towards the first team. The first-team manager right now wants to bring us back to the Champions League. The new technical director wants to deliver the best recruitment, which the club has not seen for a long time. So everyone has small targets but what I would say is, we want to have the trust and connection from the fans that the people in charge can deliver. Did Arsenal lose that? Definitely. You could feel that. But still there\u2019s a more positive energy I would say right now than there ever has been. And that has been part of having a massive change in the club. I felt always as a player that you want to make the Emirates a fortress, but to build that connection again the players need to really buy into that we want to go that way, and the fans will follow for sure. Finally, tell us about Mesut \u00d6zil \u2013 what\u2019s he like and why his Arsenal career has been so tumultuous? First of all he loves playing football. It doesn\u2019t come across so often. He is a genius in terms of what he can produce. Once he gets the ball, he\u2019s rested, he thinks he plays in the park, he can deliver that ball that no one else can deliver. He has got that magical sense. He wants to be OK with everyone. He is not the kind of guy who approaches people and says: \u2018You need to do this, that and that.\u2019 He\u2019s a different character and sometimes I struggled with that. When I approached him and said: \u2018This is not what we do here,\u2019 I thought that sticks with us longer. For him it\u2019s: \u2018No, that\u2019s OK, I accept that, we move forward.\u2019 I was really pissed [off] for days and weeks. But he relaxes in those moments. I know how to take him and how to try to pinch him when needed. But, ultimately, it has to come from him if he wants to go to the next level. But he can deliver. You have seen it.

      "body": "<p>As I gaze out at the throbbing hellscape in which we live, it is hard not to feel that a programme hymning the painstaking piecing together from ivory fragments of a figure that pushed back the estimated birth of human culture by 10,000 years is \u2013 very sophisticatedly \u2013 trolling us. Especially when last week\u2019s episode dwelt on the seventh-century Sutton Hoo hoard, which showed that Britain emerged from the dark ages much earlier than previously thought \u2013 and revelled in its mastery of exquisite craftsmanship and carefully nurtured international communications and relationships.</p> <p>But it probably wasn\u2019t the intention of Raiders of the Lost Past (BBC Four), especially given its ebullient presenter, Dr Janina Ramirez, an art and cultural historian who fills the screen with passion and expertise, and who seems likely to be the last uncynical person left standing when the End Times \u2013 I wanna say, Friday? \u2013 get here.</p> <p>This middle episode examining archaeological finds that changed our understanding of the origins of civilisation gave us the story \u2013 more gloriously incredible at every turn \u2013 of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/nov/06/living-with-gods-review-art-religion-british-museum\">the Lion-Man</a>.</p> <p>In the summer of 1939, in the Hohlenstein-Stadel cave in southern Germany, on the last day of a three-year dig in the last moments of peace before the second world war began, its supervisor, Robert Wetzel, found three shards of ivory. He salted them away in a cigar box and never mentioned them again. Too busy, perhaps, pressing his knowledge ever more firmly into the service of the Nazi party as they began their planned takeover of the world.</p> <p>His Stadel excavations, among many others, had been funded by the SS. Himmler was keen to prove his belief that human culture had its origins in ice-age Germany and thus demonstrate the superiority of the Aryan race. The six caves of the Swabian Jura, of which Wetzel\u2019s site was one, were a popular and fruitful spot. Much like others in Europe and doubtless the rest of the world \u2013 if, as one of the archaeologists in conversation with Ramirez pointed out, they had had the time and resources spent on them that this one has.</p> <p>The fragments languished in the storerooms of Ulm museum until 1969, when Dr Joachim Hahn was doing inventory and noticed that they were pieces worked by hand.

      "bodyText": "As I gaze out at the throbbing hellscape in which we live, it is hard not to feel that a programme hymning the painstaking piecing together from ivory fragments of a figure that pushed back the estimated birth of human culture by 10,000 years is \u2013 very sophisticatedly \u2013 trolling us. Especially when last week\u2019s episode dwelt on the seventh-century Sutton Hoo hoard, which showed that Britain emerged from the dark ages much earlier than previously thought \u2013 and revelled in its mastery of exquisite craftsmanship and carefully nurtured international communications and relationships. But it probably wasn\u2019t the intention of Raiders of the Lost Past (BBC Four), especially given its ebullient presenter, Dr Janina Ramirez, an art and cultural historian who fills the screen with passion and expertise, and who seems likely to be the last uncynical person left standing when the End Times \u2013 I wanna say, Friday? \u2013 get here. This middle episode examining archaeological finds that changed our understanding of the origins of civilisation gave us the story \u2013 more gloriously incredible at every turn \u2013 of the Lion-Man. In the summer of 1939, in the Hohlenstein-Stadel cave in southern Germany, on the last day of a three-year dig in the last moments of peace before the second world war began, its supervisor, Robert Wetzel, found three shards of ivory. He salted them away in a cigar box and never mentioned them again. Too busy, perhaps, pressing his knowledge ever more firmly into the service of the Nazi party as they began their planned takeover of the world. His Stadel excavations, among many others, had been funded by the SS. Himmler was keen to prove his belief that human culture had its origins in ice-age Germany and thus demonstrate the superiority of the Aryan race. The six caves of the Swabian Jura, of which Wetzel\u2019s site was one, were a popular and fruitful spot. Much like others in Europe and doubtless the rest of the world \u2013 if, as one of the archaeologists in conversation with Ramirez pointed out, they had had the time and resources spent on them that this one has. The fragments languished in the storerooms of Ulm museum until 1969, when Dr Joachim Hahn was doing inventory and noticed that they were pieces worked by hand. He fitted them together, along with 200 other fragments, to make the beginnings of the Lion-Man. It caused a public sensation, which led a woman to bring in a bagful of little white bits her child had been playing with since he collected them on a day out near the Stadel cave. One of them was \u2013 no, honestly \u2013 the Lion-Man\u2019s mouth. I always enjoy stories that show a use for children. Further investigations, reconstructions and explorations of the cave over the next 40 years yielded pretty much all of the 40,000-year-old figure, still the oldest piece of figurative art ever discovered. Its age and form exploded assumptions about what humans were capable of and when. Some 10,000 years earlier than anyone had thought, we had made that extraordinary leap of imagination beyond mere representation, we had a belief system that involved shamanistic figures and (presumably) rituals, and we had a community that could support someone taking an estimated 400 hours off subsistence tasks to make it.

      "bodyText": "Senior civil servants could be forced to break the law and face the possibility of prosecution if they help Boris Johnson\u2019s government defy the will of parliament, their union has warned. After No 10\u2019s insistence the government would not comply with an act designed to avoid a no-deal Brexit, the union has written to the prime minister demanding public assurances that Whitehall staff will not be asked to break the law or the civil service code. In the letter obtained by the Guardian, Dave Penman, the FDA\u2019s general secretary, wrote to Johnson saying the suggestion from No 10 that the government will ignore the settled will of parliament is causing increasing consternation in Whitehall. \u201cThe endless speculation that government will refuse to implement an act of parliament may serve short-term political interest, but as prime minister your responsibilities go beyond tactical political game playing. \u201cOnly you, as prime minister, can end this speculation. I am therefore asking you to categorically and publicly assure the civil service that no civil servant will be asked to breach their obligation under the civil service code to \u2018comply with the law and uphold the administration of justice\u2019,\u201d he wrote. Senior civil servants told the union they were concerned that if they assisted the government in defying the will of parliament as set out in legislation, they could be in breach of the law and therefore their code of conduct. According to the civil service\u2019s code of conduct, civil servants \u201cmust comply with the law and uphold the administration of justice\u201d. The union, which represents the UK\u2019s most senior government officials, sought advice from a leading employment lawyer after receiving queries from dozens of members across several Brexit departments who were worried about their legal position. Senior civil servants could face disciplinary action or even criminal charges in some circumstances if they complied with a government instruction to break the law, the lawyer warned. They could face a disciplinary panel or criminal charges such as malfeasance in a public office, the advice said. The European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act, drawn up by a cross-party group of MPs against a no-deal outcome and given royal assent this week, mandates the prime minister to seek a further extension to Brexit beyond the current date of 31 October to 31 January next year \u2013 unless Johnson has either secured a deal with the EU that is acceptable to parliament, or MPs have voted for no deal before 19 October. Downing Street has maintained that Johnson would neither resign, nor comply with the law to delay Brexit and has refused to explain how the apparent contradiction could be reconciled. Reacting to the union\u2019s letter, Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general who helped to draw up the rebel bill, said senior civil servants are deeply concerned by Downing Street\u2019s threat of ignoring the law. \u201cI could well understand that civil servants are getting increasingly worried by the extraordinary words, statements and behaviour coming from No 10 Downing Street. \u201cOur constitution depends upon people observing rules of honesty and integrity and we seem to be losing them very quickly at present,\u201d he said. Legal advice obtained by Labour from Matrix Chambers warned that if Johnson defies the law, the civil service will be placed in an \u201cinvidious position in so far as they may be asked to take steps that are either contrary to the law or seek improperly to circumvent the law\u201d. Lord Kerslake, the former head of the civil service, said: \u201cIt is quite extraordinary that there is even a question of putting civil servants in a position where they could break the civil service code and that ministers are seriously contemplating breaking the law. \u201cThis development confirms the very serious place we have now reached.\u201d The most senior official in each government department could seek a formal instruction called a ministerial direction if asked to commit an illegal act, the cross-bench peer said. \u201cPermanent secretaries, in their role as accounting officers, have a duty to seek a ministerial direction if their minister wishes to proceed with spending that they regard as illegal or poor value for money,\u201d he said. \u201cThere must surely be the prospect of such spending being incurred if a minister acts in a way that they know to be unlawful.\u201d Shami Chakrabarti, the shadow attorney general, said: \u201cThis is a scary moment for everyone, not least the law-abiding loyal public servants who are quite right to seek protection from a government out of control.\u201d According to a ComRes survey commissioned by the union, three-quarters (75%) of MPs recognise that attacks on the impartiality of the civil service have increased over the past three years, and agree that attacks on the civil service undermine public confidence and trust in the government (76%). Downing Street was approached for a response. \u2022 This article was amended on 12 September 2019 because an earlier version was incorrect to refer to Lord Kerslake as a Labour peer. He sits as a crossbencher.",

Other people have missed out, mine\u2019s not a special story. I am no different to Devin Toner, Owen Franks with the All Blacks or the other guys in the England team that did not go. It\u2019s a highly competitive animal is sport, especially rugby. The game moves fast \u2013 it doesn\u2019t wait. I can understand why there were deadlines. The team needed to prepare and, if I can\u2019t physically help them to prepare, I can understand why I wasn\u2019t needed.\u201d Hartley said he would like to ban playing professional rugby on artificial pitches, having injured his knee on Worcester\u2019s artificial grass in December. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with them,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d played the fortnight before and I\u2019d tweaked my knee in a game, then I played on an artificial pitch the following week and probably playing on an injury didn\u2019t help. If there\u2019s a platform to show my support for getting rid of artificial pitches, it\u2019s here. It might be suited to under-10s or under-12s but from a personal point of view I don\u2019t like them.\u201d However, Hartley insisted he had no plans to retire and believes he is back on track to play again for Northampton after spending his family\u2019s holiday budget flying to Philadelphia to see Bill Knowles, a world-class reconditioning expert who has worked with Andy Murray. \u201cI had a chance encounter with Eddie at Wimbledon [and he] suggested it,\u201d he added. \u201cI spent a fortnight out there, spent the family\u2019s holiday money. This guy is world-renowned, the best going. It was one-on-one for four or five hours a day. It is intense. I felt like I was not progressing how I wanted to before going out there. It has given me a nice little springboard to slowly go on the up.\u201d Dove Men+Care is an official partner to England Rugby. Follow @DovemenUK Twitter or @Dovemencare Instagram",

It made landfall on the Japanese Miyako islands, before weakening as it crossed the Korean peninsula at the weekend. Gusts reached 120mph on South Korea\u2019s Heuksando island, and three people were reported to have been killed. Hundreds of square kilometres of farmland in North Korea were flooded by Lingling\u2019s heavy rain, generating fears of failed crops and food shortages. Days later Typhoon Faxai made landfall close to Tokyo. It affected the Chiba and Kanto regions of Japan last Sunday and Monday, bringing torrential rain and gusts of more than 120mph. More than 100 flights were cancelled, including that of the Australian rugby team arriving in preparation for the Rugby World Cup.

Arizona\u2019s attorney general, Mark Brnovich, said the agreement included more money from the Sackler family, which had become a sticking point during the recent talks. \u201cTalks are progressing rapidly, but this is the quickest and surest way to get immediate relief for Arizona and for the communities that have been harmed by the opioid crisis and the actions of the Sackler family,\u201d Brnovich told the Associated Press. Sources with direct knowledge of the talks say that Stamford, Connecticut-based Purdue will pay up to $12bn over time and that the Sackler family will give up control of the company. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. The company and a group of family members have been sued coast to coast by US cities, counties, states and Native American tribes, accused of knowingly underplaying the risks of addiction and death from the branded opioid OxyContin. The offer is the same as one publicly reported several weeks ago. It was not clear whether the announcement signaled the end of the fraught negotiations to reach a nationwide settlement with Purdue or moved the talks into a new phase. The company and the family have vehemently denied all wrongdoing in the current cases, but have acknowledged talks to settle the matter. Purdue Pharma is set to tussle with states opposing its settlement offer in bankruptcy proceedings starting as soon as next week, people familiar with the matter said. Late on Tuesday, lead lawyers representing more than 2,000 cities, counties and other plaintiffs suing prescription painkiller manufacturer Purdue, along with more than two dozen states and US territories, were close to agreeing on an offer from the company and members of its controlling Sackler family to settle lawsuits in a deal valued at up to $12bn, the people said. More than a dozen other states remain opposed or uncommitted to the deal, setting the stage for a legal battle over Purdue\u2019s efforts to contain the opioid litigation in bankruptcy court, they said. States were expected on Wednesday to update a federal judge on the settlement offer\u2019s support, which remained in flux, the people said. Critics of the deal under discussion began weighing in on Wednesday afternoon. The New York state attorney general, Letitia James, who has sued Purdue and the core multibillionaire members of the Sackler family, said: \u201cWhile our country continues to recover from the carnage left by the Sacklers\u2019 greed, this family is now attempting to evade responsibility and lowball the millions of victims of the opioid crisis.\u201d She continued, in a statement: \u201cA deal that doesn\u2019t account for the depth of pain and destruction caused by Purdue and the Sacklers is an insult, plain and simple. As attorney general, I will continue to seek justice for victims and fight to hold bad actors accountable, no matter how powerful they may be.\u201d Purdue\u2019s board is scheduled to be briefed on settlement progress on Thursday, one of the people said. There remained a chance negotiations could fall apart and the company\u2019s plans, including the timing of a bankruptcy filing, could change. Leading multibillionaire members of the Sackler family, well-known wealthy philanthropists, have declined to revise their proposed settlement contribution of $3bn over seven years and another $1.5bn or more through the eventual sale of another business they own called Mundipharma, several people familiar with the matter said. New York, Massachusetts and Connecticut, where privately held Purdue is based, are among the states opposed to the current offer and have pushed the family to guarantee $4.5bn, the people said. Last weekend, the involved members of the Sacklers \u201crefused to budge\u201d after attorneys general in North Carolina and Tennessee presented the family with counterproposals they said had widespread support from other states, according to correspondence reviewed by Reuters. The lawsuits, which have in some cases targeted as many as eight Sacklers as well as Purdue, claim the family and company contributed to a public health crisis that claimed the lives of nearly 400,000 people between 1999 and 2017, according to the latest data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The suits allege Purdue aggressively marketed prescription painkillers while misleading doctors and patients about their addiction and overdose risks. Purdue and the Sacklers have denied the allegations. Negotiations over the family\u2019s contribution to a settlement have been at loggerheads. Purdue has been preparing to file for bankruptcy protection with the outlines of a settlement in hand. \u201cThe family supports working toward a global resolution that directs resources to the patients, families and communities across the country who are suffering and need assistance,\u201d Sackler family members said in a statement. \u201cThis is the most effective way to address the urgency of the current public health crisis, and to fund real solutions, not endless litigation,\u201d the statement added. Company representatives had no immediate comment. Since the potential deal only involves 22 states\u2019 attorneys general, with many more as yet unaligned, it\u2019s not clear if or when a plan can be agreed. It would involve dissolving Purdue in its current shape and forming another company that would continue to sell the company\u2019s narcotic painkillers with the income being channeled to the plaintiffs, according to the New York Times. Andrew Kolodny, an expert in the field of opioid addictions and the opioids crisis, said: \u201cIt\u2019s bad because states will be put in the position of profiting off the future sales of Purdue products and that should be a non-starter. They should not be paid back for the opioid crisis from the sale of opioids. It\u2019s inappropriate. No deal is better than a bad deal.\u201d",

Now, her family has to start the long process of becoming the child\u2019s sponsor.\u201d</p> <p>The majority of those newly arrived from Freeport on Saturday to the Port of Palm Beach on the cruise liner slipped quietly away, collected by family members already in Florida, or to hotels or private accommodation that friends, relatives and benefactors had secured for them.</p> <p>Of the <a href=\"https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/national-media-release/cbp-admits-first-mass-evacuees-bahamas\">857 Bahamian nationals aboard</a>, barely 60 got on buses for a Red Cross shelter set up at a recreation center in nearby Lake Worth on Saturday.</p> <p>Red Cross officials spoke of how they were focused on their immediate needs.</p> <p>\u201cThe county asked us to open the shelter temporarily for the people who are coming on this ship, but there is no rolling process, no ongoing process for additional people to be processed this way,\u201d Craig Cooper, national spokesman for the American Red Cross, told the Guardian on Tuesday. \u201cWe need to dispel any belief or assumption there is going to be an ongoing situation or absorbing people who are coming over from the Bahamas.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018Not looking for handouts\u2019</h2> <p>The humanitarian evacuation to Florida so far has involved just a few thousand of the estimated 70,000 islanders made homeless by the most powerful storm ever to strike the Bahamas.</p> <p>Those who have made it to Florida, however, have little time for politics.</p> <p>Some, like Areesha Marshall, 24, have more important concerns as they start to think about how to reconstruct their lives, such as caring for her three- and four-year-old children in a new country. \u201cNo one really knows when it\u2019s going to be OK to go back home,\u201d she told the <a href=\"https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-ne-bahamas-seeking-sanctuary-20190908-36csr7nudrhjhmkxymydbqurxm-story.html\">Sun-Sentinel</a>. \u201cThe situation is dire.\u201d</p> <p>Cooper, of the Red Cross, said the common theme among those at the shelter was a desire to rebuild. \u201cThey\u2019re not looking for handouts,\u201d he said. \u201cAlmost the first thing out of many of these people\u2019s mouths was, \u2018I need to get to work, I need to find a way to find a job here in the US. My family needs the money, I need the money, I don\u2019t want to sit in the shelter.\u2019\u201d</p> <h2>Amazing response</h2> <p>He pointed to \u201cthe amazing response\u201d to the crisis by the residents of Florida, itself still recovering from two major hurricane strikes in two years, Irma in 2017 and Michael last year.</p> <p>\u201cWe had a call from someone in Jacksonville, a property owner with 150 available places for people to stay, and other calls, individual homeowners who say they\u2019re not going to be in their house for the next three months, that type of thing,\u201d Cooper said.</p> <p>Support for the evacuees, who have arrived in Florida every day since the hurricane on relief flights, and on an armada of smaller private boats whose captains ferry supplies in and take victims out, has come from many quarters.</p> <p>For example, the Mastroianni Foundation, established by a family of prominent south Florida hoteliers, has provided rooms for dozens of displaced Bahamians in two hotels in Jupiter. \u201cThese people have been through the absolute worst days of their lives and have lost everything,\u201d chief executive Nick Mastroianni <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/mastroiannifoundation/posts/520809591794875\">said in a Facebook post</a>. \u201cThey will have a place to rest their head until they get their feet on the ground.\u201d</p> <p>Hurricane Dorian relief and support sites have also <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hurricanebahamarelief/\">popped up on social media</a>, with Floridians posting offers of accommodation in private houses or on Airbnb.</p> <h2>Strong bonds</h2> <p>Mostly, however, those who have arrived in Florida from the Bahamas have joined family members already living here, proof of the strong bonds and history between the Sunshine state and the Caribbean island nation. An estimated 20,000 Bahamians live in Miami and its suburbs.</p> <p>\u201cBahamians practically helped build Miami and Broward county back in the 1930s and 40s, so they have a deep connection,\u201d said Shevrin Jones, a Democratic state congressman of Bahamian descent.</p> <p>\u201cOutside of just being a vacation spot, Florida is a place where the Bahamian community migrated years ago for a better life for their families. They found that and now they call Florida their home. They\u2019re now looking for Florida to help build the Bahamas.\u201d</p> <p>Jones has been <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/09/07/758658173/florida-lawmaker-presses-trump-to-waive-visa-requirements-for-bahamians\">lobbying the Trump administration to waive visa requirements</a> and open an easier path to admission for hurricane refugees. \u201cI\u2019m almost sure if we would do our research the amount of people who would want to come here is not as many as probably going through the mind of so many,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe Bahamian people do not want to come to Florida to stay, it\u2019s like your nextdoor neighbor helping you after an ordeal with a place to sleep for a while. I\u2019ll keep saying it until I\u2019m blue in the face, this is a humanitarian effort and we have to think about if it was us, what would we want?\u201d</p>",

The political temperature rose further on Wednesday after the Miami Herald reported that immigration authorities detained a 12-year-old Bahamian girl on arrival at Palm Beach international airport, separated her from her godmother and placed her in a shelter for unaccompanied migrant children in Miami. \u201cTrump\u2019s cruelty against black and brown people knows no end,\u201d Jess Morales Rocketto, chair of Families Belong Together, said in a statement demanding the girl\u2019s immediate release. \u201cThis little girl came to the US fleeing Hurricane Dorian with her godmother at her parents\u2019 direction only to be classified as an unaccompanied minor and ripped away from her loved ones. Now, her family has to start the long process of becoming the child\u2019s sponsor.\u201d The majority of those newly arrived from Freeport on Saturday to the Port of Palm Beach on the cruise liner slipped quietly away, collected by family members already in Florida, or to hotels or private accommodation that friends, relatives and benefactors had secured for them. Of the 857 Bahamian nationals aboard, barely 60 got on buses for a Red Cross shelter set up at a recreation center in nearby Lake Worth on Saturday. Red Cross officials spoke of how they were focused on their immediate needs. \u201cThe county asked us to open the shelter temporarily for the people who are coming on this ship, but there is no rolling process, no ongoing process for additional people to be processed this way,\u201d Craig Cooper, national spokesman for the American Red Cross, told the Guardian on Tuesday. \u201cWe need to dispel any belief or assumption there is going to be an ongoing situation or absorbing people who are coming over from the Bahamas.\u201d \u2018Not looking for handouts\u2019 The humanitarian evacuation to Florida so far has involved just a few thousand of the estimated 70,000 islanders made homeless by the most powerful storm ever to strike the Bahamas. Those who have made it to Florida, however, have little time for politics. Some, like Areesha Marshall, 24, have more important concerns as they start to think about how to reconstruct their lives, such as caring for her three- and four-year-old children in a new country. \u201cNo one really knows when it\u2019s going to be OK to go back home,\u201d she told the Sun-Sentinel. \u201cThe situation is dire.\u201d Cooper, of the Red Cross, said the common theme among those at the shelter was a desire to rebuild. \u201cThey\u2019re not looking for handouts,\u201d he said. \u201cAlmost the first thing out of many of these people\u2019s mouths was, \u2018I need to get to work, I need to find a way to find a job here in the US. My family needs the money, I need the money, I don\u2019t want to sit in the shelter.\u2019\u201d Amazing response He pointed to \u201cthe amazing response\u201d to the crisis by the residents of Florida, itself still recovering from two major hurricane strikes in two years, Irma in 2017 and Michael last year. \u201cWe had a call from someone in Jacksonville, a property owner with 150 available places for people to stay, and other calls, individual homeowners who say they\u2019re not going to be in their house for the next three months, that type of thing,\u201d Cooper said. Support for the evacuees, who have arrived in Florida every day since the hurricane on relief flights, and on an armada of smaller private boats whose captains ferry supplies in and take victims out, has come from many quarters. For example, the Mastroianni Foundation, established by a family of prominent south Florida hoteliers, has provided rooms for dozens of displaced Bahamians in two hotels in Jupiter. \u201cThese people have been through the absolute worst days of their lives and have lost everything,\u201d chief executive Nick Mastroianni said in a Facebook post. \u201cThey will have a place to rest their head until they get their feet on the ground.\u201d Hurricane Dorian relief and support sites have also popped up on social media, with Floridians posting offers of accommodation in private houses or on Airbnb. Strong bonds Mostly, however, those who have arrived in Florida from the Bahamas have joined family members already living here, proof of the strong bonds and history between the Sunshine state and the Caribbean island nation. An estimated 20,000 Bahamians live in Miami and its suburbs. \u201cBahamians practically helped build Miami and Broward county back in the 1930s and 40s, so they have a deep connection,\u201d said Shevrin Jones, a Democratic state congressman of Bahamian descent. \u201cOutside of just being a vacation spot, Florida is a place where the Bahamian community migrated years ago for a better life for their families. They found that and now they call Florida their home. They\u2019re now looking for Florida to help build the Bahamas.\u201d Jones has been lobbying the Trump administration to waive visa requirements and open an easier path to admission for hurricane refugees. \u201cI\u2019m almost sure if we would do our research the amount of people who would want to come here is not as many as probably going through the mind of so many,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Bahamian people do not want to come to Florida to stay, it\u2019s like your nextdoor neighbor helping you after an ordeal with a place to sleep for a while. I\u2019ll keep saying it until I\u2019m blue in the face, this is a humanitarian effort and we have to think about if it was us, what would we want?\u201d",

A follow-up question from Elizabeth in Balmoral, demanding to know why he had deliberately lied to her and dragged her into a constitutional crisis was hastily deleted by an unseen hand that unplugged the power cable to the internet router. Um, let\u2019s move on to something a bit easier, Johnson burbled. When would we be leaving the EU? \u201cOn 31 October,\u201d he said. Though he couldn\u2019t say how. Or whether the Northern Ireland backstop would or would not be removed. Definitely. Maybe.\u2026 Andrea L from Westminster wanted to know if it was right to try to conceal the details of Operation Yellowhammer. \u201cVery good question, Andrea,\u201d Boris mumbled. He couldn\u2019t agree more. It was far better for people not to worry themselves about the fact that some of them would almost certainly die. They might even get run over and killed on their way home tonight. Or hit by an asteroid. With any luck. Then he wouldn\u2019t have to choose which bits of the plan not to reveal. The questions came thick and fast. Dom C was in C&amp;A and couldn\u2019t make up his mind whether to buy the green or blue puffa gilet. Green, definitely. It would go down a storm when they all got to meet some really poor people on their trips north. Carrie S wondered if he could buy some more dog food. Sajid J begged to be released from house arrest so he could announce the opening of a new duty free shop at Scratchwood Services. Kwasi K wanted all judges killed. Bit extreme, but he had a point. \u201cGosh,\u201d said Johnson. Was that the time? He had to bring the people\u2019s PMQs to a close. He\u2019d have loved to carry on but he was all wrung out. He\u2019d given so much of himself. No Clown Prince could have done more. He had the country exactly where he wanted it. A laughing stock. Classic Dom.",

      "bodyText": "A City banker has won a gender discrimination case after alleging she was paid hundreds of thousands of pounds less than a male colleague and was the victim of a drunken prank that included leaving a witch\u2019s hat on her desk. Stacey Macken sued the London office of BNP Paribas for \u00a34m on the basis of unequal pay, claiming she was discriminated against due to her gender and paid significantly less than a male co-worker with the same job title. She also claimed she faced harassment. Macken was recruited on an annual salary of \u00a3120,000. But just months later, a male colleague was hired under the same job title for \u00a3160,000. That same co-worker took home about \u00a3237,000 in bonuses over a five-year period, seven times more than the combined \u00a333,000 offered to Macken. An employment tribunal in London heard that Macken was often rudely dismissed by one of her bosses, who would brush off her questions by saying \u201cnot now Stacey\u201d. The phrase was used so frequently that her colleagues started to use the phrase sarcastically. Another boss subjected Macken to crude stories, including one about a friend who took part in sexual role play with his wife that involved fantasies about sex workers. The same senior banker would also answer the phone to friends by saying \u201chey sexy\u201d, or \u201chey fuckface\u201d. Macken told colleagues she was uncomfortable working with her male colleagues shortly after joining the French-owned bank in 2013, when they left a Halloween-style black witch\u2019s hat on her desk after a drinking session. Georgina Chapman, a former personal assistant to one of Macken\u2019s bosses, said: \u201cI suspected it was one of the drunk team members, because they were the only people in that area of the office the evening before, which, combined with their drunkenness, made them most likely to have done it. \u201cStacey was visibly upset and confided in me that she felt really uncomfortable working with those male colleagues, knowing that one of them had purposefully gone out of their way to leave a witch\u2019s hat on her desk.\u201d The tribunal heard that communication broke down between Macken and senior management shortly after she filed a grievance to BNP Paribas over her pay and claimed she was subject to hostile performance reviews. She received no bonus in 2017, when her bosses noted: \u201cStacey\u2019s inability to accept constructive feedback \u2026 has led to a cascade of comments, accusations and recriminations which has led to the breakdown of her relationship with the management of the bank.\u201d Her male colleague received \u00a370,000 in bonuses that year.

      "body": "<p>Seven bids, or merger proposals, for the London Stock Exchange Group have failed in the last 20 years and here\u2019s another that deserves to go nowhere. To succeed, the Hong Kong crew pitching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/11/hong-kong-stock-exchange-makes-32bn-move-for-london-counterpart\">a \u00a332bn proposal</a> would have to win backing from the LSE\u2019s shareholders, several regulators and, for practical purposes, politicians. Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) will struggle on all fronts.</p> <p>Investors\u2019 scepticism was obvious. The LSE\u2019s share price rose only 6%, a weak response to an offer boasting a notional 23% premium. But the reaction was fair. LSE shareholders are being offered a relatively small portion of cash (less than a quarter of the value of the offer), plus a 41% holding in an enlarged Hong Kong-based outfit.</p> <p>That structure lacks appeal. Some UK funds aren\u2019t allowed by their mandates to own shares outside UK indices. Others won\u2019t want prolonged exposure to a company where political events can whack the share price. Almost half of HKEX\u2019S board is appointed by the Hong Kong government, the one that has ineptly handled weeks of violent protests.</p> <p>As for the LSE\u2019s board, it has a decent strategy already. It is to buy Refinitiv, an information provider spun out of Thomson Reuters, for $27bn. The takeover <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/01/london-stock-exchange-agrees-22bn-deal-to-buy-refinitiv\">was announced last month</a> and was well-received . LSE\u2019s shares surged in value. The Hong Kong bid, in effect, asks the LSE to abandon that deal and build instead \u201cthe world\u2019s premier market infrastructure business\u201d.</p> <p>One see the attraction for a bidder that concedes the LSE\u2019s kit is better than its own. But it\u2019s hard to see why the LSE\u2019s chief executive, David Schwimmer, should be distracted by a few loose visionary lines about capturing capital flows between Asia and Europe. Monetising data, he has argued, is where the added-value action lies these days, and Refinitiv would get the LSE into serious competition with the mighty Bloomberg.</p> <p>The commercial calculation in the LSE boardroom might be different if HKEX were bidding mostly in hard cash \u2013 but it\u2019s not.</p> <p>Then there are the regulatory and political hurdles. HKEX has owned and run the London Metal Exchange for seven years without causing problems but a takeover of the LSE is far more important. City regulators would demand water-tight protections around the UK assets and, since the LSE owns the Italian bourse in Milan, the EU will have a view on handing control to a Hong Kong operator that Beijing, one can assume, would never allow to be sold.</p> <p>The approval process could take a year and the outcome would be uncertain. The Refinitiv deal, by contrast, is agreed and generates no political heat.</p> <p>Attempting to whip up some enthusiasm, Charles Li, HKEX\u2019s chief executive, rolled out the standard line about the bid being \u201ca vote of confidence in the UK\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Seven bids, or merger proposals, for the London Stock Exchange Group have failed in the last 20 years and here\u2019s another that deserves to go nowhere. To succeed, the Hong Kong crew pitching a \u00a332bn proposal would have to win backing from the LSE\u2019s shareholders, several regulators and, for practical purposes, politicians. Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) will struggle on all fronts. Investors\u2019 scepticism was obvious. The LSE\u2019s share price rose only 6%, a weak response to an offer boasting a notional 23% premium. But the reaction was fair. LSE shareholders are being offered a relatively small portion of cash (less than a quarter of the value of the offer), plus a 41% holding in an enlarged Hong Kong-based outfit. That structure lacks appeal. Some UK funds aren\u2019t allowed by their mandates to own shares outside UK indices. Others won\u2019t want prolonged exposure to a company where political events can whack the share price. Almost half of HKEX\u2019S board is appointed by the Hong Kong government, the one that has ineptly handled weeks of violent protests. As for the LSE\u2019s board, it has a decent strategy already. It is to buy Refinitiv, an information provider spun out of Thomson Reuters, for $27bn. The takeover was announced last month and was well-received . LSE\u2019s shares surged in value. The Hong Kong bid, in effect, asks the LSE to abandon that deal and build instead \u201cthe world\u2019s premier market infrastructure business\u201d. One see the attraction for a bidder that concedes the LSE\u2019s kit is better than its own. But it\u2019s hard to see why the LSE\u2019s chief executive, David Schwimmer, should be distracted by a few loose visionary lines about capturing capital flows between Asia and Europe. Monetising data, he has argued, is where the added-value action lies these days, and Refinitiv would get the LSE into serious competition with the mighty Bloomberg. The commercial calculation in the LSE boardroom might be different if HKEX were bidding mostly in hard cash \u2013 but it\u2019s not. Then there are the regulatory and political hurdles. HKEX has owned and run the London Metal Exchange for seven years without causing problems but a takeover of the LSE is far more important. City regulators would demand water-tight protections around the UK assets and, since the LSE owns the Italian bourse in Milan, the EU will have a view on handing control to a Hong Kong operator that Beijing, one can assume, would never allow to be sold. The approval process could take a year and the outcome would be uncertain. The Refinitiv deal, by contrast, is agreed and generates no political heat. Attempting to whip up some enthusiasm, Charles Li, HKEX\u2019s chief executive, rolled out the standard line about the bid being \u201ca vote of confidence in the UK\u201d. Thanks for that but the LSE, as opposed to the UK, is doing fine. Brexit hasn\u2019t obviously interrupted progress and the share price has more than doubled since the collapse of the planned \u201cmerger of equals\u201d with Deutsche B\u00f6rse in 2017. The LSE doesn\u2019t need a deal that offers little upfront reward and has serious long-term risks. Just say no. Mike Ashley faces direct intervention over audit Henry Ford reputedly never bothered with auditors at the Ford Motor Company in the US a century ago. Unfortunately for Mike Ashley, the Companies Act in 21st-century Britain is more demanding. Sports Direct does not have a choice. UK-listed companies must have their accounts audited, which means having an auditor. Sports Direct doesn\u2019t have one after Grant Thornton\u2019s formal resignation at Wednesday\u2019s annual meeting of shareholders so best to get a move on. Indeed, the timetable for publishing on schedule Sports Direct\u2019s half-year numbers, due in December, already looks tight. An incoming auditor needs time to understand the job, which is not straightforward in this case. The \u20ac674m (\u00a3605m) demand from the Belgian tax authorities is merely one of many complexities at Sports Direct. Last year\u2019s baffling purchase of House of Fraser out of administration is another. Ashley sounds determined to land a \u201cBig Four\u201d auditor as a matter of personal pride, even though all the main names are said to be resisting the honour. If it comes to it, the business secretary (that\u2019s Angela Leadsom this week) is allowed to intervene and volunteer somebody for the job. Such an outcome, you might think, would be a humiliation too far, even for Ashley \u2013 except he\u2019s surprised us in the past.",

From a promising position, <strong>Yorkshire</strong> lost six for 17 in barely seven overs, a short, sharp, shock compounded by Ben Coad falling sick and being unable to bat. Somerset strode gratefully into the distance, Tom Abell notching up his second fifty of the match, ably supported by James Hildreth.</p> <p><strong>Essex</strong> were finding the path to the pennant slurry\u2011filled as <strong>Warwickshire</strong> passed 500 in a game where batting seemed as easy as popping jelly babies \u2013 Matt Lamb scored a wonderful maiden first\u2011class century, 173 in seven hours \u2013 until Essex walked out. Alastair Cook was then promptly dismissed for seven. Simon Harmer deserved a luxurious bath after toiling over 59.5 overs, taking six for 143.</p> <p><strong>Nottinghamshire</strong>\u2019s look-away-now season continued at Trent Bridge as Darren Stevens responded to the news that his contract will not be extended with five for 39 to help bowl out Notts for 124. <strong>Kent</strong> did not enforce the follow-on and Zak Crawley and Sam Billings \u2013 scoring his first hundred of the season \u2013 took the lead past 400.</p> <p>James Vince led <strong>Hampshire</strong> to an almost-comfortable lead against <strong>Surrey</strong> with a flamboyant 91.</p> <p>The tension at Lords in Division Two was exasperating as the game ebbed and flowed in an enthralling encounter. A swashbuckling 22 not out from Miguel Cummins, holder of the second-longest duck in Test history, helped <strong>Middlesex</strong> add 56 late-order morning runs. A dogged 64 from Angus Robson, Sam\u2019s brother, held <strong>Durham</strong>\u2019s batting together, though every twinkling of comfort was pegged back through regular wickets until Robson opened his suitcase of strokes to push Durham\u2019s lead to 195. Middlesex safely negotiated the evening, leaving the match on a knife-edge.</p> <p><strong>Worcestershire</strong> delivered optimism for a rare championship win; five Glamorgan wickets for the resurgent Charlie Morris, while the openers, Daryl Mitchell and Hamish Rutherford, stroked half-centuries. </p> <p>At Old Trafford, Josh Bohannon achieved his first championship hundred for <strong>Lancashire</strong>, against <strong>Derbyshire</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Northamptonshire</strong> continued to march towards promotion as Richard Keogh scored a brutal 132 before a late collapse and three wickets from the <strong>Leicestershire</strong> debutant Alex Evans steadied the contest while on a stop-start day in Bristol, <strong>Sussex</strong> made good progress against <strong>Gloucestershire</strong> with Phil Salt thumping 64 with contributions throughout the batting lineup.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d793ad18f083106f4559ce0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-11T18:27:45.702Z\">7.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>And so day two of this round comes to an end,</strong> with many games already into their final act. The action at <strong>Lord\u2019s</strong> will be done and dusted before tea tomorrow, and one doesn\u2019t hold out much hope for <strong>Nottinghamshire</strong> or <strong>Yorkshire</strong>. <strong>Essex</strong> have the fight of their lives to bring much succour from Edgbaston and <strong>Surrey</strong> look in trouble at Southampton.</p> <p><strong>Josh Bohannon</strong>\u2019s maiden century has motored <strong>Lancashire</strong> towards Division One, <strong>Sussex</strong> have a handy lead against <strong>Gloucestershire</strong>, <strong>Northants</strong> have stumbled slightly at Grace Road and a stoical innings by Darryl Mitchell has kept <strong>Worcestershire\u2019s</strong> hope of finishing the season on a high alive. <br></p> <p>Thanks for all your messages BTL and to Will for his top-class blogging.

      "bodyText": "A calamitous morning collapse at Taunton swung the championship pendulum firmly towards Somerset. From a promising position, Yorkshire lost six for 17 in barely seven overs, a short, sharp, shock compounded by Ben Coad falling sick and being unable to bat. Somerset strode gratefully into the distance, Tom Abell notching up his second fifty of the match, ably supported by James Hildreth. Essex were finding the path to the pennant slurry\u2011filled as Warwickshire passed 500 in a game where batting seemed as easy as popping jelly babies \u2013 Matt Lamb scored a wonderful maiden first\u2011class century, 173 in seven hours \u2013 until Essex walked out. Alastair Cook was then promptly dismissed for seven. Simon Harmer deserved a luxurious bath after toiling over 59.5 overs, taking six for 143. Nottinghamshire\u2019s look-away-now season continued at Trent Bridge as Darren Stevens responded to the news that his contract will not be extended with five for 39 to help bowl out Notts for 124. Kent did not enforce the follow-on and Zak Crawley and Sam Billings \u2013 scoring his first hundred of the season \u2013 took the lead past 400. James Vince led Hampshire to an almost-comfortable lead against Surrey with a flamboyant 91. The tension at Lords in Division Two was exasperating as the game ebbed and flowed in an enthralling encounter. A swashbuckling 22 not out from Miguel Cummins, holder of the second-longest duck in Test history, helped Middlesex add 56 late-order morning runs. A dogged 64 from Angus Robson, Sam\u2019s brother, held Durham\u2019s batting together, though every twinkling of comfort was pegged back through regular wickets until Robson opened his suitcase of strokes to push Durham\u2019s lead to 195. Middlesex safely negotiated the evening, leaving the match on a knife-edge. Worcestershire delivered optimism for a rare championship win; five Glamorgan wickets for the resurgent Charlie Morris, while the openers, Daryl Mitchell and Hamish Rutherford, stroked half-centuries. At Old Trafford, Josh Bohannon achieved his first championship hundred for Lancashire, against Derbyshire. Northamptonshire continued to march towards promotion as Richard Keogh scored a brutal 132 before a late collapse and three wickets from the Leicestershire debutant Alex Evans steadied the contest while on a stop-start day in Bristol, Sussex made good progress against Gloucestershire with Phil Salt thumping 64 with contributions throughout the batting lineup. And so day two of this round comes to an end, with many games already into their final act. The action at Lord\u2019s will be done and dusted before tea tomorrow, and one doesn\u2019t hold out much hope for Nottinghamshire or Yorkshire. Essex have the fight of their lives to bring much succour from Edgbaston and Surrey look in trouble at Southampton. Josh Bohannon\u2019s maiden century has motored Lancashire towards Division One, Sussex have a handy lead against Gloucestershire, Northants have stumbled slightly at Grace Road and a stoical innings by Darryl Mitchell has kept Worcestershire\u2019s hope of finishing the season on a high alive. Thanks for all your messages BTL and to Will for his top-class blogging. See you tomorrow! Please excuse Will and me now while we write up the round-up - and as my fingers move over the keys, that\u2019s the penultimate wicket in the bag for Middlesex - Robson still there on 56. Durham 182-9. And. Out. Strides. Rushworth. Northants! They\u2019ve just lost three for 10 and are now 314-7, a lead of just nine runs against their midlands rivals. Kudos to young Alex Evans who on debut bagged Newton, Wakely and Rossington. Good to see Daryl Mitchell notch up his third fifty of what has been rather a slurry-coloured summer - averaging 23.79. Worcestershire doing much better second time round 153-2. Thanks Will. The autumnal bad light curse strikes - play abandoned for the day at Taunton, and play suspended at Hampshire. But a lovely dappled sunlight has descended over Lord\u2019s where Tim Murtagh briefly came off the field and sat on the pavilion benches amongst the members. Angus Robson\u2019s 48 in 198 minutes and counting for Durham is looking more and more crucial. Durham 167-8, the lead now 171. Just handing over to Will briefly for an expert eye... Just as Durham seem to be looking comfortable, yet again, Middlesex make the breakthrough to maintain the tension in this enthralling game. Angus Robson remains, holding the innings together on 45, in a dogged and determined knock, one which we regularly associate with his brother Sam. George Scott is the one to make the breakthrough, the young all-rounder with just his third wicket in First Class cricket for Middlesex, as Ben Raine chips to Dawid Malan at cover. Just an over later and Harris strikes again, pinning Carse for a Duck. 165 ahead with two wickets remaining - don\u2019t go anywhere! Jordan Cox retired hurt at Trent Bridge after being hit on the forearm by Paul Coughlin. A slight wobble when Crawley was out for 82 and Kuhn for 5, but Kent can afford to kick back and dust down the cocktail shaker. Notts already need 360 to win. With some teams, you might doubt the truth, worry they\u2019d dig in... We think Notts can be relegated this round as, assuming Notts lose in the next couple of days, the maximum number of points they can garner in the rest of the season is 102. Warwickshire already have 96 thanks to their batting points this round. Does that make sense? This is what they call pure joy. Bad light has stopped play at Taunton with Somerset 269-5 - a lead of 365. I hope Essex have set up a large bath with unlimited Radox for Simon Harmer. 59.5-15-143-6. Warwickshire, playing in some parallel universe where runs are jelly babies to be wolfed down with abandon, are all out for 517. Whoop! Congratulations to Josh Bohannon for his first Championship century: 101 off 177 balls. Lancashire 189-2. That\u2019s two debut centuries in one day - as Will points out, some succour to those who despair of long-form batting in England. As Ned Eckersley trudges off, an lbw so true for the umpire that his finger was raised almost before Harris had finished his appeal, we think that 200 would be too many for Middlesex to chew over. The current lead is 145. A wonderful century from Rob Keogh holding Northants together - I\u2019m wondering how many other players from Dunstable have scored first-class centuries? I\u2019m going to whisper it because Will is sitting next to me but Moeen has had a bit of a wild swing and been caught at long-off for 26. Worcestershire now have a lead of 119 over Glamorgan - with eight wickets in hand. And on Championship debut Scott Steel has been dismissed here for 39, chipping to mid-on. Durham 131 for five and looking good for 200. 91 off 59 balls - 18!!!!! fours. Hampshire 224-4. A typically sagacious piece by Andy Bull on cricket, cricket, too much cricket. I see Zak Crawley is unbeaten on 38 as Kent grind Notts into the dust. He must be in the running for Young Player of the Year - alongside perhaps a couple of the Somerset youngsters. Ollie Robinson and Hassan Azad are unfortunately just too old. If James Vince scores 175 against Surrey (currently 74 from 49 balls), how far will the pendulum have swung on the wintertourometer? Here at Lord\u2019s we have lost the second ball of the day, the first went into the Compton stand to sit amongst the debris, the second just disappeared under the advertising hoardings. Wow! Will oversaw a sensational collapse by Notts and nearly ushered Matthew Lamb to his double century. Quite something that innings, and double points for inching Somerset towards the line. They now have a lead of 292 and counting over Yorkshire. Thanks so much to Will who played a complete blinder on debut. I hope that the Ed (no, not that one) was watching and taking note. It\u2019s Tea here at Lords - a quick update around the country Division One Hampshire 149 all out (Clarke 5-21) and 150-3 (Vince 54*, Organ 54) v Surrey 162 all out (Pope 68) Kent 304 all out (Stevens 88, Kuhn 56) and 75-1 v Nottinghamshire 124 all out (Stevens 5-39) Somerset 199 all out (Abell 66; Maharaj 5-54) and 191-4 (Abell 62*, Hildreth 58) v Yorkshire 103-9 dec Warwickshire 468-7 (Lamb 173*, Hain 82, Sibley 51) v Essex Division Two Gloucestershire 200 all out (Bracey 61) v Sussex 181-4 (Salt 64) Derbyshire 244 all out (Godleman 111; Gleeson 5-64) v Lancashire 114-2 (Bohannon 51*) Leicestershire 308 all out (Azad 86, Cosgrove 65, Rhodes 61*) v Northamptonshire 201-4 (Wakely 72*) Durham 147 all out (Handscomb 54) and 94-4 v Middlesex 143 all out (Raine 5-26) Worcestershire 205 all out and 78-1 (Rutherford 52) v Glamorgan 193 all out (Morris 5-73) Worcestershire have somehow raced onto 59-0. New Zealander Hamish Rutherford has briskly moved to 43 off just 42 balls. Rutherford is back for Worcestershire after missing their T20 Blast Quarter-Final against Sussex, jetting out to Sri Lanka to replace another Worcestershire overseas batsman, Martin Guptill, who picked up a stomach muscle injury, depriving Worcestershire of both their overseas stars against Sussex. Rutherford was dismissed first ball in the third T20 for his country after all that travelling - let us hope he at least got some good air miles! Another quick wicket for Middlesex. Finn, bowling in a sleeveless sweater, pins Gareth Harte LBW without scoring - Middlesex are on a roll now. At Taunton, Banton seems to have remained in T20 mode, smashing 28 off just 30 balls so far with six boundaries. The home team now 269 ahead and surely in a great position for victory after their bowling exploits earlier today. Lancashire have started their reduced day well, moving onto 74-1, with Keaton Jennings and Josh Bohannon both well-set. James Harris strikes! After a dreadful start to the session, Middlesex have restricted Durham well and Harris dismisses Handscomb, the Australian looking unconvincing as supposed to his fluent 54 yesterday. That\u2019s 28 runs for three wickets in the last 16 overs. A finely poised encounter. Oops - there is the commentator\u2019s curse. Hildreth is dismissed by Adam Lyth for a crucial 58. Meanwhile, the in-form skipper Tom Abell moves onto 56 and is joined by the poster boy of the T20 blast this year, Tom Banton. Will Fraine is off the field for a depleted Yorkshire team with a knee injury - 142-3 They are still off for a mix of bad light and rain at the Ageas Bowl with Hampshire 150-3, whilst Nottinghamshire\u2019s season of torment is halted slightly as the valiant Luke Fletcher dismisses Daniel Bell-Drummond. Kent just the 218 ahead! And indeed those sunglasses will not need to be used as we come off for rain here at Lords. A good period of play for Durham who have watchfully moved onto 79-2, an 83-run lead. In another crucial game in the Division Two promotion race, Sussex are 181-4, a mere 19 runs behind Gloucestershire. Left-armer David Payne has picked up three scalps. And ... just as I finish typing, the brief rain shower has departed and the Middlesex players, led by Dawid Malan are back on the filed - game on! Cummins, one of a triumvirate of West Indian Test players drafted in for the final three rounds of Championship action (Kraigg Brathwaite at Glamorgan and Shannon Gabriel at Gloucestershire ), is bowling a testing spell. He has beaten the outside edge of Handscomb numerous times. Nevertheless, it is still gloomy here, and I find it very optimistic how the Middlesex fielders are almost all wearing sunglasses on the brim of their caps. Welcome to British Autumn! Another wicket for Middlesex. The Bajan Cummins, probably used to playing cricket in more exotic conditions than this, forces Steel to snick off for 39. Durham 66-2 with Australian Peter Hanscomb to the crease. In the Division One title race, Somerset are crusing at 120-2, James Hildreth, the best player on the circuit never to receive a Test Cap perhaps, scoring his third half century of the season. Henry Brookes has been run out for 46 at Edgbaston, ending Warwickshire\u2019s 105-run seventh wicket partnership, just the 405-7 they are! Advantage Somerset? Vintage James Vince some may say? A thick edge flies over the slips to bring up the Hampshire skipper\u2019s 50. Playing for a place on England\u2019s winter tours perhaps? Off just 37 balls too... woah Another dismal session for Nottinghamshire. Their last five wickets falling for just 20 runs. A five-wicket haul for Darren Stevens, the 24th of his career. Will Kent regret the decision to let him leave at the end of the season? Astonishing yet again from the 43 year old. Delight in the press box here as Worcestershire dismiss Glamorgan for 193. Just a 12-run lead but us \u201cPears\u201d will take anything on what has been a pretty dismal red-ball season with no wins in nine County Championship matches. Five wickets for Charlie Morris - a remarkable comeback story for the paceman who, after breaking through for Worcestershire between 2012-2015, barely featured for four years, with problems about the legality of his action, before returning to the side this season. He has not looked back, taking 36 wickets at just 20.78 so far this campaign. As wickets tumble throughout the County Championship, it seems England\u2019s own attempts to solidify their wafer-thin batting line-up have a new plan. Ben Stokes, struggling with a shoulder injury, will play as a batsman only. The absence of England\u2019s talisman in the bowling department has caused the selectors to balance the side with both Sam Curran and Chris Woakes. Durham fans will be fuming! Alex Lees and Cameron Steel, seemingly as comfortable as anything, have been involved in a calamitous mix-up. Lees hit the ball to mid-wicket with both batsmen hesitating before Steel sent the left-hander back after he had advanced. Murtagh\u2019s throw was taken and the bails removed by John Simpson. 51-1. Angus Robson, brother of Middlesex\u2019s Sam, comes to the crease. In other news in Division Two, Keaton Jennings and Josh Bohannon are batting for Lancashire after a delayed start against Derbyshire. Northamptonshire, unbeaten in six, and on the charge for promotion, are 96-2 in response to Leicestershire\u2019s 308, a maiden first-class scalp for The Foxes\u2019 Alex Evans starting proceedings. Charlie Morris has dismissed his fourth Glamorgan batsman, but the Welsh county look set for parity with hosts Worcestershire, just 31 runs behind with two wickets in hand. Finally, Sussex are looking solid at 161-2 with Luke Wells holding firm on 42* Don\u2019t tell the Essex players the Somerset score; if Matthew Lamb and Henry Brookes\u2019 80-run unbeaten seventh wicket partnership wasn\u2019t painful enough, Tom Abell and James Hildreth have pushed Somerset to 72-2, 168 runs ahead, a mammoth amount in a low-scoring game. Elsewhere in Division One, Nottinghamshire are now 111-8, still 193 runs behind, looking as if they won\u2019t trouble my batting points stat. The wonderfully named Felix Organ has been dismissed for 54 as Hampshire move on to 94-3, an 81-run lead over Surrey. Meanwhile, here at Lords, Durham have raced on to 48-0, having dispatched Miguel Cummins and Steve Finn for 40 runs in just 5 overs since lunch. Cameron Steel has briskly moved on to 32. Ah, this will slow it down. Ireland\u2019s finest Tim Murtagh has replaced Cummins from the Nursery End, where the building works behind him make the Compton and Edrich stands more reminiscent of a lower-league football terrace. Good afternoon everyone! In what must be one of the most common occurrences of the County Championship season, Notts have lost another wicket, with Steven Mullaney falling to Darren Stevens. For context, Nottinghamshire\u2019s 11 batting points is the fewest in both divisions of the Championship and it is no wonder that they are languishing at the foot of Division One. The wicket was the 500th First Class dismissal for the evergreen Darren Stevens. Well bowled sir! Just got back from a wander round Lord\u2019s where I sneaked into the pavilion and was strangely touched to see this MCC blend of old and new. An email comes in from Finbar Anslow: Hi Tanya, glorious day here in Milan, all the more so as I tucked into a juicy pizza whilst reading of Yorkshire\u2019s first innings demise. Dost mine West Country heart beat a little faster? Huge session coming up for Somerset,.......... And some news from Old Trafford - play will start at 1.40 and, weather permitting, will last 64 overs. I\u2019m now going to hand over to Will for half an hour or so - be kind! Thanks to Will for those lunch-time scores. Another wicket-heavy morning - though things slowed towards the end - with Durham showing some gumption here at Lord\u2019s. Just another 14 wickets needed to match yesterday\u2019s carnage. Reports from Taunton suggest that Ben Coad won\u2019t play today - out with an illness. I\u2019m going for a quick stroll to clear my head of tumbling wickets - see you all in half an hour! Division One Hampshire 149 all out (Clarke 5-21) and 77-2 v Surrey 162 all out (Pope 68) Kent 304 all out (Stevens 88, Kuhn 56) v Nottinghamshire 104-5 Somerset 199 all out (Abell 66; Maharaj 5-54) and 49-2 v Yorkshire 103-9 dec Warwickshire 360-6 (Lamb 106*, Hain 82, Sibley 51) v Essex Division Two Gloucestershire 200 all out (Bracey 61) v Sussex 116-1 (Salt 64) Derbyshire 244 all out (Godleman 111; Gleeson 5-64) v Lancashire 20-1 - no play before lunch, rain Leicestershire 308 all out (Azad 86, Cosgrove 65, Rhodes 61*) v Northamptonshire 63-1 Durham 147 all out (Handscomb 54) and 8-0 v Middlesex 143 all out (Raine 5-26) Worcestershire 205 all out v Glamorgan 131-7 The second hundred of the round goes to Matthew Lamb at Edgbaston. It is his first first-class hundred - bravo! Bad light has stopped play at Bristol in what seems a remarkably sane game in comparison with elsewhere. Sussex 116-1. A bit of breathing space between collapses at Taunton etc has opened up - so a chance to glance at the score at New Road. Glamorgan have advanced from their overnight 44-2 to 106-6. Worcestershire\u2019s youthful squad tap-tapping away: three for Morris and a joyful caught and bowled for Moeen. A poignant moment at Edgbaston this morning when Ethan Brookes was out for a duck in his debut Championship innings and had to negotiate the long walk back as big brother Henry walked out. Warwickshire 348-6; Lamb a so-nearly 99 not out. A second wicket at Taunton - making it a happy-clappy eight in less than an hour and half this morning. Somerset 17-2. Davies joining Vijay back in the pavilion. Abell and Hildreth back in the middle. I\u2019m looking forward to a trip to Tunbridge Wells next summer! They\u2019re up and at \u2018em again at Bristol, Sussex 100-1: Phil Salt out for 64. And Middlesex\u2019s morning hurrah comes to an end having got surprisingly close to Durham - just four runs separates the teams. The last three batsmen added 56 this morning, thanks to some old-fashioned welly from Cummins (22 not out), Finn and Murtagh. Rushworth 3-54, Raine 5-26. So what do we think - will Durham make three figures? A couple of wickets for Jamie Porter and another for Simon Harmer this morning at Edgbaston as Essex sniff the change in the wind blowing up from the south-west. Warwicks 324-6. Matthew Lamb 90 not out. Having said that, another wicket falls at Taunton - Murali Vijay collecting a duck to go with his seven in the first innings. Keshav Maharaj opened the bowling. Just saying. Somerset 4-1. This from the Yorkshire live blog this morning. Batting is certainly not easy out there, but it just takes one batsman to get a score and others to chip in around him and Yorkshire will be driving the game. So... Yorkshire are all out for 103, with Ben Coad not batting for reasons we don\u2019t yet know. THEY LOST 6 FOR 17 THIS MORNING. Somerset have a first-innings lead of 96. At ease, Lancs-fans. The Notts-up klaxon needs to be retired. We need a non-Notts-up klaxon instead. Currently 55-4, Duckett and Slater following where Libby and Nash led. And Ben Raine now has five for 17 - Middx the heady heights of 121-9, thanks to some surprise bat-throwing by Cummins. And it\u2019s all happening at the Ageas - Surrey all out, losing their last three wickets in seven balls, and Hampshire have already lost Ian Holland, Morkelled, for four. I don\u2019t really care about this story, but here it is if you want to read it. Yorkshire have lost a mere three for six this morning: Kohler-Cadmore, Patterson and Tattersall. Currently 94 for six, a satisfying large 105 runs behind Somerset. (Sorry Yorkies, I just really, really, really want Somerset to win.) I love having a wingman! Will has already come up with this fantastic stat on Middlesex\u2019s No. 8 Miguel Cummins, currently one not out: he holds the West Indian record for facing the most number of balls without scoring a run (45) and the second longest Test duck ever (95 minutes). He achieved this against India last month. Meanwhile Harris was bowled by Ben Raine for 14. Middx 97 for 8. I\u2019ve got Will, a young man on work experience from the Guardian here with me, and he\u2019s going to take over the blog for half an hour some time today - he\u2019s a county cricket fanatic who supports Worcestershire. You\u2019ll love him! And in other news, James Anderson is considering following Peter Siddle and turning to veganism to prolong his career. I don\u2019t think I linked this by Marina Hyde yesterday on Geoffrey Boycott. And this contribution from the admirable Graeme Fowler, who seemed to spend most of yesterday fire-fighting on Twitter. This is the view from the road behind the Compton and Edrich. The groundsmen and equipment have been moved to the spot between the pavilion and the Tavern stand. Good morning from Lord\u2019s where the floodlights are already on and the general sense of gloom suggests that play may be stop-start-stop-start-stop. Around the grounds, the news is mixed. It is wet at Old Trafford and we have a delayed start at Bristol. After a wicket-tastic day yesterday - and a sole century - the batsmen have some catching up to do. Who can raise their game?",

His great-grandmother had though. She arrived there aged 14, with $10 and a spot in steerage, and started a new life, first on the Lower East Side, and then in Brooklyn \u2013 hence the show\u2019s location. The clothes nodded to her journey via uncomplicated references to the nautical: sailors hats, anchors and deck shoes. In one particularly seaworthy ensemble, a jumper was emblazoned with the word Hate crossed out.</p> <p>It was this discovery of his family heritage that catalysed thoughts of New York, its \u201cnewness, revival and optimism\u201d, which manifested in the collection.

      "bodyText": "Michael Kors, a designer often cited as the beating heart of New York\u2019s fashion scene, enticed guests out to Brooklyn on Wednesday morning for his spring/summer 2020 collection. A choir of young New Yorkers chimed in with the opening bars of Don McLean\u2019s American Pie as models including Adesuwa Aighewi, Mica Arga\u00f1araz, Kaia Gerber and the Hadids walked wearing an anthemic collection of navy knitwear and red sweetheart-necklined dresses embellished with golden stars, white double-breasted blazers with shiny gold buttons and boxy blue and white striped bags and shirts. Guests, including the Roma star Yalitza Aparicio, the first indigenous person to appear on the cover of Vogue Mexico, filled the cavernous space, empty apart from benches and potted trees. This latest collection started with Kors\u2019s first trip to Ellis Island, he explained at a press preview the day before. His great-grandmother had though. She arrived there aged 14, with $10 and a spot in steerage, and started a new life, first on the Lower East Side, and then in Brooklyn \u2013 hence the show\u2019s location. The clothes nodded to her journey via uncomplicated references to the nautical: sailors hats, anchors and deck shoes. In one particularly seaworthy ensemble, a jumper was emblazoned with the word Hate crossed out. It was this discovery of his family heritage that catalysed thoughts of New York, its \u201cnewness, revival and optimism\u201d, which manifested in the collection. Kors described it as probably the most patriotic he\u2019s ever done. The show notes began with two words: American pie, an idea baked into the clothes via frocks decorated with crystals made to look like glistening cherries and lemons, served up alongside gingham bralets, blazers and wicker handbags that spoke of afternoon picnics in the Hamptons. Patriotic is an interesting word in these charged times. Kors is known to be a Hillary Clinton supporter, and described dressing Michele Obama as one of the proudest moments of his life, but he is tight-lipped on the subject of Melania Trump wearing his clothes. The show went hard on an undemanding, wholesome vision of America, with Kors unafraid to double down on a theme. The choir moved from McLean to Simon and Garfunkel\u2019s America and Woody Guthrie\u2019s This Land is Your Land.

Of these, 14.28m were filled by a worker, and they were being done by 13.3m people.

      "bodyText": "Amid the sour news on the economy one aspect has continued to retain some sweetness \u2013 jobs. Despite slowing economic growth, solid job growth has continued. While the unemployment rate has risen this year, it is easier to find a job now than it has been for many years. But what the latest labour account figures highlight is that with this good news is a worrying sign that now, more than any time in the past, people are working more than one job. The quarterly labour account figures are a work in progress by the Bureau of Statistics. They have only been gathered for two years now as they try to marry up the figures in the GDP numbers and the monthly labour force figures. They are one of the more fascinating sets of data for economists because they provide information not just on who is employed in which industries, but how many actual jobs exist \u2013 and the reality is that there are more jobs than there are employed people: In the June quarter this year there were 14.53m jobs available in Australia. Of these, 14.28m were filled by a worker, and they were being done by 13.3m people. The reason there are fewer workers than there are jobs is because, of course, some people work more than one job. Until now the ABS has only been able to provide us with the number of main and secondary jobs but not the same information on employees. In this latest release, for the first time we have a count of the number of employees working more than one job. In June there were 797,400 people working multiple jobs \u2013 a record 6% of employees. The figures also provide us with information about how many jobs are \u201csecondary jobs\u201d and what percentage of workers are working in more than one job. In June, 6.7% of all jobs were not actually that person\u2019s main job: The reason the two figures are not the same is because around 160,000 people work more than two jobs. What is interesting is that in the past six months, while the number of people working more than one job has increased by 6.6% (compared with the overall employment increase of 2.8%) there has been a large drop in the number of people working more than two jobs. This is why there has actually been a slowing of the growth of \u201csecondary jobs\u201d but an increase in the growth of workers doing multiple jobs. It would seem that most of the slowing in the growth of \u201csecondary jobs\u201d is actually a slowing of people working in a \u201cthird\u201d or \u201cfourth\u201d job. And while it is too early to suggest any link, it is interesting that since the start of March, while the unemployment rate fell, the level of people working multiple jobs rose: The figures also give us some insight into the fight for work across each industry. In the June quarter there were 247,100 vacant jobs, and 701,500 unemployed. This makes for 2.8 unemployed per vacancy \u2013 a very slight increase on the 2.7 per vacancy in December last year, but still a historically low level. Even if we add the 1.14m underemployed person who could theoretically be after one of those vacant jobs we still arrive at a relatively low level of 7.5 underutilised workers per vacancy: But what the figures show is that there is a great difference across industries when it comes to available work. It appears that the greatest percentage of vacant jobs is in industries with low levels of multiple job holders: We need to take some care with the numbers of unemployed per vacancy across each industry. The figures exclude 40% of the unemployed because the industry unemployment figures are based on the industry of a person\u2019s last job worked (within the last two years). This of course excludes people entering or re-entering the workforce and also ignores (knowingly) that people can look for work across a number of industries. But it is clear that while the level of vacant jobs in an industry appears linked to the level of multiple job holders, the fight for work is not. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The industries in which there are the fewest unemployed per vacancy are healthcare, mining, finance, and administration and support \u2013 industries that have quite varied levels of multiple workers. The labour account figures are a very useful addition to our understanding of the economy. The marriage of jobs with employed allows us to better understand what type of jobs are being created and in what industries. It also allows us to see the sizeable increase in people working more than one job. With 6% of all employees now working multiple jobs it means that there are as many people doing that as there are unemployed. In an era where job security and wages growth remain pre-eminent concerns, this new data will allow us to see whether the growing number of people working more than one job is a temporary rise, or a sign of things to come. \u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

On Wednesday Guardian Australia revealed that lack of policy certainty beyond 2020, when the renewable energy target would be phased out, had resulted in new investment committed to the clean energy sector falling in the first half of 2019 back to 2016 levels when Tony Abbott invited an investment strike by trying to abolish the RET.

Butler said there was \u201ca lot to celebrate\u201d in achieving the RET of 33,000 GWh despite \u201cquite a lot of adversity\u201d.

Di Natale said Taylor was \u201cdetermined to destroy\u201d the wind sector, citing praise for the minister from the anti-wind group Stop These Things as evidence. The Greens leader called on the renewable energy industry to \u201cstart playing hardball\u201d because they were fighting the fossil fuels industry that was \u201csupported no end by this government\u201d.

Neither of these things appears to bother Mr Netanyahu, who <a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Netanyahu-A-Palestinian-state-wont-be-created-586017\" title=\"\">refuses</a> to recognise the Palestinian right to national self-determination and statehood.</p> <p>The Likud leader framed his land grab as a defensive measure, yet \u2013 as Wednesday\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/israeli-tank-shells-hamas-positions-in-gaza-after-rockets-launched-at-south-1.7832420\" title=\"\">rocket exchanges</a> show \u2013 his country\u2019s military is busy on Israel\u2019s western flank, not its eastern one. Missiles can vault the valley, puncturing the security argument that it could provide a buffer against an Arab invasion or guerrilla infiltration from the east. Israel seized the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 war. It is worth noting that in 2001, in peace talks with Palestinians, Israeli security officials suggested an offensive utility for the Jordan valley, saying that if its peace treaty with Jordan was violated then the space afforded by the fertile strip could provide a useful way to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/arabs/PalPaper012501.pdf\" title=\"\">take action</a>\u201d. Given Israel\u2019s recent offensive strikes outside its borders, this might explain why security arguments have resurfaced.</p> <p>Just how warped Israeli politics has become is evidenced by the fact that the main opposition coalition \u2013 Blue and White \u2013 were incensed not by the idea of annexing the Jordan valley but that Mr Netanyahu had not <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/blue-and-white-says-netanyahu-copied-them-on-jordan-valley-annexation/\" title=\"\">credited them</a> with thinking of it first. The Jordan valley may not be the strategic asset it once was. But it has an undisguised potency in Israeli politics, as a Palestinian state was always thought to border Jordan. It matters not whether Mr Netanyahu wins or loses the election, since it is hard to see a Knesset that would block the land grab.</p> <p>Mr Netanyahu can also count on the support of Donald Trump, who has destroyed the United States\u2019 honest-broker role. The US president rashly recognised Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital and endorsed the illegal seizure of the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-48656431\" title=\"\">Golan Heights</a>. He has cut off humanitarian aid to Palestinians. Mr Trump\u2019s key Middle East officials \u2013 his ambassador to Israel, his son-in-law and his former special envoy \u2013 are all supporters of the <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/world/middleeast/la-fg-israel-netanyahu-occupation-20181107-story.html\" title=\"\">settler movement</a> to build housing in the West Bank for Israeli Jews in contravention of international law. Like Mr Trump, another rabble-rousing politician, Mr Netanyahu is prepared to sacrifice almost anything on the altar of domestic politics. He <a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Netanyahu-to-Likud-Party-The-occupation-of-the-Palestinians-is-nonsense-571162\" title=\"\">dismisses</a> the occupation, 52 years of Israeli military rule over Palestinians, as \u201cnonsense\u201d. Yet what is the <a href=\"https://www.btselem.org/jordan_valley\" title=\"\">upshot</a> of such thinking? Millions of Palestinians will end up living in segregated enclaves in the middle of the West Bank, with no real political rights and under separate legal and education systems. They will be dirt poor and under a permanent military occupation, with their movements curbed. How would the country reconcile a permanent occupation with its democratic ideals? Israel would not be building peace, it would be constructing a giant open prison. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s plans to annex Palestinian territory in the occupied West Bank \u2013 and, crucially, seize the bread basket of the Jordan valley \u2013 if he wins the Israeli election next week are not only illegal under international law but would, if enacted, make peace impossible in the Holy Land. Neither of these things appears to bother Mr Netanyahu, who refuses to recognise the Palestinian right to national self-determination and statehood. The Likud leader framed his land grab as a defensive measure, yet \u2013 as Wednesday\u2019s rocket exchanges show \u2013 his country\u2019s military is busy on Israel\u2019s western flank, not its eastern one. Missiles can vault the valley, puncturing the security argument that it could provide a buffer against an Arab invasion or guerrilla infiltration from the east. Israel seized the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 war. It is worth noting that in 2001, in peace talks with Palestinians, Israeli security officials suggested an offensive utility for the Jordan valley, saying that if its peace treaty with Jordan was violated then the space afforded by the fertile strip could provide a useful way to \u201ctake action\u201d. Given Israel\u2019s recent offensive strikes outside its borders, this might explain why security arguments have resurfaced. Just how warped Israeli politics has become is evidenced by the fact that the main opposition coalition \u2013 Blue and White \u2013 were incensed not by the idea of annexing the Jordan valley but that Mr Netanyahu had not credited them with thinking of it first. The Jordan valley may not be the strategic asset it once was. But it has an undisguised potency in Israeli politics, as a Palestinian state was always thought to border Jordan. It matters not whether Mr Netanyahu wins or loses the election, since it is hard to see a Knesset that would block the land grab. Mr Netanyahu can also count on the support of Donald Trump, who has destroyed the United States\u2019 honest-broker role. The US president rashly recognised Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital and endorsed the illegal seizure of the Golan Heights. He has cut off humanitarian aid to Palestinians. Mr Trump\u2019s key Middle East officials \u2013 his ambassador to Israel, his son-in-law and his former special envoy \u2013 are all supporters of the settler movement to build housing in the West Bank for Israeli Jews in contravention of international law. Like Mr Trump, another rabble-rousing politician, Mr Netanyahu is prepared to sacrifice almost anything on the altar of domestic politics. He dismisses the occupation, 52 years of Israeli military rule over Palestinians, as \u201cnonsense\u201d. Yet what is the upshot of such thinking? Millions of Palestinians will end up living in segregated enclaves in the middle of the West Bank, with no real political rights and under separate legal and education systems. They will be dirt poor and under a permanent military occupation, with their movements curbed. How would the country reconcile a permanent occupation with its democratic ideals? Israel would not be building peace, it would be constructing a giant open prison.",

      "bodyText": "More than half a million people have gathered in Barcelona on Catalonia\u2019s national day (Diada) to renew calls for regional independence as Spain awaits the verdict in the landmark trial of 12 separatist leaders over the failed breakaway bid two years ago. Despite the politically charged atmosphere, police in the Catalan capital said that around 600,000 people had taken part in the annual event \u2013 dramatically down on the 1 million who turned out for the previous two Diadas. Although the occasion officially commemorates the fall of Barcelona at the end of the Spanish war of succession in 1714, in recent years pro-independence groups have used it as a show of strength and a means to focus attention on the cause. When the independence movement first erupted in 2012, 1.5 million people took part in the Diada, rising to 1.8 million two years later. This year\u2019s decreased turnout \u2013 the lowest in seven years \u2013 comes amid growing splits, squabbling and uncertainty within the secessionist movement. Speaking on the eve of the Diada, Catalonia\u2019s pro-independence regional president, Quim Torra, had urged people to \u201ctake to the streets and squares to proclaim our full and non-negotiable commitment to democracy, to social, civil and political rights, and to the flag of freedom, always and everywhere\u201d. In a tacit acknowledgment of the unsuccessful unilateral push for regional independence led by his predecessor, Carles Puigdemont, Torra added: \u201cIf we\u2019re not yet free, it\u2019s because we haven\u2019t yet reached the end of the path.\u201d While Torra also insisted that \u201call peaceful, democratic struggles must be able to prosper if they have the backing of the majority of citizens\u201d, pro-independence parties have never managed to attract 50% of the vote in regional elections and Catalonia remains fairly evenly split over the question of independence. A Catalan government poll in July suggested 48.3% of Catalans are against the creation of an independent state and 44% in favour. Two years after Puigdemont\u2019s government held a unilateral independence referendum in defiance of the Spanish courts and constitution and then unilaterally declared independence, the issue remains bitterly divisive. Spain\u2019s acting prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, alluded to the independence movement\u2019s co-opting of the Diada in parliament on Wednesday morning, saying: \u201cLet\u2019s hope we\u2019re getting close to the day when the Diada is a day of celebration for all the men and women of Catalonia.\u201d Although S\u00e1nchez has shown himself far more willing to discuss the Catalan issue than his predecessor, Mariano Rajoy, he has also firmly ruled out a referendum on self-determination. Efforts to find a way out of the impasse have been complicated by the trial of the dozen separatist leaders, including Puigdemont\u2019s former deputy, Oriol Junqueras, over their alleged roles in the push for independence. Nine of them \u2013 including Junqueras, the former speaker of the Catalan parliament Carme Forcadell, and two influential grassroots activists, Jordi Cuixart and Jordi S\u00e0nchez \u2013 are accused of rebellion, which carries a prison sentence of up to 25 years. Other charges include sedition and misuse of public funds. Puigdemont, who fled to Belgium after Rajoy used the constitution to sack his administration and assume direct control of Catalonia, has now been in self-imposed exile for almost two years. With the supreme court\u2019s verdict expected in the next month, the Catalan government and the independence movement as a whole are weighing up their response. In the lead-up to the rally, the streets of Barcelona had filled with people waving striped red-and-yellow Catalan flags and wearing T-shirts bearing separatist slogans. \u201cIf we, the people, don\u2019t take action, all these years will have been for nothing,\u201d Marc Casanova, a 37-year-old teacher, told Agence France-Presse. He said that, once the verdicts had been handed down, Catalans should follow the example of the \u201cyellow vest\u201d demonstrators in France and block roads, ports and airports \u2013 \u201cbut without the violence or vandalism\u201d. Earlier this week the regional vice-president, Pere Aragon\u00e8s, said the court\u2019s decision could trigger \u201cmassive, peaceful civil demonstrations\u201d and lead to the formation of a regional \u201cgovernment of national unity\u201d to try to force the Spanish government to seek a negotiated, political solution. The independence movement has lost momentum as different blocs argue over the best way forward. Torra and Puigdemont favour a continuing confrontation with Madrid, while Junqueras and Aragon\u00e8s\u2019 Catalan Republican Left party are more inclined towards negotiations. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in politicians,\u201d Cristina Montero, who attended the march with her partner and teenage son, told Reuters. \u201cI believe in the sentiment of the people coming here.\u201d",

They are epitomised by a fictional high-street fashion mogul called Sir Richard \u201cGreedy\u201d McCreadie as he prepares for a monumentally tasteless, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/jan/12/how-fyre-festival-went-up-in-flames-bella-hadid-ja-rule\">Fyre festival</a>-ish, Roman-themed 60th birthday party on the plutocrats\u2019 island of Mykonos. (Rome in Greece? Why not?)<br><br>McCreadie has just suffered a nightmare of bad publicity following a catastrophic performance in front of a parliamentary select committee, and all the celebs are starting to pull out of his bash. One star who will be there is Clarence, a real, live lion for a re-creation of the Coloseum scene from the movie Gladiator. There\u2019s no need to wonder if that might go horribly, black-comically and symbolically wrong.<br><br>This is, of course, all a caricature of the Topshop supremo <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/philip-green\">Philip Green</a>. McCreadie is played by Steve Coogan with a tan, an open-necked shirt, alpha-male silver-grey hair and emulsion-white teeth. It is a nice enough performance from Coogan, but this excellent actor is not especially challenged by the shallow, if entertaining, role as it is written, and his technical skill in performance is perhaps best shown most in a tiny moment when he impersonates Bert Lahr as the Cowardly Lion from The Wizard of Oz.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NNZHlIoA4U\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7NNZHlIoA4U?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Isla Fisher plays Sir Richard\u2019s first wife, in whose name all his tax-avoiding profits were originally registered in Monaco \u2013 though whether their divorce meant McCreadie had to take a financial hit isn\u2019t entirely clear. (Philip Green, who has precisely this financial arrangement with his wife Tina, is not divorced.) Shirley Henderson gives an enjoyably robust performance as his elderly Irish mum; Sarah Solemani plays the harassed assistant whose job it is to book Elton John to play at the party; Asa Butterfield is the stroppy teen son with an Oedipal resentment of his dad; and David Mitchell plays a cynical and self-hating journalist-turned-biographer whom Sir Richard has hired to write a sycophantic authorised life.</p> <p>The movie rattles along in mockumentary style, giving us a moment-by-moment display of this hideous carnival of vanity and suppressed despair. But compared to, say, lethally funny TV such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/succession\">Succession</a>, or indeed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/veep\">Veep</a>, which Gray also worked on, Greed isn\u2019t especially penetrating about money or power. It comes alive most satisfyingly in the flashbacks showing McCreadie as an obnoxious public schoolboy (played by Jamie Blackley), and there is a clever montage imagining all the grisly high-street clothing stores with names like Xcellent that he has set up and put out of business over the years. Scenes in Sri Lanka show how he has brutally exploited developing-world labour - and always with screeching, bullying self-pity, as though they are exploiting him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2122b9496de68ccb38034b5dc427d569e335d03e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2122b9496de68ccb38034b5dc427d569e335d03e/0_129_3549_2129/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rome on Mykenos \u2026 Isla Fisher, Coogan and Asa Butterfield in Greed.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rome on Mykenos \u2026 Isla Fisher, Coogan and Asa Butterfield in Greed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sony Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Winterbottom chucks everything up to and including the kitchen sink into this movie: sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn\u2019t. Like many films, Greed rather casually brings in the subject of refugees to bolster the drama\u2019s moral and political seriousness: there are some unsightly Syrian refugees on the Mykonos beach that Sir Richard would like removed \u2013 but in truth this subject is not very important to the film.

      "bodyText": "That exhilaratingly prolific film-maker Michael Winterbottom \u2013 working with additional material from Sean Gray from The Thick of It \u2013 has served up a breezy, funny, unsubtle scattershot satire-melodrama all about the moral squalor of the super-rich. They are epitomised by a fictional high-street fashion mogul called Sir Richard \u201cGreedy\u201d McCreadie as he prepares for a monumentally tasteless, Fyre festival-ish, Roman-themed 60th birthday party on the plutocrats\u2019 island of Mykonos. (Rome in Greece? Why not?) McCreadie has just suffered a nightmare of bad publicity following a catastrophic performance in front of a parliamentary select committee, and all the celebs are starting to pull out of his bash. One star who will be there is Clarence, a real, live lion for a re-creation of the Coloseum scene from the movie Gladiator. There\u2019s no need to wonder if that might go horribly, black-comically and symbolically wrong. This is, of course, all a caricature of the Topshop supremo Philip Green. McCreadie is played by Steve Coogan with a tan, an open-necked shirt, alpha-male silver-grey hair and emulsion-white teeth. It is a nice enough performance from Coogan, but this excellent actor is not especially challenged by the shallow, if entertaining, role as it is written, and his technical skill in performance is perhaps best shown most in a tiny moment when he impersonates Bert Lahr as the Cowardly Lion from The Wizard of Oz. Isla Fisher plays Sir Richard\u2019s first wife, in whose name all his tax-avoiding profits were originally registered in Monaco \u2013 though whether their divorce meant McCreadie had to take a financial hit isn\u2019t entirely clear. (Philip Green, who has precisely this financial arrangement with his wife Tina, is not divorced.) Shirley Henderson gives an enjoyably robust performance as his elderly Irish mum; Sarah Solemani plays the harassed assistant whose job it is to book Elton John to play at the party; Asa Butterfield is the stroppy teen son with an Oedipal resentment of his dad; and David Mitchell plays a cynical and self-hating journalist-turned-biographer whom Sir Richard has hired to write a sycophantic authorised life. The movie rattles along in mockumentary style, giving us a moment-by-moment display of this hideous carnival of vanity and suppressed despair. But compared to, say, lethally funny TV such as Succession, or indeed Veep, which Gray also worked on, Greed isn\u2019t especially penetrating about money or power. It comes alive most satisfyingly in the flashbacks showing McCreadie as an obnoxious public schoolboy (played by Jamie Blackley), and there is a clever montage imagining all the grisly high-street clothing stores with names like Xcellent that he has set up and put out of business over the years. Scenes in Sri Lanka show how he has brutally exploited developing-world labour - and always with screeching, bullying self-pity, as though they are exploiting him. Winterbottom chucks everything up to and including the kitchen sink into this movie: sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn\u2019t. Like many films, Greed rather casually brings in the subject of refugees to bolster the drama\u2019s moral and political seriousness: there are some unsightly Syrian refugees on the Mykonos beach that Sir Richard would like removed \u2013 but in truth this subject is not very important to the film. There is a fair bit to enjoy here, including some interesting details. Will Elton John really play your party for $1m? Will Tom Jones really do it for $350,000, and will James Blunt play a single song for 75 grand? Is that what he charged for his cameo here? \u2022 This article was amended on 12 September 2019 to correctly describe Sean Gray\u2019s writing credit on Greed. \u2022Greed screened at the Toronto film festival and goes on release in the UK on 22 November.",

First, the election campaign will have to be in opposition to the whole Brexit deal, with a commitment to a second vote, rather than on the narrower, though crucial, opposition to a no-deal Brexit. As yet Corbyn is far from being clear enough on the broader question. Second, all the negotiations on presenting a single anti-Brexit candidate in key seats are predicated on maximising the pro second ballot vote. On this the evidence is that a Corbyn-led \u201cunity\u201d ticket will inhibit a large tranche of voters from voting for it. It may even put off some Conservative rebels from standing on the ticket.</p> <p>Toynbee can point to some straws in the wind showing a lessening of the lethal nature of the Corbyn brand, but two years on from a general election, with a Conservative government in dire straits and disarray, the main opposition party should be 20 points ahead in the opinion polls, not 10 points behind. Toynbee\u2019s persuasive skills should be directed at persuading Corbyn to suspend his Labour leadership for the brief period involved, in favour of an interim leader who can unite the anti-Brexit forces and attract the maximum vote. There are senior Labour politicians with experience of government and of leadership who can fulfil this role.

      "bodyText": "There is much good sense in Polly Toynbee\u2019s case for Jeremy Corbyn being the figurehead for opposition to a no-deal Brexit at the forthcoming general election, (If Johnson quits MPs should back Corbyn to avoid no deal, 10 September), but it has two significant flaws. First, the election campaign will have to be in opposition to the whole Brexit deal, with a commitment to a second vote, rather than on the narrower, though crucial, opposition to a no-deal Brexit. As yet Corbyn is far from being clear enough on the broader question. Second, all the negotiations on presenting a single anti-Brexit candidate in key seats are predicated on maximising the pro second ballot vote. On this the evidence is that a Corbyn-led \u201cunity\u201d ticket will inhibit a large tranche of voters from voting for it. It may even put off some Conservative rebels from standing on the ticket. Toynbee can point to some straws in the wind showing a lessening of the lethal nature of the Corbyn brand, but two years on from a general election, with a Conservative government in dire straits and disarray, the main opposition party should be 20 points ahead in the opinion polls, not 10 points behind. Toynbee\u2019s persuasive skills should be directed at persuading Corbyn to suspend his Labour leadership for the brief period involved, in favour of an interim leader who can unite the anti-Brexit forces and attract the maximum vote. There are senior Labour politicians with experience of government and of leadership who can fulfil this role. Normal political service can be resumed as soon as the immediate objective is gained. Michael Meadowcroft Leeds \u2022 Polly Toynbee blames \u201cunthinking, knee-jerk Corbynphobia\u201d on the Sun, the Mail, the Sunday Times whose \u201cscare stories \u2026 stoke the terror\u201d of Marxism, Stalinism etc. But far more insidious has been the constant undermining of the Labour leader by columnists like Toynbee and the willingness of all media, with the exception of the Morning Star, to provide a platform for the Corbyn knockers, including Labour MPs who have never accepted our members\u2019 choice of leader. The obsession with getting rid of Corbyn has allowed the real threat from the hard right to flourish, as many of us predicted.

I suspect that part of the reason for the scepticism about Mr Lennon\u2019s claim to be black is that his parents were Irish, and there is a mistaken notion that Ireland, unlike England, didn\u2019t have a significant black African component in its population in earlier centuries whose genes would be present in the gene pool of people today.</p> <p>But that is quite wrong. Numbers might not have been as high as in England, but there were almost certainly more than 1,000 Africans in late-18th-century Ireland, and, my research suggests, between 3,000 and 10,000 who were black or mixed-race in the mid-19th century. Therefore many apparently white Irish people today could have African recessive genes in their DNA, and these might be expected to appear in some individuals.<br><strong>Dr William Hart</strong><br><em>Armoy, Co Antrim</em></p> <p>\u2022 The story of Anthony Ekundayo Lennon is an important one \u2013 a man who was assumed to be mixed-race is challenged as white, but proves that he is mixed-race.

We must expect and accept that many more people will self-identify in a way that does not necessarily accord with what others think or see.

      "bodyText": "My attention was gripped by Simon Hattenstone\u2019s article (The Man in the Mirror, Weekend, 7 September) on Anthony Ekundayo Lennon\u2019s struggle to be recognised as a black man of Irish white parents. I suspect that part of the reason for the scepticism about Mr Lennon\u2019s claim to be black is that his parents were Irish, and there is a mistaken notion that Ireland, unlike England, didn\u2019t have a significant black African component in its population in earlier centuries whose genes would be present in the gene pool of people today. But that is quite wrong. Numbers might not have been as high as in England, but there were almost certainly more than 1,000 Africans in late-18th-century Ireland, and, my research suggests, between 3,000 and 10,000 who were black or mixed-race in the mid-19th century. Therefore many apparently white Irish people today could have African recessive genes in their DNA, and these might be expected to appear in some individuals. Dr William Hart Armoy, Co Antrim \u2022 The story of Anthony Ekundayo Lennon is an important one \u2013 a man who was assumed to be mixed-race is challenged as white, but proves that he is mixed-race. To look black or white but not to identify as such, to have an identity imposed upon you, is an issue for our time. Many more people will have dual and multiple ethnicities as the \u201cmixed\u201d population grows. People in Harmony, an organisation supporting mixed-race people, continues to use \u201cmixed race\u201d as the preferred term. We must expect and accept that many more people will self-identify in a way that does not necessarily accord with what others think or see. As a society we need to respect this and ensure we do not make judgments that are inaccurate \u2013 and, increasingly, irrelevant.

      "body": "<h2>Lindsay Hoyle</h2> <p>Currently the bookmakers\u2019 slight favourite over Harriet Harman, Hoyle has been the Labour MP for Chorley since 1997 and a deputy speaker since 2010. His father is Doug Hoyle, a former Labour MP who is now a peer. Hoyle, who is seen as a less contentious figure than John Bercow when in the Speaker\u2019s chair, has never declared his views on Brexit.</p> <h2>Harriet Harman</h2> <p>The longest-serving female MP, Harman has represented Peckham (later Camberwell and Peckham) since 1982 and spent 30 years on the Labour frontbench, including two stints as acting party leader in 2010 and 2015. She is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/10/harriet-harman-vows-to-be-scrupulously-neutral-if-elected-as-speaker\">standing as an avowed reformer</a> who has spent decades trying to make the House of Commons a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/12/mps-to-propose-allowing-proxy-votes-for-members-absent-for-family-reasons\">better place to work</a>.</p> <h2>Eleanor Laing</h2> <p>Also a deputy speaker, Laing has been the Conservative MP for Epping Forest since 1997. Before taking the role in the Speaker\u2019s Office, she spent a dozen years filling various roles on the opposition frontbench, including a brief stint as shadow Scotland secretary. In 2009, Laing <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/6442038/MPs-expenses-Eleanor-Laing-reselected.html\">faced a confidence vote</a> in her constituency after it emerged she had avoided paying capital gains tax on two Westminster flats.</p> <h2>Chris Bryant</h2> <p>The Labour MP for Rhondda\u2019s long stint on the frontbench, including as shadow culture secretary and shadow Commons leader, ended when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/27/labour-resignations-continue-as-mps-try-to-force-out-jeremy-corbyn\">joined the 2016 exodus</a> over Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership. A self-professed Commons procedure buff \u2013 he has written a two-volume history of parliament \u2013 Bryant, who has been an MP since 2001, has pledged to be a neutral Speaker who would increase the power of MPs.</p> <h2>Meg Hillier</h2> <p>Another Labour MP, representing Hackney South and Shoreditch since 2005, Hillier chairs of the influential public accounts committee. The former councillor and London Assembly member spent four years on the Labour frontbench, including as shadow energy secretary.</p> <h2>Edward Leigh</h2> <p>Almost as long serving as Harman \u2013 he has represented Gainsborough (formerly Gainsborough and Horncastle) since 1983 \u2013 Leigh is an inveterate Conservative rebel and a Brexiter of sufficiently long standing to have been sacked by John Major for voting against the Maastricht treaty. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/19/ministers-paving-way-for-tyranny-by-ignoring-universal-credit-vote-edward-leigh\">Known as an independent MP</a> who opposed the Iraq war, he is a definite outsider.</p> <h2>Henry Bellingham</h2> <p>Another longtime MP, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/dec/09/john-bercow-henry-bellingham\">if generally quite anonymous</a>, Bellingham has held his North West Norfolk seat since 1983, barring a gap between the 1997 and 2001 elections. Having had a fairly low-profile stint on the more junior parts of the frontbenches, he is perhaps best known for being related to John Bellingham, who murdered Spencer Perceval, the only UK prime minister to have been assassinated.</p> <h2>Shailesh Vara</h2> <p>Yet another outsider, the North West Cambridgeshire MP spent a dozen years on the Tory frontbench but rose only to junior levels. In mid-2018, Theresa May promoted him to second-in-command in the Northern Ireland office, but he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/15/junior-minister-resigns-amid-talk-of-challenge-to-may\">resigned a few months later</a> in protest at her Brexit plan, a departure overshadowed when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/15/dominic-raab-quits-as-brexit-secretary-over-eu-withdrawal-deal\">Dominic Raab quit the cabinet</a> almost immediately afterwards.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Lindsay Hoyle Currently the bookmakers\u2019 slight favourite over Harriet Harman, Hoyle has been the Labour MP for Chorley since 1997 and a deputy speaker since 2010. His father is Doug Hoyle, a former Labour MP who is now a peer. Hoyle, who is seen as a less contentious figure than John Bercow when in the Speaker\u2019s chair, has never declared his views on Brexit. Harriet Harman The longest-serving female MP, Harman has represented Peckham (later Camberwell and Peckham) since 1982 and spent 30 years on the Labour frontbench, including two stints as acting party leader in 2010 and 2015. She is standing as an avowed reformer who has spent decades trying to make the House of Commons a better place to work. Eleanor Laing Also a deputy speaker, Laing has been the Conservative MP for Epping Forest since 1997. Before taking the role in the Speaker\u2019s Office, she spent a dozen years filling various roles on the opposition frontbench, including a brief stint as shadow Scotland secretary. In 2009, Laing faced a confidence vote in her constituency after it emerged she had avoided paying capital gains tax on two Westminster flats. Chris Bryant The Labour MP for Rhondda\u2019s long stint on the frontbench, including as shadow culture secretary and shadow Commons leader, ended when he joined the 2016 exodus over Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership. A self-professed Commons procedure buff \u2013 he has written a two-volume history of parliament \u2013 Bryant, who has been an MP since 2001, has pledged to be a neutral Speaker who would increase the power of MPs. Meg Hillier Another Labour MP, representing Hackney South and Shoreditch since 2005, Hillier chairs of the influential public accounts committee. The former councillor and London Assembly member spent four years on the Labour frontbench, including as shadow energy secretary. Edward Leigh Almost as long serving as Harman \u2013 he has represented Gainsborough (formerly Gainsborough and Horncastle) since 1983 \u2013 Leigh is an inveterate Conservative rebel and a Brexiter of sufficiently long standing to have been sacked by John Major for voting against the Maastricht treaty. Known as an independent MP who opposed the Iraq war, he is a definite outsider. Henry Bellingham Another longtime MP, if generally quite anonymous, Bellingham has held his North West Norfolk seat since 1983, barring a gap between the 1997 and 2001 elections. Having had a fairly low-profile stint on the more junior parts of the frontbenches, he is perhaps best known for being related to John Bellingham, who murdered Spencer Perceval, the only UK prime minister to have been assassinated. Shailesh Vara Yet another outsider, the North West Cambridgeshire MP spent a dozen years on the Tory frontbench but rose only to junior levels. In mid-2018, Theresa May promoted him to second-in-command in the Northern Ireland office, but he resigned a few months later in protest at her Brexit plan, a departure overshadowed when Dominic Raab quit the cabinet almost immediately afterwards.",

      "bodyText": "Dark-green date palms stand out against the sprawling desert that descends sharply from the hills of Jerusalem to the Jordan River. To the south, the Dead Sea \u2013 the lowest place on the surface of the Earth \u2013 shimmers under an oppressive summer haze. Just a few miles north, the Palestinian city of Jericho bakes in the sun. If Benjamin Netanyahu is to be believed, this land \u2013 biblical, strategic, mythical \u2013 will soon be stripped of its status as part of Palestine. It will be declared by unilateral decree as Israel, as much as Tel Aviv or the Red Sea city of Eilat. \u201cI think Israel will do the impossible,\u201d said Hussein Atiayat, a 65-year-old Palestinian whose family have lived in the valley for generations. \u201cThe whole world is supporting him. So what can the Palestinians do?\u201d he added. \u201cWe are already destroyed: financially, spiritually, socially.\u201d The Israeli leader announced his plan in his signature dramatic fashion on Tuesday evening, standing in front of a map of the occupied West Bank and promising to extend Israeli sovereignty over large swathes of it. Netanyahu is battling for his political survival before next Tuesday\u2019s election, and the announcement was brushed off by some as a campaign stunt. But for Palestinians in the Jordan valley who have lived through half a century of military rule, his words are not to be taken lightly. \u201cI\u2019m a simple person, but my vision of what might happen is that we will be locked in our town,\u201d said Atiayat. \u201cLife will be miserable.\u201d If carried out, Netanyahu will have smashed one of the biggest taboos of the already moribund peace process. Since Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 six-day war, it has kept hold of the land under the appearance of a temporary occupation. That occupation would be turned into a delayed military conquest, a scenario that would kill off notions that Palestinians may be able to build a state alongside Israel, rather than live under some form of its rule indefinitely while unable to vote. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had this kind of opportunity since the six-day war, and may not have it again for another 50 years,\u201d Netanyahu said. As well as roughly 65,000 Palestinians, the valley is home to about 11,000 settlers whose leaders immediately applauded the prime minister\u2019s speech, calling it \u201ca historic event\u201d and \u201cunprecedented news for the state of Israel\u201d. The groundwork has already been set since Donald Trump came to power. The US president recognised Jerusalem, part of which Palestinians claim, as Israel\u2019s capital. And earlier this year, he also recognised Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, a plateau Israeli forces captured from Syria in the same 1967 conflict. Netanyahu\u2019s new plan would slice off the eastern side of the West Bank, leaving the rest encircled by Israeli territory. Coupled with a previous vow he made to annex all settlements, it would also trap Palestinians in disjointed city enclaves. Atiayat lives in the small town of Auja, just a few miles north of Jericho. Like many Palestinians, he is a refugee, displaced from his ancestral village decades ago by Israeli troops. Now he is deputy mayor of the local municipality and sits at his desk, a photo of the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat behind him. Under Netanyahu\u2019s suggestion, Auja and Jericho will not be brought into Israel but squeezed into a cutoff area, save for three roads to connect it to other Palestinian towns. Including them would have meant recognising tens of thousands of Palestinians as Israel citizens \u2013 something that horrifies many rightwingers who fear it would threaten the country\u2019s Jewish majority. \u201cIt would be better for us to live in one state. Everyone would get the same rights,\u201d Atiayat said. But Netanyahu made clear that not \u201ca single Palestinian\u201d will be granted citizenship. Some Palestinians already say they live under a quasi-annexation. Many foreign tourists on bus trips to the Dead Sea will drive right through the Palestinian territories without realising they have left the country. Road signs often display Hebrew and frequently ignore Palestinian communities, pointing out Israeli settlements instead, while many petrol stations and shops are Israeli-run. Border crossings with Jordan are controlled by Israel, which has built military bases and even national parks in the valley. For years, Palestinian farmland has been confiscated and handed to settlers, while water is diverted from Palestinian villages and people are regularly blocked from moving around. Ibrahim Qtishat, an agricultural engineer, has lived in Jericho for two decades. Last year, he rented a large farm outside Auja to plant dates. Now his land could suddenly become another country. \u201cMost of the people in this area are farmers,\u201d he said. \u201cMost will lose their jobs.\u201d Despite claims of electioneering, the Israeli prime minister\u2019s plan is clear to Qtishat. \u201cNetanyahu doesn\u2019t want to see any Palestinians. If he doesn\u2019t allow people to cultivate, they will leave.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A former police officer has escaped a prison sentence after he was caught with almost 9,000 indecent images of children. Stephen McGoldrick, 50, resigned as a PC with Gloucestershire police after he was charged with making indecent images of children. On Wednesday, McGoldrick, of Aberdare, south Wales, was sentenced to an 18-month community order with 40 days of rehabilitation and ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work. Judge Peter Blair QC, the Recorder of Bristol, also placed McGoldrick on the sex offender register for five years and made him the subject of a sexual harm prevention order for the same period. Passing sentence at Bristol crown court, the judge said: \u201cThese were abhorrent images which I believe you now acknowledge and understand have real victims. \u201cYou have fallen from grace in a massive way due to your former employment as a police officer. You have shown considerable remorse. \u201cYou must understand that I impose this sentence because I have concluded there is a good prospect of rehabilitation which can be best achieved through a community order rather than a custodial sentence. \u201cYou fall into a category where the public will be better served by this type of sentence.\u201d The court heard that images were recovered from a mobile phone belonging to McGoldrick when police were investigating a separate matter in April this year. Further inquiries were carried out and search warrants were executed at addresses in Stroud, Gloucestershire, and in Aberdare, south Wales, in June. Several electronic devices were recovered and, when they were examined, experts found a total of 8,519 indecent images \u2013 five at category A \u2013 the most serious kind. McGoldrick, who joined Gloucestershire police in 2008, was suspended and resigned before he was charged in July and pleaded guilty to five counts of making indecent images at the magistrates court last month. James Haskell, defending, said: \u201cThe convictions have already had significant consequences for him. \u201cHe knows he has forever lost his good character and is ashamed to have put his family through what he has.\u201d Haskell explained that McGoldrick had gone through significant personal difficulties in recent years, supporting his partner financially through a protracted custody battle, leading to him accruing debts of \u00a336,000. The court heard McGoldrick also struggled to deal with his partner developing cancer, the death of his elder brother and his mother\u2019s ill health. \u201cAll of this left him at almost breaking point and led him to accessing illegal pornography,\u201d Haskell said. \u201cHe knows it was wrong but was clearly in a very bad way and, in his own words, he was on a path to self-destruction.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>My finely tuned West Midlands ears pricked up this week at word of the California actress Beanie Feldstein working in a shop in Wolverhampton in order to learn the Black Country dialect. It was research for her role in the film adaptation of Caitlin Moran\u2019s How to Build a Girl. While I simply can\u2019t believe there is no British actor suitable for the role of Caitlin Moran, it\u2019s great that Feldstein is a) making the effort to do the thing properly and b) going to get the difference between the Black Country and Birmingham accents, which is not really understood anywhere more than 30 miles from, say, Cradley Heath.</p> <p>I\u2019m delighted we are going to hear words such as \u201cbostin\u2019\u201d on the big screen (if it doesn\u2019t appear in the film of Moran\u2019s book, I\u2019ll be livid, as I expect Moran would be). Bostin means great, derived, I have always assumed, from bursting, as in something so great it\u2019s bursting out of itself. The associated noun is \u201cboster\u201d, as in \u201cwhat a boster that goal was!\u201d Many moons ago, I taught English to Spanish kids in Rickmansworth, of all places. I well remember them shooting down a water slide yelling \u201cWhat a boster!\u201d at me.</p> <p>Confusingly, \u201cbost\u201d is also how you say bust or broken. When I was at university in London, a friend of mine, a Black Country blues singer and harmonica player called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yiCHWL8FA\" title=\"\">Big Jim Merris</a>, came visiting. There was an old jukebox in the union bar, which an extravagantly posh boy called Max was struggling with. Jim said to him: \u201cOh you won\u2019t get no joy out of that mate; it\u2019s bost.\u201d Max edged away from us, possibly a little frightened.</p> <p>But the key thing about Black Country speak, or spake as they say round here, isn\u2019t the accent, or even the words; it\u2019s the syntax. For example, \u201cHow are you?\u201d is expressed as \u201cHow am you?\u201d and \u201cYou are great\u201d is \u201cYou am great\u201d, which in turn is conflated to \u201cYou\u2019m great\u201d which has ended up as \u201cYam great\u201d. This is why Brummies call Black Country folk <a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=yam%20yam\" title=\"\">yam-yams</a>. As a friend of mine at West Brom pointed out once, Toys R Us in Oldbury really should have been called Toys Am We. Oh yes, as well as \u201care\u201d becoming \u201cam\u201d, \u201caren\u2019t\u201d is \u201cay\u201d. Hence something like: \u201cMe? From Birmingham? Yam joking, ay ya?\u201d</p> <p>Furthermore, instead of saying \u201cshe is\u201d, for some reason we say \u201cher is\u201d, hence something like: \u201cHer\u2019s a boster, her is.\u201d When I say \u201cwe\u201d, by the way, I don\u2019t really mean me. Although when I first came to work at the BBC I am sure they thought they had a bit of proper Black Country rough. But the truth is I would be regarded as rather posh in these parts, being raised in Hagley, which is where Brummies and Black Country folk came to live when they did well for themselves.</p> <p>To be honest, as a kid I wasn\u2019t really fully across the proper lingo. In a school football match I was somewhat aghast when a lad I was marking from the (to us) scary Grange school in Stourbridge inquired: \u201cAm yow in the district league? We am.\u201d Best not upset him, I thought.</p> <p>Anyway, I salute Moran and Feldstein for putting we (yes \u201cwe\u201d not \u201cus\u201d) on the map. We am most grateful. In fact, I have to say wim delighted; they am a right pair of bosters, an no mistake.</p> <p>\u2022 Adrian Chiles is a writer, broadcaster and Guardian columnist</p>",

For example, \u201cHow are you?\u201d is expressed as \u201cHow am you?\u201d and \u201cYou are great\u201d is \u201cYou am great\u201d, which in turn is conflated to \u201cYou\u2019m great\u201d which has ended up as \u201cYam great\u201d. This is why Brummies call Black Country folk yam-yams. As a friend of mine at West Brom pointed out once, Toys R Us in Oldbury really should have been called Toys Am We. Oh yes, as well as \u201care\u201d becoming \u201cam\u201d, \u201caren\u2019t\u201d is \u201cay\u201d. Hence something like: \u201cMe? From Birmingham? Yam joking, ay ya?\u201d Furthermore, instead of saying \u201cshe is\u201d, for some reason we say \u201cher is\u201d, hence something like: \u201cHer\u2019s a boster, her is.\u201d When I say \u201cwe\u201d, by the way, I don\u2019t really mean me. Although when I first came to work at the BBC I am sure they thought they had a bit of proper Black Country rough. But the truth is I would be regarded as rather posh in these parts, being raised in Hagley, which is where Brummies and Black Country folk came to live when they did well for themselves. To be honest, as a kid I wasn\u2019t really fully across the proper lingo. In a school football match I was somewhat aghast when a lad I was marking from the (to us) scary Grange school in Stourbridge inquired: \u201cAm yow in the district league? We am.\u201d Best not upset him, I thought. Anyway, I salute Moran and Feldstein for putting we (yes \u201cwe\u201d not \u201cus\u201d) on the map. We am most grateful. In fact, I have to say wim delighted; they am a right pair of bosters, an no mistake. \u2022 Adrian Chiles is a writer, broadcaster and Guardian columnist",

Fiercer and more frequent hurricanes will batter us, and millions of people who live in areas where crops have failed and wells run dry will be forced to flee their homes. But walls will not work with the climate crisis, even if the temptation to try to keep out the consequences, rather than dealing with the causes, is as strong as ever.</p> \n<p>The prospect of a \u201cclimate apartheid\u201d, in which the rich insulate themselves from the impacts of the climate emergency while the poor and vulnerable are abandoned to their fate, is now real. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/07/one-climate-crisis-disaster-happening-every-week-un-warns\" title=\"\">According to the UN</a>, climate-related disasters are already taking place at the rate of one a week, though only a few of them \u2013 such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/10/hurricane-dorian-bahamas-death-toll-devastation-latest\" title=\"\">Hurricane Dorian</a> \u2013 get reported.</p> \n<p>Nowhere on Earth will be untouched, with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/19/water-shortages-could-affect-5bn-people-by-2050-un-report-warns\" title=\"\">number of people facing water shortages</a> set to leap from 3.6 billion today to 5 billion by 2050. At least <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/climatechange/overview\" title=\"\">100 million people will be plunged into poverty</a> in the next decade, and in the decades following that, rising sea levels will swamp coastal cities from Miami to Shanghai, wiping <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/us/unnecessary-us-emissions-to-cause-1trn-damage-to-global-economy-1.3845988\" title=\"\">$1tn a year</a> from the global economy. Agriculture will become increasingly difficult, with more people displaced as a result, searching for liveable conditions elsewhere.</p> \n<p>The Global Commission on Adaptation, headed by Bill Gates and Ban Ki-moon, <a href=\"https://time.com/5672435/climate-change-adaptation/\" title=\"\">warned this week</a> that we have failed to plan adequately for a crisis that is now upon us. At a series of high-level meetings beginning in the next few weeks, and continuing into next year, world leaders and representatives of civil society and businesses will try to devise a better response. Among the questions they face will be how to set new targets, secure new funding and take more effective action to help the world not just prevent further warming, but to adapt to the impacts already being felt.</p> \n<p>Currently, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/10/climate-crisis-world-readiness-effects-gravely-insufficient-report\" title=\"\">20 times more</a> is being spent on reducing emissions than building resilience to the effects of rising temperatures and extreme weather, according to the Commission on Adaptation. That seems patently unbalanced, and neglecting adaptation is putting millions of people and their livelihoods in danger now, as well as storing up problems for the future.</p> \n<p>What\u2019s more, money invested today will pay dividends in the near future. Spending less than $2tn by 2030 would result in more than $7tn saved in damage avoided and better economic growth. These sums sound huge, but are a fraction of the amount the world will spend on infrastructure in the next decade.</p> \n<p>And modern adaptation means more than building seawalls. Restoring natural features, such as mangrove swamps and wetlands, can do far more to protect coastal regions, as well as nurturing biodiversity and tourism. New technology will play a key role, as early warnings of extreme weather give people time to take shelter or protect their property. Engineering climate-ready infrastructure encompasses everything from porous pavements to urban trees to provide shade.</p> \n<p>What\u2019s clear is that we need to adapt and build resilience now, because climate change is no longer a comfortably faraway problem. The predicted ravages have come sooner than expected: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jul/24/why-is-europe-going-through-a-heatwave\" title=\"\">heatwaves</a> over much of the northern hemisphere last year, floods and extreme weather in south-east Asia, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/07/oceans-demise-the-end-of-the-arctic-as-we-know-it\" title=\"\">Arctic ice melting</a> at unprecedented levels this summer, and Hurricane Dorian, one of the strongest ever recorded. Worse still, some of these effects are likely themselves to increase temperatures further, in a series of feedback loops. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/09/amazon-fires-brazil-rainforest\" title=\"\">fires in the Amazon</a> are destroying a vital \u201ccarbon sink\u201d. Shrinking ice reveals darker water that absorbs more heat than highly reflective snow. Melting permafrost releases methane, a greenhouse gas many times more powerful than carbon dioxide.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"be04a33c-0106-421f-b857-06abb5b3a391\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wnUWCEhw7_k?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>It is tempting, in the face of these events, to suggest that the game is up for trying to prevent climate change. The emissions reductions needed to stop it are so vast, and the changes to our way of life so total, that it may seem like all we can do is adapt to the consequences. The hastening prospect of a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/25/climate-apartheid-united-nations-expert-says-human-rights-may-not-survive-crisis\" title=\"\">climate apartheid</a>\u201d is morally revolting as well as politically alarming, and could lead to a kind of paralysis.</p> \n<p>The view that adapting to inevitable climate change should be our priority, over futile and ruinously expensive attempts to cut emissions, has been spread by those who want to continue to emit CO<sub>2</sub>, come what may.

      "bodyText": "When we\u2019re faced with threats of inundation, our reaction has traditionally been to build walls. Sea-level rises, storms and floods have been held back with solid barriers, seawalls and dykes. We have used walls to keep out people, too: the fact that this has failed throughout the ages has not stopped its recent revival in the United States. The climate crisis threatens global sea-level rises of well over half a metre if we fail to act, while tidal storm surges will reach many times that height. Fiercer and more frequent hurricanes will batter us, and millions of people who live in areas where crops have failed and wells run dry will be forced to flee their homes. But walls will not work with the climate crisis, even if the temptation to try to keep out the consequences, rather than dealing with the causes, is as strong as ever. The prospect of a \u201cclimate apartheid\u201d, in which the rich insulate themselves from the impacts of the climate emergency while the poor and vulnerable are abandoned to their fate, is now real. According to the UN, climate-related disasters are already taking place at the rate of one a week, though only a few of them \u2013 such as Hurricane Dorian \u2013 get reported. Nowhere on Earth will be untouched, with the number of people facing water shortages set to leap from 3.6 billion today to 5 billion by 2050. At least 100 million people will be plunged into poverty in the next decade, and in the decades following that, rising sea levels will swamp coastal cities from Miami to Shanghai, wiping $1tn a year from the global economy. Agriculture will become increasingly difficult, with more people displaced as a result, searching for liveable conditions elsewhere. The Global Commission on Adaptation, headed by Bill Gates and Ban Ki-moon, warned this week that we have failed to plan adequately for a crisis that is now upon us. At a series of high-level meetings beginning in the next few weeks, and continuing into next year, world leaders and representatives of civil society and businesses will try to devise a better response. Among the questions they face will be how to set new targets, secure new funding and take more effective action to help the world not just prevent further warming, but to adapt to the impacts already being felt. Currently, 20 times more is being spent on reducing emissions than building resilience to the effects of rising temperatures and extreme weather, according to the Commission on Adaptation. That seems patently unbalanced, and neglecting adaptation is putting millions of people and their livelihoods in danger now, as well as storing up problems for the future. What\u2019s more, money invested today will pay dividends in the near future. Spending less than $2tn by 2030 would result in more than $7tn saved in damage avoided and better economic growth. These sums sound huge, but are a fraction of the amount the world will spend on infrastructure in the next decade. And modern adaptation means more than building seawalls. Restoring natural features, such as mangrove swamps and wetlands, can do far more to protect coastal regions, as well as nurturing biodiversity and tourism. New technology will play a key role, as early warnings of extreme weather give people time to take shelter or protect their property. Engineering climate-ready infrastructure encompasses everything from porous pavements to urban trees to provide shade. What\u2019s clear is that we need to adapt and build resilience now, because climate change is no longer a comfortably faraway problem. The predicted ravages have come sooner than expected: heatwaves over much of the northern hemisphere last year, floods and extreme weather in south-east Asia, Arctic ice melting at unprecedented levels this summer, and Hurricane Dorian, one of the strongest ever recorded. Worse still, some of these effects are likely themselves to increase temperatures further, in a series of feedback loops. The fires in the Amazon are destroying a vital \u201ccarbon sink\u201d. Shrinking ice reveals darker water that absorbs more heat than highly reflective snow. Melting permafrost releases methane, a greenhouse gas many times more powerful than carbon dioxide. It is tempting, in the face of these events, to suggest that the game is up for trying to prevent climate change. The emissions reductions needed to stop it are so vast, and the changes to our way of life so total, that it may seem like all we can do is adapt to the consequences. The hastening prospect of a \u201cclimate apartheid\u201d is morally revolting as well as politically alarming, and could lead to a kind of paralysis. The view that adapting to inevitable climate change should be our priority, over futile and ruinously expensive attempts to cut emissions, has been spread by those who want to continue to emit CO2, come what may. Fossil fuel companies saw adaptation, along with the idea that we could geo-engineer our way out of trouble, as a way to keep selling oil while paying lip service to the climate science. Now it is gaining traction among more respectable thinkers. Jonathan Franzen, the American novelist and nature lover, whipped up a storm when he suggested in the New Yorker that: \u201cIn the long run, it probably makes no difference how badly we overshoot 2C \u2026 Every billion dollars spent on high-speed trains \u2026 is a billion not banked for disaster preparedness, reparations to inundated countries, or future humanitarian relief.\u201d It\u2019s true that spending on adaptation is a good deal.

If Ana is a proxy for electronica\u2019s female groundbreakers, Collin doesn\u2019t \u2013 beyond a couple of vaguely sleazy hangers-on with boundary issues \u2013 flesh out the kind of opposition, both on gender and aesthetic grounds, they faced. Which means the character can\u2019t really function as a metaphor for the current generation of women looking, post-MeToo, for their own new wave. Jodorowsky, shut in with her machines, gives a nicely tamped-down performance, but doesn\u2019t have much to grip. The music\u2019s fabulous, but the film is not fully awhirl \u2013 like Mia Hansen-L\u00f8ve\u2019s Eden \u2013 with the sweep of the times. \u2022 The Shock of the Future is released in the UK on 13 September.",

No thanks. Secondly, LSE is all-in on the Refinitiv deal so why would they pull out now for such a gamble? It doesn\u2019t make sense.

David Madden of CMC Markets says optimism over the US-China trade war, and hopes of a new European Central Bank (ECB) stimulus package have boosted sentiment. China said it will not impose additional tariffs on 16 US products, and this conciliatory move should help the trading relationship between Washington DC and Beijing. Tomorrow, the ECB will hold their much awaited meeting, and the chatter about an interest rate cut, and possibly the announcement of a bond buying scheme too has encouraged the buying of equities. Nathan Flanders, Global Head of Non-Bank Financial Institutions at Fitch Ratings, thinks a Hong Kong Exchange-London Stock Exchange merger could make sense: It could come with near-term integration and deleveraging risks, but would result in more highly diversified platforms over the longer-term, better positioned to compete in an increasingly consolidated industry where scale and data are expected to drive outperformance.\u201d Over in Canary Wharf, a small army of celebrities have been trading stocks, shares, swaps and currencies today, to raise funds for charity. It\u2019s the 15th annual BGC Charity Day, created to commemorate the 658 BGC colleagues and the 61 Eurobrokers employees who died in the World Trade Center attacks on 9/11. Prince Harry has led the way, helping to close a \u00a31bn trade in UK government debt, or gilts, amid plenty of noise from enthusiastic traders (just remember that yields move inversely to prices, your highness, and you\u2019ll be fine). The organisers hope to raise around \u00a39m for a wide group of charities, making it one of the City\u2019s major fund-raising events. Here\u2019s some photos from the event: A Hong Kong takeover bid for the London Stock Exchange could be a fine test of the government\u2019s commitment to being open for business, while also protecting national assets from predators. With excellent timing, business secretary Andrea Leadsom was live on Bloomberg when the news broke. She (understandably) wasn\u2019t briefed on the deal, but said: We\u2019re always keen to see foreign direct investment, and collaboration with different international interests. But we\u2019d have to look very carefully at anything that potentially had security implications for the United Kingdom. Last year the UK strengthened its Takeover Code, forcing bidders to disclose more details of their plans. That followed the controversial takeover of chocolate group Cadbury by US food giant Kraft in 2009. But this didn\u2019t stop investment firm Melrose snapping up manufacturing group GKN.... nor did it stop Melrose shutting a factory a year later in a \u201cbreach of faith\u201d. Our US Politics Live blog is covering Donald Trump\u2019s latest attack on the US Federal Reserve: The Telegraph\u2019s Ben Marlow makes a good point -- Brexit uncertainty has left UK assets vulnerable to foreign takeovers. He writes: The timing of a blockbuster bid for the London Stock Exchange from its Hong Kong counterpart could not be worse for a Government desperate to reposition itself as the pre-eminent global free trading hub. The City will be pivotal to any such attempt to build a thriving economy outside of the European Union and the LSE is the beating heart of the Square Mile. Yet the irony of the EU referendum is that it has turned UK companies into sitting ducks. The pound is at record lows, stock prices have tanked, and debt has never been cheaper, paving the way for any overseas investor with even modest aspirations to pick off targets at will. Blue-chip firms have been falling like dominoes. He also thinks that government should be \u201ccrawling all over\u201d the proposal, given the risk that China tightens its control of Hong Kong. More here: Here\u2019s Mark Sweney\u2019s news story on the potential merger of the Hong Kong and London stock markets: Predictably, Sports Direct\u2019s annual general meeting today turned into the usual farce. The UK-listed company refused to let journalists into the room where the thermostat was cranked suspiciously high, almost as if they wanted it over quickly. The main even was over in 20 minutes, while protests against SPD\u2019s management took place outside. But boss Mike Ashley did at least talk about the situation at the company: The shock demand for \u00a3600m in unpaid taxes from Belgium also came up.... Will Howlett, research analyst at Quilter Cheviot, suspects a bidding war could now break out for the London Stock Exchange... \u201cThe Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing offer is equivalent to c. 8,361p per share and would represent a multiple of c. 37x on consensus 2020 earnings, which is a significant premium to the exchanges sector, typically trading on a multiple of 20-30x. This is an elevated multiple but we still believe there is a possibility that rivals may express an interest with the LSE seemingly \u2018in play\u2019. \u201cThis proposed offer would disrupt LSE\u2019s offer for Refinitiv, which we view as an attractive combination delivering high levels of earnings accretion, creating an industry leading market infrastructure provider, increasing recurring revenues and the exposure to higher growth in the US and emerging markets. While HKEX\u2019s offer for LSE is attractive, we believe there are more limited synergies available on the deal \u2013 reflecting the lack of overlap between the two businesses with HKEX focusing on Hong Kong and the London Metals Exchange, both areas of limited exposure for the LSE. Getting back to the LSE-HKEX merger proposal... and Neil Wilson of Markets.com has written an excellent explanation of why it won\u2019t happen. He argues that the British government won\u2019t want to see the London Stock Exchange effectively in Beijing\u2019s hands: The UK government may not wish to see such a vital symbol of UK financial services strength, and indeed a strategic asset, to be owned by foreigners; effectively it would hand it over to the Chinese through the Hong Kong back door. For the time being at least the EU also has a say in this. The US will also be eyeing this very, very closely indeed and not liking much at all. Shareholders in the LSE might not fancy the deal either, he suggests... Nut and bolts - there\u2019s not a mammoth premium here and do you as a LSE shareholder now fancy ditching your LSE stock in favour of a Hong Kong listed share (just 41% of the new company to boot) which at any moment could be appropriated by Beijing should they so desire? No thanks. Secondly, LSE is all-in on the Refinitiv deal so why would they pull out now for such a gamble? It doesn\u2019t make sense. I guess the question now is whether this approach forces others to join the party and spark a bidding war. Not everyone is so warm to the Refinitiv deal as the stock price adjustment suggests - a better premium from say a (US) rival could look appealing to shareholders. Newsflash: Donald Trump has accused America\u2019s top bankers of being \u201cboneheads\u201d for not cutting interest rates. In the latest of a series of attacks on the Fed, Trump claims that America\u2019s interest rates should be zero -- allowing it to refinance its debts. In July the Fed cut its overnight lending rate to 2.25% -- much higher than the zero in the eurozone, or the UK\u2019s 0.75%. America can currently borrow at around 1.7% per annum for 10 years, compared to 0.66% for the UK. Thanks to negative bond rates, Germany gets paid 0.5% per year when it issues a 10-year bund. The London Stock Exchange is no stranger to merger excitement. It has made three separate attempts to merge with its German rival, Deutsche Bourse, in the last 15 years. The latest attempt was dramatically blocked by EU competition authorities in 2017. Paul Corren of London law firm Wedlake Bell, says: It is not entirely a surprise that the London Stock Exchange Group is subject to a merger offer. The LSE Group\u2019s share price has been relatively strong year to date and HKEX see this as an opportunity to anchor the London and Hong Kong global financial centres and create a global market infrastructure leader.\u201d Richard Hunter, Head of Markets at interactive investor, says a merger between London and Hong Kong\u2019s stock exchanges would be \u201ctotemic\u201d -- and could also make strategic sense. However.... he also believes there are some serious hurdles: The scale of the deal is one which approximately results in the two exchanges being a merger of equals. The London Stock Exchange has historically fought off approaches from overseas, preferring instead to be the acquirer. It may also be that the likes of the New York Stock Exchange will be looking on with interest. In addition, the very nature of the Hong Kong approach will be subject to any number of considerations, such as competitive and regulatory issues. This is quite apart from the political questions it raises, both in terms of the history between the two \u201ccountries\u201d, as well as how an East-West tie-up might be seen in the eyes of the United States, given the current economic situation. Part of the proposal requires that the Stock Exchange back away from its recent $27 billion deal to acquire Refinitiv, which appears to be an early stumbling block. The initial response from the Stock Exchange, which describes the approach as \u201cunsolicited, preliminary and highly conditional\u201d, is one which it will consider. The proposal is a fascinating prospect, but far from a done deal. The fact that the LSE share price has already retreated from the initial 10% spike on release of the news may reflect some initial scepticism around the likelihood of the deal going through.\u201d Here\u2019s some instant media reaction to the HKEX-LSE merger proposal. Julianna Tatelbaum of CNBC calls it \u2018huge\u2019 news, with serious ramifications: CNBC\u2019s Joumanna Bercetche says it would help Hong Kong to win stock market business: Bloomberg\u2019s Benjamin Robertson calls it a bold move -- but will the LSE\u2019s shareholders really reject its planned merger with data group Refinitiv (which it\u2019s buying from Blackstone)? Bloomberg\u2019s Sarah Syed tweets: The LSE\u2019s shares are dropping back, as traders digest HKEX\u2019s offer. They\u2019re now just 6% higher at \u00a372.60, a long way shy of the 22% premium which its Hong Kong rival is offering. Newsflash: The London Stock Exchange has issued a rather cagey response to HKEX\u2019s approach, calling it \u201cunsolicited, preliminary and highly conditional\u201d. The LSE also insists that it remains committed to its merger with data firm Refinitiv -- which would turn it into a new challenger to Bloomberg. But, the LSE hasn\u2019t rejected HKEX\u2019s approach out of hand. Instead, it will consider it and then respond. Here\u2019s the statement: The Board of London Stock Exchange Group plc (\u201cLSEG\u201d) notes the announcement from Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (\u201cHKEX\u201d) and confirms that HKEX has made an unsolicited, preliminary and highly conditional proposal to acquire the entire share capital of LSEG (the \u201cProposal\u201d). The Board of LSEG will consider this Proposal and will make a further announcement in due course. LSEG remains committed to and continues to make good progress on its proposed acquisition of Refinitiv Holdings Ltd as announced on 1 August 2019. A circular is expected to be posted to LSEG shareholders in November 2019 to seek their approval of the transaction. Here\u2019s our news story on the surprise battle for the London Stock Exchange: This is the second time in three weeks that a Hong Kong group has tried to merge with a UK company. Last month, Hong Kong\u2019s richest man, Li Ka-shing, won control of pub chain Greene King in a \u00a34.6bn deal. Such takeovers are made easier by the weakness of the pound, which is down 16% since the EU referendum in 2016. Graham Spooner, investment research analyst at The Share Centre, explains: \u201cFollowing on closely on the heels of the bid for Greene King from Hong Kong\u2019s wealthiest person comes a bid approach for The London Stock Exchange from The Hong Kong Exchange, with the latter stating this would create a world leading market infrastructure group. Shares are up 9% on the news with investors offered 2,045 pence in cash along with 2.495 in HK Exchange shares. \u201cThe LSE\u2019s share price has been strong year to date and there have been thoughts the group could be a target again especially following the proposed merger with Deutsche Boerse which fell through in 2017. So although there is much uncertainty surrounding the UK some investors may benefit in the short-term from increased corporate activity.\u201d Laura Cha, chairman of HKEX, says her company have had \u201cearly engagement\u201d with the London Stock Exchange about the proposal. However, there\u2019s no official response from the LSE yet - suggesting that engagement might not have been very friendly. Cha says: \u201cWe believe a combination of HKEX and LSEG represents a highly compelling strategic opportunity to create a global market infrastructure group, bringing together the largest and most significant financial centres in Asia and Europe. Following early engagement with LSEG, we look forward to working in detail with the LSEG Board to demonstrate that this transaction is in the best interests of all stakeholders, investors and both businesses.\u201d Shares in the London Stock Exchange have surged to a new alltime high. Shares jumped 16% to \u00a378.94, after Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing surprised the City with its move on the LSE. That values the LSE at around \u00a327.6bn. That\u2019s someway below today\u2019s proposal, which is a 22% premium to last night\u2019s closing share price. HKEX is offering \u00a329.6bn, but the proposal is actually worth \u00a331.6bn once you include the debt it would take on (the \u2018enterprise value\u2019). This suggests the City isn\u2019t convinced this deal will go through..... NEWSFLASH: Hong Kong\u2019s stock exchange has launched an audacious attempt to merge with the London Stock Exchange. Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited is proposing to pay \u00a329.6bn in cash and shares for the LSE. It says that the merger would strengthen both businesses, and help them to offer new trading services across the globe. It could help London pitch services to Chinese customer, and also \u201creinforce\u201d Hong Kong\u2019s position as the gateway to mainland China (which has been threatened by recent protest, of course). As HKEX puts it, it will: Create a world-leading market infrastructure group with a global footprint, diversified across asset class, ideally positioned to benefit from the evolving global macroeconomic landscape, connecting the established financial markets in the West with the emerging financial markets in the East, particularly in China. The offer comes just five weeks after the LSE announced its own deal - a surprise merger with data group Refinitiv (part of Thomson Reuters). HKEX is now trying to crash the party -- saying its proposal (which isn\u2019t a full-blown takeover bid yet), is dependent on the Refinitiv deal collapsing or being rejected. More to follow.... China has taken steps to de-escalate the trade war with America, by removing tariffs from 16 types of US goods. Beijing\u2019s State Council announced that the items, including some chemicals, anti-cancer drugs and lubricant oils, will be exempt from its latest tariffs for a year. However, some major US products such as soybeans were not included on the list, meaning Chinese importers must still pay a tariff. This move has cheered investors, who have driven European shares to six-week highs today. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says China\u2019s move has raised hopes of a breakthrough when officials meet in Washington next month. At the very least it suggests a willingness to engage seriously in these talks. Nevertheless I think we remain a long way and even a presidential election away from a deal. On this note, economics professor Barry Eichengreen argues that America\u2019s central bankers must warn that the trade war is hurting the US economy: The \u201crelentless sell-off in global bond markets\u201d shows little sign of abating just yet, warns Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank. He points to a headline yesterday, suggesting that the European Central Bank might delay launching a new quantitative easing (bond-buying) package. However, he adds: The headlines got the market excited but a closer read suggested that the base case from the main source in the article was that QE was still likely to be announced. Investors are going to be on edge until tomorrow lunchtime, when the ECB announces its decisions. Germany\u2019s 30-year bond yield has burst back into positive territory! The 30-year bund is swapping hands at 0.033% this morning, having fallen below zero last month. That means Berlin can still borrow very cheaply, but will have to pay some interest to its lenders. And as with the rise in UK bond yields, it follows signs that government borrowing could be rising. Government sources have revealed plans for a possible \u2018shadow budget\u2019, which would allow new debt to be issued by public agencies. This would circumvent the rules which ban Germany\u2019s government from running a deficit. The big worry is that the rise in bond yields will leave some investors with unpleasant losses. At the end of August, the amount of debt trading at negative yields surged to $17 trillion, an all-time record. But in recent days, this has dropped back to $15 trillion. Because yields move inversely to prices, this means anyone who bought bonds at their recent peaks is now facing capital losses. If they bought at negative yields, they won\u2019t get any coupon (interest) payments either! Britain\u2019s sovereign debt is also under pressure this morning, sending yields up to six-week highs. The yield on UK 10-year gilts jumped to 0.666% this morning, up from a low of just 0.339% a week ago. That means it would cost the UK government more to borrow for a decade - although it\u2019s still cheap in historic terms. UK bond yields have been creeping up since chancellor Sajid Javid announced the biggest new spending plans in 15 years. Bond traders may have concluded that Britain will breach its deficit targets, and borrow more money to balance the books. Here\u2019s Mohamed El-Erian of Allianz on the latest bond moves: Marketwatch\u2019s Sunny Oh reckons bond traders are worried that Mario Draghi might disappoint them tomorrow, at his final meeting as ECB president. Investors are looking ahead to the European Central bank rate decision on Thursday, where it is expected to announce stimulus measures. Push back by some ECB policy makers on the case for further easing, however, has dampened hopes that the central bank will an ambitious stimulus package. ECB President Mario Draghi has insisted it still has policy tools available amid questions that the central bank has run out of ammunition, but analysts say it\u2019s not clear if monetary policy can boost economic growth in a world where debt yields are already negative. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. For months there\u2019s been a simple mantra in the bond market: What goes up keeps on going up. Nervous investors have driven sovereign bond prices to a series of record highs, as they have looked for a safe place for their money. This move has pushed bond yields (the rate of return on the debt) to record lows. As a result, many European governments have bee able to borrow at negative interest rates, with investors even willing to pay Berlin for the privilege of buying Germany\u2019s 30-year debt. But nothing last for ever. And this week, bond prices have started to turn south, pushing bond yields higher. Overnight, the yields on America\u2019s two-year and 10-year bonds have hit one-month highs, bouncing back from their lowest levels since 2016. That move means prices are falling, suggesting weaker demand. The move came after a US Treasury auction of three-year bonds proved disappointing. So what\u2019s going on? The optimistic view is that investors are growing less nervous, and are churning their money out of bonds into other assets, which might give a better rate of return. With a no-deal Brexit on 31 October looking unlikely, and fresh US-China trade talks imminent, the global economy could perk up. That would make low-yielding bonds look less attractive. As Reuters puts it: Hopes of diminishing U.S.-China tensions and reduced risk of no-deal Brexit have prompted investors to take profit in risk-off trade ahead of key central bank policy meetings. The pessimistic view is that investors have simply got carried away in recent months and driven bond prices ridiculously high. Many had been counting on central bankers to launch big new stimulus packages to spur growth. But those hopes may prove misplaced -- if European Central Bank (which meets tomorrow) and the US Federal Reserve disappoint investors. As Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, explains: The downside correction in global sovereign markets continue in the final run-up to the ECB and Federal Reserve meetings this week and the next respectively. Investors are trimming long speculative positions in sovereign bonds, as dovish expectations have certainly gone well ahead of what central banks would deliver at his month\u2019s meetings. As such, the US 10-year yield recovered past the 1.70% mark, and the 10-year bund retreated past -0.55%. Also coming up today Troubled retailer Sports Direct is holding its Annual General Meeting. It\u2019s a chance for shareholders to ask pertinent questions such as \u201cWhat\u2019s gone wrong with the House of Fraser takeover, Mike?\u201d. Boss Mike Ashley has, alas, banned journalists from attending -- but he\u2019s been known to revoke this red card at the last minute, so the hacks might yet squeeze in. Fashion chain SuperDry is also holding its AGM - the first since founder Julian Dunkerton won his battle to rejoin the board in April (the rest of the board responded by resigning en masse...) The economic diary is quiet, beyond new US oil inventory data. The agenda 10.30am BST: Superdry AGM 11am BST: Sports Direct AGM 3.30pm BST: US weekly oil inventories",

      "bodyText": "The UK government\u2019s announcement of its plans to offer extended post-study work visas for international graduates of UK universities has received an unusual response \u2013unalloyed praise from the higher education sector. The decision reverses one of the most contentious policies from Theresa May\u2019s time in charge of immigration policy, which shrank the time available for overseas students to stay and work after graduating from two years to as little as four months in most cases. For vice-chancellors gathering for the Universities UK annual conference in Birmingham this week, the reversal was greeted as a victory after seven years of lobbying for a more relaxed stance, allowing Britain to compete more effectively against the likes of Canada in attracting students. \u201cA piece of good news for a change!\u201d tweeted Shearer West, the vice-chancellor of the University of Nottingham, echoing the thoughts of her peers across the country. Interest groups, including the CBI and the Campaign for Science and Engineering (Case), were also quick to applaud the announcement. \u201cThis is terrific news,\u201d said Sarah Main, Case\u2019s executive director. \u201cHaving had a meagre offer for the last seven years, the UK has just returned to an internationally competitive offer for undergraduate and postgraduate students. Some of the UK\u2019s biggest companies talk of the \u2018war for talent\u2019 in areas such as AI. The UK has just raised its game.\u201d Last year, about 180,000 international students graduated from British universities with about 6,000 moving on to skilled work visas. Paul Blomfield, the Labour MP who co-chairs the all-party parliamentary group for international students, also said he was delighted by the change, for which his group has repeatedly called since 2012. \u201cThe next step would be to remove barriers in visa application processes and in particular to review the credibility interviews which allow Home Office staff to block applications on the basis of questions which no UK student could be expected to answer,\u201d said Blomfield. But Blomfield, Main and others called for more detail about how the new regime would operate. Rather than allowing graduates to stay as of right, as Canada does, the new \u201cimmigration route\u201d would require graduates to apply again for the extra two years. If they did find permanent work in that time they would need to apply for a further visa to stay. The announcement was reported widely in India, where there has been a steep fall in the number of international students coming to the UK since the two-year post-study allowance was ended. In 2010-11, when May described the two-year period as \u201ctoo generous\u201d, there were more than 50,000 Indian international students in he UK. But applications slumped after the new rule and other changes were brought in. Last year, there were just 22,000 students from India after strenuous efforts by the UK government and universities to increase recruitment. Sir Dominic Asquith, the British high commissioner to India, said: \u201cThis exciting announcement will help ensure that the UK remains one of the best destinations for students across the world.\u201d The government said it planned to introduce the change next year for graduates holding tier 4 general student visas, giving universities time to crank up their marketing campaigns. But current students say that it is unfair that they should have to miss out. Matt Mottaghian, an international student completing a masters degree at the University of Lancaster, said he had to go to great lengths to apply for an entrepreneurship visa in order to stay in the UK. \u201cOffering this only to students from next year makes current students in the country feel even more abandoned,\u201d Mottaghian said. \u201cI truly believe that fairness tells us that such law should apply to all current students too, which will then make them a huge success for the British economy.\u201d YouGov released a snap poll of 2,000 British adults that showed support for the change. Forty-six per cent said they were in favour of the extension to two years while 26% were opposed, and 28% said they did not know. Support was strongest among Labour and Lib Dem voters, while Conservative supporters were split, with 37% for and 35% against.",

Trudeau, who swept to office in November 2015 promising \u201csunny ways\u201d and stressing the importance of gender equality and the environment, faces an electorate which will be much more focused on the economy. The country\u2019s 43rd election also comes against the backdrop of protracted political scandal for the incumbent prime minister. For months, Trudeau has faced accusations \u2013 including from the country\u2019s ethics commissioner \u2013 that he acted improperly when he requested his attorney general to halt criminal prosecution of the Quebec-based engineering giant SNC Lavalin. Trudeau and his Liberals are widely expected to use the election to shore up support for his government\u2019s climate change policies, including a nationwide carbon tax. His main opponent, the Conservative leader, Andrew Scheer, has pledged to repeal the Liberals\u2019 marquee environmental legislation.

David was appointed a circuit judge in 1992 and was the honorary recorder of Manchester from 2003 until 2008, when he was appointed to the high court (Queen\u2019s bench division). He retired in 2012, but continued to sit at first instance and in the court of appeal until 2017. He was on the Parole Board from 1996 to 2002, and was director of criminal training at the Judicial Studies Board (now the Judicial College) from 2010 to 2013, where he was the first, and so far only, lecturer to receive a 100% approval rating from the notoriously difficult-to-please delegates. In 2014, in order to mark his contribution, he became the college\u2019s first honorary fellow. Away from the law he played the piano and enjoyed tennis, and was accomplished at both. He was also a keen golfer. His greatest love, however, was Liverpool football club, at which he was a season ticket holder. He is survived by Indira, by his sons, Graeme, Simon and me, and by five grandchildren.",

Ellen Judd, who chairs the Afghanistan committee of the September Eleventh Families for Peaceful Tomorrows and lost her partner in the attack, said she supported the withdrawal of US troops. \u201cI think it would be great if the troops were withdrawn. While we certainly want that, there is so much more involved in the peace process,\u201d she said. But some said they felt the timing of the canceled weekend talks could have been better. \u201cI\u2019m all for some kind of negotiated peace to bring our guys and gals back home,\u201d said retired firefighter Lee Ielpi. But, he said, \u201cit has to be the correct type of peace where the Taliban and al-Qaida are told point-blank \u2026 any violation at all will be dealt with swiftly and with a lot of strength.\u201d The reactions came as the president drew criticism for posting a photograph of himself with the first lady, Melania Trump, their backs to the camera, with the caption: \u201cWe Will Never Forget.\u201d \u201cExcept when we invite the Taliban over for a photo op,\u201d George Conway fired back on Twitter. Conway is a sharp critic of Trump and also husband to the White House aide Kellyanne Conway. The 18th anniversary commemorations also came shortly after a date was finally set for the trial of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged mastermind of the 9/11 terror attacks, at the US military base in Guant\u00e1namo Bay on 11 January 2021. Mohammed is charged with 2,976 counts of murder and related charges. Evidence will be presented to a jury composed of military officers at a court compound called Camp Justice and presided over by Col Shane Cohen of the US air force. Meanwhile, as commemorations got under way, dedications to fallen firefighters continue to be erected, marking the names of those who have died in the years following 9/11 from exposure to toxins while working on rescue and then recovery at Ground Zero. Last week, a plaque to firefighter John Elges, who died from cancer caused by Ground Zero toxins, was readied for the Queens borough firehouse where he served. Workers and others in and around Ground Zero after the twin towers fell down and the wreckage burned for weeks have also been sickened or have died.",

The pair talked about the Rugby World Cup, which South Africa was hosting the following year, and the role the sport could play in helping to unify a nation after the divisiveness of apartheid.</p> <p>Williams, a wing who rose to the top more through willpower and dedication than innate ability, became the poster boy of the 1995 World Cup, although a hamstring injury he sustained in the build-up against Western Samoa meant he was initially left out of the South Africa squad. He was called up for the knock-out stage after Pieter Hendriks was suspended following a fight during the final group game against Canada. Williams faced the Samoans again, scoring four of his side\u2019s six tries in a 42-14 victory, kept his place in the semi-final against France and, the only non-white player in the squad, played in the final against New Zealand at Ellis Park in Johannesburg which the hosts won with a Joel Stransky drop goal in extra time.</p> <p>Williams\u2019s image had been used on billboards to promote the tournament, but he was uncomfortable at presenting what he felt was a facade. He revealed in his autobiography, Chester (2002), that he was later racially abused during a provincial match by his team-mate on the other wing in the final, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/48940831\" title=\"\">James Small</a>. \u201cThe marketing men branded me as a product of development and a sign of change,\u201d said Williams in 2002, two years after he retired from playing. \u201cNothing could have been more of a lie. I wasn\u2019t a pioneer.\u201d</p> <p>He came from a family of pioneers, however. He inherited his love of rugby from his father, Wilfred Williams, who played for the Proteas, a team run by the South Africa Rugby Federation for black and \u201ccoloured\u201d players that divided opinion in those communities because it had an inter-race fixture list; a versatile back, Williams Sr played against the 1974 British Lions in Cape Town and against France the following year. An uncle, Adam Donbas, the brother of Chester\u2019s mother, Julene, captained the side in 1971.</p> <p>As soon as he could walk, Chester was taken by his father to watch him in training and when he was 17, the pair appeared together in a match for the local club Albions. Wilfred announced his retirement in the changing room afterwards, saying that when you appeared in the same team as your son, it was time to go.</p> <p>The Proteas outside-half against the 1974 Lions was Errol Tobias; seven years later he became the first black player to be capped by South Africa. He was followed in 1984 by Avril Williams, another uncle of Chester\u2019s, who played in both the Tests on England\u2019s tour; the third black international player, in 1993, was Chester himself. He scored a try on his debut against Argentina and dedicated his jersey to his father.</p> <p>\u201cI tried to idolise my dad and I dreamed of being a Springbok, even though in those days it was almost impossible to become one,\u201d he recalled in 2015. \u201cI kept on dreaming and through hard work and persistence I got the opportunity. I never really had the talent, but I wanted to achieve.\u201d</p> <p>Williams was born in Paarl in the Western Cape. He went to Klein Nederburg secondary school and captained the first XV there after his interest in rugby was rekindled by his uncle Avril playing for the Springboks. He served in the navy for two years before joining the army and played alongside Avril for the Defence club. He made his debut for Eastern Province in 1991, the first of 68 appearances, which included two Currie Cup finals, and became such a popular figure there that it was suggested the side\u2019s ground, Newlands, should be renamed Chesterfield.</p> <p>He then joined the Lions super rugby team and finished his career in 2000 with the Cats, as the Lions were then known. He won 27 caps, scoring 14 tries, and his coaching career from 2001 took in Uganda, Tunisia and Romania as well as the South Africa Sevens team, the Cats and the Pumas. This year he released his own beer label, Chester\u2019s Lager and Chester\u2019s IPA, which will be the only South African brew at the upcoming Rugby World Cup in Japan.</p> <p>After meeting Mandela in 1994, Williams began an enduring friendship with the president: Mandela became godfather to his twin children, and the family continued to see Mandela in his final years when few were allowed access. \u201cOne of his mantras was, \u2018It always seems impossible until it\u2019s done,\u2019\u201d said Williams, after Mandela\u2019s death in 2013. \u201cHe made us live that out on the pitch.\u201d</p> <p>He is survived by his wife, Maria (nee Robson), whom he married in 2002, by two children, Chloe and Matthew, and a stepson, Ryan, and by his father, a sister and a brother.</p> <p>\u2022 Chester Mornay Williams, rugby player and coach, born 8 August 1970; died 6 September 2019</p>",

He served in the navy for two years before joining the army and played alongside Avril for the Defence club. He made his debut for Eastern Province in 1991, the first of 68 appearances, which included two Currie Cup finals, and became such a popular figure there that it was suggested the side\u2019s ground, Newlands, should be renamed Chesterfield. He then joined the Lions super rugby team and finished his career in 2000 with the Cats, as the Lions were then known. He won 27 caps, scoring 14 tries, and his coaching career from 2001 took in Uganda, Tunisia and Romania as well as the South Africa Sevens team, the Cats and the Pumas. This year he released his own beer label, Chester\u2019s Lager and Chester\u2019s IPA, which will be the only South African brew at the upcoming Rugby World Cup in Japan. After meeting Mandela in 1994, Williams began an enduring friendship with the president: Mandela became godfather to his twin children, and the family continued to see Mandela in his final years when few were allowed access. \u201cOne of his mantras was, \u2018It always seems impossible until it\u2019s done,\u2019\u201d said Williams, after Mandela\u2019s death in 2013. \u201cHe made us live that out on the pitch.\u201d He is survived by his wife, Maria (nee Robson), whom he married in 2002, by two children, Chloe and Matthew, and a stepson, Ryan, and by his father, a sister and a brother. \u2022 Chester Mornay Williams, rugby player and coach, born 8 August 1970; died 6 September 2019",

      "bodyText": "International students at British universities are to be allowed to stay in the UK for two years after graduating, compared with four months currently. What is the government proposing? Students will need to hold a tier 4 student visa and have successfully completed a degree from a trusted UK university or higher education provider with a proven track record in upholding immigration checks and other rules on studying in the UK. There will be no limit on the number of students who can apply for the new graduate route. Those on the scheme will be able to switch to the skilled work route if they find a job that meets the skill requirement of the route. How many international students come to the UK? Last year, British universities educated about 460,000 international students, not including those from the EU. The government aims to increase the number to 600,000 over the next 10 years. What was the previous policy? Currently, graduates with bachelor\u2019s or master\u2019s degrees are allowed to look for work for only four months. The government\u2019s immigration white paper proposed to extend this period to six months \u2013 so the new scheme goes further. The current policy was introduced by the then home secretary, Theresa May, in 2012. She said the two-year post-study work visa was \u201ctoo generous\u201d and tightened the rules amid a push to meet the government\u2019s target of reducing net migration to the tens of thousands \u2013 a goal never met by May as home secretary or prime minister.

There has been a push from the business and education sectors to relax the rules for international students. This was supported in recent years by several former and current cabinet members, including the former home secretary Sajid Javid.

How has the change to the policy been received? The announcement was greeted with enthusiasm by the education sector and business, which is braced for a fall in the number of students and prospective employees from the EU when freedom of movement comes to an end after Brexit. Alistair Jarvis, the chief executive of Universities UK, said the previous visa regime put the UK at a \u201ccompetitive disadvantage\u201d in recruiting international students. \u201cThe introduction of a two-year post-study work visa is something Universities UK has long campaigned for and we strongly welcome this policy change, which will put us back where we belong as a first-choice study destination,\u201d he said. \u201cNot only will a wide range of employers now benefit from access to talented graduates from around the world, these students hold lifelong links with the UK.\u201d Jasmine Whitbread, the chief executive of London First, a pro-business campaign group, said: \u201cUniversities and businesses alike will welcome this commonsense move, which will ensure that we retain global brainpower.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>When I was writing about the dinners I had with my elderly friend Edward, I made a decision early on not to include any recipes. Edward, an accomplished cook, rarely wrote down any instructions for, say, his oysters Rockefeller or chicken <em>paillard</em>. While the food we ate was certainly important, the book was not meant to be a cookbook, but instead a memoir about the nature of friendship.</p> <p>In this pursuit, I was inspired by a rich literature of culinary writing in which food is a central motif, but is held together by the story of its preparation and the fellowship that comes from sharing a meal. So many writers \u2013 from MFK Fisher, who wrote lyrically about the pleasures of dining alone, to New York chef Gabrielle Hamilton, who documented her hardscrabble upbringing through family meals \u2013 use food as a catalyst for memories and loving nostalgia.</p> <p>While I\u2019m still a big fan of a good recipe book \u2013 anything by Jamie Oliver, Yotam Ottolenghi and Julia Child \u2013 it\u2019s the stories in beautifully rendered memoirs that stay with me longer than any recipe. It\u2019s Nigel Slater using burnt toast as a metaphor for his mother\u2019s love, and Anne Fadiman getting drunk as a teenager when she tries to please her vintage-wine-obsessed father. Below, are what I consider some of the best culinary memoirs.</p> <p><strong>1. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/22/books/review/wine-lovers-daughter-anne-fadiman-memoir.html\">The Wine Lover\u2019s Daughter: A Memoir by Anne Fadiman</a><br></strong>Fadiman\u2019s most recent book about her father, the American author and radio personality Clifton Fadiman, is a deftly written memoir \u2013 a coming-of-age story written around her father\u2019s oenophilia. He was \u201ca lousy driver and a two-finger typist\u201d, she writes, \u201cbut he could open a wine bottle as deftly as any swain ever undressed his lover\u201d.</p> <p><strong>2. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/beb90a4c-408f-11e7-82b6-896b95f30f58\">The Gastronomical Me by MFK Fisher</a><br></strong>Mary Frances Kennedy Fisher was ahead of her time. After spending \u201ctwo shaking and making years in my life\u201d with her new husband in Dijon, she returned to California in the early 1940s where she became a serious food writer. The Gastronomical Me recounts some of her very poetic encounters with food. Here was a woman who loved nothing more than dining alone in a restaurant \u201cas if I were a guest of myself, to be treated with infinite courtesy.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bc66199f8e70cf645d1a036ece7b29579ba633f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc66199f8e70cf645d1a036ece7b29579ba633f6/0_277_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"MFK Fisher at home in 1971.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">MFK Fisher at home in 1971.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Drew/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>3. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/apr/17/gabrielle-hamilton-blood-bones-butter\">Blood, Bones and Butter: The Inadvertent Education of a Reluctant Chef by Gabrielle Hamilton</a></strong><br>Hamilton runs Prune, a jewel of a restaurant in New York\u2019s East Village. She is also a gifted writer who takes you on a journey from her difficult adolescence in rural Pennsylvania to New York\u2019s aptly named neighbourhood Hell\u2019s Kitchen, where she moves after high school before opening her restaurant.</p> <p><strong>4. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/21/laurie-colwin-home-cooking-review\">Home Cooking: A Writer in the Kitchen by Laurie Colwin</a><br></strong>The New Yorker writer and Gourmet magazine columnist\u2019s memoir is about the joys of cooking at home. From her tiny Greenwich Village kitchen, she writes about meals shared with friends and family. \u201cI love to eat out, but even more, I love to eat in,\u201d she says. I fell for the ordinary extraordinariness of her stories, the reliance on available resources and implements to create something wonderful. This is what I tried so hard to capture in my own book.</p> <p><strong>5. <a href=\"https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/private/love-among-the-molluscs/\">Consider the Oyster by MFK Fisher</a></strong><br>WH Auden called Fisher \u201cAmerica\u2019s greatest writer\u201d, which is my excuse for choosing a second book by her. It\u2019s easy to see why the poet so admired her, in this slim 1941 volume \u2013 an ode to the gastronome\u2019s prize treat. \u201cAn oyster leads a dreadful but exciting life,\u201d she begins. Fisher tells you everything you ever wanted to know about this bivalve mollusc and writes brilliantly about such unfamiliar ingredients as <a href=\"https://imbibemagazine.com/Elements-Herbsaint/\">Herbsaint</a>.</p> <p><strong>6. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/28/books/review/28riding.html\">My Life in France by Julia Child, with Alex Prud\u2019homme</a></strong><br>A great account of the Childs\u2019 life in Paris after the second world war. Working with her grandnephew Alex Prud\u2019homme, the great chef reminisces about meeting her husband Paul in what was still Ceylon while both were working for the Office of Strategic Services, the precursor to the CIA. When Paul took a job in Paris, Julia immersed herself in French cooking. Her description of eating sole <em>meuni\u00e8re</em> for the first time at a restaurant in Rouen is mouth-watering: \u201cIt arrived whole: a large, flat Dover sole that was perfectly browned in a sputtering butter sauce with a sprinkling of chopped parsley on top.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e367c8b66ba764320ecece737321d804a12d61e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e367c8b66ba764320ecece737321d804a12d61e9/0_13_2412_1447/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Julia Child in her home in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Julia Child in her home in Cambridge, Massachusetts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rick Friedman/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>7. <a href=\"https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-393-05196-4\">Cooking for Mr Latte: A Food Lover\u2019s Courtship With Recipes by Amanda Hesser</a><br></strong>The \u201cMr Latte\u201d of the title is the author\u2019s boyfriend, a writer for the highbrow New Yorker who has rather lowbrow tastes in food. Although affable and intelligent, he ends each exquisite meal they share with the fine-dining faux pas of a latte. First told in instalments for the New York Times where Hesser worked as a food writer, this is as much a love letter to New York and food as it is to the man Hesser ends up marrying.</p> <p><strong>8. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/books/titles/138108737/more-home-cooking-a-writer-returns-to-the-kitchen\">More Home Cooking: A Writer Returns to the Kitchen by Laurie Colwin</a></strong><br>Since the subject here concerns appetite, I\u2019m going to recommend a second helping of Colwin. I feel a real kinship to her because I share her obsession with what people eat at home. Written the year Colwin died aged just 50, this is a treatise on the importance of the family dinner \u2013 no matter who you consider to be family. \u201cWe know that without food we would die,\u201d she writes. \u201cWithout fellowship life is not worth living.\u201d</p> <p><strong>9. <a href=\"http://gailsimmons.com/book-1\">Talking With My Mouth Full: My Life as a Professional Eater by Gail Simmons</a></strong><br>Simmons is a presenter/judge on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/dec/01/top-chef-in-praise-of-season-14-bravo\">Bravo\u2019s Top Chef</a>, but she\u2019s also a fellow Canadian who found herself struggling to make it in a tough industry in New York. In this memoir, she writes about growing up in Toronto with a mother who wrote food columns and conducted cooking classes in their suburban home. Simmons\u2019s trial-by-fire in some of the toughest high-end restaurant kitchens in New York City makes for a great read.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/11/top-10-books-about-self-reinvention\">Top 10 books about self-reinvention</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>10. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/toast-9781841154718.html\">Toast: The Story of a Boy\u2019s Hunger by Nigel Slater</a><br></strong>Slater tells the story of his childhood through a catalogue of British sweets \u2013 fairy drops and Bluebird milk chocolate toffees \u2013 and the culinary failures of his mother.

The Wine Lover\u2019s Daughter: A Memoir by Anne Fadiman Fadiman\u2019s most recent book about her father, the American author and radio personality Clifton Fadiman, is a deftly written memoir \u2013 a coming-of-age story written around her father\u2019s oenophilia. He was \u201ca lousy driver and a two-finger typist\u201d, she writes, \u201cbut he could open a wine bottle as deftly as any swain ever undressed his lover\u201d. 2. The Gastronomical Me by MFK Fisher Mary Frances Kennedy Fisher was ahead of her time. After spending \u201ctwo shaking and making years in my life\u201d with her new husband in Dijon, she returned to California in the early 1940s where she became a serious food writer. The Gastronomical Me recounts some of her very poetic encounters with food. Here was a woman who loved nothing more than dining alone in a restaurant \u201cas if I were a guest of myself, to be treated with infinite courtesy.\u201d 3. Blood, Bones and Butter: The Inadvertent Education of a Reluctant Chef by Gabrielle Hamilton Hamilton runs Prune, a jewel of a restaurant in New York\u2019s East Village. She is also a gifted writer who takes you on a journey from her difficult adolescence in rural Pennsylvania to New York\u2019s aptly named neighbourhood Hell\u2019s Kitchen, where she moves after high school before opening her restaurant. 4. Home Cooking: A Writer in the Kitchen by Laurie Colwin The New Yorker writer and Gourmet magazine columnist\u2019s memoir is about the joys of cooking at home. From her tiny Greenwich Village kitchen, she writes about meals shared with friends and family. \u201cI love to eat out, but even more, I love to eat in,\u201d she says. I fell for the ordinary extraordinariness of her stories, the reliance on available resources and implements to create something wonderful. This is what I tried so hard to capture in my own book. 5. Consider the Oyster by MFK Fisher WH Auden called Fisher \u201cAmerica\u2019s greatest writer\u201d, which is my excuse for choosing a second book by her. It\u2019s easy to see why the poet so admired her, in this slim 1941 volume \u2013 an ode to the gastronome\u2019s prize treat. \u201cAn oyster leads a dreadful but exciting life,\u201d she begins. Fisher tells you everything you ever wanted to know about this bivalve mollusc and writes brilliantly about such unfamiliar ingredients as Herbsaint. 6. My Life in France by Julia Child, with Alex Prud\u2019homme A great account of the Childs\u2019 life in Paris after the second world war. Working with her grandnephew Alex Prud\u2019homme, the great chef reminisces about meeting her husband Paul in what was still Ceylon while both were working for the Office of Strategic Services, the precursor to the CIA. When Paul took a job in Paris, Julia immersed herself in French cooking. Her description of eating sole meuni\u00e8re for the first time at a restaurant in Rouen is mouth-watering: \u201cIt arrived whole: a large, flat Dover sole that was perfectly browned in a sputtering butter sauce with a sprinkling of chopped parsley on top.\u201d 7. Cooking for Mr Latte: A Food Lover\u2019s Courtship With Recipes by Amanda Hesser The \u201cMr Latte\u201d of the title is the author\u2019s boyfriend, a writer for the highbrow New Yorker who has rather lowbrow tastes in food. Although affable and intelligent, he ends each exquisite meal they share with the fine-dining faux pas of a latte. First told in instalments for the New York Times where Hesser worked as a food writer, this is as much a love letter to New York and food as it is to the man Hesser ends up marrying. 8. More Home Cooking: A Writer Returns to the Kitchen by Laurie Colwin Since the subject here concerns appetite, I\u2019m going to recommend a second helping of Colwin. I feel a real kinship to her because I share her obsession with what people eat at home. Written the year Colwin died aged just 50, this is a treatise on the importance of the family dinner \u2013 no matter who you consider to be family. \u201cWe know that without food we would die,\u201d she writes. \u201cWithout fellowship life is not worth living.\u201d 9. Talking With My Mouth Full: My Life as a Professional Eater by Gail Simmons Simmons is a presenter/judge on Bravo\u2019s Top Chef, but she\u2019s also a fellow Canadian who found herself struggling to make it in a tough industry in New York. In this memoir, she writes about growing up in Toronto with a mother who wrote food columns and conducted cooking classes in their suburban home. Simmons\u2019s trial-by-fire in some of the toughest high-end restaurant kitchens in New York City makes for a great read. 10. Toast: The Story of a Boy\u2019s Hunger by Nigel Slater Slater tells the story of his childhood through a catalogue of British sweets \u2013 fairy drops and Bluebird milk chocolate toffees \u2013 and the culinary failures of his mother. Burnt toast was her specialty. \u201cMy mother burns the toast as surely as the sun rises each morning,\u201d writes Slater, who nevertheless longs for blackened bread after she dies and his father marries a woman who is the perfect housewife but very much the evil stepmother. \u2022 Dinner With Edward: A Story of an Unexpected Friendship by Isabel Vincent is published by Pushkin.

      "bodyText": "On the roadmap to post-Brexit Britain, Boris Johnson offering overseas students more time to find a job in the country after they graduate attempts to hit on a compromise: between the demands of business to attract workers and the demands of many Brexit voters for migration to fall. Economic considerations appear to have won out. Universities had been applying significant pressure, warning that Theresa May\u2019s tougher rules would inflict severe damage on a sector where Britain is a genuine world leader. Businesses argued that graduates would head elsewhere, to fill roles from low-skilled retail jobs to high-flying finance and tech startups. According to the lobby group Universities UK, enticing the 460,000 overseas students to Britain \u2013 including 140,000 from the EU \u2013 supports almost a million jobs and brings in \u00a326bn a year for the economy. Under the market-driven changes introduced by the coalition government, some universities have become dependent on the higher fees paid by international students. The government reckons education exports also provide an important economic contribution, generating around \u00a320bn in 2016. About \u00a31.8bn is raked in from awarding UK degrees in other countries \u2013 a rise of 73% since 2010. May\u2019s tough stance made little sense when her own trade ministers wanted to increase overseas student numbers to as many as 600,000 by 2030. Britain also taps into soft power from hosting migrant students that is difficult to quantify. A British degree is a mark of distinction. About 60 heads of government and state around the world were educated in Britain, and not just at Oxbridge: four studied at Manchester, while others went to Bristol, Brentford and Cardiff. Opening up the country to student migration could also be key for new trade deals, including with nations such as India, which sends significantly fewer students to Britain than China does. . Johnson has been aided by softening attitudes on migration since the Brexit vote, as the economic and cultural benefits have been spelled out in greater detail. The Migration Advisory Committee put paid to the notion that EU migrants drive down wages, drive up crime, bleed the welfare state dry and rob British jobs. In contradiction to the tabloid rhetoric, Oxford Economics reckons EU migrants contribute about \u00a32,300 more to the public purse each year than the average adult. There are some potential drawbacks. Britain has a higher proportion of graduates in non-graduate jobs than average for a wealthy nation, while a third of migrant workers in the UK are also overqualified for their jobs. However, overseas students typically forge lasting ties that stick with them throughout their careers. Ministers will hope the visa extension strengthens those bonds, supporting the economy, when Brexit might otherwise damage them.",

She studied economics at the universities of G\u00f6ttingen and M\u00fcnster before attending the London School of Economics where she used the pseudonym Rose Ladson because she was seen as a potential target for West German leftwing extremists.</p>\n    <p>Von der Leyen then read for a medical degree, becoming a gynaecologist, and only entered politics at 42. A mother of seven, she has held government positions as labour and family affairs minister, driving forward key policies on gender quotas for company boards and improved maternity and paternity pay and rights \u2013 policies that initially won her considerable popularity.</p>\n    <p>In 2011, Von der Leyen spoke of her desire for a \u201cUnited States of Europe along the lines of federal states like Switzerland,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany\">Germany</a>&nbsp;or the US\u201d. She has since claimed that Brexit, and the loss of the \u201cpragmatism\u201d of the British in the EU, should propel the bloc towards further integration, and has voiced support for a European army.</p>\n    <p>She is a key ally of Angela Merkel, with whom she has worked since 2005. Like Merkel, she has championed the idea of a close relationship between the EU and UK after Brexit.<br></p>\n    <p>Von der Leyen, though, has been withering about those who campaigned for Brexit, Describing events since the referendum as a \u201cburst bubble of hollow promises \u2026 inflated by populists\u201d. She has cautioned that a no-deal Brexit would be the \u201cworst possible start\u201d to the close long-term EU-UK relationship that Berlin holds desirable.</p>\n    <p>The nicknames she has acquired over the course of her 29-year career in German politics tell their own story. During her time in charge of the family ministry, she was first called&nbsp;<em>Krippen-Ursel</em>&nbsp;(\u201ccr\u00e8che Ursel\u201d), a conservative closet feminist set on expanding nursery places, and then&nbsp;<em>Zensursula</em>, a control freak who wanted to shield German youth from the dark sides of the internet.</p>\n    <p>When she became Germany\u2019s first female defence minister in 2013, her (mostly male) detractors referred to her as&nbsp;<em>Flinten-Uschi&nbsp;</em>(\u201cshotgun Uschi\u201d), a caricature of the bossy career woman.</p>\n    <p>As commission president, Von der Leyen will represent the EU on the world stage, and a key task will be building a working relationship with Donald Trump\u2019s White House. She has previously criticised a lack of strategy in Trump\u2019s approach to Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia and has suggested the US president\u2019s frosty relationship with Merkel is based on his outdated view of women.</p>\n    <p><b>Daniel Boffey</b> <i>in Brussels </i>and <b>Philip Oltermann </b><i>in Berlin</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The British Labour MEP Claude Moraes, a former chair of the European parliament\u2019s justice and home affairs committee, said the title could not stand. \u201cCalling the European commission migration portfolio \u2018protecting our way of life\u2019 is deeply insulting,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Speaking to the Guardian, Moraes said he and his fellow Socialist MEPs were \u201cvery upset and alarmed\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere was absolute, complete condemnation,\u201d he said, speaking after a group meeting on Wednesday. \u201cIf that [title] survives then we are in a bad position as progressives, because it is an embarrassment for us.\u201d</p> \n<p>Sophie in \u2018t Veld, a Dutch liberal MEP who works on migration law, said the decision was misguided and urged Von der Leyen to withdraw the title. \u201cThe very point about the European way of life is the freedom for individuals to choose their own way of life,\u201d she said. </p> \n<p>\u201cWe do not need a commissioner for that, thank you very much.

Marcelino has been replaced by the former Spain Under-21s manager Albert Celades, after a crisis that has been growing steadily over the last year and was played out publicly during the summer finally exploded on Wednesday. Valencia face Barcelona at the Camp Nou on Saturday night before travelling to London.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/11/england-kosovo-euro-2020-the-fiver\">The Fiver | A man who had just fallen backwards down a water chute with a beer in both hands</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lim summonsed the club\u2019s president, Anil Murthy, to Singapore in order to fire the manager. Marcelino did not know about the meeting until reports appeared in the media on Wednesday morning and the official announcement was made in the afternoon. The club\u2019s director general, Mateu Alemany, remains in his post for the time being, although his long\u2011term position appears untenable. The players are understood to be shocked by the decision, but they knew that this was likely sooner or later.</p> <p>Marcelino has been credited with bringing stability back to Valencia, a club with a propensity for infighting and crisis. He led them to a Champions League place last season and to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/25/barcelona-valencia-copa-del-rey-final-match-report\" title=\"\">a Copa del Rey final victory</a> over Barcelona in Seville \u2013 their first trophy for 11 years, and in their centenary season. But his relationship with the club\u2019s owner had become unbearably strained. That was not helped by the very fact that he and Alemany were seen as the architects of the success, rather than the owner \u2013 or in spite of the owner, in fact.</p> <p>Lim bought Valencia five years ago, and has signed 52 players since.

      "bodyText": "Chelsea\u2019s Champions League opponents Valencia have been thrown into chaos after the club\u2019s owner, Peter Lim, announced the sacking of Marcelino Garc\u00eda Toral six days before their visit to Stamford Bridge. Marcelino has been replaced by the former Spain Under-21s manager Albert Celades, after a crisis that has been growing steadily over the last year and was played out publicly during the summer finally exploded on Wednesday. Valencia face Barcelona at the Camp Nou on Saturday night before travelling to London. Lim summonsed the club\u2019s president, Anil Murthy, to Singapore in order to fire the manager. Marcelino did not know about the meeting until reports appeared in the media on Wednesday morning and the official announcement was made in the afternoon. The club\u2019s director general, Mateu Alemany, remains in his post for the time being, although his long\u2011term position appears untenable. The players are understood to be shocked by the decision, but they knew that this was likely sooner or later. Marcelino has been credited with bringing stability back to Valencia, a club with a propensity for infighting and crisis. He led them to a Champions League place last season and to a Copa del Rey final victory over Barcelona in Seville \u2013 their first trophy for 11 years, and in their centenary season. But his relationship with the club\u2019s owner had become unbearably strained. That was not helped by the very fact that he and Alemany were seen as the architects of the success, rather than the owner \u2013 or in spite of the owner, in fact. Lim bought Valencia five years ago, and has signed 52 players since. Celades will be his eighth manager, with Salvador Gonz\u00e1lez \u201cVoro\u201d having had three different spells in charge. Questions have been raised over Lim\u2019s motives for owning the club and his commitment from Singapore as well as the role played by the agent Jorge Mendes. Marcelino arrived in July 2017, employed by Alemany, who had joined the club in March that year. Murthy took over as president in July. It was a significant turnaround for Valencia. A new structure appeared to be set up with Alemany and Marcelino constructing the squad and tranquillity at last. But over the last few months a barely concealed battle for control had become evident, with an open breakdown in relations between manager, general manager and owner.

      "body": "<p>Boris Johnson is under intense pressure to recall parliament following the Scottish ruling that prorogation was unlawful, with MPs branding his refusal to do so authoritarian and an affront to democracy.</p> \n<p>Labour, the SNP and Lib Dems all demanded an urgent recall of parliament to allow scrutiny of the government\u2019s Brexit plans, after Scottish appeal court judges ruled against Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament in the run-up to the October Brexit deadline.</p> \n<p>The prime minister was facing outrage and the prospect of more protests, as No 10 made clear that parliament would not be reinstated unless Johnson was ordered to do so at appeal.</p> \n<p>The three judges, chaired by Lord Carloway, Scotland\u2019s most senior judge, overturned an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/04/boris-johnsons-prorogation-of-parliament-is-lawful-scottish-court-rules\">earlier ruling</a> that the courts did not have the power to interfere in the prime minister\u2019s political decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/09/boris-johnson-to-prorogue-parliament-on-monday-night\">prorogue parliament</a>.</p> \n<p>Lawyers acting for 75 opposition MPs and peers argued Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament for five weeks was illegal and in breach of the constitution, as it was designed to stifle parliamentary debate and action on Brexit.</p> \n<p>The judges failed to issue an interdict, or injunction, ordering the UK government to reconvene parliament, prompting a row over whether the decision meant MPs could go back to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/houseofcommons\">House of Commons</a>.</p> \n<p>Downing Street said it was not under any obligation to bring parliament back into session following the Scottish ruling but added that the government would be bound by the judgment of the supreme court. \u201cAs a matter of fact, parliament remains prorogued,\u201d a No 10 spokesman said.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday evening the MPs and peers involved in the Scottish court action attempted to intensify pressure on the government to reconvene parliament.</p> \n<p>Their law firm, Balfour &amp; Manson, wrote to the UK government to insist that the court\u2019s decision meant \u201cthe legal position is that parliament is not prorogued and is still in session. Any argument that parliament is \u2018in practice\u2019 prorogued is thus spurious.\u201d</p> \n<p>Amid fury that Johnson was effectively ignoring a Scottish court\u2019s judgement, Downing Street also became embroiled in a row about whether a No 10 source had briefed anonymously against Scottish judges, implying that campaigners had chosen a court in Edinburgh because of political bias.</p> \n<p>The source told the Sun: \u201cWe note that last week the high court in London did not rule that prorogation was unlawful. The legal activists choose the Scottish courts for a reason.\u201d</p> \n<p>The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman hit back at the idea that Johnson\u2019s administration was in any way attacking Scottish judges, saying: \u201cAbsolutely not, we have absolute respect for the independence of the judiciary.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cThere are now contradictory judgments in the English and Scottish courts, and the matter will be considered by the supreme court next week,\u201d he added.<br><br>However, the damage had been done, as opposition parties seized on the briefing. The SNP released an advert saying: \u201cSources at No 10 have responded by questioning the political neutrality of the Scottish judges. The Tories at Westminster are effectively saying: Scottish democracy must be ignored. Scots Law must be ignored.\u201d</p> \n<p>Also later in the day Kwasi Kwarteng, the junior business minister, appeared to reignite the row when he said it would be \u201can extraordinary development\u201d for the supreme court to uphold the Scottish ruling, adding that there was a risk people could believe the judges were politically motivated.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat I would say is that the more the courts get involved in politics, that is a detriment not only to politics but also to courts,\u201d he told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil Show. \u201cBecause many people are saying \u2013 I\u2019m not saying this \u2013 that the judges are biased, that the judges are getting involved in politics. I\u2019m just saying what people are saying.\u201d</p> \n<p>Downing Street was also facing accusations that Johnson had misled the Queen by advising her that prorogation was legal.</p> \n<p>With tensions rising, Dominic Grieve, the former Tory cabinet minister, who had the whip withdrawn by Johnson last week, said the prime minister must resign if it turns out that he had given her the wrong advice. \u201cBoris Johnson will find himself in an untenable position in parliament ... every member that believes in our constitution would simply say, it\u2019s over,\u201d he told the BBC.</p> \n<p>Pressed on whether the PM lied to the Queen about the reasoning behind the prorogation, Johnson\u2019s spokesman referred journalists to the arguments laid out by the government\u2019s lawyers during the court cases.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe answer on why parliament has been prorogued is unchanged. As we\u2019ve said, the current parliamentary session is the longest parliamentary session in almost 400 years. In recent months it\u2019s been one of the least active. The PM said on his first day in the job that the time has come to act, to take decisions, to give strong leadership and to change this country for the better. He wants to put before MPs a proper domestic legislative programme. This will be a Queen\u2019s speech focused on helping the NHS, fighting violent crime and cutting the cost of living.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ian Blackford, the SNP leader in Westminster, demanded that Johnson listen to the Scottish court and told him to \u201cabide by the rule of law\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cEvery day that parliament remains suspended, you and the UK government are shutting down democracy,\u201d he wrote in a letter to the prime minister.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"cae146af-d709-44dc-a1b4-7231dceca18c\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/akM2iMOcUUA?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, also urged Johnson to \u201copen those doors\u201d so that MPs can hold the prime minister to account.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is really important. The idea of shutting down parliament offended people across the country and then they felt they weren\u2019t being told the truth,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think that what I need to do, and what others need to do, is to get back to parliament and open those doors and get back in, and get Boris Johnson back in parliament so we can hold him properly to account.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Lib Dems also called for parliament to be restored. Tom Brake, the Lib Dem Brexit spokesman, accused Johnson of authoritarianism and \u201ctrampling on the very values and principles the United Kingdom was founded upon\u201d.<br></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a6e3847f-f534-48fa-9919-609e4c49cad2\" data-atom-type=\"timeline\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Timeline\">\n    <p><i>(August 24, 2019)</i>&nbsp;<strong> The story breaks</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Observer breaks the story that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/24/johnson-seeks-legal-advice-parliament-closure\">Boris Johnson has sought legal advice on closing parliament for five weeks</a>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(August 27, 2019)</i>&nbsp;<strong>Leaks spread</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Other media organisations begin to receive leaks that Johnson will make a statement on prorogation</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(August 28, 2019)</i>&nbsp;<strong>Visit to Balmoral</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Three privy counsellors, including Jacob Rees-Mogg, travel to Balmoral to tell the Queen of the prorogation plan.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson is under intense pressure to recall parliament following the Scottish ruling that prorogation was unlawful, with MPs branding his refusal to do so authoritarian and an affront to democracy. Labour, the SNP and Lib Dems all demanded an urgent recall of parliament to allow scrutiny of the government\u2019s Brexit plans, after Scottish appeal court judges ruled against Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament in the run-up to the October Brexit deadline. The prime minister was facing outrage and the prospect of more protests, as No 10 made clear that parliament would not be reinstated unless Johnson was ordered to do so at appeal. The three judges, chaired by Lord Carloway, Scotland\u2019s most senior judge, overturned an earlier ruling that the courts did not have the power to interfere in the prime minister\u2019s political decision to prorogue parliament. Lawyers acting for 75 opposition MPs and peers argued Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament for five weeks was illegal and in breach of the constitution, as it was designed to stifle parliamentary debate and action on Brexit. The judges failed to issue an interdict, or injunction, ordering the UK government to reconvene parliament, prompting a row over whether the decision meant MPs could go back to the House of Commons. Downing Street said it was not under any obligation to bring parliament back into session following the Scottish ruling but added that the government would be bound by the judgment of the supreme court. \u201cAs a matter of fact, parliament remains prorogued,\u201d a No 10 spokesman said. On Wednesday evening the MPs and peers involved in the Scottish court action attempted to intensify pressure on the government to reconvene parliament. Their law firm, Balfour &amp; Manson, wrote to the UK government to insist that the court\u2019s decision meant \u201cthe legal position is that parliament is not prorogued and is still in session. Any argument that parliament is \u2018in practice\u2019 prorogued is thus spurious.\u201d Amid fury that Johnson was effectively ignoring a Scottish court\u2019s judgement, Downing Street also became embroiled in a row about whether a No 10 source had briefed anonymously against Scottish judges, implying that campaigners had chosen a court in Edinburgh because of political bias. The source told the Sun: \u201cWe note that last week the high court in London did not rule that prorogation was unlawful. The legal activists choose the Scottish courts for a reason.\u201d The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman hit back at the idea that Johnson\u2019s administration was in any way attacking Scottish judges, saying: \u201cAbsolutely not, we have absolute respect for the independence of the judiciary.\u201d \u201cThere are now contradictory judgments in the English and Scottish courts, and the matter will be considered by the supreme court next week,\u201d he added. However, the damage had been done, as opposition parties seized on the briefing. The SNP released an advert saying: \u201cSources at No 10 have responded by questioning the political neutrality of the Scottish judges. The Tories at Westminster are effectively saying: Scottish democracy must be ignored. Scots Law must be ignored.\u201d Also later in the day Kwasi Kwarteng, the junior business minister, appeared to reignite the row when he said it would be \u201can extraordinary development\u201d for the supreme court to uphold the Scottish ruling, adding that there was a risk people could believe the judges were politically motivated. \u201cWhat I would say is that the more the courts get involved in politics, that is a detriment not only to politics but also to courts,\u201d he told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil Show. \u201cBecause many people are saying \u2013 I\u2019m not saying this \u2013 that the judges are biased, that the judges are getting involved in politics. I\u2019m just saying what people are saying.\u201d Downing Street was also facing accusations that Johnson had misled the Queen by advising her that prorogation was legal. With tensions rising, Dominic Grieve, the former Tory cabinet minister, who had the whip withdrawn by Johnson last week, said the prime minister must resign if it turns out that he had given her the wrong advice. \u201cBoris Johnson will find himself in an untenable position in parliament ... every member that believes in our constitution would simply say, it\u2019s over,\u201d he told the BBC. Pressed on whether the PM lied to the Queen about the reasoning behind the prorogation, Johnson\u2019s spokesman referred journalists to the arguments laid out by the government\u2019s lawyers during the court cases. \u201cThe answer on why parliament has been prorogued is unchanged. As we\u2019ve said, the current parliamentary session is the longest parliamentary session in almost 400 years. In recent months it\u2019s been one of the least active. The PM said on his first day in the job that the time has come to act, to take decisions, to give strong leadership and to change this country for the better. He wants to put before MPs a proper domestic legislative programme. This will be a Queen\u2019s speech focused on helping the NHS, fighting violent crime and cutting the cost of living.\u201d Ian Blackford, the SNP leader in Westminster, demanded that Johnson listen to the Scottish court and told him to \u201cabide by the rule of law\u201d. \u201cEvery day that parliament remains suspended, you and the UK government are shutting down democracy,\u201d he wrote in a letter to the prime minister. Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, also urged Johnson to \u201copen those doors\u201d so that MPs can hold the prime minister to account. \u201cThis is really important. The idea of shutting down parliament offended people across the country and then they felt they weren\u2019t being told the truth,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that what I need to do, and what others need to do, is to get back to parliament and open those doors and get back in, and get Boris Johnson back in parliament so we can hold him properly to account.\u201d The Lib Dems also called for parliament to be restored. Tom Brake, the Lib Dem Brexit spokesman, accused Johnson of authoritarianism and \u201ctrampling on the very values and principles the United Kingdom was founded upon\u201d. Some Labour MPs \u2013 including some of those who took part in Monday night\u2019s rowdy late-night scenes in the House of Commons \u2013 urged Jeremy Corbyn to issue a three-line whip to summon them back to Westminster. Clive Lewis said: \u201cI am going to be discussing this with others; but there is an argument that that judgment now stands, and that the prorogation is illegal; and until it\u2019s challenged and a new judgment is made in a higher court, the prorogation has no legal basis. \u201cThere is an argument for MPs to rock up and start taking back control of the agenda \u2013 and start going through the Yellowhammer documents, and everything else that we have asked for.\u201d He suggested Corbyn could \u201cinitiate a three-line whip\u201d, to recall colleagues. About 40 MPs returned to work in parliament on Wednesday in protest at its suspension and to show their support for the Scottish ruling. The chair of the Commons\u2019 Brexit select committee, Labour\u2019s Hilary Benn, the Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, and Labour\u2019s Meg Hillier, who is standing to replace John Bercow as Speaker, were among those at a gathering outside Westminster and said they will continue to work throughout the suspension, even though they cannot hold any debates or speak in the Commons\u2019 chamber. Swinson said: \u201cThis is really unprecedented what\u2019s happening to our democracy. It\u2019s positive the court has ruled today that this is unlawful. There is one reason why Boris Johnson has prorogued parliament and that is because he wants to force through his no-deal Brexit without having scrutiny, without having to obey the normal rules that a prime minister has to obey by.\u201d She said any suggestion the judges in the Scottish court case were politically biased was \u201cappalling\u201d. Union leaders called on Johnson to recall parliament or face further protest and court proceedings. Tim Roache, the general secretary of the GMB, said: \u201cShutting down parliament for your own ends at a time of national crisis, when people\u2019s jobs and livelihoods are on the line, beggars belief. \u201cThe prime minister needs to heed this warning, get MPs back to Westminster and sort out the mess we\u2019re in.\u201d Len McCluskey, the head of Unite, which is Labour\u2019s largest corporate donor, told Sky News that if Johnson goes to Scotland he could be subjected to a citizen\u2019s arrest. \u201cIt is quite extraordinary what the Scottish courts have ruled.

Earlier, before the judgment was released, Starmer had told delegates that Johnson must now bow to the will of parliament and seek an extension to article 50 if he fails to get as deal by 19 October. \u201cOver the summer we worked across parliament to build consensus for legislation to prevent no deal at the end of October. As of Monday, that is now law. \u201cIt means that if the prime minister fails to get a Brexit deal by 19 October \u2013 as looks increasingly inevitable \u2013 or a mandate for no deal \u2013 which is equally unlikely \u2013 he will have to seek and accept an extension to article 50. \u201cThe legal advice is clear that the prime minister must abide by this.

Almost 80 then, he seemed ineffably world-weary.</p> <p>Almost 50 years earlier, funded by a Guggenheim Fellowship, Frank had set off to drive across America, accompanied by his young wife Mary, and their two young children Pablo and Andrea, on the first of three epic road trips. The 500 rolls of film he subsequently shot were rigorously edited down to just 83 monochrome images for Les Americains, which was published in France in 1958. A year later, the American edition appeared to a storm of critical disapproval, Frank being accused of everything from \u201cgeneral sloppiness\u201d to anti-Americanism.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>I wanted to present what I saw, pure and simple</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Swiss-born Frank had photographed what he saw with his keen outsider\u2019s eye, capturing what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/feb/12/diane-arbus-in-the-beginning-review-a-genius-who-made-every-picture-a-story\">Diane Arbus </a>would later describe as \u201cthe hollowness\u201d of many American lives.

One could see why, though, all those years later, Frank had grown tired of being asked about The Americans. It remains one of the most iconic photobooks of all time, albeit one which, as he told me, needed no explanation beyond the images themselves.</p> <p>By the time of our meeting in 2004, he seemed to have grown tired even of photography, proudly showing me a catalogue of his second wife <a href=\"https://www.edwardthorpgallery.com/june-leaf\">June Leaf</a>\u2019s painting. \u201cI envy her freedom,\u201d he said, \u201cto sit down in front of a blank page with no machine to get in the way.

Photography is not freedom.\u201d</p> <p>How Frank arrived at that conclusion is perhaps not entirely to do with his relationship to the medium that he redefined, and which came to define him despite his later foray into experimental film-making. His life was also marked by great tragedy: the loss of his daughter, Andrea, aged 20, in a plane crash in Guatemala in 1974; and the death of his son, Pablo, who died in 1994 after years of mental illness. \u201cLife is not beautiful all the time,\u201d he said, just after he noticed me looking at a portrait of Pablo and him, pinned to the wall of an adjacent room. \u201cLife can be good, then you lie down, and stare up at the ceiling, and the sadness falls on you.

In one of its most powerful pictures, his hand, reflected in a mirror, holds a tiny skeleton doll, the words \u201csick of goodby\u2019s\u201d are smeared on the glass. His work, he told me, had \u201cshifted from being about what I saw to being about what I felt\u201d. Photography, though, could not contain nor express the depth of his sadness. \u201cI was really destroying the picture,\u201d he says, staring at the floor. \u201cI didn\u2019t believe in the beauty of a photograph anymore.\u201d</p> <p>If Robert Frank\u2019s legacy rests mainly on The Americans, it is worth remembering how restless his creative imagination was, from the freeform anarchy of films like <a href=\"https://www.idfa.nl/en/film/08dfd673-ea14-4d86-940d-79e0169e6872/pull-my-daisy?gclid=CjwKCAjwk93rBRBLEiwAcMapUdRfMAPLsEZ57zJTpEpqP5T6c72yc_1qhP8fIZFvINIGjkk4ZYneJBoCXt0QAvD_BwE\">Pull My Daisy</a>, an unruly evocation of the Beat aesthetic featuring Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg, to the infamous <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/cocksucker-blues-robert-franks-suppressed-rolling-stones-documentary-comes-to-film-forum\">Cocksucker Blues</a>, his verite and decidedly downbeat take on life on the road with the Rolling Stones at their most glamorously debauched.</p> <p>Frank\u2019s singular vision did not sit well with Mick Jagger, who set out to suppress the film. \u201cThey sent lawyers, they sent planes, they sent the sheriff,\u201d he told me, laughing, \u201cIt was out of proportion, like everything they did. It was comical really. I fled to Nova Scotia. I just wanted to be left alone.\u201d In his absence, the Stones won a prohibitive court order that banned its screening unless Frank himself was present. Its infamy grew accordingly.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>The Stones sent lawyers, they sent planes, they sent the sheriff. It was comical really. I just wanted to be left alone</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Frank remained an outsider until the end, and an increasingly reclusive one. He had served his apprenticeship with the great <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/may/16/walker-evans-photographer-magazine-work-master\">Walker Evans</a>, who, he said, never allowed him to watch while he worked. Frank\u2019s influence eclipsed that of his mentor, which is saying something, and was such that it touched even those who seemed to reject his spare, documentary approach.</p> <p>\u201cI had Robert Frank\u2019s The Americans as a teenager,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/nov/03/jeff-wall-photography-marian-goodman-gallery-show\">the photography pioneer Jeff Wall once told me</a>. \u201cIn fact, I made pencil drawings from various photographs in it. Frank and Walker Evans closed the door for me. What they did was so well done, I could never have matched it and I don\u2019t think anyone has. They nailed it once and for all. That was a huge realisation \u2013 that I could not follow in their footsteps.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/nov/07/robert-frank-americans-photography-influence-shadows\">Artist Ed Ruscha concurred</a>, once saying: \u201cSeeing The Americans in a college bookshop was a stunning, ground-trembling experience for me. But I realised this man\u2019s achievement could not be mined or imitated in any way, because he had already done it, sewn it up and gone home. What I was left with was the vapours of his talent. I had to make my own kind of art. But wow! The Americans!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b300690138d4bd35d586df24644bd0de551d12b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b300690138d4bd35d586df24644bd0de551d12b7/0_0_2400_2935/818.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The kind of photography I did is gone.

It was part of his past, photography\u2019s past, and he was an artist who did not look back. \u201cThe kind of photography I did is gone. It\u2019s old,\u201d he told me in 2004, as the digital deluge gathered pace. \u201cThere\u2019s no point in it any more for me, and I get no satisfaction from trying to do it. There are too many pictures now. It\u2019s overwhelming. A flood of images that passes by, and says, \u2018Why should we remember anything?\u2019 There is too much to remember now, too much to take in.\u201d</p> <p>Yet we do remember \u2013 and revere \u2013 what he saw and what he achieved with The Americans. Through his deep looking, he taught us how to see the world anew, without sentiment or illusion. His alert and unforgiving gaze showed many Americans what was right under their noses yet invisible to them. It was, in retrospect, a wake-up call but, more than that, a beautiful, if bleakly poetic, vision of modern America, as evocative and unrelenting in its way as any work by Philip Roth or Saul Bellow.</p> <p>The last time I saw Robert Frank, he was sitting outside his Greenwich Village apartment with June, on a warm late summer day. An old couple bathing in the last of the early evening sun. We chatted and, as I was departing, I told him they looked like they belonged in one of his early photographs. I think I detected the ghost of a smile. I think of him now, the instinctive outsider, the sad genius of American photography, and his words echo in my head \u2026 \u201cThings move on, time passes, people go away, and sometimes they don\u2019t come back.\u201d Only the photographs remain, resonant and unsparingly truthful. In them, he lives on.</p>",

Photography, though, could not contain nor express the depth of his sadness. \u201cI was really destroying the picture,\u201d he says, staring at the floor. \u201cI didn\u2019t believe in the beauty of a photograph anymore.\u201d If Robert Frank\u2019s legacy rests mainly on The Americans, it is worth remembering how restless his creative imagination was, from the freeform anarchy of films like Pull My Daisy, an unruly evocation of the Beat aesthetic featuring Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg, to the infamous Cocksucker Blues, his verite and decidedly downbeat take on life on the road with the Rolling Stones at their most glamorously debauched. Frank\u2019s singular vision did not sit well with Mick Jagger, who set out to suppress the film. \u201cThey sent lawyers, they sent planes, they sent the sheriff,\u201d he told me, laughing, \u201cIt was out of proportion, like everything they did. It was comical really. I fled to Nova Scotia. I just wanted to be left alone.\u201d In his absence, the Stones won a prohibitive court order that banned its screening unless Frank himself was present. Its infamy grew accordingly. Frank remained an outsider until the end, and an increasingly reclusive one. He had served his apprenticeship with the great Walker Evans, who, he said, never allowed him to watch while he worked. Frank\u2019s influence eclipsed that of his mentor, which is saying something, and was such that it touched even those who seemed to reject his spare, documentary approach. \u201cI had Robert Frank\u2019s The Americans as a teenager,\u201d the photography pioneer Jeff Wall once told me. \u201cIn fact, I made pencil drawings from various photographs in it. Frank and Walker Evans closed the door for me. What they did was so well done, I could never have matched it and I don\u2019t think anyone has. They nailed it once and for all. That was a huge realisation \u2013 that I could not follow in their footsteps.\u201d Artist Ed Ruscha concurred, once saying: \u201cSeeing The Americans in a college bookshop was a stunning, ground-trembling experience for me. But I realised this man\u2019s achievement could not be mined or imitated in any way, because he had already done it, sewn it up and gone home. What I was left with was the vapours of his talent. I had to make my own kind of art. But wow! The Americans!\u201d Frank, alone, seemed less convinced by, or simply uninterested in, his own achievement. It was part of his past, photography\u2019s past, and he was an artist who did not look back. \u201cThe kind of photography I did is gone. It\u2019s old,\u201d he told me in 2004, as the digital deluge gathered pace. \u201cThere\u2019s no point in it any more for me, and I get no satisfaction from trying to do it. There are too many pictures now. It\u2019s overwhelming. A flood of images that passes by, and says, \u2018Why should we remember anything?\u2019 There is too much to remember now, too much to take in.\u201d Yet we do remember \u2013 and revere \u2013 what he saw and what he achieved with The Americans. Through his deep looking, he taught us how to see the world anew, without sentiment or illusion. His alert and unforgiving gaze showed many Americans what was right under their noses yet invisible to them. It was, in retrospect, a wake-up call but, more than that, a beautiful, if bleakly poetic, vision of modern America, as evocative and unrelenting in its way as any work by Philip Roth or Saul Bellow. The last time I saw Robert Frank, he was sitting outside his Greenwich Village apartment with June, on a warm late summer day. An old couple bathing in the last of the early evening sun. We chatted and, as I was departing, I told him they looked like they belonged in one of his early photographs. I think I detected the ghost of a smile. I think of him now, the instinctive outsider, the sad genius of American photography, and his words echo in my head \u2026 \u201cThings move on, time passes, people go away, and sometimes they don\u2019t come back.\u201d Only the photographs remain, resonant and unsparingly truthful. In them, he lives on.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cI found shelter in a bakery from the water canons and tear gas,\u201d says Yasemin*, a resident of Istanbul, recalling one fateful day in April 2013. She is not describing one of the many demonstrations that would snowball into Istanbul\u2019s massive Gezi Park protests only a month later. Yasemin is remembering the 32nd Istanbul International Film Festival.</p> <p>The Emek Resistance, as it came to be known, started when the Turkish authorities began to demolish the film festival\u2019s flagship location, the historic Emek cinema. News that the 875-seater 1920s building was to be replaced with yet another shopping centre (Istanbul had around 100 shopping centres at the time; today it has 114) politicised old and young festival-goers alike. Istanbullus like Yasemin took to the streets to demonstrate against unchecked urban development in the district of Beyo\u011flu. It was a precursor to a summer of city-wide dissent.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Sundance is often one of the first things international business and government leaders know about Utah</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What the 2013 Istanbul International Film Festival triggered was in many ways unique \u2014 but its political and social impact was not. Film festivals have long facilitated alternative cultural practices, avant-garde aesthetics, and the meeting of groups marginalised due to their political beliefs, sexualities or ethnicities.</p> <p>Film festivals have been around for almost a century, but more than three-quarters of those currently active were created in the past 20 years. Today <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_film_festivals\">there are over 500</a> major international film festivals, and <a href=\"https://stephenfollows.com/many-film-festivals-are-in-the-world/\">thousands of local</a>, niche, and intermittent ones. They are a truly global phenomena, cropping up everywhere from the Gambia, where the Cinekambiya International Film Festival promotes indigenous language films, to Iraqi Kurdistan, whose Duhok International Film Festival <a href=\"https://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/comment/festivals/duhok-international-film-festival-kurdistan-2016\">continued right through</a> the 2016 siege of nearby Mosul.</p> <p>But, from Venice to Park City, Cannes to Shanghai, do film festivals turn their host cities wealthier year-round or bleed their resources? Do they help preserve a city\u2019s character or globalise it?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e2780c6d1ad55b796d3bfa3748ce52bb06e97d57\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2780c6d1ad55b796d3bfa3748ce52bb06e97d57/0_339_5520_3312/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protestors confront police during a demonstration in Istanbul against the controversial demolition of the city\u2019s historic Emek Cinema in 2013.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protestors confront police during a demonstration in Istanbul against the controversial demolition of the city\u2019s historic Emek Cinema in 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Selin Alemdar/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The world\u2019s earliest film festivals, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/venicefilmfestival\">Venice</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/cannesfilmfestival\">Cannes</a>, were founded in 1932 and 1939 respectively but only blossomed after the second world war. Technology improved as Europe focused on economic recovery and urban reconstruction, spurring a re-invigoration of the arts. Film festivals also coupled conveniently with post-war efforts at international diplomacy and tourism \u2013 in fact the first president of the Venice Film Festival was the founder of a hotel chain.</p> <p>Today, film festivals operate more like micro economies. They can make smaller cities boom by bringing in business, giving young people a reason to remain in the region, and developing a city\u2019s national and international links. Park City in Utah, home of the prestigious Sundance Film Festival, is one example. At least 122,000 people attended the 2019 edition this winter, with out-of-state visitors spending an estimated $149m (\u00a3120m). Planning and producing festival events created 3,052 jobs for residents. Miles Hansen, president and CEO of the state\u2019s World Trade Center, says: \u201cSundance is often one of the first things international business and government leaders know about Utah.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0262d15558d1faa8f730a507660e71941d9266ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0262d15558d1faa8f730a507660e71941d9266ba/0_0_4256_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Out of state visitors spent an estimated $149m in Park City, Utah during the 2019 Sundance Film Festival.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Out of state visitors spent an estimated $149m in Park City, Utah during the 2019 Sundance Film Festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fred Hayes/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But when a city becomes this synonymous with its film festival \u2013 and the kind of visitor that the global arthouse circuit draws \u2013 the effects can be mixed.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People didn\u2019t know how to search for gay and lesbian films,\u201d says. \u201cWhen we asked them to come to our festival, they asked, \u2018are there such films?\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The economic boosts delivered by a festival, such as large visitor numbers, can also drive up prices and put undue strain on the local environment. Venice is a case in point. The city has tried everything from taxes on day-trippers to bans on wheeled suitcases in an attempt to limit tourist numbers, but attendees of the Venice International Film Festival would hardly blink at \u20ac10. Widely seen as an Academy Award launchpad, it draws both the Hollywood glitterati and the discreet rich of the European indie arthouse circuit. The festival\u2019s logistical demands temporarily monopolise Venice\u2019s human resources. The end result is that businesses servicing the needs and desires of this high-flying group \u2013 luxury restaurants, private transport companies, florists, hotels \u2013 benefit, while those that provide city residents with their everyday needs \u2013 grocers, pharmacies, schools \u2013 usually don\u2019t.</p> <p>But a host city\u2019s inhabitants can also claim a film festival as their own, especially if the programme is specialised. These can be identity-based, like BFI\u2019s Flare LGBTQI+ Film Festival in London and the American Black Film Festival in Miami; issue-based, like the <a href=\"https://ff.hrw.org/cities\">multi-city Human Rights Watch Film Festival</a> and Kuala Lumpur\u2019s Eco Film Festival; or hyper-local, like London\u2019s East End Film Festival and the Brooklyn Film Festival.</p> <p>These festivals cement a sense of community by helping like-minded people find each other in their city. In conservative societies, this can be a rare feeling for minorities. John Badalu, who founded Jakarta\u2019s Q! Film Festival in 2001, <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08949468.2018.1428015?src=recsys\">recalls that</a>, at the time, Indonesia\u2019s LGBT communities had never seen themselves represented on screen. \u201cPeople didn\u2019t know how to search for gay and lesbian films,\u201d says. \u201cWhen we asked them to come to our festival, they asked, \u2018are there such films?\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3517fbb1f94b15445e00e2626b0fa5e4c3e641c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3517fbb1f94b15445e00e2626b0fa5e4c3e641c/0_173_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A worker at the Venice Film Festival prepares to roll out the red carpet for the international film community.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A worker at the Venice Film Festival prepares to roll out the red carpet for the international film community.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yara Nardi/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Independent programming also tends to better resist state censorship, because closer relationships with the filmmakers and greater control over the programme means organisers can be agile in the face of the unexpected. The Istanbul International Film Festival is a case in point \u2013 despite the Turkish state\u2019s attempts at dubbing it \u201cterrorist propaganda\u201d, it continues to showcase Kurdish documentaries. When a screening of North<em> </em>by \u00c7ayan Demirel and Ertu\u011frul Mavio\u011flu was banned at the 2015 festival, for example, programmers organised an alternative screening, \u201cunaffiliated\u201d with the festival, for members of the public.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The film festival takes me to parts of the city where I feel like I\u2019m around my kind of people</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Sometimes, however, organisers cannot take that risk \u2013 or they have no say in the matter at all. Just this month, Beijing censored the opening film of the 2019 Shanghai International Film Festival. The 1930s war drama The Eight Hundred, which lionises the role of a small group of rebel Chinese soldiers in defeating the Japanese, <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/film/news/shanghai-film-festival-pulls-opening-film-the-eight-hundred-huayi-bros-1203243335/\">was abruptly replaced</a> for \u201ctechnical reasons\u201d \u2013 a popular euphemism for censorship.

      "bodyText": "\u201cI found shelter in a bakery from the water canons and tear gas,\u201d says Yasemin*, a resident of Istanbul, recalling one fateful day in April 2013. She is not describing one of the many demonstrations that would snowball into Istanbul\u2019s massive Gezi Park protests only a month later. Yasemin is remembering the 32nd Istanbul International Film Festival. The Emek Resistance, as it came to be known, started when the Turkish authorities began to demolish the film festival\u2019s flagship location, the historic Emek cinema. News that the 875-seater 1920s building was to be replaced with yet another shopping centre (Istanbul had around 100 shopping centres at the time; today it has 114) politicised old and young festival-goers alike. Istanbullus like Yasemin took to the streets to demonstrate against unchecked urban development in the district of Beyo\u011flu. It was a precursor to a summer of city-wide dissent. What the 2013 Istanbul International Film Festival triggered was in many ways unique \u2014 but its political and social impact was not. Film festivals have long facilitated alternative cultural practices, avant-garde aesthetics, and the meeting of groups marginalised due to their political beliefs, sexualities or ethnicities. Film festivals have been around for almost a century, but more than three-quarters of those currently active were created in the past 20 years. Today there are over 500 major international film festivals, and thousands of local, niche, and intermittent ones. They are a truly global phenomena, cropping up everywhere from the Gambia, where the Cinekambiya International Film Festival promotes indigenous language films, to Iraqi Kurdistan, whose Duhok International Film Festival continued right through the 2016 siege of nearby Mosul. But, from Venice to Park City, Cannes to Shanghai, do film festivals turn their host cities wealthier year-round or bleed their resources? Do they help preserve a city\u2019s character or globalise it? The world\u2019s earliest film festivals, Venice and Cannes, were founded in 1932 and 1939 respectively but only blossomed after the second world war. Technology improved as Europe focused on economic recovery and urban reconstruction, spurring a re-invigoration of the arts. Film festivals also coupled conveniently with post-war efforts at international diplomacy and tourism \u2013 in fact the first president of the Venice Film Festival was the founder of a hotel chain. Today, film festivals operate more like micro economies. They can make smaller cities boom by bringing in business, giving young people a reason to remain in the region, and developing a city\u2019s national and international links. Park City in Utah, home of the prestigious Sundance Film Festival, is one example. At least 122,000 people attended the 2019 edition this winter, with out-of-state visitors spending an estimated $149m (\u00a3120m). Planning and producing festival events created 3,052 jobs for residents. Miles Hansen, president and CEO of the state\u2019s World Trade Center, says: \u201cSundance is often one of the first things international business and government leaders know about Utah.\u201d But when a city becomes this synonymous with its film festival \u2013 and the kind of visitor that the global arthouse circuit draws \u2013 the effects can be mixed. The economic boosts delivered by a festival, such as large visitor numbers, can also drive up prices and put undue strain on the local environment. Venice is a case in point. The city has tried everything from taxes on day-trippers to bans on wheeled suitcases in an attempt to limit tourist numbers, but attendees of the Venice International Film Festival would hardly blink at \u20ac10. Widely seen as an Academy Award launchpad, it draws both the Hollywood glitterati and the discreet rich of the European indie arthouse circuit. The festival\u2019s logistical demands temporarily monopolise Venice\u2019s human resources. The end result is that businesses servicing the needs and desires of this high-flying group \u2013 luxury restaurants, private transport companies, florists, hotels \u2013 benefit, while those that provide city residents with their everyday needs \u2013 grocers, pharmacies, schools \u2013 usually don\u2019t. But a host city\u2019s inhabitants can also claim a film festival as their own, especially if the programme is specialised. These can be identity-based, like BFI\u2019s Flare LGBTQI+ Film Festival in London and the American Black Film Festival in Miami; issue-based, like the multi-city Human Rights Watch Film Festival and Kuala Lumpur\u2019s Eco Film Festival; or hyper-local, like London\u2019s East End Film Festival and the Brooklyn Film Festival. These festivals cement a sense of community by helping like-minded people find each other in their city. In conservative societies, this can be a rare feeling for minorities. John Badalu, who founded Jakarta\u2019s Q! Film Festival in 2001, recalls that, at the time, Indonesia\u2019s LGBT communities had never seen themselves represented on screen. \u201cPeople didn\u2019t know how to search for gay and lesbian films,\u201d says. \u201cWhen we asked them to come to our festival, they asked, \u2018are there such films?\u2019\u201d Independent programming also tends to better resist state censorship, because closer relationships with the filmmakers and greater control over the programme means organisers can be agile in the face of the unexpected. The Istanbul International Film Festival is a case in point \u2013 despite the Turkish state\u2019s attempts at dubbing it \u201cterrorist propaganda\u201d, it continues to showcase Kurdish documentaries. When a screening of North by \u00c7ayan Demirel and Ertu\u011frul Mavio\u011flu was banned at the 2015 festival, for example, programmers organised an alternative screening, \u201cunaffiliated\u201d with the festival, for members of the public. Sometimes, however, organisers cannot take that risk \u2013 or they have no say in the matter at all. Just this month, Beijing censored the opening film of the 2019 Shanghai International Film Festival. The 1930s war drama The Eight Hundred, which lionises the role of a small group of rebel Chinese soldiers in defeating the Japanese, was abruptly replaced for \u201ctechnical reasons\u201d \u2013 a popular euphemism for censorship. The social power of movies has long been a thorn on the side of authority, from the days of British rule in India to the Soviet Union in Africa. In Kiev, the Docudays UA International Human Rights Documentary Film Festival screens films on complex topical issues \u2013 last year\u2019s was focused on human rights and the \u201cdigitalisation\u201d of life. Programme coordinator Olga Birzul believes the festival content \u201chas contributed to an increase of critical thinking\u201d and played a part in creating active citizenship in a post-Soviet city. With a secessionist war in Ukraine\u2019s Donbass region ongoing, the festival organisers are trying to increase Kiev residents\u2019 literacy around human rights, encouraging the city\u2019s inhabitants to reject us-versus-them thinking. In Istanbul, the film festival enabled a grassroots progressive movement that allowed locals to vocalise long-held grievances about the destruction of Istanbul\u2019s historic neighbourhoods, the co-optation of public urban space, and money laundering via ill-conceived building projects. The AK government did demolish Emek Cinema, but it caved in to public pressure and scrapped the shopping centre idea. The \u201cNew Emek\u201d, a faithful replica of the original, was completed in 2016. \u201cThe film festival takes me to parts of the city where I feel like I\u2019m around my kind of people,\u201d says Ege, a graduate student from Istanbul. \u201cIt makes me think, \u2018oh ok, so there are a lot of people who care about the issues I do\u2019.\u201d *Some names have been changed Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter",

Although the US were far from full-strength \u2013 with the NBA\u2019s biggest American stars opting out of the tournament \u2013 they still fielded a team that included talented players such as Jaylen Brown, Donovan Mitchell and three-time All Star Kemba Walker. The team was also coached by Gregg Popovich, a five-time NBA champion. The result ended a 58-game win streak for the US at the Olympics and World Cups. \u201cJust got to take it like a man at this point,\u201d Walker said after the game. \u201cWe lost. There\u2019s nothing we can do. We competed. We\u2019ve been competing since day one that we got to training camp. But we gave it everything we\u2019ve got. I know we\u2019re Team USA and things of that nature and they\u2019ve been winning for a lot of years, but you know, we didn\u2019t get a chance to pull it off.\u201d France pulled off their 89-79 victory after overhauling a seven-point deficit in the fourth quarter. Their own NBA stars helped fuel the victory: Evan Fournier scored 22 points, while Rudy Gobert added 21 points and 16 rebounds. France had never beaten the US in nine previous meetings in major international competition. There had been signs that the Americans\u2019 reign as champions could end. They scraped past Turkey 93-92 in overtime earlier in the tournament, with the Turks missing four free-throws late in the game. The US now face Serbia in a mini-tournament to decide who will finish in fifth to eighth place. The Americans had been attempting to become the first team to win three consecutive World Cups and three consecutive Olympics. \u201cWe came here to win gold,\u201d Gobert said of his team, who now face Argentina in the semi-final. \u201cWe knew it wasn\u2019t going to be easy. A lot of people counted us out, but we got the win.\u201d Australia will play Spain in the other semi-final.",

Bolton has spent the better part of his tenure in the Trump administration disparaging the treaty, repeatedly signaling that the US wouldn\u2019t put much effort toward renewing it before it expires in February 2021. But while our collective outlook going forward is promising without Bolton anywhere near the levers of power, the trail of flames he has left behind will have lasting damage.

Mere months before joining the Trump administration, Bolton attempted to make a legal argument for an unprovoked first strike on North Korea, and he made sure to preserve that option by standing in the way of Trump\u2019s diplomatic efforts to reduce tensions (Trump himself created) with Kim Jong-un. Bolton\u2019s efforts became so intrusive that Trump apparently banished him to Mongolia when he decided to pay a visit to Kim at the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea. It\u2019s unclear whether we will be able to reverse Bolton\u2019s path of destruction, as it probably also depends on whether Trump wins the presidential election again. But the tragic subplot to the Trump-era Bolton debacle is the persistence of the constant revolving door of failure in Washington that is fueled by deep pockets and an insider media environment that is incapable of holding anyone to account. Bolton\u2019s disastrous ideas have been thoroughly discredited and his political and policy career should have been cast aside long ago, perhaps even after the Senate declined to bless his nomination as US ambassador to the United Nations back in 2005 because of his extremist views.

      "body": "<p>Wine is such a simple a pleasure: the fragrance, the flavour, the mellow enjoyment of a glass over a good meal with friends. OK, some of that mellowness is chemically induced, but alcohol too is simple, as long as it\u2019s taken in moderation.</p> <p>So, if drinking wine is straightforward, why must choosing it be quite so complicated? There are countries and regions and quality levels and grapes. Wine labels vary wildly: an Australian chardonnay will have the country and the grape somewhere on the label, but nothing on a typical chablis will tell you it is also made with chardonnay grapes.</p> <p>There are two ways to look at this. The first is that learning is half the fun. Just as most of us wouldn\u2019t get the cultural references threaded through our language unless they were pointed out to us, so wine is a cultural artefact with a whole set of references attached. You don\u2019t need to know them, but to know them is to be part of a conversation \u2013 just as people who get Shakespeare references are participating in a 400-year discussion on the nature of Englishness.</p> <p>Second, if I am going to put something in my body, and serve it to my guests, I would quite like to know what it is.</p> <p>That brings us to the latest development designed to muddle the heads of the thirsty. Natural wine is all the rage: some bars are dedicated to it, while others focus on artisanal wines of all kinds, including organic or biodynamic. Which is marvellous, except that the differences between these designations are not immediately clear. If a wine is labelled biodynamic, what does that mean? And if it isn\u2019t so labelled, is it definitely not biodynamic? So here, for the terminally puzzled, is a quick guide to the new terminology.</p> <h2><strong>Organic wine</strong></h2> <p>This is the simplest of the new categories. Organic wine, like organic food, is made without the use of artificial pesticides, fungicides, herbicides etc, according to rules laid down by bodies such as the Soil Association. Vine-growers can promote growth and fight disease using naturally occurring products, such as sulphur dioxide, or they can introduce predators or induce sexual confusion, using pheromones to prevent moths mating and producing vine-destroying caterpillars. In the winery, they must also avoid prohibited additives.</p> <p>Organic wine is relatively uncontroversial, since most winemakers and wine-drinkers who are interested in quality and sustainability agree that avoiding substances that might affect human or environmental health is a good idea. Terrible weather conditions \u2013 the droughts, frost, hail and downpours that are becoming more frequent and severe with the climate crisis \u2013 can ruin crops, tempting smaller winemakers to break the rules. Still, the thinking goes, many of the non-organic fixes will ultimately destroy the soil and the vineyard, not to mention affect the taste of the wine.</p> <p><em>Tempted?

      "bodyText": "Wine is such a simple a pleasure: the fragrance, the flavour, the mellow enjoyment of a glass over a good meal with friends. OK, some of that mellowness is chemically induced, but alcohol too is simple, as long as it\u2019s taken in moderation. So, if drinking wine is straightforward, why must choosing it be quite so complicated? There are countries and regions and quality levels and grapes. Wine labels vary wildly: an Australian chardonnay will have the country and the grape somewhere on the label, but nothing on a typical chablis will tell you it is also made with chardonnay grapes. There are two ways to look at this. The first is that learning is half the fun. Just as most of us wouldn\u2019t get the cultural references threaded through our language unless they were pointed out to us, so wine is a cultural artefact with a whole set of references attached. You don\u2019t need to know them, but to know them is to be part of a conversation \u2013 just as people who get Shakespeare references are participating in a 400-year discussion on the nature of Englishness. Second, if I am going to put something in my body, and serve it to my guests, I would quite like to know what it is. That brings us to the latest development designed to muddle the heads of the thirsty. Natural wine is all the rage: some bars are dedicated to it, while others focus on artisanal wines of all kinds, including organic or biodynamic. Which is marvellous, except that the differences between these designations are not immediately clear. If a wine is labelled biodynamic, what does that mean? And if it isn\u2019t so labelled, is it definitely not biodynamic? So here, for the terminally puzzled, is a quick guide to the new terminology. Organic wine This is the simplest of the new categories. Organic wine, like organic food, is made without the use of artificial pesticides, fungicides, herbicides etc, according to rules laid down by bodies such as the Soil Association. Vine-growers can promote growth and fight disease using naturally occurring products, such as sulphur dioxide, or they can introduce predators or induce sexual confusion, using pheromones to prevent moths mating and producing vine-destroying caterpillars. In the winery, they must also avoid prohibited additives. Organic wine is relatively uncontroversial, since most winemakers and wine-drinkers who are interested in quality and sustainability agree that avoiding substances that might affect human or environmental health is a good idea. Terrible weather conditions \u2013 the droughts, frost, hail and downpours that are becoming more frequent and severe with the climate crisis \u2013 can ruin crops, tempting smaller winemakers to break the rules. Still, the thinking goes, many of the non-organic fixes will ultimately destroy the soil and the vineyard, not to mention affect the taste of the wine. Tempted? Try Ch\u00e2teau Musar (Lebanon) or Domaine de la Mordor\u00e9e (France). Biodynamic wine Biodynamic winemaking follows the principles of the philosopher Rudolf Steiner and is based on the idea that, in order for it to reach its full potential, a vineyard needs to be well-balanced and harmonious. Organic is good, runs this thinking, but doesn\u2019t go nearly far enough. Some parts of the methodology are obvious; others are weird.

Even if advancements like gene-drive technologies are successful at eradicating malaria, without profound economic and political reforms to address extreme poverty and improve primary healthcare, sub-Saharan Africa will remain vulnerable to the emergence of new infectious diseases \u2013 as demonstrated by the Ebola outbreak in west Africa a few years ago and the current Ebola outbreak in DRC. \u2022 Jonathan Kennedy is a lecturer in global health at Queen Mary University of London",

      "body": "<p>It is 4am on a balmy June night in Barcelona, and on a beachside stage at Primavera Sound festival, one of the finest talents in electronic music is leaping into the unknown. TJ Hertz, AKA Objekt, is one of the most beloved DJs and producers around. His tracks and albums routinely top end-of-year lists in the dance music press; their density and technique pleases the chinstrokers at the back, while their goofiness and fun gets hands in the air down the front.</p> <p>And yet this is his first ever live set, a show he brings to the UK this week. Hertz stands behind a bank of equipment playing crystalline, deconstructed club music and singing through a vocoder while Ezra Miller, a young American visual artist, stands opposite triggering mesmeric visuals in time with the staccato beats and broken melodies.</p> <p>The show represents Hertz\u2019s desire to \u201cfind a way to connect with people from beyond the club world\u201d, as he explains over tea at his airy apartment in the Kreuzberg district of Berlin a few weeks later. \u201cI wanted to give people who might not usually find themselves on a dancefloor a route into listening to electronic music that they might otherwise find quite out-there.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSwyDF0RfHQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kSwyDF0RfHQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>As a slow convert to electronic music himself, Hertz knows the power of a good gateway drug. Born in Japan in 1987 to a Filipino mother and British-American father, he spent his formative years in Belgium and, from the age of 11, the UK. His mother was a composer and there were always plenty of records around the house, but his childhood and teenage years were spent playing the drums, completely ignoring electronic music.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until around 2007, when the \u201cblog house\u201d phenomenon \u2013 the trashy, clubby sound from acts and labels like Justice and Ed Banger \u2013 blew up that Hertz took any notice. \u201cMy only exposure to dance music before that was the Vengaboys and Ti\u00ebsto and whatever other awful shit was on The Box,\u201d he laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s ironic that blog house and Ed Banger were what finally got me into it, because in retrospect they weren\u2019t much better than the Vengaboys or Ti\u00ebsto, but at least they had a slightly better aesthetic.\u201d</p> <p>By then, Hertz was at Oxford University studying engineering. \u201cBy the time I went to uni I had given up on the idea of drumming professionally, but promised myself that I would keep doing it as a hobby \u2013 I just transferred the promise from drumming over to DJing and production,\u201d he says. He started DJing in bars around Oxford and playing around with production programmes, and by the time he left university was good enough to land a development job in Berlin with the music software manufacturer Native Instruments. He kept producing on the side and his burgeoning hobby finally culminated in the release of his first EP, Objekt #1, in 2011.</p> <p>His two albums since, 2014\u2019s Flatland and last year\u2019s Cocoon Crush, are fascinating adventures in deeply textured, frequently arrhythmic and highly atmospheric sound design. Running in parallel is the completely different universe of his 12-inch singles, with which he takes on whatever club-music style takes his fancy. Last year\u2019s rave-referencing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDRNdNXBZcQ\">Theme f</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDRNdNXBZcQ\">rom Q</a> joined a canon of tracks including the big-room techno of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjZQpsVXqEg\">CLK Recovery</a>, the wobbly dubstep of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XU6DnRMrZo\">Cactus</a> and the popping electro of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHQtzAbG2-4\">Fishbone</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9b300d7fd2cd0b48f0509e0791fc9235359b558f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b300d7fd2cd0b48f0509e0791fc9235359b558f/0_0_3336_5183/644.jpg\" alt=\"Dance music producer TJ Hertz, aka Objekt.\" width=\"644\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dance music producer TJ Hertz, aka Objekt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kasia Zacharko</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a DJ, too, Hertz is an innovator in a world plagued by single-speed staleness and conservatism. Where many DJs plug in a USB, knock out two hours of techno and collect their fee, Hertz has always looked to push the form forward, whether by deploying delay pedals and CDJ trickery to reshape a record on the fly or by using polyrhythmic mixing techniques to pull off transitions between the unlikeliest of sounds. His <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/dkmntl/dekmantel-podcast-116-objekt\">2017 Dekmantel mix</a> is the best place to hear the latter skill in action: ambient soundscapes, jungle, wonky synth tracks and pounding techno sluice around each other. It should be a terrible mess \u2013 but it works.</p> <p>Hertz is known for his ability to read and react to a crowd, lathering audiences into a grinning, ceiling-slapping frenzy \u2013 and an essential part of it is his filing system. He flips open his laptop and takes me through the dozens of folders he studiously maintains and adds to on a daily basis: \u201cCurious George\u201d, \u201cWitching Hour\u201d, \u201cFloaty Rollers\u201d, \u201cGritted Teeth\u201d, \u201cEmosh (Very)\u201d and \u201cEmosh (Liminal)\u201d, \u201cRecent Power Selection\u201d, \u201cRecent Festival\u201d, \u201cNo-kick Rollers\u201d\u2026</p> <p>A man who wrings whimsy from the dry stuff of computer folders, Hertz is neither stuffy boffin nor tongue-lolling rave lad, but rather self-deprecating and unassuming. \u201cI often sit down in the studio and feel like I\u2019ve completely forgotten how to make music,\u201d he admits endearingly. Despite years of critical acclaim this is no false modesty: Hertz had been touring internationally for three years and had made his second album before he finally felt able to quit his day job.</p> <p>Back in Barcelona, Hertz\u2019s movements are being mapped to a gigantic, bumptious-looking dust mite on the screen behind him in the lead-up to a brilliantly theatrical final section that transforms a slow-building, artful electronics workout into a full-on rave complete with lasers, horns and piledriving 303 synths. The show is Hertz\u2019s career in microcosm: fearlessly innovative, intricately detailed, obsessively well-executed and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 glorious, sweaty fun.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Objekt and Ezra Miller play at the Islington Assembly Hall in London on 12 September</em><em>.</em></p></li> </ul>",

His two albums since, 2014\u2019s Flatland and last year\u2019s Cocoon Crush, are fascinating adventures in deeply textured, frequently arrhythmic and highly atmospheric sound design. Running in parallel is the completely different universe of his 12-inch singles, with which he takes on whatever club-music style takes his fancy. Last year\u2019s rave-referencing Theme from Q joined a canon of tracks including the big-room techno of CLK Recovery, the wobbly dubstep of Cactus and the popping electro of Fishbone. As a DJ, too, Hertz is an innovator in a world plagued by single-speed staleness and conservatism. Where many DJs plug in a USB, knock out two hours of techno and collect their fee, Hertz has always looked to push the form forward, whether by deploying delay pedals and CDJ trickery to reshape a record on the fly or by using polyrhythmic mixing techniques to pull off transitions between the unlikeliest of sounds. His 2017 Dekmantel mix is the best place to hear the latter skill in action: ambient soundscapes, jungle, wonky synth tracks and pounding techno sluice around each other. It should be a terrible mess \u2013 but it works. Hertz is known for his ability to read and react to a crowd, lathering audiences into a grinning, ceiling-slapping frenzy \u2013 and an essential part of it is his filing system. He flips open his laptop and takes me through the dozens of folders he studiously maintains and adds to on a daily basis: \u201cCurious George\u201d, \u201cWitching Hour\u201d, \u201cFloaty Rollers\u201d, \u201cGritted Teeth\u201d, \u201cEmosh (Very)\u201d and \u201cEmosh (Liminal)\u201d, \u201cRecent Power Selection\u201d, \u201cRecent Festival\u201d, \u201cNo-kick Rollers\u201d\u2026 A man who wrings whimsy from the dry stuff of computer folders, Hertz is neither stuffy boffin nor tongue-lolling rave lad, but rather self-deprecating and unassuming. \u201cI often sit down in the studio and feel like I\u2019ve completely forgotten how to make music,\u201d he admits endearingly. Despite years of critical acclaim this is no false modesty: Hertz had been touring internationally for three years and had made his second album before he finally felt able to quit his day job. Back in Barcelona, Hertz\u2019s movements are being mapped to a gigantic, bumptious-looking dust mite on the screen behind him in the lead-up to a brilliantly theatrical final section that transforms a slow-building, artful electronics workout into a full-on rave complete with lasers, horns and piledriving 303 synths. The show is Hertz\u2019s career in microcosm: fearlessly innovative, intricately detailed, obsessively well-executed and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 glorious, sweaty fun.

      "body": "<p>The summoning of the Iranian ambassador to the British Foreign Office on Wednesday over broken assurances about the destination of an Iranian oil tanker, and now the arrest of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/11/british-australian-women-detained-arrested-iran-tehran\">two British-Australian nationals</a>, marks yet another stage in the mutual blame game between Britain and Iran that leaves the relationship stuck deeper in a frustrating rut.</p> <p>From the British perspective, well articulated by the former Middle East minister Alistair Burt, those in the UK government who would have liked to build a new relationship with Iran in the wake of the 2015 nuclear deal feel very badly let down by Tehran.</p> <p>Not only has there been no progress in high-profile consular cases such as that of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, arrested for spying in 2016, there has also been a steady stream of other British-Iranian dual nationals picked up on spurious grounds in recent weeks. Kameel Ahmady, an Iranian-British social anthropologist was arrested on 11 August and had no contact with his family except three phone calls. On 27 August, another Iranian-British citizen <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/08/27/uk-accused-failing-british-iranian-nationals-another-convicted/\">Anousheh Ashouri</a>, a businessman who has been imprisoned since 2017, had been sentenced to 12 years in prison allegedly for spying for Israel\u2019s Mossad intelligence agency and receiving \u20ac33,000 (\u00a329,000) in illicit funds.</p> <p>On 18 August, Iran\u2019s appeals court upheld a 10-year prison sentence against British Council employee <a href=\"http://www.iranhumanrights.org/2019/08/british-council-employees-10-year-prison-sentence-upheld-without-a-hearing/\">Aras Amiri</a> for \u201cforming and organising a network for the purpose of overthrowing the Islamic Republic.\u201d</p> <p>The latest arrest of three Australians, two with British passports, came around this time, but marks a new low point since they had no Iranian nationality. It has even led the Foreign Office to discreetly warn UK journalists thinking of travelling to Tehran independently against doing so.</p> <p>There is a general crackdown on free speech under way in Iran, covering Iranian journalists and human rights activists largely ordered by the judiciary chief Ebrahim Raisi, appointed in March 2019. The arrests have been the subject of public protest by reformist MPs.</p> <p>But there is no doubt in British minds that these Australians have been targeted because of the approach of the UK and Australian governments to the wider Iran crisis.</p> <p>Similarly there is real anger in the Foreign Office that Iran has broken assurances given to British and Gibraltarian officials on what is said to be five occasions that if the Iranian ship seized by the British was released, it would not travel to Syria to unload its oil. Those assurances were given in a note, as well as verbally and personally by the Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, British diplomats say.</p> <p>Iran\u2019s envoy to London said on Wednesday the oil cargo of tanker Adrian Darya 1 was sold at sea to a private company, denying Tehran had broken assurances it had given over the vessel. He also insisted any EU\u2019s sanctions on exports to Syria did not apply to Tehran. </p> <p>The original impounding of the ship by the British on grounds that it was intent on breaching the EU embargo on oil sales to Syria, may not have been a far-seeing piece of UK diplomacy, and largely reflected US private pressure to do so, but the ship\u2019s release was negotiated by the British in a matter of five weeks.</p> <p>It was also released on 15 August in the knowledge that Iran had not yet released the British flagged Stena Impero, which was seized on 19 July as it passed through the strait of Hormuz. Seven of the 23 crew have been released, but the ship remains in Iranian hands.</p> <p>The Iranian Foreign Office at the weekend said the ship would be released soon, but in the complex Iranian government, the writ of the Iranian Foreign Office is not sacrosanct.</p> <p>From the British perspective the episode has made the UK look naive in the eyes of the US administration for even taking the Iranians\u2019 words seriously. The now departed US national security adviser John Bolton openly mocked the British for being in denial about the true nature of Iran.</p> <p>British advocates of dialogue, such as Burt, say Tehran does not seem to understand the value of a unilateral gesture on issues such as releasing hostages, or how it could unlock something different.</p> <p>From the Iranian perspective, the catalogue of British failings is equally long. Grace 1, the Iranian ship, should never have been impounded since Iran is not obliged to follow an EU sanctions regime. The UK government has spent close on 30 years, and millions in legal costs, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/may/28/mod-and-foreign-office-clash-over-400m-debt-linked-to-zaghari-ratcliffe-release\">refusing to pay the debt courts say it owes to Iran for the sale of Chieftain tanks</a>.</p> <p>Above all Europeans, including Britain, talk a big game about the need for European sovereignty, but faced with an overweening US administration imposing sanctions on anyone that trades with Iran, the EU has proved powerless, and says the effectiveness of such sanctions is a necessary by-product of the dollar\u2019s ubiquity as a trading currency.</p> <p>The bigger question is whether the departure of Bolton will, as hoped, reveal an opening in the cul-de-sac that is western-European relations. Burt, speaking to the Lords international relations committee last week, made the point that if Trump has decided not to go to war with Iran, as he appeared to when he did not retaliate for the downing of a US drone by Iran, the logical step must be to talk Tehran.</p> <p>Emmanuel Macron, the French president, has been trying to create the detailed circumstances for this to occur. The US administration said again that Trump was willing to hold a summit with the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, at the UN general assembly in New York this month.</p> <p>But for these high-profile \u201clook me in the eye\u201d summits to work, or for there to be any relenting on US sanctions, the ground debris has to be cleared. Issues like impounded ships, broken promises and hostage-taking have to be addressed. At the moment, there is no sign that is happening.

      "bodyText": "The summoning of the Iranian ambassador to the British Foreign Office on Wednesday over broken assurances about the destination of an Iranian oil tanker, and now the arrest of two British-Australian nationals, marks yet another stage in the mutual blame game between Britain and Iran that leaves the relationship stuck deeper in a frustrating rut. From the British perspective, well articulated by the former Middle East minister Alistair Burt, those in the UK government who would have liked to build a new relationship with Iran in the wake of the 2015 nuclear deal feel very badly let down by Tehran. Not only has there been no progress in high-profile consular cases such as that of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, arrested for spying in 2016, there has also been a steady stream of other British-Iranian dual nationals picked up on spurious grounds in recent weeks. Kameel Ahmady, an Iranian-British social anthropologist was arrested on 11 August and had no contact with his family except three phone calls. On 27 August, another Iranian-British citizen Anousheh Ashouri, a businessman who has been imprisoned since 2017, had been sentenced to 12 years in prison allegedly for spying for Israel\u2019s Mossad intelligence agency and receiving \u20ac33,000 (\u00a329,000) in illicit funds. On 18 August, Iran\u2019s appeals court upheld a 10-year prison sentence against British Council employee Aras Amiri for \u201cforming and organising a network for the purpose of overthrowing the Islamic Republic.\u201d The latest arrest of three Australians, two with British passports, came around this time, but marks a new low point since they had no Iranian nationality. It has even led the Foreign Office to discreetly warn UK journalists thinking of travelling to Tehran independently against doing so. There is a general crackdown on free speech under way in Iran, covering Iranian journalists and human rights activists largely ordered by the judiciary chief Ebrahim Raisi, appointed in March 2019. The arrests have been the subject of public protest by reformist MPs. But there is no doubt in British minds that these Australians have been targeted because of the approach of the UK and Australian governments to the wider Iran crisis. Similarly there is real anger in the Foreign Office that Iran has broken assurances given to British and Gibraltarian officials on what is said to be five occasions that if the Iranian ship seized by the British was released, it would not travel to Syria to unload its oil. Those assurances were given in a note, as well as verbally and personally by the Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, British diplomats say. Iran\u2019s envoy to London said on Wednesday the oil cargo of tanker Adrian Darya 1 was sold at sea to a private company, denying Tehran had broken assurances it had given over the vessel. He also insisted any EU\u2019s sanctions on exports to Syria did not apply to Tehran. The original impounding of the ship by the British on grounds that it was intent on breaching the EU embargo on oil sales to Syria, may not have been a far-seeing piece of UK diplomacy, and largely reflected US private pressure to do so, but the ship\u2019s release was negotiated by the British in a matter of five weeks. It was also released on 15 August in the knowledge that Iran had not yet released the British flagged Stena Impero, which was seized on 19 July as it passed through the strait of Hormuz. Seven of the 23 crew have been released, but the ship remains in Iranian hands. The Iranian Foreign Office at the weekend said the ship would be released soon, but in the complex Iranian government, the writ of the Iranian Foreign Office is not sacrosanct. From the British perspective the episode has made the UK look naive in the eyes of the US administration for even taking the Iranians\u2019 words seriously. The now departed US national security adviser John Bolton openly mocked the British for being in denial about the true nature of Iran. British advocates of dialogue, such as Burt, say Tehran does not seem to understand the value of a unilateral gesture on issues such as releasing hostages, or how it could unlock something different. From the Iranian perspective, the catalogue of British failings is equally long. Grace 1, the Iranian ship, should never have been impounded since Iran is not obliged to follow an EU sanctions regime. The UK government has spent close on 30 years, and millions in legal costs, in refusing to pay the debt courts say it owes to Iran for the sale of Chieftain tanks. Above all Europeans, including Britain, talk a big game about the need for European sovereignty, but faced with an overweening US administration imposing sanctions on anyone that trades with Iran, the EU has proved powerless, and says the effectiveness of such sanctions is a necessary by-product of the dollar\u2019s ubiquity as a trading currency. The bigger question is whether the departure of Bolton will, as hoped, reveal an opening in the cul-de-sac that is western-European relations. Burt, speaking to the Lords international relations committee last week, made the point that if Trump has decided not to go to war with Iran, as he appeared to when he did not retaliate for the downing of a US drone by Iran, the logical step must be to talk Tehran. Emmanuel Macron, the French president, has been trying to create the detailed circumstances for this to occur. The US administration said again that Trump was willing to hold a summit with the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, at the UN general assembly in New York this month. But for these high-profile \u201clook me in the eye\u201d summits to work, or for there to be any relenting on US sanctions, the ground debris has to be cleared. Issues like impounded ships, broken promises and hostage-taking have to be addressed. At the moment, there is no sign that is happening. If anything the thicket of disagreements is only becoming more dense.",

      "bodyText": "Visitors to Treasure Cay in the Bahamas used to enjoy a traditional dish of steamed grouper with jasmine rice and coleslaw prepared by executive chef Antone Dames. \u201cI\u2019d do anything for that now,\u201d Dames said, contemplating whether he has a long-term future here. The 40-year-old and his family were in their condominium last week when Hurricane Dorian tore into Abaco Island with fearful velocity. He recalled: \u201cAt about three or four in the afternoon, the bottom window blew out and the wind tried to pull my family outside. I was holding my wife\u2019s hand and she was holding our son\u2019s hand; they were off their feet and in the air for at least 10 minutes. My arm still hurts. We went to the bathroom and the whole roof came off. I was as scared as hell. I thought I was going to die.\u201d The Italian bistro that Dames opened last year was destroyed by the storm and now he does not know what his future holds \u2013 or where it will be. \u201cWe put a lot of work into it and it\u2019s gone, just like that. Now I\u2019m going to start my whole life over. Start at the bottom,\u201d he said. His wife, Martha, 40, took their traumatized 11-year-old son Antwoine to Nassau, the Bahamian capital. But on Tuesday Dames was at the local airport awaiting delivery of supplies including food, water and batteries. He said there is a plan to rebuild Treasure Cay, but he is waiting to see what terms he is offered before making a decision. Twenty miles north of Abaco\u2019s biggest town, Marsh Harbour, Treasure Cay boasts a luxury resort with a beach rated one of the best in the world. The rich own second homes here and there are golf courses and tennis courts. One tennis net is twisted but still up and many beachfront villas survived Dorian relatively unscathed. It is still possible to stand on their decks overlooking the turquoise ocean and imagine paradise. But as another planeload of people departed Treasure Cay\u2019s modest airport, the daunting, multi-year, multibillion-dollar challenge of how to rebuild \u2013 and even whether to rebuild \u2013 Abaco and other affected Bahamian islands is looming large. Jim Keady, an American volunteering for the Humanitarian Aid and Rescue Project, said: \u201cThis is just as bad as any war zone that one might see. Everywhere you walk into communities that were hardest hit, you can smell death.\u201d Travelling with the NGO Team Rubicon UK on Tuesday, the Guardian witnessed how a major bridge had collapsed into an inlet, plunging giant chunks of concrete below water and twisting steel barriers out of shape. In the surrounding area vehicles have been spun upside down, trees broken like twigs and power cables snapped. Speaking at the Cooper\u2019s Town community clinic, Keady, 47, commented: \u201cThe infrastructure is completely clobbered. All the electricity has gone, the water\u2019s gone and the other thing is that the people are gone. You have so many people who have left the island that we now have another wave of climate refugees. \u201cI did a ride around yesterday with one of the top guys at the ministry of works here just processing what will need to be done: the amount of front-end loaders, bulldozers, mulching machines, cranes. There\u2019s going to have to be some really difficult decisions made by the central government here in the Bahamas on whether or not you rebuild. From what I have seen, you\u2019ve just got to bulldoze a lot of these neighbourhoods and then decide, are we going to rebuild something here?\u201d Keady suggested that the situation will become unsustainable for residents in seven to 10 days, especially if aid dries up, making evacuation the only option. \u201cI just came from the airport in Treasure Cay. A plane landed, we were unloading medical supplies and there were people running up with their passports begging to get on a plane to anywhere in Florida. And you have to tell them no. It breaks your heart. You\u2019ve got a mother in tears crying for herself and her son, \u2018I just want to get him out of here.\u2019 This is the reality facing people here.\u201d Keady, who has been involved in local politics in New Jersey, insisted that global heating was a crucial factor in the category 5 hurricane. \u201cThe surface temperatures of the water are so much higher than they would have been and that\u2019s just fuel for storms that in the past would have moved along and did some damage. We had a storm stall for two days, crushing the Bahamas,\u201d he said. \u201cDonald Trump is a fool with regard to the climate crisis. You don\u2019t have to be a climate scientist; you just need to be paying attention and looking at what is happening.\u201d Although much of Abaco is eerily deserted, and the Treasure Cay community centre lies dark and silent with rows of books and a calendar frozen in August, there is a slow trickle of people into the next door medical centre, where volunteers from Heart to Heart International are providing free treatment. Wilson Charite, 61, who came to the clinic because of his blood pressure, said of the hurricane: \u201cMy house was flooded. The water broke the front door and carried everything out. We had one little ladder inside so we put all the children on the roof. \u201cEveryone was crying. I said: \u2018Don\u2019t cry, the roof isn\u2019t going to go away.\u2019 I thought, if the roof goes, all my children will be lost.\u201d His daughter, Wilsonithe, 14, added: \u201cWe were on the roof for a night. The house was shaking. It was like the house was going to tumble over. I felt like I was going to die.\u201d Clint Laroda, 60, required attention to his hand after trying to ride out the storm in a beach club. \u201cI was opening the door to get my family out and the hurricane slammed the door and amputated the tip of my finger,\u201d he said. But he remains optimistic about the future of Treasure Cay. \u201cI think it can be rebuilt. I\u2019m a builder, so I\u2019m not going to say no.\u201d In nearby Cooper\u2019s Town, a roadside sign says innocently: \u201cWe hope your stay was a very pleasant one.\u201d A church, library and school appear to have emerged relatively unscathed. Anthony Saunders, 58, who was fixing up his convenience store and petrol station, said he was hopeful the town water supply would be switched on tomorrow. \u201cThey\u2019re good people here. They\u2019re resilient. It will take time but it will come back.\u201d \u2022 Team Rubicon UK are working with local agencies in the Bahamas and delivering aid supplies to Abaco and Grand Bahama.",

Two hours after the Scottish appeal court ruled that Boris Johnson\u2019s advice to the Queen to suspend parliament was \u201cunlawful\u201d, three of the most senior English judges explained why they had come to a diametrically opposed conclusion. Last week, the lord chief justice, Lord Burnett of Maldon, the master of the rolls, Sir Terence Etherton, and the president of the Queen\u2019s bench division, Dame Victoria Sharp, dismissed the challenge by the legal campaigner and businesswoman Gina Miller. On Wednesday, the judges gave the full reasons for that decision in a 24-page judgment, which concluded with sentence: \u201cIn our view, the decision of the prime minister to advise Her Majesty the Queen to prorogue parliament is not justiciable in Her Majesty\u2019s courts.\u201d The judges said: \u201cThe refusal of the courts to review political questions is well established \u2026 The prime minister\u2019s decision that parliament should be prorogued at the time and for the duration chosen and the advice given to Her Majesty to do so in the present case were political.

      "bodyText": "Scottish appeal court judges have declared Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament in the run-up to the October Brexit deadline is unlawful. The three judges, chaired by Lord Carloway, Scotland\u2019s most senior judge, overturned an earlier ruling that the courts did not have the power to interfere in the prime minister\u2019s political decision to prorogue parliament. Lawyers acting for 75 opposition MPs and peers argued Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament for five weeks was illegal and in breach of the constitution, as it was designed to stifle parliamentary debate and action on Brexit. The judges failed to issue an interdict, or injunction, ordering the UK government to reconvene parliament, prompting a row over whether the decision meant MPs could go back to the House of Commons. The court issued an official summary of its decision declaring the prorogation order was \u201cnull and of no effect\u201d, but Carloway said the judges were deferring a final decision on an interdict to the UK supreme court, which will hold a three-day hearing next week. Jolyon Maugham QC, the legal campaigner whose Good Law Project funded the legal action, said he and Aidan O\u2019Neill QC, the group\u2019s lawyer, believed this meant prorogation was suspended with immediate effect unless the UK government won a court order reinstating it. The UK government will appeal at the UK supreme court against the latest ruling, which also contradicts a decision in Johnson\u2019s favour by senior English judges last week. The UK supreme court has already scheduled an emergency hearing on both the Scottish and English cases for 17 September, alongside a third challenge brought in the courts in Belfast. The three Scottish judges, who will issue their reasonings in full on Friday, said unanimously the prorogation was unlawful \u201cbecause it had the purpose of stymying parliament\u201d. Carloway, the lord president of the court of session \u2013 the supreme civil court of Scotland \u2013 said parliamentary scrutiny of the executive was \u201ca central pillar of the good governance principle enshrined in the constitution\u201d. Lord Brodie said that attempting to frustrate parliament in this way was \u201can egregious case of a clear failure to comply with generally accepted standards of behaviour of public authorities\u201d. The court\u2019s summary concluded that Johnson\u2019s prorogation request to the Queen and her decision to accept it \u201cwas unlawful and is thus null and of no effect\u201d. Maugham said: \u201cOur understanding is that unless the supreme court grants an order in the meantime, parliament is unsuspended with immediate effect. \u201cI\u2019m relieved that my understanding of the functioning of our democracy \u2013 that allows parliament to exercise its vital constitutional role \u2013 has been vindicated by Scotland\u2019s highest court. \u201cThis is an incredibly important point of principle. The prime minister mustn\u2019t treat parliament as an inconvenience.\u201d Joanna Cherry QC, the Scottish National party MP who was the lead applicant in the case, called for prorogation to be halted. \u201cThe court agreed it is unlawful to suspend the UK parliament for the specific purpose of preventing parliament from scrutinising the Brexit process and holding this shambolic Tory government\u2019s extreme Brexit plans to account,\u201d she said. \u201cThis ruling takes us one step closer to ensuring the UK government cancels their shameful prorogation and blatant plot to force through an extreme Brexit.

However, calls quickly grew among opposition parties for Johnson to act now to restore sitting for the House of Commons and Lords.

Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.</p>\n    <p>Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are \u201cfanning the fire\u201d of unrest in the city.

The \u201cBasic Law\u201d constitution guarantees to protect, for the next 50 years, the democratic institutions that make&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;distinct from Communist-ruled mainland China.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2003:&nbsp;</b>Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s leaders introduce legislation that would forbid acts of treason and subversion against the Chinese government. The bill resembles laws used to charge dissidents on the mainland. An estimated half a million people turn out to protest against the bill. As a result of the backlash, further action on the proposal is halted.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2007:&nbsp;</b>The Basic Law stated that the ultimate aim was for&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s voters to achieve a complete democracy, but China decides in 2007 that universal suffrage in elections for the chief executive cannot be implemented until 2017. Some lawmakers are chosen by business and trade groups, while others are elected by vote. In a bid to accelerate a decision on universal suffrage, five lawmakers resign. But this act is followed by the adoption of the Beijing-backed electoral changes, which expand the chief executive\u2019s selection committee and add more seats for lawmakers elected by direct vote. The legislation divides Hong&nbsp;Kong's pro-democracy camp, as some support the reforms while others say they will only delay full democracy while reinforcing a structure that favors Beijing.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2014:&nbsp;</b>The Chinese government introduces a bill allowing Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;residents to vote for their leader in 2017, but with one major caveat: the candidates must be approved by Beijing. Pro-democracy lawmakers are incensed by the bill, which they call an example of \u201cfake universal suffrage\u201d and \u201cfake democracy\u201d. The move triggers a massive protest as crowds occupy some of&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s most crowded districts for 70 days. In June 2015,&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;legislators formally reject the bill, and electoral reform stalls. The current chief executive, Carrie Lam, widely seen as the Chinese Communist party\u2019s favoured candidate, is hand-picked in 2017 by a 1,200-person committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2019:&nbsp;</b>Lam pushes amendments to extradition laws that would allow people to be sent to mainland China to face charges. The proposed legislation triggers a huge protest, with organisers putting the turnout at 1 million, and a standoff that forces the legislature to postpone debate on the bills. After weeks of protest, often meeting with violent reprisals from the Hong Kong police, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/04/hong-kong-lam-to-withdraw-extradition-bill-say-reports\">Lam announced that she would withdraw the bill</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cNext time I come to visit Berlin, it would be great to have the chance to meet with anyone from the office of the foreign minister, or even the chancellor.\u201d Merkel was criticised in parliament on Wednesday morning for failing to arrange a meeting with the protest leader.</p> \n<p>Wong will meet US media in New York on Friday and move on to Washington next week, where he is seeking to lobby Democratic and Republican politicians to support the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which would require the US government to regularly reassess Hong Kong\u2019s level of political autonomy to determine whether it should continue to have a special trade status.</p> \n<p>In Berlin, Wong said he hoped to carry his pro-democracy message even to China: \u201cFirst is Hong Kong, next is mainland China.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cWe hope for more and more people who live in mainland China to recognise the importance of universal values and freedom.

      "body": "<p>The performance of the north\u2019s two main rail operators is worse than it was a year ago in the aftermath of the timetable chaos that affected thousands of passengers, a report has found.</p> <p>The reliability of both Northern and TransPennine rail services has fallen sharply in the last two years and worsened gradually over the last few months, according to the <a href=\"https://transportforthenorth.com/wp-content/uploads/9.0-RNC-120919-RNC-Performance-Report-DRAFT.pdf\">study by Transport for the North</a>.</p> <p>Rail officials said services had been hit particularly hard by severe weather events such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/09/disaster-tourism-arrives-in-whaley-bridge-after-dam-incident\">flooding in the Derbyshire town of Whaley Bridge</a>, train failures and cancellations caused by a lack of staff.</p> <p>Tom Davidson, a transport planner for Transport for the North, said the worsening services was a \u201csignificant concern\u201d going into autumn, when demand traditionally increases and fallen leaves can cause delays.</p> <p>He said passenger crowding was also a worry for rail officials, with an estimated 114 passengers a day unable to board Northern services because of overcrowding.</p> <p>The report, published before a Transport for the North rail committee meeting on Thursday, will increase calls for an overhaul of Britain\u2019s ageing rail network.</p> <p>Northern leaders and businesses have urged the government to commit fully to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/03/hs2-to-be-delayed-by-up-to-five-years\">vastly delayed and over-budget HS2</a> rail line and to Northern Powerhouse Rail, a high-speed rail link that would speed up journey times between Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, Sheffield, Hull and Newcastle.</p> <p>On a visit to Yorkshire last week, Boris Johnson said he was committing \u00a39bn \u2013 \u201c<a href=\"https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/politics/i-have-bought-the-argument-that-north-needs-hs2-and-northern-powerhouse-rail-says-boris-johnson-1-9981709\">a huge slug of money</a>\u201d \u2013 to connecting the big cities of the north with Northern Powerhouse Rail. However, the prime minister was lukewarm about HS2. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/aug/21/hs2-review-launched-over-whether-rail-project-should-proceed\">review of the plans</a>, commissioned by the government, is due to be published next month.</p> <p>Manuel Cortes, the general secretary of the rail staff union TSSA, said: \u201cThe findings of this report should come as no surprise to anyone. Northern, TransPennine and many other franchises are failing day in, day out. If we had a government that cared a hoot about putting passengers before profit our railways would be brought back under public control right now. The evidence for doing so is compelling \u2013 look no further than this report.\u201d</p> <p>The report found the number of TransPennine trains running on time had fallen to 70.9% from 75.7% a year ago and <a href=\"https://transportforthenorth.com/wp-content/uploads/Item-4-Rail-Performance.pdf\">89.6% in August 2017</a>.

      "bodyText": "The performance of the north\u2019s two main rail operators is worse than it was a year ago in the aftermath of the timetable chaos that affected thousands of passengers, a report has found. The reliability of both Northern and TransPennine rail services has fallen sharply in the last two years and worsened gradually over the last few months, according to the study by Transport for the North. Rail officials said services had been hit particularly hard by severe weather events such as flooding in the Derbyshire town of Whaley Bridge, train failures and cancellations caused by a lack of staff. Tom Davidson, a transport planner for Transport for the North, said the worsening services was a \u201csignificant concern\u201d going into autumn, when demand traditionally increases and fallen leaves can cause delays. He said passenger crowding was also a worry for rail officials, with an estimated 114 passengers a day unable to board Northern services because of overcrowding. The report, published before a Transport for the North rail committee meeting on Thursday, will increase calls for an overhaul of Britain\u2019s ageing rail network. Northern leaders and businesses have urged the government to commit fully to the vastly delayed and over-budget HS2 rail line and to Northern Powerhouse Rail, a high-speed rail link that would speed up journey times between Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, Sheffield, Hull and Newcastle. On a visit to Yorkshire last week, Boris Johnson said he was committing \u00a39bn \u2013 \u201ca huge slug of money\u201d \u2013 to connecting the big cities of the north with Northern Powerhouse Rail. However, the prime minister was lukewarm about HS2. A review of the plans, commissioned by the government, is due to be published next month. Manuel Cortes, the general secretary of the rail staff union TSSA, said: \u201cThe findings of this report should come as no surprise to anyone. Northern, TransPennine and many other franchises are failing day in, day out. If we had a government that cared a hoot about putting passengers before profit our railways would be brought back under public control right now. The evidence for doing so is compelling \u2013 look no further than this report.\u201d The report found the number of TransPennine trains running on time had fallen to 70.9% from 75.7% a year ago and 89.6% in August 2017. For Northern, the number of trains running on time averaged 79.4% this August, compared with 82.2% in May 2018 and 91.2% in August 2017. A spokesperson for TransPennine Express said: \u201cLast month our customers experienced some disruption to their journeys. This was due to a number of factors, the most significant being weather events such as flooding and extreme heat. Performance has improved this month and we are working hard to ensure that we continue to provide the best possible service for our customers.\u201d A Northern spokesman claimed its performance had been \u201csteadily improving over the past 12 months\u201d, but added: \u201cWe know there is more to do, and our customers were impacted over the summer by extreme weather causing flooding and damage to overhead lines and disruption to many rail services across the country. \u201cNorthern is delivering the biggest transformation of local rail for a generation, with 18 of our 101 new trains already in service and driver training on a further 20 trains taking place right now.\u201d",

In Anchar, posters of fighters are pasted across shuttered shops. \u201cDon\u2019t call them militants,\u201d a young man said. \u201cThey are mujahideen, they fight for our cause.\u201d Many believe these fighters are their only source of hope in the wake of Delhi\u2019s decision. The Indian government has said its actions will rid the state of terrorism and bring development. It maintains that the situation remains calm. \u201cThey say things are normal. What normalcy is this?\u201d said Subhan. \u201cThey have shut our main mosques. Jamia Masjid is locked. If this is just the beginning, what will they do afterwards?\u201d He said he would continue to take part in the night watch. \u201cAnchar is fighting for all of Kashmir,\u201d he said. At night-time, groups of youths are stationed along routes into the city. \u201cWhen the alarm is raised, everyone comes to defend this place,\u201d a college student said at his home where he was recovering from pellet injuries. More than 100 pellets were lodged in his body, neck and head, he said. \u201cIt was very painful. When I was hit it was like a hundred needles had pricked me.\u201d Khatija, his mother, said her heart trembled every night as she feared another raid. \u201cGod should now have mercy on us,\u201d she said. Khatija\u2019s elder son, a 24-year-old shawl weaver who regularly attends the night guard, said people came out of their houses \u201clike bees\u201d when the alarm of an incoming raid was raised. \u201cWe are like one family here, like a folded hand,\u201d he said. He described Anchar\u2019s resistance as a \u201cfight for existence\u201d, adding: \u201cWe are fighting for haqq [truth], we are fighting for azadi [freedom].\u201d He added: \u201cThey want to erase us, they want to erase our history. We will not let that happen.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A campaign to advertise the return of limited duty-free shopping when visiting EU countries in the event of a no-deal Brexit has attracted criticism and mockery on social media. The chancellor, Sajid Javid, announced passengers travelling to the EU in a no-deal scenario would not have to pay UK excise duties on cigarettes and alcohol purchased in airports, and the Treasury posted on social media in support of the change, but immediately ran into a negative reaction. The campaign has been \u201cratioed\u201d on Twitter \u2013 a term for when a post has many more comments mocking it than it has retweets or likes. But rather than just the usual series of jokes and memes, users raised a consistent set of objections to the proposal \u2013 not least that it is at odds with the government\u2019s stated policies on discouraging drinking and smoking. Given the revelations in the leaked Operation Yellowhammer documents that the government expected there to be interruptions to the food supply and medicine shortages in the event of a no-deal Brexit, some wondered whether HM Treasury had got its priorities right. There were also questions about whether the government had inadvertently breached one of its own laws by promoting cheaper cigarettes. The Tobacco Advertising and Promotion Act 2002 states: \u201cA person who in the course of a business publishes a tobacco advertisement, or causes one to be published, in the United Kingdom is guilty of an offence.\u201d Several people pointed out that since parliament had legislated this week to rule out a no-deal Brexit, the government was promoting a scenario that could only come about if it disregarded the law. Other users raised the issue of the UK border with Ireland, pointing out that if the government were insisting that in a no-deal scenario it would not be checking goods at the border, this move to significantly lower the price of alcohol and cigarettes at airports in Northern Ireland would likely make the prospect of smuggling more attractive. And even pubs in the UK were puzzled as to why the Treasury was spending money to advertise it. The announcement of the limited reintroduction of duty-free shopping to EU destinations marked a change of tone from government communications around no-deal planning, as it was the first advert to suggest a specific positive outcome of leaving the EU without a withdrawal agreement. On the whole though, reaction on social media suggested duty-free shopping was more of a silver lining than a great tangible benefit. It is not the only social media mishap to result from the government\u2019s Brexit advertising this week. The Cabinet Office\u2019s \u201cGet ready for Brexit\u201d paid social media adverts have been using the same animated video on both Facebook and Twitter, leading Twitter users to be urged by the government to tap on a \u201cLearn more\u201d button that does not exist on that platform.",

I entered the water with the last priority [on a] borrowed board and needing a combination of 12 points to advance. So far everything was going \u2018OK\u2019 because I \u2018just\u2019 needed to surf and do what I love most in a short time. Looking back, I had everything to go wrong with so much going on, but I always had hope until the end. This for me was a story of overcoming, even though it is a championship that does not \u2018count\u2019 for the classification of the Olympics because I am seeking my classification by the WSL ranking. I had to be in Japan otherwise I missed the chance and could make myself [ineligible] to the job.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The first time I heard pizza described as a bread, my mind melted like mozzarella in a wood-fired oven \u2013 yet underneath the toppings it is, of course, part of the same global family of yeast-raised loaves as naan, pitta, and our own white bloomers. None of these relatives, however, arouse such strong feelings as pizza, something nearer to a religion than a mere bread, with cults devoted to the worship and defence of its various incarnations \u2013 woe betide the person who wanders into a temple of the Neapolitan pie and asks for a ham and pineapple, or indeed the fool who demands a thin and crispy base in old-school Chicago.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/may/27/rachel-roddy-recipe-pizza-cherry-tomatoes-mozzarella-parmesan\">Rachel Roddy\u2019s recipe for pizza | A kitchen in Rome</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The one thing most fanatics can agree on, however, is that it\u2019s impossible to make a \u201cproper pizza\u201d at home \u2013 you can\u2019t get a home oven up to the searing temperatures of a commercial appliance, whether wood-fired or not. Less obsessive disciples can, however, knock-up a pretty decent facsimile, either by heating their oven for hours and faffing around with baking stones, or by sticking a frying pan on the hob. The choice is yours.</p> <h2>The flour</h2> <p>The fact that this is a bread should give you a clue as to the best type of flour to use. You <em>can </em>make pizza with plain flour, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/dec/14/cooking-science-baking-j-kenji-lopez-alt-tamal-ray-cooks-cook\" title=\"\">J Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\u2019</a>s recipe on the <a href=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/\" title=\"\">Serious Eats</a> website recommends. (Though he himself prefers \u201cfancy\u201d Italian flour, he says the differences are marginal enough for it not to be a necessity.) But, because a good base is chewy and bubbly, rather than flat and crunchy, a higher protein flour is a better bet. This is because the higher the protein content, the more gluten will develop in the dough. This much-maligned matrix is the thing that gives dough its elasticity, allowing it to stretch into beautiful big, blistered bubbles in the oven, rather than staying resolutely solid, like one of those boxed supermarket pizza bases that passed for authentic in the 1980s, but now resemble nothing more than a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bath_Oliver\" title=\"\">Bath Oliver</a> biscuit.</p> <p>Which is all to say that higher protein flours, like the strong bread flour used by Olivia Potts in her book <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/half-baked-idea-9780241380451.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">A Half-Baked Idea,</a> or the 00 flour often sold as pasta flour in British supermarkets are a better choice. The latter is particularly good because it\u2019s so finely milled (00 refers to the grade), which makes for a particularly delicate, crisp crust.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c7db59fea5f5641bf1f8e4c8f8333dc019a1a3e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7db59fea5f5641bf1f8e4c8f8333dc019a1a3e6/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sainsbury\u2019s magazine\u2019s version frying-pan pizza uses herby 00 flour.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sainsbury\u2019s magazine\u2019s version uses a herby, 00 flour-based dough.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Note that if you use bread flour, or indeed plain flour, you may want to add a little more water: the very fine texture means that you need less \u2013 Lopez-Alt\u2019s recipe comes in at 75% hydration (the weight of water being 75% that of the weight of flour) and Potts\u2019 70%, while the two I try using 00 flour, from <a href=\"https://www.francomanca.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Franco Manca</a> founder <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/sep/21/restaurants.foodanddrink1\" title=\"\">Giuseppe Mascoli </a>and that of the <a href=\"https://www.pizzapilgrims.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Pizza Pilgrims</a>, call for 59% and 60% hydration respectively. (More water makes the dough harder to work with, but also makes the finished product lighter and bubblier; I think we\u2019ve already established we\u2019re all about the bubbles here).</p> <h2>The raising agents</h2> <p>Let\u2019s be honest: we all dream of homemade pizza that\u2019s quicker than a takeaway, so I decide to try a recipe from Sainsbury\u2019s magazine using baking powder, rather than the traditional yeast, leaving it to rest for a mere 30 minutes before baking. The results, though not unpleasant, are more like a pitta than a pizza \u2013 great if you have a lot of hungry and fairly indiscriminate mouths to feed in a hurry, but not one for the pizza aficionado.</p> <p>Leaving aside sourdough pizzas, which are a whole different kettle of anchovies, there\u2019s no substitute for yeast, and yeast takes time to work its magic; how much is an interesting matter. The recipes I try range from a 10-hour rise and proof as the minimum for L\u00f3pez-Alt\u2019s recipe, to a five-day rise for Potts\u2019 pizza, with the Pizza Pilgrims describing 24 hours as \u201coptimal\u201d. The difference is largely due to the fact that Potts\u2019 and Mascoli\u2019s doughs both rise in the fridge, in a process known as cold fermentation. This slows the action of the yeast, but gives the finished product a better flavour and texture (apparently cold fermentation results in stronger gluten networks). You\u2019ll need to bring it back to room temperature before shaping and cooking, but in this instance, patience is very much a virtue: if you want a truly complex flavour, you need to plan ahead.</p> <p>Not too far ahead though; L\u00f3pez-Alt has done some interesting research on this very subject, and concludes that a rise time of between three and five days is optimal: \u201cEventually, even at cold temperatures, the yeast will start to produce a large amount of those sour milk aromas, throwing off the flavour of your bread. And there\u2019s an even bigger problem: as the alcohol content and acidity of the dough rises, eventually it gets so high that the yeast simply ceases to operate.\u201d</p> <p>I reckon three days is plenty, but that may be because I find it very hard to wait any longer for my pizza.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d6080a7d6c06d9456bc5dd722397124d2989f79d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6080a7d6c06d9456bc5dd722397124d2989f79d/0_0_3024_4032/750.jpg\" alt=\"Giuseppe Mascoli\u2019s pizza is deep-fried, and unfortunately that means it is delicious.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Franco Manca founder Giuseppe Mascoli deep-fries his pizza \u2013 with delicious results.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The flavouring</h2> <p>Salt is a must in pizza dough and, though it\u2019s frowned upon by purists, I\u2019m not too snooty to add a little sugar to help the yeast along and give a more complex flavour, though you can leave it out if you prefer. While olive oil gives a pleasing flavour, it also softens the texture, so I\u2019m not going to use it \u2013 and I\u2019d prefer to save herbs for the top, rather than adding them to the dough, as Sainsbury\u2019s suggest.</p> <h2>The method</h2> <p>The most important thing I learn, very belatedly, is that a cast-iron pan is the best tool for cooking pizza on the hob: nonstick pans are out for safety reasons, and my stainless -steel pan turned out some great pizza, but at the expense of its shiny silver base. The cast-iron skillet recommended by Potts, however, produces perfect results: if you have one, use it.</p> <p>You don\u2019t need to grease it, unless you\u2019re actually deep-frying the pizzas, as in Mascoli\u2019s recipe \u2013 and I\u2019m sorry to report these are excessively good). Just get it good and hot, though not so hot it burns the base before it cooks through \u2013 you might need to experiment a bit with the first batch to find out what works for your pan.</p> <p>L\u00f3pez-Alt, in a quest to eliminate the need for an oven entirely, recommends cooking the dough on both sides with a lid on, and then browning the crust by turning it in a gas flame, or with a blowtorch. This works well if you don\u2019t happen to have a grill, but it\u2019s much easier, and I think better texture-wise, to char the bottom on the hob and then transfer it to a hot grill to brown the top, and to melt any cheese. (Make sure your toppings are at room temperature as Lopez-Alt cautions, or they will take too long to warm up).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"45fcb5a0cce123a531ebb9d8e41a18cba07f4dc8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45fcb5a0cce123a531ebb9d8e41a18cba07f4dc8/0_0_3024_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Twenty-four hours is sufficient to produce a dough for this, Pizza Pilgrim\u2019s pizza.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A 24-hour prove is sufficient to get Pizza Pilgrims\u2019 dough ready for cooking.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The toppings</h2> <p>On which point, I\u2019m happy for you to top your pizza with whatever you like, even chicken (the horror), but all the recipes I try call for a classic mozzarella and tomato combo, often with a few leaves of basil, or \u201cif you\u2019re feeling truly nostalgic\u201d, as Potts puts it, a sprinkling of dried oregano. She also makes a buttery, garlicky, oniony sauce, a \u201cbastardisation\u201d of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/marcella-hazan\" title=\"\">Marcella Hazan </a>recipe so delicious, I eat it with a spoon, but it feels like gilding the lily here: Mascoli\u2019s simple simmered tomatoes, with a pinch of salt and sugar, give a purer tomato hit.

      "bodyText": "The first time I heard pizza described as a bread, my mind melted like mozzarella in a wood-fired oven \u2013 yet underneath the toppings it is, of course, part of the same global family of yeast-raised loaves as naan, pitta, and our own white bloomers. None of these relatives, however, arouse such strong feelings as pizza, something nearer to a religion than a mere bread, with cults devoted to the worship and defence of its various incarnations \u2013 woe betide the person who wanders into a temple of the Neapolitan pie and asks for a ham and pineapple, or indeed the fool who demands a thin and crispy base in old-school Chicago. The one thing most fanatics can agree on, however, is that it\u2019s impossible to make a \u201cproper pizza\u201d at home \u2013 you can\u2019t get a home oven up to the searing temperatures of a commercial appliance, whether wood-fired or not. Less obsessive disciples can, however, knock-up a pretty decent facsimile, either by heating their oven for hours and faffing around with baking stones, or by sticking a frying pan on the hob. The choice is yours. The flour The fact that this is a bread should give you a clue as to the best type of flour to use. You can make pizza with plain flour, as J Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\u2019s recipe on the Serious Eats website recommends. (Though he himself prefers \u201cfancy\u201d Italian flour, he says the differences are marginal enough for it not to be a necessity.) But, because a good base is chewy and bubbly, rather than flat and crunchy, a higher protein flour is a better bet. This is because the higher the protein content, the more gluten will develop in the dough. This much-maligned matrix is the thing that gives dough its elasticity, allowing it to stretch into beautiful big, blistered bubbles in the oven, rather than staying resolutely solid, like one of those boxed supermarket pizza bases that passed for authentic in the 1980s, but now resemble nothing more than a Bath Oliver biscuit. Which is all to say that higher protein flours, like the strong bread flour used by Olivia Potts in her book A Half-Baked Idea, or the 00 flour often sold as pasta flour in British supermarkets are a better choice. The latter is particularly good because it\u2019s so finely milled (00 refers to the grade), which makes for a particularly delicate, crisp crust. Note that if you use bread flour, or indeed plain flour, you may want to add a little more water: the very fine texture means that you need less \u2013 Lopez-Alt\u2019s recipe comes in at 75% hydration (the weight of water being 75% that of the weight of flour) and Potts\u2019 70%, while the two I try using 00 flour, from Franco Manca founder Giuseppe Mascoli and that of the Pizza Pilgrims, call for 59% and 60% hydration respectively. (More water makes the dough harder to work with, but also makes the finished product lighter and bubblier; I think we\u2019ve already established we\u2019re all about the bubbles here). The raising agents Let\u2019s be honest: we all dream of homemade pizza that\u2019s quicker than a takeaway, so I decide to try a recipe from Sainsbury\u2019s magazine using baking powder, rather than the traditional yeast, leaving it to rest for a mere 30 minutes before baking. The results, though not unpleasant, are more like a pitta than a pizza \u2013 great if you have a lot of hungry and fairly indiscriminate mouths to feed in a hurry, but not one for the pizza aficionado. Leaving aside sourdough pizzas, which are a whole different kettle of anchovies, there\u2019s no substitute for yeast, and yeast takes time to work its magic; how much is an interesting matter. The recipes I try range from a 10-hour rise and proof as the minimum for L\u00f3pez-Alt\u2019s recipe, to a five-day rise for Potts\u2019 pizza, with the Pizza Pilgrims describing 24 hours as \u201coptimal\u201d. The difference is largely due to the fact that Potts\u2019 and Mascoli\u2019s doughs both rise in the fridge, in a process known as cold fermentation. This slows the action of the yeast, but gives the finished product a better flavour and texture (apparently cold fermentation results in stronger gluten networks). You\u2019ll need to bring it back to room temperature before shaping and cooking, but in this instance, patience is very much a virtue: if you want a truly complex flavour, you need to plan ahead. Not too far ahead though; L\u00f3pez-Alt has done some interesting research on this very subject, and concludes that a rise time of between three and five days is optimal: \u201cEventually, even at cold temperatures, the yeast will start to produce a large amount of those sour milk aromas, throwing off the flavour of your bread. And there\u2019s an even bigger problem: as the alcohol content and acidity of the dough rises, eventually it gets so high that the yeast simply ceases to operate.\u201d I reckon three days is plenty, but that may be because I find it very hard to wait any longer for my pizza. The flavouring Salt is a must in pizza dough and, though it\u2019s frowned upon by purists, I\u2019m not too snooty to add a little sugar to help the yeast along and give a more complex flavour, though you can leave it out if you prefer. While olive oil gives a pleasing flavour, it also softens the texture, so I\u2019m not going to use it \u2013 and I\u2019d prefer to save herbs for the top, rather than adding them to the dough, as Sainsbury\u2019s suggest. The method The most important thing I learn, very belatedly, is that a cast-iron pan is the best tool for cooking pizza on the hob: nonstick pans are out for safety reasons, and my stainless -steel pan turned out some great pizza, but at the expense of its shiny silver base. The cast-iron skillet recommended by Potts, however, produces perfect results: if you have one, use it. You don\u2019t need to grease it, unless you\u2019re actually deep-frying the pizzas, as in Mascoli\u2019s recipe \u2013 and I\u2019m sorry to report these are excessively good). Just get it good and hot, though not so hot it burns the base before it cooks through \u2013 you might need to experiment a bit with the first batch to find out what works for your pan. L\u00f3pez-Alt, in a quest to eliminate the need for an oven entirely, recommends cooking the dough on both sides with a lid on, and then browning the crust by turning it in a gas flame, or with a blowtorch. This works well if you don\u2019t happen to have a grill, but it\u2019s much easier, and I think better texture-wise, to char the bottom on the hob and then transfer it to a hot grill to brown the top, and to melt any cheese. (Make sure your toppings are at room temperature as Lopez-Alt cautions, or they will take too long to warm up). The toppings On which point, I\u2019m happy for you to top your pizza with whatever you like, even chicken (the horror), but all the recipes I try call for a classic mozzarella and tomato combo, often with a few leaves of basil, or \u201cif you\u2019re feeling truly nostalgic\u201d, as Potts puts it, a sprinkling of dried oregano. She also makes a buttery, garlicky, oniony sauce, a \u201cbastardisation\u201d of a Marcella Hazan recipe so delicious, I eat it with a spoon, but it feels like gilding the lily here: Mascoli\u2019s simple simmered tomatoes, with a pinch of salt and sugar, give a purer tomato hit. He explains his topping is oil-free because the pizzette will be deep-fried, but in fact I prefer it even for dry-fried pizzas; you can always drizzle some oil on top before serving. Cheese-wise, you can\u2019t beat buffalo mozzarella (note: if you want to use firmer pizza mozzarella, you may need to deploy a blowtorch to help it melt, because it will take longer than the wetter stuff). Sainsbury\u2019s also add parmesan, roasted peppers and cherry tomatoes, but, a few herbs aside, I don\u2019t think it needs anything else for perfection. Eat immediately, and certainly fast enough to burn your tongue: it\u2019s worth it.

The beacons enable connection with funding bodies, industrial partners, charities and policy makers, and can align with their agendas and funding streams.\u201d</p> <p>Having six very clearly defined areas also enables better collaboration across the globe. Corner points out that no single institution can do everything. \u201cWe have great people, across a huge range of disciplines.

It brings a global community of experts together \u2013 from geographers to historians and statisticians \u2013 and has already achieved significant success in a wide variety of areas, via many different tools. Dr Doreen Boyd\u2019s work with Google Earth satellite imagery, for example, exposed modern slavery sites in south Asia, while Dr Alexander Trautrims examines the role of slavery in supply chains associated with car washes, the care sector and construction. How to feed a growing population is one of the most urgent questions facing the world today. The Future Food beacon research strand draws heavily on the university\u2019s existing expertise, drawing in top talent from a variety of fields. Nottingham is one of just a few UK universities that has a farm and a School of Veterinary Science: plus its campus in Malaysia enables research to take place in a tropical zone. Real-world outcomes are vital. In Malawi, for example, more than a third of children suffer from reduced growth due to malnutrition, partly due to \u201chidden hunger\u201d \u2013 deficiencies of zinc and other mineral nutrients in their diet. The GeoNutrition project received \u00a34.4m from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to research how these micronutrient deficiencies could be alleviated. Precision Imaging has a long and proud history at Nottingham. Physicist and Nobel laureate Sir Peter Mansfield invented the MRI scanner there in the 1970s; and now, more than 40 years later, the Precision Imaging beacon is taking that work into the future. A team led by Dr Matt Brookes developed a revolutionary brain scanner, worn like a helmet, which enables patients to move naturally while being scanned. The sky\u2019s the limit for the teams working on Propulsion Futures: a flying motorbike and an electric superbike are just two of the ideas they\u2019re working on, while the new research and innovation centre for power electronics and machines is aiming to be a global centre of excellence in power electronics, machines and control, thanks to a \u00a39.4m grant from the Higher Education Funding Council for England. Green Chemicals aims to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, with a focus on the UN\u2019s goals of sustainable industrialisation and climate action. Its collaborations with industry will deliver sustainable products such as biodegradable plastic packaging, while in the developing world access to life-saving pharmaceuticals such as anti-malarials will improve due to new low-energy, greener manufacturing processes. Smart Products brings together experts from engineering, the arts, social sciences and computing to harness the digital revolution \u2013 enabling manufacturers and consumers to together create new kinds of personalised products. Researchers are also exploring human-robot collaboration in sectors ranging from healthcare to food manufacturing. Focusing on specific areas doesn\u2019t just help teams focus; it also enables the university to bring in more funding, says Corner. \u201cIt helps us understand our priorities, but has also helped our academic colleagues be very clear about what they need in order to address challenges and formulate bold proposals for programmes, projects, infrastructure and equipment. The beacons enable connection with funding bodies, industrial partners, charities and policy makers, and can align with their agendas and funding streams.\u201d Having six very clearly defined areas also enables better collaboration across the globe. Corner points out that no single institution can do everything. \u201cWe have great people, across a huge range of disciplines. But it\u2019s unlikely that any one institution will have everything at its disposal to tackle these very wide-ranging and complex problems. Working in partnership with other institutions or individuals and other groups in different parts of the world is really important.\u201d And the beacons also help attract the most vital aspect of innovation: great people. The university will recruit 100 Nottingham research and Anne McLaren fellows by the end of 2022. Sixty have been appointed already, with many in beacon areas. The university is committed to appointing more women and people from BAME backgrounds to follow in the footsteps of people such as Prof Liz Sockett, the university\u2019s first female academic to be made a fellow of the Royal Society for her work on friendly bacteria that can kill pathogenic superbugs. The university has always been a great place to innovate, says Corner, but the beacons are ushering in an era of new possibilities. \u201cThere\u2019s always something going on. But right now, using our relationships around the world to work on common problems is particularly exciting. We\u2019ve made significant contributions to society before, but we are trying to do this in a more expanded, forceful and definitive way.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The world\u2019s population is expected to reach 9.7 billion by the year 2050, according to the most recent report from the population division of the United Nations (UN) Department of Economic and Social Affairs. That\u2019s an extra two billion mouths to feed, all from the same amount of land and other natural resources. At present, we have around 821 million undernourished people, and 672 million who are obese, according to the UN\u2019s Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) 2018 figures. The challenge, then, is not just to fill stomachs, but to even out those extremes and work towards a food system that is equitable, prioritises health, and is sustainable for both people and the planet. This is where the University of Nottingham\u2019s Future Food beacon comes in. Launched in 2017, Future Food is one of the University\u2019s six Beacons of Excellence \u2013 Rights Lab, Precision Imaging, Future Food, Propulsion Futures, Green Chemicals and Smart Products \u2013 carrying out research to collectively address all 17 of the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals. \u201cWe are faced with the need to provide sufficient nutritious food for a growing population, while at the same time tackling diet-related diseases of affluence, such as diabetes and obesity,\u201d says Prof David Salt, director of the Future Food beacon. \u201cInnovations in our key research areas \u2013 future-proofing agricultural systems, food for health, food for sustainable livelihoods, and food processing and manufacturing \u2013 lie at the heart of this challenge. We must develop new, resilient crops and livestock, ensure better access to healthier, safer, more nutritious food for everyone, and take into account ethical concerns.\u201d The Future Food beacon\u2019s researchers have expertise across the food chain and have so far published 38 papers in peer-reviewed journals; 24 research proposals have been awarded just under \u00a310m in total. As part of the investment in the beacon, there have been new appointments in research fields such as crop molecular genetics, phenomics, evolutionary and functional genomics, microbiome, sensory science, environmetrics, computer vision, and bioinformatics. One of the new research fellows in functional genomics, Dr Sina Fischer is researching what happens to a plant when it duplicates its entire genome and how that affects its resilience to various environmental stresses. Her findings are relevant to key food crops such as wheat, as many crops have duplicated their genomes during their evolutionary history. For Fischer, joining the Future Food beacon as a researcher was partly about joining a larger team making a contribution to human health. \u201cThere is a huge network here,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is vital for a researcher to have a collaborative network. The beacon has enabled me to meet other researchers, talk about their projects, and start new projects.\u201d The beacon also includes researchers at University of Nottingham Ningbo China and University of Nottingham Malaysia. Dr Hui Hui Chai, a teaching fellow at the School of Biosciences at the University of Nottingham in Malaysia, is studying the potential of bambara groundnut in crop diversification. \u201cIt\u2019s imperative to grow a variety of crops in an area and for those crops to be resilient,\u201d says Chai. \u201cWe know bambara groundnut is drought-tolerant and has good nutritional composition. However, its pod yields can be low and erratic. This is an issue I am aiming to combat in my research through breeding and agronomic studies.\u201d Given the global nature of the challenge, Future Food beacon colleagues at all three University of Nottingham campuses are working to develop partnerships within the UK and around the world, in China and Brazil and across the African continent in particular. In the UK, the Graduate Centre for International Agriculture (GCIA) is a collaboration between the beacon and Rothamsted Research, funding 25 PhD studentships. In Brazil, Future Food is working with the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa) on soils, animal production, livestock infectious diseases and crop quality. And in China, the beacon has a series of projects including limiting cadmium and arsenic accumulation in rice, developing precision nutrition \u2013 bespoke diets reflecting individual and environmental characteristics \u2013 for livestock, and controlling antibiotic resistance in livestock. The beacon\u2019s networks also include other stakeholders in the future of food, such as farmer organisations and the private sector. One project links a \u201cbean-to-bar\u201d premium chocolate maker in Nottingham, Luisa\u2019s Vegan Chocolates, with cocoa growers in Colombia. Using hand-held DNA sequencing equipment, researchers and farmers will measure the microbes fermenting the cocoa beans, in order to better understand the fermentation process. This project will improve both the livelihoods of the growers and the chocolate for consumers. \u201cThe overall aim with all our programmes is to facilitate a cross fertilisation of disciplines,\u201d says Salt. \u201cAt present, more than a quarter of the world\u2019s population are not getting the goodness they need from what they eat, so we need to make some big strides if we are to change that by 2050.

      "bodyText": "The Russian state directed and ran the military coup in Crimea and its subsequent annexation in 2014, Ukraine has told the European court of human rights. The case in Strasbourg is one of a series brought by the Ukrainian government designed to expose alleged Russian state complicity in human rights abuses. It has the potential to embarrass Vladimir Putin and lead to Ukrainian demands for reparations from Russia. Russia rejects allegations it was responsible for the annexation and sought on Wednesday to strike out the case in an attempt to stop it proceeding to its next stage \u2013 gathering of direct evidence. Ben Emmerson QC, representing the Ukrainian government, told the court Ukraine lost control of Crimea on the day of the coup not as a result of unilateral action by armed separatists but \u201cas the result of a military invasion by the armed forces of the Russian Federation, aided and abetted by pro-Russian political and paramilitary proxies in Crimea\u201d. Russia warned Europe\u2019s human rights tribunal it risks opening a \u201cPandora\u2019s Box\u201d of politically motivated cases if it accepts Ukraine\u2019s claims that Moscow-led forces committed atrocities in the Crimea. The case comes at a politically sensitive time, as the new Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, explores the possibility of fresh talks with Putin over the future of both the occupied Donbass region and Crimea. An unprecedented prisoner swap at the weekend opened the door to a new climate but the pursuit of the ECHR case shows how determined Ukraine remains to force Russia out of its country, including Crimea. Emmerson insisted Russia was legally answerable for human rights violations \u2013 not as the territorial sovereign \u2013 but as an occupying power.

      "bodyText": "Subscribe now to receive the morning briefing by email. Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. President says he \u2018disagreed strongly\u2019 with hawkish Bolton Donald Trump has fired his national security adviser, John Bolton, saying he \u201cdisagreed strongly\u201d with his hawkish attitude to foreign affairs. The two men also appeared to disagree on whether he jumped or was pushed, with Bolton claiming he had offered to resign before the president announced his dismissal. Trump is expected to name a new national security adviser \u2013 his fourth in less than three years \u2013 next week. Personality clash. The bellicose Bolton might have buried the achievements of the Obama administration, but he was never going to give Trump the diplomatic wins he\u2019d like to brandish on the campaign trail, writes Julian Borger. Foreign policy. Bolton\u2019s dismissal will very likely lead to a change of emphasis in foreign policy, says Patrick Wintour, with the president\u2019s anti-interventionist instincts and preference for personal diplomacy potentially coming to the fore. How Rick Scott\u2019s Florida refused $70m to tackle HIV crisis Florida\u2019s HIV crisis reached a severity almost without equal in the US under Rick Scott, the state\u2019s governor from 2011 to 2019. Now, a Guardian investigation has revealed his administration effectively blocked $70m in federal funds to fight the epidemic. From 2015 to 2017, Florida sent back $54m for combating HIV to the US government after health chiefs failed to secure legislative permission to spend it. And in 2015, Scott\u2019s administration blocked grants worth a total of $16m for two counties with unusually high HIV rates. HIV rates. HIV diagnoses were declining in Florida until 2013, only to increase by nearly 11% through 2017. Of the 10 states that account for 65% of new HIV cases nationally, Florida was the only one to experience an increase between 2010 and 2017. Budget authority. Now a Republican senator, Scott made it a bedrock principle of his governorship to refuse federal dollars. In a statement, a Scott spokeswoman said \u201cthe state could only spend the money that it had the budget authority to spend\u201d. Trump-backed Republican wins North Carolina special election A Trump-endorsed Republican has won a fiercely contested congressional special election in North Carolina, a race seen as a bellwether for the president\u2019s 2020 re-election hopes. The conservative state senator Dan Bishop had been running almost neck and neck with the Democrat Dan McCready, a former Marine and Harvard graduate, in the state\u2019s traditionally Republican 9th district. But Bishop declared victory late on Tuesday after securing 50.8% of the vote to McCready\u2019s 48.8%. Bathroom bill. Bishop was previously best known for co-sponsoring North Carolina\u2019s \u201cbathroom bill\u201d, which forced transgender people to use bathrooms matching the gender on their birth certificates in state buildings. The law was subsequently repealed after a national outcry. Arab leaders decry Netanyahu\u2019s West Bank annexation plan Arab foreign ministers convened in Cairo late on Tuesday for an emergency meeting to denounce Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s new plan to annex further swaths of the Palestinian West Bank if he is re-elected next week. The Israeli prime minister, who is battling to build a governing coalition in the country\u2019s elections on 17 September, held a live press conference on Tuesday to unveil the plan that, if implemented, would effectively sink Palestinian hopes for statehood. Trump links. Netanyahu, who has touted his close links to the current White House, said the annexation would be carried out \u201cin maximum coordination with Trump\u201d. Peace process. The Arab League said Netanyahu\u2019s proposal would \u201c[undermine] the chances of any progress in the peace process and will torpedo all its foundations\u201d. Cheat sheet Three Australians, two of them dual UK citizens, have been imprisoned in Iran amid rising tensions with a US-led coalition that includes the UK and Australia. The UK on Tuesday accused Iran of selling oil to Syria from a tanker British forces had previously seized and released. Californian lawmakers have passed a landmark bill designed to make it significantly more difficult for companies such as Uber and Lyft to classify gig economy workers as independent contractors rather than employees. Russian authorities initially investigated the 2017 disappearance of the Kremlin official Oleg Smolenkov as a murder, before concluding he was still alive and living abroad. Smolenkov is now suspected of being a CIA mole who was spirited away to the US. Justin Trudeau will on Wednesday request the dissolution of the Canadian parliament, as campaigning begins for the 21 October election, at which the prime minister will seek a second term despite an increasingly divided electorate. Must-reads Behind the story that launched the #MeToo movement Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor are the New York Times reporters who first broke the story of Harvey Weinstein\u2019s alleged sexual harassment, unleashing the #MeToo movement. Their new book goes behind the scenes of their expos\u00e9 which, as Kantor tells Adrian Horton, led to a \u201cdisplay of mass accountability without precedent\u201d. Bahamian refugees\u2019 Florida welcome undercut by politics More than 1,400 weary and vulnerable Bahamian refugees stepped off a cruise ship in Florida at the weekend, after fleeing the devastation of Hurricane Dorian. But the warm welcome they received from locals was coloured by comments from the president, as Richard Luscombe reports. A new view of the Beatles\u2019 breakup The received wisdom is that the Beatles recorded Abbey Road knowing it was their final album, and that John Lennon was behind the group\u2019s eventual breakup. But a 50-year-old audio tape of conversations between the Fab Four appears to give the lie to that narrative, their biographer Mark Lewisohn tells Richard Williams. When cooks won\u2019t take food allergies seriously Ben Feltwell is allergic to eggs. So when a chef claimed his pastry didn\u2019t contain any, it led to four hours of vomiting. On a camping trip, a sceptical companion slipped an egg into Feltwell\u2019s curry, with similar results. Sirin Kale asks why so many people refuse to take severe food allergies seriously. Opinion The Testaments, Margaret Atwood\u2019s blockbuster sequel to The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, presents a vivid portrait of feminist resistance, says Natasha Walter. But we should beware of simplifying its complex portrayal of women. Feminist fiction is not just about making our political world clearer and simpler. It is not just about providing us with reassurance that we are on the side of the good. We see that complexity time and again in Atwood\u2019s fiction, even if the popular conception of Gilead, especially the way it has been disseminated through political protest and the television series, has often flattened it out for us. Sport The NFL star and New England Patriots wide receiver Antonio Brown has been accused of raping a woman who formerly worked as his physical trainer, according to a federal lawsuit. The California assembly has passed a bill permitting the state\u2019s student athletes to hire agents and make money from the use of their name, image or likeness, setting up a probable legal showdown with the US governing body for college sports, the NCAA.

      "body": "<p>It is said of Harold Wilson that he epitomised the quip: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/102986\" title=\"\">If you can\u2019t ride two horses at the same time, you shouldn\u2019t be in the circus</a>.\u201d He was often criticised for putting pragmatism before principle in his 13 years as Labour leader, but it was an attribute that served him well in preventing the party from tearing itself apart on Europe in the 1970s.</p> <p>When Wilson won a fourth general election on 10 October 1974, he faced the challenge of navigating Labour\u2019s deep divisions on whether or not to reverse the 1972 decision to join the common market. The party\u2019s election manifesto had promised the British people a \u201cfinal say\u201d on Britain\u2019s membership without committing itself one way or another to a recommendation. \u201c<a href=\"http://www.labour-party.org.uk/manifestos/1974/Oct/1974-oct-labour-manifesto.shtml\" title=\"\">It is as yet too early to judge the likely results of the tough negotiations which are taking place,</a>\u201d it said.</p> <p>Wilson did not commit himself to a definite conclusion for another five months. Tony Benn, who was secretary of state for industry at the time, records in his diary that Wilson told the crucial cabinet meeting on 18 March 1975 that he was \u201cpersuaded 51% to 49% \u201d to support the renegotiated membership terms. \u201cI had anxieties right up to the last few days, but I now recommend that we stay in,\u201d he said.</p> <p>With the referendum set for 10 June 1975, Wilson had left it until the vote was less than three months away to announce that he would back the deal he had negotiated. His positioning as an honest broker was not only politically astute, it was also credible because he was not associated with either of the contending camps, both of which saw the common market membership issue as a matter of principle.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s current policy is similar to the approach Wilson took 44 years ago. Jeremy Corbyn says a Labour government would give people the final say in a public vote between \u201ccredible options for both sides\u201d; namely, the best deal it can get from the EU \u2013 based on the policy in Labour\u2019s 2017 manifesto \u2013 and remaining in the EU.</p> <p>Corbyn has, much to the frustration of some, doggedly pursued an attempt to unite people across the Brexit divide through a deal that protects trade and standards. And this now puts him in a position akin to Wilson\u2019s as someone who can credibly act as an honest broker in giving people a final say.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e1f16028e0b7257a05321f2f5bc6f491945b58de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1f16028e0b7257a05321f2f5bc6f491945b58de/0_19_4425_2655/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harold Wilson and his wife Mary campaigning before the 1974 general election\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harold Wilson and his wife Mary campaigning before the 1974 general election</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bettmann Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The problem for Labour, however, is that some of the other <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/10/tom-watson-to-break-labours-uneasy-truce-over-brexit\" title=\"\">big hitters in the shadow cabinet</a> have now nailed their colours firmly to the remain mast. While this is as much their prerogative as it was for the opposing protagonists in 1975, it does make it harder to sustain the argument that they could negotiate effectively with Brussels.</p> <p>As <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m0008cww/question-time-2019-05092019\" title=\"\">Emily Thornberry found on Question Time</a> last week, it is easier for political opponents to ridicule Labour\u2019s position if the party is suggesting that the negotiations would be led by people committed in advance to rejecting their outcome. It makes sense for Labour to make clear its team will be made up mainly of ministers who are seen to be open minded about the potential benefits of a deal.</p> <p>Remainers argue, of course, that there is no better deal than the one we\u2019ve got and, because of that, to pursue negotiations is itself disingenuous. Forget Wilson, they would no doubt say, Labour should simply campaign to reverse the 2016 decision.</p> <p>Let\u2019s leave aside <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2019/08/why-labour-s-brexit-stance-still-offers-best-hope-resolving-crisis\" title=\"\">the potentially suicidal electoral implications</a> of that position. There is a case for saying a new deal with the EU could be better for working people than being a member.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/10/tom-watson-to-break-labours-uneasy-truce-over-brexit\">Brexit: Tom Watson to break Labour's uneasy truce</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For a start, no economic modelling has been done for a situation in which government is paralysed indefinitely by Brexit gridlock, but we have already seen the negative impact of so much uncertainty. If it drags on for many more years, the effects could be far worse than any of the official scenarios published so far.</p> <p>Equally, no one can say for sure what the upside benefits are of a Labour government being less constrained by state aid and competition rules than it would be as a member \u2013 but the fact that many <a href=\"http://renewal.org.uk/files/Tarrant_Biondi_Brexit_Labour_Updated.pdf\" title=\"\">remainers also argue for reform of these rules acknowledges</a> there is a problem.</p> <p>And no one can accurately quantify the political and social dividend that could accrue from securing a new relationship with Europe that gains the consent of both leave and remain voters.</p> <p>The option of a credible deal surely, therefore, has to be pursued in good faith, but would Brussels have any incentive to offer something better than May negotiated when their preference is bound to be for the UK to remain in the EU?</p> <p>The big problem with May\u2019s approach was her desire to open the door to deregulation of the economy. For Brussels, this represented a competitive threat. But that does not arise with Labour, which sees EU employment rights and consumer and environmental protections as something to build on rather than destroy. This in itself should make it much easier to agree on a new trading relationship, including a resolution to the Irish border issue.</p> <p>If Labour won an election on a pledge to negotiate a new deal and put it to a public vote, Brussels would be wise to offer something that protects the economic relationship rather than pinning everything on remain winning a majority.</p> <p>Remainers might want the EU to offer an unattractive package, but it\u2019s more likely they will see the merit in hedging their bets by giving British voters a choice between staying members or leaving on terms that they can live with.</p> <p>It may be counterintuitive in the midst of this crisis, but a Wilsonian approach on Labour\u2019s part could produce an outbreak of pragmatism on both sides of the Channel. If it does, that would allow the public to choose between two credible options, thus increasing the chances of the outcome commanding broad support. Like Wilson, Corbyn would not have to decide his recommendation until the final details of a new deal are known.</p> <p>\u2022 Steve Howell is author of Game Changer: Eight Weeks that Transformed British Politics.

      "bodyText": "It is said of Harold Wilson that he epitomised the quip: \u201cIf you can\u2019t ride two horses at the same time, you shouldn\u2019t be in the circus.\u201d He was often criticised for putting pragmatism before principle in his 13 years as Labour leader, but it was an attribute that served him well in preventing the party from tearing itself apart on Europe in the 1970s. When Wilson won a fourth general election on 10 October 1974, he faced the challenge of navigating Labour\u2019s deep divisions on whether or not to reverse the 1972 decision to join the common market. The party\u2019s election manifesto had promised the British people a \u201cfinal say\u201d on Britain\u2019s membership without committing itself one way or another to a recommendation. \u201cIt is as yet too early to judge the likely results of the tough negotiations which are taking place,\u201d it said. Wilson did not commit himself to a definite conclusion for another five months. Tony Benn, who was secretary of state for industry at the time, records in his diary that Wilson told the crucial cabinet meeting on 18 March 1975 that he was \u201cpersuaded 51% to 49% \u201d to support the renegotiated membership terms. \u201cI had anxieties right up to the last few days, but I now recommend that we stay in,\u201d he said. With the referendum set for 10 June 1975, Wilson had left it until the vote was less than three months away to announce that he would back the deal he had negotiated. His positioning as an honest broker was not only politically astute, it was also credible because he was not associated with either of the contending camps, both of which saw the common market membership issue as a matter of principle. Labour\u2019s current policy is similar to the approach Wilson took 44 years ago. Jeremy Corbyn says a Labour government would give people the final say in a public vote between \u201ccredible options for both sides\u201d; namely, the best deal it can get from the EU \u2013 based on the policy in Labour\u2019s 2017 manifesto \u2013 and remaining in the EU. Corbyn has, much to the frustration of some, doggedly pursued an attempt to unite people across the Brexit divide through a deal that protects trade and standards. And this now puts him in a position akin to Wilson\u2019s as someone who can credibly act as an honest broker in giving people a final say. The problem for Labour, however, is that some of the other big hitters in the shadow cabinet have now nailed their colours firmly to the remain mast. While this is as much their prerogative as it was for the opposing protagonists in 1975, it does make it harder to sustain the argument that they could negotiate effectively with Brussels. As Emily Thornberry found on Question Time last week, it is easier for political opponents to ridicule Labour\u2019s position if the party is suggesting that the negotiations would be led by people committed in advance to rejecting their outcome. It makes sense for Labour to make clear its team will be made up mainly of ministers who are seen to be open minded about the potential benefits of a deal. Remainers argue, of course, that there is no better deal than the one we\u2019ve got and, because of that, to pursue negotiations is itself disingenuous. Forget Wilson, they would no doubt say, Labour should simply campaign to reverse the 2016 decision. Let\u2019s leave aside the potentially suicidal electoral implications of that position. There is a case for saying a new deal with the EU could be better for working people than being a member. For a start, no economic modelling has been done for a situation in which government is paralysed indefinitely by Brexit gridlock, but we have already seen the negative impact of so much uncertainty. If it drags on for many more years, the effects could be far worse than any of the official scenarios published so far. Equally, no one can say for sure what the upside benefits are of a Labour government being less constrained by state aid and competition rules than it would be as a member \u2013 but the fact that many remainers also argue for reform of these rules acknowledges there is a problem. And no one can accurately quantify the political and social dividend that could accrue from securing a new relationship with Europe that gains the consent of both leave and remain voters. The option of a credible deal surely, therefore, has to be pursued in good faith, but would Brussels have any incentive to offer something better than May negotiated when their preference is bound to be for the UK to remain in the EU? The big problem with May\u2019s approach was her desire to open the door to deregulation of the economy. For Brussels, this represented a competitive threat. But that does not arise with Labour, which sees EU employment rights and consumer and environmental protections as something to build on rather than destroy. This in itself should make it much easier to agree on a new trading relationship, including a resolution to the Irish border issue. If Labour won an election on a pledge to negotiate a new deal and put it to a public vote, Brussels would be wise to offer something that protects the economic relationship rather than pinning everything on remain winning a majority. Remainers might want the EU to offer an unattractive package, but it\u2019s more likely they will see the merit in hedging their bets by giving British voters a choice between staying members or leaving on terms that they can live with. It may be counterintuitive in the midst of this crisis, but a Wilsonian approach on Labour\u2019s part could produce an outbreak of pragmatism on both sides of the Channel. If it does, that would allow the public to choose between two credible options, thus increasing the chances of the outcome commanding broad support. Like Wilson, Corbyn would not have to decide his recommendation until the final details of a new deal are known. \u2022 Steve Howell is author of Game Changer: Eight Weeks that Transformed British Politics.

      "body": "<h2>1) Kosovo hype is right on the night</h2> <p>Kosovo came into their match against England second in Group A and being talked up by everyone, Gareth Southgate included, as dangerous opponents. It didn\u2019t feel that way by half-time with the hosts leading 5-1, but Kosovo came out not only fighting but reorganised, and gave England an actual scare. Valon Berisha was the stand-out, bagging a well-taken double, but forward Vedat Muriqi provided strength and awareness (not to mention the whipped left foot pass that split England\u2019s defence for Berisha\u2019s second) while Swansea\u2019s Bersant Celina added guile. Perhaps the pivotal contribution, however, came from coach Bernard Challandes. His switch to 4-4-2 put England\u2019s creaky centre-backs under more pressure than they had endured in the opening period, and it made the difference to a second half in which Kosovo lived up to their billing. <strong>Paul MacInnes</strong></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/10/england-kosovo-euro-2020-qualifying-match-report\">Match report: England 5-3 Kosovo</a></p> <h2><strong>2) Spurs count cost of bruising clash in Los Angeles</strong></h2> <p>There is no such thing as a friendly between Argentina and Chile. The two teams have developed a frenetic rivalry in recent years, sharing four red cards in the previous four meetings. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/06/lionel-messi-controversial-red-card-argentina-chile-match-report\">Lionel Messi\u2019s red card</a> against Chile in July\u2019s Copa Am\u00e9rica third-place play-off spared him from Friday\u2019s encounter, where the reckless and dangerous challenges resumed from both sides. Argentina were particularly on the receiving end, with Juventus\u2019s Paolo Dybala, Inter\u2019s Lautaro Mart\u00ednez and Tottenham\u2019s Giovani Lo Celso all caught above the ankle with studs \u2013 the latter also sustaining a hip injury that will keep him sidelined for the next six weeks. For Spurs and other clubs, this fixture \u2013 played in front of a sparse crowd in Los Angeles \u2013 must have seemed wholly unnecessary and ill-thought out, with perhaps Alexis S\u00e1nchez completing 90 minutes the only positive. <strong>Michael Butler</strong></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/may/15/the-recap-sign-up-for-the-best-of-the-guardians-sport-coverage\">The Recap: sign up for the best of our sport coverage</a></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/10/england-kosovo-euro-2020-qualifying-match-report\">Jadon Sancho the difference as blunders mar England\u2019s 5-3 win against Kosovo</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>3) Northern Ireland show new dimension in defeat to Germany</h2> <p>Germany emerged from Belfast after their mini crisis, having lost at home to the Netherlands. Michael O\u2019Neill and Joachim L\u00f6w can take a certain satisfaction, in their own different ways. Northern Ireland have long been noted as being a primarily physical threat, especially at home. However, as O\u2019Neill stresses, they now have an extra dimension, in terms of athleticism and confidence on the ball, as illustrated by George Saville and Jamal Lewis. In goal too, Bailey Peacock Farrell looked impressive, as Germany fashioned chances as well as goals from Marcel Halstenberg and Serge Gnabry. L\u00f6w was pleased with the result if not altogether the performance. His instincts to stick with new players, such as Halstenberg, was vindicated. <strong>Julian Taylor</strong></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/09/northern-ireland-germany-euro-2020-qualifying-match-report\">Match report: Northern Ireland 0-2 Germany</a></p> <h2><strong>4) Refereeing calamities hand Italy easy ride</strong></h2> <p>If you are Italian, Group J makes for pretty reading. Six wins out of six, and six points clear at the top, meaning they are potentially only one more win away from qualification for Euro 2020. While progress is being made, this week\u2019s narrow away wins only came after two shocking refereeing decisions. With the score at 1-1, Armenia\u2019s Aleksandr Karapetyan was sent off for an elbow that never was, while Finland \u2013 also drawing 1-1 with 10 minutes left \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/08/euro-2020-roundup-italy-finland-norway-sweden\">were extremely unlucky</a> to be penalised by the Scottish referee Bobby Madden for a handball inside the box.

Giggs was appointed Wales manager in January last year and has used 43 players across 15 matches. His argument would be that injuries and a lack of match fitness have contributed heavily. Whether he has a case or not, with two critical qualifiers coming up, Giggs badly needs to get his team selection and formation right. Friday\u2019s unconvincing 2-1 win over Azerbaijan strengthened the calls for another midfielder to be included at the expense of a makeshift striker/false nine. Aaron Ramsey\u2019s possible return from injury could solve that problem. A 4-3-3 formation featuring Gareth Bale through the middle, with Dan James and Harry Wilson either side, would give Wales a threat on the counterattack and more control in the centre of the pitch. <strong>Stuart James</strong></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/09/wales-belarus-international-friendly-match-report\">Match report: Wales 1-0 Belarus</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/06/wales-azerbaijan-euro-2020-qualifier-match-report\">Match report: Wales 2-1 Azerbaijan</a></p> <h2>6) Sierra Leone\u2019s World Cup heartbreak spills into violence</h2> <p>The fallout from Umaru Bangura\u2019s missed penalty in injury-time of Sierra Leone\u2019s World Cup qualifying defeat to Liberia spilled over into violence after the FC Zurich midfielder\u2019s home was pelted with stones by angry fans. \u201cIt was one of the worst days of my life,\u201d Bangura told the BBC while holed up in his bedroom. \u201cI can\u2019t even go outside because I didn\u2019t expect this kind of hostility towards me.\u201d There were also reports that four Red Cross staff were injured after coming under attack following the final whistle in Freetown as they attempted to protect Bangura after his penalty was saved by the 18-year-old Liberian goalkeeper Ashley Williams. \u201cHooliganism is becoming unprecedented,\u201d said the sports minister, Ibrahim Nyelenkeh. \u201cI think measures should be put in place to combat it.\u201d <strong>Ed Aarons</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/10/euro-2020-qualifying-roundup-cristiano-ronaldo-portugal-france-serbia-czech-republic\">Euro 2020 roundup: Ronaldo gets four, France stroll it, Czechs bounce back</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>7) Hampden could be grim backdrop for San Marino\u2019s visit</h2> <p>It felt impossible not to spurt with laughter as Hampden Park\u2019s Tannoy announcer used full-time of the mauling by Belgium to urge supporters to buy tickets for the visit of San Marino. On a Sunday evening in October, just days after facing Russia in Moscow, the team ranked 211th and bottom of the Fifa rankings come to town. As things stand, only San Marino keep Scotland from the foot of Group I. The Scottish FA\u2019s desire to buy Hampden from Queen\u2019s Park always looked questionable.

      "bodyText": "1) Kosovo hype is right on the night Kosovo came into their match against England second in Group A and being talked up by everyone, Gareth Southgate included, as dangerous opponents. It didn\u2019t feel that way by half-time with the hosts leading 5-1, but Kosovo came out not only fighting but reorganised, and gave England an actual scare. Valon Berisha was the stand-out, bagging a well-taken double, but forward Vedat Muriqi provided strength and awareness (not to mention the whipped left foot pass that split England\u2019s defence for Berisha\u2019s second) while Swansea\u2019s Bersant Celina added guile. Perhaps the pivotal contribution, however, came from coach Bernard Challandes. His switch to 4-4-2 put England\u2019s creaky centre-backs under more pressure than they had endured in the opening period, and it made the difference to a second half in which Kosovo lived up to their billing. Paul MacInnes \u2022 Match report: England 5-3 Kosovo 2) Spurs count cost of bruising clash in Los Angeles There is no such thing as a friendly between Argentina and Chile. The two teams have developed a frenetic rivalry in recent years, sharing four red cards in the previous four meetings. Lionel Messi\u2019s red card against Chile in July\u2019s Copa Am\u00e9rica third-place play-off spared him from Friday\u2019s encounter, where the reckless and dangerous challenges resumed from both sides. Argentina were particularly on the receiving end, with Juventus\u2019s Paolo Dybala, Inter\u2019s Lautaro Mart\u00ednez and Tottenham\u2019s Giovani Lo Celso all caught above the ankle with studs \u2013 the latter also sustaining a hip injury that will keep him sidelined for the next six weeks. For Spurs and other clubs, this fixture \u2013 played in front of a sparse crowd in Los Angeles \u2013 must have seemed wholly unnecessary and ill-thought out, with perhaps Alexis S\u00e1nchez completing 90 minutes the only positive. Michael Butler \u2022 The Recap: sign up for the best of our sport coverage 3) Northern Ireland show new dimension in defeat to Germany Germany emerged from Belfast after their mini crisis, having lost at home to the Netherlands. Michael O\u2019Neill and Joachim L\u00f6w can take a certain satisfaction, in their own different ways. Northern Ireland have long been noted as being a primarily physical threat, especially at home. However, as O\u2019Neill stresses, they now have an extra dimension, in terms of athleticism and confidence on the ball, as illustrated by George Saville and Jamal Lewis. In goal too, Bailey Peacock Farrell looked impressive, as Germany fashioned chances as well as goals from Marcel Halstenberg and Serge Gnabry. L\u00f6w was pleased with the result if not altogether the performance. His instincts to stick with new players, such as Halstenberg, was vindicated. Julian Taylor \u2022 Match report: Northern Ireland 0-2 Germany 4) Refereeing calamities hand Italy easy ride If you are Italian, Group J makes for pretty reading. Six wins out of six, and six points clear at the top, meaning they are potentially only one more win away from qualification for Euro 2020. While progress is being made, this week\u2019s narrow away wins only came after two shocking refereeing decisions. With the score at 1-1, Armenia\u2019s Aleksandr Karapetyan was sent off for an elbow that never was, while Finland \u2013 also drawing 1-1 with 10 minutes left \u2013 were extremely unlucky to be penalised by the Scottish referee Bobby Madden for a handball inside the box. Roberto Mancini deserves some praise, but optimism must be tempered: only Bosnia and Herzegovina from Group J are ranked inside Fifa\u2019s top 50. Italy are still a long way off being considered anything other than dark horses for next year\u2019s tournament. MB \u2022 Euro 2020 roundup: Italy beat Finland while Norway draw in Sweden 5) Does Giggs know his best Wales team? One of the criticisms levelled at Ryan Giggs is that he still does not know his best starting XI. Giggs was appointed Wales manager in January last year and has used 43 players across 15 matches. His argument would be that injuries and a lack of match fitness have contributed heavily. Whether he has a case or not, with two critical qualifiers coming up, Giggs badly needs to get his team selection and formation right. Friday\u2019s unconvincing 2-1 win over Azerbaijan strengthened the calls for another midfielder to be included at the expense of a makeshift striker/false nine. Aaron Ramsey\u2019s possible return from injury could solve that problem. A 4-3-3 formation featuring Gareth Bale through the middle, with Dan James and Harry Wilson either side, would give Wales a threat on the counterattack and more control in the centre of the pitch.

On a Sunday evening in October, just days after facing Russia in Moscow, the team ranked 211th and bottom of the Fifa rankings come to town. As things stand, only San Marino keep Scotland from the foot of Group I. The Scottish FA\u2019s desire to buy Hampden from Queen\u2019s Park always looked questionable. When far from full, the stadium lacks any form of atmosphere. Scotland has alternative grounds to fit the requirements of the national side and showpiece domestic matches.

The company was losing its ability to make safe airplanes. As Scott Hamilton, <a href=\"https://www.postandcourier.com/business/airline-surveys-point-to-ongoing-production-problems-at-boeing-s/article_0e75f53a-b2d6-11e9-9606-0ffafccd055e.html\">an aerospace analyst</a> and editor of Leeham News and Analysis, puts it: \u201cBoeing Commercial Airplanes clearly has a systemic problem in designing, producing and delivering airplanes.\u201d</p> <p>Something is wrong with today\u2019s version of capitalism. It\u2019s not just that it\u2019s unfair. It\u2019s that it\u2019s no longer capable of delivering products that work. The root cause is the generation of high and persistent profits, to the exclusion of production. We have let financiers take over our corporations. They monopolize industries and then loot the corporations they run.</p> <p>The executive team at Boeing is quite skilled \u2013 just at generating cash, rather than as engineers. Boeing\u2019s competitive advantage centered on politics, not planes. The corporation is now a <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-07-22/boeing-737-max-latest-friends-in-high-places\">political machine</a> with a side business making aerospace and defense products. Boeing\u2019s general counsel, former judge Michael Luttig, is the former boss of the FBI director, Christopher Wray, whose agents are investigating potential criminal activity at the company. Luttig is so well connected in high-level legal circles he served as a groomsman for the supreme court chief justice, John Roberts.</p> <p>The company\u2019s board members also include Nikki Haley, until recently the United Nations ambassador, former Nato supreme allied commander Edmund PGiambastiani Jr, former AIG CEO Edward M Liddy, and a host of former political officials and private equity icons.</p> <p>Boeing used its political connections to monopolize the American aerospace industry and corrupt its regulators. In the 1990s, Boeing and McDonnell Douglas merged, leaving America with just one major producer of civilian aircraft. Before this merger, when there was a competitive market, Boeing was a wonderful company. As journalist Jerry Useem <a href=\"https://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2000/10/02/288426/index.htm\">put it</a> just 20 years ago, \u201cBoeing has always been less a business than an association of engineers devoted to building amazing flying machines.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>High profits masked the collapse in productive skill until the crashes of the 737 Max</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But after the merger, the engineers lost power to the financiers. Boeing could increase prices, lay off workers, reduce quality and spend its cash buying back stock.</p> <p>And no one could do anything about it. Customers and suppliers no longer had any alternative to Boeing, and Boeing corrupted officials in both parties who were supposed to regulate it. High profits masked the collapse in productive skill until the crashes of the 737 Max.</p> <p>Boeing\u2019s inability to make good safe airplanes is a clear weakness. It is, after all, an airplane aerospace company. But because Boeing is America\u2019s <em>only</em> commercial airplane company, the crisis is rippling across the economy. Michael O\u2019Leary, CEO of Ryanair, which ordered 58 737 Max planes, says his company <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/ryanair-boeing-needs-s-t-together-737-max-profits-2019-7\">cannot grow</a> as planned until Boeing, \u201cgets its shit together\u201d. Contractors and subcontractors slowed production of parts for the airplane, and airline customers scrambled to address shortages of airplanes.</p> <p>Far from being an anomaly, Boeing is the norm in the corporate world across the west. In 2016, the Economist noted that profits across the corporate sector <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/briefing/2016/03/26/too-much-of-a-good-thing\">were</a> high and persistent, a function of a lack of competition across swaths of the economy. If corporations don\u2019t have to compete, they can raise prices to buyers, lower what they pay to suppliers and workers, and reduce quality.</p> <p>High profits result in sloth and corruption. Many of our industrial goliaths are now run in ways that are fundamentally destructive. General Electric, for instance, was once a jewel of American productive capacity, a corporation created out of George Westinghouse and Thomas Edison\u2019s patents for electric systems. Edison helped invent the lightbulb itself, brightening the world. Today, as a result of decisions made by Jack Welch in the 1990s to juice profit returns, GE slaps its label on lightbulbs made in China. Even worse, if investigator Harry Markopoulos is right, General Electric may in fact be riddled with accounting fraud, a once great productive institution strip-mined by financiers.</p> <p>These are not the natural, inevitable results of capitalism. Boeing and GE were once great companies, working in capitalist open markets.</p> <p>So what went wrong? In short, the law. In the 1970s, a host of thinkers on the right and left \u2013 from Milton Friedman to George Stigler to Alfred Kahn to the current liberal supreme court justice Stephen Breyer \u2013 argued that policymakers should take restraints off capital and get rid of anti-monopoly rules. They used many terms to make this case, including deregulation, cost/benefit analysis, and the consumer welfare standard in antitrust law. They embraced the shareholder theory of capitalism, which emphasizes short-term profits. What followed was a radical consolidation of market power, and then systemic looting.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The disease of inefficiency and graft has spread to the government</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Today, high profit margins are a pervasive and corrupting influence across the government and corporate sectors. Private equity firms moved capital from corporations and workers to themselves, <a href=\"https://prospect.org/article/netroots-nation-workers-voice-spoke-volumes\">destroying</a> once healthy retailers like RadioShack, Toys R Us, Payless and K-Mart.</p> <p>The disease of inefficiency and graft has spread to the government. In 1992, Harvard Professor Ash Carter, who later become the secretary of defense under Obama, wrote that the Pentagon was too difficult to do business with. \u201cThe most straightforward step\u201d to address this, he wrote, \u201cwould be to raise the profit margins allowed on defense contracts.\u201d The following year Prof Carter was appointed assistant secretary of defense for international security policy in the first Clinton administration, which followed his advice.</p> <p>Earlier this year, the defense department found that<a href=\"https://docs.house.gov/meetings/GO/GO00/20190515/109477/HHRG-116-GO00-20190515-SD002.pdf\"> one defense contractor </a>run by private equity executives had profit margins of up to 4,451% on spare parts it sold to the military. Consulting giant McKinsey was recently <a href=\"https://federalnewsnetwork.com/reporters-notebook-jason-miller/2019/07/are-gsas-ig-recommendations-to-cancel-mckinseys-schedule-contracts-too-harsh/\">caught trying</a> to charge the government $3m a year for the services of a recent college graduate.</p> <p>The ultimate result of concentrating wealth and corrupting government is to concentrate power in the hands of a few. We\u2019ve been here before. In the 1930s, fascists in Italy and Germany were gaining strength, as were communists in the Russia. Meanwhile, leaders in liberal democracies were confronted by a frightened populace losing faith in democracy. American political leaders were able to take on domestic money lords with a radical antitrust campaign to break the power of the plutocrats. Today we are in a similar situation, with autocrats making an increasingly persuasive case that liberal democracy is weak.</p> <p>The solution to this political crisis is fairly simple, and it involves two basic principles. One, policymakers have to increase competition for large powerful companies, to bring profits down. Executives should spend their time competing with each other to build quality products, not finding ways of attracting former generals, or administration officials to their board of directors. Two, policymakers should raise taxes on wealth and high incomes to radically reduce the concentration of wealth, which will make looting irrational.</p> <p>Our system is no longer aligning rewards with productive skill. Despite the 737 Max crisis, Boeing\u2019s stock price is still twice as high as in July 2015, when Muilenburg took over as CEO. That right there is what is broken about modern capitalism. We had better fix it fast.</p>",

As Scott Hamilton, an aerospace analyst and editor of Leeham News and Analysis, puts it: \u201cBoeing Commercial Airplanes clearly has a systemic problem in designing, producing and delivering airplanes.\u201d Something is wrong with today\u2019s version of capitalism. It\u2019s not just that it\u2019s unfair. It\u2019s that it\u2019s no longer capable of delivering products that work. The root cause is the generation of high and persistent profits, to the exclusion of production. We have let financiers take over our corporations. They monopolize industries and then loot the corporations they run. The executive team at Boeing is quite skilled \u2013 just at generating cash, rather than as engineers. Boeing\u2019s competitive advantage centered on politics, not planes. The corporation is now a political machine with a side business making aerospace and defense products. Boeing\u2019s general counsel, former judge Michael Luttig, is the former boss of the FBI director, Christopher Wray, whose agents are investigating potential criminal activity at the company. Luttig is so well connected in high-level legal circles he served as a groomsman for the supreme court chief justice, John Roberts. The company\u2019s board members also include Nikki Haley, until recently the United Nations ambassador, former Nato supreme allied commander Edmund PGiambastiani Jr, former AIG CEO Edward M Liddy, and a host of former political officials and private equity icons. Boeing used its political connections to monopolize the American aerospace industry and corrupt its regulators. In the 1990s, Boeing and McDonnell Douglas merged, leaving America with just one major producer of civilian aircraft. Before this merger, when there was a competitive market, Boeing was a wonderful company. As journalist Jerry Useem put it just 20 years ago, \u201cBoeing has always been less a business than an association of engineers devoted to building amazing flying machines.\u201d But after the merger, the engineers lost power to the financiers. Boeing could increase prices, lay off workers, reduce quality and spend its cash buying back stock. And no one could do anything about it. Customers and suppliers no longer had any alternative to Boeing, and Boeing corrupted officials in both parties who were supposed to regulate it. High profits masked the collapse in productive skill until the crashes of the 737 Max. Boeing\u2019s inability to make good safe airplanes is a clear weakness. It is, after all, an airplane aerospace company. But because Boeing is America\u2019s only commercial airplane company, the crisis is rippling across the economy. Michael O\u2019Leary, CEO of Ryanair, which ordered 58 737 Max planes, says his company cannot grow as planned until Boeing, \u201cgets its shit together\u201d. Contractors and subcontractors slowed production of parts for the airplane, and airline customers scrambled to address shortages of airplanes. Far from being an anomaly, Boeing is the norm in the corporate world across the west. In 2016, the Economist noted that profits across the corporate sector were high and persistent, a function of a lack of competition across swaths of the economy. If corporations don\u2019t have to compete, they can raise prices to buyers, lower what they pay to suppliers and workers, and reduce quality. High profits result in sloth and corruption. Many of our industrial goliaths are now run in ways that are fundamentally destructive. General Electric, for instance, was once a jewel of American productive capacity, a corporation created out of George Westinghouse and Thomas Edison\u2019s patents for electric systems. Edison helped invent the lightbulb itself, brightening the world. Today, as a result of decisions made by Jack Welch in the 1990s to juice profit returns, GE slaps its label on lightbulbs made in China. Even worse, if investigator Harry Markopoulos is right, General Electric may in fact be riddled with accounting fraud, a once great productive institution strip-mined by financiers. These are not the natural, inevitable results of capitalism. Boeing and GE were once great companies, working in capitalist open markets. So what went wrong? In short, the law. In the 1970s, a host of thinkers on the right and left \u2013 from Milton Friedman to George Stigler to Alfred Kahn to the current liberal supreme court justice Stephen Breyer \u2013 argued that policymakers should take restraints off capital and get rid of anti-monopoly rules. They used many terms to make this case, including deregulation, cost/benefit analysis, and the consumer welfare standard in antitrust law. They embraced the shareholder theory of capitalism, which emphasizes short-term profits. What followed was a radical consolidation of market power, and then systemic looting. Today, high profit margins are a pervasive and corrupting influence across the government and corporate sectors. Private equity firms moved capital from corporations and workers to themselves, destroying once healthy retailers like RadioShack, Toys R Us, Payless and K-Mart. The disease of inefficiency and graft has spread to the government. In 1992, Harvard Professor Ash Carter, who later become the secretary of defense under Obama, wrote that the Pentagon was too difficult to do business with. \u201cThe most straightforward step\u201d to address this, he wrote, \u201cwould be to raise the profit margins allowed on defense contracts.\u201d The following year Prof Carter was appointed assistant secretary of defense for international security policy in the first Clinton administration, which followed his advice. Earlier this year, the defense department found that one defense contractor run by private equity executives had profit margins of up to 4,451% on spare parts it sold to the military. Consulting giant McKinsey was recently caught trying to charge the government $3m a year for the services of a recent college graduate. The ultimate result of concentrating wealth and corrupting government is to concentrate power in the hands of a few. We\u2019ve been here before. In the 1930s, fascists in Italy and Germany were gaining strength, as were communists in the Russia. Meanwhile, leaders in liberal democracies were confronted by a frightened populace losing faith in democracy. American political leaders were able to take on domestic money lords with a radical antitrust campaign to break the power of the plutocrats. Today we are in a similar situation, with autocrats making an increasingly persuasive case that liberal democracy is weak. The solution to this political crisis is fairly simple, and it involves two basic principles. One, policymakers have to increase competition for large powerful companies, to bring profits down. Executives should spend their time competing with each other to build quality products, not finding ways of attracting former generals, or administration officials to their board of directors. Two, policymakers should raise taxes on wealth and high incomes to radically reduce the concentration of wealth, which will make looting irrational. Our system is no longer aligning rewards with productive skill. Despite the 737 Max crisis, Boeing\u2019s stock price is still twice as high as in July 2015, when Muilenburg took over as CEO. That right there is what is broken about modern capitalism. We had better fix it fast.",

      "bodyText": "Anyone who\u2019s followed the women\u2019s tennis tour closely over the last year wasn\u2019t too surprised when Serena Williams came up short in the US Open final against Canadian ingenue Bianca Andreescu in her latest bid to equal Margaret Court\u2019s all-time record of 24 major singles titles. The only question entering Saturday\u2019s match, same as last year\u2019s championship showdown against Naomi Osaka, was whether a wildly talented youngster in her first grand slam final could hold her nerve against a champion twice her age. And, same as last year, it wasn\u2019t long before it was obvious Andreescu could. Williams, who has won grand slams in her teens (one), 20s (12) and 30s (10, a record), but has been stuck on 23 titles \u2013 one behind Court \u2013 since the 2017 Australian Open, has reached the final in four of the seven majors that she\u2019s entered since coming back from the birth of her daughter, failing to win a set in any of them. She turns 38 at the end of the month and is no longer so far ahead of the pack that another title feels inevitable. This is how sports work. Serena is not going to break this record. And that\u2019s OK. Williams is the greatest women\u2019s tennis player ever, a fact acknowledged deep down by even her most vehement critics. The record, or, specifically, wanting it to be beyond any plausible argument, is merely completism. Yes, major championships are the sort of established metric of greatness that sports fans dine on by mooring otherwise impossible cross-generational comparisons, but it\u2019s fair to consider that more than half of Court\u2019s 24 titles came before the Open era when the sport\u2019s four bedrock events allowed professionals to compete with amateurs. Eleven came at the Australian Open during a time when many of the world\u2019s best declined to enter due to the distance and comparatively minute prize fund on offer. That\u2019s not a slight to Court so much as context essential to grasping the scope of Williams\u2019 body of work in a sport that\u2019s never been more globalized and competitive, an evolution that\u2019s only accelerated since Williams turned professional way back in 1995. Yet it\u2019s never been clearer the final steps to yardstick supremacy may be a bridge too far. \u201cI\u2019m, like, so close, so close, so close,\u201d Williams lamented after Saturday\u2019s defeat, \u201cyet so far away.\u201d Four summers ago when Williams won Wimbledon for a sixth time to become the oldest player to win a grand slam singles title in the Open era, she improved to a preposterous 21-4 in major finals, redoubling her reputation as the greatest closer in sports.

The Arab League held an emergency session on Tuesday evening after the Israeli prime minister announced the plan in a live press conference. Netanyahu, who is fighting for his political life before elections on 17 September, said he would permanently seize up to a third of the West Bank, a move that for decades has been considered an endgame scenario for Palestinians\u2019 aspirations of statehood. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had this kind of opportunity since the [1967] six-day war, and may not have it again for another 50 years,\u201d Netanyahu said, referring to the war in which Israel captured the land.

Jordan\u2019s foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, said Netanyahu\u2019s plan was an outrageous election ploy and a \u201cdangerous escalation that shatters the foundations of the peace process\u201d. Netanyahu made the announcement in front of a large map showing Israeli sovereignty extending over the vast majority of the Jordan Valley and slicing off the eastern border with Jordan. \u201cKilling all chances for peace for electoral purposes is irresponsible, dangerous,\u201d Safadi added in a tweet.

Roughly 2 million Palestinians live in Jordan, most of them naturalised but barred from certain jobs on the basis they will one day be able to return to their own state. Jordanians living in the East Bank also fear that Israeli consolidation of its occupied territories could push new waves of refugees into Jordan, at a time when the country is already hosting an estimate 1.4 million Syrian refugees.

      "bodyText": "The Hong Kong stock exchange has made a surprise \u00a332bn bid to take over the 300-year old London Stock Exchange (LSE). The bid was tabled by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX), which said it would create an 18-hour trading day and was a vote of confidence in London as a financial centre, regardless of Brexit. It described the potential tie-up as a \u201ccorporate Romeo and Juliet\u201d. The bid comes weeks after the LSE Group unveiled its own global expansion plan with a $27bn (\u00a322bn) deal to take control of Refinitiv, a financial data business that supplies information screens used on bank trading floors worldwide. The LSE agreed that deal in an attempt to become a UK-headquartered global rival to the billionaire Michael Bloomberg\u2019s financial news and data business. HKEX, whose largest shareholder is the Hong Kong government, is hoping to derail that deal and take control of the London Stock Exchange. Charles Li, HKEX\u2019S chief executive, said: \u201cThis is not a hostile transaction but it is also clearly not a typical transaction. We know we are late. It is almost a corporate Romeo and Juliet. We have been wanting to do this for a long time and now they are engaged with another person.\u201d The proposed deal is the latest in a series of UK firms targeted by overseas investors. Last month, Hong Kong\u2019s richest family, led by the billionaire Li Ka-shing, bought the 220-year-old pub and beer company Greene King for \u00a32.7bn. The Dorset-based defence group Cobham is the target of a \u00a34bn bid from US private equity investors, while the holiday group Thomas Cook is being rescued by Chinese conglomerate Fosun International. Chinese companies have made 15 big acquisitions in the UK so far this year, spending \u00a36.75bn \u2013 already more than the $6bn spent on 23 deals last year.

The work was seen as a symbol of the victorious struggle against Nazism, and after its premiere in Kuybyshev (Samara), performances were given in Moscow, New York and London. Most impressive, it was performed in besieged Leningrad in August 1942 by a much depleted orchestra reinforced by soldiers. Shostakovich was at the zenith of his fame and appeared, wearing a<a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19420720,00.html\"> firefighter\u2019s helmet, </a><a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19420720,00.html\"> on the cover of Time magazine</a>.</p> <p>Once contact with the west was re-established during <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/feb/26/russia.theobserver\">Khrushchev\u2019s 1950s thaw</a>, Britten\u2019s music began to be played in the Soviet Union, although initially the composer was known only for his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vbvhU22uAM\">The Young Person\u2019s Guide to Orchestra</a>.

The return of compliments came the following year when Shostakovich dedicated his 14th Symphony to his English friend. Through its settings of poems dealing with the theme of death, the symphony was a considered response to the War Requiem of 1962, which Shostakovich considered a masterpiece. When Britten presented him with the score, he studied it avidly, taught it to students and confessed to Rostropovich that he particularly envied Britten for having created the descending and ascending <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flEp_xxer88\">whole-tone motif in the Agnes Dei</a>.</p> <p>The composers kept their friendship alive by correspondence and visits.

      "body": "<p>The catwalk season has begun, and there is a new It girl in town. She is Parisian, with dark hair that tumbles in that photogenically messy way that only French women ever master. She wears a lot of black (jeans, ankle boots) and not much makeup \u2013 just a perfect red lip \u2013 and great perfume. Her look is timeless, understated and perennially chic. Think tailoring, iconic accessories and beautiful silk shirts.</p> <p>But Marie Blanchet is a whole new breed of fashion leader, because her look is not about new clothes. As the CEO for William Vintage, the London-based vintage label that dressed Adwoa Aboah for the GQ awards last week and sourced the 1960s Courreges trapeze coat that Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, wore for her New York baby shower, Blanchet stands for a coming age of fashion in which the kudos of the perfectly sourced secondhand piece outshines the appeal of new clothes.</p> <p>Blanchet\u2019s masterplan is to make William Vintage, which was founded a decade ago by the fashion connoisseur and dealer William Banks-Blaney, the first market-leading fashion brand that doesn\u2019t make any new clothes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7922d7233c8c82d9b8bf4000705cc9a94055dd4e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7922d7233c8c82d9b8bf4000705cc9a94055dd4e/2_0_8885_5333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"From left: Norman Norell 1965 sleeveless evening dress, Azzaro floral skirt and matching bustier top and Jacques Heim 1955 haute couture beaded dress.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From left: Norman Norell 1965 sleeveless evening dress, Azzaro floral skirt and matching bustier top and Jacques Heim 1955 haute couture beaded dress.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: William Vintage at Matchesfashion.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cOur ambition is to make a look for the contemporary moment, but using vintage clothes,\u201d she says. In an industry struggling to reconcile the environmental impact of clothes production with a fashion news cycle that relies on new collections to drive desire, Blanchet sees an opportunity to create a fashion brand out of pre-loved clothes. The sustainable credentials of vintage fashion are already beginning to make it an alpha choice. Amal Clooney chose a caped ivory silk gown from Jean-Louis Scherrer\u2019s 2007 collection for a black-tie event at Buckingham Palace earlier this year.</p> <p>\u201cEven five years ago, vintage was a niche thing\u201d says Blanchet. \u201cThe interest in sustainability has been tremendous because women are more conscious of the impact of what they buy. The importance of caring for our planet has democratised secondhand fashion.\u201d Vintage enthusiasts are pushing back against disposable culture. \u201cWe elongate the life of clothes, by giving them a second life,\u201d says Blanchet. And a well-chosen, decades-old secondhand dress may be a better investment, that will last longer in your wardrobe, than an off-the-rack high-street dress on sale today. \u201cIn the past, clothes were made and crafted to last, not to wear for only one season,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Crucially, vintage no longer means retro. If the notion of a vintage red-carpet dress conjures up visions of dusty corsages and twee satin sashes, take a look at the snake-hipped, emerald-sequinned one-shoulder sheath Aboah wore last week. Only the nerdiest of fashion-watchers would have spotted that the dress was 15 years old, from Tom Ford\u2019s final collection for Gucci. The \u201cultra-feminine, but modern and chic\u201d silhouette gives the dress the contemporary aura Blanchet looks for. \u201cI would never choose a piece that looked old, or dated. Believe me, I am as put off as anyone by the idea of looking retro.\u201d</p> <p>Blanchet fell for vintage as a teenager in Paris. \u201cWhen I was 15, an age when you are trying to find yourself, [watching] the John Cassavetes film Opening Night and discovering the style of Mick and Bianca Jagger \u2013 those were huge inspirations to me.\u201d The flea markets of Paris remain her favourite shopping haunts. \u201cFrench women have a notion of heritage because they learn to dress from their mothers, so they are not put off if a piece doesn\u2019t look new. They have a taste for a piece that has a story, that has lived a life already \u2013 \u201c<em>un v\u00e9cu</em>\u201d, as we say in French.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"733933d337d47f1a4ec3e9ef289fd608bc8696ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/733933d337d47f1a4ec3e9ef289fd608bc8696ea/2_0_8885_5333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christian Dior sequin feather sleeveless dress, Gianni Versace Couture ruched slit-front gown and Thierry Mugler 1980 deep V-neck cocktail dress.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christian Dior sequin feather sleeveless dress, Gianni Versace Couture ruched slit-front gown and Thierry Mugler 1980 deep V-neck cocktail dress.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: William Vintage at Matchesfashion.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Three years at Vestiaire Collective, the leading online resale site for designer fashion, honed Blanchet\u2019s style instincts.

      "bodyText": "The catwalk season has begun, and there is a new It girl in town. She is Parisian, with dark hair that tumbles in that photogenically messy way that only French women ever master. She wears a lot of black (jeans, ankle boots) and not much makeup \u2013 just a perfect red lip \u2013 and great perfume. Her look is timeless, understated and perennially chic. Think tailoring, iconic accessories and beautiful silk shirts. But Marie Blanchet is a whole new breed of fashion leader, because her look is not about new clothes. As the CEO for William Vintage, the London-based vintage label that dressed Adwoa Aboah for the GQ awards last week and sourced the 1960s Courreges trapeze coat that Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, wore for her New York baby shower, Blanchet stands for a coming age of fashion in which the kudos of the perfectly sourced secondhand piece outshines the appeal of new clothes. Blanchet\u2019s masterplan is to make William Vintage, which was founded a decade ago by the fashion connoisseur and dealer William Banks-Blaney, the first market-leading fashion brand that doesn\u2019t make any new clothes. \u201cOur ambition is to make a look for the contemporary moment, but using vintage clothes,\u201d she says. In an industry struggling to reconcile the environmental impact of clothes production with a fashion news cycle that relies on new collections to drive desire, Blanchet sees an opportunity to create a fashion brand out of pre-loved clothes. The sustainable credentials of vintage fashion are already beginning to make it an alpha choice. Amal Clooney chose a caped ivory silk gown from Jean-Louis Scherrer\u2019s 2007 collection for a black-tie event at Buckingham Palace earlier this year. \u201cEven five years ago, vintage was a niche thing\u201d says Blanchet. \u201cThe interest in sustainability has been tremendous because women are more conscious of the impact of what they buy. The importance of caring for our planet has democratised secondhand fashion.\u201d Vintage enthusiasts are pushing back against disposable culture. \u201cWe elongate the life of clothes, by giving them a second life,\u201d says Blanchet. And a well-chosen, decades-old secondhand dress may be a better investment, that will last longer in your wardrobe, than an off-the-rack high-street dress on sale today. \u201cIn the past, clothes were made and crafted to last, not to wear for only one season,\u201d she says. Crucially, vintage no longer means retro. If the notion of a vintage red-carpet dress conjures up visions of dusty corsages and twee satin sashes, take a look at the snake-hipped, emerald-sequinned one-shoulder sheath Aboah wore last week. Only the nerdiest of fashion-watchers would have spotted that the dress was 15 years old, from Tom Ford\u2019s final collection for Gucci. The \u201cultra-feminine, but modern and chic\u201d silhouette gives the dress the contemporary aura Blanchet looks for. \u201cI would never choose a piece that looked old, or dated. Believe me, I am as put off as anyone by the idea of looking retro.\u201d Blanchet fell for vintage as a teenager in Paris. \u201cWhen I was 15, an age when you are trying to find yourself, [watching] the John Cassavetes film Opening Night and discovering the style of Mick and Bianca Jagger \u2013 those were huge inspirations to me.\u201d The flea markets of Paris remain her favourite shopping haunts. \u201cFrench women have a notion of heritage because they learn to dress from their mothers, so they are not put off if a piece doesn\u2019t look new. They have a taste for a piece that has a story, that has lived a life already \u2013 \u201cun v\u00e9cu\u201d, as we say in French.\u201d Three years at Vestiaire Collective, the leading online resale site for designer fashion, honed Blanchet\u2019s style instincts. Her mantra for vintage shopping is to look for clothes that look contemporary, and align with your personality. She mixes vintage with modern pieces, preferring to buy footwear new \u2013 designer heels for evening, Converse hi-tops for day \u2013 and scours vintage stores for white cotton blouses and shirts, never buying them new. \u201cOne of my biggest obsessions is my collection of Edwardian white cotton blouses and 1900s men\u2019s shirts,\u201d she says.

In August, the Australian prime minister committed to a US-led mission to patrol the Strait of Hormuz, through which about a fifth of the world\u2019s oil passes. Scott Morrison said \u201cdestabilising behaviour\u201d \u2013 a thinly veiled reference to Iran\u2019s capture of foreign-flagged ships \u2013 was a threat to Australian interests.</p> \n<p>A spokesperson for Australia\u2019s department of foreign affairs and trade confirmed the department was providing consular assistance to the families of three Australians detained in Iran. </p> \n<p>The Australian government updated its travel advice for Iran, warning: \u201cThere is a risk that foreigners, including Australians, could be arbitrarily detained or arrested in Iran. We can\u2019t guarantee consular access if you are detained or arrested. We also can\u2019t guarantee access to legal representation.\u201d</p> \n<p>The advice also urges travellers not to visit military or nuclear sites, which, it says, \u201care not always clearly marked\u201d.</p> \n<p>An increasingly unpredictable brinkmanship has emerged between the US \u2013 and by association, its allies \u2013 and Iran since Washington withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal in May 2018. The US has pursued its \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d strategy through economic and trade sanctions, while Tehran has responded by stepping up its nuclear programme beyond the limits of the deal.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday Iran\u2019s ambassador to the UK, Hamid Baeidinejad, was summoned to the Foreign Office by the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, amid British claims that Tehran has torn up undertakings that the seized Iranian oil tanker would not sell its 2.1m barrels of oil to Syria.</p> \n<p>Britain released the ship only after receiving written undertakings from Iranian diplomats. </p> \n<p>Iran\u2019s envoy to London said on Wednesday the oil cargo of tanker Adrian Darya 1 was sold at sea to a private company, denying Tehran had broken assurances it had given over the vessel.

A female British-Australian academic who has been teaching at a university in Australia was arrested several months ago, sources confirmed to the Guardian. In an unrelated arrest several weeks ago, a British-Australian blogger and her male Australian partner were detained while travelling across the country. It is believed they were camping in a military area around Jajrood in Tehran province. The Times reported that the academic had been sentenced to 10 years in prison and was being held in solitary confinement, according to a source familiar with the case. The source also said the blogger had been told by the Iranian authorities that she was being held in order to facilitate a prisoner swap with Australia. Iran has targeted Iranian dual-national citizens in recent years, but the detention of foreign citizens who do not hold Iranian nationality is unusual. The Australian government is leading negotiations with Tehran over the conditions and potential release of all three arrested. The UK Foreign Office has been aware of the incidents for some weeks, but has asked journalists not to report them. The two women have reportedly been detained in Evin prison in Tehran, where the 41-year-old British-Iranian Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been incarcerated on spying charges since 2016. The whereabouts of the man is unknown. Boris Johnson, then the UK foreign secretary, was severely criticised over his handling of the Zaghari-Ratcliffe case after he erroneously told the Commons she was teaching journalism while in Iran. Tensions have been rising between the UK and Iran in recent months, triggered by the seizure of an Iranian tanker by the UK off Gibraltar in July. In August, the Australian prime minister committed to a US-led mission to patrol the Strait of Hormuz, through which about a fifth of the world\u2019s oil passes. Scott Morrison said \u201cdestabilising behaviour\u201d \u2013 a thinly veiled reference to Iran\u2019s capture of foreign-flagged ships \u2013 was a threat to Australian interests. A spokesperson for Australia\u2019s department of foreign affairs and trade confirmed the department was providing consular assistance to the families of three Australians detained in Iran. The Australian government updated its travel advice for Iran, warning: \u201cThere is a risk that foreigners, including Australians, could be arbitrarily detained or arrested in Iran. We can\u2019t guarantee consular access if you are detained or arrested. We also can\u2019t guarantee access to legal representation.\u201d The advice also urges travellers not to visit military or nuclear sites, which, it says, \u201care not always clearly marked\u201d. An increasingly unpredictable brinkmanship has emerged between the US \u2013 and by association, its allies \u2013 and Iran since Washington withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal in May 2018. The US has pursued its \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d strategy through economic and trade sanctions, while Tehran has responded by stepping up its nuclear programme beyond the limits of the deal. On Wednesday Iran\u2019s ambassador to the UK, Hamid Baeidinejad, was summoned to the Foreign Office by the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, amid British claims that Tehran has torn up undertakings that the seized Iranian oil tanker would not sell its 2.1m barrels of oil to Syria. Britain released the ship only after receiving written undertakings from Iranian diplomats. Iran\u2019s envoy to London said on Wednesday the oil cargo of tanker Adrian Darya 1 was sold at sea to a private company, denying Tehran had broken assurances it had given over the vessel. He also insisted any EU\u2019s sanctions on exports to Syria did not apply to Tehran. The UK remains committed to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, despite pressure from the US to pull out, and is privately supporting Donald Trump in his efforts to hold a summit with the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, at the UN general assembly in New York. The British MP Tulip Siddiq said: \u201cIran have raised the stakes again and shown the UK\u2019s soft diplomatic responses to Iran\u2019s illegal and inhumane treatment of British prisoners has not worked. This is a wake-up call for the prime minister and the government to act urgently to bring our innocent citizens home.\u201d Alistair Burt, a former minister in the UK foreign office, told the BBC that \u201chostage-taking\u201d appears to have become part of Iranian policy. \u201cIt makes it very difficult for those who want a different relationship with Iran to get on the front foot with those who regard it as unremittingly hostile,\u201d he added. According to the Center for Human Rights in Iran, at least 12 dual and foreign nationals or Iranian citizens with foreign permanent residences were known to be imprisoned in the country as of July 2019. Most hold Iranian citizenship alongside another nationality, but Tehran does not recognise dual citizenship and these prisoners are routinely denied access to embassy officials from their other country of nationality. The centre said there was a pattern to the arrest of foreign nationals, involving prolonged solitary confinement and interrogations, a lack of due legal process and access to counsel, and a denial of consular access or visits by the UN or humanitarian organisations. It is understood that at least one of the British-Australian women being detained has had meetings with Australian consular officials.",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has been publicly offered a non-aggression pact by Nigel Farage if he signs up fully to a no-deal departure from the EU and the Conservatives stand aside in more than 80 seats, amid signs the prime minister could be considering softer options for a deal with Brussels. The Brexit party leader urged the prime minister to strike an agreement to stand jointly in favour of no deal, at a time of increasing speculation that Johnson is revisiting ways of making a version of Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement work. Johnson insists he is not proposing a Northern Ireland-only backstop, which EU leaders hope he could move towards, as that would not be acceptable to the Democratic Unionist party. However, the idea of an all-Ireland agrifood zone of regulatory alignment as part of the solution was discussed on Tuesday by Johnson and Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, as long as it did not extend to an all-Ireland customs area with a tariff border in the Irish Sea. The idea would not be enough to satisfy Brussels that the backstop is no longer necessary, but the discussions were taken as a sign that Johnson is more focused than ever on finding solutions to the Irish border problem. A No 10 spokesman said Johnson rejected the idea of an alliance with Farage, saying he \u201chas been clear \u2013 no pact\u201d. It comes as the Sun reported that Johnson recently claimed to anti-no-deal Tory rebels that ultimately the hardline Eurosceptic Conservatives would be the ones putting \u201cspears in my back\u201d when they realise he is prepared to make a compromise on a deal. The prime minister also told cabinet he was fundamentally liberal and should be regarded as a \u201cBrexity Hezza\u201d\u2013 a reference to the former deputy prime minister Michael Heseltine. Andrea Leadsom, the business secretary, did not deny Johnson was looking at softer options for a deal on Wednesday morning, as she appeared on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cWe are looking at creative ways to ensure no Irish backstop,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are looking at getting a good deal that works for the UK that is different to existing one.\u201d However, Farage is preparing to exploit any move by Johnson towards a return to May\u2019s withdrawal deal, which the prime minister had promised his supporters was dead and that the backstop must be completely removed. The Brexit party took out a full-page advert in the Sun and a wraparound ad in the Daily Express, setting out its terms for a hard Brexit alliance to take on tactical voting among supporters of the pro-referendum parties. Farage would pledge to give the Tories a clear run at all their existing seats and targets if the Brexit party were to get a similar deal in 80-90 constituencies. Johnson would also have to sign up unequivocally to a no-deal departure. He challenged Johnson: \u201cIf you have the courage for a clean-break Brexit, then we will help you secure a big Brexit majority. Together we can destroy Corbyn\u2019s Labour\u201d. Farage\u2019s high-profile adverts appear designed to publicise his harder Brexit position than Johnson in the months before a possible election, with little chance that the prime minister could accept such a high price for a pact. However, most recent polling suggests the Conservatives would be short of a majority with Farage\u2019s Brexit party eating into his vote and the possibility of pro-referendum parties \u2013 Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the SNP and others \u2013 potentially able to cobble together a majority for a remain alliance.",

I think some of it needs to be focused on what you call unwritten law on the exercise of discretions on the conventions which have surrounded the way in which, just to take a simple example, section 70 and 79 of the Crimes Act 1914, have been there since the first world war, have manifested. What\u2019s happened to them? On the face of them, they criminalise a lot of journalistic activity. They criminalise the publication when the journalist know that is it is a leak from government. But no journalist has been prosecuted for that in the more than 100 years which have gone past. And you have to ask the question is why is that so? It\u2019s so because of the way in which governments exercise discretions and apply conventions to make sure that journalists and ordinary media work in this country is protected.</p> </blockquote> <p>So Dreyfus seems to be suggesting instead of changing laws, governments should just stop complaining to the cops about some non-critical leaks.<br></p> <p>Dreyfus also opposed a blanket exemption for journalists to national security disclosure laws. He downplayed expectations around the PJCIS review, suggesting the report would likely be \u201crather securitised\u201d, by which I assume he meant opaque, technical or not expansive.

I imagine that that\u2019s going to be part of the debate because some people are expressing that view \u2013 but speaking for myself, I think that there\u2019s a number of groups in the Australian community that have suffered discrimination because of their religious belief, and the community that most springs to mind in recent years would be the Muslim community among us, who directly suffer discrimination in employment and the provision of services.</p> <p>I think that it\u2019s absolutely a worthwhile innovation that the attorney general has produced to add this additional ground of discrimination to our existing set of anti-discrimination laws. </p> <p>Precisely how that\u2019s going to be done is the argument that\u2019s ahead of us.

There\u2019s a question raised by this legislation as to whether or not at the federal level we should have that as well. </p> <p>And one of the questions that\u2019s going to need to be resolved, as it always has been when a new anti-discrimination statute is produced, is how that new anti-discrimination statute needs to interact with the existing anti-discrimination statutes. </p> <p>This is something that international human rights has dealt with and political rights deals with directly. It\u2019s where you have potentially conflicting rights. </p> <p>And the resolution of that conflict or competition between rights is the subject matter of the debate. We have seen bits of it so far in the commitment that the prime minister made during the Wentworth byelection, for example, to abolish the exemption that\u2019s there for religious schools to discriminate against students and children in those schools \u2013 that\u2019s unresolved, of course, because the prime minister didn\u2019t keep that promise, and still hasn\u2019t. </p> <p>[That] perhaps demonstrates the degree of difficulty, but that\u2019s the issue that\u2019s going to have to be resolved. </p> <p>The issue raised by your question is going to have to be revolved when we come to debating the legislation that the government says it\u2019s bringing forward.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-11T04:03:00.448Z\">at 5.03am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d7867cb8f08143ee1ae3fc2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-11T03:20:14.897Z\">4.20am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Sighhhhhhhhh</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Paul_Karp/status/1171623691135803392\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Mark Dreyfus refuses to recommit to principle <a href=\"https://twitter.com/billshortenmp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@billshortenmp</a> established that Labor won&#39;t vote to water down protections of LGBT Australians.

The government wants to roll this out nationally. 80 per cent of money is quarantined in that for rent and food. The government says it works. Has the Labor party got a position on that yet?</p> <p><strong>LB</strong>: The Labor party does have a position. We\u2019ve had a position for some time on the cashless welfare card<strong>. And that is that if a community has proper consultation and proper consent, and the community wants the card, then Labor would not stand in the way. But we do not support a national rollout of this card.</strong> It goes to whether or not it\u2019s effective.

Is it unlawful, yes or sure no?</p> <p><strong>Liu:</strong> Well, as I said, I want to make sure that Australians interests were put first and foremost and if it\u2019s going to affect our trade or our air travelling, then that is something that I would not support.</p> <p><strong>Bolt:</strong> Well, in fact, it does affect our trade, 60% of it goes through that sea. We have been warned by China to stay away. We are thinking of challenging that with our navy, and you are here not able to actually support the government\u2019s position that it was unlawful. Is there some problem with you agreeing that it was unlawful? It has been held so under international law. Why are you not going along with that?</p> <p><strong>Liu:</strong> Well, I never said that I\u2019m not going along with it. What I\u2019m saying is I always put Australia\u2019s interests first. After all, I am a member of parliament for the Australian government and so of course I will put Australia\u2019s interests first and whatever \u2013 as I said in my maiden speech too, I will always want to have a good relationship between Australia and China and I will put Australia\u2019s interests first.</p> <p>Before revelations the former Labor senator <strong>Sam Dastyari </strong>had warned a donor he may be under surveillance by security agencies, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/nov/29/sam-dastyari-senator-recorded-contradicting-labor-on-south-china-sea\">the government had called for his sacking after reports he contradicted Labor</a> \u2013 and the government\u2019s \u2013 position on the dispute.

      "bodyText": "With Wednesday having delivered the visual of the deputy prime minister throwing his John Deere out of the cot, we are going to call it a night and await, feverishly, what Thursday will deliver. Will Michael McCormack remain spicy, or return to a more stale ham sandwich sort of vibe? That, my friends, is the magic and mystery of the 46th parliament. In all seriousness, Thursday shouldn\u2019t be quite as frantic, because there is another sitting next week and the government needs to stretch out that legislation cupboard as long as possible. A big thank-you to Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Paul Karp and Sarah Martin for keeping my fires burning, and to all those in the Guardian brains trust who come along and make me make sense. As always though, the biggest thank-you goes to you for coming along with us. We appreciate you for choosing to spend part of your day with us as we navigate this place and its shenanigans. I hope you can all switch off for a bit now. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll be doing \u2013 at least until early tomorrow morning. As always though \u2013 take care of you. Just a quick note on the Coalition\u2019s proposed integrity commission. The shadow attorney-general, Mark Dreyfus, today criticised the government for its lack of progress on establishing a federal integrity commission, something it promised to do in late 2018. Dreyfus said the proposal was not even on the government\u2019s published legislative agenda for 2019. But attorney-general, Christian Porter, has reaffirmed the government\u2019s intention to finalise a bill by the end of the year. In a statement to AAP, Porter said the draft was currently being prepared and would be released for public consultation once ready. \u201dThe experience at the state level has been that this is the worst possible area in which to engage in policy on the run,\u201d Porter said. \u201cThis is one area where the hard detailed work must come before the headlines.\u201d The Coalition\u2019s proposal has faced significant criticism for its weaknesses. It will be unable to hold public hearings into public sector corruption, cannot take tip-offs from the general public, requires a high threshold of evidence before investigations can begin, and will be unable to make findings of corrupt conduct. Critics say it has been set up in a way that effectively shields politicians. The Greens have proposed a stronger model and passed legislation through the Senate on Monday with the support of Labor and parts of the crossbench. The Greens will face a difficult task in getting their legislation before the lower house. Sam Dastyari is standing on the middle of a street, being broadcast into the Sky studios, for an interview with David Speers. It\u2019s ... interesting and very Sam-Dastyari-hasn\u2019t-seen-the-cameras-for-a-while. His point is that he made the right decision to step down when he did and thinks that Gladys Liu should be held to the same standard he was. New Labor SA senator Marielle Smith is delivering her first speech: I have been fortunate throughout my life to be surrounded by strong, passionate and remarkable women. I\u2019ve been fortunate beyond words to have the mentorship of two in particular who have travelled from Adelaide to support me today. To Kate Ellis, a great trailblazer of our movement and parliament. Simply, and on many levels, I would not be in this place without you and all that you have done for me. And to Julia Gillard, whose contribution to this place, and legacy to our country, is immeasurable. Julia, your belief in me has been sustaining, your advocacy humbling, and your friendship is one of the most cherished I have ever and will ever have. I promise to make you proud here. Asked if he had watched the Andrew Bolt interview with Gladys Liu, Barnaby Joyce told Patricia Karvelas he had. His verdict? Everyone has a bad day in the office and that was one. I mean, he would know. Thousands of mature-age students \u2013 including Newstart recipients, single parents and the disabled \u2013 would have their welfare payments slashed under a revived Morrison government plan. On Thursday, the Coalition re-introduced legislation to parliament that would effectively reduce two top-up welfare payments received by older students who do not study full-time. The changes, which would save the budget $80 million, mean a person studying part-time would get half the annual $208 education entry payment rather than the full amount. The $62.40 a week pensioner education supplement will also be tightened. It comes as the Coalition pushes ahead with plans to drug-test welfare recipients and expand the cashless debit card to the North Territory, and as it refuses to heed calls to lift the rate of Newstart allowance. The Australian Council of Social Service (Acoss), which opposes the bill, says 56,100 people \u2013 mostly disability support pensioners and people receiving parenting payment single and carer payments \u2013 would be impacted by the cuts to the education entry payment. Changes to the pensioner education supplement would impact about 39,700 people who would no longer receive this payment during university semester breaks, Acoss says, while about 30,000 would have these fortnightly payments cut in half because they study part-time. The Department of Social Services previously told 9,629 Newstart recipients also received one or both of these two supplementary payments. The government consistently points to supplementary payments as a reason why Newstart does not need to be raised. The bill, which also bars students studying overseas from receiving the Relocation Scholarship, to save a further $1.9 million, was rejected by the Senate in the previous parliament. You may notice here the lack of reaction from Scott Morrison to his deputy having a complete and utter meltdown at the despatch box. I mean, a cynic would think that some sort of distraction was ... almost ... planned. In all seriousness though, what was that hour? Well, if one of your MPs has done a trainwreck interview, against advice, which has made them the story, at a time when you are attempting to play as beige as possible, and you know question time is coming up, what do you do? Attempt to divert attention. Michael McCormack just McCormacked his bit, but you had Peter Dutton twice, giving his best Dutton, Christian Porter doing his Porter, and Josh Frydenberg ramping up both the yelling and class clown act. The problem is, it doesn\u2019t seem like the government QT strategists considered that most of the questions would be ruled out of order. So the distraction became the main show. And, well, you saw the result. How Mike Bowers saw the rest of the Michael McCormack snaps hour: When you ask for meat and three veg, and get onion. Question time ends. As does my will to keep typing. But Oma didn\u2019t raise no quitter, so we keep on. For a visual of what is not happening in question time today All of this Mark Dreyfus to Scott Morrison: Doesn\u2019t matter, it is ruled out of order. Someone is feeling a bit more comfortable Labor senator Nita Green has continued to push the Coalition on the Biloela Tamil family, noting in Senate question time that Nationals MPs Ken O\u2019Dowd and Barnaby Joyce, independent Helen Haines and conservative broadcaster Alan Jones have all called for the family to stay. The government leader in the Senate, Mathias Cormann, responded by arguing Labor has been inconsistent on the point: \u201cI refer to the statement of the deputy prime minister [Anthony Albanese] in 2013 that nobody who arrives in Australia by boat without a visa will be permanently settled. We are committed to protecting the integrity of our borders, and preventing vulnerable people being subjected to the vile trade of the people smugglers.\u201d So that was a no, they won\u2019t be allowed to stay. As my colleague Helen Davidson has noted in this factcheck, the idea that nobody after the July 2013 deadline would be allowed to stay is demonstrably false \u2013 as Guardian Australia reported in July, Peter Dutton himself has allowed at least one accompanied minor refugee to stay. But, as Cormann notes, the Biloela family have been found not to be refugees. Anthony Albanese asks Christian Porter when the government will introduce its national integrity commission legislation. Porter says the government is making its way through it. He then says the phrase \u201cflip flop\u201d about a million times (time moves slowly in this place) in relation to Albanese. That\u2019s one of Peter Dutton and Scott Morrison\u2019s favourites as well, as they try and get it happening. I don\u2019t have enough can\u2019ts to even. All I can say is student politics has a lot to answer for. Mark Dreyfus to Scott Morrison: Did the minister for home affairs\u2019 actions meet the high standards expected of ministers under ministerial standards, given an ABC report that the minister for home affairs had a lunch with a man arranged by a lobbyist who called the minister one of his best friends, and said he could arrange access to the minister\u2019s office for $20,000, and has the prime minister taken any steps to investigate that report? Morrison: Thank you, Mr Speaker. The declarations that are made in relation to donations are set out on the public record. I want to make something very clear. When I was talking about money changing hands, I wasn\u2019t talking about donations. I was talking about expenses that were picked up personally by Senator Dastyari, by Senator Dastyari personally, his legal expenses and his travel expenses. I have made no reference, Mr Speaker, to donations. Donations should be declared in the ordinary course of business, and they are, and they should be transparent, and that is the case here, Mr Speaker. Mark Dreyfus to Scott Morrison: Can the prime minister explain why it was proper for the Liberal National party to accept a donation from the CEO of Brisbane-based company Canstruct which resulted in a lucrative contract. It is ruled out of order. Tony Smith says it is about the third one in a row, and if he thinks that this is an attempt to raise issues Labor knows will be out of order, he will cut off the question. One of the points that is well-established is that ministers and prime ministers are not responsible for political parties\u2019 statements by members, by ministers, obviously, occurrences and party rooms, and a range of statements. I won\u2019t keep repeating myself, it is clear. The question is out of order. Tony Burke says the prime minister opened the door for the question, by giving an answer to the House yesterday about donations, which should allow the question. Smith says the question didn\u2019t actually address that. Certainly members\u2019 statements can be referred to. I mean, that\u2019s a well-established precedent, I couldn\u2019t stop that. But just because the prime minister has made a statement, it doesn\u2019t allow the member for Isaacs to ask whatever he feels like. And let\u2019s be frank here, we are all politicians. I am ruling the question is out of order, and there doesn\u2019t seem to be, you know, any upset or outrage from my left. I mean, let\u2019s just call a spade a spade. Sorry, I should have corrected that. I don\u2019t... (The government side goes nuts.) Let me correct my statement. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any outrage or upset from those on my left to know what they are doing. Awwwww Peter Dutton gets another opportunity to smile, with another lickspittle on JUST HOW SAFE ARE WE. tl;dr \u2013 VERY. BUT JUST IMAGINE IF PETER DUTTON AND THE MORRISON GOVERNMENT DIDN\u2019T WIN THE ELECTION. Mark Dreyfus to Scott Morrison: I refer to his comments in the House yesterday and today, the front page headline of the Daily Telegraph... Why does he promise to go over the top when he sees political advantage, but go into hiding when there is Liberal party corruption in his own party members are breaking the law? (he holds up a front page) Tony Smith: The member for Isaacs will not use props, the question is out of order, it offends. Ministers could stop interject! The member for Sydney is warned. If the member for Isaacs is having difficulty, I suggest he acquaint himself with pages 553 and 554, a practice that outlines a whole list of elements that ministers can\u2019t be question on, and he offended five of them. At the National Press Club, Mark Dreyfus gave some hints about his thinking on press freedom \u2013 which is significant because he is a Labor member of the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security examining the issue. Dreyfus suggested the raids on the ABC and Annika Smethurst were \u201ca product, not of the laws which have been in place for very, very many years, but of the way that this government has chosen to go about demanding that leaks are investigated\u201d. Dreyfus said: I\u2019ve been a bit concerned about some of the public commentary in this area because it\u2019s been so focused on black letter law. I think some of it needs to be focused on what you call unwritten law on the exercise of discretions on the conventions which have surrounded the way in which, just to take a simple example, section 70 and 79 of the Crimes Act 1914, have been there since the first world war, have manifested. What\u2019s happened to them? On the face of them, they criminalise a lot of journalistic activity. They criminalise the publication when the journalist know that is it is a leak from government. But no journalist has been prosecuted for that in the more than 100 years which have gone past. And you have to ask the question is why is that so? It\u2019s so because of the way in which governments exercise discretions and apply conventions to make sure that journalists and ordinary media work in this country is protected. So Dreyfus seems to be suggesting instead of changing laws, governments should just stop complaining to the cops about some non-critical leaks. Dreyfus also opposed a blanket exemption for journalists to national security disclosure laws. He downplayed expectations around the PJCIS review, suggesting the report would likely be \u201crather securitised\u201d, by which I assume he meant opaque, technical or not expansive. He suggested a separate Senate review might be more fruitful. Christian Porter delivers the \u2018unions are terrible\u2019 lickspittle. Mark Dreyfus to Scott Morrison: I refer to the prime minister\u2019s previous answer where he said the test was whether money had changed hands. I refer to the responsibility for the AEC and its role in political parties, and I refer to the article in the Herald Sun by James Campbell that the Liberal party returned $300,000 in donations from dinner guests associated with the member for Chisholm because of security concerns, and to the member for Chisholm\u2019s statement last night that the donation and its return was all made up. Prime minister, is she correct? Tony Smith moves to rule the question out of order, given the PM doesn\u2019t have any responsibility for the AEC. Morrison wants to answer it. \u201cOn indulgence?\u201d he asks Smith. Tony Burke and Christian Porter both make their arguments \u2013 Porter, seeing that Morrison wants to answer the question, just asks for a small tweak. Smith rules the question out of order. Peter Dutton has waited very patiently for almost 24 hours and now gets to give the answer to the lickspittle he had lined up yesterday, after Andrew Hastie says the magic words \u201calternative approaches\u201d. \u201cGive us a smile,\u201d Labor backbenchers call out. It is, after all, a year after Dutton told us all he wanted was to smile more. But Dutton is never happier than when he gets to talk about how terrible Labor is, unless of course it is talking about how terrible unions are. He gives the answer he prepared yesterday. Mark Dreyfus to Scott Morrison: When Sam Dastyari failed to support the bipartisan position on the South China Sea, the prime minister said Sam Dastyari has been caught betraying his country, and that means he is betraying every patriotic Australian in this country. Does the prime minister stand by that statement, and the standard it sets? Will the prime minister apply this test to the member for Chisholm? Tony Smith allows the question. I further comment on the statement by the member for Chisholm today which makes it very clear her support for the government\u2019s position. The prime minister can pause for a second. I have made it clear I need to listen to the question, because I need to make rulings on these matters. I am going to listen to the answer without interjection. Prime minister. Morrison: Thank you, Mr Speaker. So I refer the member to her statement which makes it very clear about her support for the government\u2019s position in the long-standing position we have taken in relation to those matters. What the member has raised with me is the conduct of the former senator, Sam Dastyari. Now, what he will remember about Senator Sam Dastyari is, not only, Mr Speaker, not only was he a minister, shadow minister, I should say, in the executive of the opposition at that time, he seems to forget the fact that money changed hands between then senator Sam Dastyari... Money changed hands... ... And his position was bought by that, Mr Speaker, with a concession alone, with alone, I should say, to off his legal expenses, and he was caught in his own web of corruption, Mr Speaker. He should have resigned, and he did. Goodness. Michael McCormack just got so worked up during that previous lickspittle, he shifted from 11-4001 TPG to 11- 4801 TPG on the Pantone colour chart. Mark Dreyfus to Scott Morrison: What steps did the prime minister take to ensure that the member for Chisholm is a fit and proper person to sit in the Australian parliament? Tony Smith immediately rules it out of order, before Christian Porter is even fully out of his seat. That question is out of order. It doesn\u2019t go to the prime minister\u2019s responsibilities at all. We move to another lickspittle, which Josh Frydenberg is very excited to answer, particularly about whether or not he knows of any \u201calternative policies\u201d. He still doesn\u2019t seem to realise that the Liberals won the election. And have been in power since 2013. It\u2019s been 116 or so days \u2013 can someone please tell Josh Frydenberg he won the election? Tanya Plibersek to Scott Morrison: The Australian Industry Group warns the nation has a skills crisis, 75% of businesses struggling to find qualified Australians to fill jobs. Why has this government ripped $3bn from Tafe in training and done nothing to stop the loss of 150,000 apprenticeships and traineeships? Morrison: Mr Speaker, between 2011 and 2013, when the member for Sydney was sitting around a cabinet table, Labor cut employer incentives to businesses, nine times, that totalled 1.2 million. The member would be fully aware Tafe is funded by state government, not commonwealth governments. That is why last year, I initiated a review conducted by Stephen Joyce. That review found the funding and spending going into skills education, every year, was not getting the results, the results they were not getting was that people weren\u2019t being trained with the skills, for the skills needed by the employers who wanted to employ them. That\u2019s because of the outdated funding model, the process is put in place over many years, run by previous governments, these other things we need to fix and this is what we intend to fix. Michael McCormack appears to have sprinkled too much sugar on his Weet-Bix this morning, as he gets very worked up at Joel Fitzgibbon over not caring about farmers. He screams that Fitzgibbon is \u201ca disgrace\u201d. Fitzgibbon gets upset. The chamber is upset, but at different things. It\u2019s amazing what happens when salt is added to bland carbohydrates. Michael McCormack is attempting to act like a politician. It\u2019s going about as well as you would expect. Tanya Plibersek to Scott Morrison: As Plibersek is announced, a small cheer goes up from the government benches: The number of Australians doing an apprenticeship or traineeship is lower than it was a decade ago. Why has this government cut $3bn from Tafe and training? Morrison: I have learnt when the member for Sydney puts forward figures they can never be taken at face value. At the last election our government committed to 80,000 new apprentices, as the government program has been wound out, 2000 people have taken up the program. We look forward to further success. Plibersek attempts to table the document which shows the cuts, but is denied. Luckily, there is already a press release on that lickspittle, for those who need the information (and given the fires, there will be some of you), so here it is: Disaster-hit communities will be back on their feet faster, with the Government introducing legislation for a new $4 billion future fund. The Emergency Response Fund will grow to up to $6.6 billion over the next decade. ...The type of assistance provided could include, but is not limited to, recovery project grants, service provision, adoption of technology helping recover and resilience or economic aid packages for affected communities or industry sectors to help build their resilience to future natural disasters. The Fund will be managed by the Future Fund Board of Guardians. The Board has a proven track record of managing investment portfolios on behalf of Government and maximising returns over the long term. Phil Thompson gets the first lickspittle of the day, but given he has tomato sauce on his bacon and egg roll instead of barbecue (and hot sauce if you are me), I can\u2019t listen to anything he says. Question time begins and we are straight into it. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question is addressed to the prime minister. Can he confirm wages have grown more slowly than the last 38 consecutive forecasts? Morrison: I can confirm when it comes to wages growth, and the most recent quarter, it was 0.7%. I can confirm, in the September quarter of 2018 when we came to office it was 0.5%. Wage growth was higher than what we inherited from the Labor party. Scott Morrison on prostate cancer: But the message today is pretty simple, blokes \u2013 don\u2019t muck about with your health. If, like me, you\u2019ve hit the big 50 then you\u2019ve absolutely got to get on to it straight away and must be getting on to it much sooner than that. Go and talk to your doctor. I did that last Friday as part of my usual check-up and did the usual thing in making sure that these issues were totally sussed out. That\u2019s what we all should be doing on a regular basis. Go to your doctor, know the risks, get the test. Treat it like your life depends on it. Because it does. And it\u2019s important that we appreciate that. And if you can\u2019t do it for yourself, do it for your family, do it for your kids, do it for those who love you. Because you know how much you love them. And you should understand that they love you just as much, and they want you around for as long as possible. It\u2019s almost question time. Put your predictions down below As Sarah Martin, who has had a read through the drug testing bill, has pointed out, the government is not releasing the cost of the trial. The financial impact of these amendments is not for publication. That\u2019s despite the front page in yesterday\u2019s Daily Telegraph saying up to $65,000 would be available for those determined to need referrals. Also, it just appears to apply to those on a \u201cjob seekers\u201d payment (which will become the new Newstart term) or youth allowance. No other welfare appears to be included. You can find the whole bill here. Someone has been paying attention: Does Mark Dreyfus see any reason for a religious discrimination act? Dreyfus: Some of the public commentary and some of the submissions, Senator Lambie, for example, the day before yesterday, expressed the view that the legislation wasn\u2019t necessary at all. I imagine that that\u2019s going to be part of the debate because some people are expressing that view \u2013 but speaking for myself, I think that there\u2019s a number of groups in the Australian community that have suffered discrimination because of their religious belief, and the community that most springs to mind in recent years would be the Muslim community among us, who directly suffer discrimination in employment and the provision of services. I think that it\u2019s absolutely a worthwhile innovation that the attorney general has produced to add this additional ground of discrimination to our existing set of anti-discrimination laws. Precisely how that\u2019s going to be done is the argument that\u2019s ahead of us. But I hear the voices that have said, \u2018What\u2019s the need for this?\u2019, or, \u2018Why are we doing this?\u2019 Other voices saying the reason we\u2019re having the discussion is because of what occurred in the same-sex marriage debate. Put that to one side, there\u2019s been calls now for a long time for a new ground of discrimination based on religious belief. Four states of the commonwealth have acted to create that ground of discrimination. I\u2019m very happy we\u2019re having that debate at the federal level now. The whole question and answer exchange is here: Paul Karp: In the context of the marriage debate, Bill Shorten gave a very simple commitment that Labor would not vote for legislation that watered down the protection of LGBT Australians. Now, I know the religious discrimination bill is just an exposure draft and I know Labor is still consulting about it, but will you recommit today that Labor will not vote to water down existing protections in state and federal discrimination law? And if not, why is that principle no longer a red line for Labor? Mark Dreyfus: Well, I don\u2019t want to give an absolutely clear answer to Paul\u2019s excellent question. It\u2019s one of the questions raised by the exposure draft bills that Christian Porter released about 10 days ago. The reason I don\u2019t is that, as I said publicly as recently as yesterday at a press conference that Paul asked me a similar question about, I said these are exposure drafts. Labor\u2019s now consulting on those exposure drafts and when the government resolves on whatever final position it gets to and introduces legislation to the parliament, that will be the time for Labor to form a final view of whether the legislation that the government has introduced to the parliament is an appropriate change to Australia\u2019s anti-discrimination law. One thing I can say, though, is that we have longstanding Labor values in this area. Labor is committed to the elimination of all forms of discrimination in our community. We have shown that since 1975, when we enacted the Racial Discrimination Act, through to the Sex Discrimination Act through to the Disability Discrimination Act, another Labor enactment, and then supporting the Howard government when it enacted the Age Discrimination Act. Those are the four acts of the Australian parliament that set up the anti-discrimination framework that governs conduct in Australia today. We look carefully at the other provisions that have been enacted at the state level, because one of the parts of the debate prompted by the exposure drafts that Christian Porter has produced is whether or not, in addition to the existing framework of the four acts, there should also be a new attribute protected against discrimination, namely religious belief. Four states already have such a protected attribute in their anti-discrimination frameworks. There\u2019s a question raised by this legislation as to whether or not at the federal level we should have that as well. And one of the questions that\u2019s going to need to be resolved, as it always has been when a new anti-discrimination statute is produced, is how that new anti-discrimination statute needs to interact with the existing anti-discrimination statutes. This is something that international human rights has dealt with and political rights deals with directly. It\u2019s where you have potentially conflicting rights. And the resolution of that conflict or competition between rights is the subject matter of the debate. We have seen bits of it so far in the commitment that the prime minister made during the Wentworth byelection, for example, to abolish the exemption that\u2019s there for religious schools to discriminate against students and children in those schools \u2013 that\u2019s unresolved, of course, because the prime minister didn\u2019t keep that promise, and still hasn\u2019t. [That] perhaps demonstrates the degree of difficulty, but that\u2019s the issue that\u2019s going to have to be resolved. The issue raised by your question is going to have to be revolved when we come to debating the legislation that the government says it\u2019s bringing forward. Sighhhhhhhhh Cory Bernardi has been unable to file his weekly \u201ccommonsense\u201d missive to supporters, because he is \u201cunder the pump in Canberra\u201d. Given what the Senate is dealing with this week, he may be the only one, but I guess we all handle transitions differently. Or in this case, approaching a transition. On the ongoing Labor review, and what may happen to some of the policies of the last six years, Mark Dreyfus says this: I\u2019m not going to pre-empt the outcome first of all of the review being conducted by eminent former figures of the Labor party. That review is going to report to the party later in the year. And this will be an ongoing debate in the Labor party, as it should be after an election defeat. It\u2019s an election defeat where the government increased its majority by precisely one seat, moving from having a one-seat majority after the 2016 election to a two-seat majority after the 2019 election. But it\u2019s an election result which has caused shock right across Australia because of the deep expectation that Labor was going to win the election. We do have to review the way in which we campaigned; we do have to review the policies we took to the people at the last election. That\u2019s an entirely appropriate process for us to be engaging in. And might I say \u2013 we are not going to win the 2022 election by making announcements right here and now \u2013 or for me to make an announcement at the Press Club of what our policies are going to be. One of the striking things, I would say, about the last election was just the way in which the winning party, the one that won a majority of seats, 77 seats in the parliament, in their Coalition, was able to go from the knifing of a prime minister for the second time in five years to a just winning position in May of 2019. But it does tell you something about the speed in which things can change in Australian politics and the closeness to the election that changes a position that might be able to be achieved. Could everyone who is commenting on some of the issues today take a breath and think about the origins of their comments, and how it may be coming across. Not all racism is intentional, but it still needs to be called out. I don\u2019t need comments defending some of the terms or nicknames. Just think about it, before posting. And if it doesn\u2019t apply to you, cool. Enact one of the most golden social media rules \u2013 if it doesn\u2019t fit, let it slip. Moving on. This is either \u201cfarmers don\u2019t take drugs\u201d or \u201cif farmers take drugs we don\u2019t care\u201d, because not all welfare is equal, apparently. If the point is to try and find drug problems and help people defeat them, shouldn\u2019t everyone be involved? And here are Mark Dreyfus\u2019s problems with the government\u2019s proposal for a national integrity commission: The government\u2019s model proposes a body with two wings \u2013 one wing is essentially the existing Australian Commission for Law Enforcement and Integrity, with a few new departments brought under its jurisdiction. The second wing is designed to cover politicians, their staff, and the commonwealth public service. The government proposes vastly different powers for the two wings, which would be in effect two different bodies. The ACLEI wing would retain all its previous investigatory powers and the ability to hold public hearings \u2013 although notably it has not held a single public hearing since its foundation in 2006. The second wing, however, would be far more limited: It can not self-start inquiries or act on tip-offs from the public, as it must rely on referrals of allegations of serious or corrupt conduct from agency heads. How that will work in the case of politicians is unclear. It can not hold public hearings, full-stop. It can not make findings of corruption \u2013 instead it will simply determine whether any case is strong enough to refer to the CDPP. It can not investigate serious misconduct due to the threshold for investigation being set at a reasonable suspicion that the conduct in question constitutes a criminal offence. It will not have the power to seize evidence nor conduct surveillance \u2013 powers that have proved key to several cases in state-based anti-corruption systems ... As the prime minister might put it, \u201chow good is a national integrity commission that can\u2019t investigate anything that embarrasses my government?\u201d. (He did a voice for that) Mark Dreyfus acknowledges the NSW Labor situation in his speech: There has been a great deal in the news recently about the conduct of individuals in the NSW Labor party in relation to election donations, aired at the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption. Other matters at Icac over recent years have resulted in the resignation of some 11 Liberal party MPs, and just this morning we read that another Liberal minister has serious questions to answer. Without prejudging any possible findings of the current investigation, let me make an unequivocal statement, and that is that Labor stands for integrity, accountability and transparency in government. And that we do not tolerate misconduct, whether in government, business or unions. In keeping with this guiding principle we have always worked to foster a culture of integrity in government. And in opposition. And if misconduct does occur, action must be taken. Not just action against the individual or individuals involved, but serious action to ensure that such conduct never occurs again. Gladys Liu is putting her statement out via twitter: Labor\u2019s new senator from South Australia, Marielle Smith, will make her first speech in the Senate later this afternoon. There will be one or two very familiar faces in the gallery as she delivers it \u2013 Smith worked with former prime minister Julia Gillard on delivering a global education policy for about five years. Kate Ellis is a big supporter as well. Mark Dreyfus is delivering the National Press Club address on the need for a national integrity commission: The proof of the government\u2019s lack of commitment to integrity and hence, the title of my speech, Time\u2019s Up!, is that more than 20 months after Labor\u2019s announcement that we would establish a national integrity commission, and more than eight months after the Liberal government announced the same commitment, we still don\u2019t have, from the government, so much as an exposure draft for legislation to establish such a body. Indeed, legislation to establish such a body is not even on the government\u2019s published legislative plan for the rest of this year. And this is despite the fact that at the time of the December press conference, the government claimed to have been working on legislation since January 2018. It seems Mr Morrison\u2019s statement in November that ensuring integrity in government is a \u2018fringe issue\u2019 continues to be an accurate statement of his view on this matter. You have to ask just how serious this government is about a national integrity commission when 10 months after announcing the need for one and putting out a discussion paper, there is no proposal before the parliament, and no sign it\u2019s even on the government\u2019s agenda for the rest of this year. We have a government that is obsessed with a bill about unions that they have called \u2018ensuring integrity\u2019. But the same government adamantly refuses to ensure its own integrity can be put under scrutiny. This piece from Michelle Grattan was interesting. Russell Broadbent has also been pushing the government to end mandatory detention. A spokesman for foreign minister Marise Payne has confirmed Australia is assisting families of three Australians who have been detained in Iran: The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is providing consular assistance to the families of three Australians detained in Iran. Due to our privacy obligations, we will not comment further. All Australian citizens and holders of dual nationality with Australia who are travelling to or through Iran are urged to follow the travel advice on the DFAT Smartraveller website. That advice? \u201cReconsider your need to travel\u201d. Part of the country is on the do-not-travel list. Pauline Hanson is giving a masterclass in \u2018we need answers to these questions that take this situation out into the stratosphere that I have just thought of, but I have no idea whether or not that is the actual case\u2019 on Chris Kenny\u2019s show. It\u2019s a wonderful technique: \u2018I have no idea if they murder puppies and deliver the carcasses to small children in the night, but I think those questions need to be answered\u2019. The Big Aussie BBQ is on in parliament today, raising awareness for prostate cancer. Scott Morrison will attend. Prepare for Morrison-with-BBQ-tongs photos. There will absolutely be a \u201chow good\u201d face. No word on whether or not angus is on the menu. Gladys Liu has released her statement: \u201cLast night in a TV interview I was not clear and I should have chosen my words better. As a new member of parliament I will be learning from this experience\u201d I\u2019m sure that will be the end of it* *Yes, that is sarcasm Melisssa McIntosh, another class of 2019 alumnus as the new Liberal MP for Lindsay, has announced she will be delivering a speech ahead of question time in the chamber, talking about September 11 and the Australian flag that was found in World Trade Centre 3. McIntosh talked about how not being in the September 11 attack changed her life during her first speech. At 23, I entered the corporate world. Like many young people \u2014 like many young women \u2014 I was rushing to get ahead and achieve it all before kids. I was also the girl from Penrith, wanting to be the best and to take all the opportunities. People from western Sydney are really committed; if you have to commute three hours a day or more for your job, you have to be. But then an experience changed things. I was given a wonderful opportunity to travel to New York for work. A couple of days out from my departure, the trip was cancelled. I was disappointed. I was going to be staying at the famous Twin Towers. I would have been in one of those towers on September 11. I will never forget that day, sitting in an almost empty office in Sydney, about 20 storeys up, overlooking Hyde Park, wondering what would have happened if I had made it to New York. Rushing for a career wasn\u2019t so important after that, so I put it on hold and I went travelling the world with Stuart and his sporting career. Terri Butler fronted up to doors this morning to have a chat about David Littleproud\u2019s admission that he is unsure if climate change is manmade. But she wouldn\u2019t say which way Labor would vote on the climate emergency proposal the crossbench is putting forward. Why? Because Labor doesn\u2019t know yet: Journalist: Will you be supporting the motion from the crossbench re this climate emergency? TB: Well, it\u2019s actually up to the government to decide whether there will be a declaration of a climate emergency, and frankly, I don\u2019t have any confidence that they even believe in climate change. They\u2019ve had their own minister out there saying that he\u2019s not sure whether manmade climate change exists, he doesn\u2019t know whether it\u2019s even real. How can we be confident that this government will take any action on climate change, or take any serious action whatsoever, when they\u2019ve got science-denying ministers in their own frontbench, which is threatening the prosperity of our country. Journalist: Will you be voting for the motion? TB: Well, as I say, it\u2019s a matter for the government whether there is a climate emergency declaration. The question is, what will the prime minister do? What will his ministers do? We\u2019ve got a senior frontbencher, someone who is the drought minister, the water minister, out saying he\u2019s not sure if manmade climate change is really a thing. I don\u2019t know whether we can be confident that the government will actually do anything at all. The latest independent health advice panel (the government-appointed panel for the medevac bill) has tabled its latest report. It has found that, in terms of ministerial refusal to transfer patients to the mainland for treatment, the panel agreed with the minister\u2019s decision in nine of the 15 cases. Which means the panel of health officials appointed by the government overruled the minister in just six cases, because they judged the need for treatment in the mainland to be critical. That\u2019s not exactly a \u201cflood\u201d of people. And as far as I know, our public hospitals have not fallen. Society stands. And some very ill people who are in our care are receiving the treatment doctors have judged them to need. Also in the report \u2013 the panel is planning a visit to the regional processing centres. And just a reminder that anyone transferred to Australia for treatment remains in detention and is escorted to appointments/remains under guard. They do not get free rein to run around the community. The medevac repeal bill is due to come back to parliament in November. Jacqui Lambie is the crucial vote. Linda Burney chatted to Sabra Lane this morning on ABC AM. She gave Labor\u2019s positions on the upcoming welfare legislation the government is putting forward. On drug testing: LB: Labor is not supporting that policy. This is the third time the government has dusted off this policy and I just heard on Radio National there is a group of experts meeting in Canberra today. They are saying this is punitive. It\u2019s not going to work. And the biggest issue is that there is just not enough treatment centres or treatment available for people that want to come off drug addiction. And that is where the government needs to focus. SL: The cashless welfare card. The government wants to roll this out nationally. 80 per cent of money is quarantined in that for rent and food. The government says it works. Has the Labor party got a position on that yet? LB: The Labor party does have a position. We\u2019ve had a position for some time on the cashless welfare card. And that is that if a community has proper consultation and proper consent, and the community wants the card, then Labor would not stand in the way. But we do not support a national rollout of this card. It goes to whether or not it\u2019s effective. And I have to say Sabra, just in closing, that the evaluations so far have been quite inadequate and there needs to be proper evaluation, and Labor has a very strong view and a very persistent view on this particular card. We are still waiting on the statement. Zed Seselja, who has obviously taken his shitstirrer tablet this morning, says he is unclear if Kim Carr is supporting the bill or not, because it has been \u201c19 minutes\u201d of talking the bill down. Carr is having none of it. He says the government is ignoring the big issues and using things like this bill as a distraction. He really, really, really doesn\u2019t like Labor\u2019s position on this one. Kim Carr, who spoke up during yesterday\u2019s caucus meeting about Labor\u2019s intention to vote for what has become known as the \u201cvegan terrorist\u201d bill, is forcibly listing his concerns about the bill in the Senate. He\u2019ll vote for it, because that is the caucus position, and to go against the caucus position in Labor is grounds for getting kicked out of the party. But he is not happy about it. At all. It being Wednesday, means it is National Press Club day. Mark Dreyfus will be delivering today\u2019s speech. It\u2019s on the need for a national integrity commission. Seems the seat of Chisholm comes with a side of \u201changing the MP out to dry\u201d. Julia Banks held the seat before Liu. We saw the home affairs minister briefly yesterday, during a failed lickspittle attempt (when you want to talk about how terrible the opposition is, you kinda have to add the \u201calternative approaches\u201d kicker to the question, which wasn\u2019t there yesterday) but Peter Dutton has kept relatively quiet, for him, this sitting week. We aren\u2019t hearing from him anywhere near as much as we usually do. Just making a note. Don\u2019t think the Biloela community have forgotten. The former Liberal party leader John Hewson says his party membership has lapsed but he remains motivated by liberal values which \u201cgot me into the parliament in the first place\u201d. Speaking to Annelise Nielsen on Sky, he says that he is part of the push for the parliament to declare a climate emergency because not enough is being done. \u201cRather than be a laggard in the climate debate, we should be a leader,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have tremendous sun and wind and other resources, there is a capacity to lead in the world in the response to climate change and we just squandered that opportunity over the last couple of decades.\u201d Asked if he still considers himself a Liberal, Hewson says: \u201cI have predominately liberal values, in terms of the significance of the individual and the significance of market forces and low levels of government and government regulation, but what I see in the Liberal party today, is if you were a true conservative and you did believe in small government and you did believe in low levels of regulation, you did believe in market forces, you would immediately put a price on carbon. \u201cThat is the obvious Liberal solution to this problem and fundamental to the transition that has got to be made. \u201cSo, I just think they\u2019ve lost their roots, quite frankly.\u201d AAP has written about the latest banking royal commission move from the government. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg released draft legislation on Wednesday for consultation to strengthen the Australian Securities and Investments Commission\u2019s enforcement and supervision powers. It includes strengthening Asic\u2019s licensing powers by increasing the standards required of an Australian Financial Services entity, both at the time of application and on an ongoing basis. It also extends the watchdog\u2019s powers to ban a person from performing functions in a financial services or credit business while harmonising Asic\u2019s search warrant powers to bring them into line with the search warrant powers of the Crimes Act. \u201cThe exposure draft legislation is further evidence of the government\u2019s commitment to strengthening financial regulators like Asic and restoring trust in the financial system as part of our plan to build a stronger economy,\u201d Frydenberg said in a statement. Consultations close on 9 October. Over in the portrait hall, the outgoing head of Asio, Duncan Lewis, has called for a public service college and referred to the apolitical public service as a \u201cprecious jewel\u201d. And the bells have tolled for the beginning of the parliamentary session. Duncan Lewis is doing his valedictory speech to the Institute of Public Administration Australia. That\u2019s in the portrait gallery, if anyone is interested. If Gerard Rennick\u2019s speech wasn\u2019t enough, I have just discovered that Phil Thompson, the LNP MP for Herbert (also class of 2019), has his bacon and egg roll with tomato sauce. On behalf of all of Queensland, I apologise for this travesty. Just back to the climate emergency motion (hello, good people of blogues), Labor hasn\u2019t made a decision yet about whether to back the Greens motion. If you aren\u2019t across the details of this story, read it here. The frontbencher Joel Fitzgibbon (who faced a backlash from constituents in the Hunter in the May election) said on Radio National this morning he was more supportive of outcomes than gestures. During the May election campaign, Bill Shorten adopted language about climate change referencing an emergency. He declared in a speech during the final week: \u201cWe will take [the climate change] emergency seriously, and we will not just leave it to other countries or to the next generation.\u201d But the shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, is in a holding pattern. Labor will consider any motions brought forward through our usual processes. The Morrison government needs to make up its mind about whether they think climate change is even real, let alone an emergency. Just yesterday we had the spectacle of the minister for water resources and emergency services say he doesn\u2019t know if human-induced climate change is real in spite of a clear consensus from all Australia\u2019s scientific agencies about the impacts of climate change on the frequency and severity of extreme weather events and drought. No wonder we\u2019ve seen no real climate policy from this government, and emissions that keep on rising. If you aren\u2019t across Butler\u2019s reference about David Littleproud and human-induced warming, read Paul Karp\u2019s story here. Penny Wong went by the doors this morning, because Labor has decided how it is going to tackle the Gladys Liu story. The Liberal MP has refused to explicitly criticise China after questions about her connections to Chinese Communist party propaganda organisations. Liu also would not say China\u2019s actions in the South China Sea are unlawful, despite an international tribunal finding otherwise. Wong says Scott Morrison needs to assure Australia that the Chisholm MP is \u201ca fit and proper person in the Australian parliament\u201d. She raised the government\u2019s response to Sam Dastyari\u2019s actions, with a \u201csamesies\u201d tone: He needs to come into the parliament, make a statement and assure the Australian parliament, and through them, the Australia people, that sheis a fit and proper person in the Australian parliament \u2026 I would make this point: I can recall the Liberal party making Sam Dastyari a test of Bill Shorten\u2019s leadership. Well, this is Scott Morrison\u2019s test. Two British-Australian women and another foreign national, also believed to be Australian, have been detained in Iran. The Times of London has reported that a blogger who was travelling through Asia with her Australian boyfriend, and an academic who studied at Cambridge University and has been working at a university in Australia, were seized separately. The two women are believed to be at the Evin prison in Tehran, where Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a 41-year-old British-Iranian national, has been incarcerated on spying charges since 2016. You can read more from that report from Michael McGowan and Kevin Rawlinson here. Marise Payne\u2019s office has been contacted. Zali Steggall is speaking to Laura Jayes on Sky about why she wants the parliament to declare a climate emergency. Essentially, she says, it boils down to a need to act. John Hewson, the former Liberal leader, is on board. The crossbench, led by Adam Bandt in this case, is pushing for this. It comes after David Littleproud said he didn\u2019t know whether climate change was human-made or not. Lisa Cox and Anne Davies have an update on the grasslands story involving Angus Taylor: Department of the environment officials were acutely sensitive about meeting Angus Taylor over critically endangered grasslands while his family\u2019s company was being investigated for alleged illegal land clearing in New South Wales, according to internal emails. The information is revealed in correspondence that had previously been partially redacted from documents obtained by Guardian Australia under freedom of information laws in June this year. It comes after Labor again pursued the energy and emissions reduction minister in question time on Tuesday and called on him to resign over the saga. You can read the rest of that report, here. Of course, it\u2019s not just Gerard Rennick who has people talking about the class of 2019. There is also Gladys Liu after her interview with Andrew Bolt on Sky News overnight, following up this ABC story. It opened with this: Bolt: Joining me is Liberal MP Gladys Liu. Gladys, thank you so much for your time. Can I just start, were you on the committee of two chapters of the China Overseas Guangdong Exchange Association, one in Guangdong from 2003 to 2015 and the other in Shandong? Liu: Well, good to be that with you, Andrew. I can tell you that I cannot recall, if as is reported that from 2003 to 2015, 12 years long, that if I can\u2019t recall, I can\u2019t be an active member of that council, can I? Bolt: How can you not recall a membership of 12 years? I mean, we have just shown your name listed there. I\u2019ve got another document I can show other you, of your name listed in the other association. That is two associations, associations lasting, well, 12 years, and you can\u2019t recall it? Liu: Well, I can tell you that I have never been a member of this council and, yeah, it can happen. They can put your name there without your knowledge. And didn\u2019t get much better. Liu would also not say whether or not she believed China\u2019s actions in the South China Sea were unlawful. Australia has condemned China\u2019s actions. Bolt: Can I just hear you say it, that you support the Australian government\u2019s position that the theft of the South China Sea by China is unlawful? Is it unlawful, yes or sure no? Liu: Well, as I said, I want to make sure that Australians interests were put first and foremost and if it\u2019s going to affect our trade or our air travelling, then that is something that I would not support. Bolt: Well, in fact, it does affect our trade, 60% of it goes through that sea. We have been warned by China to stay away. We are thinking of challenging that with our navy, and you are here not able to actually support the government\u2019s position that it was unlawful. Is there some problem with you agreeing that it was unlawful? It has been held so under international law. Why are you not going along with that? Liu: Well, I never said that I\u2019m not going along with it. What I\u2019m saying is I always put Australia\u2019s interests first. After all, I am a member of parliament for the Australian government and so of course I will put Australia\u2019s interests first and whatever \u2013 as I said in my maiden speech too, I will always want to have a good relationship between Australia and China and I will put Australia\u2019s interests first. Before revelations the former Labor senator Sam Dastyari had warned a donor he may be under surveillance by security agencies, the government had called for his sacking after reports he contradicted Labor \u2013 and the government\u2019s \u2013 position on the dispute. A recording eventually confirmed the report. Meanwhile, the Liberal senator Gerard Rennick, who appears to be a great fan of the settling \u201cfounding fathers\u201d and that can-do convict spirit, was everything his LNP colleagues had told me he would be in his first speech. Here\u2019s a taste: The greatest threat to our environment is not carbon dioxide but unsustainable immigration. As the son of a farmer, I was taught from a young age about carrying capacity and never to overstock your paddocks. Yet immigration is doing just that, causing major city congestion and overdevelopment on our city fringes. He is also very against regulations, and government intervention, except in the areas he would like to see regulation and government intervention, which includes, but is not limited to, what superannuation funds can spend their money on, what should be built, how universities are run, what foreign capital can be spent on, who can buy infrastructure, and the reserve bank. Oh, and a government bank, in line with Macquarie\u2019s holey dollar. After all, the convicts didn\u2019t have regulations. Except for all those regulations that sent them here in the first place, and the regulations that kept them in a prison colony, and the regulations that saw them (and of course, First Australians) forced into slavery and chain gangs to build colonial infrastructure. But other than that, it was just good ole fair-go spirit. Labor, which went to the election with a plan to recognise climate change and reduce emissions, has not been overly vocal in linking the Queensland and NSW fires to what is happening to the climate. While Sussan Ley copped some flak for saying this on ABC Melbourne radio late yesterday: Ley: \u201cI know that the climate is changing, and I know that the people I represent and rural Australians, see that every day. Now when there is an emergency of this sort, and people are worried about losing their homes, to have these high-level discussions about these issues, perhaps we leave them for another day and focus on helping people right here, right now. Q: You don\u2019t think the fires have anything to do with climate change? Ley: Look, my honest answer to that is I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what caused this particular fire on this particular day ... Q: I am not asking about an individual fire \u2013 the science is pretty clear though isn\u2019t it, climate change leads to more fires and more intense fires. Ley: We have always lived on a continent which has been ravaged by fires, I am not going to become an expert on what is causing the fires. It\u2019s not that far from the line some in Labor are taking: \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about it now.\u201d Ain\u2019t politics grand? Well, there is never a dull moment in this place. Less than 24 hours after the water minister, David Littleproud, admitted to Guardian Australia that he was unsure whether climate change was human-made or not, he went into further detail with on Sky News: David Speers: You say the climate is changing and that is certainly true - the question is, is this manmade climate change. David Littleproud: I have no idea, but does it really matter? DS: Sorry, you have no idea whether ... DL: I am not a scientist, I haven\u2019t made an opinion one way or the other, but I don\u2019t think it really matters. DS: Sorry, I just want to be really clear on this \u2013 you are not sure whether man-made climate change is real. DL: I am going to be honest with you \u2013 I don\u2019t have an opinion, but I don\u2019t think it really matters. I think these extremes from both sides have taken away the maturity of debate we should have about keeping, simply, a clean environment and making sure we give our people the tools they [need to address it]. The crossbench and former Liberal leader John Hewson have banded together to call on the parliament to declare a climate emergency. The declaration motion to be released today calls on the House to declare an environment and climate emergency and to take urgent action consistent with internationally accepted science. The motion will be moved by Greens MP for Melbourne Adam Bandt, seconded by the independent Member for Warringah Zali Steggall OAM, and supported by the independent Member for Indi, Helen Haines, Centre Alliance Member for Mayo, Rebekha Sharkie and the independent Member for Clark, Andrew Wilkie. It has been building for a while. Plus, the Queensland rainforest is on fire. In early September. We\u2019ll bring you that, plus everything else that happens today, including the Gladys Liu trainwreck interview with Andrew Bolt overnight. Plus, people are still digesting Gerard Rennick\u2019s first speech to the Senate. I know I am. You\u2019ve got the whole team: Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Paul Karp and Sarah Martin on board, plus everyone else who keeps the blog \u2013 and me \u2013 ticking over. I am on coffee number three and have exactly 211 minutes\u2019 sleep, so I hope you are as excited to tackle hump day as me. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.",

      "body": "<p>Laura Purcell\u2019s new novel is billed as a \u201cDu Maurier-esque chiller\u201d, which may be putting it mildly. We meet Hester Why aboard a mail coach as it lurches through the Cornish night. From Falmouth, she proceeds by pony and trap to her destination, announced in the time-honoured manner by a grizzled driver. \u201cWe be on Morvoren land now,\u201d he croaks.</p> <p>We be veering towards outright staginess, too, it must be said. The effect isn\u2019t just Du Maurier-esque; it\u2019s Du Maurier-tastic. Which isn\u2019t a bad thing, necessarily. She could ham it up with the best of them \u2013 indeed, she was the best of them \u2013 and sometimes readers like to know exactly what they are getting. It\u2019s an approach that has certainly worked for Purcell so far: she won the WHSmith Thumping Good Read award in 2017 for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/nov/24/crime-fiction-roundup-review\" title=\"\"><em>The Silent Companions</em></a> and has since been widely celebrated as a purveyor of well-wrought tales shaded with dark intrigue.</p> <p>The necessary ingredients are here in abundance. Hester is a woman with a secret. Several secrets, in fact. Covering up both a gin habit and a weakness for pilfered laudanum, she is travelling under an assumed name (though Hester Why seems a puzzling choice, since everyone who hears it will surely repeat it at least once in confusion). Formerly Esther Stevens, she has fled her last position in distinctly murky circumstances. The daughter of a midwife, she has a store of medical knowledge and an affinity for the sick, but her former employers have been peculiarly prone to misadventure.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Purcell stores up some satisfying and suitably macabre final revelations</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At Morvoren House, Hester nurses the enfeebled Miss Pinecroft, who by day is confined to a frigid parlour arrayed with bone china and at night to a locked bedchamber. Conflicting explanations are given for these arrangements, none of them especially reassuring. The other servants are a dour and superstitious bunch, attributing all manner of misdeeds to malevolent fairy folk. Hester is far from convinced, yet these strange tales seem intertwined with the melancholy history of the Pinecroft family. There are, she is told, \u201cstrange things on the moors\u201d.</p> <p>Your enjoyment of all this will depend on your tolerance for such melodramatic flourishes, and for Cornish dialect that at times is laid on thickly enough to fill a pasty.

      "bodyText": "Laura Purcell\u2019s new novel is billed as a \u201cDu Maurier-esque chiller\u201d, which may be putting it mildly. We meet Hester Why aboard a mail coach as it lurches through the Cornish night. From Falmouth, she proceeds by pony and trap to her destination, announced in the time-honoured manner by a grizzled driver. \u201cWe be on Morvoren land now,\u201d he croaks. We be veering towards outright staginess, too, it must be said. The effect isn\u2019t just Du Maurier-esque; it\u2019s Du Maurier-tastic. Which isn\u2019t a bad thing, necessarily. She could ham it up with the best of them \u2013 indeed, she was the best of them \u2013 and sometimes readers like to know exactly what they are getting. It\u2019s an approach that has certainly worked for Purcell so far: she won the WHSmith Thumping Good Read award in 2017 for The Silent Companions and has since been widely celebrated as a purveyor of well-wrought tales shaded with dark intrigue. The necessary ingredients are here in abundance. Hester is a woman with a secret. Several secrets, in fact. Covering up both a gin habit and a weakness for pilfered laudanum, she is travelling under an assumed name (though Hester Why seems a puzzling choice, since everyone who hears it will surely repeat it at least once in confusion). Formerly Esther Stevens, she has fled her last position in distinctly murky circumstances. The daughter of a midwife, she has a store of medical knowledge and an affinity for the sick, but her former employers have been peculiarly prone to misadventure. At Morvoren House, Hester nurses the enfeebled Miss Pinecroft, who by day is confined to a frigid parlour arrayed with bone china and at night to a locked bedchamber. Conflicting explanations are given for these arrangements, none of them especially reassuring. The other servants are a dour and superstitious bunch, attributing all manner of misdeeds to malevolent fairy folk. Hester is far from convinced, yet these strange tales seem intertwined with the melancholy history of the Pinecroft family. There are, she is told, \u201cstrange things on the moors\u201d. Your enjoyment of all this will depend on your tolerance for such melodramatic flourishes, and for Cornish dialect that at times is laid on thickly enough to fill a pasty. If you can get past these, then there\u2019s plenty here to entertain you. Purcell has a sure storytelling touch, a command of atmosphere and a keen eye for the telling details of social history. Oh, and she stores up some satisfying and suitably macabre final revelations. If nothing else, you\u2019ll never look at a service of fine bone china in quite the same way. \u2022 Paraic O\u2019Donnell\u2019s The House on Vesper Sands is published by W&amp;N.

Lee Meng-chu was being investigated after he \u201callegedly engaged in illegal activities that endanger state security\u201d, said a spokesman for mainland China\u2019s Taiwan Affairs Office, without elaborating. Friends and family feared Lee \u2013 a volunteer activity organiser in a small fishing community in southern Taiwan \u2013 had been detained in China after they were unable to contact him for weeks. Chen Yalin, a Taiwanese mayor, told Taiwan\u2019s government-run Central News Agency earlier that Lee sent him a photo showing paramilitary troops gathering, and that he was unable to contact Lee after that. Chen added that he was in touch with Lee on 20 August, when Lee said he was at the Hong Kong side of the border with China and wanted to cross over to Shenzhen. \u201cThe People\u2019s Liberation Army were gathering at the border, the situation seemed tense,\u201d Chen quoted Lee as saying. Chen said Lee \u2013 from the township of Fangliao \u2013 was expected to fly from Hong Kong to Indonesia to meet him in Jakarta for a conference in late August but had failed to arrive. The news of Lee\u2019s detention came as Hong Kong was mired in its worst political crisis for decades, with anti-government protests showing no sign of abating after three months. Photos of drills conducted in the Chinese border town of Shenzhen have fuelled speculation that China might mobilise its military to crack down on protests in Hong Kong. People held by China on state security charges are often detained for months at an unknown location and are denied visits from lawyers and families. In March 2017, Taiwanese rights activist Lee Ming-che disappeared on a trip to China and emerged in September at a court hearing in the southern city of Changsha. He was later sentenced to five years in prison for the \u201csubversion of state power\u201d for holding online political lectures and helping the families of jailed dissidents.",

The two officials are said to have been at loggerheads for months to the extent that in recent days they were not speaking other than at official engagements.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere were definitely places that Ambassador Bolton and I had different views about how we should proceed,\u201d Pompeo said yesterday. Asked if he had been taken unawares by the development, the secretary of state smiled and said: \u201cI\u2019m never surprised.\u201d</p> \n<p>Bolton also appears to have alienated Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, for his refusal to promote presidential policies he did not agree with.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt was in Bolton\u2019s nature to run an imperial NSC [national security council] but he stepped on the toes of too many people,\u201d said Mark Groombridge, who worked for Bolton for a decade. \u201cHe got into the crosshairs of Pompeo and Mulvaney, who saw Bolton as a liability for the 2020 election. War on every front was not what Trump ran on.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump was unusually candid about the rift within his own inner team. In the tweets he posted on Tuesday announcing Bolton\u2019s departure <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1171452880055746560\">he wrote</a>: \u201cI informed John Bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the White House. I disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions, as did others in the Administration, and therefore I asked John for his resignation, which was given to me this morning.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump said he would announce his pick for his fourth national security adviser next week, and early speculation on candidates pointed to the ambassador to Germany, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/04/new-us-ambassador-to-germany-under-fire-for-rightwing-support\">Richard Grenell</a>, Iran envoy Brian Hook and Robert Blair, an aide to Mulvaney.</p> \n<p>An adviser to Iran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani, said Bolton\u2019s departure underlined the failure of Washington\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure strategy\u201d against Iran.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe marginalisation and subsequent elimination of Bolton is not an accident but a decisive sign of the failure of the US maximum pressure strategy in the face of the constructive resistance of Iran,\u201d Hesameddin Ashena tweeted.</p> \n<p>Bolton\u2019s departure could open the way to fresh diplomacy with Iran. Trump has repeatedly said he is prepared to meet Rouhani, at the urging of France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron.</p> \n<p>Asked on Tuesday if he could foresee such a meeting at the UN general assembly later this month, Pompeo replied: \u201cSure.\u201d</p> \n<p>Commentators interpreted the news as further evidence of chaos and confusion within Trump\u2019s White House, but there were also loud sighs of relief from those who were delighted to see such a hawkish influence excised from the heart of government.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/10/john-bolton-firing-trump-analysis-us-foreign-policy\">Trump couldn't build a foreign policy legacy with Bolton the breaker</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Elizabeth Warren, a leading contender for the Democratic presidential nomination, agreed, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1171477921107591169\">saying</a>: \u201cThe American people are better off with John Bolton out of the White House.\u201d</p> \n<p>Her rival, Bernie Sanders <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/1171471233705099264\">tweeted</a>: \u201cA symptom of the problem is gone. The root cause of authoritarianism remains.\u201d</p> \n<p>The National Iranian American Council, the largest body of US-Iranians, heralded the decision as the best of Trump\u2019s presidency, saying in a statement: \u201cThis single move dramatically reduces the chances of a new, catastrophic war in the Middle East.\u201d</p> \n<p>In contrast, the Republican senator Lindsey Graham <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1171479204942057473\">praised Bolton</a> on Twitter for \u201calways pursuing an agenda that not only helps the President but makes America safe\u201d.</p> \n<p>Trump appointed Bolton in March 2018, having been impressed by the former US ambassador to the UN\u2019s performances as a commentator on Fox News, where he advocated a first strike on North Korea and pushed for regime change in Tehran.</p> \n<p>The tension between such a militaristic stance and Trump\u2019s hesitancy about being drawn into another major conflict broke into public view this summer as Bolton was increasingly pushed into the shadows. The division was plain to see when Trump made a <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2019/06/30/trump_after_meeting_with_kim_jong_un_at_dmz_very_legendary_historic_day.html\">surprise visit</a> in June to meet Kim, without his adviser.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"63d68d6d-3377-48ed-99ff-f614073fc0f2\" data-atom-type=\"profile\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Profile\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In March 2018 John Bolton, a longtime foreign policy hawk, was named as Trump\u2019s third national security adviser in just 14 months. Over a three-decade career in foreign policy, he has advocated frequent use of military force and disdained diplomacy and international institutions.</p>\n    <p>Before joining the Trump administration, he was best known for a brief stint as president George W Bush\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations \u2013 a body he openly sneered at. His role came to an end because the Senate would not confirm him.</p>\n    <p>Bolton has called for bombing both North Korea and Iran. Less than a month before his appointment by Trump, he penned a Wall Street Journal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-legal-case-for-striking-north-korea-first-1519862374\">op-ed</a> making \u201cthe legal case for striking North Korea first\".</p>\n    <p>He seems to have played a key role in the collapse of the second Trump summit with Kim Jong-un in February, when he appeared to have drafted a maximalist list of demands for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/07/trump-kim-jong-un-summit-bolton-launch-site-activity\">all-or-nothing disarmament</a> that was presented to the North Korean dictator in Hanoi. A year of diplomacy ground to a halt with Kim, who had been expecting a more gradualist approach</p>\n    <p>Bolton was a harsh critic of the Iran nuclear deal, which Trump pulled out of, and went further, advocating military force against the country. A bombing campaign was the only way to stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, he wrote in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/26/opinion/to-stop-irans-bomb-bomb-iran.html\">another op-ed</a>.</p>\n    <p>Bolton has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/06/us-deploys-aircraft-carrier-and-bombers-after-troubling-indications-from-iran\">seized the initiative</a> in the fast-moving escalation of tensions with Tehran during 2019, spinning military deployments in the Gulf that were already in the pipeline as confrontational steps against Tehran, and reportedly irritating some in the Pentagon and intelligence agencies by putting a sensationalist spin on intelligence about Iranian military movements.</p>\n    <p>In the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/03/venezuela-protests-news-latest-maduro-uprising-that-fizzled-\">standoff in Venezuela</a>, Bolton was again centre stage, making himself the lead US voice for a failed effort at regime change in Venezuela in late April, producing a personal video appeal calling \u2013 in vain \u2013 on Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s top aides to defect. Behind the scenes he has urged a reluctant US Southern Command to come up with ever more aggressive solutions to Maduro\u2019s hold on power.</p>\n    <p>In the past he has also opposed the International Criminal Court in the Hague. As undersecretary of state under George W Bush, he <a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/what-does-john-boltons-appointment-mean-icc-investigation-afghanistan\">travelled</a> around the world negotiating two-way agreements in which countries pledged not to send US officials to the court. He also forcefully opposed the UN security council referring suspected genocide in the Darfur region of Sudan to the court, though the United States ultimately sat out that vote and the referral went forward.</p>\n    <p>Bolton grew up in a working-class Republican family in Baltimore, and his first political experience was as a volunteer in the doomed 1964 campaign of Barry Goldwater, a staunch conservative from Arizona. He attended Yale University. Unlike many of his fellow students, he fiercely supported the war effort in Vietnam, but not to the point of taking part himself. He avoided the draft by joining the Maryland national guard.<br></p>\n    <p>&nbsp;Bolton held senior positions in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and the elder George Bush, and wrote a book summing up his views: Surrender Is Not An Option.</p>\n    <p>He is derided by critics as a warmonger, but <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/08/us/politics/john-bolton-trump.html\">defines</a> his own philosophy as \u201cAmericanist\u201d \u2013 a close cousin to Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d slogan \u2013 and is no fan of traditional carrot and stick diplomacy. \u201cI don\u2019t do carrots,\u201d he has said.</p>\n    <p>Trump announced on 10 September 2019 that he had fired Bolton, tweeting that \"I disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions, as did others in the Administration\".</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In June Trump came close to ordering airstrikes on Iran in response to the shooting down of a US surveillance drone but stood the mission down at the eleventh hour. That was a blow to Bolton, who had been the keenest advocate of an airstrike.</p> \n<p>Over the months Trump began goading Bolton over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/17/john-bolton-iran-north-korea-venezuela-trump\">his hawkish position</a> in front of other officials and even visiting heads of state. According to <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/trump-john-bolton-doctrine-iran-venezuela-war-427ca897-aaa1-4e10-a7c9-2a67c1d20354.html\">Axios</a>, he once said in the Oval Office: \u201cJohn has never seen a war he doesn\u2019t like.\u201d</p> \n<p>But the trigger to Tuesday\u2019s changing of the guard appears to have been Afghanistan. Bolton was openly unconvinced by efforts by Trump and Pompeo to do a deal with the Taliban as part of the plan to withdraw US troops from the country.</p> \n<p>Trump had been prepared to go as far as to invite Taliban leaders to Camp David just ahead of the 18th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington. The talks were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/08/donald-trump-afghanistan-taliban-talks-camp-david\">cancelled</a> at the last minute \u2013 but by then the gulf between the president and his aide had become unbridgeable.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has fired his national security adviser, John Bolton, in a pair of tweets in which he laid bare searing internal divisions within his inner circle, saying he had \u201cdisagreed strongly\u201d with his top aide. The departure of such a resolute hawk raises the possibility that Trump\u2019s foreign policy could now make a dovish turn in the run up to next year\u2019s elections, in particular with respect to Iran. The president\u2019s firing of his third national security adviser in as many years appears to have caught even the White House by surprise. The explosive tweets were posted barely an hour after it was announced that Bolton would be appearing at a press conference alongside the secretaries of state and treasury. Bolton himself added to the confusion, commenting minutes after his public dismissal that he had offered to resign on Monday night but that Trump had replied: \u201cLet\u2019s talk about it tomorrow.\u201d Bolton continued to press his case that he had resigned rather than being fired. He sent out a battery of texts including to Fox News presenters on air as well as the Washington Post, protesting: \u201cI resigned, having offered to do so last night.\u201d Bolton\u2019s resignation letter was terse in the extreme. \u201cI hereby resign, effective immediately, as Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs. Thank you for affording me this opportunity to serve our country,\u201d the two-line note said. The sacking-cum-resignation of the lavishly mustachioed Bolton, an ultra-hawk on foreign policy who under George Bush was a key architect of the invasion of Iraq in 2003, brings to a head mounting tensions within Trump\u2019s top team of national security and foreign policy strategists. His removal had been a long time coming, with Trump making little effort to disguise his dissatisfaction over many months. According to the New York Times, Bolton had refused to appear on television talk shows on 25 August after the G7 summit in Biarritz so he did not have defend the president\u2019s views on Russia The two men agreed on some issues, like scrapping multilateral agreements such as the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran and tearing up the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia. But Trump\u2019s maverick approach to dealing with tough men and adversaries, in which he has emphasized a willingness to deal directly with America\u2019s traditional enemies, such as Vladimir Putin in Russia, Kim Jong-un in North Korea \u2013 and most recently the Taliban in Afghanistan \u2013 was increasingly at odds with Bolton\u2019s hardline belief that US military might is right. Bolton was also reported to have a testy relationship with the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo. The two officials are said to have been at loggerheads for months to the extent that in recent days they were not speaking other than at official engagements. \u201cThere were definitely places that Ambassador Bolton and I had different views about how we should proceed,\u201d Pompeo said yesterday. Asked if he had been taken unawares by the development, the secretary of state smiled and said: \u201cI\u2019m never surprised.\u201d Bolton also appears to have alienated Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, for his refusal to promote presidential policies he did not agree with. \u201cIt was in Bolton\u2019s nature to run an imperial NSC [national security council] but he stepped on the toes of too many people,\u201d said Mark Groombridge, who worked for Bolton for a decade. \u201cHe got into the crosshairs of Pompeo and Mulvaney, who saw Bolton as a liability for the 2020 election. War on every front was not what Trump ran on.\u201d Trump was unusually candid about the rift within his own inner team. In the tweets he posted on Tuesday announcing Bolton\u2019s departure he wrote: \u201cI informed John Bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the White House. I disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions, as did others in the Administration, and therefore I asked John for his resignation, which was given to me this morning.\u201d Trump said he would announce his pick for his fourth national security adviser next week, and early speculation on candidates pointed to the ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, Iran envoy Brian Hook and Robert Blair, an aide to Mulvaney. An adviser to Iran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani, said Bolton\u2019s departure underlined the failure of Washington\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure strategy\u201d against Iran. \u201cThe marginalisation and subsequent elimination of Bolton is not an accident but a decisive sign of the failure of the US maximum pressure strategy in the face of the constructive resistance of Iran,\u201d Hesameddin Ashena tweeted. Bolton\u2019s departure could open the way to fresh diplomacy with Iran. Trump has repeatedly said he is prepared to meet Rouhani, at the urging of France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron. Asked on Tuesday if he could foresee such a meeting at the UN general assembly later this month, Pompeo replied: \u201cSure.\u201d Commentators interpreted the news as further evidence of chaos and confusion within Trump\u2019s White House, but there were also loud sighs of relief from those who were delighted to see such a hawkish influence excised from the heart of government. Elizabeth Warren, a leading contender for the Democratic presidential nomination, agreed, saying: \u201cThe American people are better off with John Bolton out of the White House.\u201d Her rival, Bernie Sanders tweeted: \u201cA symptom of the problem is gone. The root cause of authoritarianism remains.\u201d The National Iranian American Council, the largest body of US-Iranians, heralded the decision as the best of Trump\u2019s presidency, saying in a statement: \u201cThis single move dramatically reduces the chances of a new, catastrophic war in the Middle East.\u201d In contrast, the Republican senator Lindsey Graham praised Bolton on Twitter for \u201calways pursuing an agenda that not only helps the President but makes America safe\u201d. Trump appointed Bolton in March 2018, having been impressed by the former US ambassador to the UN\u2019s performances as a commentator on Fox News, where he advocated a first strike on North Korea and pushed for regime change in Tehran. The tension between such a militaristic stance and Trump\u2019s hesitancy about being drawn into another major conflict broke into public view this summer as Bolton was increasingly pushed into the shadows. The division was plain to see when Trump made a surprise visit in June to meet Kim, without his adviser. In June Trump came close to ordering airstrikes on Iran in response to the shooting down of a US surveillance drone but stood the mission down at the eleventh hour. That was a blow to Bolton, who had been the keenest advocate of an airstrike. Over the months Trump began goading Bolton over his hawkish position in front of other officials and even visiting heads of state. According to Axios, he once said in the Oval Office: \u201cJohn has never seen a war he doesn\u2019t like.\u201d But the trigger to Tuesday\u2019s changing of the guard appears to have been Afghanistan. Bolton was openly unconvinced by efforts by Trump and Pompeo to do a deal with the Taliban as part of the plan to withdraw US troops from the country. Trump had been prepared to go as far as to invite Taliban leaders to Camp David just ahead of the 18th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington. The talks were cancelled at the last minute \u2013 but by then the gulf between the president and his aide had become unbridgeable.",

The Jagat Seths offered the company more than \u00a34m (about a hundred times that in current terms, reckons Dalrymple) to unseat Siraj ud-Daula and install a compliant collaborator in his stead.

Plassey was in truth a \u201cpalace coup\u201d, executed by a greedy opportunist, won by bribery and betrayal.</p> <p>It took six months in those days for news to travel from Calcutta to London, and even when it arrived, few really understood what was going on in Bengal. \u201cWas it true,\u201d asked one company director, that \u201cSir Roger Daulat\u201d was a baronet?

      "bodyText": "Liz Truss has been made women and equalities minister and Zac Goldsmith promoted to attending cabinet as Boris Johnson conducted a mini-reshuffle on the first day of parliament\u2019s shutdown. Truss was given the portfolio on Tuesday following Amber Rudd\u2019s resignation on Saturday from that role as well as from her seat in cabinet as work and pensions secretary along with the Conservative whip in protest at the direction of Johnson\u2019s Brexit policy. The new equalities minister is a rightwinger and free marketer who was an early backer of Johnson and entered his cabinet as international trade secretary, a role she will continue to hold. Truss voted for same-sex marriage but abstained on a vote to extend those rights to Northern Ireland. Her appointment is not likely to be welcomed by transgender rights campaigners as she backed Mumsnet in a bitter row about whether criticism of transgender activism on the platform should be allowed as part of free speech. As equalities minister, Truss will be responsible for reforms to the Gender Recognition Act begun by Theresa May, which were aimed at allowing transgender people to self-certify their gender without the need for medical assessment. Goldsmith, an environment and development minister, will attend cabinet as a replacement to the prime minister\u2019s brother, Jo Johnson, who resigned citing the pressures of the Brexit situation on his family. His promotion is controversial given his campaign to be Conservative mayor against Labour\u2019s Sadiq Khan which was accused of being racist and Islamophobic by trying to paint him as having links with terrorists and extremists. Other moves include Chris Skidmore becoming a science minister at the departments of education and business and Edward Argar becoming a minister of state at the Department of Health and Social Care.

      "bodyText": "Raised cameraphones have become a ubiquitous part of cultural events over the last decade, but for her Savage x Fenty lingerie show, one of the most hyped of this fashion season, Rihanna made sure that couldn\u2019t be the case. Guests arriving at the Barclays Arena in Brooklyn on Tuesday night were required to deposit devices into sealed pouches at the door \u2013 in large part to make sure the show remains under wraps until 20 September, when it will be exclusively streamed by Amazon Prime across 200 countries and territories, giving it a reach well beyond that of a traditional catwalk. The show opened with Rihanna and a small group of women standing stock-still on top of podiums before breaking into dance. There were performances by Halsey, A$AP Ferg and DJ Khaled, as well as appearances from models including Alek Wek, Cara Delevingne, Joan Smalls, Laverne Cox and the Hadid sisters. But it was the diverse troupe of women in their underwear \u2013 made for different shapes, sizes and skin tones \u2013 who took centre stage, with their bodies doing the talking. They danced and stomped across the set; routines saw them melt, like a scene from Patrick Suskind\u2019s novel Perfume, into a mass of bodies, or stand in the individual segments of a set made to mimic the architecture of the Colosseum \u2013 sometimes one would light up and one woman would dance her turn, at other times they would move as one. Camera operators scrambled to capture the action, with performers occasionally working the camera ahead of the room \u2013 a reminder that first and foremost this was made for the screen. But the live audience, which included Anna Wintour, Orange is the New Black star Dascha Polanco, as well as an excited Halima Aden, didn\u2019t seem to mind. In a press release, Rihanna explained the thinking behind the line, with bras available from 32A to 42H and sleepwear from XS to 3X: \u201cWe want to make people look good and feel good. We want you to feel sexy and have fun doing it.\u201d The underwear on show spoke to the traditional tropes of lingerie \u2013 often sheer, sometimes skimpy. But in other ways, the line is designed not to fit the usual mould, with much of the build-up around the show focusing on what it is not. Rihanna herself has positioned her underwear extravaganza as stepping into the vacuum being left behind by the Victoria\u2019s Secret show. Usually a big event in the fashion calendar, this year it is absent as the brand battles with its associations with influential financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, as well as ongoing but increasingly loud criticisms about its archaic take on women\u2019s underwear. Where Victoria\u2019s Secret, which had its spot on network TV cancelled after last year, has historically designed lingerie with the male gaze in mind, Rihanna launched her line in 2018 with the words: \u201cWomen should be wearing lingerie for their damn selves\u201d. Comfort is queen in the current underwear market, and athleisure-styles have been on the rise \u2013 skimpy sets that are all about \u201csexiness\u201d and nothing about support are falling out of favour. As many brands will attest, empowerment sells. The Savage x Fenty underwear is already proving popular. A few days ago superstar Lizzo, who was recently described as synonymous with pop culture in 2019, posed in one of its strapless bras. The first year of sales were strong, leading, recently, to the announcement that Rihanna had secured an additional $50m in venture. The line, which is being sold through Amazon Fashion, remains separate from the rest of Rihanna\u2019s fashion offerings, which fall under the umbrella of the luxury conglomerate LMVH, speaking to the clout she has in the industry.",

Another: \u201cBuy the plane ticket, quit the job, plan the trip, wander into the unknown, open your heart, take the leap.\u201d These reminders to \u201clive fully\u201d are omnipresent on social media platforms. We are constantly told how to live well, happily, adventurously or spontaneously. An army of experts are instructing us to wash our faces, to be a badass, and to say yes. This #inspiration strategy works because humans are wired to want significance and meaning. But what does \u201cliving fully\u201d really mean in the age of Instagram, when anyone can wear matching yoga pants as they stand, arms outstretched and back to the camera, soaking in whatever scenic background they\u2019ve found that day? Madi Richardson, 23, explains that if she\u2019d been asked what \u201cliving fully\u201d meant a few years ago, she would have said traveling. Right after high school, Richardson was following a plethora of people her age on Instagram, including some with significant followings. \u201cThe photos I saw of them were on vacations,\u201d she explains. \u201cLiving, I guess, what seemed like everything but worry or negative emotions.\u201d With every scroll, Richardson saw glorious summers packed full with local music festivals and scenic hikes, usually with inspirational quotes peppered in between.

Earlier this year the UN told the UK to renounce its claim on the islands and allow the original inhabitants, who were expelled to make way for the base, to return. The Foreign Office organised the unannounced trip for Labour\u2019s Catherine West and the Conservatives Andrew Rosindell and Daniel Kawczynski at short notice in late August days ahead of the current Indian Ocean tour by Pope Francis in which he offered strong support to the forcibly exiled islanders. On Tuesday the pontiff urged Britain to comply with a UN resolution and return the islands to Mauritius, saying: \u201cYou must obey international institutions.

Since then, the tide of pent-up frustration and calls for accountability have exposed and stalled the careers of prominent men such as Matt Lauer, Charlie Rose and Les Moonves, to name a few. (Weinstein, whose criminal trial for rape and predatory sexual assault <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/26/harvey-weinstein-new--indictment-annabella-sciorra\">has been delayed until January 2020</a>, has denied all allegations of non-consensual sex and pleaded not guilty.)</p> <p>The final showdown with Weinstein is just one of several revelations in She Said that portend a much deeper story than the one which seized headlines two years ago.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"887c86c5a4d10fce455c0cc39431c1d13efb7c3f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/887c86c5a4d10fce455c0cc39431c1d13efb7c3f/0_186_5586_3352/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harvey Weinstein arrives to court with his lawyer for arraignment over a new indictment for sexual assault on 26 August 2019 in New York City.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harvey Weinstein arrives to court with his lawyer for arraignment over a new indictment for sexual assault on 26 August 2019 in New York City.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Spencer Platt/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe pretty quickly realized that our first Weinstein articles were actually just the beginning,\u201d Twohey told the Guardian in an interview. \u201cWith this book, we were able to piece together so many more pieces of the puzzle.\u201d</p> <p>She Said stitches together remarkable elements previously unknown to the public, including: a long-sought interview with Bob Weinstein, the mogul\u2019s brother and lifelong business partner, in which he claims he disastrously mischaracterized and enabled his brother\u2019s actions as extramarital affairs born of sex addiction. It details the previously unrevealed story of Irwin Reiter, Weinstein\u2019s corporate accountant for over 30 years, who served as the investigation\u2019s \u201cdeep throat\u201d by providing crucial company documents in the final stages. And it describes how the famed attorney Gloria Allred cultivated a public reputation as a feminist crusader while she and her firm privately negotiated and buried sexual harassment settlements for victims \u2013 including of Weinstein and the Olympic gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar \u2013 from which they took a 30% to 40% cut. There\u2019s also a damning memo from Allred\u2019s similarly notorious daughter, Lisa Bloom, who was paid $895 an hour by Weinstein for counsel on \u201cpositive reputation management\u201d. (Bloom later told the reporters that her work for Weinstein was a \u201ccolossal mistake\u201d.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We pretty quickly realized that our first Weinstein articles were actually just the beginning</p> <footer> <cite>Megan Twohey</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Supporting these bombshells are a mountain of smaller, quieter yet still powerful actions \u2013 Kantor fielding nervous texts from Gwyneth Paltrow as she deliberated going on the record (which she ultimately did in the second article, published on 10 October), or crafting the perfectly calibrated email to coax the actor Rose McGowan into a phone call. There\u2019s Twohey, knocking on the door of a woman who mysteriously left Weinstein\u2019s company in 1990, skillfully volleying small talk into an interview pitch. And there\u2019s an email from Laura Madden, one of the first women to go on the record against Weinstein, recounting how a conversation with her teenage daughters anchored her decision to speak.</p> <p>More than anything, She Said depicts the incremental work of pulling at long-neglected threads as well as the institutional heft and individual bravery required to hold powerful abuses to account.</p> <p>But She Said goes much deeper than a compelling play-by-play of nailing the first Weinstein story. The immediate aftermath of publication, when the dam broke on story after story of sexual indignity, workplace harassment, or assault, \u201conly made us feel greater responsibility\u201d, Kantor told the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cWe said to ourselves: we\u2019ve got to try to finally answer some of these lingering questions from the Weinstein story. How can a company become so complicit in predation? What are the systems that enable this kind of abuse? In the face of a \u201cstaggering\u201d wave of personal and institutional responses, said Twohey, \u201cWe just decided that the most important thing we could do was keep reporting.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3892511bb465c3fc6eb91f331daa900db7d3eee9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3892511bb465c3fc6eb91f331daa900db7d3eee9/0_61_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The producers of the Miramax film Shakespeare in Love, including Harvey Weinstein and Gwyneth Paltrow, who was later an early, crucial source in Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor\u2019s reporting.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Producers of the film Shakespeare in Love, including Harvey Weinstein, and Gwyneth Paltrow, who was later an early, crucial source in Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor\u2019s reporting.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Blake/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That reporting unmasked a decades-long culture of complicity at the Weinstein Company and its forerunner, Miramax, which prized protection from liability over protection of women, and a shadowy cottage industry of out-of-court settlements for victims of harassment and assault sealed with punishing non-disclosure agreements.</p> <p>One Weinstein accuser, Zelda Perkins, revealed to Kantor and Twohey an agreement which prohibited her from discussing her employment at Miramax with anyone, including talking to a therapist without a confidentiality agreement, or even obtaining a full copy of the contract.</p> <p>But a brave few did speak out and the book reveals their personal journeys to going public for the first time: Laura Madden, the first woman to speak out against Weinstein on-record in an interview, who participated days before a mastectomy and reconstructive surgery for breast cancer. Rowena Chiu, who didn\u2019t tell her family about her 1998 settlement with Weinstein until after Kantor arrived at her Silicon Valley home, now on the record for the first time. And Perkins, formerly of the Miramax London office, who \u201calways had a larger vision of what this was about\u201d, said Kantor. \u201cShe said even as early as that, this isn\u2019t about getting Harvey; this is about an entire system that silences women.\u201d</p> <p>In the preface, Kantor and Twohey explicitly pose the question: did the cultural change go too far? Or not far enough?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You can\u2019t fix a problem you can\u2019t see.

The past two years have revealed \u201cthree questions about #MeToo that remain totally unresolved\u201d, said Kantor \u2013 what behaviors are under scrutiny? What tools can evaluate truth? And what are the appropriate measures for accountability and punishment?</p> <p>Nearly a year ago, Kantor and Twohey watched as a previously unknown psychology professor from Palo Alto, California, testified before the Senate judiciary committee about her allegation of sexual assault, in high school, by the then supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. The final two chapters of She Said follow the personal journey of Dr Christine Blasey Ford as she deliberated over going public with her story \u2013 a journey more fraught than previously revealed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--showcase\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Fdaf70c884450e407aa8dbb9a836c74a28259113a%3Fcrop%3D0_191_3000_1800&amp;left-caption=Demonstrators%20protest%20against%20the%20confirmation%20of%20supreme%20court%20nominee%20Brett%20Kavanaugh%20on%2028%20September%202018%20in%20Chicago%2C%20Illinois.%20&amp;right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F740b54cf6290e7ca75a9b678fc772255ac71d9ed%3Fcrop%3D0_105_3000_1800&amp;right-caption=Advocates%20for%20sexual%20abuse%20survivors%20protest%20Brett%20Kavanaugh%20on%2028%20September%202018%20in%20Chicago%2C%20Illinois.%20Photos%20by%20Scott%20Olson%2FGetty%20Images&amp;always-place-captions-below=false\" data-alt=\"Photos\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Fdaf70c884450e407aa8dbb9a836c74a28259113a%3Fcrop%3D0_191_3000_1800&left-caption=Demonstrators%20protest%20against%20the%20confirmation%20of%20supreme%20court%20nominee%20Brett%20Kavanaugh%20on%2028%20September%202018%20in%20Chicago%2C%20Illinois.%20&right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F740b54cf6290e7ca75a9b678fc772255ac71d9ed%3Fcrop%3D0_105_3000_1800&right-caption=Advocates%20for%20sexual%20abuse%20survivors%20protest%20Brett%20Kavanaugh%20on%2028%20September%202018%20in%20Chicago%2C%20Illinois.%20Photos%20by%20Scott%20Olson%2FGetty%20Images&always-place-captions-below=false\">Photos</a> </figure>  <p>The book recounts a meeting, earlier this year, of several high-profile figures of the #MeToo stories \u2013 Ford, Paltrow, Madden and others as they reflect on the personal effects of coming forward and ponder the unresolved questions of the movement.

      "bodyText": "On Wednesday, 4 October 2017, the New York Times reporters Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor were finalizing their expos\u00e9 of sexual harassment allegations against Harvey Weinstein, the now-disgraced movie producer, when they received a disorienting call: Weinstein, from whom they were expecting a final statement after months of intense investigative work, was approaching the building. In minutes, he\u2019d be on their doorstep with a small army of powerful supporters in tow \u2013 including the feminist lawyer Lisa Bloom and the former sex crimes prosecutor Linda Fairstein \u2013 in a last-ditch effort to kill their story. After months of on-record only communication, would they take the meeting? The fittingly cinematic episode is one of many explosive revelations in She Said, Twohey and Kantor\u2019s book detailing their sprawling investigation into Weinstein\u2019s alleged sexual predation \u2013 which won a Pulitzer, along with Ronan Farrow\u2019s expos\u00e9 for the New Yorker \u2013 and its aftermath as gasoline for the #MeToo movement. Twohey and Kantor\u2019s 3,300-word article, the first of many on Weinstein, triggered an avalanche of women\u2019s accounts of sexual harassment and assault under the hashtag #MeToo, first coined years earlier by the activist Tarana Burke. Since then, the tide of pent-up frustration and calls for accountability have exposed and stalled the careers of prominent men such as Matt Lauer, Charlie Rose and Les Moonves, to name a few. (Weinstein, whose criminal trial for rape and predatory sexual assault has been delayed until January 2020, has denied all allegations of non-consensual sex and pleaded not guilty.) The final showdown with Weinstein is just one of several revelations in She Said that portend a much deeper story than the one which seized headlines two years ago. \u201cWe pretty quickly realized that our first Weinstein articles were actually just the beginning,\u201d Twohey told the Guardian in an interview. \u201cWith this book, we were able to piece together so many more pieces of the puzzle.\u201d She Said stitches together remarkable elements previously unknown to the public, including: a long-sought interview with Bob Weinstein, the mogul\u2019s brother and lifelong business partner, in which he claims he disastrously mischaracterized and enabled his brother\u2019s actions as extramarital affairs born of sex addiction. It details the previously unrevealed story of Irwin Reiter, Weinstein\u2019s corporate accountant for over 30 years, who served as the investigation\u2019s \u201cdeep throat\u201d by providing crucial company documents in the final stages. And it describes how the famed attorney Gloria Allred cultivated a public reputation as a feminist crusader while she and her firm privately negotiated and buried sexual harassment settlements for victims \u2013 including of Weinstein and the Olympic gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar \u2013 from which they took a 30% to 40% cut. There\u2019s also a damning memo from Allred\u2019s similarly notorious daughter, Lisa Bloom, who was paid $895 an hour by Weinstein for counsel on \u201cpositive reputation management\u201d. (Bloom later told the reporters that her work for Weinstein was a \u201ccolossal mistake\u201d.) Supporting these bombshells are a mountain of smaller, quieter yet still powerful actions \u2013 Kantor fielding nervous texts from Gwyneth Paltrow as she deliberated going on the record (which she ultimately did in the second article, published on 10 October), or crafting the perfectly calibrated email to coax the actor Rose McGowan into a phone call. There\u2019s Twohey, knocking on the door of a woman who mysteriously left Weinstein\u2019s company in 1990, skillfully volleying small talk into an interview pitch. And there\u2019s an email from Laura Madden, one of the first women to go on the record against Weinstein, recounting how a conversation with her teenage daughters anchored her decision to speak. More than anything, She Said depicts the incremental work of pulling at long-neglected threads as well as the institutional heft and individual bravery required to hold powerful abuses to account. But She Said goes much deeper than a compelling play-by-play of nailing the first Weinstein story. The immediate aftermath of publication, when the dam broke on story after story of sexual indignity, workplace harassment, or assault, \u201conly made us feel greater responsibility\u201d, Kantor told the Guardian. \u201cWe said to ourselves: we\u2019ve got to try to finally answer some of these lingering questions from the Weinstein story. How can a company become so complicit in predation? What are the systems that enable this kind of abuse? In the face of a \u201cstaggering\u201d wave of personal and institutional responses, said Twohey, \u201cWe just decided that the most important thing we could do was keep reporting.\u201d That reporting unmasked a decades-long culture of complicity at the Weinstein Company and its forerunner, Miramax, which prized protection from liability over protection of women, and a shadowy cottage industry of out-of-court settlements for victims of harassment and assault sealed with punishing non-disclosure agreements. One Weinstein accuser, Zelda Perkins, revealed to Kantor and Twohey an agreement which prohibited her from discussing her employment at Miramax with anyone, including talking to a therapist without a confidentiality agreement, or even obtaining a full copy of the contract. But a brave few did speak out and the book reveals their personal journeys to going public for the first time: Laura Madden, the first woman to speak out against Weinstein on-record in an interview, who participated days before a mastectomy and reconstructive surgery for breast cancer. Rowena Chiu, who didn\u2019t tell her family about her 1998 settlement with Weinstein until after Kantor arrived at her Silicon Valley home, now on the record for the first time. And Perkins, formerly of the Miramax London office, who \u201calways had a larger vision of what this was about\u201d, said Kantor. \u201cShe said even as early as that, this isn\u2019t about getting Harvey; this is about an entire system that silences women.\u201d In the preface, Kantor and Twohey explicitly pose the question: did the cultural change go too far? Or not far enough? It\u2019s less the reporters\u2019 paradigm than \u201cthe question we saw play out in the world\u201d, said Kantor. \u201cWe experienced the power of the post-Weinstein reckoning and this feeling of buried truth pouring out \u2013 this display of mass accountability without precedent.\u201d But they also watched the conversations around #MeToo get complicated, and polarizing. The past two years have revealed \u201cthree questions about #MeToo that remain totally unresolved\u201d, said Kantor \u2013 what behaviors are under scrutiny? What tools can evaluate truth? And what are the appropriate measures for accountability and punishment? Nearly a year ago, Kantor and Twohey watched as a previously unknown psychology professor from Palo Alto, California, testified before the Senate judiciary committee about her allegation of sexual assault, in high school, by the then supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. The final two chapters of She Said follow the personal journey of Dr Christine Blasey Ford as she deliberated over going public with her story \u2013 a journey more fraught than previously revealed. The book recounts a meeting, earlier this year, of several high-profile figures of the #MeToo stories \u2013 Ford, Paltrow, Madden and others as they reflect on the personal effects of coming forward and ponder the unresolved questions of the movement. What is clear, said Kantor, is that \u201cnone of us are done dealing with what\u2019s happened in the past. You can\u2019t fix a problem you can\u2019t see. And it\u2019s become clear that all of us collectively are still in the process of seeing this problem clearly.\u201d For the book, part of that clarity resides in upholding and demystifying the \u201crigorous standards\u201d of investigative journalism. With She Said, \u201cI want [readers] to feel ultimately that carefully documented stories, high-quality journalism really can fuel social progress,\u201d said Kantor. \u201cAt a time when even the truth can feel so compromised and everything can feel so stuck, I want them to believe in that power, that potential.\u201d",

Fierce opposition to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was a signature issue of his 2010 campaign.

This meant the state, which had an estimated HIV population of 135,000, had an annual diagnosis rate per 100,000 residents of 27, second only to Georgia\u2019s 30 and nearly double New York\u2019s 16.</p> <p>Of 10 states that currently see the most annual HIV diagnoses and which together account for 65% of new cases nationally, Florida was alone in experiencing an increase, of nearly 3%, between 2010 and 2017. <a href=\"http://etedashboardny.org/\">New York</a>, which has spent aggressively on HIV and expanded Medicaid, saw a decrease of 30%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f6444e497eae68ee710434befc7062034b5bd29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f6444e497eae68ee710434befc7062034b5bd29/0_0_2302_1644/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New York governor Andrew Cuomo announces a new plan to tackle his state\u2019s HIV epidemic, in April 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"714\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, announces a new plan to tackle his state\u2019s HIV epidemic in April 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Benjamin Ryan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>HIV diagnoses actually declined in Florida for at least five years through 2013, when they hit 4,315, only to increase by nearly 11% through 2017: the very period when the state missed out on tens of millions of dollars in federal funds.</p> <p>The fact that a financial scandal of this magnitude has remained out of the headlines is testament to the Florida health department\u2019s strict management structure: the governor at the top followed by the surgeon general, who is secretary of the department, on down through state and county health departments.</p> <p>Employees from the HIV section said that in the latter years of the Scott administration they worked under intense pressure to meet the hierarchy\u2019s wishes, which were often guided by the governor\u2019s political priorities.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>How many infections could have been prevented with that money? How many lives could have been saved? Shame on them</p> <footer> <cite>Marlene LaLota</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In blocking the federal funds for the epidemic, a health department administrator with close ties to Scott\u2019s office effectively leaned on state budget rules that for the HIV bureau meant receipt of these funds would be considered a state budget increase, requiring legislative approval.</p> <p>The financial morass in the HIV bureau began in 2012, after it began reporting to the <a href=\"https://www.hrsa.gov/\">US Health Resources and Services Administration</a> (HRSA) the receipt of rebates \u2013 effectively drug discounts, governed by a federal law called 340B \u2013 from pharmaceutical companies for the purchase of medications for lower-income people with HIV, under the state\u2019s Aids Drug Assistance Program (Adap).</p> <p>According to budget documents obtained through a freedom-of-information request to HRSA, which oversees Adap, Florida received $6.2m in 340B rebates under the program during the 2012 to 2013 fiscal year. As the state department of health began implementing <a href=\"https://flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2012/1263/?Tab=Analyses\">legislation</a> that required the reduction and reorganization of the department, the annual 340B rebate tally rose unabated, doubling each of the subsequent two years, hitting $33.6m in 2015 and peaking at $86.4m in 2017.</p> <p>HRSA accounting rules helped tee up the loss of a considerable chunk of those funds.</p> <p>Adap spending in Florida derives primarily from the HRSA-directed Ryan White program, specifically its Part B funding stream, which has granted the state between $117m and $128m annually since 2012. HRSA requires that during each fiscal year, states must first spend all of their Adap-related 340B rebate funds \u2013 which by law must go to Ryan White programming \u2013 before dipping into that year\u2019s Part B grant.</p> <p>Both LaLota\u2019s predecessors as head of Florida\u2019s HIV bureau, Sherry Riley and Tom Liberti, who spanned 1996 to 2014, said they were always able to secure necessary budget authority increases and never received pushback against related requests from upper management.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/10/juul-is-the-new-big-tobacco-wave-of-lawsuits-signal-familiar-problems\">Is Juul the new big tobacco?

Refusing federal funds became less of a priority for his administration.</p> <p>All told, the Florida health department lost out on $53,837,844 \u2013 funding that could have had a profound impact on a growing HIV crisis but went to other states instead.</p> <p>HRSA\u2019s discussions with the Florida health department, the federal agency reported, indicated that budget authority matters were greatest obstacle to the state\u2019s ability to spend these funds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8ae5e67d63a0f06c6e1c1dda487e2506a1a3247e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ae5e67d63a0f06c6e1c1dda487e2506a1a3247e/0_203_6102_3661/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marlene LaLota, a 28-year veteran of the Florida department of health. \u2018I think Rick Scott fueled the epidemic in Florida.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marlene LaLota, a 28-year veteran of the Florida department of health. \u2018I think Rick Scott fueled the epidemic in Florida.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Ryan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>LaLota reported that the Scott administration forbade anyone on her team from discussing budget concerns directly with legislators.</p> <p>\u201cRick Scott had us all on lockdown,\u201d LaLota said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t used to be like that with previous governors.\u201d</p> <p>In a statement, a Scott spokeswoman said the overall assertions of this article were inaccurate.</p> <p>\u201cThe state could only spend the money that it had the budget authority to spend,\u201d the spokeswoman said, indicating that the legislature was responsible for such matters.</p> <p>The Florida health department did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p> <p>Kellie Wilcox, who handled budgets for Florida\u2019s HIV program under LaLota, said when she came on board in 2014, the director of the health department\u2019s office of budget and revenue management, <a href=\"http://www.floridahealth.gov/about/leadership/deputy-secretary-for-operations.html\">Michele Tallent</a>, who assumed that title in <a href=\"http://www.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/2016/11/112816-Michele-Tallent.html\">March that year</a>, was the sole official with the authority to send budget-authority requests up the chain of command.</p> <p>According to Wilcox and LaLota, Tallent stonewalled their increasingly desperate requests to release surplus HRSA funds. They speculated Tallent was following orders from the governor\u2019s office.</p> <p>Tallent, a Republican who was previously budget chief for the health and human services unit with the governor\u2019s office of policy and budget, was also responsible for requesting carryover from HRSA.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My sense is frankly that [the HIV crisis] just wasn\u2019t a priority for Scott</p> <footer> <cite>William McColl, Aids United</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>LaLota said: \u201cI wrote a plan to end the epidemic.

Wilcox said her replacement, Ty Gentle, was much more sympathetic. But his hands were apparently tied.

The department has not said why. Attempts to reach Tallent were not successful.</p> <h2>\u2018More ideological than considerate\u2019</h2> <p>In 2015, the Scott administration blocked another huge chunk of federal money, this time from the CDC.</p> <p>The agency offered health departments in cities with the most intense epidemics the chance to apply for a pair of grants to support HIV prevention, including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and improved care and treatment for those with the virus.</p> <p>Miami was poised to receive about $7.6m over four years while Broward would probably have received some $8.7m over three. New York City applied for the same two grants and received $16.9m.</p> <p>Stephen Fallon, executive director of the Aids service organization Latinos Salud, wrote the majority of Miami\u2019s grant application and routed it through the state health department, as required.</p> <p>Hours before the 1 June 2015 deadline, LaLota said, she got word from her superior that the governor\u2019s office had denied both counties permission to apply. The grounds: a lack of budget authority to spend such new money.</p> <p>Broward was forced to rescind the application it had sent to the CDC. A CDC representative confirmed its August 2015 request to do so.</p> <p>\u201cI was perhaps naive,\u201d Fallon recalled. \u201cI knew that policies can be more ideological than considerate of the constituents in the state of Florida.

      "bodyText": "While the Republican senator Rick Scott was governor of Florida, his administration presided over the effective blocking of $70m in federal funds available for fighting the state\u2019s HIV crisis. Coupled with the fact that Scott refused to expand Medicaid in Florida, this new revelation \u2013 the product of an extensive Guardian investigation \u2013 helps explain why the state\u2019s HIV epidemic became almost peerlessly severe during Scott\u2019s time in office. From 2015 to 2017, Florida was forced to return to the federal government $54m in unspent grants for combating HIV \u2013 due to an apparently deliberate failure on the part of state health bosses to secure legislative permission to spend such desperately needed funds. Furthermore, in 2015 Scott\u2019s administration directly blocked two US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) grant applications that would probably have won Miami and Broward counties, which have HIV diagnosis rates among the highest in the US, approximately $16m. For Scott, refusing federal money was a bedrock principle. Fierce opposition to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was a signature issue of his 2010 campaign. In one of his first acts in office, he rejected more than $2bn for high-speed rail. He would turn away scores of millions of dollars in ACA grants. By early 2013, Scott softened his stance and proposed a three-year Medicaid expansion test run. But he never made any attempts to get the legislature on board and after securing a second term in 2014 the former healthcare executive with a net worth exceeding $230m retreated, opposing what in other states has amounted to a massive infusion of federal funds to provide healthcare to those living in poverty. This about-face coincided with the start of Florida\u2019s rejection of the federal HIV funding in question. \u201cI think Rick Scott fueled the epidemic in Florida,\u201d said Marlene LaLota, a 28-year veteran of the Florida department of health who was the administrator of its HIV/Aids section from 2014 to 2016. \u201cHow many infections could have been prevented with that money? How many lives could have been saved? Shame on them.\u201d \u2018We were stopped at every turn\u2019 According to the CDC, in 2017 Florida saw the highest number of new HIV diagnoses in the US: 4,783 cases, or 13% of the national total. This meant the state, which had an estimated HIV population of 135,000, had an annual diagnosis rate per 100,000 residents of 27, second only to Georgia\u2019s 30 and nearly double New York\u2019s 16. Of 10 states that currently see the most annual HIV diagnoses and which together account for 65% of new cases nationally, Florida was alone in experiencing an increase, of nearly 3%, between 2010 and 2017. New York, which has spent aggressively on HIV and expanded Medicaid, saw a decrease of 30%. HIV diagnoses actually declined in Florida for at least five years through 2013, when they hit 4,315, only to increase by nearly 11% through 2017: the very period when the state missed out on tens of millions of dollars in federal funds. The fact that a financial scandal of this magnitude has remained out of the headlines is testament to the Florida health department\u2019s strict management structure: the governor at the top followed by the surgeon general, who is secretary of the department, on down through state and county health departments. Employees from the HIV section said that in the latter years of the Scott administration they worked under intense pressure to meet the hierarchy\u2019s wishes, which were often guided by the governor\u2019s political priorities. In blocking the federal funds for the epidemic, a health department administrator with close ties to Scott\u2019s office effectively leaned on state budget rules that for the HIV bureau meant receipt of these funds would be considered a state budget increase, requiring legislative approval. The financial morass in the HIV bureau began in 2012, after it began reporting to the US Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) the receipt of rebates \u2013 effectively drug discounts, governed by a federal law called 340B \u2013 from pharmaceutical companies for the purchase of medications for lower-income people with HIV, under the state\u2019s Aids Drug Assistance Program (Adap). According to budget documents obtained through a freedom-of-information request to HRSA, which oversees Adap, Florida received $6.2m in 340B rebates under the program during the 2012 to 2013 fiscal year. As the state department of health began implementing legislation that required the reduction and reorganization of the department, the annual 340B rebate tally rose unabated, doubling each of the subsequent two years, hitting $33.6m in 2015 and peaking at $86.4m in 2017. HRSA accounting rules helped tee up the loss of a considerable chunk of those funds. Adap spending in Florida derives primarily from the HRSA-directed Ryan White program, specifically its Part B funding stream, which has granted the state between $117m and $128m annually since 2012. HRSA requires that during each fiscal year, states must first spend all of their Adap-related 340B rebate funds \u2013 which by law must go to Ryan White programming \u2013 before dipping into that year\u2019s Part B grant. Both LaLota\u2019s predecessors as head of Florida\u2019s HIV bureau, Sherry Riley and Tom Liberti, who spanned 1996 to 2014, said they were always able to secure necessary budget authority increases and never received pushback against related requests from upper management. In 2014, the year LaLota took the helm, the department submitted what according to publicly available state documents would be the last request for an increase in budget authority for three fiscal years. Multiple legislators who during that period sat on the legislative budget commission, which in many cases processes agency requests for budget authority increases, said they never heard a word about the brewing financial catastrophe within the HIV department. According to HRSA, during the 2014 and 2015 fiscal years the health department did not engage in the routine practice of asking the federal agency for permission to carry over unspent Part B funds. Consequently, the department was forced to return to HRSA $23.9m in unspent part B grants for HIV in 2015, then $29.2m in 2016 and $767,364 in 2017. In 2017, Scott shifted focus to a Senate race in which he appealed to centrist or populist interests. Refusing federal funds became less of a priority for his administration. All told, the Florida health department lost out on $53,837,844 \u2013 funding that could have had a profound impact on a growing HIV crisis but went to other states instead. HRSA\u2019s discussions with the Florida health department, the federal agency reported, indicated that budget authority matters were greatest obstacle to the state\u2019s ability to spend these funds. LaLota reported that the Scott administration forbade anyone on her team from discussing budget concerns directly with legislators. \u201cRick Scott had us all on lockdown,\u201d LaLota said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t used to be like that with previous governors.\u201d In a statement, a Scott spokeswoman said the overall assertions of this article were inaccurate. \u201cThe state could only spend the money that it had the budget authority to spend,\u201d the spokeswoman said, indicating that the legislature was responsible for such matters. The Florida health department did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Kellie Wilcox, who handled budgets for Florida\u2019s HIV program under LaLota, said when she came on board in 2014, the director of the health department\u2019s office of budget and revenue management, Michele Tallent, who assumed that title in March that year, was the sole official with the authority to send budget-authority requests up the chain of command. According to Wilcox and LaLota, Tallent stonewalled their increasingly desperate requests to release surplus HRSA funds. They speculated Tallent was following orders from the governor\u2019s office. Tallent, a Republican who was previously budget chief for the health and human services unit with the governor\u2019s office of policy and budget, was also responsible for requesting carryover from HRSA. LaLota said: \u201cI wrote a plan to end the epidemic. But we were stopped at every turn. I could not give that money away to save my life. It was so criminal and so egregious.\u201d LaLota is now a senior regional director at Aids Healthcare Foundation in New York. The global non-profit is in a legal battle with Florida over a cancelled Medicaid contract \u2013 a dispute in which LaLota said she had no professional stake. In 2016, Tallent was promoted to deputy secretary for operations in the health department. Wilcox said her replacement, Ty Gentle, was much more sympathetic. But his hands were apparently tied. Tallent still held ultimate control over the forwarding of budget-authority increase requests. On 16 July 2019, the health department placed Tallent on paid administrative leave, pending an internal investigation. The department has not said why. Attempts to reach Tallent were not successful. \u2018More ideological than considerate\u2019 In 2015, the Scott administration blocked another huge chunk of federal money, this time from the CDC. The agency offered health departments in cities with the most intense epidemics the chance to apply for a pair of grants to support HIV prevention, including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and improved care and treatment for those with the virus. Miami was poised to receive about $7.6m over four years while Broward would probably have received some $8.7m over three. New York City applied for the same two grants and received $16.9m. Stephen Fallon, executive director of the Aids service organization Latinos Salud, wrote the majority of Miami\u2019s grant application and routed it through the state health department, as required. Hours before the 1 June 2015 deadline, LaLota said, she got word from her superior that the governor\u2019s office had denied both counties permission to apply. The grounds: a lack of budget authority to spend such new money. Broward was forced to rescind the application it had sent to the CDC. A CDC representative confirmed its August 2015 request to do so. \u201cI was perhaps naive,\u201d Fallon recalled. \u201cI knew that policies can be more ideological than considerate of the constituents in the state of Florida. But I didn\u2019t assume the Scott administration would be anti\u2013HIV funding in any way.\u201d The following year, Scott\u2019s office boasted that the state had \u201cinvested a record $34m in HIV/Aids prevention\u201d in 2015, despite the fact almost the entire referenced sum came from existing CDC grants, and that the main reason the figure had risen was because so had HIV diagnoses. The statement from Senator Scott\u2019s representative repeated this refrain, claiming that as governor he \u201cinvested record funding in HIV/Aids prevention\u201d. \u201cMy sense is frankly that [the HIV crisis] just wasn\u2019t a priority for Scott,\u201d said William McColl, vice-president for policy and advocacy at Aids United. \u201cHe clearly thinks of healthcare as a profit source.\u201d McColl was alluding to the governor\u2019s former role as chief executive and co-founder of the healthcare conglomerate Columbia/HCA. Between 2000 and 2002, that company reached a $1.7bn fraud settlement with the US justice department \u2013 a record for a hospital corporation \u2013 while pleading guilty to 14 criminal counts over accusations of defrauding Medicaid, Medicare and other government programs. Scott resigned from Columbia/HCA in 1997, four months after the federal inquiry came to light, and has denied any knowledge of wrongdoing. In a deposition in 2000 for a civil suit, he pleaded the fifth 75 times to refrain from incriminating himself, compelled to do so, his lawyer said, by the criminal case. Today in Washington, Scott sits on the Senate committee on the budget. This fall, he will be in a position to cast a floor vote on the Senate\u2019s proposal for the first year of a Trump\u2013backed plan calling for $291m to battle the national epidemic. \u201cSenator Scott supports efforts by the administration to make sure everyone is getting the care they need,\u201d his spokesperson said. The national plan will target 48 hard-hit counties in particular. Seven are in Scott\u2019s home state. Additional reporting by Noah Pransky. Benjamin Ryan can be contacted via Twitter",

The gender pay gap in Australia \u2013 the difference between average full-time earnings for men and women \u2013 sits at 14% on the <a href=\"https://www.wgea.gov.au/data/fact-sheets/australias-gender-pay-gap-statistics\">latest figures</a> from the Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA).</p> <p>That\u2019s definitely a significant reduction from its peak in November 2014, when it hit 18.1%.

Not really. As one of Australia\u2019s foremost experts on gender and work, Professor Rae Cooper from the University of Sydney <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Raecooper1/status/1161899638086963201\">noted</a> when the latest statistics were released, the reduction in the pay gap over the last five years has coincided with a period of \u201cchronically depressed male wages\u201d.</p> <p>That is, a large proportion of the decrease in the pay gap can be attributed to falling average full-time incomes for men over the last five years \u2013 a result largely due to the collapse of employment in the mining sector, as the end of the boom and a rapid uptake of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jan/20/autonomous-mining-will-cost-jobs-and-tax-income-its-time-for-governments-to-act\">automation</a> has seen high-paid jobs, disproportionately held by men, disappear.</p> <p>For the treasurer to claim victory over a reduction in the gender pay gap that has largely resulted from lower incomes and fewer jobs for men sounds entirely the wrong note \u2013 and is clearly at odds with the prime minister\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.sbs.com.au/news/scott-morrison-says-the-rise-of-women-should-not-come-at-the-expense-of-men\">statement</a> on International Women\u2019s Day this year that \u201c\u2026we don\u2019t want to see women rise only on the basis of others doing worse\u201d.</p> <p>The fact is, the gender pay gap in Australia remains stubbornly high \u2013 but in itself, it only tells half the story. The pay gap is calculated by comparing average full-time earnings for men and women across society \u2013 apples with apples, so to speak.</p> <p>But the difference in lifetime earnings for men and women in Australia \u2013 which leads to outcomes such as women retiring with 47% less <a href=\"https://percapita.org.au/our_work/not-so-super-for-women/\">superannuation</a> than men \u2013 results from more insidious, and intractable, forces than the difference in full-time earnings.</p> <p>For a start, women in Australia are far more likely than those in comparable nations to work part-time. ABS data <a href=\"https://www.employment.gov.au/newsroom/statistical-snapshot-women-australian-workforce\">shows</a> that women make up just 37% of full-time employees, but 68.7% of part-time employees.</p> <p>Among OECD nations, only in Switzerland, the Netherlands, Austria and Germany are a higher proportion of women working part-time. OECD <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/social/australia-should-help-more-women-and-other-underemployed-groups-into-work.htm\">figures</a> also show the employment rate of women in Australia aged between 25 and 54 years is in the lower third of OECD countries.</p> <p>This is due to the fact that Australia is stuck in the \u201cmale bread-winner\u201d model of family income. Even as women have entered the workforce in huge numbers over the last four decades, the \u201cneo-traditional\u201d family structure \u2013 in which the man works full-time and the woman only part-time in paid employment, while the woman undertakes the majority of unpaid care and domestic labour in the home \u2013 is the dominant one among Australian heterosexual couple households.</p> <p>The nature of work in Australia is also highly segregated along gender lines. The latest <a href=\"https://www.wgea.gov.au/data/fact-sheets/gender-segregation-in-australias-workforce\">data</a> from the Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA) demonstrates that \u201c\u2026the majority of Australian employees continue to work in industries dominated by one gender. Only 46.5% of employed Australians work in gender mixed organisations\u201d.</p> <p>This has a significant impact on the gender pay gap, because professions in which the workforce is dominated by women are significantly underpaid. The WGEA data conclusively shows that people working in industries with a predominantly female workforce have lower salaries than those working in male-dominated industries.</p> <p>In short, we have a long way to go before we will see the gender pay gap close. If we are to get there, we need to understand and address the real causes of women\u2019s income inequality in Australia.</p> <p>Facing up to the facts about the gender pay gap is the least we can expect of the man in charge of the national economy.<br></p> <ul> <li><p>Emma Dawson is Executive Director of public policy think tank Per Capita</p></li> </ul>",

As one of Australia\u2019s foremost experts on gender and work, Professor Rae Cooper from the University of Sydney noted when the latest statistics were released, the reduction in the pay gap over the last five years has coincided with a period of \u201cchronically depressed male wages\u201d. That is, a large proportion of the decrease in the pay gap can be attributed to falling average full-time incomes for men over the last five years \u2013 a result largely due to the collapse of employment in the mining sector, as the end of the boom and a rapid uptake of automation has seen high-paid jobs, disproportionately held by men, disappear. For the treasurer to claim victory over a reduction in the gender pay gap that has largely resulted from lower incomes and fewer jobs for men sounds entirely the wrong note \u2013 and is clearly at odds with the prime minister\u2019s statement on International Women\u2019s Day this year that \u201c\u2026we don\u2019t want to see women rise only on the basis of others doing worse\u201d. The fact is, the gender pay gap in Australia remains stubbornly high \u2013 but in itself, it only tells half the story. The pay gap is calculated by comparing average full-time earnings for men and women across society \u2013 apples with apples, so to speak. But the difference in lifetime earnings for men and women in Australia \u2013 which leads to outcomes such as women retiring with 47% less superannuation than men \u2013 results from more insidious, and intractable, forces than the difference in full-time earnings. For a start, women in Australia are far more likely than those in comparable nations to work part-time. ABS data shows that women make up just 37% of full-time employees, but 68.7% of part-time employees. Among OECD nations, only in Switzerland, the Netherlands, Austria and Germany are a higher proportion of women working part-time. OECD figures also show the employment rate of women in Australia aged between 25 and 54 years is in the lower third of OECD countries. This is due to the fact that Australia is stuck in the \u201cmale bread-winner\u201d model of family income. Even as women have entered the workforce in huge numbers over the last four decades, the \u201cneo-traditional\u201d family structure \u2013 in which the man works full-time and the woman only part-time in paid employment, while the woman undertakes the majority of unpaid care and domestic labour in the home \u2013 is the dominant one among Australian heterosexual couple households. The nature of work in Australia is also highly segregated along gender lines. The latest data from the Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA) demonstrates that \u201c\u2026the majority of Australian employees continue to work in industries dominated by one gender. Only 46.5% of employed Australians work in gender mixed organisations\u201d. This has a significant impact on the gender pay gap, because professions in which the workforce is dominated by women are significantly underpaid. The WGEA data conclusively shows that people working in industries with a predominantly female workforce have lower salaries than those working in male-dominated industries. In short, we have a long way to go before we will see the gender pay gap close. If we are to get there, we need to understand and address the real causes of women\u2019s income inequality in Australia. Facing up to the facts about the gender pay gap is the least we can expect of the man in charge of the national economy. Emma Dawson is Executive Director of public policy think tank Per Capita",

Over the past five years Public Health England has identified 32 \u201cpan-drug resistant bacteria\u201d that could not be killed by any antibiotic; while in the last decade UK scientists have identified 19 new ways that bacteria resist the drugs. On Wednesday they announced a new strain of group A streptococcus suspected of causing a big rise in children getting scarlet fever and throat infections. It can also cause sepsis or toxic shock. NHS England says it is reducing use of antibiotics to keep them as effective as possible, with patients offered other treatments. The annual death toll resulting from antibiotic resistance stands at 2,200. * * * Set to stun \u2013 DNA research has revealed two entirely new species of electric eel in the Amazon basin, including one capable of delivering a record-breaking jolt of 860 volts, much more than existing record of 650 volts. The new kind is called Electrophorus voltai and scientists say it is \u201cthe strongest bioelectricity generator known\u201d. Electric eels \u2013 actually fish \u2013 generate electricity from three specialised electric organs that can emit charges of varying strengths.

Lunchtime read: When cooks can kill In an Amsterdam restaurant, Ben Feltwell wanted to make sure there was no egg in the pastry he had ordered. The waiter went off and checked with the kitchen. \u201cHe spoke with the chef and came back and said it was OK.\u201d Feltwell bit into the pastry \u2013 and immediately had an allergic reaction. The chef insisted: \u201cWell, we make the pastry with egg, but then we fry it and bake it, so there\u2019s no egg left!\u201d Feltwell spent the next four hours vomiting in his hotel room. It\u2019s not just chefs Feltwell needs to watch out for. Once, on a camping holiday, a companion slipped an egg into his curry. \u201cHe was trying to make the point that my egg allergy wasn\u2019t real \u2026 It ruined the holiday.\u201d Others have similar tales: mushroom powder hidden in mashed potatoes, beef unthinkingly cooked in beer and served to a gluten-intolerant person. As Sirin Kale writes, well-publicised fatalities like that of 15-year-old Natasha Ednan-Laperouse \u2013 who died from eating a baguette not labelled as containing sesame \u2013 seem not to have deterred chefs, friends and even relations from trying to mislead or trick food allergy sufferers into eating dangerously. Sport Jadon Sancho scored his first two goals for England in a wild 5-3 win over Kosovo on a night when they were 1-0 down in the first minute and Harry Kane missed a penalty. Joe Root is under \u201cno pressure\u201d as England cricket captain, according to outgoing coach Trevor Bayliss. Jimmy Anderson believes he can become the world\u2019s No 1 Test bowler once more and, to make this goal a reality, now plans to study how other elite athletes prolong their careers. Alun Wyn Jones leads Wales on to the plane bound for Tokyo on Wednesday for his fourth Rugby World Cup, hoping the tournament will not be scarred by a flurry of red cards for dangerous tackles. And anti-discrimination groups have urged the French Football Federation president, No\u00ebl Le Gra\u00ebt, to resign after he said matches should no longer be stopped when there is homophobic chanting. Business The government must take urgent action to protect Britain\u2019s high streets, retailers and unions say, as a new study reveals that shop closures are occurring at their fastest rate for a decade. The analysis says an average of 16 shops, pubs and restaurants are shutting every day and only nine are taking their place. Asian investors have maintained the optimistic mood in financial markets as hopes of a US-China trade agreement rise. The FTSE100 is set to pick up the vibe with a rise of 0.4% at the opening. The pound is up to $1.236 and \u20ac1.118. The papers The Guardian reports this morning: \u201cRetailers urge ministers to step in as high street store closures soar\u201d and the Express has: \u201cScandal of care homes evicting elderly\u201d.

Over the years since, it has played second fiddle to its big brother in the north \u2013 but it has an obvious and growing belief in its own charms, news of which is starting to spread.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/sep/2019-09-10T15:38:26.html\" data-alt=\"Utrecht map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/sep/2019-09-10T15:38:26.html\">Utrecht map</a> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s three years since my previous visit, and this time I hear some Utrechters complaining that the centre \u2013 a picture-postcard Dutch feast of canals, curving cobbled streets and baroque and Gothic medieval architecture \u2013 has become a little over-full of tourists. Even in high season that is very much relative, however, especially when compared with Amsterdam. In fact, it\u2019s outside the centre that parts of the city have become hotspots lately, as new businesses look for cheaper rents, and residents and in-the-know visitors look for new hangouts off the beaten track.</p> <p>Rotsoord, a former industrial area south of the centre, has seen an influx of creatives, startups, independent stores, bars and restaurants in the past couple of years. Cartesius, to the west, has also been partially transformed by the arrival of various DIY venues, cafes and cultural organisations, among them cinema, cafe and club <a href=\"https://www.filmcafe.nl\" title=\"\">Filmcafe</a>, art space and cafe <a href=\"http://denijverheid.com\" title=\"\">De Nijverheid</a>, brewery, bar and restaurant <a href=\"http://www.deleckere.nl\" title=\"\">De Leckere</a> and club venue <a href=\"https://www.was030.nl/\" title=\"\">WAS</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0daf32570e3e5972ea369ec325e5f79b30b7d00\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0daf32570e3e5972ea369ec325e5f79b30b7d00/0_236_3543_2126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bus stops now have plants on the roof, which attracts bees .\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bus stops now have plants on the roof, which attracts bees .</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Barbra Verbij/Clear Channel</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lombok, one of the city\u2019s most culturally diverse neighbourhoods, is home to the Utrecht Central Mosque (affectionately known as \u201cthe techno mosque\u201d for its gigantic neon-lit minarets) and the increasingly popular thoroughfare Kanaalstraat, lined with Turkish and Moroccan grocery stores, bakeries, cafes and kebab shops.</p> <p>I based myself in the old centre and explored by bike. Even in the context of the Netherlands, Utrecht is an exceptional cycling city, ranking <a href=\"https://copenhagenizeindex.eu/\" title=\"\">third in the world on the 2019 Copenhagenize list</a>, and as of August 2019 is home to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/aug/19/dutch-take-cycling-to-a-new-level-with-worlds-biggest-bike-park\" title=\"\">world\u2019s largest multi-storey bike park</a>. The network of buses and trams is comprehensive (a day ticket is \u20ac6.20) but the layout of Utrecht\u2019s ancient central streets often creates congestion, so biking really is best for anyone who can.</p> <h2><strong>Food and drink</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f8dac0e01ace2bdd94c7ba586708cdb08c6d4271\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8dac0e01ace2bdd94c7ba586708cdb08c6d4271/0_71_5287_3172/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kromme Haring brewpub.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">De Kromme Haring brewpub.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ruud Vonk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Utrecht\u2019s beer bars are the stuff of fantasy for beer lovers, with encyclopaedic menus, reasonable prices and only a light hipsterisation in even the newest and most cutting-edge places. The canalside <a href=\"http://www.kafebelgie.nl/\" title=\"\">Kafe Belgie</a> opened in 1984 and is a beloved, no-nonsense institution offering around 200 brews, its looming slat-board menu watched over by a statue of the Virgin Mary tightly clutching a rainbow Pride flag. The day I visited was the hottest in the city since records began, so refreshment was my primary consideration. I had an Alfa (\u20ac2.40) and a Martin\u2019s IPA (\u20ac4.60), and dreamed of returning when conditions were less oven-like to delve deeper into the menu.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"646e09b612a606f520de8deb33f2639a91612ed3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/646e09b612a606f520de8deb33f2639a91612ed3/0_70_4262_2557/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Caf\u00e9 Olivier.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Caf\u00e9 Olivier.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://utrecht.cafe-olivier.be/\" title=\"\">Caf\u00e9 Olivier</a> is another beloved central spot, with a wide beer selection and alarmingly moreish <em>bitterballen</em> (deep-fried beef or veal meatballs \u2013 the nation\u2019s beer snack of choice, \u20ac6.50). <a href=\"http://www.dekrommeharing.nl/\" title=\"\">De Kromme Haring</a>, a brewpub at the end of a row of startups and restaurants in Rotsoord, is a fine example of the exciting things happening away from the centre. In the spirit of adventure I tried an Electric Clownfish, a weirdly delicious coffee milk stout made using beans from the roastery next door. Informal collaborations like this between young businesses in these areas are commonplace, and contribute to the positive, forward-looking atmosphere.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/may/12/rembrandt-holland-exploring-amsterdam-leiden-the-netherlands\">Rembrandt\u2019s Holland: exploring Amsterdam and Leiden</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Back in the old centre, the basements of buildings on the Oudegracht canal create a two-level street and, very often, two levels of bars to choose from. One evening a friend and I drank a bottle of prosecco (\u20ac27) in the sunshine at <a href=\"https://www.pkutrecht.nl/en/home-eng/\" title=\"\">PK Kitchen</a> before heading downstairs to the lively terrace of the <a href=\"https://rum-club.nl/\" title=\"\">Rum Club</a> for a cocktail called I\u2019m in Love with the Coco \u2013 a gently tart, smooth, almost chewy mix of rum, coconut cream, lime, pineapple, guava and banana (\u20ac9.50) \u2013 by the water as night fell.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9adf1646c6532cc6003021d69442a47234b3f7f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9adf1646c6532cc6003021d69442a47234b3f7f2/0_178_5600_3360/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Poke Perfect.

I found a fresh, punchy and very filling salmon and avocado pok\u00e9 bowl (\u20ac11.50) at <a href=\"https://pokeperfect.nl/\" title=\"\">Pok\u00e9 Perfect</a> and a herby, creamy lamb pita (\u20ac9.50) around the corner at the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thestreetfoodclub/\" title=\"\">Streetfood Club</a>. My attempt to sample a Utrecht lunch institution in the form of the cheese, salami and vegetable-filled Broodje Mario was thwarted by the outlet of the same name being unexpectedly shut, but a bulging Parma ham, Old Amsterdam cheese, rocket and pesto roll (\u20ac5.25) from the nearby <a href=\"https://bestellen.broodjeben.com/\" title=\"\">Broodje Ben</a> food truck proved a satisfying alternative at a similarlylow cost.</p> <p>I had a memorable and far from bank-breaking dinner at the friendly <a href=\"http://restaurantsyr.nl/en/\" title=\"\">SYR</a>, where refugees and Dutch staff work together to create Syrian dishes such as <em>mashawi</em> (a lip-smacking mixed grill of chicken and beef skewers and lamb cutlets served with pita and a spicy muhammara dip, \u20ac18) and <em>makdous</em> salad (pickled baby aubergines stuffed with walnuts, red pepper and garlic, \u20ac5). An even warmer welcome awaited me at <a href=\"https://www.ethiopisch-restaurant-sunshine-utrecht.nl/\" title=\"\">Sunshine</a>, where I worked my way through a combination plate of Ethiopian dishes including <em>kitfo</em> (a dreamily succulent mix of raw beef and Ethiopian butter, \u20ac17) and <em>gommen wot</em> (kale with peppers, onions, garlic and chilli, \u20ac15). The charming and gregarious Andu, son of the owner, gave me a passionate mini seminar on the history and natural wonders of Ethiopia and even taught me a few words of his native language.</p> <h2><strong>Art and culture</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"748ac35259fd782a14afc712decd446e4a336cac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/748ac35259fd782a14afc712decd446e4a336cac/0_131_5433_3261/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Rietveld Schroder House.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Rietveld Schr\u00f6der House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Horree/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Top of anyone\u2019s cultural to-do list in Utrecht should be the wondrous <a href=\"https://www.rietveldschroderhuis.nl/en\" title=\"\">Rietveld Schr\u00f6der House</a>, a Unesco-protected semi-detached house designed by Gerrit Rietveld, architectural hero of the De Stijl art movement, founded in 1917. Tours of this design masterpiece run hourly (\u20ac17), with a guide to demonstrate various aspects of the house and an audio guide explaining the rest. It\u2019s a splendid example of De Stijl, with every room and piece of furniture showcasing the movement\u2019s core reliance on vertical and horizontal lines, primary colours and black and white. It\u2019s also ingenious, with movable walls upstairs that create rooms or open space as required, corner windows that open perpendicular to each other to create the feeling of being outside, and three-dimensional design to maximise the use of space.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"60441a040f06b94985c754ca249eaadbd28d1007\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60441a040f06b94985c754ca249eaadbd28d1007/0_91_5119_3072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dom Tower and the Oudegracht.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dom Tower and the Oudegracht.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jorg Greuel/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another must \u2013 as long as climbing 465 narrow, winding steps doesn\u2019t faze you \u2013 is the <a href=\"https://www.domtoren.nl/en\" title=\"\">Dom Tower</a>, which still dominates the skyline of the city 637 years on from its completion.

The reward for making it to the top is an unmatched panorama of the city: on a clear day you can make out Rotterdam to the west and Amsterdam to the north.

      "bodyText": "Utrecht was the most important city in the Netherlands until it was overtaken by Amsterdam in the 17th century during the Dutch golden age of trade and advances in science, art and military power. Over the years since, it has played second fiddle to its big brother in the north \u2013 but it has an obvious and growing belief in its own charms, news of which is starting to spread. It\u2019s three years since my previous visit, and this time I hear some Utrechters complaining that the centre \u2013 a picture-postcard Dutch feast of canals, curving cobbled streets and baroque and Gothic medieval architecture \u2013 has become a little over-full of tourists. Even in high season that is very much relative, however, especially when compared with Amsterdam. In fact, it\u2019s outside the centre that parts of the city have become hotspots lately, as new businesses look for cheaper rents, and residents and in-the-know visitors look for new hangouts off the beaten track. Rotsoord, a former industrial area south of the centre, has seen an influx of creatives, startups, independent stores, bars and restaurants in the past couple of years. Cartesius, to the west, has also been partially transformed by the arrival of various DIY venues, cafes and cultural organisations, among them cinema, cafe and club Filmcafe, art space and cafe De Nijverheid, brewery, bar and restaurant De Leckere and club venue WAS. Lombok, one of the city\u2019s most culturally diverse neighbourhoods, is home to the Utrecht Central Mosque (affectionately known as \u201cthe techno mosque\u201d for its gigantic neon-lit minarets) and the increasingly popular thoroughfare Kanaalstraat, lined with Turkish and Moroccan grocery stores, bakeries, cafes and kebab shops. I based myself in the old centre and explored by bike. Even in the context of the Netherlands, Utrecht is an exceptional cycling city, ranking third in the world on the 2019 Copenhagenize list, and as of August 2019 is home to the world\u2019s largest multi-storey bike park. The network of buses and trams is comprehensive (a day ticket is \u20ac6.20) but the layout of Utrecht\u2019s ancient central streets often creates congestion, so biking really is best for anyone who can. Food and drink Utrecht\u2019s beer bars are the stuff of fantasy for beer lovers, with encyclopaedic menus, reasonable prices and only a light hipsterisation in even the newest and most cutting-edge places. The canalside Kafe Belgie opened in 1984 and is a beloved, no-nonsense institution offering around 200 brews, its looming slat-board menu watched over by a statue of the Virgin Mary tightly clutching a rainbow Pride flag. The day I visited was the hottest in the city since records began, so refreshment was my primary consideration. I had an Alfa (\u20ac2.40) and a Martin\u2019s IPA (\u20ac4.60), and dreamed of returning when conditions were less oven-like to delve deeper into the menu. Caf\u00e9 Olivier is another beloved central spot, with a wide beer selection and alarmingly moreish bitterballen (deep-fried beef or veal meatballs \u2013 the nation\u2019s beer snack of choice, \u20ac6.50). De Kromme Haring, a brewpub at the end of a row of startups and restaurants in Rotsoord, is a fine example of the exciting things happening away from the centre. In the spirit of adventure I tried an Electric Clownfish, a weirdly delicious coffee milk stout made using beans from the roastery next door. Informal collaborations like this between young businesses in these areas are commonplace, and contribute to the positive, forward-looking atmosphere. Back in the old centre, the basements of buildings on the Oudegracht canal create a two-level street and, very often, two levels of bars to choose from. One evening a friend and I drank a bottle of prosecco (\u20ac27) in the sunshine at PK Kitchen before heading downstairs to the lively terrace of the Rum Club for a cocktail called I\u2019m in Love with the Coco \u2013 a gently tart, smooth, almost chewy mix of rum, coconut cream, lime, pineapple, guava and banana (\u20ac9.50) \u2013 by the water as night fell. The cost of eating out in Utrecht is similar to London, so some knowledge of economical lunch options is useful. I found a fresh, punchy and very filling salmon and avocado pok\u00e9 bowl (\u20ac11.50) at Pok\u00e9 Perfect and a herby, creamy lamb pita (\u20ac9.50) around the corner at the Streetfood Club. My attempt to sample a Utrecht lunch institution in the form of the cheese, salami and vegetable-filled Broodje Mario was thwarted by the outlet of the same name being unexpectedly shut, but a bulging Parma ham, Old Amsterdam cheese, rocket and pesto roll (\u20ac5.25) from the nearby Broodje Ben food truck proved a satisfying alternative at a similarlylow cost. I had a memorable and far from bank-breaking dinner at the friendly SYR, where refugees and Dutch staff work together to create Syrian dishes such as mashawi (a lip-smacking mixed grill of chicken and beef skewers and lamb cutlets served with pita and a spicy muhammara dip, \u20ac18) and makdous salad (pickled baby aubergines stuffed with walnuts, red pepper and garlic, \u20ac5). An even warmer welcome awaited me at Sunshine, where I worked my way through a combination plate of Ethiopian dishes including kitfo (a dreamily succulent mix of raw beef and Ethiopian butter, \u20ac17) and gommen wot (kale with peppers, onions, garlic and chilli, \u20ac15). The charming and gregarious Andu, son of the owner, gave me a passionate mini seminar on the history and natural wonders of Ethiopia and even taught me a few words of his native language. Art and culture Top of anyone\u2019s cultural to-do list in Utrecht should be the wondrous Rietveld Schr\u00f6der House, a Unesco-protected semi-detached house designed by Gerrit Rietveld, architectural hero of the De Stijl art movement, founded in 1917. Tours of this design masterpiece run hourly (\u20ac17), with a guide to demonstrate various aspects of the house and an audio guide explaining the rest. It\u2019s a splendid example of De Stijl, with every room and piece of furniture showcasing the movement\u2019s core reliance on vertical and horizontal lines, primary colours and black and white. It\u2019s also ingenious, with movable walls upstairs that create rooms or open space as required, corner windows that open perpendicular to each other to create the feeling of being outside, and three-dimensional design to maximise the use of space. Another must \u2013 as long as climbing 465 narrow, winding steps doesn\u2019t faze you \u2013 is the Dom Tower, which still dominates the skyline of the city 637 years on from its completion. The 112-metre climb-cum-tour (\u20ac10) is mercifully broken up by stops on each floor to admire the tower\u2019s inner architecture as well as its 13 enormous bells (at 40 metres) and viewing galleries at 70 and 95 metres. The reward for making it to the top is an unmatched panorama of the city: on a clear day you can make out Rotterdam to the west and Amsterdam to the north. (The top is closed for restoration until 6 October 2019, but in the meantime you can still climb to 70 metres, and other rooms have been opened to visitors in compensation.) Exploring the Centraal Museum (\u20ac14) could fill a whole day \u2013 I had limited time and decided on Duran Lantink\u2019s Old Stock (running until 27 October), a thought-provoking protest against fast fashion, whose most striking aspect was a semi-destroyed recreation of a clothing store with the words \u201cNo spending that they did was done with measure\u201d spraypainted on the wall. Music, festivals and nightlife Although Amsterdam remains the centre of the Dutch music scene, Utrecht punches well above its weight in that regard, with a healthy array of local talent (the dream-pop band Amber Arcades and internationally acclaimed DJ Carista are notable natives) and venues that attract a constant stream of high-calibre international names. The top music-related reason to visit is undoubtedly Le Guess Who?, an annual four-day event that puts most other festivals in Europe to shame for both diversity and organisation (full pass \u20ac148, day tickets \u20ac43/\u20ac48). On the second weekend of each November it takes over the city with gigs celebrating \u201cglobal sounds and musical boundary-crossing\u201d in an array of venues including the thousand-year-old Janskerk church. The main hub of Le Guess Who? is TivoliVredenburg, a world-class, multi-space venue that hosts gigs of various sizes all year round. EKKO, De Helling and dB\u2019s are among a strong clutch of smaller venues that host rising domestic and international artists, many of whom \u201cgraduate\u201d to playing TivoliVredenburg further down the line. Things are getting going again now in Utrecht, but it is a student city and the gig and club schedules are light during the summer: some places, including WAS, close until the start of September, while the city\u2019s other high-quality club BASIS remains open but takes the action up a notch from September, with respected DJs and producers such as Shlomo and Mind Against appearing in 2019. Gardens and parks One of the purest pleasures in Utrecht is whiling away time in the city\u2019s many gorgeous parks and gardens. I found a couple of hours wandering through the wonderful Botanic Gardens (\u20ac8.50) deeply calming, while in the centre of town another horticultural gem is the Oude Hortus (\u20ac8), which has a cafe, century-old greenhouses and an orangery dating back to 1724. With its lake, fountains and sculptures, Wilhelminapark, to the south-east of the centre, is an obvious delight. I found the slight strangeness of Griftpark, which has been landscaped over a former rubbish dump and which I stumbled upon by chance during an after-dinner cycle, even more alluring. When I arrived near sunset an impromptu but high-quality gig was in progress by the canal. I lingered for a while and then walked over a bridge to find an even lovelier summer scene: a large group of young people practising rock\u2019n\u2019roll dancing on the top of a symmetrical grassy knoll, their graceful moves silhouetted against the last embers of daylight in the sky. \u2022 The trip was provided by Utrecht Marketing. Doubles at NH Centre Utrecht start at around \u00a3115 B&amp;B. Non-fly options include Eurostar to Amsterdam, then train to Utrecht.

Last December, 26-year-old Adam Hyde, a keen cricketer for St Ives and Warboys cricket club, did the same.</p> \n<p>Tim Drye, who replaced Pope as mayor in May 2018 \u2013 and whose son was a friend of Carl\u2019s \u2013 decided it was time to act. \u201cIt resonated with me,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d had mental health issues of my own at university. I said something in my speech about supporting a few existing charities and wanting to make St Ives a better place for mental health and to do something, not knowing what it would be. That phrase created a ripple that spread to others.\u201d</p> \n<p> Finch was one. A textbook trendy vicar, boyish, with tousled locks and a ready smile, Finch marked his 40th birthday by cycling from London to Paris for Calm, the <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/conversations-against-living-miserably/id1461758552\">Campaign against Living Miserably</a>. Wearing Calm\u2019s T-shirt initiated conversations that brought home just how many people struggle with mental health. \u201cIn all, 84 men under 45 take their lives every week in the UK \u2013 and no one talks about it,\u201d he says. \u201cIf this was affecting the baby-boomer generation, or retired people, we\u2019d be all over it.</p> \n<p>\u201cSo, Tim and I said: \u2018Let\u2019s try to make St Ives a Calm Town.\u2019 Around 50 people \u2013 including Carl\u2019s mum \u2013 came to our first meeting, which drew out people\u2019s details, interests, gifts and talents. We planned another and invited people to be part of a guiding team.\u201d</p> \n<p>That sparked a network of spontaneous activity, as Amanda Mumford, a hydrologist with a cheery smile and winningly self-deprecating manner, explains. \u201cI\u2019d been reading one of those books you pick up in Waterstones, written by the CEO of the Danish Institute for Happiness \u2013 there was a chapter about getting to know your neighbours, and building communities,\u201d she says. \u201cNot long before there was a lady on our street whose husband had died. I wanted to knock on her door, but wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d know what to say, which seemed a real shame.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5b03615cb1ee5b06edf9c6db38b73fa5ebe386b5\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b03615cb1ee5b06edf9c6db38b73fa5ebe386b5/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"couch\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The calm couch \u2013 a travelling, customised sofa taken to local events that has become a staple of a range of initiatives to improve mental health in St Ives, England,</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: St Ives calm town</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Inspired by the meeting, Mumford decided to get everyone together. \u201cSo, last Christmas, we took a drinks invitation to every house on our street \u2013 46 in all \u2013 just to pop in, low-key, on a Saturday for a mince pie. We thought: \u2018What\u2019s the worst that can happen? No one will come and we\u2019ll have a load of mince pies.\u2019 But people showed up \u2013 including many who have lived on the street for years, decades, and hadn\u2019t met each other. I think there\u2019s a lot of loneliness out there \u2013 and it can be easier to open up to people you don\u2019t know well.\u201d</p> \n<p>On a sultry night in late summer, the Calm Town team gather at Floods to discuss their push for the autumn. Monday is market day in St Ives. Under the stern gaze of Oliver Cromwell\u2019s statue in the market square \u2013 the erstwhile lord protector once lived here \u2013 local people go about their business. Once cattle and grain were traded by those going to St Ives. Now, against a backdrop of high street staples such as Wetherspoons and Greggs, they rummage among anything from Turkish towels to \u201cGraveside vases - \u00a32\u201d and boxes of batteries, cooking foil, coin holders and assorted frippery.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s still early days for Calm Town \u2013 the group admit they are finding their feet \u2013 but they are clearly energised and exercised by giving structure to their simple initiatives: group walks, coffee mornings and signposts to help.</p> \n<p>The junior section at Warboys cricket club now sport caps with the Calm Town logo; there are school tie-ins where seven-year-olds are pen pals with 97-year-olds. Discussions are going on about establishing the group as a charitable trust.</p> \n<p>The committee natter about <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CALMtown/\">their Facebook page</a>, whether a separate website is required, and where the \u201ccalm couch\u201d \u2013 a customised sofa taken to local events \u2013 is wanted next. It\u2019s all very English, very polite and, it has to be said, motivational.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf we can develop a culture in our town now that it\u2019s OK to talk \u2013 and my 12- and eight-year-old sons grow up realising that this is how you spot if your mate\u2019s struggling \u2013 that could be an amazing 10-year project,\u201d Finch enthuses. \u201cWe\u2019ll be a town that has a vocabulary around mental health when starting conversations is often the most difficult part.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat we\u2019re about is a movement for change \u2013 and I think any town, any village can do what we\u2019ve done. It\u2019s just saying: \u2018We care passionately about this.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Pope\u2019s next wishlist item is mental health first-aid training courses for local businesses, having been on one himself. \u201cI haven\u2019t had one person say no,\u201d he says. \u201cYou might sit in a hairdresser\u2019s chair for up to an hour \u2013 they\u2019re the kind of people who really are going to be able to tell where you\u2019re at.\u201d</p> \n<p>When I suggest to Drye that it\u2019s reminiscent of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/10/london-2012-olympic-games-makers\">Games Makers</a>, the volunteers who so enlivened the 2012 Olympics, he agrees wholeheartedly. \u201cAnd I was so cynical about that!\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut the wonderful thing is that it\u2019s triggered a lot of really creative people. I was back in my home town, Barnsley, the other day, thinking: \u2018How could you make that work here?\u2019</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"49558b92a6daefb5e7a683268c21f8ac7f42e6e4\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49558b92a6daefb5e7a683268c21f8ac7f42e6e4/0_200_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beech Drive BBQ\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clare Lorman-Hall at the Beech Drive BBQ in St Ives, Cambridgeshire.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Robertson/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cSt Ives is a very good place to live \u2013 a nice vibrant town with a good economy \u2013 you\u2019ve not got that there. Still, if it only encourages some people to give it a shot, and they make the place better than it was, that\u2019s a good enough place to be.\u201d</p> \n<p>Besides Mumford\u2019s \u201cmeet the street\u201d initiative \u2013 a forthcoming community barbecue has garnered several offers of help \u2013 there are calm walks, courtesy of yoga and pilates teacher Nicola Guitart, weekly 25-minute strolls from the top of the town with rallying points.</p> \n<p>Lisa Valla, head of Eastfield infant and nursery school, holds a monthly calm coffee morning for parents to come and chat. \u201cIf you just put \u2018free cake\u2019 and \u2018I promise we won\u2019t speak to you, you\u2019re just there to chat to each other\u2019, you get them in,\u201d she laughs. Designer and art gallery assistant Laura Bridgens feels planting the seed is as critical as the work itself, especially for a group who are, essentially, enthusiastic volunteers.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a danger of trying to do too much,\u201d she says. \u201cCalm cuppa, calm walk, meet the street, first-aiders \u2013 linking Calm Town to the school community, pointing people to links with teenage mental health \u2013 that\u2019s enough for now. If we clarify and crystallise the simple things we\u2019re trying to do and do them really well, then, hopefully, it should grow organically.\u201d</p> \n<p>Drye agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s a group of people who\u2019ve grasped the nettle and run with it,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of interest in trying to see how a ground-up approach to mental health might complement a strategy developed by somebody in the NHS to try to impose on the location.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s surprised me is how many different things are already in place, like the NHS 111 option 2, where you can ring up and talk to somebody \u2013 I\u2019d never heard of that. If all we end up doing is raising awareness of some of these professional groups, then that would be really good.\u201d (Editorial note: NHS 111 option 2 is only available in some regions).</p> \n<p>Mumford adds: \u201cBecause we\u2019re still relatively new, very amateur, we\u2019re still trying to work out exactly what Calm Town is \u2013 and what it isn\u2019t. But it\u2019s brought together people interested in making a difference. There aren\u2019t many of us and it\u2019s quite challenging, but it\u2019s got legs.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf you just make a little effort to do something, you can make a big difference \u2013 and helping people makes you feel good.</p> \n<p> \u201cWe want to inspire people to develop their own initiatives and do them in their own way, whatever works for them, rather than dictating what people should do, or doing it for them.\u201d</p> \n<p>The steering group winds up \u2013 monthly responsibilities and checklists are doled out, farewells are said. On the River Great Ouse that has flowed past the Grade II-listed Floods beer garden for centuries, a gull alights on the surface, creating a ripple illuminated by the rays of a brightly fading sun. All is calm.</p> \n<p><em>\u2022 </em>In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.

      "bodyText": "\u201cA minister, a pub landlord and a mayor \u2026 it sounds like the start of a really bad joke, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d The Rev Matt Finch laughs as he recalls the origins of a novel attempt to create a paragon of mental health in the small Cambridgeshire parish of St Ives. The three men \u2013 who walked not into a bar but a coffee shop \u2013 are trying to bring a smile back to the face of a community that has suffered its share of recent blows. As a collective, they hope their string of initiatives to reach people in their darkest hour could establish St Ives as a model town for others to emulate, in an age of growing mental discomfort. An old market town around 12 miles north-west of Cambridge \u2013 population 16,384, according to the 2011 census \u2013 St Ives is venerable enough to feature in the Domesday Book. Back then it was known as Slepe. There have been some rude awakenings of late. In April last year 28-year-old Carl Malik, a popular regular at Floods, the pub at which Phil Pope worked his way up from teenage glass collector to proprietor, took his own life; a loss compounded by the suicide of his father Kevin seven years earlier. Last December, 26-year-old Adam Hyde, a keen cricketer for St Ives and Warboys cricket club, did the same. Tim Drye, who replaced Pope as mayor in May 2018 \u2013 and whose son was a friend of Carl\u2019s \u2013 decided it was time to act. \u201cIt resonated with me,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d had mental health issues of my own at university. I said something in my speech about supporting a few existing charities and wanting to make St Ives a better place for mental health and to do something, not knowing what it would be. That phrase created a ripple that spread to others.\u201d Finch was one. A textbook trendy vicar, boyish, with tousled locks and a ready smile, Finch marked his 40th birthday by cycling from London to Paris for Calm, the Campaign against Living Miserably. Wearing Calm\u2019s T-shirt initiated conversations that brought home just how many people struggle with mental health. \u201cIn all, 84 men under 45 take their lives every week in the UK \u2013 and no one talks about it,\u201d he says. \u201cIf this was affecting the baby-boomer generation, or retired people, we\u2019d be all over it. \u201cSo, Tim and I said: \u2018Let\u2019s try to make St Ives a Calm Town.\u2019 Around 50 people \u2013 including Carl\u2019s mum \u2013 came to our first meeting, which drew out people\u2019s details, interests, gifts and talents. We planned another and invited people to be part of a guiding team.\u201d That sparked a network of spontaneous activity, as Amanda Mumford, a hydrologist with a cheery smile and winningly self-deprecating manner, explains. \u201cI\u2019d been reading one of those books you pick up in Waterstones, written by the CEO of the Danish Institute for Happiness \u2013 there was a chapter about getting to know your neighbours, and building communities,\u201d she says. \u201cNot long before there was a lady on our street whose husband had died. I wanted to knock on her door, but wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d know what to say, which seemed a real shame.\u201d Inspired by the meeting, Mumford decided to get everyone together. \u201cSo, last Christmas, we took a drinks invitation to every house on our street \u2013 46 in all \u2013 just to pop in, low-key, on a Saturday for a mince pie. We thought: \u2018What\u2019s the worst that can happen? No one will come and we\u2019ll have a load of mince pies.\u2019 But people showed up \u2013 including many who have lived on the street for years, decades, and hadn\u2019t met each other. I think there\u2019s a lot of loneliness out there \u2013 and it can be easier to open up to people you don\u2019t know well.\u201d On a sultry night in late summer, the Calm Town team gather at Floods to discuss their push for the autumn. Monday is market day in St Ives. Under the stern gaze of Oliver Cromwell\u2019s statue in the market square \u2013 the erstwhile lord protector once lived here \u2013 local people go about their business. Once cattle and grain were traded by those going to St Ives. Now, against a backdrop of high street staples such as Wetherspoons and Greggs, they rummage among anything from Turkish towels to \u201cGraveside vases - \u00a32\u201d and boxes of batteries, cooking foil, coin holders and assorted frippery. It\u2019s still early days for Calm Town \u2013 the group admit they are finding their feet \u2013 but they are clearly energised and exercised by giving structure to their simple initiatives: group walks, coffee mornings and signposts to help. The junior section at Warboys cricket club now sport caps with the Calm Town logo; there are school tie-ins where seven-year-olds are pen pals with 97-year-olds. Discussions are going on about establishing the group as a charitable trust. The committee natter about their Facebook page, whether a separate website is required, and where the \u201ccalm couch\u201d \u2013 a customised sofa taken to local events \u2013 is wanted next. It\u2019s all very English, very polite and, it has to be said, motivational. \u201cIf we can develop a culture in our town now that it\u2019s OK to talk \u2013 and my 12- and eight-year-old sons grow up realising that this is how you spot if your mate\u2019s struggling \u2013 that could be an amazing 10-year project,\u201d Finch enthuses. \u201cWe\u2019ll be a town that has a vocabulary around mental health when starting conversations is often the most difficult part. \u201cWhat we\u2019re about is a movement for change \u2013 and I think any town, any village can do what we\u2019ve done. It\u2019s just saying: \u2018We care passionately about this.\u2019\u201d Pope\u2019s next wishlist item is mental health first-aid training courses for local businesses, having been on one himself. \u201cI haven\u2019t had one person say no,\u201d he says. \u201cYou might sit in a hairdresser\u2019s chair for up to an hour \u2013 they\u2019re the kind of people who really are going to be able to tell where you\u2019re at.\u201d When I suggest to Drye that it\u2019s reminiscent of the Games Makers, the volunteers who so enlivened the 2012 Olympics, he agrees wholeheartedly. \u201cAnd I was so cynical about that!\u201d he says. \u201cBut the wonderful thing is that it\u2019s triggered a lot of really creative people. I was back in my home town, Barnsley, the other day, thinking: \u2018How could you make that work here?\u2019 \u201cSt Ives is a very good place to live \u2013 a nice vibrant town with a good economy \u2013 you\u2019ve not got that there. Still, if it only encourages some people to give it a shot, and they make the place better than it was, that\u2019s a good enough place to be.\u201d Besides Mumford\u2019s \u201cmeet the street\u201d initiative \u2013 a forthcoming community barbecue has garnered several offers of help \u2013 there are calm walks, courtesy of yoga and pilates teacher Nicola Guitart, weekly 25-minute strolls from the top of the town with rallying points. Lisa Valla, head of Eastfield infant and nursery school, holds a monthly calm coffee morning for parents to come and chat. \u201cIf you just put \u2018free cake\u2019 and \u2018I promise we won\u2019t speak to you, you\u2019re just there to chat to each other\u2019, you get them in,\u201d she laughs. Designer and art gallery assistant Laura Bridgens feels planting the seed is as critical as the work itself, especially for a group who are, essentially, enthusiastic volunteers. \u201cThere\u2019s a danger of trying to do too much,\u201d she says. \u201cCalm cuppa, calm walk, meet the street, first-aiders \u2013 linking Calm Town to the school community, pointing people to links with teenage mental health \u2013 that\u2019s enough for now. If we clarify and crystallise the simple things we\u2019re trying to do and do them really well, then, hopefully, it should grow organically.\u201d Drye agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s a group of people who\u2019ve grasped the nettle and run with it,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of interest in trying to see how a ground-up approach to mental health might complement a strategy developed by somebody in the NHS to try to impose on the location. \u201cWhat\u2019s surprised me is how many different things are already in place, like the NHS 111 option 2, where you can ring up and talk to somebody \u2013 I\u2019d never heard of that. If all we end up doing is raising awareness of some of these professional groups, then that would be really good.\u201d (Editorial note: NHS 111 option 2 is only available in some regions). Mumford adds: \u201cBecause we\u2019re still relatively new, very amateur, we\u2019re still trying to work out exactly what Calm Town is \u2013 and what it isn\u2019t. But it\u2019s brought together people interested in making a difference. There aren\u2019t many of us and it\u2019s quite challenging, but it\u2019s got legs. \u201cIf you just make a little effort to do something, you can make a big difference \u2013 and helping people makes you feel good. \u201cWe want to inspire people to develop their own initiatives and do them in their own way, whatever works for them, rather than dictating what people should do, or doing it for them.\u201d The steering group winds up \u2013 monthly responsibilities and checklists are doled out, farewells are said. On the River Great Ouse that has flowed past the Grade II-listed Floods beer garden for centuries, a gull alights on the surface, creating a ripple illuminated by the rays of a brightly fading sun. All is calm. \u2022 In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org. You can contact the mental health charity Mind by calling 0300 123 3393 or visiting mind.org.uk.

      "bodyText": "An art gallery has unveiled two new works in an attempt to address its gender imbalance, where less than 10% of its permanent collection are by women. The self-portraits by the Cape Town-based visual artist Berni Searle have been added to the permanent collection at Manchester Art Gallery, in a move to extend \u201cthe discourse around representation and identity\u201d. Untitled (Red) and In wake were donated by the art collector and philanthropist Valeria Napoleone, who only collects art by women, as part of a scheme to redress criticisms of a historical lack of female representation. In the joint initiative by Napoleone and the Contemporary Art Society, known as VNXXCAS, they will purchase and donate a significant work by a living female artist each year to a UK museum. In line with most of the UK\u2019s galleries, Manchester Art Gallery has relatively few works by female artists but many depicting women, especially nude. Many are created by men for male patrons. The society found that just 108 of Manchester Art Gallery\u2019s painting collection are by women in a permanent collection of 1,268, making the proportion of known female artists 8.5%. It believes the average proportion of known female artists in its member museums\u2019 collections about 10.8%. Napoleone said the two pieces of art not only \u201cilluminate themes of gender and identity but also, significantly, South Africa\u2019s anguished colonial past\u201d. The first piece explores racial classifications under apartheid South Africa, and the second was created after the 2012 Marikana massacre in which striking mineworkers were shot at close range by the South African police. Alistair Hudson, the director of Manchester Art Gallery, said: \u201cAs a civic institution, we can provide a platform to ask questions about power, representation and the role of public museums and galleries in the 21st century.\u201d Caroline Douglas, the director of Contemporary Art Society, said she was proud to donate the works by Searle, whom she described as one of South Africa\u2019s most influential artists. She said: \u201cThey will, without doubt, extend the discourse around representation and identity through their integration into the permanent collection.\u201d The Manchester unveiling is the third of its kind. The initiative has also taken place in Norwich and Leeds.",

But no \u2013 they\u2019re discussing the next album. And you think that John is the one who wanted to break them up but, when you hear this, he isn\u2019t. Doesn\u2019t that rewrite pretty much everything we thought we knew?\u201d</p> <p>Lewisohn turns the tape back on, and we hear John suggesting that each of them should bring in songs as candidates for the single.

      "bodyText": "The Beatles weren\u2019t a group much given to squabbling, says Mark Lewisohn, who probably knows more about them than they knew about themselves. But then he plays me the tape of a meeting held 50 years ago this month \u2013 on 8 September 1969 \u2013 containing a disagreement that sheds new light on their breakup. They\u2019ve wrapped up the recording of Abbey Road, which would turn out to be their last studio album, and are awaiting its release in two weeks\u2019 time. Ringo Starr is in hospital, undergoing tests for an intestinal complaint. In his absence, John Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison convene at Apple\u2019s HQ in Savile Row. John has brought a portable tape recorder. He puts it on the table, switches it on and says: \u201cRingo \u2013 you can\u2019t be here, but this is so you can hear what we\u2019re discussing.\u201d What they talk about is the plan to make another album \u2013 and perhaps a single for release in time for Christmas, a commercial strategy going back to the earliest days of Beatlemania. \u201cIt\u2019s a revelation,\u201d Lewisohn says. \u201cThe books have always told us that they knew Abbey Road was their last album and they wanted to go out on an artistic high. But no \u2013 they\u2019re discussing the next album. And you think that John is the one who wanted to break them up but, when you hear this, he isn\u2019t. Doesn\u2019t that rewrite pretty much everything we thought we knew?\u201d Lewisohn turns the tape back on, and we hear John suggesting that each of them should bring in songs as candidates for the single. He also proposes a new formula for assembling their next album: four songs apiece from Paul, George and himself, and two from Ringo \u2013 \u201cIf he wants them.\u201d John refers to \u201cthe Lennon-and-McCartney myth\u201d, clearly indicating that the authorship of their songs, hitherto presented to the public as a sacrosanct partnership, should at last be individually credited. Then Paul \u2013 sounding, shall we say, relaxed \u2013 responds to the news that George now has equal standing as a composer with John and himself by muttering something mildly provocative. \u201cI thought until this album that George\u2019s songs weren\u2019t that good,\u201d he says, which is a pretty double-edged compliment since the earlier compositions he\u2019s implicitly disparaging include Taxman and While My Guitar Gently Weeps. There\u2019s a nettled rejoinder from George: \u201cThat\u2019s a matter of taste. All down the line, people have liked my songs.\u201d John reacts by telling Paul that nobody else in the group \u201cdug\u201d his Maxwell\u2019s Silver Hammer, a song they\u2019ve just recorded for Abbey Road, and that it might be a good idea if he gave songs of that kind \u2013 which, John suggests, he probably didn\u2019t even dig himself \u2013 to outside artists in whom he had an interest, such as Mary Hopkin, the Welsh folk singer. \u201cI recorded it,\u201d a drowsy Paul says, \u201cbecause I liked it.\u201d A mapping of the tensions that would lead to the dissolution of the most famous and influential pop group in history is part of Hornsey Road, a teasingly titled stage show in which Lewisohn uses tape, film, photographs, new audio mixes of the music and his own matchless fund of anecdotes and memorabilia to tell the story of Abbey Road, that final burst of collective invention. The album is now so mythologised that the humdrum zebra crossing featured on its celebrated cover picture is now officially listed as site of special historic interest; a webcam is trained on it 24 hours a day, observing the comings and goings of fans from every corner of the world, infuriating passing motorists as these visitors pause to take selfies, often in groups of four, some going barefoot in imitation of Paul\u2019s enigmatic gesture that August morning in 1969. \u201cIt\u2019s a story of the people, the art, the people around them, the lives they were leading, and the break-up,\u201d Lewisohn says.

      "bodyText": "Labour activists are planning to put forward the most radical set of ideas ever proposed at party conference later this month as they try to shape the manifesto for an expected snap election. A four-day week, abolishing private schools and ambitious climate change targets are among the policy ideas campaigners hope will be adopted by the party when thousands of delegates meet in Brighton from 21 September. Young party members believe Corbyn has allowed radical ideas to flourish, beyond traditional areas preoccupying the left such as defending the NHS and welfare state. The leftwing grassroots group Momentum has announced it is backing a zero carbon target by 2030 as part of a Green New Deal agenda, which has been passed by around 90 constituency Labour parties so far and has backing from the Communication Workers Union. If passed the target will be Labour\u2019s most progressive green policy and among the most radical of any European political party. In the UK other political parties commit to net-zero by 2050. A Momentum source said: \u201cWith members putting forward exciting, radical policy like the Green New Deal just before an election, they\u2019re essentially writing the next manifesto. \u201cIt\u2019s a real chance for members to feed into policy, and it could well result in the most most ambitious, radical manifesto ever put forward by Labour.\u201d The conference is taking place the day after the youth climate strike and alongside a week of action by Extinction Rebellion, with activists pushing for the climate emergency to top the agenda on the conference floor. There was some relief among activists that the party conference would run to its full five days and had not been cut short because of an immediate election. Some policies have been in development for nearly a year. Banning private schools has support from six constituency parties so far and the backing of senior party figures, and is expected to be another key policy debated and voted on in Brighton. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell and former Labour leader Ed Miliband are both supporting the Labour Against Private Schools campaign group, which is running the AbolishEton hashtag on social media. The motion due to be brought to conference calls for the integration of state and private schools and the end of endowments of private schools. Teacher and campaigner Holly Rigby, said: \u201cThe thing about Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership of the Labour Party is it expanded what is possible again for the left. \u201cFor a long time we were just defending the limited rights of the welfare state, but then when Corbyn got elected people started think about what can we could do with the left in power. \u201cThis is why you\u2019re seeing loads of exciting political ideas like a four-day week and abolishing private schools becoming popular. It feels like there\u2019s no limit with how radical people want to go with it.\u201d Constituency Labour parties are allowed to back one motion at conference and the cut off date to list support is 12 September. Other motions include ending detention centres and setting up the \u201cinclusive ownership fund\u201d which was floated by McDonnell last year. A source said: \u201cThis is probably Labour\u2019s most radical policy to date. This is the wholesale transfer of assets of a large company to the worker.\u201d The four-day week with no loss of pay is also being backed by Momentum. British workers currently have the longest hours of any European country. If delegates pass motions they will be taken to the Clause V meeting of the National Executive Committee, shadow cabinet and trade unions where a manifesto is hammered out.",

      "body": "<p>Ben Feltwell is allergic to eggs. Which is why, on a trip to Amsterdam six years ago, he made absolutely sure there was no egg in the pastry he ordered at a French restaurant. \u201cI placed the order and told the waiter I was allergic,\u201d the 31-year-old digital marketer recalls. \u201cHe went off and checked with the kitchen. He spoke with the chef and came back and said it was OK. When the meal came out I said: \u2018Can you guarantee this doesn\u2019t have egg in it?\u2019 The waiter said: \u2018Of course!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Reassured, Feltwell bit into the pastry \u2013 and immediately had an allergic reaction. He can tell within seconds if a food item contains egg, because his lips begin to tingle.</p> <p>When the chef came out of the kitchen, he was on bellicose form. \u201cHe said: \u2018Well, we make the pastry with egg, but then we fry it and bake it, so there\u2019s no egg left!\u2019\u201d Feltwell took a taxi back to his hotel, where he spent the next four hours vomiting. To add insult to injury, after he left, the restaurant attempted to charge his companions for his meal.</p> <p>Feltwell laughs in disbelief as he remembers the incident. But it\u2019s not the first time his egg allergy hasn\u2019t been taken seriously, and it probably won\u2019t be the last. \u201cIt\u2019s treated as a dislike, rather than an allergy,\u201d he explains. \u201cI\u2019ve had a few chefs and waiters tell me to my face that it\u2019s not a real allergy, but a preference. I say: \u2018I think my doctor would beg to differ.\u2019\u201d And it\u2019s not just chefs that Feltwell needs to watch out for. Once, on a camping holiday, a companion slipped an egg into his curry. \u201cHe was trying to make the point that my egg allergy wasn\u2019t real.\u201d He sighs. \u201cIt ruined the holiday.\u201d</p> <p>For those with food allergies and intolerances, Feltwell\u2019s experiences may seem familiar. In August, a woman wrote to the Cut website\u2019s advice columnist, Heather Havrilesky, <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2019/08/ask-polly-my-in-laws-are-careless-about-my-food-allergy.html\" title=\"\">asking how to deal with in-laws </a>who put mushrooms in her food, even though she was severely allergic to them. Her in-laws weren\u2019t just callously disregarding her allergy \u2013 they seemed actively set on harming her, even slipping mushroom powder into the mashed potatoes during a family meal. \u201cWhat\u2019s worse is my husband told me that mushrooms were not a common dish served by his parents before he started dating me.\u201d</p> <p>Ignoring allergies can kill. In July 2016, 15-year-old Natasha Ednan-Laperouse <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/sep/29/pret-allergy-death-parents-demand-label-laws\" title=\"\">died on a British Airways flight </a>after suffering an allergic reaction to a Pret a Manger baguette she had bought at Heathrow airport. She hadn\u2019t realised the baguette contained sesame, to which she was severely allergic, because outlets that make food on-site aren\u2019t required to put allergen advice on their wrappers. There have been other deaths in recent years, including that of 15-year-old Megan Lee, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/04/teenager-who-died-after-eating-takeaway-was-unlawfully-killed\" title=\"\">died after eating a takeaway meal containing peanuts</a> in 2016 (the takeaway\u2019s owner and manager were convicted of manslaughter). And <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7440115/Bryon-burger-chain-fire-death-boy-wheat-dairy-allergy.html\" title=\"\">an inquest is </a><a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7440115/Bryon-burger-chain-fire-death-boy-wheat-dairy-allergy.html\" title=\"\">considering</a> whether 18-year-old Owen Carey, who died in his girlfriend\u2019s arms following an allergic reaction in April 2017, was served a meal contaminated with wheat and dairy \u2013 to which he had allergies \u2013 at a London burger bar.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are realising that those with food allergies can die on your premises,\u201d says Leigh George of the charity Allergy UK. She welcomes the introduction of Natasha\u2019s law, to be implemented in 2021, which will require food businesses <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/oct/23/pret-allergy-death-parents-to-meet-gove-over-food-labelling\" title=\"\">to publish allergen</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/oct/23/pret-allergy-death-parents-to-meet-gove-over-food-labelling\" title=\"\"> advice</a> on all pre-packaged food. But George urges the government to go a step further and require catering outlets to list every ingredient on their menus, not just the main allergens, so consumers can make informed choices.</p> <p>As a nation, we\u2019re becoming more allergic to the food we eat. According to the Food Standards Agency, in the UK an estimated 2 million people have a food allergy, with an average of 10 food-allergy-related deaths a year. <a href=\"https://www.anaphylaxis.org.uk/2016/10/11/latest-data-hscic-shows-notable-increases-number-hospital-admissions-allergies-anaphylaxis-across-englan/\" title=\"\">The NHS says</a> that allergy-related hospital admissions increased by 33% between 2011-12 and 2015-16. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.allergyuk.org/about/latest-news/882-allergy-uk-launches-weaning-information-for-parents\" title=\"\">Allergy UK reports</a> that <a href=\"http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/POST-PN-467/POST-PN-467.pdf\" title=\"\">between 6% and 8% of children</a> have some form of food allergy. \u201cThe diversity of our diet is one of the drivers of this rise in allergies,\u201d says Dr Isabel Skypala, a consultant allergy dietitian \u201cas people are becoming allergic to food they haven\u2019t eaten before \u2013 like jackfruit.\u201d</p> <p>Even if you don\u2019t have a life-threatening allergy, having someone disregard your dietary needs can have serious health consequences. Sebastian Clark, 25, a graphic designer from London, was diagnosed with the autoimmune disorder coeliac disease when he was 19. Eating even a trace of gluten will make him extremely ill. \u201cEvery time I eat gluten, I lose half a stone in weight.\u201d Despite this, family and friends don\u2019t always prepare his food with due care \u2013 Clark tells me about one meal at a relative\u2019s house where she slow-cooked a joint of beef. \u201cI said: \u2018This tastes really nice, it\u2019s so rich in flavour.\u2019 And she said: \u2018I put some craft ale in it.\u2019\u201d (Most beer contains gluten.) It took him three weeks to recover from that meal.</p> <p>Clark isn\u2019t the only person to struggle with family members. For Cathy Jones, a clerical officer, meals at her boyfriend\u2019s mother\u2019s house are always fraught with risk because she refuses to accept that Jones\u2019s irritable bowel syndrome \u2013 which is triggered by onions, spring onions and shallots \u2013 isn\u2019t make-believe, and keeps slipping alliums into her food. This year, the mother served Jones a sweet chilli dish \u2013 and made a point of telling her that the recipe had called for spring onions, but that she had left them out. But when they sat down to eat, the dish seemed to have chunks of onion in it. After peering suspiciously at her food, Jones asked the hostess outright \u2013 and was assured that it was only a piece of ginger. But it still looked remarkably onion-like, so her boyfriend tried a bite.</p> <p>\u201cHe said, \u2018Mum, this tastes like a shallot,\u2019\u201d Jones laughs. \u201cShe said: \u2018OK \u2013 you\u2019ve caught me!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Jones is remarkably good-humoured about it \u2013 she jokes that she will marry her boyfriend only when his mother accepts she can\u2019t eat onions. But the bit that really winds her up is that the mother doesn\u2019t eat onions herself. \u201cThey give her heartburn! She avoids them as well.\u201d</p> <p>The drive home from the mother\u2019s house takes nearly two hours. If Jones unwittingly eats onion before she gets into the car, it\u2019s not pretty. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to make an emergency stop somewhere. Luckily, that hasn\u2019t happened in years.\u201d</p> <p>What makes someone repeatedly ignore someone\u2019s dietary needs, to the extent of compromising their health? Jones doesn\u2019t believe it\u2019s malicious: \u201cI think she thinks I don\u2019t like the taste, so if she makes it taste better, I\u2019ll like it.\u201d But it\u2019s also possible that the increasing popularity of influencer-driven elimination diets has made it harder for people with legitimate medical needs to be taken seriously.</p> <p>This, after all, is an age where Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s Goop <a href=\"https://goop.com/wellness/detox/detox-2019-new-year-detox/\" title=\"\">advocates an annual \u201cdetox\u201d</a> that cuts out caffeine, alcohol, dairy, gluten, corn, nightshades, soy, refined sugar, shellfish, white rice and eggs; when supermodel <a href=\"https://www.getthegloss.com/article/elle-macpherson-why-i-eat-alkaline\" title=\"\">Elle Macpherson endorses the alkaline diet</a>; and when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/aug/11/why-we-fell-for-clean-eating\" title=\"\">\u201cclean-eating\u201d gurus</a> such as Madeleine Shaw and Amelia Freer secure lucrative publishing deals. Free-from regimes are sold as the cure to all of life\u2019s ills, boosted by a swarm of quasi-reputable nutritionists, often on beautifully photographed blogs.</p> <p>Tanya Khan, 21, a student from Warwick who is lactose-, egg- and gluten-intolerant, gets frustrated when her dietary requirements are viewed as a lifestyle choice. \u201cYou can\u2019t put someone\u2019s health condition on a par with veganism,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair. If they ate meat, something physically wouldn\u2019t happen to them \u2013 but if I had ice-cream, I would be really ill.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, food outlets that treat terms such as \u201cgluten-free\u201d as little more than buzzwords gamble with people\u2019s health. Chloe Marvin, 23, a civil servant from London, is intolerant to gluten, and allergic to nuts, beans and sesame. She recently got into a row with a food-truck worker, after she saw him put breaded ham into her \u201cgluten-free\u201d crepe. \u201cI said: \u2018You\u2019ve advertised it as a gluten-free crepe; I can\u2019t eat gluten.\u2019 He said: \u2018Well, the crepe is gluten-free; this is how ham comes.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Nathalie Newman has seen the damaging effects of influencer-driven fad diets first-hand. The 38-year-old, from Buckinghamshire, runs the popular blog <a href=\"https://www.intolerantgourmand.com/\" title=\"\">the Intolerant Gourmand</a>, which she founded after her son Callum was diagnosed with 28 allergies, eight of which are life-threatening. Newman works with chefs to make their menus allergy-safe. \u201cThey tell me that patrons come in and say they\u2019re dairy-free or gluten-free, or even coeliacs, so they take it seriously, and then a dessert will go past and they\u2019ll say: \u2018Oh, that looks amazing.\u2019 The chef says: \u2018You can\u2019t eat that,\u2019 and they\u2019ll go: \u2018Oh, it\u2019s OK \u2013 a little bit won\u2019t hurt.\u2019 So when someone who has a true allergy comes in and says: \u2018I can\u2019t eat that,\u2019 who do they trust and believe?\u201d Newman is convinced this behaviour puts people at risk. \u201cIt\u2019s quite scary.\u201d</p> <p>When restaurant staff conflate genuine allergy sufferers with fussy eaters, patrons with legitimate health conditions find themselves under scrutiny. Jenny Allen, 35, a teacher from Oldham, follows a gluten-free diet to mitigate the symptoms of <a href=\"https://lifelovesandlearning.blog/2018/09/11/postpartum-thyroiditis/\" title=\"\">her postpartum thyroiditis</a>. (Some believe that autoimmune conditions such as thyroiditis can be managed with the help of a gluten-free diet, although the scientific evidence is not conclusive. Allen herself believes that avoiding gluten has helped.) Recently, she was in a cafe and asked for a gluten-free meal. \u201cThey said: \u2018Oh, it\u2019s all the rage at the minute, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s a trendy thing to do.\u201d The comment made her feel \u201csilly and ridiculous\u201d. In particular, Allen chafed at having to justify herself to a perfect stranger. \u201cHaving to explain something really complex over a baguette,\u201d Allen sighs. \u201cI\u2019m like: I flipping loved bread before! I\u2019d rather be sitting here eating a crunchy baguette, and not having to explain my backstory.\u201d</p> <p>If restaurant staff aren\u2019t properly trained, supposedly allergen-free meals can easily be contaminated. Feltwell was made sick at an Italian restaurant that prepared his food on the same work surface as a florentine pizza, which has egg on it. Marvin had to run out of a south London restaurant recently after going into a sesame-induced anaphylactic shock from a shakshuka dish. She chose not to complain, even though she had disclosed her sesame allergy when ordering. \u201cMy friend said: \u2018Do you want to say anything? I said: \u2018No, not really.\u2019 It makes me really uncomfortable. Having an argument in a restaurant is unpleasant and draining.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not only restaurant staff you need to worry about \u2013 Khan has grown used to being accidentally poisoned at home. \u201cI get lactose-free butter and other people use it and you end up with breadcrumbs in there,\u201d she sighs.</p> <p>When you have specific dietary needs, eating out can feel like an ordeal. \u201cIt creates so much anxiety ... there\u2019s always a huge buildup to food,\u201d says Marvin. She tends to patronise places she has eaten at before, and knows to be safe. \u201cEveryone else can say: \u2018This looks like a nice place,\u2019 and wander in there. But that gives me the fear. For me, eating out is a huge thing. The evening before, I need to research the restaurant, and check their allergy menu. And even when I\u2019m out, I feel anxious beforehand and anxious when I\u2019m eating. Your trust has been broken by all these bad experiences.\u201d</p> <p>Some people don\u2019t think the risk is worth it \u2013 such as Mike Dancer, 53, a retired teacher from Reigate, Surrey, who follows a ketogenic diet to manage his epilepsy. (These low-carbohydrate, high-fat, controlled-protein regimes <a href=\"https://www.epilepsy.com/learn/treating-seizures-and-epilepsy/dietary-therapies/ketogenic-diet\" title=\"\">are proven</a> to help control seizures in some people.) \u201cI tend to travel with Tupperware boxes full of food,\u201d Dancer says. Once, at an international conference in Italy, he was unable to eat any of the food provided \u2013 so he simply didn\u2019t eat for five days.</p> <p>Having specific dietary needs is often socially isolating. \u201cIt can rule your life,\u201d says George. \u201cWhere the majority of us take it for granted that it\u2019s our birthday, or a Friday night, and we can go out for dinner, imagine how you\u2019d feel if you thought that eating that meal could kill you. It makes socialising extremely difficult and stressful.\u201d</p> <p>On work trips, Marvin tends to eat separately from her colleagues, in restaurants she knows to be safe.</p> <p>Life is so much easier when everyone respects your needs. After years of carrying his lunch around with him, Dancer was recently able to enjoy a meal of barbecued fish, avocado and salad with friends at Rockfish in Brixham, Devon. \u201cIt was a very inclusive feeling, to be honest. To be part of the group that\u2019s eating is very important. I felt at long last that I was allowed back with the group.\u201d</p> <p><em>Some names have been changed.</em> </p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 11 September 2019 because an earlier version referred to Stansted airport, when Heathrow was meant.

      "bodyText": "Ben Feltwell is allergic to eggs. Which is why, on a trip to Amsterdam six years ago, he made absolutely sure there was no egg in the pastry he ordered at a French restaurant. \u201cI placed the order and told the waiter I was allergic,\u201d the 31-year-old digital marketer recalls. \u201cHe went off and checked with the kitchen. He spoke with the chef and came back and said it was OK. When the meal came out I said: \u2018Can you guarantee this doesn\u2019t have egg in it?\u2019 The waiter said: \u2018Of course!\u2019\u201d Reassured, Feltwell bit into the pastry \u2013 and immediately had an allergic reaction. He can tell within seconds if a food item contains egg, because his lips begin to tingle. When the chef came out of the kitchen, he was on bellicose form. \u201cHe said: \u2018Well, we make the pastry with egg, but then we fry it and bake it, so there\u2019s no egg left!\u2019\u201d Feltwell took a taxi back to his hotel, where he spent the next four hours vomiting. To add insult to injury, after he left, the restaurant attempted to charge his companions for his meal. Feltwell laughs in disbelief as he remembers the incident. But it\u2019s not the first time his egg allergy hasn\u2019t been taken seriously, and it probably won\u2019t be the last. \u201cIt\u2019s treated as a dislike, rather than an allergy,\u201d he explains. \u201cI\u2019ve had a few chefs and waiters tell me to my face that it\u2019s not a real allergy, but a preference. I say: \u2018I think my doctor would beg to differ.\u2019\u201d And it\u2019s not just chefs that Feltwell needs to watch out for. Once, on a camping holiday, a companion slipped an egg into his curry. \u201cHe was trying to make the point that my egg allergy wasn\u2019t real.\u201d He sighs. \u201cIt ruined the holiday.\u201d For those with food allergies and intolerances, Feltwell\u2019s experiences may seem familiar. In August, a woman wrote to the Cut website\u2019s advice columnist, Heather Havrilesky, asking how to deal with in-laws who put mushrooms in her food, even though she was severely allergic to them. Her in-laws weren\u2019t just callously disregarding her allergy \u2013 they seemed actively set on harming her, even slipping mushroom powder into the mashed potatoes during a family meal. \u201cWhat\u2019s worse is my husband told me that mushrooms were not a common dish served by his parents before he started dating me.\u201d Ignoring allergies can kill. In July 2016, 15-year-old Natasha Ednan-Laperouse died on a British Airways flight after suffering an allergic reaction to a Pret a Manger baguette she had bought at Heathrow airport. She hadn\u2019t realised the baguette contained sesame, to which she was severely allergic, because outlets that make food on-site aren\u2019t required to put allergen advice on their wrappers. There have been other deaths in recent years, including that of 15-year-old Megan Lee, who died after eating a takeaway meal containing peanuts in 2016 (the takeaway\u2019s owner and manager were convicted of manslaughter). And an inquest is considering whether 18-year-old Owen Carey, who died in his girlfriend\u2019s arms following an allergic reaction in April 2017, was served a meal contaminated with wheat and dairy \u2013 to which he had allergies \u2013 at a London burger bar. \u201cPeople are realising that those with food allergies can die on your premises,\u201d says Leigh George of the charity Allergy UK. She welcomes the introduction of Natasha\u2019s law, to be implemented in 2021, which will require food businesses to publish allergen advice on all pre-packaged food. But George urges the government to go a step further and require catering outlets to list every ingredient on their menus, not just the main allergens, so consumers can make informed choices. As a nation, we\u2019re becoming more allergic to the food we eat. According to the Food Standards Agency, in the UK an estimated 2 million people have a food allergy, with an average of 10 food-allergy-related deaths a year. The NHS says that allergy-related hospital admissions increased by 33% between 2011-12 and 2015-16. Meanwhile, Allergy UK reports that between 6% and 8% of children have some form of food allergy. \u201cThe diversity of our diet is one of the drivers of this rise in allergies,\u201d says Dr Isabel Skypala, a consultant allergy dietitian \u201cas people are becoming allergic to food they haven\u2019t eaten before \u2013 like jackfruit.\u201d Even if you don\u2019t have a life-threatening allergy, having someone disregard your dietary needs can have serious health consequences. Sebastian Clark, 25, a graphic designer from London, was diagnosed with the autoimmune disorder coeliac disease when he was 19. Eating even a trace of gluten will make him extremely ill. \u201cEvery time I eat gluten, I lose half a stone in weight.\u201d Despite this, family and friends don\u2019t always prepare his food with due care \u2013 Clark tells me about one meal at a relative\u2019s house where she slow-cooked a joint of beef. \u201cI said: \u2018This tastes really nice, it\u2019s so rich in flavour.\u2019 And she said: \u2018I put some craft ale in it.\u2019\u201d (Most beer contains gluten.) It took him three weeks to recover from that meal. Clark isn\u2019t the only person to struggle with family members. For Cathy Jones, a clerical officer, meals at her boyfriend\u2019s mother\u2019s house are always fraught with risk because she refuses to accept that Jones\u2019s irritable bowel syndrome \u2013 which is triggered by onions, spring onions and shallots \u2013 isn\u2019t make-believe, and keeps slipping alliums into her food. This year, the mother served Jones a sweet chilli dish \u2013 and made a point of telling her that the recipe had called for spring onions, but that she had left them out. But when they sat down to eat, the dish seemed to have chunks of onion in it. After peering suspiciously at her food, Jones asked the hostess outright \u2013 and was assured that it was only a piece of ginger. But it still looked remarkably onion-like, so her boyfriend tried a bite. \u201cHe said, \u2018Mum, this tastes like a shallot,\u2019\u201d Jones laughs. \u201cShe said: \u2018OK \u2013 you\u2019ve caught me!\u2019\u201d Jones is remarkably good-humoured about it \u2013 she jokes that she will marry her boyfriend only when his mother accepts she can\u2019t eat onions. But the bit that really winds her up is that the mother doesn\u2019t eat onions herself. \u201cThey give her heartburn! She avoids them as well.\u201d The drive home from the mother\u2019s house takes nearly two hours. If Jones unwittingly eats onion before she gets into the car, it\u2019s not pretty. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to make an emergency stop somewhere. Luckily, that hasn\u2019t happened in years.\u201d What makes someone repeatedly ignore someone\u2019s dietary needs, to the extent of compromising their health? Jones doesn\u2019t believe it\u2019s malicious: \u201cI think she thinks I don\u2019t like the taste, so if she makes it taste better, I\u2019ll like it.\u201d But it\u2019s also possible that the increasing popularity of influencer-driven elimination diets has made it harder for people with legitimate medical needs to be taken seriously. This, after all, is an age where Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s Goop advocates an annual \u201cdetox\u201d that cuts out caffeine, alcohol, dairy, gluten, corn, nightshades, soy, refined sugar, shellfish, white rice and eggs; when supermodel Elle Macpherson endorses the alkaline diet; and when \u201cclean-eating\u201d gurus such as Madeleine Shaw and Amelia Freer secure lucrative publishing deals. Free-from regimes are sold as the cure to all of life\u2019s ills, boosted by a swarm of quasi-reputable nutritionists, often on beautifully photographed blogs. Tanya Khan, 21, a student from Warwick who is lactose-, egg- and gluten-intolerant, gets frustrated when her dietary requirements are viewed as a lifestyle choice. \u201cYou can\u2019t put someone\u2019s health condition on a par with veganism,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair. If they ate meat, something physically wouldn\u2019t happen to them \u2013 but if I had ice-cream, I would be really ill.\u201d Meanwhile, food outlets that treat terms such as \u201cgluten-free\u201d as little more than buzzwords gamble with people\u2019s health. Chloe Marvin, 23, a civil servant from London, is intolerant to gluten, and allergic to nuts, beans and sesame. She recently got into a row with a food-truck worker, after she saw him put breaded ham into her \u201cgluten-free\u201d crepe. \u201cI said: \u2018You\u2019ve advertised it as a gluten-free crepe; I can\u2019t eat gluten.\u2019 He said: \u2018Well, the crepe is gluten-free; this is how ham comes.\u2019\u201d Nathalie Newman has seen the damaging effects of influencer-driven fad diets first-hand. The 38-year-old, from Buckinghamshire, runs the popular blog the Intolerant Gourmand, which she founded after her son Callum was diagnosed with 28 allergies, eight of which are life-threatening. Newman works with chefs to make their menus allergy-safe. \u201cThey tell me that patrons come in and say they\u2019re dairy-free or gluten-free, or even coeliacs, so they take it seriously, and then a dessert will go past and they\u2019ll say: \u2018Oh, that looks amazing.\u2019 The chef says: \u2018You can\u2019t eat that,\u2019 and they\u2019ll go: \u2018Oh, it\u2019s OK \u2013 a little bit won\u2019t hurt.\u2019 So when someone who has a true allergy comes in and says: \u2018I can\u2019t eat that,\u2019 who do they trust and believe?\u201d Newman is convinced this behaviour puts people at risk. \u201cIt\u2019s quite scary.\u201d When restaurant staff conflate genuine allergy sufferers with fussy eaters, patrons with legitimate health conditions find themselves under scrutiny. Jenny Allen, 35, a teacher from Oldham, follows a gluten-free diet to mitigate the symptoms of her postpartum thyroiditis. (Some believe that autoimmune conditions such as thyroiditis can be managed with the help of a gluten-free diet, although the scientific evidence is not conclusive. Allen herself believes that avoiding gluten has helped.) Recently, she was in a cafe and asked for a gluten-free meal. \u201cThey said: \u2018Oh, it\u2019s all the rage at the minute, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s a trendy thing to do.\u201d The comment made her feel \u201csilly and ridiculous\u201d. In particular, Allen chafed at having to justify herself to a perfect stranger. \u201cHaving to explain something really complex over a baguette,\u201d Allen sighs. \u201cI\u2019m like: I flipping loved bread before! I\u2019d rather be sitting here eating a crunchy baguette, and not having to explain my backstory.\u201d If restaurant staff aren\u2019t properly trained, supposedly allergen-free meals can easily be contaminated. Feltwell was made sick at an Italian restaurant that prepared his food on the same work surface as a florentine pizza, which has egg on it. Marvin had to run out of a south London restaurant recently after going into a sesame-induced anaphylactic shock from a shakshuka dish. She chose not to complain, even though she had disclosed her sesame allergy when ordering. \u201cMy friend said: \u2018Do you want to say anything? I said: \u2018No, not really.\u2019 It makes me really uncomfortable. Having an argument in a restaurant is unpleasant and draining.\u201d It\u2019s not only restaurant staff you need to worry about \u2013 Khan has grown used to being accidentally poisoned at home. \u201cI get lactose-free butter and other people use it and you end up with breadcrumbs in there,\u201d she sighs. When you have specific dietary needs, eating out can feel like an ordeal. \u201cIt creates so much anxiety ... there\u2019s always a huge buildup to food,\u201d says Marvin. She tends to patronise places she has eaten at before, and knows to be safe. \u201cEveryone else can say: \u2018This looks like a nice place,\u2019 and wander in there. But that gives me the fear. For me, eating out is a huge thing. The evening before, I need to research the restaurant, and check their allergy menu. And even when I\u2019m out, I feel anxious beforehand and anxious when I\u2019m eating. Your trust has been broken by all these bad experiences.\u201d Some people don\u2019t think the risk is worth it \u2013 such as Mike Dancer, 53, a retired teacher from Reigate, Surrey, who follows a ketogenic diet to manage his epilepsy. (These low-carbohydrate, high-fat, controlled-protein regimes are proven to help control seizures in some people.) \u201cI tend to travel with Tupperware boxes full of food,\u201d Dancer says. Once, at an international conference in Italy, he was unable to eat any of the food provided \u2013 so he simply didn\u2019t eat for five days. Having specific dietary needs is often socially isolating. \u201cIt can rule your life,\u201d says George. \u201cWhere the majority of us take it for granted that it\u2019s our birthday, or a Friday night, and we can go out for dinner, imagine how you\u2019d feel if you thought that eating that meal could kill you. It makes socialising extremely difficult and stressful.\u201d On work trips, Marvin tends to eat separately from her colleagues, in restaurants she knows to be safe. Life is so much easier when everyone respects your needs. After years of carrying his lunch around with him, Dancer was recently able to enjoy a meal of barbecued fish, avocado and salad with friends at Rockfish in Brixham, Devon. \u201cIt was a very inclusive feeling, to be honest. To be part of the group that\u2019s eating is very important. I felt at long last that I was allowed back with the group.\u201d Some names have been changed. \u2022 This article was amended on 11 September 2019 because an earlier version referred to Stansted airport, when Heathrow was meant.

      "bodyText": "Leaked communications suggest that the UN\u2019s migration agency is censoring itself on the climate crisis and the global compact on migration, following pressure from the US government. An email sent by a US-based official of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) on 28 August to colleagues around the world relayed that the US state department\u2019s Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration (PRM) told the agency documents related to programme activities it funds \u201cmust not be in conflict with current [US government] political sensitivities\u201d. Sensitivities include the climate crisis, sustainable development goals, the global compact for migration and \u201canything that seems at odds with the administration\u2019s take on US domestic/foreign issues\u201d, the official wrote in the email. \u201cDocuments related to programme activities, especially those that will be published online, may require prior review and approval by the donor,\u201d they went on, requesting that colleagues use \u201cdiscretion\u201d and share relevant documents \u201cin enough time to make any necessary adjustments in coordination with PRM\u201d. The email\u2019s author noted that \u201cPRM is very willing to cut funding in areas that it deems are not in line with US foreign policy objectives\u201d, and asked that the substance of the email be conveyed by regional coordinators \u201cto all country focal points\u201d. The Guardian understands from IOM sources and further communications it has seen that the agency is avoiding direct references to climate change in documents for projects funded by other US government entities such as USAid. IOM receives about a quarter of its total budget of $2bn (\u00a31.6bn) from the US, $18m of which is provided by PRM. There is no indication that messaging on projects funded by other donors will be censored, or that there will be any operational impact on existing programmes. However, a source in the humanitarian community in the US who had recently left IOM, told the Guardian he was \u201cvery concerned \u2026 that IOM is acquiescing to this kind of pressure\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a response [to the email] from at least one regional official who explicitly asked staff not to directly refer to climate change or the global compact on migration in a range of reports or proposals that would be sent to the US government,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile I understand that IOM are simply doing what they think is strategically necessary to protect funding for important projects, senior officials should be mindful of the fact that there\u2019s a slippery slope here,\u201d he continued. Jeff Crisp, a research associate at Oxford University\u2019s Refugee Studies Centre who previously held a senior position in the UN\u2019s refugee agency UNHCR, said the leaked message \u201craises some serious questions about the autonomy of IOM, its sensitivity to positions adopted by the US administration, and its ability to function as a member of the UN system\u201d. Akshaya Kumar, director of crisis advocacy at Human Rights Watch, said: \u201cConfronting climate change may very well be the issue that defines our time. Agencies in the UN family shouldn\u2019t be towing the Trump party line.\u201d Tensions between the US and IOM have simmered over the past year, when Ken Isaacs, the proposed US candidate to head the agency, became the first American since the 1960s to be rejected as its top official, prompting concerns that funding from the state department could be cut. Press reports at the time revealed that Isaacs had made comments online expressing doubts over the evidence for climate change, suggesting it was a \u201choax\u201d. President Trump himself has expressed doubts about the effects and causes of climate change, while the US objected to the global compact on migration, describing it as a \u201cpro-migration\u201d agreement and an \u201ceffort by the United Nations to advance global governance at the expense of the sovereign right of states\u201d. Leonard Doyle, IOM\u2019s head of communications, said: \u201cIOM recognises and respects the priorities and limitations of its donors, including the US. We seek to ensure that staff are aware of such sensitivities when drafting funding proposals for activities which are a response to migration trends and which follow best practice.\u201d A US state department spokesperson said: \u201cIOM is an important partner for the United States around the globe. The US government supports organisations such as IOM, to conduct programmes and activities that are consistent with our foreign policy goals and objectives.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 11 September 2019. The International Organization for Migration is the UN\u2019s migration agency, not its refugee agency as an earlier version said.",

I\u2019m not saying that there isn\u2019t complexity of plot in Atwood\u2019s creation, but in Gilead there is also a great deal of moral certainty. There is good, and there is evil. There is oppression, and there is resistance.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/10/the-testaments-by-margaret-atwood-review\">The Testaments by Margaret Atwood review \u2013 a dazzling follow-up to The Handmaid\u2019s Tale</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The appearance of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/03/how-the-handmaids-tale-dressed-protests-across-the-world\" title=\"\">handmaids in their red cloaks</a> has put heart into me at various protests over the past couple of years. I have photographed them at women\u2019s marches in London and seen them gather in courtrooms in the US. Although they are a symbol of a possibly terrifying future, they are also a symbol of shared understanding, which gives me hope. And The Testaments, unlike The Handmaid\u2019s Tale itself, is a truly hopeful tale. It reassures us that we are right to fear our enemies and right to resist them, and it reassures us that totalitarianism can be seen off.</p> \n<p>This second novel provides even more of this hopefulness, because it is about the resistance to Gilead. We saw seeds of resistance in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, but they were constantly being smothered or ripped out. Here, we learn how they have taken root \u2013 including in some unexpected places. The Testaments is a more accessible novel than The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, sharing some of the tone of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/may/25/the-handmaids-tale-on-tv-too-disturbing-even-for-margaret-atwood\" title=\"\">spin-off television series</a>, which necessarily tended to replace introspection with action. These heroines are marvellously resourceful, almost superhuman in their bravery, able to live undercover for years, oversee underground networks, slip across borders, mastermind spy rings, manipulate colleagues, fell enemies with a blow.</p> \n<p>There is little, here, of the quotidian ordinariness of much political resistance, which can so often turn out to be disappointingly humdrum and compromised. It is massively satisfying to find this kind of heightened reality in fiction, to see the world in an exaggerated mode, the patterns standing out so much more clearly than in the one in which we live.</p> \n<p>Even though in these resonant books she creates such a stark political vision, it\u2019s intriguing that Atwood has nevertheless been keen to say that she is not writing a manifesto. She has often pushed back in interviews, when asked about her relationship to feminism, against <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/17/margaret-atwood-the-prophet-of-dystopia\" title=\"\">the idea that she will provide</a> \u201ca megaphone for any one particular set of beliefs\u201d. As <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/10/books/review/margaret-atwood-handmaids-tale-age-of-trump.html\" title=\"\">she wrote in the New York Times</a> in 2017: \u201cIs The Handmaid\u2019s Tale a \u2018feminist\u2019 novel? If you mean an ideological tract in which all women are angels and/or so victimized they are incapable of moral choice, no.\u201d</p> \n<p>It is hardly surprising that a writer of such inventive fiction would be nervous of the idea that her work could be pigeonholed into any ideological framework. There is a fear among many female writers and film-makers that to call your work feminist means to curtail its imaginative impact and suggest it should be read as propaganda. This is the same conception of feminist fiction that was so powerfully rejected by another great writer, the late <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/18/doris-lessing-five-best-novels\" title=\"\">Doris Lessing</a>, whose work was also often claimed for the feminist movement. In 1982 she trenchantly <a href=\"https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/99/01/10/specials/lessing-space.html\" title=\"\">told an interviewer</a>: \u201cWhat the feminists want of me is something they haven\u2019t examined because it comes from religion. They want me to bear witness. What they would really like me to say is, \u2018Ha, sisters, I stand with you side by side in your struggle toward the golden dawn where all those beastly men are no more.\u2019 Do they really want people to make oversimplified statements about men and women? In fact, they do.\u201d</p> \n<p>Eighteen years ago I had a little exchange with Lessing about her view of feminism. She wrote to me to clarify reports of comments she had made about men and women, but also to double down on her disappointment with the women\u2019s movement, which she said expended too much of its \u201cwonderful energy\u201d in rubbishing men. In my response, I conceded that I should probably stop calling her a feminist. \u201cPerhaps I am wrong to call you a feminist,\u201d I wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s silly to stick a label on you that you wouldn\u2019t choose yourself.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"60c36447-6d70-4d73-9e44-0886bea51414\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3Idw6LY4AGM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>I had forgotten about that exchange over the years, but was recently reminded of it by the University of East Anglia, where the letters will be going on display in a new exhibition (<a href=\"http://dorislessing100.org/\" title=\"\">Doris Lessing 100</a>, which is opening this week).</p> \n<p>But when I reread these letters, I realised that despite my concession in 2001, I still see Lessing\u2019s fiction as deeply feminist. Because whenever I dip back into Lessing\u2019s work, particularly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/apr/06/the-golden-notebook-50-years-on\" title=\"\">The Golden Notebook</a>, the Children of Violence series or her memoirs, I cannot but remember how important she was to the growth of my and other women\u2019s feminism. Without Anna Wulf or Martha Quest and their fiercely uncompromising relationships with their own bodies and their partners, it\u2019s almost impossible to imagine the kind of wry, honest, explicit fiction by women we now take for granted. These heroines killed off the \u201c<a href=\"http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/english/melani/novel_19c/thackeray/angel.html\" title=\"\">Angel in the House</a>\u201d that Virginia Woolf complained about, and revealed women in their full, often dislikable, but utterly mesmerising humanity.</p> \n<p>Lessing\u2019s heroines are too complicated to be easily understood, and they struggle to understand themselves. Their sexual and family relationships are messy and challenging, and their political activity provides no easy journey either, but is fraught and compromised. And that lack of clarity, in itself, is feminist.</p> \n<p>Because feminism is partly just about finding ways to express women\u2019s full humanity and refusing to accept frames that may flatten our experiences. Feminist fiction is not just about making our political world clearer and simpler. It is not just about providing us with reassurance that we are on the side of the good. We see that complexity time and again in Atwood\u2019s fiction too, even if the popular conception of Gilead, especially the way it has been disseminated through political protest and the television series, has often flattened it out for us. The television series in particular sometimes began to feel as if it was trying to bludgeon us with its lessons about the violence of misogynist oppression.</p> \n<p>And Atwood too sees her work as feminist in this way. She <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/10/books/review/margaret-atwood-handmaids-tale-age-of-trump.html\" title=\"\">went on to write</a> about whether The Handmaid\u2019s Tale was feminist: \u201cIf you mean a novel in which women are human beings \u2013 with all the variety of character and behavior that implies \u2013 and are also interesting and important, and what happens to them is crucial to the theme, structure and plot of the book, then yes.\u201d</p> \n<p>Then, yes. This is the view of feminist fiction that is most valuable. A political novel is not necessarily one that gives you a manifesto, but one that enables you to expand your political understanding of a messy and difficult world. Which is why I would say that there is at least one other important feminist novel on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/03/booker-prize-margaret-atwoods-the-handmaids-tale-sequel-makes-shortlist\" title=\"\">Booker shortlist</a> alongside Atwood\u2019s.

But by knitting together the lives of a diverse set of women, what it does do is explore the experiences and listen to the voices that we need to hear from \u2013 and often comes back with uncomfortable and urgent news. Some of her heroines succeed by compromise and some by resistance; some live out lies and some insist on the truth, some make their own narratives and some are overcome by others\u2019 needs. For this white reader, this kind of tapestry reminds us of how often black women\u2019s full humanity is skimmed over. This novel shifts our perspectives; it complicates our worldview.</p> \n<p>For me, the most vital political fiction is fiction that makes us feel the irreducible humanity of those who are constantly being forgotten. At a time when empathy often seems to be contracting, when political views admit less and less nuance, let\u2019s not be afraid of complexity. There are no easy answers in our real or imaginary worlds, and let\u2019s not pretend that there ever will be.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Natasha Walter is director of Women for Refugee Women and author of Living Dolls: The Return of Sexism</p>",

      "bodyText": "Children with special needs and disabilities are being marginalised by mainstream schools in England, according to a report by the National Audit Office (NAO) which says the system incentivises them to be less inclusive. The NAO accuses the government of misjudging the financial impact of its changes to education, with rising numbers of pupils with special needs unable to be accommodated in mainstream schools following a combination of funding strains, off-rolling and exclusions. This has resulted in local authorities having to break their budgets to fund additional places in special schools, including in more expensive independent schools, its report says. The investigation found that mainstream schools had incentives to avoid enrolling pupils with special educational needs and disabilities (Send), because of the additional costs imposed on school budgets and from the impact on the school\u2019s league tables. \u201cStakeholders in the sector have raised concerns that the demand for special school places is growing because the system incentivises mainstream primary and secondary schools to be less inclusive,\u201d the NAO said. \u201cMainstream schools are expected to cover the first \u00a36,000 of support for a child with Send from existing budgets and cost pressures can make them reluctant to admit or keep pupils with Send. \u201cAnother barrier is that schools with high numbers of children with Send may also appear to perform less well against performance metrics.\u201d The NAO\u2019s figures showed that while the number of pupils with high needs has risen over the past four years in special schools, alternative provision and independent special schools, the number enrolled in mainstreams schools was still lower in 2018 than in 2014 or 2015. A spokesperson for the Department for Education (DfE) said the government has committed to providing an extra \u00a3700m next year to help educate children with Send, along with launching a review of support. \u201cWe have improved special educational needs support to put families at the heart of the system and give them better choice in their children\u2019s education, whether in mainstream or special school,\u201d the DfE said. Gareth Davies, the head of the NAO, said: \u201cWhile lots of schools, both special and mainstream, are providing high-quality education for pupils with Send, it is clear that many children\u2019s needs are not being met. \u201cI therefore welcome the DfE\u2019s announcement of a review into support for children with Send, following our engagement with them on this issue over recent months. We hope the review will secure the improvements in quality and sustainability that are needed.\u201d The report noted that pupils with special needs were more likely to be permanently excluded than those without special needs. Pupils with Send accounted for nearly 45% of all permanent exclusions and 43% of fixed-term exclusions in 2017-18, despite accounting for only around 20% of the pupil population. \u201cEvidence also suggests that pupils with Send are more likely to experience off-rolling \u2013 where schools encourage parents to remove a child primarily for the school\u2019s benefit \u2013 than other pupils,\u201d the NAO wrote. The 2014 education reforms replaced statements of special education needs with education and health care (EHC) plans, but the NAO said the DfE misjudged the financial consequences: \u201cThe department expected that the benefits and savings would significantly outweigh the costs of moving to the new system.\u201d Tim Nicholls, head of policy at the National Autistic Society, said ministers need to use the review announced last week to address the system\u2019s serious problems. \u201cWe hear awful stories every day of autistic children who are being held back from getting the education they deserve because schools don\u2019t understand or can\u2019t meet their needs.

But there was no doubting the exception that stood apart from its fellows in 1882, and still did today. The oak tree that was just inside the farm gate had the spreading waistline of approaching middle age and the wrinkles and burrs to match; it nevertheless towered in its maturity, perhaps 30 metres or more. It was still a couple of centuries from shedding its antlers and morphing from a tree into a monolith. I walked over, patted its trunk and wished it a happy birthday, at least 150 years young. </p>",

And they plotted the trees. Every scattered tree in this meadow, all 31 of them, was faithfully and accurately represented by a miniature cloud on a stick. In its attention to detail, this single field illustrates one of the greatest mapmaking achievements of the pre-digital age \u2013 the 25 inch to a mile Ordnance Survey series. And over the course of a morning, a printout of the old map in hand, I found that snapshot of the past sharpening my images of the present. Though the supposedly oval pond was choked with lush rushes and crowded by hawthorn bushes that sucked its summers dry, I could now make out its quarter-moon curvature. For the first time in years of walking this undulating field, its dips and folds concealing and revealing, I stepped a few metres off the path towards the fence and discovered the spade-sliced sheer sides of a hollow, barely a metre deep at the front edge, that pinpointed the worked and abandoned sand pit. Thrilled with this find, I zigzagged around to check how many of the field\u2019s 31 trees had lasted. All but one of today\u2019s had the smooth shapeliness of youth, lacking the gnarled and crooked credentials of age. But there was no doubting the exception that stood apart from its fellows in 1882, and still did today. The oak tree that was just inside the farm gate had the spreading waistline of approaching middle age and the wrinkles and burrs to match; it nevertheless towered in its maturity, perhaps 30 metres or more. It was still a couple of centuries from shedding its antlers and morphing from a tree into a monolith. I walked over, patted its trunk and wished it a happy birthday, at least 150 years young.",

      "bodyText": "The Department of Agriculture is investigating a live export company after it received footage showing Australian cattle being pulled to the ground with ropes and slaughtered without being stunned in a carpark underneath an Indonesian mosque. International Livestock Exports has suspended all supply to one of its Indonesian abattoirs over the breach, which was reported to the department by Animals Australia. ILE identified itself as the exporter after the department shared the footage it received from Animals Australia with all relevant exporters, in an attempt to identify the cattle. The footage, seen by Guardian Australia, shows about a dozen cattle in an underground carpark near the grand mosque in Medan City in North Sumatra. They were killed as part of Eid al-Adha last month and a complaint was lodged with the department on 13 August. Four of the cattle were identified as Australian. The footage shows them being pulled to the ground by ropes around their legs and rope halters, then being dragged by their tails. The slaughter happened in full view, and sometimes within metres, of other cattle. Ear tags had been removed but a combination of ear notches and brands identified them as cattle produced on a station in the Northern Territory and shipped to Indonesia by ILE. The slaughter was reported to the department as a breach of the Exporter Supply Chain Assurance System (Escas), which was introduced after a 2011 Four Corners investigation. Exporters dealing in Australian animals can sell only into an approved supply chain. A director of ILE, Mike Stanton, told Guardian Australia the cattle had been illegally sold outside the supply chain from a facility in Indonesia, and ILE had suspended the facility it believed was responsible. \u201cWe did that as soon as we were able to work out where the leak has been,\u201d he said. The department told Guardian Australia it did not comment on investigations that were still in progress. Legislation to appoint an independent inspector general for live exports passed the Senate on Tuesday. Stanton said there were 140 facilities in Indonesia approved as part of ILE\u2019s supply chain. \u201cIf you\u2019re exporting a lot of cattle there\u2019s going to be issues along the line,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do do our best. \u201cI know a lot of people think we don\u2019t, but it\u2019s bloody hard.\u201d He said the treatment of the cattle shown in the footage, particularly the long minutes taken to drag them to the ground, was \u201cawful\u201d. \u201cWe are in the business of selling animals for slaughter but we want it done in an appropriate manner,\u201d he said. ILE shares an office in West Perth with Emanuel Exports, the company responsible for the 2017 voyage of the Awassi Express in which 2,400 sheep died of heat stress. An investigation by the department into allegations Animals Australia paid for the footage from the Awassi found no evidence to suggest the footage was manufactured or illegally obtained. ILE was issued a show-cause notice in October because of its association with Emanuel and another sister company, EMRS Rural Exports, which both had their export licences cancelled. ILE handles 70% of live cattle exports from Broome. The Australian Live Export Council chief executive, Mark Harvey-Sutton, said the slaughter was \u201cunacceptable\u201d but had to be put in context of the industry\u2019s broader track record. \u201cLet\u2019s not forget that exporters are also very proactive in this space and often actions are undertaken by exporters ahead of what the regulator looks to do, and that was the case this time,\u201d he said. Harvey-Sutton said Australian exporters had \u201cvery good systems in place\u201d and the council worked \u201cvery closely\u201d with both producers and exporters to keep them informed in cases of Escas non-compliance. There have been 172 complaints of non-compliance since Escas was established in 2012 \u2013 70 by Animals Australia. Its strategy director, Lyn White, said: \u201cIt is deeply concerning that Australian cattle have once again been subjected to roping slaughter in Indonesia, and that the only reason this has become known is because of the efforts of a charity. \u201cEscas was established to prevent such horrific treatment. The fact that it can still occur speaks to the ever-present risks of exporting animals and losing control of their welfare.\u201d White said Escas breaches should result in the automatic suspension of an export licence. A review conducted by Guardian Australia of the first five years of reports found only three cases in which punitive action was taken against exporters. Self-reported breaches by exporters are not publicly listed and investigated if they are made and rectified within a set timeline. The chief executive of the Northern Territory Cattlemen\u2019s Association, Ashley Manicaros, said the slaughter involved just four of the 400,000 cattle exported from Darwin to Indonesia each year. Manicaros said exporters should be given more credit for the work they had done to reform after the crackdown in the live sheep trade. \u201cThose operators that don\u2019t meet those standards will be the ones that have to get to the standard if they want to remain in business,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Benjamin Netanyahu has announced he will annex large swathes of occupied Palestinian territories if he is re-elected, a decision that for decades has been considered an endgame scenario for Palestinians\u2019 aspirations of statehood. The Israeli prime minister said on Tuesday that he planned to make the move, which would permanently seize up to one-third of the West Bank, after the election next week and hinted it may have been approved by Washington. \u201cI am waiting to do this in maximum coordination with [Donald] Trump,\u201d he said in a speech broadcast live on Israeli television. Netanyahu said the US president was likely to release his long-touted Middle East peace plan soon. US officials have suggested the plan will not include a Palestinian state, something Netanyahu has promised to never let happen. A White House official said there had been no change in its policy and would not comment further. Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s longest-serving leader, is battling for his political survival and the announcement was interpreted as a rallying cry to his hardline rightwing base. The prime minister stood in front of a large map on an easel that showed Israeli sovereignty extended over the vast majority of the Jordan Valley. It appeared to display Israeli territory completely encircling the West Bank, slicing off the eastern border with Jordan. Jericho, a Palestinian city, and smaller Palestinian villages were displayed as enclaves that would not be annexed. Netanyahu said: \u201cToday, I announce my intention, after the establishment of a new government, to apply Israeli sovereignty to the Jordan Valley and the northern Dead Sea. \u201cThis map defines our eastern frontier.

Jordan\u2019s foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, warned the plan would \u201cpush the whole region towards violence\u201d. And later on Tuesday evening, Netanyahu was dragged away by his security team from a campaign rally in the southern city of Ashdod after air sirens sounded. The Israeli military said two rockets had been launched from Gaza, both of which were intercepted by its aerial defence system. Saudi Arabia condemned it as a \u201cdangerous escalation against the Palestinian people\u201d and called for an emergency meeting of foreign ministers from the 57 member states of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), the official Saudi Press Agency said, citing the royal court. Hundreds of thousands of settlers live in outposts in the West Bank, which Israel\u2019s military continues to rule, controlling the lives of more than 2.5 million Palestinians. The prime minister made a similar pledge in April to annex Israeli settlements, but the latest announcement appeared to extend to a much larger part of the Palestinian territories that border Jordan. He made the earlier statement two days before an election in which he came out ahead with support from pro-settler nationalists. But Netanyahu was unable to form a coalition and forced a second election. The senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said that if Netanyahu\u2019s latest plan went ahead, \u201che would have succeeded in burying even any chance of peace between Palestinians and Israelis\u201d. He added: \u201cWe need to end the conflict and not to keep it for another 100 years.\u201d Ayman Odeh, the leader of an alliance of Arab parties in Israel, called Netanyahu\u2019s statement \u201cnot just election spin\u201d but \u201ca vision of apartheid\u201d. The international community considers Israeli settlements illegal under international law, built on land confiscated from Palestinian families. Extending Israeli sovereignty over such a large area would also be seen as putting an end to fading hopes for a Palestinian state, as there would be little unbroken land on which to create it. Trump\u2019s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital early in his term further damaged the two-state ideal. The Palestinians regard the occupied eastern section of Jerusalem as the capital of any future state, and cut contact with Washington after the declaration. Earlier this year, Trump also recognised Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, a plateau Israel captured from Syria in the same 1967 conflict and annexed in 1981. The move broke from the international consensus following the second world war that forbids territorial conquest during war. Palestinians warned at the time that it set a dangerous precedent for land grabs in the West Bank. In Israeli politics, however, annexation is a popular position. Israel has long stated it would want to keep the 2,400-sq km (926.65-sqmile) Jordan Valley to maintain control over the international border. Benny Gantz, the head of the main opposition party, Blue and White, said Netanyahu had stolen his idea. \u201cBlue and White have made clear that the Jordan Valley is a part of Israel forever. We are happy that Netanyahu has come around to adopt the Blue and White plan to recognise the Jordan Valley,\u201d he said. J Street, a liberal pro-Israel lobby in the US, said Netanyahu\u2019s annexation plan \u201cwould destroy Israeli democracy and constitute a flagrant violation of international law\u201d. Jeremy Ben-Ami, the group\u2019s president, said it would \u201cmake the occupation permanent and condemn millions of Palestinians to a future of living under unending Israeli rule, without basic civil rights or self-determination.\u201d",

Attorneys for Square, a $25.9bn payment processing company, filed the lawsuit last week, alleging that \u201cthe city\u2019s tax as applied to Square is unconstitutional\u201d. The lawsuit came about in 2017, when the city tax collector Jose Cisneros audited the taxes paid by Square in 2014 and 2015 and issued the company a notice that it had failed to pay the total amount owed. The additional amount due came from a reclassification of Square to a category of \u201cfinancial services\u201d rather than \u201cinformation\u201d. The latter category has a lower tax rate and \u201csignificantly more favorable apportionment methodology\u201d, the lawsuit reads. The company filed a petition for redetermination, which was denied, and ultimately paid the amount owed. Square filed a claim for a refund that was again denied by the city, this time in March. In addition to the reclassification, Square alleged that the city does not include the interchange fees it takes to process a payment in its calculations of the company\u2019s gross receipts tax. Because the company is a payment processor, the company doesn\u2019t receive the entirety of each payment; a percentage goes to financial institutions or other third parties. However, the city assesses the tax on the full amount, the lawsuit alleges. \u201cWe have and will continue to pay our fair share, but when we\u2019re treated differently than other companies and taxed on money we never actually receive, this is not fair or consistent,\u201d a Square spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ve done everything we can over several years now to work with the city in pursuit of a resolution. Unfortunately, litigation is our only remaining option, which we hope will open up better lines of communication so we can resolve this in the best interests of Square and San Francisco.\u201d John Cot\u00e9, a spokesman for the San Francisco city attorney, called the lawsuit \u201cunnecessary\u201d. \u201cWe believe Square was properly taxed,\u201d he said. Jack Dorsey, the chief executive of Square, received a tax break in 2011 for his company Twitter to stay in San Francisco. Because of the tax break, city officials estimate that Twitter saved $40m in taxes on stock compensation in the two years since going public. Dorsey was also an outspoken opponent of a measure proposed last year to raise much-needed funds to combat homelessness by implementing an average 0.5% gross receipts tax for companies with revenues over $50m. The measure passed with 60% of the vote, but it is still tied up in courts.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re ending the liveblog for now, as we await the results of North Carolina\u2019s ninth district election. With just about half the votes counted, democrat Dan McCready is and republican Dan Bishop are neck and neck, each with just under 50% of the votes. Look for The Guardian\u2019s coverage of the winner, once all the votes are tallied. In the meantime, here\u2019s a recap of today\u2019s political news: That\u2019s it from me on this very eventful Tuesday, brought to you by Trump\u2019s habit of firing senior officials by tweet. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: In case you missed the roughly 10,000 headlines: Trump fired John Bolton just days after reports emerged that the national security adviser had opposed the president\u2019s controversial plan to hold secret talks with the Taliban at Camp David. But, but, but: Bolton claimed he had actually offered his resignation to Trump the day before but that the president said they would return to the issue later. Trump asserted he asked for Bolton\u2019s resignation last night and received it this morning. Bolton\u2019s deputy, Charlie Kupperman, is taking over as acting national security advisor while the White House searches for a permanent replacement. Some Democrats bemoaned the \u201cinstability\u201d of Trump throwing aside a third national security adviser since taking office, but most just wished the hawkish Bolton \u201cgood riddance\u201d. Congressional Democrats and Republicans sparred over gun policy as Mitch McConnell reiterated he would not bring a bill to the Senate floor unless it had Trump\u2019s blessing. Murphy, a physician, decisively defeated his democratic opponent Allen Thomas and will succeed the late GOP Rep. Walter Jones Jr. With more than half of the votes counted, Murphy won by nearly 60%. This was expected \u2014 North Carolina\u2019s third district leans heavily republican. The more competitive election in the state\u2019s ninth district is still too close to call. The election between McCready and Dan Bishop in North Carolina\u2019s Ninth District isn\u2019t the only race going on in the state. Votes are also being tallied up in the North Carolina\u2019s Third, where the representative seat was left open after congressman Walter B. Jones Jr. died in February. Republican Greg Murphy is running against democrat Allen Thomas, the Former of Greenville. The district leans heavily republican and Murphy is leading as the results trickle in. The fact that McCready, a Democrat, narrowly lost in 2018 (but just 905 votes) was a surprise in itself. The district has leaned heavily Republican in the past. Trump won the district by 12 points 2016, and Mitt Romney running back 2012 against Barak Obama, won by 12 points as well. The polls have closed, though we\u2019re still awaiting the results of the fiercely contested election. Democrat Dan McCready is running a close race against Republican Dan Bishop. The special election is the culmination of a months-long political scandal. McCready narrowly lost in 2018, against republic Mark Harris. But state officials voided the results and order a new election after evidence emerged that Harris\u2019s campaign had funded a \u201cballot harvesting.\u201d A political operative working for Harris\u2019 was charged with paying people that he recruited $125 for every 50 mail-in ballots they collected and turned into him. The House Freedom Caucus, a group of far-right lawmakers within Congress, has elected a new chairman: Andy Biggs of Arizona. Biggs will take the place of the current chair, North Carolina\u2019s Mark Meadows starting October 1. The Caucus often butt heads with Republican leadership, looking to push the party farther right. But the group\u2019s influence has waned since democrats took control of the house. Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar had a chance to spar a bit ahead of Thursday\u2019s Democratic primary debate... ... when they were seated next to each other on a flight. Hunters and anglers can now shoot and cast their rods on federally protected land that serves as critical habitat waterfowl and other birds, in the administration\u2019s latest effort to open up protected lands to recreation as well as industry \u2014 including oil and gas drilling. Hunting and fishing will now be allowed for the first time at seven national wildlife refuges, and restrictions will be reduced at 70 others. More context from the AP: Conservationists said the changes went into effect without adequate environmental review. \u201cWhile the Trump policy retains federal ownership, it basically eviscerates federal management,\u201d said Jeff Ruch of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility. \u201cThe states end up managing federal land with federal dollars but following state laws. That\u2019s a sea change from federal management for conservation and biodiversity rather than promoting hunting.\u201d One of the big concerns is that state and federal officials don\u2019t appear to have a monitoring system to see what effect the changes might have, not only on game species but those that aren\u2019t hunted, Ruch said. The Trump administration is ordering a \u201csweeping crackdown\u201d on homelessness in California, The Washington Post reports. Administration officials have been discussing using federal funds and resources to get homeless people off the streets of Los Angeles and into government facilities, as part of a broader effort to target California, Baltimore, Chicago and other cities and states that Trump believes suffer poverty and crime due to failed Democratic leadership: But it is unclear how they could accomplish this and what legal authority they would use. It is also unclear whether the state\u2019s Democratic politicians would cooperate with Trump, who has sought to embarrass them over the homelessness crisis with repeated attacks on their competency. ... Top officials representing the White House and Department of Housing and Urban Development arrived in California this week for a round of meetings. A particular focus has been the \u201cskid row\u201d section of Los Angeles, officials said. The president is directly involved with the initiative, officials said, and has asked for updates. Among the ideas under consideration is razing existing tent camps for the homeless, creating new temporary facilities, or refurbishing existing government facilities, two officials said. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because the planning hasn\u2019t been publicly revealed. The changes would attempt to give the federal government a larger role in supervising housing and health care for residents. That\u2019s it from me on this very eventful Tuesday, brought to you by Trump\u2019s habit of firing senior officials by tweet. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: In case you missed the roughly 10,000 headlines: Trump fired John Bolton just days after reports emerged that the national security adviser had opposed the president\u2019s controversial plan to hold secret talks with the Taliban at Camp David. But, but, but: Bolton claimed he had actually offered his resignation to Trump the day before but that the president said they would return to the issue later. Trump asserted he asked for Bolton\u2019s resignation last night and received it this morning. Bolton\u2019s deputy, Charlie Kupperman, is taking over as acting national security adviser while the White House searches for a permanent replacement. Some Democrats bemoaned the \u201cinstability\u201d of Trump throwing aside a third national security adviser since taking office, but most just wished the hawkish Bolton \u201cgood riddance\u201d. But there was important other news being made today. Voting is underway in North Carolina\u2019s ninth congressional district, where a special election is being read for signs of Trump\u2019s resiliency in areas he carried in 2016. Congressional Republicans downplayed expectations of a win this afternoon. Congressional Democrats and Republicans sparred over gun policy as Mitch McConnell reiterated he would not bring a bill to the Senate floor unless it had Trump\u2019s blessing. Maanvi will have more on the news of the day, so stay tuned. Some names are already being floated as possible replacements for Bolton as national security adviser. His deputy, Charlie Kupperman, has currently assumed the role on an acting basis. Bloomberg News reports: Kupperman is a Bolton confidant who has counseled the former national security adviser for more than 30 years, Bolton has said. Grisham said it was \u2018too soon to say\u2019 whether Bolton\u2019s closest National Security Council aides would remain in their jobs. Possible Bolton replacements discussed by Trump associates include Robert O\u2019Brien, who is the president\u2019s envoy for hostage affairs, and Brian Hook, [secretary of state Mike] Pompeo\u2019s senior policy adviser. CNN has just released a poll showing Trump\u2019s approval rating has hit 39 percent, its lowest point in the network\u2019s polling since January. Arguably more worrisome for the president is that 6 in 10 Americans don\u2019t believe he deserves re-election. The results corroborate the Washington Post/ABC News poll released this morning, which showed the president\u2019s approval rating at 38 percent. (Trump lashed out against those results in a pair of morning tweets, so CNN can expect the same.) CNN has more on the results: Overall, the poll paints a picture of a President who has done little to improve negative impressions of him or his work during his time in office. Across several questions asked early in Trump\u2019s time in office and asked again now, the poll finds little positive change and deep partisan polarization. The 60% who say the President does not deserve to be reelected is similar to the 63% who felt that way in November 2017. That outpaces his most recent predecessors at a similar stage in their presidencies. In October 2003, a CNN/Gallup/USA Today poll found that 52% of Americans thought George W. Bush did deserve reelection, and Gallup\u2019s polling in 2011 found the share saying Barack Obama did not deserve to be reelected stood in the low 50s. Trump\u2019s approval rating is also historically low for presidents seeking re-election, a CNN reporter noted. The only president who had a lower approval rating a year before his second election was Jimmy Carter ... who lost to Ronald Reagan. There is indeed still a special congressional race being held today in North Carolina, just in case you forget amid the Trump personnel turmoil. Republicans are appearing less and less confident that their candidate, Dan Bishop, can pull off a win in the traditionally red Ninth District. Trump carried the district by 12 points back in 2016, but a senior House Republican told reporters today that it was a \u201cswing district.\u201d A loss would not only be embarrassing for Republicans, who have dumped $20 million into the race, but potentially ominous as well. If the party can\u2019t carry the Ninth District, which covers some of the suburbs outside Charlotte, it may have trouble in similar districts across the country \u2013 which could prove disastrous for 2020. But, as a Republican strategist noted, the actual consequences of this race are quite minimal. It\u2019s more a matter of controlling the dreaded \u201cnarrative.\u201d A handful of Democratic presidential candidates have offered the same message to the departing national security adviser: we won\u2019t miss you. Bolton\u2019s nomination as national security adviser was widely criticized by Democrats when it was announced in March 2018, given the former UN ambassador\u2019s support for using military force against adversaries like North Korea and Iran. Those stances initially sat well with Trump, who once promised \u201cfire and fury\u201d against North Korea. But the president has more recently shifted that position after meeting with Kim Jong-un, calling the North Korean dictator \u201ca great leader.\u201d Bolton was the wrong messenger for Trump\u2019s shifting foreign policy as the president angles for re-election, the Guardian\u2019s Julian Borger writes. Donald Trump hired Bolton to break things, like the Obama administration legacy and the orthodox foreign policy establishment in general. Now, with the 2020 election coming, a downturn looming and a second presidential term in doubt, Trump is trying to build a foreign policy legacy of his own \u2013 or at least a reasonable impression of one. For the president, that involves shaking hands with adversaries and announcing diplomatic breakthroughs with the likes of Tehran and the Taliban. Almost no one expected him to be able to make that hairpin pivot with someone as bellicose and determined as Bolton at his side. Bolton\u2019s resignation letter has been obtained, and it is indeed (as previously reported) two sentences long. It\u2019s notable that the ousted national security adviser chose not to detail his policy differences with Trump in the letter, as former defense secretary Jim Mattis did when he resigned in December. Bolton has said he was not fired and that he offered his resignation last night. But if that\u2019s the case, one might expect a bit more ... elaboration in his resignation letter. Then again, Bolton said Trump offered to discuss the issue further today. So the president\u2019s tweet may still have caught the national security adviser off guard, particularly given that Bolton was supposed to participate in a White House briefing this afternoon. News is coming out on multiple fronts as reactions and details continue to roll in about Trump\u2019s firing of Bolton. Most notably, congressional Democrats and Republicans continue to spar about potential gun legislation after last month\u2019s mass shootings that left dozens dead. Mitch McConnell said he was waiting on the White House to craft a bill Trump would sign, arguing everything else surrounding the gun debate was \u201ctheatrics.\u201d Those \u201ctheatrics\u201d would appear to include the three gun bills House Democrats are currently attempting to advance. The background checks bill they passed months ago has never been brought up for a vote in the Senate, and Trump has said he would veto it. Chuck Schumer denounced McConnell\u2019s \u201ctheatrics\u201d comment. \u201cShame on him,\u201d the Senate minority leader said at his press conference. Rose-colored glasses are apparently quite powerful. Trump has reportedly been reaching out to the last national security adviser he unceremoniously ousted, H.R. McMaster, to say he misses him. NBC News reports: In phone calls to McMaster \u2014 the first of which took place last fall \u2014 Trump told his second national security adviser that he misses him, according to two people familiar with the conversations. It\u2019s a sentiment the president has also expressed to White House aides, they said. Trump has solicited McMaster\u2019s advice on various national security challenges, even asking McMaster who he should nominate to lead the Pentagon, they said. Trump\u2019s contacts with McMaster perhaps presaged his decision Tuesday to unceremoniously fire Bolton. They also marked a significant a remarkable shift for the president that is emblematic of how much Bolton fell out of favor since Trump welcomed him into the White House 17 months ago. At that time, Trump was barely speaking to McMaster and regularly did derogatory impressions of him in his absence, according to multiple current and former White House officials. Trump has just finished speaking at the HBCU conference, but the blog is keeping its eye on press conferences on Capitol Hill. Mitch McConnell would not specify what type of gun legislation he would support, deferring to the White House. The Senate majority leader previously said he would not hold a vote on any gun proposal unless it had Trump\u2019s endorsement, seemingly ruling out the background checks bill that has already passed the House. Trump has said he would veto that legislation. Another three proposals that House Democrats are working to pass after last month\u2019s mass shootings would likely also be dead on arrival in the Senate. Trump appeared anxious to confront the eventual Democratic presidential nominee, saying he looked forward to touting his economic successes on the debate stage. \u201cWho\u2019s going to beat these numbers?\u201d Trump asked the crowd at the National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week Conference after listing some unemployment statistics. Trump dismissed any sign of a looming recession while speaking at the National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week Conference. The president suggested warnings of a potential recession were being circulated by his critics to diminish his re-election chances. \u201cThey were hoping for a recession,\u201d Trump said, adding that he expects the stock market to hit a new record in the near future. A new poll released this morning showed 6 in 10 Americans believe a recession is likely within the next year. Trump has taken the stage at the National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week Conference and appears to (so far) be sticking to the teleprompter. He has touted the importance of HBCUs and celebrated his education secretary, Betsy DeVos, as a champion for the institutions. Trump is expected to soon start speaking at the National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week Conference. The president was scheduled to take the podium at 2:15 p.m. E.T. but is apparently running behind. Pompeo made a point during the White House press conference, which has now wrapped up, to emphasize he had policy disagreements with Bolton. The secretary of state, who reportedly clashed with Bolton repeatedly in recent months, appeared (in the words of one reporter) \u201calmost gleeful\u201d as he discussed the national security adviser\u2019s departure. This widely shared photo of Pompeo and Mnuchin seemed a perfect encapsulation of their dynamic. Steven Mnuchin dismissed any notion that Bolton\u2019s departure signaled the national security team was a \u201cmess.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the most ridiculous question I\u2019ve ever heard,\u201d the treasury secretary said. That being said, Trump has had three national security advisers since taking office, and Barack Obama had the same number over two terms. George W. Bush only had two over his eight years in office. Pompeo delivered a pretty iconic response when asked whether he was caught off-guard by Bolton\u2019s firing. \u201cI\u2019m never surprised,\u201d the secretary of state said. Pompeo went on to scold the press, encouraging journalists not to focus on \u201cpalace intrigue.\u201d The recommendation seems odd given all the reporting about Pompeo and Bolton\u2019s relationship, which had deteriorated to the point where the pair rarely spoke outside of formal meetings. There it is! First question at the White House briefing with Mike Pompeo and Steven Mnuchin: did Bolton resign, or was he fired? The secretary of state echoed Trump\u2019s claim that he asked Bolton for his resignation last night and received it this morning. Pompeo added, \u201cThe president is entitled to the staff he wants.\u201d But Pompeo deflected when asked whether the argument over the planned Taliban peace talks was the impetus for Bolton\u2019s departure. Steven Mnuchin, the treasury secretary, and Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, have taken the podium at the White House. The pair are currently speaking about a new executive order on counter-terrorism sanctions, and Mnuchin said they would then take a few questions. It seems unlikely that those questions will center on counter-terrorism sanctions, given that the now-fired John Bolton was originally scheduled to appear alongside the two officials. NBC News is reporting that deputy national security adviser Charlie Kupperman has been named the acting national security adviser. Kupperman was appointed earlier this year amid intense criticism from civil rights group. Al Jazeera reported back in January: Kupperman served on the board of directors for the Center for Security Policy (CSP) between 2001 and 2010, according to tax records. The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), an Alabama-based hate monitor, designates the CSP as an anti-Muslim hate group, pointing to the group\u2019s promotion of conspiracy theories claiming that Muslims have infiltrated the US government and seek to establish Islamic law in the country. The Council for American Islamic Relations (CAIR) has called on the Trump administration to revoke Kupperman\u2019s appointment. \u2018Once again this is an example of Trump elevating foxes into the hen house, where Islamophobes are well placed to direct our nation\u2019s national security priorities,\u2019 Robert McCaw, director of CAIR\u2019s government affairs department, told Al Jazeera. White House spokesperson Hogan Gidley went on Fox News to echo Trump\u2019s claim that Bolton was fired and did not resign. That obviously contradicts Bolton\u2019s assertion that he offered Trump his resignation last night and the president said they would discuss it today. Gidley emphasized that Bolton\u2019s priorities \u201cdid not align with President Trump\u2019s,\u201d arguing that Trump \u201chas the right\u201d to appoint people who agree with him. Although Gidley said he was \u201cnot going to get in the back and forth here,\u201d he did take a moment to stress that Trump asked for Bolton\u2019s resignation. Gidley said the White House was \u201cin the process\u201d of searching for a new national security adviser. Bolton\u2019s firing followed a tense argument with Trump about the planned Taliban peace talks, per a CNN reporter. Another CNN reporter noted the firing was so sudden that Bolton led a meeting this morning, similar to James Comey learning he had been fired as FBI director by a cable news alert while speaking in California. The effects of Trump\u2019s firing decisions (by tweet, no less) have once again reverberated around the world. The price of oil immediately nosedived after news of Bolton\u2019s departure broke. Bolton has reportedly left the White House and will no longer participate in the afternoon briefing with Mike Pompeo and Steven Mnuchin, much to the disappointment of Washington\u2019s press corps. Meanwhile, Bolton\u2019s now-former employees at the National Security Council are telling reporters his side of the story, creating tension with the White House aides promoting Trump\u2019s version of events. Bolton appears to be texting every reporter whose number he has in his contacts list, reiterating that he was not fired and offered his resignation last night. The ousted national security adviser also said he would \u201chave my say in due course,\u201d a potentially ominous idea for a presidency that has been repeatedly derailed by former aides\u2019 tell-all books. To be clear: Bolton isn\u2019t necessarily gaining any friends in this showdown. Many of the hawkish national security adviser\u2019s critics, on both sides of the aisle, are celebrating his departure. A Republican senator who opposed his nomination said this to a CNN reporter: From the congressman who cut ties with the Republican Party over its Trump support: From a senior adviser to Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg: Bolton is not going down without a fight. After tweeting that he offered his resignation to Trump, the now-former national security adviser is apparently reaching out to reporters to amplify that narrative. The White House denied that Bolton\u2019s firing was based solely on his opposition to the planned Taliban peace talks at Camp David. But Trump has historically held grudges against aides who disagree with him, particularly when those aides receive favorable press coverage for doing so. After many lawmakers, including some Republicans, voiced shock at the proposal to host the Taliban so close to the 9/11 anniversary, Bolton\u2019s reported opposition appeared quite sage. Bolton has just sent out a fiery tweet of his own, claiming he offered Trump his resignation last night and the president delayed the decision. In contrast, the president said he requested Bolton\u2019s resignation last night, which was offered this morning. The national security adviser had been repeatedly sidelined recently as he voiced disagreement with Trump\u2019s efforts to secure an end to the war in Afghanistan. The Washington Post recently reported: Bolton, who has long advocated an expansive military presence around the world, has become a staunch internal foe of an emerging peace deal aimed at ending America\u2019s longest war, the officials said. His opposition to the diplomatic effort in Afghanistan has irritated President Trump, these officials said, and led aides to leave the National Security Council out of sensitive discussions about the agreement. The sidelining of Bolton has raised questions about his influence in an administration that is seeking a troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, as well as an ambitious nuclear deal with North Korea and potential engagement with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. Bolton, U.S. officials said, stands in opposition to those efforts, but he does so increasingly from the periphery. This tweet is likely shocking news to both Bolton and the White House, who just announced that the national security adviser would appear alongside Mike Pompeo and Steven Mnuchin at a press briefing at 1:30 p.m. E.T. Trump has just announced that he has fired John Bolton just days after reports emerged that the national security adviser opposed the president\u2019s secret plan to hold peace talks with the Taliban at Camp David. Democratic presidential candidates are also coming out in force to endorse congressional candidate Dan McCready, who is running in today\u2019s special election in North Carolina. Democratic presidential candidates rushed to condemn Trump\u2019s health care policies after the Census reported the US uninsured rate rose last year despite the strong economy. The Democratic 2020 field is unanimous in its condemnation of the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but candidates differ strongly on whether to simply expand Obamacare or overhaul it with a Medicare-for-all system. And with Democratic voters similarly divided over which system is best, the issue is sure to be one of the most prominent in the primary race. An addition to today\u2019s schedule: secretary of state Mike Pompeo, treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and national security adviser John Bolton will have an on-camera White House briefing at 1:30 p.m. E.T. The briefing will ostensibly focus on combating terrorism. But if the three senior officials take questions from reporters, they are almost certain to be asked about Trump\u2019s scrapped plans to hold peace talks with the Taliban at Camp David. Pompeo was reportedly in favor of the controversial plan, while Bolton was strongly opposed to it. Pompeo and Bolton have also reportedly been clashing behind the scenes, and the two men rarely speak to each other outside of formal meetings. The acting commissioner of Customs and Border Patrol, Mark Morgan, held a White House briefing yesterday as well \u2014 even as Trump\u2019s press secretary steadfastly avoids the podium. A fact-checking reporter for CNN has added, in response to Trump\u2019s complaint about the latest Washington Post/ABC News poll showing his approval rating down, that the outlets involved never received a legal complaint from the president\u2019s team. Trump\u2019s tweet has had the unintended (and entirely predictable) effect of putting even more attention on the results of the poll, which showed his approval rating dipping down to 38 percent. Here are a couple more data points from the poll: The US uninsured rate rose by 0.6 percent last year despite the strong economy, as millions more Americans went without health coverage. Bloomberg News reports: The increase in the rate of uninsured, from 7.9% in 2017 to 8.5% last year, is particularly remarkable given the falling unemployment rate during that period, since most Americans get coverage through work. It\u2019s the first meaningful uptick in the number of people without health coverage since the main provisions of the Affordable Care Act took effect in 2014. While the economy grew in 2018, individual health insurance premiums continued to increase, states tightened eligibility requirements for public safety-net coverage, and President Donald Trump carried on in his attempt to undo many of the health reforms passed by his predecessor. The Census report indicates that the biggest decrease in coverage in 2018 came among those covered by Medicaid, the state-federal health program for low-income Americans. Almost two million fewer people were covered by Medicaid in 2018 than in the prior year. Trump\u2019s commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, is facing calls for his resignation after he reportedly threatened firings at the NOAA unless the agency backed up the president\u2019s false claim about Hurricane Dorian hitting Alabama. The Guardian\u2019s Ed Pilkington reports: The head of the environmental group the Sierra Club, Michael Brune, called on Ross to resign to \u2018maintain the dignity of the federal government\u2019. Brune called the intervention a \u2018shameless abuse of power\u2019 that could have \u2018devastating results now and in the future\u2019. Democratic congress members Don Beyer from Virginia and Paul Tonko from New York also called on Ross to step down. And late on Monday, the New York Times amended its story to report that the commerce department\u2019s own Office of Inspector General has launched an inquiry into that official statement and whether it breached departmental rules. That adds to an investigation initiated on Sunday by the Noaa\u2019s acting chief scientist, Craig McLean. He sent an email to colleagues announcing that he was looking into how the agency had come to disavow its own experts in backing Trump\u2019s inaccurate claim. Trump has gone even further, claiming that many polls are \u201cfixed, or worked in such a way that a certain candidate will look good or bad.\u201d This accusation seems, to this blog, entirely baseless. At least when it comes to 2016 national polls, most of them were pretty close to the actual result. For example, the Washington Post/ABC News poll (the initial source of Trump\u2019s ire today) predicted just before Election Day 2016 that Hillary Clinton would win the popular vote by 4 points. She ended up winning it by 2 points but lost the Electoral College and the presidency along with it. Of course, another one of Trump\u2019s favorite baseless claims is that Clinton only won the popular vote because of voter fraud in blue states like California. If that were the case (and it\u2019s not), she really should have sent some of those fake California voters to Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan. It could have given her the White House. So apparently Trump does occasionally read the \u201cAmazon Washington Post.\u201d The president slammed the newspaper, along with ABC News, for publishing a poll showing his approval rating down 6 points since June. This gives the blog a chance to revisit those numbers. According to the poll, Trump\u2019s approval has sunk to 38 percent amid intensifying fears about the economy. Six in 10 Americans now expect a recession to occur in the next year. It\u2019s understandable why Trump would want to distance himself from those numbers, particularly given that he is counting on a strong economy to win re-election. But the president\u2019s attack on the polling methodology seems unfounded. The polling and analysis website FiveThirtyEight gives Washington Post/ABC News polls a rating of \u201cA+,\u201d and national polls in 2016 were not far off from the actual result of Trump losing the popular vote. More details are coming to light about the high-level source reportedly extracted from the Russian government in 2017, partly over concerns that the person\u2019s identity may be revealed by Trump or his administration. The New York Times has now reported the source provided secrets to the US for decades and was a key informant on Russia\u2019s 2016 election interference. But the Times threw a bit of cold water on the idea that Trump was one of the reasons for the extraction. From the paper\u2019s front-page report: As American officials began to realize that Russia was trying to sabotage the 2016 presidential election, the informant became one of the C.I.A.\u2019s most important \u2014 and highly protected \u2014 assets. But when intelligence officials revealed the severity of Russia\u2019s election interference with unusual detail later that year, the news media picked up on details about the C.I.A.\u2019s Kremlin sources. C.I.A. officials worried about safety made the arduous decision in late 2016 to offer to extract the source from Russia. The situation grew more tense when the informant at first refused, citing family concerns \u2014 prompting consternation at C.I.A. headquarters and sowing doubts among some American counterintelligence officials about the informant\u2019s trustworthiness. But the C.I.A. pressed again months later after more media inquiries. This time, the informant agreed. ... The decision to extract the informant was driven \u2018in part\u2019 because of concerns that Mr. Trump and his administration had mishandled delicate intelligence, CNN reported. But former intelligence officials said there was no public evidence that Mr. Trump directly endangered the source, and other current American officials insisted that media scrutiny of the agency\u2019s sources alone was the impetus for the extraction. Trump has sent out repeated Twitter endorsements for Dan Bishop, the Republican running in North Carolina\u2019s special congressional race. The latest one came about 20 minutes ago. Of course, if Bishop loses, this blog would bet good money that Trump will drop him as quickly as it takes to write out 280 characters. The race is being read as a sign of Trump\u2019s resilience in areas like North Carolina\u2019s Ninth Congressional District, which covers some of the southeastern suburbs of Charlotte. The 2018 midterms showed Republicans were losing support in those parts of the country, and today could indicate whether the party has stopped the bleeding. Regardless of the winner, the victorious side will almost certainly rush to trumpet the results as a reflection of Trump\u2019s presidency as the losing team downplays the race as just one district of many that could go the other way next year. Speaking of special congressional races: a certain ghost of special races past has resurfaced \u2014 Jon Ossoff. The former Democratic congressional candidate announced he would run against senator David Perdue, a Republican of Georgia. In case you forgot about him (this blog certainly did), Ossoff narrowly lost to Karen Handel in a 2017 special election for Georgia\u2019s Sixth Congressional District. Because it was the first major race after Trump\u2019s election, Ossoff benefited from immense fundraising and organizing energy on the left. But the roughly $30 million he raised was for naught; he lost to Handel by about 4 points. (Handel, in turn, lost to Democrat Lucy McBath the next year.) Now Ossoff has jumped into the race against Perdue. Although he already has three primary opponents (and will likely get more), Ossoff immediately got an immediate boost with an endorsement from a Georgia celebrity: John Lewis, the longtime congressman and civil rights icon. \u201cLike the many thousands Jon has already organized and inspired, I am ready to work tirelessly to elect him,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cGeorgia and America need Jon.\u201d Good morning, live blog readers! It\u2019s another (special) election day here in the US. North Carolina\u2019s Ninth District will hold a congressional race today after the 2018 results were thrown out due to election fraud. Donald Trump held a rally there last night to boost Republican Dan Bishop, and the Democratic Party has lined up behind Dan McCready, who lost by less than 1,000 votes in last year\u2019s tainted election. The race is being read as a sign of Trump\u2019s popularity (or lack there of) in districts he easily carried in 2016. (The president won the Ninth District by 11 points back in 2016.) If Bishop can\u2019t win today, will Trump be able to carry the Ninth (and other places like it) next year? Trump\u2019s latest approval rating may give some insight on that last question. According to the latest Washington Post-ABC News poll, the president\u2019s approval has slipped 6 points, down to 38 percent, since June. The decline seems mostly attributable to worsening attitudes about the economy, with 6 in 10 Americans expecting a recession in the next year. Trump has been boasting of the strong economy for the past two years, and his team is banking on it to sail to re-election. Without it, he could be left floundering \u2014 taking a certain North Carolina congressional candidate down with him. Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping its eye on today: Trump will have lunch with Mike Pence before speaking at the National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week Conference. He will later meet with congressional Republican leadership and participate in the swearing-in ceremony of the new US ambassador to the UN, Kelly Craft. One minor thing first: Craft actually has to be confirmed by the Senate first. The chamber will hold a 10 a.m. E.T. vote on her nomination. Steven Mnuchin, the treasury secretary, and Ben Carson, the housing and urban development secretary, will testify before the Senate committee on housing finance reform. That\u2019s all still coming up, so stay tuned.",

      "bodyText": "Chen Siming, a 58-year-old Chinese activist, has followed the protests in Hong Kong from afar, feeling inspired but also helpless. From across the border in the southern province of Hunan, Chen does what he can to support the thousands calling for greater democracy in Hong Kong. In late August, he and more than 20 others posted online selfies of themselves covering their right eye, a gesture of solidarity for a young Hong Kong woman who says she was badly injured during a clash between police and protesters. Last week, Chen was summoned \u201cfor a chat\u201d with the police \u2013 the sixth time he has been questioned by police, who also interrogated more than 20 others who posted the self portraits. The police threatened Chen with imprisonment and suggested his son could be badly affected. The police call him every day to check his whereabouts. \u201cThey play hard and soft at the same time. Sometimes they say good things and sometimes they threaten you. They try all kinds of ways,\u201d he said. But Chen has not been dissuaded. He regularly \u201cjumps\u201d China\u2019s great firewall to access foreign news sites and posts links in a Wechat group of more than 200 people. Every few days censors shut down the group, but he and his friends keep reopening it. The group is now on its 20th iteration. \u201cI feel deeply ashamed that we can\u2019t do anything. Morally speaking, if you don\u2019t condemn a crime, you are complicit in it,\u201d he added. Chen is one of dozens of Chinese intellectuals, activists, and regular people in the mainland who support the protests in Hong Kong but have had their voices muffled by Chinese authorities. On the mainland officials have been quick to censor Hong Kong-related news that has not been sanctioned and detain the few activists who have travelled to to the special administrative region. In the lead up to China\u2019s 1 October National Day, when the country celebrates 70 years of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China, authorities are more sensitive than usual. Chen and other Chinese activists have been ordered not to travel to Hong Kong until after 10 October. Chinese Human Rights Defenders, a rights advocacy group, has documented more than 20 cases of mainland Chinese being threatened or detained for posting messages of support, traveling to Hong Kong, or just retweeting news stories about the protests. \u201cThe government\u2019s battle for Hong Kong is also being fought in mainland cities,\u201d wrote Frances Eve, deputy director of research. \u201cThe Chinese government is working overtime to threaten and detain mainlanders from sharing and commenting on the protests in Hong Kong for fear of what it may spark back home\u201d. Chen Quishi, a Beijing-based lawyer who traveled to Hong Kong in mid-August, saw his Weibo account shut down a few days after he published three videos of anti-government protests that were then reposted by others on Youtube. He was called back to Beijing and on Tuesday said he had to report to \u201cleaders\u201d what he was doing in Hong Kong and how his videos were reposted. \u201cI can understand. It is almost the national anniversary, so it is quite sensitive,\u201d Chen Qiushi said. Wei Xiaobing, an activist in Zhejiang province, was held for 15 days in June after he shared a Facebook post and a tweet that said: \u201ckeep it up Hong Kong!\u201d China\u2019s propaganda machine has been in overdrive over the last two months, depicting the protesters as rioters seeking to overthrow the government, but activists say many people see through it. \u201cActually a lot of young people on the mainland support Hong Kong but because of the suppression, the constant monitoring, they dare not speak out loudly,\u201d said Lu, a 25-year old resident of Shenzhen, just across the border from Hong Kong, who began going to the protests in June out of curiosity. Lu said he was shocked by scope and size of the protests and on 7 July, when demonstrators marched to a Kowloon rail station linking China and Hong Kong, he decided to join. After nervously crossing the border into Hong Kong that morning with a pair of clothes to change into, a pen and paper, he locked himself in a bathroom at a KFC. Trembling, he wrote the words on a sign that he held up that day: \u201cI\u2019m from mainland China, I am thankful to Hong Kong people! Don\u2019t give up, fight for freedom!\u2019 A little more than a month later after Lu attended several more protests, he was detained for 10 days in Shenzhen. He has now fled to Thailand and is debating what to do next. \u201cI really feel guilty and shameful. The price of this struggle should have been borne by us. Now Hong Kong people are bleeding for us and even losing their lives,\u201d he wrote in an essay on Medium. \u201cIt is our indifference, indulgence and indifference that has lead to more and more arrogance of this dictatorship until it endangers everyone,\u201d Lu added. The police have also ordered Chen to delete his account or his posts on Twitter, where he is also active, but he refused. Chen believes more regular Chinese citizens would support the protests if they had the right information. \u201cMany people don\u2019t know what is going on at all,\u201d he said. \u201cLike our compatriots in Hong Kong, we can\u2019t go back. We must stand out. To support the people of Hong Kong is to support ourselves,\u201d he said.",

The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bnhcrc.com.au/news/blogpost/richard-thornton/2019/grim-fire-season-looms-many-australians-remain-unprepared\">Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre</a>&nbsp;says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What other effects do carbon emissions have?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>So is climate change making everything dryer? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do recent weather patterns show?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 has been the fifth driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Authorities hoped milder conditions expected on Wednesday would give further reprieve to exhausted firefighters.</p> \n<p>The number of people in emergency evacuation centres had fallen from 400 to about 80 on Wednesday morning, and the Bureau of Meteorology expected cooler temperatures and lighter winds on Wednesday and Thursday would be favourable for firefighters.</p> \n<p>\u201cGiven that the weather conditions have moderated today, given that it\u2019s a much better day to get in and do some work to enable people to go back home, I think that today is going to be a lot better,\u201d Trad told the ABC on Wednesday.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/QldPolice/status/1171633484747726848\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This wasn't just another day at the office for our crews on the Sunshine Coast.

      "bodyText": "The New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian, will travel to bushfire-affected towns on the state\u2019s north on Wednesday, as authorities there and in Queensland hope milder conditions offer a reprieve from the more than 130 bushfires burning across the two states. On Queensland\u2019s Sunshine Coast, more than 5,000 people have been forced from their home with no timeline for return due to an out-of-control fire at Peregian Beach and Peregian Breeze Estate. One property was destroyed after the fire swept through the coastal towns on Monday night. Queensland\u2019s acting premier, Jackie Trad, said it was \u201cnothing short of a miracle\u201d more homes weren\u2019t lost in the fire. On Wednesday the fire remained out of control, and 40 homes were evacuated from the town Weyba Downs on Tuesday, inland from Peregian, as winds picked up. Resident Robert Campbell, who has yet to see his home following the fire, was stopped by authorities while returning from dinner on Monday night and told to flee. \u201cIt\u2019s surreal, I won\u2019t know the damage until we find out,\u201d Campbell said. Almost 80 fires continued to burn across the state. Blazes have destroying 33,000 hectares of bushland since late last week. A 737 aircraft dumped 15,000 litres of fire suppressant on the Sunshine Coast blaze on Tuesday, helping to ease the inferno. Authorities hoped milder conditions expected on Wednesday would give further reprieve to exhausted firefighters. The number of people in emergency evacuation centres had fallen from 400 to about 80 on Wednesday morning, and the Bureau of Meteorology expected cooler temperatures and lighter winds on Wednesday and Thursday would be favourable for firefighters. \u201cGiven that the weather conditions have moderated today, given that it\u2019s a much better day to get in and do some work to enable people to go back home, I think that today is going to be a lot better,\u201d Trad told the ABC on Wednesday. However the danger was expected to spike again on Friday and Saturday when temperatures rose. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, cut short a trip to Europe to return home but was criticised by the state\u2019s opposition for leaving for the trip on the weekend when fires were beginning to flare up. But Trad defended Palaszczuk, saying she had been unable to cancel the meeting, which was in relation to the state\u2019s 2032 Olympics bid. \u201cIt was, unfortunately, out of her realm of authority,\u201d she told the ABC. The Queensland Fire and Emergency Services said at least 17 homes and five commercial properties had been destroyed by bushfires since Thursday, with many more damaged. In NSW, Berejiklian will travel to Glen Innes and Tenterfield in the state\u2019s north to inspect the fire grounds. More than 100,000 hectares of bushland in NSW have been destroyed across three fires near Tenterfield, Armidale and Yamba. The Clarence Valley mayor Jim Simmons said he couldn\u2019t remember the area surrounding Yamba being so dry and described conditions as \u201creally terrible\u201d. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen anything like this in my lifetime,\u201d he said. As of Tuesday, nine homes and 34 outbuildings had been destroyed in NSW and another six homes damaged, with most of the losses occurring at the fire near Tenterfield. More than 220 homes in the immediate areas of the fires have been saved since the emergency began late last week.",

Although she\u2019s had pets her whole life, her current brood presents a challenge - each one has a chronic health need, and that\u2019s expensive. It\u2019s become increasingly important for Anna to create financial targets to make sure her furry friends are always covered.</p> <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t set out to furnish ourselves with sickly animals,\u201d she says. \u201cFirst, one of our dogs went blind and needed emergency surgery. Then, our vet found an underlying heart condition in one of our cats. And our other cat is old and will eventually need surgery to fix an issue with his nose. It\u2019s like having a collection of very expensive classic cars.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7eb071757bca08980b6b215aef8948c610b2af80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7eb071757bca08980b6b215aef8948c610b2af80/0_0_1920_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Puppy with vet\" width=\"1000\" height=\"800\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>With three animals to plan for - and all the other costs that come with having a family - Anna uses Westpac\u2019s account labelling function to keep track.</p> <p>\u201cI have separate accounts for different kinds of transactions,\u201d she says. \u201cI can name them within online banking so they\u2019re easier to identify. So, I have ANNA\u2019S EVERYDAY and GENERAL SAVINGS, and then PET EXPENSES.\u201d She laughs. \u201cDepending on how much they\u2019re costing me, the name might change. Sometimes it\u2019s called HOW DOES IT COST THIS MUCH?\u201d</p> <p>As a freelancer, Anna has irregular income, and that makes planning ahead even more important. When her invoices are paid, she divides the funds into four areas: living costs, long-term savings, pet expenses and tax. Through online banking, she can see at a glance how much money is available.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a general idea of how much we can expect to pay for their different surgeries. For example, when our dog needs his next eye surgery, it will cost about $1,500, so we can plan for that. The cats have regular scans to see how they\u2019re going, which is another $2,000 a year. Those are much easier to anticipate.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"af225b02d5e8d3b2e967570289c13cd35c3c5029\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af225b02d5e8d3b2e967570289c13cd35c3c5029/0_0_1920_2400/800.jpg\" alt=\"Piggy bank\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Each account has its intended purpose, but Anna acknowledges there\u2019s a need to be flexible.

      "bodyText": "Anna Lattin, 36, lives in Sydney with her partner, children, and a small menagerie. Although she\u2019s had pets her whole life, her current brood presents a challenge - each one has a chronic health need, and that\u2019s expensive. It\u2019s become increasingly important for Anna to create financial targets to make sure her furry friends are always covered. \u201cWe didn\u2019t set out to furnish ourselves with sickly animals,\u201d she says. \u201cFirst, one of our dogs went blind and needed emergency surgery. Then, our vet found an underlying heart condition in one of our cats. And our other cat is old and will eventually need surgery to fix an issue with his nose. It\u2019s like having a collection of very expensive classic cars.\u201d With three animals to plan for - and all the other costs that come with having a family - Anna uses Westpac\u2019s account labelling function to keep track. \u201cI have separate accounts for different kinds of transactions,\u201d she says. \u201cI can name them within online banking so they\u2019re easier to identify. So, I have ANNA\u2019S EVERYDAY and GENERAL SAVINGS, and then PET EXPENSES.\u201d She laughs. \u201cDepending on how much they\u2019re costing me, the name might change. Sometimes it\u2019s called HOW DOES IT COST THIS MUCH?\u201d As a freelancer, Anna has irregular income, and that makes planning ahead even more important. When her invoices are paid, she divides the funds into four areas: living costs, long-term savings, pet expenses and tax. Through online banking, she can see at a glance how much money is available. \u201cWe have a general idea of how much we can expect to pay for their different surgeries. For example, when our dog needs his next eye surgery, it will cost about $1,500, so we can plan for that. The cats have regular scans to see how they\u2019re going, which is another $2,000 a year. Those are much easier to anticipate.\u201d Each account has its intended purpose, but Anna acknowledges there\u2019s a need to be flexible. While she has pet insurance, it doesn\u2019t cover pre-existing conditions or new illnesses as the animals reach their twilight years. \u201cWhat happens next is anyone\u2019s guess. Having a sick animal comes with a lot of unknowns - what if there\u2019s an underlying issue we don\u2019t know about yet? What if it\u2019s about to have a bad flare-up? Having an account that\u2019s specifically for those unknowns gives me a real sense of security.\u201d Anna says the combination of a fluctuating income and unpredictable expenses can be stressful, so she breaks financial goals into bite-sized chunks. \u201cSometimes I\u2019ll put away my weekly savings in smaller amounts. Somehow it feels easier to transfer $25 four times than to do $100 all at once.\u201d Paying close attention to what\u2019s on special, buying seasonal produce, and cooking meals ahead of time all helps Anna have money left over. \u201cPutting away more than the minimum is really satisfying. Seeing the savings balance creep up feels heaps better than buying an extra coffee.\u201d She also uses budgeting apps that break down outgoings by category, so she can see how much is going on the essentials and how much on nice-to-haves. \u201cThat\u2019s been a real eye-opener. I thought I was spending much less on things like dining out and ad-hoc supermarket trips. When it was all laid out for me, I was shocked to see what I was really paying each month.\u201d Anna says she learned about saving from watching her parents do it. \u201cThey are so diligent.
