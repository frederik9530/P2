      "bodyText": "On a sunny Sydney afternoon, things look good from Sanjeev Gupta\u2019s office on the 28th floor. From one window you can see the $35m waterside mansion he bought last week as an Australian bolthole for his family; from the other, the south end of the Harbour Bridge looms large. But 1,500km west of Gupta\u2019s blindingly white office suite, at the Whyalla steel mill in South Australia, things are decidedly grittier. The mill, which was among assets the British billionaire bought from failed company Arrium in 2017 for about $750m, is losing money and even Gupta says it will require several years and hundreds of millions of dollars more before it turns a profit. \u201cIt\u2019s sub-scale and old technology \u2026 a tough steel market \u2013 these are all the ingredients for a problem,\u201d he says. Gupta has been feeling pressure over the way he has financed Whyalla and other businesses in an empire that employs about 45,000 people, including almost 7,000 in Australia, leading him to promise earlier this month to issue a consolidated set of numbers covering the whole enterprise. Whyalla sits at one end of a complex financial chain that stretches to Bundaberg in Queensland, back to Gupta\u2019s home base of London and off to Switzerland. Throw in Gupta\u2019s fight with Korea over allegations it is hurting Whyalla by dumping steel in Australia, questions about the level of government support his businesses need and a legal stoush involving former champion motorbike rider Mick Doohan and a $30m private jet, and he seems to have plenty on his plate. Some questions he clearly wishes would stop being asked. \u201cJournalists are annoying everywhere in the world, you\u2019re not unique,\u201d he jokes. But he\u2019s happy to talk about the troubles at the Whyalla mill. When he bought it, a little over two years ago, he was painted as the town\u2019s saviour. There was even a parade down the main street. Hundreds of workers at the mill agreed to take a pay cut to keep it going, and the South Australian government said it would give a $50m grant to whoever bought the ageing facility. As part of the deal, Gupta also got a business that recycles steel into building materials, which has been profitable even if it has also had some financial issues. Whyalla itself, Gupta says, has \u201cfundamental problems\u201d. OneSteel Manufacturing, the Gupta company which owns and operates the steel mill, lost $195m in the 2018 financial year, according to the most recent set of publicly available accounts, on top of a $120m loss the previous year. \u201cIt certainly clearly was in trouble when I first came to look at it,\u201d Gupta says. \u201cIn fact the very first discussions I had, they were very unfortunate, they were really about the fact that, OK, if it is going to die, how long is it going to take and what do you do with a town that has no other business? \u201cI have invested hundreds of millions of dollars trying to change that. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an easy answer \u2026 there is no thinking that you can wave a magic wand and you have a solution.\u201d His plans to upgrade the plant include a solar farm under construction in a joint venture with the former Rudd government adviser Ross Garnaut that Gupta says will be \u201cAustralia\u2019s biggest\u201d. He also wants to turn the mines that provide the mill its iron ore into pumped hydro power plants once they are tapped out. \u201cThese things don\u2019t get built in one day, it takes time for steel plants to be built or reformed,\u201d he says. \u2018Junk is just financial terminology\u2019 All this money has to come from somewhere, and so far much of Gupta\u2019s backing has come from Greensill Capital, a London-based finance house founded by a Bundaberg sugar cane and sweet potato farmer Lex Greensill, which has had its own share of controversies. Gupta says Greensill continues to finance the Whyalla mill and, until recently, also backed the steel recycling business Liberty Infrabuild. Greensill, which declined to comment on its relationship with Gupta, specialises in a form of lending known as \u201csupply chain finance\u201d, where it agrees to pay the suppliers of a business early in return for a cut of the invoices. Greensill has been embroiled in some controversy about loans it had bundled up and sold to investors in funds run by a Swiss group called Global Asset Management, but Gupta brushes aside any suggestion of implications for his companies. \u201cIt\u2019s not our business really,\u201d Gupta says. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong in it, it\u2019s perfectly good paper, it\u2019s a perfectly good asset.\u201d Meanwhile, Gupta\u2019s plans to list Liberty Infrabuild have been put on ice. He had recruited a board including the steel industry veteran Ray Horsburgh and cleaned up the company structure in preparation for an IPO this year. \u201cHe\u2019s doing well in getting the business to turn around and we felt, and I think the advisers felt, that he needed more mileage than one year\u2019s results,\u201d Horsburgh says. \u201cIt was stuffed and it\u2019s starting to make money.\u201d Until the middle of last month, Liberty Infrabuild also faced a potential debt crisis \u2013 one that Gupta had to reach into his own pockets to solve. On top of its financing from Greensill and another similar group, White Oak, it had borrowed $230m from the banks \u2013 and this needed to be paid back by February next year. Gupta initially proposed to fill the gap by borrowing US$475m in the form of high-interest bonds, but was forced to reduce this to US$375m and stump up an additional uS$150m of his own money to get the deal away. He says the money has been used to fix the company\u2019s finances, including by buying out Greensill, and it no longer needs to worry about the February deadline. The ratings agency Moody\u2019s slapped a Ba3 rating on the bonds, citing risks including \u201cthe concentrated ownership of the company\u201d, which could result in \u201ccash flow leakage to boost returns or support other businesses within GFG\u201d. Ba3 is what is politely called \u201cbelow investment grade\u201d or in the usual jargon of the market \u201cjunk\u201d \u2013 but the J-word sets Gupta off like a firecracker. \u201cFMG is junk,\u201d he says, referring to bonds issued by the Fortescue Metals group controlled by Australian mining magnate Andrew Forrest. \u201cNews Corp is one notch away from junk. This word junk is just financial terminology. Most of the universe you know of in this country in terms of heavy industry is going to be in that category. \u201cI think we\u2019re better than that, but it\u2019s the first rating we\u2019ve got so I\u2019m OK with that.\u201d \u2018My path is very clear\u2019 Gupta may have made nice with the capital markets, but he doesn\u2019t shy away from a fight. He has asked the Australian anti-dumping commission to investigate Japanese, Korean, Taiwanese and Thai steel mills he accuses of hurting Whyalla\u2019s profitability by offloading products in Australia at below what it costs them to produce. In a response filed with the commission last month, Korean steelmaker Hyundai sledged Gupta\u2019s companies for have an \u201copaque company structure\u201d and accused him of selling steel from one company in his group to another at a loss before selling it to customers at a profit. Gupta bristles. \u201cIt\u2019s nuts,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s none of their business almost \u2026 A foreign steel producer, what right do they even have to think about what we are doing here.\u201d It\u2019s also irrelevant, he says. \u201cThe dumping rules are about what price are they selling at here, versus what are they selling at in Korea.\u201d He also rejects notions he has asked for government handouts, saying that the $50m offered by South Australia \u2013 which the government says is yet to be handed over \u2013 was on offer to any successful bidder for Whyalla. This week, the Sydney Morning Herald reported he had asked the NSW state government for tax breaks on facilities in western Sydney. \u201cThe concept of governments generally, not this government in particular but any government, taxing something which is losing money or is bankrupt or has gone into trouble is crazy,\u201d Gupta says. Gupta has also found time to fight a jet sales company, Jetcraft, over a private plane he was going to buy in a deal brokered by Mick Doohan. In legal proceedings in the UK and the US, Gupta alleged Jetcraft inflated the price by interposing a company between him and the actual seller. But in June the high court of England and Wales ruled he had forfeited his US$2.5m deposit, and last month Gupta settled. \u201cIf I go to the toilet, it will probably be in the press next time,\u201d Gupta says when Guardian Australia raises the case. \u201cI tried to do an acquisition, there was an issue, it was settled, nothing happened.\u201d Gupta may not have bought the plane, but last week he did lay out a reported $35m to buy that mansion he can see from the window \u2013 Bomera, a colonial-era sandstone pile in the exclusive Sydney suburb of Potts Point. He says that after two years living here during the Arrium acquisition he loves the country \u2013 but he and his family are now based in London. There\u2019s something else Gupta wants to make clear: he doesn\u2019t care for the haters. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what schools of criticism or scepticism there is, there is no way I am going anywhere but where I exactly intended to,\u201d he says. \u201cI am not veering away from my path, my path is very clear in my mind.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Three rounds from the end of the $430,000 Fide/Chess.com Isle of Man event, chances of a bunch finish were growing as just half a point covered the leading 13 contenders, among them the world champion, Magnus Carlsen, and the world No 2, Fabiano Caruana. Top pairings in round nine (of 11) on Saturday are Levon Aronian (Armenia) v David Anton (Spain) and Carlsen (Norway) v Caruana (US). Anton, Aronian and Caruana are joint leaders with 6/8, followed by Carlsen and nine others on 5.5/8. The upset of Friday\u2019s eighth round was a crushing 24-move victory by Anton over the world-ranked Russian Alexander Grischuk, whose king was fatally exposed on an open board. Anton, 24, is ranked only No 52 in the world in the live ratings, but now takes on three of the top 10 elite. Carlsen and Caruana, who competed for the world crown in London last November, have both avoided defeat as a mixture of defensive skills and missed chances by their opponents in time pressure pulled them through. The champion had the luckier escape when his careless Sicilian allowed Vladislav Kovalev from Belarus a crushing central advantage with a passed d6 pawn supported by Qd5 and Ne4. How did Carlsen react to such a horrible position? \u201cHe reached for the rook, and then I saw oh, oh, Rae 1. He took a couple more minutes before he actually made the move and I am sitting there thinking. I have 1.30 on the clock and I am completely lost. I mean how can you be so dumb? Afterwards there were so many good continuations for him but he probably got nervous. Then he got low on time and then anything can happen.\u201d Resilient Carlsen got away with it and that seemed to spark his creative juices and a return to peak form. His next two wins were stylish and elegant, his confidence boosted because he had already defeated Surya Ganguly and Alexey Shirov as a teenager. After Friday\u2019s eighth round Carlsen\u2019s unbeaten streak reached 98 games, surpassing Mikhail Tal\u2019s 95 in 1973-74 and closing in on Ding Liren\u2019s record of 100 against high-level opponents.

Over this streak I\u2019ve shown very good resilience in defence, but I\u2019ve been lucky. My opponents have missed some pretty easy wins.\u201d Caruana\u2019s great escape came against Luke McShane in the fifth round. McShane drew his first game, then he followed up with three excellent wins from which his smooth victory over India\u2019s Baskaran Adhiban was the pick. The Englishman, whose main career has been in the City and is often called the world\u2019s strongest amateur, had a chance to become the clear leader on 4.5/5. He had a large advantage and missed several wins ranging from clear to complex, including the one in this week\u2019s puzzle. It would be stretching the story to say that with a clear lead McShane at age 35 could have gone on to qualify for the 2020 candidates, but the missed opportunities were a defining moment for his tournament. A loss to Wang Hao and a draw with Kovalev followed.

      "bodyText": "Frank Lampard has accused France of a lack of communication and criticised Didier Deschamps after N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 returned from international duty with an injury that will keep him out of Chelsea\u2019s game against Newcastle on Saturday. Kant\u00e9 has been plagued by fitness problems this season and the midfielder had to withdraw from the France side that beat Iceland in qualifying for Euro 2020 after suffering a groin injury during the warm-up. Lampard is fuming with France for making Kant\u00e9 sit on the bench against Turkey last Monday. The 28-year-old has struggled since suffering a knee injury this season and has also had ankle and hamstring problems during this campaign, restricting him to six appearances for his club. The midfielder is one of Chelsea\u2019s key players and Lampard asked Deschamps not to pick him during the September international break. That prompted the France manager to joke about Olivier Giroud\u2019s lack of games this season. Yet Lampard was less than amused when Kant\u00e9 was not sent home after the Iceland match and said Chelsea\u2019s doctors struggled to get information from their France counterparts. \u201cThe Kant\u00e9 one was not a laughing matter because we communicated before the last international break because he was injured,\u201d Chelsea\u2019s manager said. \u201cLet\u2019s think what benefits the player. He didn\u2019t go, we both agreed on that. That\u2019s how things should work. \u201cAfter the first game when he pulled out, he then had a fitness test the day before the second game; it was clear he couldn\u2019t play. He then sat on the bench on the evening of the game, so that\u2019s not communication \u2026 our doctors were speaking and there were times when things weren\u2019t coming back to us when I would expect them to.\u201d It was a costly international break for Chelsea, with Denmark\u2019s Andreas Christensen suffering a hamstring injury that will sideline him for two weeks and Croatia\u2019s Mateo Kovacic a doubt to face Newcastle because of a thigh problem. Lampard is annoyed his medical staff did not have longer to treat Kant\u00e9. \u201cWe got a player back a bit later,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand when players are on international duty, they are their player as such, but it was clear he wasn\u2019t fit to play. We would have wanted him back to work on him but it\u2019s been and gone and as with every international player I will try and have open lines of communication with every manager.\u201d Ross Barkley could benefit from Kant\u00e9\u2019s absence after impressing during England\u2019s 6-0 win over Bulgaria, scoring twice and grabbing an assist. \u201cI was loving his arrival into the box,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cIt\u2019s what you always want to get when you\u2019re playing midfielders with attacking qualities.

After clinching a last-minute deal in Brussels on Thursday by agreeing to a customs border in the Irish Sea, the prime minister had hoped to frame the rare Saturday sitting of parliament as a dramatic \u201cnew deal or no deal\u201d moment. But despite positive reactions from Bank of England governor Mark Carney and declarations of support from several Labour MPs, Johnson\u2019s plans were rocked on Friday by a cross-party group led by Oliver Letwin and Hilary Benn. The Conservative and Labour MPs will table an amendment allowing parliament to withhold its approval until the legislation to implement Brexit has passed. With Labour expected to back it, as well as rebel Conservatives including Philip Hammond and David Gauke, it appears likely to pass. Letwin has insisted that his plan is not to block a deal. But the move would mean that even if Johnson secured the support of a majority of MPs, he would fail to pass the test set by the Benn act for Brexit to go ahead by 31 October, which sets a deadline of 11pm on Saturday.

The scope for the Letwin amendment to succeed will partly be framed by the response of European leaders. Jean-Claude Juncker suggested in Brussels on Thursday that a request for an extension could be rejected \u2013 but other senior EU figures did not follow his lead. If the amendment passes, instead of a yes or no to Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal, MPs would then be given the opportunity of voting on the amended motion \u2013 which would say they have not yet approved the deal. Some of those backing the idea, including Letwin, would like to support Johnson\u2019s deal, but had become alarmed that it could pass on Saturday \u2013 allowing Johnson to escape the strictures of the backbench Benn act \u2013 but then fall at a later stage in the ratification process, leading to a no-deal Brexit. The move came as Johnson and his team launched a charm offensive, aimed at tempting potential waverers from across the political spectrum to support his agreement, which paves the way for a significantly looser future relationship with the EU. In a last-ditch attempt to win over vital Labour votes to secure his Brexit deal, he released fresh details of government commitments on workers\u2019 rights and environmental standards. He is also offering a parliamentary lock on the future partnership with EU which will allow MPs a vote on the government\u2019s negotiating objectives and a meaningful vote once talks have concluded. As part of his raft of new commitments, Johnson has promised to maintain high standards of workers\u2019 rights in the withdrawal agreement legislation when it goes before MPs. A minister would also have to explain to MPs where any new bill could affect employment rights and compatibility with the EU. There would be an obligation on the government to report regularly on new EU measures and whether it would mirror them. MPs would also get to vote on this report. In terms of environmental policy, Johnson has said he will look at cooperating with European agencies where it supports the national interest. He also pledged not to open up British markets for goods that do not meet the UK\u2019s high standards, and that the UK will not sign trade deals that export the environmental cost of its consumption to the rest of the world. A Downing Street spokesperson said: \u201cThe UK has a long and proud tradition of leading the way in workers\u2019 rights and environmental protections where we have always set a high standard. We recognise that MPs want to see these hard-won rights protected, not weakened by our departure from the EU.\u201d If the vote on Johnson\u2019s deal goes ahead without any amendments, the decision could be agonisingly tight, with the decisions of the handful of MPs yet to indicate a preference potentially swinging the result. With the threshold needed for a Commons majority of 320, once Sinn F\u00e9in MPs and the Speaker and his deputies are excluded, a Guardian tally of the two sides put them virtually neck and neck. A key constituency yet to declare was pro-deal Labour MPs informally led by Caroline Flint, who have been heavily courted by No 10. These calculations would be completely different if the Letwin amendment was to pass, with a series of potential opponents sufficiently reassured to back the government plan. However, on the other side of the equation, some hardline Tory Brexiters might become more wary of supporting a plan which would inevitably require another Brexit extension.",

      "bodyText": "Mauricio Pochettino believes Harry Kane is a natural leader and will not be weighed down by the responsibility of taking on the Tottenham captaincy. Kane, who has worn the armband at England level since May of last year, will captain his club in the absence of Hugo Lloris, who dislocated an elbow at Brighton two weeks ago. Lloris is not expected to return to training before the end of the year. Kane was praised for the maturity he showed on Monday when England twice stopped the play in their Euro 2020 qualifier against Bulgaria in Sofia after racist abuse. Pochettino believes Kane, who already shoulders the burden of being relied on to score Spurs\u2019s goals, will not be concerned by the pressure to lead them out of their slump. The team have won three matches this season and face Watford on Saturday with memories fresh of the 7-2 hammering by Bayern Munich and the 3-0 defeat at Brighton. \u201cHarry has become a natural leader,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cWe will miss Hugo for a few months and to have Harry step up is important. He does not need to feel too much pressure, just to act natural. When you do that, if you are a natural leader, you don\u2019t feel the responsibility. The problem is if you need to act. If you are not a real leader and you need to act, you spend energy thinking: \u2018How do I need to face this problem?\u2019\u201d The international break appears to have revitalised Pochettino, who projected positivity as he reflected on his involvement in Thursday\u2019s \u201cboxes\u201d drill in training. \u201cI am flying,\u201d he said. \u201cI played boxes for 10, 12 minutes and how many times did I go inside?

In the dressing room, that\u2019s the one advantage they have at the moment. And playing at home. It\u2019s like we have said: \u2018Here\u2019s the combined team\u2019 but we had nothing to do with it. I expected things like that this week but I was still surprised when I had a little look at the newspapers that the difference [between the teams] was that massive. I\u2019ve never seen a combined lineup like this but, in general, with the mood that these things create, yes I would use it.\u201d</p> <p>When asked to name one United player who would get in a combined team with Liverpool, however, Klopp chose the diplomatic line.</p> <p>\u201cI was always completely happy with my players and I don\u2019t look at other players,\u201d he replied. \u201cIf you asked me about Barcelona I will tell you the same. I don\u2019t want to have any Barcelona players in this specific Liverpool team at the moment.I am completely happy with my team. There\u2019s no difference \u2013 no Bayern player or Dortmund player, nothing \u2013 this is the team and I am completely happy with that.\u201d</p> <p>Klopp, meanwhile, has said it is unacceptable to force City to play twice in under 48 hours over the festive period due to television demands, but had rejected the champions\u2019 claims that December\u2019s schedule hands Liverpool an advantage in the title race. Liverpool have their own issues over Christmas with an 8pm kick-off at Leicester on Boxing Day, days after their return from the Club World Cup in Qatar, but Klopp has only sympathy for the demands placed on Pep Guardiola\u2019s players.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a game more in December than City. How can we have an advantage?\u201d he said. \u201cBut I am completely on City\u2019s side that these games where they have 46 hours between should not happen. It\u2019s like when we played Sunderland, it\u2019s just not OK. That was in 2016 and three years later we are still speaking about it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cNothing has changed.

We need to respect them to face the difficulties in the game and it will be there in the right way.\u201d Liverpool\u2019s victory over United at Anfield last season marked the end of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s reign but was also their only win in the last 10 league meetings between the clubs. Klopp admits he would try to turn the insults that Solskj\u00e6r has faced to his advantage were the roles reversed. The Liverpool manager added: \u201cYes I would [find the buildup insulting]. I saw all these things and it looks like they want to help Man United. All these articles look like they have been written by Man United supporters. \u201cWe\u2019ll live with it. In the dressing room, that\u2019s the one advantage they have at the moment. And playing at home. It\u2019s like we have said: \u2018Here\u2019s the combined team\u2019 but we had nothing to do with it. I expected things like that this week but I was still surprised when I had a little look at the newspapers that the difference [between the teams] was that massive. I\u2019ve never seen a combined lineup like this but, in general, with the mood that these things create, yes I would use it.\u201d When asked to name one United player who would get in a combined team with Liverpool, however, Klopp chose the diplomatic line. \u201cI was always completely happy with my players and I don\u2019t look at other players,\u201d he replied. \u201cIf you asked me about Barcelona I will tell you the same. I don\u2019t want to have any Barcelona players in this specific Liverpool team at the moment.I am completely happy with my team. There\u2019s no difference \u2013 no Bayern player or Dortmund player, nothing \u2013 this is the team and I am completely happy with that.\u201d Klopp, meanwhile, has said it is unacceptable to force City to play twice in under 48 hours over the festive period due to television demands, but had rejected the champions\u2019 claims that December\u2019s schedule hands Liverpool an advantage in the title race. Liverpool have their own issues over Christmas with an 8pm kick-off at Leicester on Boxing Day, days after their return from the Club World Cup in Qatar, but Klopp has only sympathy for the demands placed on Pep Guardiola\u2019s players. \u201cWe have a game more in December than City. How can we have an advantage?\u201d he said. \u201cBut I am completely on City\u2019s side that these games where they have 46 hours between should not happen. It\u2019s like when we played Sunderland, it\u2019s just not OK. That was in 2016 and three years later we are still speaking about it. \u201cNothing has changed. They [TV companies] pay a lot of money, that is true, but we still have to work on these things. Forty-eight hours between games is still pretty much unacceptable but less than 46 hours? I understand City [are unhappy] 100%.\u201d The Liverpool defender Jo\u00ebl Matip, meanwhile, has signed a new five-year contract with the club.",

It is one of the big reasons why England\u2019s coaches, the Wallabies result notwithstanding, think this team still have plenty more to come. Strange though it may sound, the Vunipolas are utterly convinced they perform better when both of them are on the field. \u201cIt definitely is a thing,\u201d Billy, 26, says. \u201cI enjoy having him around; he\u2019s like my shield. That\u2019s what big brothers do. I thoroughly enjoy playing with him and I\u2019m happy to see him back in the team.\u201d</p> <p>There are more practical reasons involved, too. With Mako, now 28, around, Billy feels under slightly less pressure to take on the world each and every time he carries the ball. \u201cSubconsciously it\u2019s not something we think about but having my brother there gives me a little more time. He takes away tension because he is as much of a [carrying] threat. It takes a lot of pressure off me. He\u2019s the older brother \u2026 anything that comes towards the Vunipolas he usually takes the brunt of it. I\u2019m always in the back just kicking back as younger brothers do.\u201d</p> <p>This fraternal bond is slightly more complicated off the field; like so many brothers, the Vunipolas tend to show their love for each other in different ways. \u201cWe have a funny relationship. Deep down we really love each other but he\u2019d never say anything to me. I always say it to him but he gets embarrassed and runs away. There is definitely that love and respect but we don\u2019t have to hang around and tell each other every day or every other minute how much we care for each other. It\u2019s just there. We don\u2019t hang out, unless his little boy is here. My nephew is what brings us together.\u201d</p> <p>Playing against one another also used to be problematic in the days before Billy switched from Wasps to join Mako at Saracens in 2013. \u201cIt was easier in the garden at home because we were brothers. On the pitch it was hard. I didn\u2019t want to tackle him, it felt really weird. I\u2019d rather be with him than against him. Unless we are playing video games \u2013 then I beat him all the time.\u201d</p> <p>The countdown clock, though, is ticking in real life. By the time the next World Cup comes around in France in 2023 both Vunipolas will be over 30. Tuilagi, 28, has already cast public doubt over whether his body will carry him through another World Cup campaign. If the three Pacific powerhouses are going to achieve something extra special together, the time to seize the day has arrived.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/17/teenager-jordan-petaia-australia-england-rugby-world-cup-quarter-final\">Cheika seeks World Cup masterstroke with teenager at centre against England</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A similar now-or-never imperative helped propel England\u2019s 2003 squad to their World Cup success. Not winning was completely unthinkable. Study the list of this century\u2019s Webb Ellis Cup winners and all have had uncompromising back-row triumvirates who simply refused to take no for an answer. Richard Hill, Neil Back and Lawrence Dallaglio in 2003, Schalk Burger, Juan Smith and Danie Rossouw in 2007, Jerome Kaino, Richie McCaw and Kieran Read in 2011 and 2015.

That\u2019s what we talked about, doing the hard yards, which I probably haven\u2019t been doing. I went from using no footwork to using a lot and now I think I need to go back.

I\u2019m always in the back just kicking back as younger brothers do.\u201d This fraternal bond is slightly more complicated off the field; like so many brothers, the Vunipolas tend to show their love for each other in different ways. \u201cWe have a funny relationship. Deep down we really love each other but he\u2019d never say anything to me. I always say it to him but he gets embarrassed and runs away. There is definitely that love and respect but we don\u2019t have to hang around and tell each other every day or every other minute how much we care for each other. It\u2019s just there. We don\u2019t hang out, unless his little boy is here. My nephew is what brings us together.\u201d Playing against one another also used to be problematic in the days before Billy switched from Wasps to join Mako at Saracens in 2013. \u201cIt was easier in the garden at home because we were brothers. On the pitch it was hard. I didn\u2019t want to tackle him, it felt really weird. I\u2019d rather be with him than against him. Unless we are playing video games \u2013 then I beat him all the time.\u201d The countdown clock, though, is ticking in real life. By the time the next World Cup comes around in France in 2023 both Vunipolas will be over 30. Tuilagi, 28, has already cast public doubt over whether his body will carry him through another World Cup campaign. If the three Pacific powerhouses are going to achieve something extra special together, the time to seize the day has arrived. A similar now-or-never imperative helped propel England\u2019s 2003 squad to their World Cup success. Not winning was completely unthinkable. Study the list of this century\u2019s Webb Ellis Cup winners and all have had uncompromising back-row triumvirates who simply refused to take no for an answer. Richard Hill, Neil Back and Lawrence Dallaglio in 2003, Schalk Burger, Juan Smith and Danie Rossouw in 2007, Jerome Kaino, Richie McCaw and Kieran Read in 2011 and 2015. Maybe it is unrealistic to expect the more youthful Tom Curry and Sam Underhill to help Vunipola scale similar heights in Japan but, if England are truly aiming high, there is little other option. It explains why Vunipola openly concedes the management have told him he needs to up his game and be more direct when carrying, rather than sidestepping before contact. \u201cAt the moment I\u2019m not doing any tough carries. That\u2019s what we talked about, doing the hard yards, which I probably haven\u2019t been doing. I went from using no footwork to using a lot and now I think I need to go back. Hopefully that\u2019ll create space for me to use footwork later.\u201d If England end up faltering at this World Cup a lack of collective desire will not be the reason why.",

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s negotiations with Timor-Leste should be the subject of a royal commission, and the government should return $5bn unfairly taken from the impoverished nation, a parliamentary inquiry has been told. It should also drop the prosecution of Witness K and Bernard Collaery, who revealed the now infamous bugging of Timorese delegates during negotiations on what became the CMATS treaty. A Senate standing committee is examining decisions made by Australia in 2002, amid fractious maritime border negotiations with Timor-Leste, to withdraw from the jurisdictions of the International Tribunal of the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) and the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Among the seven published submissions \u2013 none of which come from the Australian government \u2013 high profile Timorese organisations, allies and academics, supported the return, and called on Australia to be held accountable for its conduct. Steve Bracks, the former Victorian premier and formal adviser to the Timorese government, said in his submission the conduct of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in its negotiations with Timor-Leste should be examined by a royal commission. Australia has a long history of controversial dealings with Timor-Leste, including spying on Timorese representatives during treaty negotiations and recent revelations that successive Australian governments were driven by a desire for resources when legitimising the Indonesian invasion. When Timor-Leste regained independence, leaving open a border which had previously been subject to a treaty with Indonesia, Australia controversially pushed for the new maritime border which gave it a greater share than Timor-Leste of the lucrative oil and gas fields in the region. Sixteen years later, in March 2018, the two countries finally signed a treaty which essentially followed the median line first envisioned as a fair demarcation years earlier. Bracks said the Australian government \u2013 led at the time by John Howard and with Alexander Downer as foreign affairs minister \u2013 could have \u201cconsolidated Australia\u2019s relationship with a close, strategically placed neighbour\u201d, if it had acknowledged a fair maritime border from the start. Instead Australia \u201cput short-term economic interests above long-term international gain\u201d. \u201cDuring that 16 years, while Timor-Leste was dealing with the aftermath of a brutal 24 year occupation and struggling to build a new nation,\u201d Bracks said. \u201cThe oil and gas reserves in the Timor Sea were the only significant revenue source available to them.\u201d Dili-based human rights and economic analysis group L\u2019ao Hamutuk estimated Australia had taken more than US$5bn in oil and gas revenue since 2002 from reserves which both countries now acknowledge were always in an independent Timor-Leste\u2019s territory.

It\u2019s hard not to be cynical that Australia is just picking and choosing when to abide by international law.\u201d Submissions also called for the government to drop the prosecutions of Witness K and Bernard Collaery. Bracks and academic Clinton Fernandes noted it occurred around the time that Jemaah Islamiyah terrorists bombed Australia\u2019s embassy in Jakarta. \u201cSurely our Asis resources should have been targeting the \u2018war on terror\u2019, and not facilitating Australia\u2019s economic exploitation of a friendly, desperately poor and recently traumatised neighbour?\u201d Bracks said. Timor-Leste later sought to have the CMATS treaty terminated by the Hague after the bugging operation was revealed in 2013, but Witness K was prevented by Australia from attending the hearing to give evidence, and both he and Collaery have faced charges in extraordinarily controversial circumstances. Bracks said he had \u201cno doubt\u201d that Xanana Gusmao would not have signed the treaty had he known Witness K and Collaery would be charged soon after. Submissions to the inquiry have closed, although requests for an extension can be made. A report is expected on 28 November.",

Ngata has been sober for 22 years, something Chaplin is very proud of him for: \u201cHe was unreliable before that but when he gave up drinking, he got reliable and mature.\u201d</p> <p>It had been a long time coming, Ngata says. \u201cI was kind of failing at a lot of things in that time. So it was my rock bottom. It was time to make that decision and I did, and stuck with it.\u201d His life improved dramatically. \u201cI think, too, it was having someone who was on your side, [who] gave you the courage to push forward.\u201d</p> <p>Not long after that, Ngata quit his job and the pair decided to open their own salon. \u201cWe always knew that we wanted to work together,\u201d Chaplin says. Although he kept his job at Amnesty International while they waited for the business to grow, it didn\u2019t take long.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d6d8c307ecef022f4a656dbc9e94fd105f5e1a79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6d8c307ecef022f4a656dbc9e94fd105f5e1a79/0_157_3024_2706/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Glenn Chaplin and Brad Ngata at Mardi Gras in their early days together\" width=\"1000\" height=\"895\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Mardi Gras embrace during their early days together</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Glenn Chaplin &amp; Brad Ngata</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt pretty much exploded, in a good way,\u201d Ngata says. \u201cWe [were] quite ambitious in that way, so there was a lot of building, and then we doubled the size of the salon, and then [we were] winning awards, we had a lot of PR. Everything was happening.\u201d</p> <p>That was a heady time in the Australian fashion world, and the couple and their downtown Sydney salon were at the centre of the storm. They were connected to everyone \u2013 designers including Ksubi, Sass &amp; Bide and Fleur Wood \u2013 and Ngata juggled runway looks with celebrity haircuts while Chaplin ran the business and produced the shows. They travelled the world together and, in 2012, opened a second salon in the city. The pair were together all day every day and there was rarely an escape from work pressures. \u201cThere\u2019s been incredible highs and then incredibly challenging times, but I think we couldn\u2019t have gotten through it if we couldn\u2019t rely on each other,\u201d Ngata says.</p> <p>About 10 years ago, they visited a life coach \u2013 a step they recommend to other couples. Ngata says: \u201c[Sometimes] you need that third person, who understands how to get the best result on all different kinds of levels, and to be that third person where you\u2019re in a safe place. You can have relationship hygiene, talk about [things], say it, get it out and then get really good advice and tools to try and fix it somehow.\u201d The coach helped them to get insight into what makes the other tick. They went to her for four years: \u201cThat was probably the best thing we did because we didn\u2019t realise how we both grew as individuals from doing that,\u201d Chaplin says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/oct/05/how-we-stay-together-productive-conflict-commitment-and-48-hour-holidays\">How we stay together: productive conflict, commitment and 48-hour holidays</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A few years later they decided to step out of the fashion whirl and downsize to a single, smaller salon in Darlinghurst, just as luxurious but much more relaxed. They also split their time between Sydney and a home in the Blue Mountains. \u201cWe moved there to have a quieter life, and get Glenn into a garden because that helps to de-stress him.\u201d</p> <p>Getting out of the city each week gives them time to reconnect to one another. \u201c[I realise] how important that is to us, to have that downtime, because you jump in the car, you go over the Anzac bridge, and that\u2019s it. Everything, it can all wait until Wednesday. And that\u2019s something that we afford ourselves the luxury of having, even though we work hard to keep it.\u201d</p> <p>Being away from the hustle of the city has strengthened their bond and the house gives them space to do their own thing. \u201cI always say the ideal for me is to know that Brad\u2019s there, but in the other room,\u201d says Chaplin, with a laugh.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f975ae89101c0e8d4ecabe9d76ed293929375b24\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f975ae89101c0e8d4ecabe9d76ed293929375b24/0_0_960_565/500.jpg\" alt=\"Chaplin and Ngata at their Sydney salon\" width=\"500\" height=\"294\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chaplin and Ngata at their Sydney salon</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Glenn Chaplin &amp; Brad Ngata</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Next year they\u2019ll celebrate 25 years together and they plan to finally tie the knot.

Ngata has been sober for 22 years, something Chaplin is very proud of him for: \u201cHe was unreliable before that but when he gave up drinking, he got reliable and mature.\u201d It had been a long time coming, Ngata says. \u201cI was kind of failing at a lot of things in that time. So it was my rock bottom. It was time to make that decision and I did, and stuck with it.\u201d His life improved dramatically. \u201cI think, too, it was having someone who was on your side, [who] gave you the courage to push forward.\u201d Not long after that, Ngata quit his job and the pair decided to open their own salon. \u201cWe always knew that we wanted to work together,\u201d Chaplin says. Although he kept his job at Amnesty International while they waited for the business to grow, it didn\u2019t take long. \u201cIt pretty much exploded, in a good way,\u201d Ngata says. \u201cWe [were] quite ambitious in that way, so there was a lot of building, and then we doubled the size of the salon, and then [we were] winning awards, we had a lot of PR. Everything was happening.\u201d That was a heady time in the Australian fashion world, and the couple and their downtown Sydney salon were at the centre of the storm. They were connected to everyone \u2013 designers including Ksubi, Sass &amp; Bide and Fleur Wood \u2013 and Ngata juggled runway looks with celebrity haircuts while Chaplin ran the business and produced the shows. They travelled the world together and, in 2012, opened a second salon in the city. The pair were together all day every day and there was rarely an escape from work pressures. \u201cThere\u2019s been incredible highs and then incredibly challenging times, but I think we couldn\u2019t have gotten through it if we couldn\u2019t rely on each other,\u201d Ngata says. About 10 years ago, they visited a life coach \u2013 a step they recommend to other couples. Ngata says: \u201c[Sometimes] you need that third person, who understands how to get the best result on all different kinds of levels, and to be that third person where you\u2019re in a safe place. You can have relationship hygiene, talk about [things], say it, get it out and then get really good advice and tools to try and fix it somehow.\u201d The coach helped them to get insight into what makes the other tick. They went to her for four years: \u201cThat was probably the best thing we did because we didn\u2019t realise how we both grew as individuals from doing that,\u201d Chaplin says. A few years later they decided to step out of the fashion whirl and downsize to a single, smaller salon in Darlinghurst, just as luxurious but much more relaxed. They also split their time between Sydney and a home in the Blue Mountains. \u201cWe moved there to have a quieter life, and get Glenn into a garden because that helps to de-stress him.\u201d Getting out of the city each week gives them time to reconnect to one another. \u201c[I realise] how important that is to us, to have that downtime, because you jump in the car, you go over the Anzac bridge, and that\u2019s it. Everything, it can all wait until Wednesday. And that\u2019s something that we afford ourselves the luxury of having, even though we work hard to keep it.\u201d Being away from the hustle of the city has strengthened their bond and the house gives them space to do their own thing. \u201cI always say the ideal for me is to know that Brad\u2019s there, but in the other room,\u201d says Chaplin, with a laugh. Next year they\u2019ll celebrate 25 years together and they plan to finally tie the knot. The passing of the marriage equality bill in 2017 was significant for them and they want to make things official. \u201cWe know how committed we are and, given 25 years, we\u2019re very committed,\u201d Chaplin says, \u201cbut I think that just signals it to everyone else.\u201d Ngata jokes: \u201cMy straight clients say to me, get married, be miserable!\u201d So what\u2019s their secret for staying together? \u201cI think you\u2019ve got to get on with it,\u201d says Ngata, \u201cbecause if you don\u2019t, then there\u2019s no point. [And] you\u2019ve got to communicate. That took a lot of therapy to get to that point: Open your heart was what I\u2019ve been told to do. Face the fear and do it anyway. Just step over that line.\u201d Through everything, their commitment to each other hasn\u2019t wavered. They\u2019re in it for the long haul, Ngata says. \u201cThere\u2019s good times and there\u2019s bad times, as much as a cliche as that sounds. But ... Glenn was there when I was going through a pretty dark period. So I\u2019m there for him when he\u2019s going through a period for him \u2026 You\u2019ve got to look at the whole history of your relationship and not just be defined by one moment in it.\u201d Chaplin agrees: \u201cNever does it cross your mind in a serious way that you\u2019d leave each other. You just bear with whatever you\u2019re going through and you know that, ultimately, it\u2019s going to be fixed and it\u2019ll all come good again, and you trust that.\u201d \u2022 We want to hear your stories about staying together.

The office of the Australian information commissioner (OAIC) is leading the local response to revelations that Cambridge Analytica gained unauthorised access to the profiles and data of 87 million Facebook users, including 300,000 in Australia. The Cambridge Analytica breach, revealed by the Observer, prompted law firm Johnson Winter &amp; Slattery and litigation funders IMF Bentham to lodge a representative complaint on behalf of affected Australian users in April last year.

From the outset, the OAIC publicly flagged the possibility of seeking court-mandated fines against Facebook or compelling the company to submit to enforceable undertakings.

But if there was an animal or a bird I just zoned in. I imagined their stories and their lives. I always saw them and I saw their characters.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2017/oct/26/reconsidering-the-pigeon-in-pictures-leila-jeffreys\">The rebirth of coo: reconsidering the pigeon \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Jeffreys, 47, has made a career photographing birds. But her work is a far cry from nature photography. She shoots the animals, often sourced from wildlife rescue centres, zoos or individual homes in a studio, creating human-style portraits of black cockatoos, tawny owls, pink pigeons and golden finches.</p> \n<p>Human portraiture, she insists, \u201cshows the characters of each particular animal. Birds are incredibly beautiful if you stop and pay attention.\u201d</p> \n<p>Jeffreys is holding her first exhibition in Australia in five years. High Society, which opens at Sydney\u2019s Olsen Gallery this month before travelling to New York in November, focuses exclusively on budgerigars. And although there are still the portraits that made her name, this time she is trying something new: shooting entire flocks.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a81c9b5d-85ce-4144-bab5-f013a06102ce\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/04DQOXb9clU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>For the photos, 300 budgerigars sourced from different owners were brought into an aviary in a studio. They were then separated by colour and allowed to perch on the branches of sculptural looking dead trees. Shot against a white background, the birds look like a sprinkling of delicate yellow, green or blue leaves.</p> \n<p>The budgerigars were tame. \u201cI wanted to work with birds I knew would be happy and calm and easy.\u201d Still there were challenges posed by the sheer numbers of her subjects. Jeffreys went through 20kg of birdseed, and she had to paint each bird\u2019s toenail with different nail polish in order to identify them.</p> \n<p>The resulting images \u2013 ethereal and architectural \u2013 are visually gorgeous. But there is also a larger message about the environment: \u201cThere is this symbiotic relationship between birds and trees. Trees need birds because they pollinate, and birds need trees because it\u2019s shelter, it\u2019s a food source.\u201d</p> \n<p>Loss of habitat is threatening that relationship: \u201cYou remove that tree, you remove a whole society of a different species.\u201d</p> \n<p>For Jeffreys, budgerigars also reference humankind\u2019s guiding hand in evolution.

      "bodyText": "Growing up in India to an Indian mother and Anglo-Australian father, the artist Leila Jeffreys found herself drawn to the myriad rainbow-coloured birds. \u201cI was a real dreamer,\u201d she recalls over tea in Sydney, where she lives with her husband, son and dog, Ronnie Barker. \u201cWe travelled a lot and I never really knew the names of the places we went to. But if there was an animal or a bird I just zoned in. I imagined their stories and their lives. I always saw them and I saw their characters.\u201d Jeffreys, 47, has made a career photographing birds. But her work is a far cry from nature photography. She shoots the animals, often sourced from wildlife rescue centres, zoos or individual homes in a studio, creating human-style portraits of black cockatoos, tawny owls, pink pigeons and golden finches. Human portraiture, she insists, \u201cshows the characters of each particular animal. Birds are incredibly beautiful if you stop and pay attention.\u201d Jeffreys is holding her first exhibition in Australia in five years. High Society, which opens at Sydney\u2019s Olsen Gallery this month before travelling to New York in November, focuses exclusively on budgerigars. And although there are still the portraits that made her name, this time she is trying something new: shooting entire flocks. For the photos, 300 budgerigars sourced from different owners were brought into an aviary in a studio. They were then separated by colour and allowed to perch on the branches of sculptural looking dead trees. Shot against a white background, the birds look like a sprinkling of delicate yellow, green or blue leaves. The budgerigars were tame. \u201cI wanted to work with birds I knew would be happy and calm and easy.\u201d Still there were challenges posed by the sheer numbers of her subjects. Jeffreys went through 20kg of birdseed, and she had to paint each bird\u2019s toenail with different nail polish in order to identify them. The resulting images \u2013 ethereal and architectural \u2013 are visually gorgeous. But there is also a larger message about the environment: \u201cThere is this symbiotic relationship between birds and trees. Trees need birds because they pollinate, and birds need trees because it\u2019s shelter, it\u2019s a food source.\u201d Loss of habitat is threatening that relationship: \u201cYou remove that tree, you remove a whole society of a different species.\u201d For Jeffreys, budgerigars also reference humankind\u2019s guiding hand in evolution. Native to Australia, \u201cBudgies in the wild are only green and gold and live in flocks of tens of thousands,\u201d she says. \u201cThen they\u2019ve been brought into aviaries and bred and other colour mutations comes out.\u201d So with the 2019 Guardian/Bird Life Australia bird of the year launching on 28 October, which is her favourite Australian bird? Jeffreys winces. \u201cThat is not an easy decision!\u201d She finally settles on the forest red-tailed black cockatoo, found in Western Australia, where she owns a block of bush land. \u201cI\u2019ve been camping there since I was a kid and the call of those birds are just embedded in my brain,\u201d she says. \u201cI go at night. The sky is black and the stars are bright and I hear the birds calling.\u201d Next Jeffreys will do a series on seabirds. She has just returned from an expedition to the Arctic Circle. Although she shoots in studios, seeing birds in their natural environment is critical to her work. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to do a story on seabirds, I really think you need to get to the remote places they\u2019re living and experience that life,\u201d she says. \u201cThere is an energy that exists in the wild; it has a different pulse.\u201d \u2022 Leila Jeffreys\u2019 High Society is on exhibition from Wednesday 16 October until Saturday 9 November at the Olsen Gallery, Woollahra. Bird Nerd: The Art Of Leila Jeffreys is now available on ABC iView. A screening and Q&amp;A event will take place on Saturday 19 October between 6-8pm at the gallery. Visit olsengallery.com.",

It\u2019s important to grasp he\u2019s a product of his age.</p> <p>I spent time this week watching Morrison thundering away at the dispatch box with parliament back in session, watching him work, trying to pinpoint exactly how he is different from his predecessors.</p> <p>The first thing to observe is he speaks predominantly to disengaged voters. Apart from the empathy offensive underway in the bush on drought (which on some internal views is cunning crowding out of Nationals and on other views helping Nationals) Morrison doesn\u2019t need to rally or mollify the base, at least not yet, because he has one palpable advantage: he is not Malcolm Turnbull.</p> <p>Morrison doesn\u2019t need to waste energy signalling to engaged fellow travellers that he is one of them, as Turnbull had to do more or less constantly, <a href=\"https://meanjin.com.au/essays/prime-minister-disrupted/\">eroding the life force of his prime ministership</a> genuflection by genuflection, because they already know that.

At the end of the day, once those awarded a second chance have been led away, the dealers open the remaining pens and run their unlucky purchases through the saleyard to the loading ramp. Young, well-fed, well-muscled horses \u2013 such as thoroughbreds or standardbreds that have recently left the racing industries \u2013 are sent to export abattoirs in Peterborough, South Australia, or the Meramist abattoir in Caboolture, Queensland. The latter is currently being investigated for animal cruelty offences after footage aired on the ABC\u2019s 7.30 program showed horses being shocked with electric prods, hit and kicked before slaughter. The racing industry has reacted with shock and indignation, as has the public. The censure from both extends not just to alleged breaches of animal welfare laws at the abattoir, which the Queensland government has said it will investigate, but to the mere fact of horses being slaughtered. The slaughter of horses is legal in Australia and governed by the national standards that cover all animal slaughter, as well as industry codes of practice and state-based animal welfare legislation. Export abattoirs such as Meramist must also comply with European Union rules around animal welfare, including those banning the use of the electric prodders on horses, and are required to have an Australian government vet on site while slaughter is taking place. The RSPCA has called on the department to investigate whether all Australian standards were followed. But while the slaughter of horses through methods identical to those used to slaughter cattle or sheep is ethically no different, it has caused significantly more upset. For proof, look no further than the reaction to recent animal welfare protests at abattoirs. Some of the same state governments that scorned those protests have now called for an inquiry into horse deaths and what responsibility, if any, should be borne by the racing industry. First, the racing industry must acknowledge that it cannot be absolved from responsibility for what happens to horses it bred for profit. It must also acknowledge statistics it puts forward about the fate of racehorses after retirement are at best misleading. According to an estimate by the Coalition for the Protection of Racehorses, which undertook part of the 7.30 investigation, about 4,000 thoroughbreds a year were slaughtered at Meramist alone. However, Racing Australia continues to state that less than 1% of all retired horses go to slaughter and another 1% are sent to livestock sales. Those proportions are set out in its annual report but the raw numbers are not stated. It also only records a horse\u2019s first destination after it finishes racing, so if they are on-sold to slaughter it\u2019s not tracked. And everyone with even a passing knowledge of horses knows that once a horse retires from or fails at its original purpose, or the purpose for which it has been retrained, it is traded off as a depreciating asset, losing value and prospects with each transaction until another use can be found. In short: the racing industry does not know where most horses end up. That is why a Senate committee is investigating possible models for a national horse traceability register. The inquiry is due to report in December, and followed a report by Guardian Australia in 2018 detailing a day at the saleyards in Echuca, in which 10 of the 33 horses of racing breeds (thoroughbred and standardbred) were bought by a buyer supplying the export abattoirs. Without a national tracking system, Australia cannot hope to know how many horses of each type are slaughtered annually and how they ended up in the knocking box. In South Korea, where at least 30% of Australian racehorses imported in the past five years have ended up in slaughter, as Guardian Australia reported in June, deaths are noted in the public racehorse database. In Australia, this information only comes to light in investigations by media or animal welfare groups. The absence of a traceability scheme also leaves Australia vulnerable to biosecurity threats such as equine influenza. A 2007 outbreak cost the federal government $108m and proved that most recreational horse owners were unaware of requirements to inform authorities of all livestock on their property. There is, in the submissions to the Senate inquiry, near universal support for the idea of a traceability scheme, provided someone else is paying for it.

The footage was played for the royal commissioners but the sisters did not want it made public. It revealed staff grabbing their father\u2019s legs and ordering him to \u201cstop shaking\u201d, even though his Parkinson\u2019s disease meant this was beyond his control. His shaking would also set off the night alarm, which she said would further irritate staff, with one of them telling him, \u201cI\u2019m sick of this\u201d.</p> <p>The footage also shows a staff member attempting to get their father out of bed using a lifting machine. When their father collapses, a staff member taps his face and, when he appears not to respond, puts him back to bed and walks away.</p> <p>When Nisi and Lynch\u2019s father was given a palliative care regime, they say none of the staff told them that this meant their father was dying and that they should prepare to say goodbye.

Nisi and Lynch at times needed to pause to regain their composure as they told the commissioners of how their father rapidly deteriorated in his final weeks. They said the home could not even tell them his exact time of death.</p> <p>After their father died and the sisters handed the footage over to the facility on a USB stick, they claim no action was taken. Lynch said she then took it to the CEO, who confirmed he had already seen the footage. The commission heard he later emailed her to tell her she had broken the law by installing the camera.</p> <p>\u201cHe was more interested in our usage of the camera than what happened,\u201d Lynch said.

Qualifications in the sector vary greatly, the commission heard. A worker in the home-care sector, Janice Hilton, said unregulated and untrained workers could \u201cwalk in off the street\u201d and into caring roles.</p> <p>\u201cThere are a lot of fly-by-night providers starting businesses in the sector,\u201d she said. \u201cThere needs to be a closer look at these providers and penalties for people who break those codes or standards.\u201d</p> <p>Health Workers Union representative Lisa Alcock said staff endured being assaulted and sexually assaulted \u201con a weekly basis\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe two most critical pieces of feedback that we receive from members on a daily basis is the alarming rate of occupational violence, and that is just something you have to accept when you work in aged care,\u201d she said. \u201cThe second is that the incredibly low rate of pay is something that you have to similarly accept. It\u2019s hard to accept because I feel that you can\u2019t have a high quality of care if you have workers working poor and working them into poverty essentially.\u201d</p> <p>The commission heard this was exacerbated by the demands on staff, with one registered nurse being responsible for upwards of 50 patients, including high-care dementia patients.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve heard some evidence about graduate or first-year nurses coming in and being expected to run or be in charge of facilities, some even being referred to as clinical care managers,\u201d Bolster said.</p> <p>The commission was told this was particularly concerning given the added pressures expected on the system in the coming decades.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email\">Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Morning mail\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4148\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia's Morning Mail\" data-form-description=\"Get our editors' pick of the biggest headlines every weekday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The Australian Bureau of Statistics predicts that by 2050 the population of people aged between one and 18 will be 7.8m and the population of those aged 65 and over will be roughly the same. At the moment there are 5.5m people aged 18 and under, compared with 3.9m for the over 65s. This demographic shift will further imperil a struggling system. The aged care workforce is ageing, the commission has heard, struggling to retain existing staff or attract graduates to the sector.</p> <p>Professor James Vickers, from the University of Tasmania\u2019s Wicking Dementia Research and Education Centre said the ageing population would also be higher-need, with dementia to overtake heart disease as the leading cause of death of Australians in about five years time. It is already the leading cause of death of women.</p> <p>In order to avoid the poor care experienced by Lynch and Nisi\u2019s father, Vickers told the commission: \u201cWe really need an emergency reaction to upskill the current health workforce working in aged care in dementia, and then we also need to make sure that we have relevant content in those health professional programs for people who will end up working with older people\u201d.</p> <p>The commission\u2019s hearings coincided with the release of a report by Human Rights Watch titled <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2019/10/15/fading-away/how-aged-care-facilities-australia-chemically-restrain-older-people\">Fading Away: How Aged Care Facilities in Australia Chemically Restrain Older People with Dementia</a>. The report found aged care facilities routinely used drugs to control behaviour, a practice known as chemical restraint. Many of the drugs were not approved for use in people dementia and carried an increased risk of death. The report is based on interviews with family members, doctors, nurses, and advocates, and documents the use of medications as chemical restraint in 35 aged care facilities.</p> <p>An author of the report, Bethany Brown, said older people, and especially those with dementia, needed care and support, not restraint, even when they became agitated. But this required having a skilled and supported staff.</p> <p><strong>\u201c</strong>When someone\u2019s rights are being violated the buck stops with the government to put in place a system that will prevent it from happening,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWhat we want to see is a prohibition on the use of chemical restraints in aged care and enough staff to help people and give them the support that they need. They should not be routinely given drugs for the convenience of staff. These drugs increase the risk of falls, of stroke and death, they change personalities. Their family members who often have power of attorney aren\u2019t even being informed that these drugs are being given.\u201d</p> <p>Brown added that the Human Rights Watch report and even the royal commission were not necessarily hearing of the worst cases in aged care, because many of those abused had no one.</p> <p><strong>\u201c</strong>We are scratching the surface,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are seeing and hearing the experiences of the ones in aged care with loved ones checking in. And family and friends can find it hard to stand up to medical establishments, because they are fearful of repercussions for their loved one in care.\u201d</p> <p><em>The royal commission hearings continue from 4 November in Mudgee, NSW.</em></p> <p><strong>\u2022 </strong><em><a href=\"https://www.beyondblue.org.au/\">Beyond Blue Support Service</a> \u2013 phone 1300 224 636. <a href=\"https://www.dementia.org.au/helpline/\">The National Dementia Helpline</a> \u2013 free call 1800 100 500.

A doctor wrote up a number of palliative medications to be given to relieve pain if needed. \u201cSadly, however, the palliative care plan was never activated, and he was not receiving palliative care at the time of his death,\u201d counsel assisting the commission, Paul Bolster, said. Nisi and Lynch at times needed to pause to regain their composure as they told the commissioners of how their father rapidly deteriorated in his final weeks. They said the home could not even tell them his exact time of death. After their father died and the sisters handed the footage over to the facility on a USB stick, they claim no action was taken. Lynch said she then took it to the CEO, who confirmed he had already seen the footage. The commission heard he later emailed her to tell her she had broken the law by installing the camera. \u201cHe was more interested in our usage of the camera than what happened,\u201d Lynch said. The staff who were shown to grab and shake their father were not fired, the commission heard. Bolster told the commissioners these incidents \u201cwere just the tip of the iceberg\u201d. On Wednesday the royal commission heard about the pressures on staff in the aged care sector, who are commonly paid less than a checkout operator. Qualifications in the sector vary greatly, the commission heard. A worker in the home-care sector, Janice Hilton, said unregulated and untrained workers could \u201cwalk in off the street\u201d and into caring roles. \u201cThere are a lot of fly-by-night providers starting businesses in the sector,\u201d she said. \u201cThere needs to be a closer look at these providers and penalties for people who break those codes or standards.\u201d Health Workers Union representative Lisa Alcock said staff endured being assaulted and sexually assaulted \u201con a weekly basis\u201d. \u201cThe two most critical pieces of feedback that we receive from members on a daily basis is the alarming rate of occupational violence, and that is just something you have to accept when you work in aged care,\u201d she said. \u201cThe second is that the incredibly low rate of pay is something that you have to similarly accept. It\u2019s hard to accept because I feel that you can\u2019t have a high quality of care if you have workers working poor and working them into poverty essentially.\u201d The commission heard this was exacerbated by the demands on staff, with one registered nurse being responsible for upwards of 50 patients, including high-care dementia patients. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard some evidence about graduate or first-year nurses coming in and being expected to run or be in charge of facilities, some even being referred to as clinical care managers,\u201d Bolster said. The commission was told this was particularly concerning given the added pressures expected on the system in the coming decades. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Australian Bureau of Statistics predicts that by 2050 the population of people aged between one and 18 will be 7.8m and the population of those aged 65 and over will be roughly the same. At the moment there are 5.5m people aged 18 and under, compared with 3.9m for the over 65s. This demographic shift will further imperil a struggling system. The aged care workforce is ageing, the commission has heard, struggling to retain existing staff or attract graduates to the sector. Professor James Vickers, from the University of Tasmania\u2019s Wicking Dementia Research and Education Centre said the ageing population would also be higher-need, with dementia to overtake heart disease as the leading cause of death of Australians in about five years time. It is already the leading cause of death of women. In order to avoid the poor care experienced by Lynch and Nisi\u2019s father, Vickers told the commission: \u201cWe really need an emergency reaction to upskill the current health workforce working in aged care in dementia, and then we also need to make sure that we have relevant content in those health professional programs for people who will end up working with older people\u201d. The commission\u2019s hearings coincided with the release of a report by Human Rights Watch titled Fading Away: How Aged Care Facilities in Australia Chemically Restrain Older People with Dementia. The report found aged care facilities routinely used drugs to control behaviour, a practice known as chemical restraint. Many of the drugs were not approved for use in people dementia and carried an increased risk of death. The report is based on interviews with family members, doctors, nurses, and advocates, and documents the use of medications as chemical restraint in 35 aged care facilities. An author of the report, Bethany Brown, said older people, and especially those with dementia, needed care and support, not restraint, even when they became agitated. But this required having a skilled and supported staff. \u201cWhen someone\u2019s rights are being violated the buck stops with the government to put in place a system that will prevent it from happening,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWhat we want to see is a prohibition on the use of chemical restraints in aged care and enough staff to help people and give them the support that they need. They should not be routinely given drugs for the convenience of staff. These drugs increase the risk of falls, of stroke and death, they change personalities. Their family members who often have power of attorney aren\u2019t even being informed that these drugs are being given.\u201d Brown added that the Human Rights Watch report and even the royal commission were not necessarily hearing of the worst cases in aged care, because many of those abused had no one. \u201cWe are scratching the surface,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are seeing and hearing the experiences of the ones in aged care with loved ones checking in. And family and friends can find it hard to stand up to medical establishments, because they are fearful of repercussions for their loved one in care.\u201d The royal commission hearings continue from 4 November in Mudgee, NSW. \u2022 Beyond Blue Support Service \u2013 phone 1300 224 636.

Real Madrid and Juventus have let it be known, through the usual channels, that they may just be coming for Kant\u00e9. Not that anyone really believes these stories, product of what the authors of The Club, a brilliantly detailed anatomy of Premier League shenanigans, describe as \u201cthe gossip-industrial complex\u201d.</p> <p>There are obvious holes in the Kant\u00e9 to Madrid yarn.

In Kant\u00e9 we got it, a defensive shield of such energy, with such a flatteringly concussive Premier League style that it became a badge of sophistication to praise him and a possible source of that backlash when a gangly foreign manager who looks as though he\u2019s stepped out to the all-night garage in search of a tin of slim panatellas tried to change him, to bring other layers out of a champion footballer.</p> <p>It is fair to ask why bother. Kant\u00e9 is seriously good at this. He made the most tackles in Europe\u2019s top leagues two seasons in a row. Last season, in a team that had the ball most of the time, he still blocked more passes per game than any other regular Premier League midfielder.</p> <p>This is his superpower, the ability to take an advanced eye for space and movement, the famous picture a creative player has in their head, and to use that three-second glimpse forward into the revolving angles, the shifting pieces not to create, but to destroy and staunch and intercept.</p> <p>Still, Kant\u00e9 has been doing other things. As long ago as last year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/14/barcelona-chelsea-champions-league-last-16-second-leg-match-report\" title=\"\">Champions League defeat </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/14/barcelona-chelsea-champions-league-last-16-second-leg-match-report\" title=\"\">by Barcelona</a> at the Camp Nou he produced a brilliantly complete all\u2011round midfield display against Ivan Rakitic, Sergio Busquets and Andr\u00e9s Iniesta.</p> <p>He has played three league games this year but nobody has scored so many goals while also making so many tackles in that time. The pet destroyer is the best all-round midfielder in the Premier League.</p> <p>And why not? The image of Kant\u00e9 has always been circumscribed. The story about him working as a rubbish picker in the Paris suburbs as a child feeds into this notion of some humble, saintly automaton. But Kant\u00e9 is also a qualified accountant. When he refused to take his Chelsea wages through a shell company perhaps it wasn\u2019t because he\u2019s a holy soul looking beyond the material plane, but because he understands financial regulation and accounting practices better than most.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/oct/18/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend\">Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Similarly, the idea of Kant\u00e9 as a servant to the stars seems restrictive.

Plus, there has been some other news this week. Real Madrid and Juventus have let it be known, through the usual channels, that they may just be coming for Kant\u00e9. Not that anyone really believes these stories, product of what the authors of The Club, a brilliantly detailed anatomy of Premier League shenanigans, describe as \u201cthe gossip-industrial complex\u201d. There are obvious holes in the Kant\u00e9 to Madrid yarn. First Chelsea aren\u2019t selling anyone and secondly the article on the DesMarque website states that Kant\u00e9 \u201cdreams of wearing white and leaving Chelsea. He believes they do not aspire to winning important titles with Frank Lampard\u201d. Yeah, right. Does this sound like the N\u2019Golo that you know? What were his exact words? He didn\u2019t like the deal \u2013 but he has to go along with it? It is at least no surprise to hear that Kant\u00e9 should be in demand. He has been lionised in England, adopted as a Premier League force of nature. Albeit there has always been something showy about some of the excitement, a sense of overcompensation. The covering midfielder, the anchor, is not a position English football has historically prized. In Kant\u00e9 we got it, a defensive shield of such energy, with such a flatteringly concussive Premier League style that it became a badge of sophistication to praise him and a possible source of that backlash when a gangly foreign manager who looks as though he\u2019s stepped out to the all-night garage in search of a tin of slim panatellas tried to change him, to bring other layers out of a champion footballer. It is fair to ask why bother. Kant\u00e9 is seriously good at this. He made the most tackles in Europe\u2019s top leagues two seasons in a row. Last season, in a team that had the ball most of the time, he still blocked more passes per game than any other regular Premier League midfielder. This is his superpower, the ability to take an advanced eye for space and movement, the famous picture a creative player has in their head, and to use that three-second glimpse forward into the revolving angles, the shifting pieces not to create, but to destroy and staunch and intercept. Still, Kant\u00e9 has been doing other things. As long ago as last year\u2019s Champions League defeat by Barcelona at the Camp Nou he produced a brilliantly complete all\u2011round midfield display against Ivan Rakitic, Sergio Busquets and Andr\u00e9s Iniesta. He has played three league games this year but nobody has scored so many goals while also making so many tackles in that time. The pet destroyer is the best all-round midfielder in the Premier League. And why not? The image of Kant\u00e9 has always been circumscribed. The story about him working as a rubbish picker in the Paris suburbs as a child feeds into this notion of some humble, saintly automaton. But Kant\u00e9 is also a qualified accountant. When he refused to take his Chelsea wages through a shell company perhaps it wasn\u2019t because he\u2019s a holy soul looking beyond the material plane, but because he understands financial regulation and accounting practices better than most. Similarly, the idea of Kant\u00e9 as a servant to the stars seems restrictive. We hear that he \u201clet Paul Pogba play\u201d at the World Cup, that his yeoman presence liberates others. Maybe what\u2019s happening here is that they\u2019re watching Kant\u00e9 play, a footballer who, in four years, has won four major club trophies and a World Cup medal for three teams, each one transformed by his presence. Probably we should try to enjoy him while we can, starting with Ajax on Tuesday; our own preciously guarded midfield shield, who \u2013 whisper it quietly \u2013 has become a little more than simply that.",

An official boycott \u2013 #grabyourwallet \u2013 of brands financially related to the Trump campaign has affected the popularity of companies before. Remember the recent thing with SoulCycle and Equinox?</p> <p>So do the people who buy Louis Vuitton care that their bag was brought to them by two men who both recently publicly chastised teen climate activist Greta Thunberg on separate occasions?

      "bodyText": "Louis Vuitton, the most valuable luxury brand in the world and prize pony of luxury conglomerate LVMH\u2019s stables, has opened a Texas factory, AKA the Louis Vuitton Rochambeau Ranch. Vuitton promised the venture will provide 1,000 American jobs over the next five years. Yet, at a time where brands are feeling the pressure to be more political and woke than ever, is it not a gigantic faux pas to discount politics on Vuitton\u2019s part? The answer is \u2026 maybe? First off, it\u2019s salient to note that this is not the first Vuitton factory in the States. No, the company has been manufacturing its products in California for three decades (ah, rarified European luxury!). It is, however, the first factory opening to require LVMH\u2019s president, Bernard \u201cThe Wolf in a Cashmere Coat\u201d Arnault, to painfully equivocate about his guest of honor, Donald Trump, who along with daughter Ivanka joined Arnault and LVMH\u2019s top brass for the grand opening. \u201cI am not here to judge his types of policies. I have no political role. I am a business person,\u201d Arnault said of Trump at the ribbon-cutting ceremony, as reported by the New York Times. How convenient, given that while the ceremony was unfolding, US forces were withdrawing from northern Syria, the impeachment procedure has been intensifying, and his 1,000th day in office had just passed with more and more people being concerned by his mental stability. But apart from confirming the fact that Trump cannot pronounce \u201cVuitton\u201d (here\u2019s a handy how-to-pronounce guide), the photo-op raises another question: how are dedicated Vuitton fans going to feel about this? One truth universally recognized by marketers of our era is younger demographics care, more or less, about corporate responsibility. An official boycott \u2013 #grabyourwallet \u2013 of brands financially related to the Trump campaign has affected the popularity of companies before. Remember the recent thing with SoulCycle and Equinox? So do the people who buy Louis Vuitton care that their bag was brought to them by two men who both recently publicly chastised teen climate activist Greta Thunberg on separate occasions? Is Louis Vuitton not worried about the reputational threat of aligning their plastic-y, tan hides with the plastic-y tan hide in chief? Maybe not in Texas where, after all, 77.5% of Johnson county, where the factory is located, voted for Trump in 2016. But according to the Hollywood Reporter, stylists who oversee the wardrobes of the likes of Justin Beiber, Katy Perry and Julia Roberts have already taken to Twitter to cry, essentially, \u201cBig mistake\u201d. Yuge!",

The most breathtaking words came from William McRaven, a former commander of US special operations command who oversaw the 2011 raid that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/02/osama-bin-laden-dead-obama\">killed Osama bin Laden</a>.</p> <p>In an opinion article in the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/opinion/trump-mcraven-syria-military.html\">New York Times</a>, McRaven accused Trump of spreading \u201cfrustration, humiliation, anger and fear\u201d through the armed forces and of championing \u201cdespots and strongmen\u201d while abandoning US allies. The four-star admiral called for Trump to either shape up or ship out of the White House.</p> <p>\u201cIf this president doesn\u2019t demonstrate the leadership that America needs, both domestically and abroad, then it is time for a new person in the Oval Office \u2013 Republican, Democrat or independent \u2013 the sooner, the better. The fate of our Republic depends upon it.\u201d</p> <p>That Trump should be coming under such sharp criticism from figures as revered as McRaven is all the more extraordinary given that Trump put those he called <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/e10865b9478744b2acf3923985992e11\">\u201cmy generals\u201d</a> at the center of his cabinet when he took office almost three years ago. He appointed Jim Mattis as defense secretary, Michael Flynn and HR McMaster as successive national security advisers, and John Kelly as homeland security secretary and then White House chief of staff.</p> <p>Now all those generals are gone, and some are speaking out.</p> <p>Mattis, who has largely kept his silence since resigning last December, made clear his disdain for the president in the form of a stream of jokes at a black-tie roasting on Thursday night. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/18/james-mattis-mocks-donald-trump-overrated-general\">In his first public comments</a> about his former boss, Mattis mocked the amount of time Trump spends on his golf courses and poked fun at how he had avoided military service in Vietnam by claiming bone spurs in his feet.</p> <p>\u201cI earned my spurs on the battlefield; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> earned his spurs in a letter from a doctor,\u201d Mattis said.</p> <p>The new sense of license to criticize Trump among military leaders originated with the president\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/07/us-withdrawal-from-syria-leaves-fate-of-isis-fighters-and-families-in-detention-uncertain\">highly contentious</a> decision last week to pull US troops from northern Syria. The sudden move has paved the way for a Turkish invasion that has put a prominent US ally in the fight against Isis, the Syrian Kurds, in mortal danger.</p> <p>Several US generals and admirals expressed their disgust and bewilderment at Trump\u2019s decision.

      "bodyText": "Four-star US generals and admirals are a taciturn bunch: they measure their words, qualify their statements and guard their silence out of loyalty to the armed forces and to their country. Not this week. A torrent of raw military condemnation has been unleashed on Donald Trump, with some of the most respected figures among retired military leaders lining up to express their profound disapproval of their commander-in-chief. The outpouring was exceptional, both for the sheer number who unloaded on the president and for the unrestrained language in which they put it. The most breathtaking words came from William McRaven, a former commander of US special operations command who oversaw the 2011 raid that killed Osama bin Laden. In an opinion article in the New York Times, McRaven accused Trump of spreading \u201cfrustration, humiliation, anger and fear\u201d through the armed forces and of championing \u201cdespots and strongmen\u201d while abandoning US allies. The four-star admiral called for Trump to either shape up or ship out of the White House. \u201cIf this president doesn\u2019t demonstrate the leadership that America needs, both domestically and abroad, then it is time for a new person in the Oval Office \u2013 Republican, Democrat or independent \u2013 the sooner, the better. The fate of our Republic depends upon it.\u201d That Trump should be coming under such sharp criticism from figures as revered as McRaven is all the more extraordinary given that Trump put those he called \u201cmy generals\u201d at the center of his cabinet when he took office almost three years ago. He appointed Jim Mattis as defense secretary, Michael Flynn and HR McMaster as successive national security advisers, and John Kelly as homeland security secretary and then White House chief of staff. Now all those generals are gone, and some are speaking out. Mattis, who has largely kept his silence since resigning last December, made clear his disdain for the president in the form of a stream of jokes at a black-tie roasting on Thursday night. In his first public comments about his former boss, Mattis mocked the amount of time Trump spends on his golf courses and poked fun at how he had avoided military service in Vietnam by claiming bone spurs in his feet. \u201cI earned my spurs on the battlefield; Donald Trump earned his spurs in a letter from a doctor,\u201d Mattis said. The new sense of license to criticize Trump among military leaders originated with the president\u2019s highly contentious decision last week to pull US troops from northern Syria. The sudden move has paved the way for a Turkish invasion that has put a prominent US ally in the fight against Isis, the Syrian Kurds, in mortal danger. Several US generals and admirals expressed their disgust and bewilderment at Trump\u2019s decision. Adm James Stavridis, former supreme allied commander of Nato, told MSNBC that it was a \u201cgeopolitical mistake of near epic proportion\u201d. He said its long-term impact would be to cast doubt on the reliability of the US as an ally. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine how one could, in a single stroke, re-enable Isis, elevate Iran, allow Vladimir Putin the puppet master to continue his upward trajectory and simultaneously put war criminal chemical-weapon user Bashar al-Assad in the driving seat in Syria.\u201d On the same channel, the former four-star general and battlefield commander in the Gulf, Barry McCaffrey, said the Syrian withdrawal was \u201cinexplicable\u201d. \u201cMr Trump seems to have single-handedly and unilaterally precipitated a national security crisis in the Middle East,\u201d he said, adding that the president had put the armed forces in a \u201cvery tricky situation\u201d. Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, HR McMaster, agreed that the decision would destabilize the region and intensify the Syrian civil war. But the key question is what the highest echelons of the serving military think about Trump\u2019s increasingly erratic leadership. A clue can be found in the viral photograph of the confrontation between Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House, and Trump in the White House on Wednesday. Pelosi is seen jabbing her finger at Trump who appears to be yelling across the table from her. Soon after the photo was taken Pelosi walked out of the meeting after Trump called her a \u201cthird-grade politician\u201d. Sitting next to Trump is Gen Mark Milley, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff \u2013 the highest-ranking officer in the US military. What he was thinking in the moment is not known, but he is looking down at his hands and his face is clenched. Milley may not have the luxury to emote enjoyed by his retired four-star equivalents. But his expression spoke volumes.",

      "bodyText": "An airport car park investment scheme which raised \u00a3230m from thousands of people who poured in their pensions and life savings is at the heart of two legal cases that accuse the directors of making false and misleading statements to attract investors. The Financial Conduct Authority announced on Thursday it had started proceedings against Park First Limited, its senior managers and other connected companies following the collapse of what it said was an \u201cillegal collective investment scheme\u201d. In a separate case, investors are suing the same people, claiming they \u201cfraudulently misrepresented\u201d the nature of the scheme. Park First sold leaseholds for 6,290 airport car parking spaces at Glasgow and Gatwick, and told buyers it would rent them back and pay returns of up to 12%, generated by the holidaymakers who used them. But after sales were stopped by the FCA in 2017, payments slowed or stopped, and the company put some of its businesses into administration. Investors are taking legal action against related companies and the directors, saying that the spaces were overvalued, the demand for them was overstated and that the company is now trespassing on their land. Patrick Lawrence, a lawyer representing investors, said his clients were \u201csuing to recover their pensions, savings and inheritance monies\u201d. And while investors are out of pocket and have set up a crowd-funder to pay for their legal action, the ultimate owner, Toby Whittaker, has taken large dividends from the parent company, Group First Global. The company has denied making fraudulent representations to investors and said that all monies received could be accounted for. Group First Global began to advertise investments in the Park First scheme in 2012. The firm bought land in Glasgow and near Gatwick airport and divided it into individual plots which were marketed on a leasehold basis for \u00a320,000 each, directly and via agents. Brochures for prospective investors heralded \u201ca new commercial property opportunity designed for today\u2019s astute investor that we believe is low risk and highly profitable\u201d. Investors were told that they could lease back their space to Park First for six years, and that it would let it to drivers and pay returns starting at 8% in the first two years, then rising to 10% for two years, then 12% in the final two years of the deal. The brochure referred to a break clause after two years \u201cby agreement\u201d between both parties. Investors typically received the first two years\u2019 payments without problems, but then faced delays, or were told that the contract was being cancelled. The FCA started to look at the scheme in 2015, and in December 2017 told Park First it was in breach of the Financial Services &amp; Markets Act, and that investors had a right to their money back. Park First offered them two choices: they could either sell back the parking space and receive a refund, less the amount they had received in rent, or they could sign up to another leasing scheme which offered a return of just 2% a year. Many investors were unhappy with the options, particularly when it emerged that the company wanted those who were selling back their spot to sign over the deeds and wait up to a year for payment. Then in July this year Group First Global put four companies into administration, blaming the cost of reimbursing investors. All payments were suspended, as administrators moved in to work out what could be returned. The way that the car parks were structured raised questions about how investors would be paid after the original guarantee period. The court filing details how some of the car parks worked on a \u201cmeet and greet\u201d basis, whereby holidaymakers left their cars with a valet who took it to the Park First land and parked it nose to tail with other cars, rather than in designated spots. Others operated on a pay-to-access basis, where the driver paid in advance for a code to get into the car park, then left their car in whichever spot they wanted. Both models meant that Park First was not collecting payments for individual plots, and could not accurately allocate money to individual investors. Investor Hanif Younus told the Guardian he had once tried to visit the four Gatwick parking spaces that he invested in for his sons. \u201cI got there and it\u2019s an open plot \u2013 there are no lines are the floor. I asked the woman running it where my place was, and she said she didn\u2019t know \u2013 that there were no spaces.\u201d Like some other investors, he received the first two years\u2019 payments straight away, along with 5% cashback from the agent who sold him the investment. Since signing the leaseback scheme he has received one small payment. \u201cThe spaces are being let out but we don\u2019t know who is getting the money,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what four places I own, or if I really own anything.\u201d In 2009, one of Whittaker\u2019s previous property businesses, Dylan Harvey was wound up, owing more than \u00a36.5m to investors. More recently, a scheme based on storage units was wound-up by the secretary of state for business over concerns that investors were given misleading information. Store First scheme sold individual rooms in self-storage centres on the same basis as Park First \u2013 investors were told they were getting a 25% gain in value on day one on store pods costing from \u00a33,750 to \u00a322,500, then promised the same level of returns over six years. But after two years most were told that the company wanted to exercise its right to break the contract. In April, after several days of hearings, it was agreed that three Store First companies would be closed and one would continue trading and collect rents to distribute to investors. One investor who spent \u00a322,500 on two units in Barnsley said that he has had very little back. The Store First units have brought in only \u00a3775, less than 1.4% a year, rather than the 10% that was originally promised. And this has been offset by costs - on top of the ground rent charged by Store First, he has received a demand for more than \u00a3300 in business rates from Barnsley borough council. \u201cAt the moment the investments are costing me money,\u201d he said. Group First Global, which is based on a business park in Burnley, was set up in March 2006. In its last set of accounts it declared a turnover of \u00a315m. Whittaker, the sole shareholder in the company, has been paid almost \u00a35m in dividends since 2012. Park First said it was \u201csurprised that the FCA has chosen to commence legal proceedings at this time when the FCA is aware of the material steps that Park First has been taking to restructure its car parking schemes for the benefit of investors. \u201cThe proceedings are unmeritorious and will only disrupt the steps that Park First is presently taking.\u201d In response to the investors\u2019 legal action, Ruth Almond from Group First Global said the Park First investments were all legitimate. She added: \u201cIn order to minimise operating costs and thereby maximise income for the benefit of investors, some of the car parks have been closed. This means that Park First does not incur costs such as business rates in operating these car parks. \u201cThis does not have any impact on investors.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Philip Hammond suspects that Boris Johnson may be attempting to trick MPs into backing a \u201cheavily camouflaged\u201d no-deal Brexit amid claims that senior ministers are wooing hard Brexit supporters with the possibility of crashing out of Europe. The former chancellor, who had the whip withdrawn for opposing no deal, has challenged the prime minister to show that he will not use the transition period to run down the clock and leave without an agreement in December 2020. His claims follow an interview with John Baron, a member of the European Research Group (ERG), who appeared to claim that the cabinet ministers Michael Gove and Dominic Raab had told him that a no-deal exit was possible if trade talks failed. In an article in the Times, Hammond wrote: \u201cI haven\u2019t come this far seeking to avoid no-deal in 2019 to be duped into voting for a heavily camouflaged no-deal at the end of 2020. But I am not a lost cause.\u201d Hammond is backing an amendment tabled by Sir Oliver Letwin that would withhold final support for the deal until the Brexit legislation has been passed. If this amendment passed, it would trigger the Benn act, which requires the government to request a delay until the end of January. Johnson and his allies have spent Friday trying to form a coalition of Tory Brexiters, former Tories and Labour MPs to reach the 320 needed for a Commons majority. Baron, who consistently voted against Theresa May\u2019s deal, indicated he had been told by Johnson\u2019s allies Gove and Raab that the new deal leaves open the possibility of leaving the EU on World Trade Organization rules. \u201cProvided we can get that clear assurance, and I have been given it so far by people like Michael Gove and Dominic Raab, and I\u2019m hoping to get it from the prime minister tomorrow, that we will be leaving after the trade talks, if those trade talks fail up to December 2020, on no-deal terms \u2026 then we\u2019ll be supporting the deal tomorrow,\u201d Baron told the BBC. Second referendum campaigners seized on his words as proof that the prime minister\u2019s deal is a route to a no-deal Brexit. Under the government\u2019s current plan, the UK would leave the EU legally on 31 October but then remain in a transition until December 2020, during which most aspects of EU law would continue to apply. Ministers claim that they will be able to negotiate a new trade relationship with the EU before the end of next year, but the withdrawal agreement allows the transition to be extended for an extra year or two years. Most trade experts think that in practice this will be necessary because there is very little chance of negotiating a trade deal within 14 months. Johnson and his ministers are concentrating on wooing the 28 hardline Brexiters, known as the Spartans, whose votes could be vital in passing the bill on Saturday. Sky News reported on Friday night that Mark Francois, the deputy chair of the ERG, had said he would back the deal following a meeting with Johnson earlier in the day. Some ERG members told the Guardian that they had been persuaded to support the Johnson deal after reading the opinion of a noted barrister and Brexit supporter, Martin Howe QC. He wrote in the Telegraph on Friday that the Johnson deal leaves open an option of walking away from a trade deal. \u201cUnlike the May deal, the UK will have the real option of walking away if the terms are not good enough,\u201d he wrote. Some other hardliners have also held meetings with Johnson.

      "body": "<p>A storm blew into the sleepy little city of Oita on Friday morning. It brought thunder, lightning and tens of thousands of rugby fans from England, Australia, France and Wales. They found each other under the awnings around the central station, where they sang songs about Delilah and Matilda and all the unseemly things that went on in a Chicago department store, while the locals scurried by and sheltered inside. The World Cup has been running for a month already, but really, it is only just getting started. This weekend the eight best teams in the world square off and they all have a shot at winning to reach the semi-finals.</p> <p>The tens of thousands will be joined by tens of millions at kick-off. Half of Japan watched their team play Scotland on TV last Sunday, twice as many as watched their opening match against Russia. So whatever happens when they play South Africa in Tokyo on Sunday evening, the landscape of the game has changed in the past four weeks. The horizon is broader now. There are reams of saccharine quotes we could use, from one of those spurious online collections of inspirational sayings, all about how the point of travel is to learn about yourself as much as it is to visit somewhere else.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/oct/18/rugby-world-cup-2019-quarter-finals-ugo-monye\">Rugby World Cup 2019: where the quarter-finals will be won and lost | Ugo Monye</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Suffice to say rugby is discovering some good things about itself on this particular trip, that it can expand beyond its old heartlands and win over millions of new viewers. The Japanese even have a phrase for it: <em>niwaka</em> fans. Newcomers, bandwagon jumpers. Well hop on. And do not worry, the lyrics come easier than the laws, and are twice as much fun when you have learned them.</p> <p>It helps that Japan are winning. But it is true, too, that there is something there, at the heart of the game, that has drawn this audience to it. The superhuman speed, skill and ferocity, yes, but also its values too. Little things, such as the way the players have made a point of bowing to the crowd, and big ones, such as the footage of the Canadian team going out in the streets to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIXSPqkeIlg\" title=\"\">help shovel up</a> muck when the biggest game of their World Cup, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/11/canada-namibia-world-cup-final-rugby-tier-two-nations\" title=\"\">against Namibia</a>, had been cancelled because of Typhoon Hagibis. That stuff matters in a country where manners do too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6dd3fe41e23bf862d4920ad109ae8a509148c4f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6dd3fe41e23bf862d4920ad109ae8a509148c4f9/0_182_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Japan\u2019s success a boon for the tournament.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Japan\u2019s success a boon for the tournament.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They are values that some of the people running the game maybe need to be reminded of themselves. The only time they seem to pay them any mind is when they are reckoning what they can sell them for. There was a sighting of rugby\u2019s old, narrow-minded parochialism in the petty squabble that blew up last weekend when the men in button-down shirts were busy bickering about which union had stitched up who while matches were being cancelled because the host country was dealing with the worst typhoon since the 1950s.

      "bodyText": "A storm blew into the sleepy little city of Oita on Friday morning. It brought thunder, lightning and tens of thousands of rugby fans from England, Australia, France and Wales. They found each other under the awnings around the central station, where they sang songs about Delilah and Matilda and all the unseemly things that went on in a Chicago department store, while the locals scurried by and sheltered inside. The World Cup has been running for a month already, but really, it is only just getting started. This weekend the eight best teams in the world square off and they all have a shot at winning to reach the semi-finals. The tens of thousands will be joined by tens of millions at kick-off. Half of Japan watched their team play Scotland on TV last Sunday, twice as many as watched their opening match against Russia. So whatever happens when they play South Africa in Tokyo on Sunday evening, the landscape of the game has changed in the past four weeks. The horizon is broader now. There are reams of saccharine quotes we could use, from one of those spurious online collections of inspirational sayings, all about how the point of travel is to learn about yourself as much as it is to visit somewhere else. Suffice to say rugby is discovering some good things about itself on this particular trip, that it can expand beyond its old heartlands and win over millions of new viewers. The Japanese even have a phrase for it: niwaka fans. Newcomers, bandwagon jumpers. Well hop on. And do not worry, the lyrics come easier than the laws, and are twice as much fun when you have learned them. It helps that Japan are winning. But it is true, too, that there is something there, at the heart of the game, that has drawn this audience to it. The superhuman speed, skill and ferocity, yes, but also its values too. Little things, such as the way the players have made a point of bowing to the crowd, and big ones, such as the footage of the Canadian team going out in the streets to help shovel up muck when the biggest game of their World Cup, against Namibia, had been cancelled because of Typhoon Hagibis. That stuff matters in a country where manners do too. They are values that some of the people running the game maybe need to be reminded of themselves. The only time they seem to pay them any mind is when they are reckoning what they can sell them for. There was a sighting of rugby\u2019s old, narrow-minded parochialism in the petty squabble that blew up last weekend when the men in button-down shirts were busy bickering about which union had stitched up who while matches were being cancelled because the host country was dealing with the worst typhoon since the 1950s. If this World Cup has given us a glimpse of what the game could be, it has shown us, too, some of what is holding it back. You can also see that in the way some of the leading countries are all too happy to take from the Pacific Islands without giving anything worthwhile in return. And the way they, and the other emerging nations, struggle to get the fixtures they need against those top teams. And you have to guess that it is right there in the boardrooms where the English clubs and European countries are doing deals with CVC Capital, a vampire squid of a company who were accused of \u201craping the sport\u201d after they got involved with F1. So yes, it is a good moment for rugby to show us its heart and soul. It starts on Saturday, when England play Australia. Eddie Jones compared the World Cup to a game of poker. Well, let\u2019s see what he has got in his hand. He has spent four years getting the team ready for this, winnowing the best of English rugby, nasty, brutish and fast, from the worst, dull, lumpen and unimaginative.

The Wakefield-based retailer, which sells fashion for women over 50 and has 318 shops, said it had got into difficulties after a \u201csustained period of challenging trading conditions and cashflow pressure\u201d. Administrators said they would continue to trade Bonmarch\u00e9 while assessing options for the future for the business. All stores remain open for the time being and no redundancies have been made. Tony Wright, a joint administrator and partner at FRP Advisory who was appointed on Friday afternoon, said: \u201cBonmarch\u00e9 has been a staple on the UK high street for nearly three decades, but the persistent challenges facing retail have taken their toll and led to the administration.\u201d He said he hoped to find a buyer for the business. Helen Connolly, the chief executive of Bonmarch\u00e9, said: \u201cThe high street is going through a period of historic difficulty and we have been unable to weather the economic headwinds impacting the whole of the retail sector.\u201d Bonmarch\u00e9, founded in 1982, is the latest in a string of high street chains to get into difficulties as shoppers rein in spending amid economic uncertainty while staff costs and business rates have risen. Profits have also come under pressure as the value of the pound has fallen against the dollar, increasing the cost of buying goods overseas. Karen Millen, Coast, House of Fraser and Debenhams have all fallen into administration in the past 18 months while New Look and Marks &amp; Spencer have been closing stores. Bonmarch\u00e9, which previously went into administration with sister chain Peacocks in 2012, issued a string of profits warnings in the past year, saying it expected to make a loss of up to \u00a36m this year. The collapse comes after Bonmarch\u00e9 was taken private by the Edinburgh Woollen Mill owner Philip Day\u2019s Dubai-based acquisition vehicle Spectre in August. The value of Day\u2019s \u00a35m-plus investment in Bonmarch\u00e9 will be wiped out in the administration and it is not clear if Day, who also owns Jaeger, Austin Reed and Peacocks, will try and maintain control of the business. Bonmarch\u00e9\u2019s problems emerged on the same day that Watt Brothers, the Scottish department store chain, also called in administrators with 220 immediate redundancies and nearly 90 further jobs on the line.",

A similar incident occurred at the Etna fulfillment center in March 2019, where a picker, Joe Bowman, died after going into cardiac arrest. According to 911 call records, a 60-year-old picker went into cardiac arrest on the job on 20 March 2019 and was found unconscious. \u201cGo back to work,\u201d the supervisor who reported the incident to 911 personnel told another concerned worker while on the phone with theoperator. \u201cEverybody worked as usual,\u201d said a third worker in Etna on the shift.

Amazon also denied providing delayed medical attention to Billy Foister, though it\u2019s not the first time the company has been accused of providing delayed medical attention to a warehouse worker during a cardiac arrest.

It is supposed to be administered only under veterinary supervision and only to sick animals. There are restrictions on its import. Using antibiotics routinely as growth promoter in farm animals is illegal in the UK because it can lead to the development of germs that are resistant to even the strongest antibiotics used in human health. The UK\u2019s outgoing chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies, has said antibiotic resistance is one of the biggest threats to human health. More antibiotics are used on farm animals around the world than on humans. In the UK, the poultry industry has reduced its use of antibiotics in recent years in a voluntary campaign. A source told the Guardian that the poultry farm in question was a large supplier to Moy Park, a chicken slaughtering and processing company that is the largest employer in Northern Ireland. Moy Park, which supplies most leading UK retailers with chicken, confirmed it was supplied by the facility but said it did not own it. \u201cThis matter is being investigated by the relevant authorities,\u201d a Moy Park spokesperson said. \u201cAny breach of the strict regulation on the use of veterinary medicine is unlawful and completely unacceptable to us.\u201d The company said it believed that the investigation involved \u201can isolated incident at an independently owned, contract supply farm\u201d. The incident comes at a particularly sensitive time after Brexit negotiations over health and customs checks for goods moving between Britain, Northern Ireland and Ireland. It is likely to raise fresh concern in Europe about the safety of food supplies after the UK leaves the EU. Investigators will want to establish whether the company has previously imported unregulated medicine, and if so how it was used on the farm and whether poultry containing antibiotic residues has been entering the retail food chain for a long time. The UK are required to notify the European commission about incidents that affect food safety so that a rapid alert can be issued across all EU countries. EU safety authorities said they were not yet aware of the incident.

In 2018 Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld disappeared as a result.</p>\n    <p>In terms of habits, shoppers are switching to buying online. The likes of Amazon have an unfair advantage because they have a lower business rate bill, which holds down costs and enables online retailers to woo shoppers with low prices. Business rates are taxes, based on the value of commercial property, that are imposed on traditional retailers with physical stores.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>At the same time, there is a move away from buying \u2018stuff\u2019 as more people live in smaller homes and rent rather than buy. Those pressures have come just as rising labour and product costs, partly fuelled by Brexit, have coincided with economic and political uncertainty that has dampened consumer confidence.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What help do retailers need?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Retailers with a high-street presence want the government to change business rates. They also want more political certainty as the potential for a no deal Brexit means some are not only incurring additional costs for stockpiling goods but are unsure about the impact of tariffs after October 2019. Retailers also want more investment in town centres to help them adapt to changing trends, as well as a cut to high parking charges which they say put off shoppers.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the government doing?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In the October 2018 budget the government announced&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/26/budget-to-offer-business-rates-relief-for-small-shops\">some relief</a>&nbsp;on business rates for independent shopkeepers. It has also set up a \u00a3675m \u2018future high streets\u2019 fund under which local councils can bid for up to \u00a325m towards regeneration projects such as refurbishing local historic buildings and improving transport links. The fund will also pay for the creation of a high street taskforce to provide expertise and hands-on support to local areas.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the outlook in 2019?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Some retailers could go under. Weakened by a difficult Christmas \u2013 which accounts for the entire annual profits of many retailers, and with further Brexit wobbles to come \u2013 retailers are facing a tough 2019. Another rise in the national minimum wage in April and the falling value of the pound against the dollar, which is used to buy goods in the far east, have also added to costs and hit profits.</p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Sales for the group rose 14% last year to \u00a324m but KPMG said Watt Brothers had continued to make losses in 2018 and 2019 after falling \u00a3680,641 into the red in 2017.</p> \n<p>Blair Nimmo, joint administrator and UK head of restructuring at KPMG, said: \u201cDespite the director\u2019s tireless efforts to increase margins, cut costs and recapitalise the business, Watt Brothers continued to incur trading losses as a result of the well-publicised challenges being experienced across the retail sector.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cUltimately this has led to the unfortunate demise of a well-known and highly regarded business.\u201d</p> \n<p>Nimmo urged anyone interested in the Watt Brothers\u2019 assets to get in touch as soon as possible.</p> \n<p>Watt Brothers\u2019 demise comes after a difficult few years for department stores, which have faced tough competition from the rise of online shopping and increased costs, particularly on business rates.</p> \n<p>Businesses have found it difficult to adapt to rapid changes in shopping habits by moving to more suitable locations or negotiating rent cuts as their large outlets are usually saddled with long leases.</p> \n<p>The latest government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/17/uk-shoppers-shun-big-ticket-items-as-brexit-uncertainty-bites\">data on retail spending</a> revealed a further slump in department store sales last month, which offset a modest rise in clothing and supermarket food purchases.</p> \n<p>John Stevenson, a retail analyst at Peel Hunt, said department stores were losing out to online retailers who now sell the beauty and clothing brands that stores once had exclusive access to.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThere was a time when department stores were the height of excitement, where you would go for the day with health and beauty, a cafe and clothing.

      "bodyText": "The Scottish department store group Watt Brothers has collapsed into administration with the immediate loss of nearly 230 jobs and about 80 more at risk. All 11 of the group\u2019s stores were closed on Friday, but the flagship outlet on Glasgow\u2019s Sauchiehall Street will open on 19 October for a clearance sale as administrators from KPMG seek a potential buyer. Administrators said 229 of the group\u2019s 306 employees had been made redundant with immediate effect. The fourth-generation family-owned chain was founded when farmer\u2019s son Allan Watt set up a drapery shop in Glasgow in the late 1800s. It moved into its current flagship store in 1915 and had six stores by the 1960s before a more recent expansion spurt from 2004. Sales for the group rose 14% last year to \u00a324m but KPMG said Watt Brothers had continued to make losses in 2018 and 2019 after falling \u00a3680,641 into the red in 2017. Blair Nimmo, joint administrator and UK head of restructuring at KPMG, said: \u201cDespite the director\u2019s tireless efforts to increase margins, cut costs and recapitalise the business, Watt Brothers continued to incur trading losses as a result of the well-publicised challenges being experienced across the retail sector.\u201d \u201cUltimately this has led to the unfortunate demise of a well-known and highly regarded business.\u201d Nimmo urged anyone interested in the Watt Brothers\u2019 assets to get in touch as soon as possible. Watt Brothers\u2019 demise comes after a difficult few years for department stores, which have faced tough competition from the rise of online shopping and increased costs, particularly on business rates. Businesses have found it difficult to adapt to rapid changes in shopping habits by moving to more suitable locations or negotiating rent cuts as their large outlets are usually saddled with long leases. The latest government data on retail spending revealed a further slump in department store sales last month, which offset a modest rise in clothing and supermarket food purchases. John Stevenson, a retail analyst at Peel Hunt, said department stores were losing out to online retailers who now sell the beauty and clothing brands that stores once had exclusive access to. \u201cThere was a time when department stores were the height of excitement, where you would go for the day with health and beauty, a cafe and clothing. They were a footfall magnet. But when they started to lose that exclusivity and the way we shop changed they don\u2019t stand up so well.\u201d As times have changed, chains such as House of Fraser and Debenhams have been struggling for survival amid waves of discounting that have hit profits at more stable groups, including John Lewis. Watt Brothers store closures are the latest amid a flood of consolidation across the sector. House of Fraser went into administration in August last year and has closed seven of its 59 sites since it was rescued by Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct group. A further store in Exeter is set to close next month and several more are expected to close after Christmas, as the most recent figures showed the chain losing more than \u00a31m a week. Debenhams is poised to close more than 20 stores in January as part of a rescue restructure agreed after it went into administration in April.",

The business, energy and industrial select committee will question former chief executives Manny Fontenla-Novoa and Harriet Green on Wednesday, building on evidence given last week by directors who were in charge when the travel agent collapsed. In written evidence to the inquiry, the IoD \u2013 one of the UK\u2019s most influential business lobby groups \u2013 said it did not believe flaws in the wider corporate governance regime were to blame. Instead it advised MPs to focus on the tenure of Fontenla-Novoa, who took over after the ill-fated \u00a32.7bn merger with MyTravel and oversaw a period of aggressive debt-fuelled expansion. \u201cThis may have led to a situation whereby the company was subsequently unable to withstand significant downward shocks to its market environment,\u201d the IoD said, citing setbacks such as terror attacks in tourist destinations and a heatwave that kept holidaymakers across Europe at home. \u201cWe would be interested to understand the decision-making and oversight process surrounding the acquisition and management of these debt levels,\u201d the IoD said. Thomas Cook\u2019s auditors and Fontenla-Novoa\u2019s successor, Harriet Green, are also due to give evidence to MPs. The two bosses were paid \u00a327m between them and are likely to face criticism over their pay deals. The IoD also said it was concerned at reports that some debt investors tried to block a rescue for Thomas Cook because they hoped to make money from credit default swaps, a form of insurance against a company going bust. It also echoed MPs\u2019 concerns that directors\u2019 pay and bonuses were calculated on profit numbers that excluded one-off negative items. In a separate submission to the inquiry, British pilots\u2019 trade union Balpa called for a closer examination of how Thomas Cook\u2019s overseas subsidiaries, including the German airline Condor, avoided being placed into liquidation.",

There is a real irony that a group of Labour MPs could now vote against their party\u2019s policy to take us out of the EU when some of their predecessors voted against their party\u2019s policy to take us in. Andrew Harris Moulsford, Oxfordshire \u2022 Owen Jones is right. The problem is that Jeremy Corbyn wants Brexit so he is trying to make it easy for leaver MPs to support the Johnson deal. He wants Brexit but not to be blamed for it, hence this ploy. John Cookson Bournemouth \u2022 Simon Jenkins (A deal is done. Now let\u2019s end the agony, 18 October) may well be right to proclaim \u201cit is time, surely, to end this agony\u201d, but what has he to say about the agony that Brexit is likely to inflict on the economy, the NHS, the standard of living for a substantial proportion of the population and the future of the union? Jeremy Beecham Labour House of Lords \u2022 So this is it. This is Brexit at last. Now we have some substance. Rather than the debate revolving endlessly around the referendum vote and the \u201cwill of the people\u201d, we can now ask the substantive question: is the deal on offer better for us as a people than the deal we already have? This is the point we should have reached prior to invoking article 50. Time to rectify matters. Time for the actual debate to begin. Roy Boffy Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands \u2022 If it\u2019s such a good deal for Northern Ireland why can\u2019t we have it for the rest of the UK?

A change can only happen if it is voted on by the Stormont assembly.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Consent</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Stormont will have a key role in future Brexit arrangements. And if there is cross-community support to remain aligned to the EU rather than the UK the consent will hold for eight years.</p>\n    <p>The arrangements in this deal will automatically kick in for a mandated four years if there is a breakdown in trade talks, so it remains a \u201cbackstop\u201d but with a permanent tinge.</p>\n    <p>That four-year period will start at the end of December 2020.</p>\n    <p>Two months before the end of the four-year period, that is October 2024, Stormont will be asked to vote on whether to remain aligned to the EU in ways outlined by this deal or not.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Checks on border, ports and airports</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Under the deal, the UK and the EU are \u201cunderlining their firm commitment to no customs and regulatory checks or controls and related physical infrastructure at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland\u201d.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Future trade deals</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The EU and the UK will aim for a zero-tariff deal with unlimited quotas. The entire UK, including Northern Ireland, will be free to sign trade deals. The line in the political declaration that \u201cthe United Kingdom will consider aligning with union rules in relevant areas\u201d in any future trade talks has been ditched.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Customs</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Northern Ireland will remain legally in the UK customs territory but practically in the EU customs unions. There will therefore be no customs checks on the border but tariffs will be payable on certain commercial goods.</p>\n    <p>No customs duties will be payable on \u201cpersonal property\u201d being transited from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. That protects online shopping and all items bought for personal rather than commercial use.</p>\n    <p>Customs duties will be payable on goods imported from the UK for commercial use unless it can be demonstrated that the goods remain in Northern Ireland or are for personal use, as above.</p>\n    <p>A system of rebates will allow importers to be reimbursed.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>West/east trade</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The commitment to frictionless trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain is restated.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>VAT</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>EU law on VAT will apply in Northern Ireland.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Single electricity market</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The island of Ireland is considering a single market for electricity so homes in Northern Ireland can get their energy from a supplier in Northern Ireland or the republic.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s manufacturers have responded to the prime minister\u2019s Brexit deal with deep misgivings in the run-up to the vote in parliament on Saturday. The lobby group for the engineering and manufacturing industries, Make UK, said though it was relieved at the possibility of leaving the EU with a deal, the new agreement failed in several important ways to overcome the concerns of its members, not least the transition deal, which stretches to just 14 months, and the lack of commitments to maintaining the closest possible trading relationship with the EU. The warning follows a letter this week from industry chiefs to the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, warning him the deal posed a \u201cserious risk to manufacturing competitiveness\u201d. Clearly distressed by the government\u2019s push for a harder Brexit than was agreed by Theresa May, chief executives from the aerospace, automotive, food and drink, chemicals, and pharmaceutical sectors, said their main concern was being excluded from EU regulatory institutions \u2013 a move that would diminish their influence and increase their costs. Make UK went further, accusing the government of four strategic errors that should be rectified if it wanted industry to thrive, including an extension to the transition period, a commitment to regulatory alignment and a loosening of planned migration controls. Manufacturers fear Boris Johnson\u2019s deal will hit their profits directly and indirectly as the economy weakens over time, a trend outlined by the Department for Exiting the EU (DExEU) in its assessment last year of rival Brexit scenarios. DExEU, which at the time was promoting May\u2019s deal, used information from the Treasury, the Bank of England and the City regulator \u2013 the Financial Conduct Authority \u2013 to show that a deal akin to Johnson\u2019s would cost the economy 6.7% of GDP over the next 15 years, equivalent to about \u00a3130bn in lost income or \u00a32,250 for each person. May\u2019s deal was considered to have a much milder negative effect on the economy, with the report saying the cost would be nearer to 2.5% of GDP by 2034. MPs on the Treasury select committee said in July the report, published last November, needed to be updated before MPs voted again on a fresh Brexit deal. On Friday they repeated that demand, saying only the Bank of England had answered their call. Catherine McKinnell, the cross-party committee\u2019s interim chair, said she had written to the chancellor, Sajid Javid, asking HM Treasury to publish its updated economic analysis before Saturday\u2019s vote. \u201cIf the chancellor does not provide the committee with an update, we can only assume that the existing analysis stands,\u201d she said. Javid arrived in London on Friday after attending the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in Washington where his plans to bolster spending and borrowing after Brexit received a cool reception from IMF officials. The organisation\u2019s economists are concerned that the UK\u2019s public finances remain fragile after a slow recovery since the 2008 financial crash, and restrictions on exports to its main trading partner will weaken it further. An analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies this month showed the uncertainty had knocked GDP by 2% to 3%. Yet, the government\u2019s commitments to increase spending on road, rail, hospitals and schools form a key plank of its post-Brexit recovery plans. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, accused Javid of not going far enough with the \u00a314bn Whitehall spending boost he announced last month, saying it did little to overcome 10 years of austerity and a three-year period when companies failed to buy new equipment and cut training, leaving the UK trailing other powerful trading countries on important measures of investment. Javid is expected to respond to his critics with even higher spending in his upcoming budget, scheduled for 6 November. In the meantime Johnson has appealed to business leaders in a letter that claims the deal provides \u201cthe certainty businesses need so that the country can come together and move on\u201d.

The recall applies to lot #22318RB. The company said it could not confirm whether the sample was cross-contaminated, whether the product\u2019s seal was intact, or whether the sample was taken from an authentic bottle of Johnson &amp; Johnson talcum powder. The company said it has conducted \u201cthousands of tests over the past 40 years repeatedly to confirm that our consumer talc products do not contain asbestos\u201d. Although pediatricians have advised against using talcum powder on infants for decades, arguing there is a risk of inhalation and infection to babies, talcum powder has remained Johnson &amp; Johnson\u2019s best-known household staple. The product is made from pure talc, a mineral which often appears in veins alongside asbestos in the earth. \u201cOur talc comes from ore sources confirmed to meet our stringent specifications that exceed industry standards,\u201d the company said. \u201cNot only do we and our suppliers routinely test to ensure our talc does not contain asbestos, our talc has also been tested and confirmed to be asbestos-free by a range of independent laboratories, universities and global health authorities.\u201d Concerns have also been raised about the health impacts of talc itself. For decades, talc was routinely used as a dry lubricant in condoms and latex gloves, until physicians raised health concerns about talc, particularly for women. In a series of investigations by the New York Times and Reuters, internal documents from Johnson &amp; Johnson revealed some company executives worried about the talcum products, including possible asbestos contamination, further government regulation and public backlash over health concerns.",

      "bodyText": "Mexico\u2019s president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, has insisted that his government was right to release one of the sons of imprisoned drug lord Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n, a day after his brief capture by the army sparked a wave of attacks by cartel gunmen who took soldiers hostage and paralyzed the northern city of Culiac\u00e1n. \u201cThis decision was taken to protect citizens. You cannot fight fire with fire,\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador said in his daily press conference on Friday morning. \u201cWe do not want deaths. We do not want war.\u201d But the aborted arrest \u2013 and the chaos that it unleashed \u2013 prompted accusations that the government had simply folded in the face of cartel firepower, and cast further doubt on the president\u2019s efforts to overhaul Mexico\u2019s security strategy. \u201cThere is nothing admirable about this decision,\u201d the security expert Alejandro Hope tweeted on Friday morning. \u201cBy launching a badly planned operation that was then badly executed, the government laid itself open to being blackmailed.\u201d Carlos Bravo Regidor, a professor at the Centre for Research and Teaching in Economics, tweeted: \u201cFirst it was an operational disaster. Then it was communications disaster. And finally it was a political disaster.\u201d According to the official version, Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez was detained in a house in Culiac\u00e1n between about 3pm and 5.30pm on Thursday, triggering a huge and extremely violent response from the cartel which led the authorities to withdraw from the house \u2013 leaving him behind. \u201cThe capture of a criminal cannot be worth more than the lives of people,\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador said. At a rowdy press conference held by the country\u2019s top security officials in Culiac\u00e1n on Friday, the public security secretary Alfonso Durazo said that eight troops and one army officer were \u201cheld and later liberated\u201d by the criminals, adding weight to reports that the captured soldiers were freed in exchange for Guzm\u00e1n. Durazo blamed the debacle on a group of police and soldiers who had jumped the gun with the attempt to arrest Ovidio. \u201cThis is not about a state failing. What there was was a failed operation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a rushed operation in which the reaction of the criminals was not taken into consideration.\u201d The scale of that reaction stunned Mexicans, as footage shared on social media showed heavily armed cartel gunmen in the streets with panicked residents fleing to a soundtrack of gunfire. At least eight people were killed and 21 wounded in the clashes. Hundreds of cartel gunmen were deployed around the city of one million people, blocking streets with burning vehicles or riding about on pickup trucks with mounted .50 calibre machine guns. Durazo said that there were 14 separate attacks on the military and 19 roadblocks were thrown up across the city. Videos also showed dozens of escaped prisoners flooding into the streets and commandeering passing vehicles at gunpoint. On Friday morning the local authorities confirmed that 49 prisoners were still at large. Adding to the confusion, authorities were slow to communicate with the panicked population, offering no explanation or comment beyond calling on people to stay indoors. The government, however, is struggling to convince observers that it does not bear responsibility for creating the problem in the first place. Officials said it was triggered by the \u201cprecipitated\u201d action by members of a patrol that launched into an operation to arrest Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n, on a warrant with a view to extradition, without first having secured a judicial order allowing them entrance to the house. The officials also insisted that the 29-year-old son of Mexico\u2019s most infamous drug baron, who is also wanted in the US on drug trafficking charges, was never actually arrested because the formal procedures were not completed. During his press conference L\u00f3pez Obrador, known as Amlo, insisted that time would convince the Mexican public that his government was right in aiming to put avoiding conflict with the cartels. \u201cI ask the people of Mexico not to worry,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be no impunity because there is no collusion between the criminals and the authorities. The line is very clear.\u201d At least one video relating to Thursday\u2019s events seemed to contradict this: the clip shows cartel gunmen exchanging handshakes and fist-bumps with soldiers on the streets of Culiac\u00e1n. It remained unclear how long Ovidio was held and whether there had been negotiations to secure his freedom. Amlo also dismissed a question about whether the government\u2019s willingness to let Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n go had boosted the cartel\u2019s power. \u201cHow can this possibly strengthen an organization that uses violence?\u201d he asked. \u201cThey don\u2019t have reason on their side. If you use force you don\u2019t have moral authority.\u201d The president argues his predecessors\u2019 military-led offensives against the cartels have only exacerbated Mexico\u2019s violence, but his focus on long-term crime prevention has failed to rein in the bloodshed, and the country of 125 million people now sees an average of 100 homicides every day. Earlier this week, 13 police officers were killed in ambush by gunmen from the Jalisco New Generation cartel, one of the many groups contesting territory with the Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s Sinaloa federation. Thursday\u2019s events buried any assumption that the Sinaloa cartel had been weakened since El Chapo\u2019s extradition; the brazen show of force far outscaled the group\u2019s response on any of the three occasions when the kingpin himself was captured. Until Thursday Ovidio had not been among the most well-known of El Chapo\u2019s many children. The highest profile of them is usually said to be Ivan Archivaldo, who was also rumoured to have been captured or killed during Thursday\u2019s events. Alhough calm has returned to the streets of Culiac\u00e1n, tension and terror continued to reverberate on Friday. Schools were closed for the day, as were many public offices. A lawyer for the Guzm\u00e1ns said on Friday the family was grateful the security forces had treated Ovidio well. Jos\u00e9 Luis Gonz\u00e1lez Meza told Radio F\u00f3rmula that the family had been deeply worried when Ovidio had \u201cdisappeared\u201d. \u201cThank God it turned out he is alive, and his brother Ivan Archivaldo too,\u201d the lawyer said.",

      "bodyText": "I love London because it\u2019s an exciting place to live and it has lots of landmarks. London can get very busy because lots of people want to come here. You might not know this but it\u2019s great being a little kid in a big city because there\u2019s lots to do and it\u2019s easy to get about. It\u2019s fastest to go on the train because then you don\u2019t get stuck in traffic. I like to do crossword puzzles waiting at the station and to wave at the driver. All aboard? Off we go \u2026 Blackfriars station London in a nutshell Start right in the middle of London \u2013 literally, because Blackfriars station is on the river. It\u2019s right next to a big art museum called Tate Modern. There are cool exhibitions with light-up kaleidoscopes and swings. Outside, look for the performers by the river who blow massive bubbles so big you can jump inside. Watch out for the statues. They are not real statues, but people dressed up in gold. Blackfriars station Walk past Shakespeare\u2019s Globe theatre and on to Borough Market where you can eat any sort of food you fancy. Maybe sausages or a big lunch like paella and the most ginormous fudgy chocolate brownie. Look out for the new Thames virtual reality experience by One London Bridge. It\u2019s like a big pair of goggles that lets you see all the wildlife in the Thames, like seahorses, seals and even dolphins and sharks. You have to go to Tower Bridge because at the top there\u2019s a glass walkway. It looks like you\u2019re standing on air. Me and my mum and little sister lay down on the glass and it was super duper scary but really exciting. It feels like you\u2019re flying above the buses and boats below. The road rises up to let tall ships in and out of London. From the top you can see an old warship called HMS Belfast, the jungle at the Sky Garden, lots of skyscrapers like the Shard, and the Tower of London. The Tower of London is a real palace where the Crown Jewels live. They look delicious, but they\u2019re rocks not sweets and you\u2019re not allowed to lick them. The crown has a sparkly disco ball on top, which is cool. You can go on a tour and meet the ravens and look at the king\u2019s armour. It\u2019s silly there isn\u2019t any armour for queens. Why isn\u2019t there any? If I was the Queen I\u2019d want my own armour. Greenwich station Pirates, tall ships and turtles The train takes you right past the Shard and St Paul\u2019s Cathedral to Greenwich. Climb aboard the big ship from long, long ago called the Cutty Sark. You can run up and down on the deck but you\u2019re not allowed to jump off the railings. You\u2019re not allowed to jump on the little bunk beds either, but it\u2019s fun to play in the captain\u2019s cabin. The ship isn\u2019t in the water. It\u2019s in a big hall with a cafe where you can get a kids\u2019 lunchbox or a fancy afternoon tea with lots of little cakes. Don\u2019t bother with the meridian line. It\u2019s not time travel like I thought it would be. It\u2019s just a line with lots of people queuing up to take boring photos. But you might like the space exhibition at the planetarium in the Royal Observatory. You can fly to the sun or land on Mars and see what a star looks like when it is born. The National Maritime Museum is my favourite because it\u2019s got a big kids\u2019 zone. You can climb the rigging, fix old boats, dress up like a pirate, catch pretend lobsters and sell them in the crab shop. Upstairs by the cafe there\u2019s a giant map you can run all over. You can stand on your country and run across the ocean. Russia is very big. England is teeny weeny. In the grownup part of the museum there is Lord Nelson\u2019s jacket with a bullet hole in the shoulder, paintings by Turner, who I\u2019m learning about in school, and figureheads from old boats, which I used to be scared of. My mum got me a little baby turtle (not a real one) in the gift shop. She\u2019s called Turtle. Wimbledon station Den-making, multisports and peanut butter ice-cream On Sunday morning come to Junior Parkrun in Wimbledon Park. It\u2019s free but you have to register. I run 2km with my friends Josie, Alex and Emily. Sometimes I walk. After Parkrun you can get peanut butter ice-cream or strawberry sorbet in the park cafe.

Wimbledon Park has everything: a big lake where kids can sail their own boats, an obstacle course, two playgrounds (for babies and older children), mini golf and beach volleyball.

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s a real sense of occasion now we\u2019ve almost reached the bit of Brexit where the elites who gifted it to us don\u2019t have to pretend any more. Always ahead of the curve, David Cameron is leaning in to the coming winds of financial and ritualistic deregulation with demob abandon. Speaking in Harrogate to promote his book on Thursday night, Cameron predicted success for Boris Johnson and his deal. As the former prime minister put it: \u201cThe thing about the greased piglet is that he manages to slip through other people\u2019s hands where mere mortals fail.\u201d That\u2019s it, mate. Why keep your mouth shut about pigs any more? We should just take it from one who knows: greasing a pig makes it go better. Given the dramatic degeneration of our public conversation over the past three years, it feels right that Cameron chose to finally \u201cgo there\u201d on the porcine front in Harrogate, a town that was for so long a byword for a certain type of regional gentility. I would imagine his next tour stop will be in Royal Leamington Spa, where he will expand on the point with a demonstration comparing different means of lubricant. Local boars who\u2019ve always wanted to put their daughter on the stage are invited to get in touch with his promoter. As for which atrocious timeline we are about to be flung into tomorrow, who can say? A lot of journalists would certainly like to say. Everything has improved, hasn\u2019t it, since journalists decided their job is predicting what might happen in the future as opposed to reporting on what they do currently know, or scrutinising what they can currently see. Thus the 36 hours or so between Johnson announcing his deal in Brussels and the special sitting of parliament to vote on it feel like they have been mostly spent watching or reading hacks and pundits debating the complex question, \u201cWill the agreement pass?\u201d I don\u2019t know, guys! I guess you could concentrate on what\u2019s in it \u2013 or are you as committed to a no-spoilers Brexit as the government is? Lavishing hours of airtime and miles of column inches on speculating precisely how close it all is feels a bit like being given advance notice of a shitstorm, and frittering your day away taking spread bets on the possible wind speed. Six votes? Three votes? Would someone like to come on air and say they reckon there\u2019s maybe just a couple of votes in it? What if it was a tie? Either way, the conclusion, which may of course be debunked tomorrow, is that it will be Very Close. Then, when it is, lots of people will be able to sweep online to declare that they \u201cCALLED IT\u201d. You can print out those tweets and burn them for warmth in the years when we\u2019re discovering the true implications of the Very Close Vote on whatever it was a vote on. The only people who seem to have spent less time thinking about the detail are the likes of Andrew Bridgen. \u201cIt looks like Brexit, it smells like Brexit,\u201d he explained to Channel 4 News. \u201cThat\u2019s Brexit for me.\u201d Despite being even more cruelly miscast as a \u201cSpartan\u201d than cinema\u2019s Gerard Butler once was, the likes of Mark Francois and Andrew Bridgen have succeeded in getting apparently serious commentators to use their self-styled nickname \u201cthe Spartans\u201d without deploying airquotes so thrustingly sarcastic that they could be harnessed for wind power. Meanwhile, Michael Gove could be found lurching unsteadily towards the TV camera to bat away Andrew Neil\u2019s inquiry about the possibility of a second referendum amendment. \u201cThat ain\u2019t gonna happen,\u201d drawled the bespectacled Clint Eastwood of Surrey Heath. \u201cAin\u2019t gonna \u2013 ain\u2019t gonna be no second referendum.\u201d In retrospect, that may be the moment this once self-respecting nation had to officially admit it was over.

      "body": "<h2><strong>1 Tight games</strong></h2> <p>Unsightly thrashings by the vastly superior of the hopelessly under-resourced remain a thing at World Cups. The days of the three-digit hiding seem past but a cynic will tell you the World Cup begins only now. Some of these knockout matches will be tight, breathlessly so. If too tight, there will be extra time of 10 minutes each way, then, if necessary, sudden death for another 10 minutes. If still unresolved, there will be a place-kicking competition between five kickers from each team. See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/may/04/cardiff-leicester-heineken-cup\" title=\"\">the Heineken Cup semi-final of 2009</a> for the only precedent. It was brutal.</p> <h2><strong>2 Controversial cards</strong></h2> <p>Just how tight these games are will be swayed in some cases by the referees\u2019 waving of cards at players trying to make honest tackles. Since World Rugby\u2019s directives came in, we have decried and celebrated these cards in more or less equal voice, the rugby world split over their efficacy and appropriateness. But now we could see a World Cup decided by one or more of them. One half of the debate will scream the tackler will \u201cjust have to get lower\u201d; the other will counter that tacklers are lower but still the red cards keep coming. Maybe they are unavoidable?</p> <h2><strong>3 Attack is the new defence</strong></h2> <p>For all its maddening controversies, this is a golden age for rugby. We have never had it so good.

      "bodyText": "1 Tight games Unsightly thrashings by the vastly superior of the hopelessly under-resourced remain a thing at World Cups. The days of the three-digit hiding seem past but a cynic will tell you the World Cup begins only now. Some of these knockout matches will be tight, breathlessly so. If too tight, there will be extra time of 10 minutes each way, then, if necessary, sudden death for another 10 minutes. If still unresolved, there will be a place-kicking competition between five kickers from each team. See the Heineken Cup semi-final of 2009 for the only precedent. It was brutal. 2 Controversial cards Just how tight these games are will be swayed in some cases by the referees\u2019 waving of cards at players trying to make honest tackles. Since World Rugby\u2019s directives came in, we have decried and celebrated these cards in more or less equal voice, the rugby world split over their efficacy and appropriateness. But now we could see a World Cup decided by one or more of them. One half of the debate will scream the tackler will \u201cjust have to get lower\u201d; the other will counter that tacklers are lower but still the red cards keep coming. Maybe they are unavoidable? 3 Attack is the new defence For all its maddening controversies, this is a golden age for rugby. We have never had it so good. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you rugby was better in the \u201colden days\u201d, when set pieces were as numerous as tackles, players were wilfully and spinelessly vicious yet barely ever penalised, let alone sent off, and play never made it beyond a couple of phases. Now, even the old adage that defence wins prizes is under threat, with all eight quarter-finalists (well, maybe not Wales) favouring attack over defence. The teams are split five and three between northern and southern hemispheres but the coaches one-seven. Could that have anything to do with it? 4 Everyone\u2019s a Pacific Islander The darlings of the rugby world, Fiji, Tonga and Samoa, have departed the stage. Or at least the teams bearing their flags have. The peoples themselves are well represented, with all four quarter-finals featuring players of island descent. But for injury and suspension (brandishing red cards is one thing but do players really have to be banned from the rest of a World Cup too?) there would be even more. Marvel at their speed, their power and deftness of touch. Remember where they come from, consider the economic realities that have scattered them around the globe and just be grateful for exhilarating rugby. 5 Watch the watchers Of all the stats we have been bombarded with at this World Cup, here is the most pertinent: 60 million plus.

In 2015, 25 million watched their penultimate pool match against Samoa, which in turn had smashed rugby\u2019s previous record for a TV audience in a single country \u2014 the 21 million in France who watched the 2007 host country lose their semi-final to England.

Stencilled patterns give way to modelled and shaded limbs that then suddenly lose their three-dimensionality and become flat outlines, or turn into cartoonish drawing. Heads fade into washy silhouette under wodges of thickly painted and combed hair. Bodies go all harlequin-patterned, the scrabbling and clutching hands turn from the sensual to the mechanical.</p> <p>There is a lot going on. Sometimes we are taken back to Hockney\u2019s work from the 60s, and his own experiment with degrees and styles of representation. Quarles quotes his California swimming-pool paintings with her own white ripples on blue water. One can link to gear shifts in Hockney\u2019s Rocky Mountains and Tired Indians, or in his Man in a Museum (You\u2019re in the Wrong Movie) to the disjunctures in Quarles\u2019 paintings. But as much as Hockney is in Quarles\u2019 art, so you can also find hints of the body distortions in the self-portraits of Austrian painter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/apr/24/art.austria\">Maria Lassnig</a>, and in the paintings of US-based British painter <a href=\"https://www.sadiecoles.com/artists/45-nicola-tyson/\">Nicola Tyson</a> in Quarles\u2019 work.</p> <p>Born to a white mother and black father, Quarles is pale-skinned, and often taken as white. The figures in her paintings refuse the normative. Her bodies exist in complex, interdependent ways with the spaces they inhabit. She has a complicated relationship to her artistic peers and forebears. As with Davie, and so with Hockney, we are all somehow under the influence, learning to escape.</p> <ul> <li><p>Both exhibitions are at the Hepworth Gallery, Wakefield, until 19 January.</p></li> </ul>",

Heads fade into washy silhouette under wodges of thickly painted and combed hair. Bodies go all harlequin-patterned, the scrabbling and clutching hands turn from the sensual to the mechanical. There is a lot going on. Sometimes we are taken back to Hockney\u2019s work from the 60s, and his own experiment with degrees and styles of representation. Quarles quotes his California swimming-pool paintings with her own white ripples on blue water. One can link to gear shifts in Hockney\u2019s Rocky Mountains and Tired Indians, or in his Man in a Museum (You\u2019re in the Wrong Movie) to the disjunctures in Quarles\u2019 paintings. But as much as Hockney is in Quarles\u2019 art, so you can also find hints of the body distortions in the self-portraits of Austrian painter Maria Lassnig, and in the paintings of US-based British painter Nicola Tyson in Quarles\u2019 work. Born to a white mother and black father, Quarles is pale-skinned, and often taken as white. The figures in her paintings refuse the normative. Her bodies exist in complex, interdependent ways with the spaces they inhabit. She has a complicated relationship to her artistic peers and forebears. As with Davie, and so with Hockney, we are all somehow under the influence, learning to escape. Both exhibitions are at the Hepworth Gallery, Wakefield, until 19 January.",

Or Filthy Lucre Corner, to give its full name. </strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A multimillion-pound sponsorship dispute between Liverpool FC and sportswear giant New Balance has reached the High Court.</p> <p>The club is being sued over its alleged refusal to honour the terms of its reported \u00a340 million-a-year deal with the company, which expires in May 2020.</p> <p>Under the terms of the deal, New Balance is entitled to renew its sponsorship if it matches the terms of any competitor\u2019s offer to sponsor Liverpool kit.</p> <p>But the current European champions, who have been offered a \u00a330 million-a-year five-year deal by American sportswear giant Nike, argue that New Balance cannot match Nike\u2019s offer in relation to the marketing and distribution of Liverpool products.</p> <p>Opening New Balance\u2019s case on Friday, Daniel Oudkerk QC said his client was \u201cone of the world\u2019s leading sports footwear and apparel manufacturers with annual revenues exceeding three billion US dollars\u201d.</p> <p>He added that Liverpool, who are currently top of the Premier League, \u201chas enjoyed very significant success on the pitch\u201d in recent seasons, which he said had been reflected in record sales.</p> <p>\u201cIt is anticipated that the club\u2019s home kit will once again be the club\u2019s highest selling kit at 2.9 million units (sold),\u201d he told the court.</p> <p>Mr Oudkerk told Mr Justice Teare that the key issue in the case was whether New Balance had matched \u201cthe material, measurable and matchable terms of a third-party offer\u201d.</p> <p>Liverpool argues that New Balance has not matched Nike\u2019s offer, which includes a commitment to sell licensed products in \u201cnot less than 6,000 stores worldwide, 500 of which shall be Nike owned\u201d.</p> <p>But Mr Oudkerk said New Balance has \u201capproximately 40,000-odd retail doors globally\u201d.</p> <p>Mr Oudkerk submitted that, after the club received Nike\u2019s offer in June, it initially refused to disclose the terms of the offer in order to get New Balance to \u201ceffectively bid blind\u201d - and then proposed terms \u201cbased upon a \u00a360 million annual payment\u201d.</p> <p>In his written case, Mr Oudkerk argued that Liverpool dismissed New Balance\u2019s offer to match terms as the club was \u201cwedded to Nike\u201d, and that \u201cit appears that the club had resolved to reject the New Balance match come what may\u201d.</p> <p>He added that Liverpool \u201cappears to have considered the renewal option inconvenient\u201d, pointing to a WhatsApp message between two of the club\u2019s directors in which one said the clause \u201cjust absolutely screws us\u201d.</p> <p>Guy Morpuss QC, representing the club, argued that the claim was \u201creally an attempt by New Balance to use a matching clause for a purpose for which it was never intended\u201d.</p> <p>He said New Balance\u2019s contention it could distribute Liverpool kit to 40,000 stores was \u201ca myth\u201d, adding that the company had \u201cgrossly overstated\u201d the number of stores it could distribute to.</p> <p>Opening Liverpool\u2019s case, he said: \u201cWe make no secret of the fact that we were trying to use Nike\u2019s (offer) ... as a stick to beat New Balance with to try and get a higher fee out of them.\u201d</p> <p>Mr Morpuss added that that was an \u201centirely legitimate commercial tactic\u201d.</p> <p>He said that \u201cwhat New Balance needed to do if it was not going to offer us the additional money, up its annual fee, was it needed to actually come forward and genuinely match the terms that Nike offered\u201d.</p> <p>He said the \u201cmain point\u201d in issue was \u201ccould they (New Balance) match the distribution that Nike was offering: 6,000 stores, 500 of which were owned and operated by New Balance?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe idea that New Balance would even get football kit into anything close to those 40,000 stores is utterly fanciful,\u201d Mr Morpuss said.</p> <p>He explained that, under the terms of its offer, \u201cNike was paying us a lower fee than New Balance (but) Nike is guaranteeing distribution and it is paying us a royalty\u201d of 20% of net sales of Liverpool products.</p> <p>Mr Morpuss submitted that New Balance had \u201cpretend(ed) they can match so they can pay the lower fee, but not actually match\u201d, and said the company had \u201ca record of telling Liverpool things that were wrong\u201d.</p> <p>In written submissions, Mr Morpuss said the club \u201cfrequently complained to New Balance\u201d about its \u201crepeated distribution failings over a seven-year period\u201d.</p> <p>He argued that New Balance\u2019s claim to be able to match Nike\u2019s 6,000-store offer was \u201cinconsistent with New Balance\u2019s historic performance\u201d and \u201cmanifestly implausible\u201d, adding that the company had used \u201ca series of artificial devices to pretend that it could reach the 6,000 figure\u201d.</p> <p>Mr Morpuss said that many of the 6,000 stores New Balance claimed it could stock Liverpool kit in only sold footwear, giving the example that 250 of the proposed new 307 stores in Japan were \u201cfor accounts to carry footwear only\u201d.</p> <p>He submitted: \u201cThe above are not the actions of a party to a relational contract seeking in good faith to double its distribution.</p> <p>\u201cThey are the actions of a party seeking cynically to put small amounts of non-core LFC products into as many stores as possible so as to be able to argue that artificially it has satisfied a requirement to have LFC products in 6,000 stores.\u201d</p> <p>The hearing is due to conclude on Tuesday and Mr Justice Teare is expected to reserve his judgment.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5da9d0078f08c78d1cb4e7a0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-18T14:45:58.973Z\">3.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Here\u2019s a preview of that Kant\u00e9-less encounter at Stamford Bridge. </strong><br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/18/chelsea-newcastle-match-preview-premier-league\">Chelsea v Newcastle United: match preview</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5da9cd3a8f08993584c89266\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-18T14:35:26.601Z\">3.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>It has been reported by Sky</strong> that Krasimir Balakov, Bulgaria\u2019s coach, has resigned after Monday\u2019s match against England in the wake of the racism incidents that almost led to the game being abandoned.

      "bodyText": "Jo\u00ebl Matip has signed a new contract at Liverpool, described as a \u2018long-term deal\u2019 in the club\u2019s official release but reported to be for five years. \u201cIt\u2019s a great feeling to be a longer part of the club,\u201d the central defender said. \u201cIt\u2019s really just a great feeling.\u201d And that concludes the blog for the day. Thanks for reading and thanks to Gregg for his sterling efforts before. Pep Guardiola has been complaining that English clubs play a lot at Christmas, and his Manchester City team in particular. Due to TV scheduling, City will kick off against Sheffield United on December 29 just 44 hours after the final whistle in their game against Wolves on December 27. Quoth Pep: \u201cSince I came here every season it\u2019s happened the same. The broadcasters are the bosses in this situation.I love to play on Boxing Days, in wintertime, when everybody is stopped and families, kids go into the stadium and enjoy the game. I like it. But the problem is the same. We don\u2019t protect the players, the system doesn\u2019t protect the players. It is too much, honestly, it is too much.\u201d Only Newcastle and Manchester City have lost to Norwich this season. More on Bulgaria\u2019s \u2018handling\u2019 of Monday\u2019s racism in Sofia. The Fiver is here. The Fiver is here. The Fiver is here. Time for the football romantics\u2019 corner of love, as per PA Media. Or Filthy Lucre Corner, to give its full name. A multimillion-pound sponsorship dispute between Liverpool FC and sportswear giant New Balance has reached the High Court. The club is being sued over its alleged refusal to honour the terms of its reported \u00a340 million-a-year deal with the company, which expires in May 2020. Under the terms of the deal, New Balance is entitled to renew its sponsorship if it matches the terms of any competitor\u2019s offer to sponsor Liverpool kit. But the current European champions, who have been offered a \u00a330 million-a-year five-year deal by American sportswear giant Nike, argue that New Balance cannot match Nike\u2019s offer in relation to the marketing and distribution of Liverpool products. Opening New Balance\u2019s case on Friday, Daniel Oudkerk QC said his client was \u201cone of the world\u2019s leading sports footwear and apparel manufacturers with annual revenues exceeding three billion US dollars\u201d. He added that Liverpool, who are currently top of the Premier League, \u201chas enjoyed very significant success on the pitch\u201d in recent seasons, which he said had been reflected in record sales. \u201cIt is anticipated that the club\u2019s home kit will once again be the club\u2019s highest selling kit at 2.9 million units (sold),\u201d he told the court. Mr Oudkerk told Mr Justice Teare that the key issue in the case was whether New Balance had matched \u201cthe material, measurable and matchable terms of a third-party offer\u201d. Liverpool argues that New Balance has not matched Nike\u2019s offer, which includes a commitment to sell licensed products in \u201cnot less than 6,000 stores worldwide, 500 of which shall be Nike owned\u201d. But Mr Oudkerk said New Balance has \u201capproximately 40,000-odd retail doors globally\u201d. Mr Oudkerk submitted that, after the club received Nike\u2019s offer in June, it initially refused to disclose the terms of the offer in order to get New Balance to \u201ceffectively bid blind\u201d - and then proposed terms \u201cbased upon a \u00a360 million annual payment\u201d. In his written case, Mr Oudkerk argued that Liverpool dismissed New Balance\u2019s offer to match terms as the club was \u201cwedded to Nike\u201d, and that \u201cit appears that the club had resolved to reject the New Balance match come what may\u201d. He added that Liverpool \u201cappears to have considered the renewal option inconvenient\u201d, pointing to a WhatsApp message between two of the club\u2019s directors in which one said the clause \u201cjust absolutely screws us\u201d. Guy Morpuss QC, representing the club, argued that the claim was \u201creally an attempt by New Balance to use a matching clause for a purpose for which it was never intended\u201d. He said New Balance\u2019s contention it could distribute Liverpool kit to 40,000 stores was \u201ca myth\u201d, adding that the company had \u201cgrossly overstated\u201d the number of stores it could distribute to. Opening Liverpool\u2019s case, he said: \u201cWe make no secret of the fact that we were trying to use Nike\u2019s (offer) ... as a stick to beat New Balance with to try and get a higher fee out of them.\u201d Mr Morpuss added that that was an \u201centirely legitimate commercial tactic\u201d. He said that \u201cwhat New Balance needed to do if it was not going to offer us the additional money, up its annual fee, was it needed to actually come forward and genuinely match the terms that Nike offered\u201d. He said the \u201cmain point\u201d in issue was \u201ccould they (New Balance) match the distribution that Nike was offering: 6,000 stores, 500 of which were owned and operated by New Balance?\u201d \u201cThe idea that New Balance would even get football kit into anything close to those 40,000 stores is utterly fanciful,\u201d Mr Morpuss said. He explained that, under the terms of its offer, \u201cNike was paying us a lower fee than New Balance (but) Nike is guaranteeing distribution and it is paying us a royalty\u201d of 20% of net sales of Liverpool products. Mr Morpuss submitted that New Balance had \u201cpretend(ed) they can match so they can pay the lower fee, but not actually match\u201d, and said the company had \u201ca record of telling Liverpool things that were wrong\u201d. In written submissions, Mr Morpuss said the club \u201cfrequently complained to New Balance\u201d about its \u201crepeated distribution failings over a seven-year period\u201d. He argued that New Balance\u2019s claim to be able to match Nike\u2019s 6,000-store offer was \u201cinconsistent with New Balance\u2019s historic performance\u201d and \u201cmanifestly implausible\u201d, adding that the company had used \u201ca series of artificial devices to pretend that it could reach the 6,000 figure\u201d. Mr Morpuss said that many of the 6,000 stores New Balance claimed it could stock Liverpool kit in only sold footwear, giving the example that 250 of the proposed new 307 stores in Japan were \u201cfor accounts to carry footwear only\u201d. He submitted: \u201cThe above are not the actions of a party to a relational contract seeking in good faith to double its distribution. \u201cThey are the actions of a party seeking cynically to put small amounts of non-core LFC products into as many stores as possible so as to be able to argue that artificially it has satisfied a requirement to have LFC products in 6,000 stores.\u201d The hearing is due to conclude on Tuesday and Mr Justice Teare is expected to reserve his judgment. Here\u2019s a preview of that Kant\u00e9-less encounter at Stamford Bridge. It has been reported by Sky that Krasimir Balakov, Bulgaria\u2019s coach, has resigned after Monday\u2019s match against England in the wake of the racism incidents that almost led to the game being abandoned. Balakov, in post-match, denied that any such incidents took place. Borislav Mihaylov has also confirmed he is resigning from his role as president of the Bulgarian Football Union, while in another development, Sky Sports News understands the entire BFU Executive Committee has stepped down. Wolves are bang in form, while Saints most definitely are not. Here\u2019s the preview for their match tomorrow. Frank Lampard\u2019s Chelsea are not happy that N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 will not be able to play for Frank Lampard\u2019s Chelsea this weekend after getting injured while playing for Didier Deschamps\u2019 France. Some harsh words from Super Frank for the man he succeeded in the Chelsea midfield back in 2001. Here\u2019s a turn-up for the books, as found by colleague and Leyton Orient ultra Martin Belam. Going to a different game to the one you were supposed to is a real rite of passage for any football fan. Poor, poor Ole has had to issue his latest declaration that he is the right man to be Manchester United manager. It\u2019s all getting a bit sad. Unless you\u2019ve been living under a rock for the past fortnight you\u2019ve probably heard that Liverpool will match Manchester City\u2019s 18-game run of successive wins if they beat Manchester United on Sunday. It would be a remarkable achievement for Klopp\u2019s side but Paul Wilson thinks it would also be a sign that the Premier League\u2019s USP \u2013 it\u2019s competitive nature \u2013 is not all it\u2019s cracked up to be. Right, I\u2019m handing over to John Brewin now. He will guide you into the weekend. Thanks for your emails. Bye. Two freewheeling teams meet at Villa Park. Here\u2019s your Aston Villa v Brighton match preview: \u201cI\u2019d like to see a behind-the-scenes documentary on Newcastle\u2019s 2008-09 season when Kevin Keegan quit due to Mike Ashley and his cronies\u2019 meddling,\u201d writes Ben Blatch-Hanlon. \u201cThat, the appointment of Joe Kinnear, the ultimately-futile decision to bring in Alan Shearer to try and rescue them from relegation \u2026 plus any chance for further public airing of just how awful Ashley has been for Newcastle is always welcome.\u201d A fine choice Ben. Roy Hodgson reckons no one should read too much in to his Crystal Palace impressive side\u2019s start to the season that has lifted them up to sixth. They face all five teams ahead of them in the next five games. Gulp! I don\u2019t think Pep needs to worry about any team he faces but it will be nice if he shows us respect. We know we are going to be stretched, we know it is going to be a challenge but we are very up for that challenge. You can only do what you can do with the games that have been put in front of you. We face a tough period of games. We are going to be hard stretched going forwards so it is going to be hard to keep that point accumulation up. We have a little bit of a cushion. You are going to get periods like this during the season. You always get spells, it is up to us to produce the level of football we think we can produce and keep picking up points.\u201d If you could watch a behind-the-scenes documentary of any season in history, which one would it be? I would have quite liked to have seen just what the hell was going on at Palermo in 2015-16, when they went through eight managers (I think), including the same boss twice. Under-pressure Everton manager Marco Silva reckons the home match against West Ham is a \u201cmust-win\u201d game that can be a turning point for his troubled Toffees, who lie 18th in the Premier League. For us as a club all the matches must be must-win matches. That is the mentality we are trying to create. It has to be a turning point for us, because we have all the conditions to do that, full confidence in our players to be able to play in our stadium as well, and I think it is a good start to the match, thinking of it like a must-win. At the moment we are not in the best moment with confidence really high, but we have to go for this match thinking it will be a must-win game. And here\u2019s your match pack for Crystal Palace v Manchester City: Get your Leicester v Burnley match preview, right here: Well, this could be an interesting season to document. Maybe it will have footage of the cosy dinner Poch spoke about being invited to yesterday: When you receive a text from the player inviting you and the coaching staff for a dinner only two things can happen. [It\u2019s] because they want to say goodbye. Or because they feel that they love you and they want to show that they are with you. And I think it\u2019s the second. Frank Lampard has confirmed that N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 is not fit to face Newcastle \u2013 and he\u2019s not happy with France that the player was not released back to Chelsea earlier for treatment: We communicated before the first international break. It was clear that he wasn\u2019t fit to play the second game and he sat on the bench. I think it could have been handled better. I understand that when a player is on international duty that they are their players, but it was clear that he wasn\u2019t fit. Perhaps it is just to spice up the buildup to Sunday\u2019s match, but Sky are reporting that Manchester United will make a serious attempt to sign Emre Can in January. Can has hardly played for Juventus this season and was furious after being left out of their Champions League squad. On the up side, all that spare time has allowed him to pick some autumn essentials: Ryan Grubb has emailed in with an opinion/admission. \u201cI agree about playing Adrian on Sunday. While Alisson is a far superior player it will take a while for him to get back up to speed. The nightmare of under hit backpasses with Rashford bearing down on him woke me up in the middle of the last night. Not the worst hypothetical football dream I have had but certainly not the best. Perfectly normal for a grown man to still dream about football, am I right?\u201d of course it\u2019s all right. I still dream of scoring in front of the Kop. I\u2019m 40 years old. Meanwhile, Hubert O\u2019Hearn is a worried man: The other subject that made Guardiola animated was the release of the Christmas fixture schedule, which has given City three games, against Wolves, Sheffield United and Everton, in six days. Liverpool, meanwhile, have Leicester, Wolves and Sheffield United over eight days. It is what it is. Since I came here it happened the same. The concept is not about in this period. I love to play on Boxing Day and at winter when families and kids can go to the stadium and enjoy it. The problem is the system doesn\u2019t protect the players. Another day we will have more recovery than the other ones. It is what it is. Maybe the broadcasters are fans of other clubs. If we have to play tomorrow, we have to play tomorrow. We have to play, we\u2019re going to play. Pep Guardiola was in enigmatic form in his press conference. He seemed non-plussed by many of the footballing questions he was asked but did confirm that Kevin De Bruyne is fit again and Benjamin Mendy is training but won\u2019t return against Crystal Palace. Sergio Ag\u00fcero is fine but \u201cthe car is not\u201d he also says. He was most animated when asked about the protests in Barcelona: Millions of people would not work to give support to the people. The international community must help us to solve the situation in Spain. Personal friends [of mine] are in jail for nine years for asking to vote. Hopefully, Europe can make a step forward and help us. Daniel Farke will want to see a reaction from his Norwich players after the 5-1 humbling at home by Aston Villa. He has Tim Krul available again and confirmed he will play at the Vitality Stadium. \u201cThe injury situation is much better. Tim Krul will play tomorrow. Kenny McLean and Todd Cantwell are available. Max Aarons returned without any problems. Sam Byram\u2019s ankle problems are sorted so he\u2019s available. Alex Tettey is back and available, so is Tom Trybull. Also available is Onel Hernandez,\u201d he confirmed. On his team\u2019s horror show against Villa and how they will respond, he said: We will be much more competitive than we were two weeks ago. If you lose a game you always want to get back on the pitch, but the break helped us because we had so many problems. Onel Hern\u00e1ndez was our best winger in terms of goals and assists last season, so he\u2019s been a big miss for us. The break helped us to settle and recover, so it came at the right moment. We know there are tough days when you have so many problems at this level. We\u2019re probably favourites for position 20 in the league, but we won\u2019t accept that. I agree we have conceded too many goals, I\u2019m not naive. You have to be solid in defending, whether you play football 20 years ago or now. It\u2019s not easy for the players who have to defend who aren\u2019t used to playing those roles, or playing through pain. And here\u2019s Klopp on the racist abuse that England\u2019s players were subjected to in Bulgaria: The [England] players showed on the pitch a sensational response. You want to show the right reaction and make them suffer in the right way. It\u2019s not important who laughs first. It\u2019s important who laughs last and the players did that. [The racism] was disgusting. Nobody wants to see that. J\u00fcrgen Klopp has not been impressed with how much his Liverpool team has been built up before the visit to Manchester United. He\u2019s talking about you Danny Mills! When you make a combined line-up and have 11 players of Liverpool - it\u2019s like a joke, like building a banana skin. The world at the moment is a circus and we are at the centre. I\u2019m not influenced by it. I am 100% sure of the strength of Man Utd. I\u2019m quite optimistic we have a chance. History in this case is not important but it gives us a sign. We like to create and use atmosphere in our stadium which is incredibly helpful but Old Trafford is not too bad in that respect. They will be on their toes. I don\u2019t think there are lot of teams who want to play against us at the moment. Klopp saw off Mourinho with Liverpool\u2019s 3-0 defeat of Manchester United last season. On Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s job security, he has this to say: I have no clue about his position. I don\u2019t have an opinion about that. Man Utd is a massive club and nobody is really ready to wait. With all the things you said about them in the last few weeks it has no influence on them. They are desperate to change the situation. It\u2019s not important what you write. It\u2019s important what the board and Woodward tell him. I have no opinion. I\u2019d like every manager in the world to have as much time as possible to change things. But you can\u2019t compare situations to when I came in and he did. We will hear from J\u00fcrgen Klopp shortly. Hopefully, he is in better form than he was in training recently. Right, I\u2019m fed and watered. Thanks to John for the cover. Chelsea go into their home game against Newcastle on the back of four wins on the bounce in all competitions. No wonder Frank Lampard has a spring in his step: I feel like we are moving in the right direction but I always get nervous saying it because it is a catalyst for over confidence. The last month was good and we had some good results. The international break always worries you slightly because will we forget the good things we were doing that made us get good results and we can\u2019t forget the fact we can do much more. It\u2019s competitive at the top of the league and I don\u2019t think the league has given itself and real form yet other than Liverpool who are deservedly right up there and City but the rest of us are trying to bridge that gap. Mauricio Pochettino became a fan of Ingerlund, or those Tottenham players of his who were playing for them last week in the international break. Pochettino was pleased Harry Kane and Harry Winks were able to enjoy the winning feeling again. Kane, got three assists and a goal against Bulgaria, and Winks was handed a start in midfield. After the disappointment on Friday, it was good for England, Southgate, the coaching staff and of course the players to feel that confidence,\u201d he said. It was fantastic for them to finish with a great result and to build their confidence. Of course, it was a tough game after Czech Republic and people were down. For our players, it continues the negative dynamic. I was hating watching the game thinking, \u2018We need to win, we need to win\u2019, putting on my England shirt! After Friday, it was tough but then Monday was better. The best medicine is to score, assist, feel the victory and for sure that is going to help our team. Spurs host winless Watford on Saturday. It\u2019s going to be tough. We will fight against us, play against us. We are our own worst enemy,\u201d he said. Then after the opponent. I am so happy, the players react in a very good mood. We have talked a lot, individuals and collective. I was talking with the staff in a very honest conversation as always in these situations, trying to find the best way. In the end our interest is Tottenham. Our objective is to put Tottenham in the place that Tottenham deserve to be. Sid Lowe spoke to Manchester City\u2019s Welsh-sounding Spanish anchorman. Right, I\u2019m off to grab some lunch. I\u2019ll leave you with John Brewin while I\u2019m gone. If you like numbers in the blocky colourful form that kind of tell you things, this might be up your street: Could this be the last Everton match Marco Silva takes charge of? In case you missed it last weekend, Andy Hunter wrote a great piece about Silva\u2019s Everton woes, which worsened when his long-time assistant manager Jo\u00e3o Pedro Sousa left to manage Famalic\u00e3o in Portugal. Famalic\u00e3o\u2019s rise to the top of Primeira Liga is evidence of just how influential he was in Silva\u2019s team and how much he has been missed. Here\u2019s the story on the postponement of Barcelona v Real Madrid: We\u2019ve not heard from J\u00fcrgen Klopp yet but one of the questions I expect he will be asked is whether he will bring Alisson back into goal at Old Trafford. I think he might be minded to stick with Adri\u00e1n for this one. As good as Alisson is, Klopp may be tempted to keep things exactly as as they are for such a big match in case Alisson suffers from a little bit of ring-rustiness. Maybe it\u2019s less risky to bring him back in at Anfield, though the next game there against Spurs is hardly a routine one. Five more men have been arrested over the racist behaviour which marred England\u2019s Euro 2012 qualifier against Bulgaria. The five men were detained at the First District police station in Sofia while a further five were searched at a different precinct in the Bulgarian capital, taking the total number identified to 16, a spokeswoman for the ministry of the interior told the PA news agency. Six supporters were arrested on Wednesday, with four already having been banned from attending any sporting event for the next two years and fined 1,000 lev (around \u00a3440). One individual faces a pre-trial hearing on Friday and could be remanded in custody. Watford manager Quique Sanchez Flores claims there is no panic over the club\u2019s poor start to the season. Sanchez Flores was brought back to Vicarage Road last month after the team, then under the stewardship of Javi Gracia, claimed just one point in their opening four Premier League games. Yet the Spaniard claims it is far too early to be writing off his rock-bottom side after they have taken only two points in four league games since. \u201cI don\u2019t like to talk about that. This really is a big problem in football sometimes \u2013 [people] regard seasons finish in September-November,\u201d he said. \u201cBut to finish the season is in May. It\u2019s 30 games ahead. So it\u2019s impossible to think about what would happen. The only thing we can do is to work on the opposite side - not thinking that it was finished.\u201d And with Watford taking on Tottenham on Saturday, he also had some nice things to say about Mauricio Pochettino, who has been feeling the pressure himself after the 3-0 defeat at Brighton: Of course now is this is a difficult moment for him and for the team but for me he is best coach in the last four years. Everyone knows how tough Tottenham are. Just remember three months ago they were playing in the final of the Champions League. Stephen Phone reminds us all that the M62 exists: \u201cWhy are they always on about the East Lancs Road? They know there\u2019s a big eff off motorway connecting the cities now right (although admittedly less handy for getting to Anfield)? I feel an early goal for the Pool tomorrow may open the floodgates. I just don\u2019t see Man Utd being able to dig in. But then again I always want an early goal yet somehow this Liverpool keep calm and just grind out the results. Almost as if they\u2019re mentally prepared better and secure if the knowledge that they are better than most other teams and will find a way. Cheerio!\u201d Let\u2019s be honest, you want some Rob Smyth or Scott Murray to read to get you in the mood for a Manchester United match. So, here\u2019s Rob on why Solskj\u00e6r deserves more R-E-S-P-E-C-T at United: And enjoy this Joy of Six by Scott Murray from 11 years ago on some great ding-dong battles down the years, including my personal favourite, Liverpool 3-3 Manchester United from 4 January 1994. The FA has announced that AFC Wimbledon manager Wally Downes has been fined \u00a33,000 and suspended from all football and football-related activity until 14 November, after admitting breaching FA betting rules. Downes placed five bets on matches between 30 November 2013 and 30 January 2014, and three bets between 16 March 2019 and 12 July 2019. Sky are giving Manchester United v Liverpool a huge buildup: a \u201cTWO DAYS TO GO\u201d countdown clock, a divide-crossing commentator in Paul Ince and mention of just how many miles down the East Lancs Road Liverpool is from Manchester every other minute. It\u2019s going to be 0-0 again isn\u2019t it? Leicester take on Burnley on Saturday and much of the talk before the game has been about James Maddison\u2019s visit to a casino after being released by England because he was ill. Criticism of Maddison is ridiculous but that\u2019s what happens when modern football meets Twitter. Brendan Rodgers has been defending the player: The kid went away with the international team and took ill while he was away. He wanted to stay and hopefully be ready for the second game. But the England medical staff \u2013 which I can understand, as he had flu and they didn\u2019t want that to spread to his teammates \u2013 decided it\u2019s best for him to leave the camp. So he leaves, gets some tablets with our guys at the club, then he feels better. He watched the game at home on his own on the Friday and then goes out at half-time \u2013 probably he\u2019ll make better decisions in his life but he went to a casino on his own to sit and watch the second half by a poker table. The suggestions are he left England purposelessly and then goes to a casino but that\u2019s totally not the case at all. But his eyes have been opened now to the wider world in terms of what he did. He knows in hindsight he\u2019s made a mistake. Some big news from Spain, where the first Cl\u00e1sico of the season, which had been scheduled to take place at Camp Nou on 26 October, has been postponed because of fears of civil unrest amid pro-independence protests in Catalonia. La Liga organisers had proposed that Barcelona v Real Madrid be moved to the Bernab\u00e9u, an idea that was not received well by the Spanish champions, but the match has been put back to a later date now. We\u2019ll have a story on this shortly from our Spanish correspondent, Sid Lowe, who had hinted earlier that a more likely date for the game to be played was in the week before Christmas. The clubs must agree a new date for the match to take place before Monday. Of course, it was Newcastle United\u2019s Matty Longstaff who inflicted the 1-0 defeat on Manchester United before the international break. Steve Bruce says he\u2019s minded to start Matty Longstaff again when Newcastle travel to Chelsea. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve witnessed as good a debut, not just because he scored the goal that caps it off but it was the whole way he played in the whole game. It was terrific. Well, you can imagine what the kid\u2019s been like - it\u2019s like a kid in a sweet shop. It\u2019s been quite refreshing for all of us to witness the interview. That\u2019s why I picked him. His interview beamed out of the television, what he\u2019s all about. It brought a refreshing humility to us all again and it was a wonderful debut from the kid. The Longstaff brothers are what this world needs right now! If you want more heartwarming words on the Geordie duo, read this piece by Louise Taylor, who spoke to them recently. Solskj\u00e6r also confirmed that David de Gea is not likely to feature against Liverpool but his injury is not as severe as they thought it might be. I don\u2019t expect him to play but it wasn\u2019t as bad as feared. When I saw the game I thought he would be out until the next international break, because we\u2019ve had some long-term muscle injuries. On the subject of Paul Pogba being photographed talking to Zinedine Zidane, Solskj\u00e6r had this to say: He\u2019s recovering, he\u2019s mending, he\u2019s been on a few days off working but he\u2019s away from here, and it\u2019s a pic, when you\u2019re at Manchester United I don\u2019t have any problem with that at all. Paul is part of our plan, he\u2019s been playing through the pain barriers and has been criticised left, right and centre. But when he came back [against] Rochdale and Arsenal he wanted to play \u2014 was too painful, he had that scan, he\u2019s on the way back. Paul Pogba is definitely out of the match with an ongoing ankle issue but Anthony Martial and Aaron Wan-Bissaka could return against Liverpool with question marks hanging over the likes of Jesse Lingard, Phil Jones, Luke Shaw, Diogo Dalot and Mason Greenwood. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r has been speaking in his press conference to preview the match against Liverpool on Sunday. He was asked a question about the direction the club is taking under him and he was honest enough to say that by trying to bring through younger players, the club is suffering at the moment but that he doesn\u2019t think the Manchester United job is one he can\u2019t handle. No, I\u2019ve never felt it\u2019s too big for me. I\u2019m confident in what we\u2019re trying to do and with my staff, I\u2019ve been so impressed. The improvement is there to see. We need to start winning games, start scoring goals and we need to create more chances because at the back we\u2019ve looked solid. But we haven\u2019t been adventurous enough and taken enough risks. The best teams around take more risks and more runs in behind. Maybe the boys when they lose confidence they play safe and it\u2019s my duty to say it\u2019s not safety. I speak to Ed [Woodward] loads of times and we speak regularly. We\u2019ve spoken so many times. We do have a plan and we have made some decisions in the short-term that would harm us, but in the long-term would benefit us and that\u2019s part of the plan. Results are always the main thing and we can move forward quicker with results and performances. I am sure we will get there. But there\u2019s planning for the next transfer window and summer transfer window. In the Scottish Premiership, Celtic have the chance to leapfrog Rangers at the top of the league when they play Ross County on Saturday before Hearts host Rangers on Sunday. Rangers will be on a high after Steven Gerrard and striker Alfredo Morelos scooped the manager of the month and player of the month awards for September. Gerrard spent the international break turning out for Rangers legends against Liverpool. Rangers legend? Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe has had his say on the racist abuse suffered by England\u2019s players in Bulgaria. Cherries striker Callum Wilson was the subject of abuse in Sofia but Howe believes Wilson has not been affected by it: It was incredibly disappointing to see. I watched it live, It was a tough watch. You could sense what was happening. Callum and the rest off the England players handled it with real class. Callum\u2019s fine. He\u2019s a strong character. Unfortunately it\u2019s nothing new for him to have to deal with. Mentally, he\u2019s fine. Aston Villa and Brighton meet on Saturday having both enjoyed morale-boosting wins before the international break. Villa thrashed Norwich 5-1 at Carrow Road, while Brighton put a discombobulated Spurs to the sword with a 3-0 home win. Villa will be missing midfielder Jota, who has had surgery to repair a hernia, while Brighton have a healthy squad to choose from after Leandro Trossard and Shane Duffy stepped up their recoveries and are now available after injury. Villa manager Dean Smith says he is wary of the threat posed by Seagulls teenager Aaron Connolly, who scored twice against Spurs: We\u2019ll have to watch out for him. He\u2019s a player with huge potential, he\u2019s certainly hit the ground running with his first start and two goals against the Champions League finalists. Our defenders will know enough about him certainly for the game on Saturday. This league can punish you in the flash of an eye. It would have been very easy for me to walk into the dressing room after the (Norwich win) and say, \u2018right, I\u2019ll see you on Friday\u2019. No, it was, \u2018keep to the plan. Sunday, Monday off, work Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday\u2019. Meanwhile, Villa striker Wesley has been enjoying some sightseeing on his time off: There\u2019s no doubt that Manchester United v Liverpool is the weekend\u2019s biggest game but not since the mid 1980s has the gap between the two sides been weighted in Liverpool\u2019s favour as much as it is before Sunday\u2019s 4.30pm kick-off. Leaders Liverpool are 15 points clear of 12th-placed United after only eight games. Ed Woodward has admitted that the club\u2019s recruitment policy has been dysfunctional since Alex Ferguson\u2019s departure. Both clubs have US owners. David Conn has done a forensic job of investigating the Glazers\u2019 running of Manchester United and compared it to the job being done by Fenway Sports Group at Anfield. If you\u2019re a United fan, it will get your blood pressure up: Hello. So the Premier League returns after the international break \u2013 and what an intriguing weekend we have in store. The results two weeks ago have left so many questions lingering. How will Manchester City respond after their shock defeat by Wolves? Will Liverpool see off Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r at Manchester United? Will Marco Silva be sacked if Everton don\u2019t beat West Ham? Can Brighton build on their 3-0 win over Spurs? And Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s side aren\u2019t so low on confidence that they will lose at home to rock-bottom Watford, are they? Our writers have set it all out for you in much more comprehensive style in our Premier League weekend preview piece here. Go on, have a read: I\u2019ll bring you the injury news and more as the day\u2019s press conferences swing into action where I\u2019m sure some managers will have something to say about the appalling racist abuse of England\u2019s players when they played against Bulgaria last week, too, as well as their empowered and hugely impressive response to it. The full list of fixtures are as follows: Saturday (3pm BST unless stated otherwise) Everton v West Ham (12.30pm) Bournemouth v Norwich Aston Villa v Brighton Chelsea v Newcastle Leicester v Burnley Tottenham v Watford Wolves v Southampton Crystal Palace v Manchester City (5.30pm) Sunday Manchester United v Liverpool (4.30pm)",

      "bodyText": "The energy regulator has been accused by Scottish Power of hindering the UK\u2019s electric vehicle rollout due to its \u201ccolossal disconnect\u201d with Britain\u2019s climate policies. Keith Anderson, the chief executive of the \u201cbig six\u201d energy company, said businesses in the sector could do more to help the UK become a carbon neutral economy, but efforts are being held back by Ofgem\u2019s outdated regulation. The Guardian revealed earlier this year that Ofgem\u2019s remit as regulator has remained unchanged since 2011, despite the growing public concern over the climate crisis and new legislation to establish a carbon neutral economy by 2050. The regulator refused to allow Scottish Power to invest an extra \u00a342m in upgrading its networks in Scotland and the north-west of England to prepare for rising demand for electric vehicles chargers. Ofgem said customers should not have to foot the bill for the company\u2019s plans because the proposal does not offer enough evidence for how much car charging capacity will be used in future. The decision has reignited concern that Ofgem\u2019s existing mandate, which aims to protect energy customers, does not factor in the need for long-term investment to cut carbon emissions. \u201cThere is a colossal disconnect between government policy and the regulator\u2019s policy,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cWe have a government willing to invest money in electric vehicles ahead of time, and an industry regulator sitting back and saying, \u2018No, we don\u2019t think so.\u2019 But the government has set a 2050 climate target, and a ban on combustion engine vehicles by 2040 which could come forward to 2035. This is going to happen.\u201d Ofgem said delivering a zero emissions economy is one of its \u201ckey priorities\u201d, and it has already ensured energy networks are well-funded to accommodate low carbon demand such as electric vehicles. \u201cIf Scottish Power can adequately demonstrate the investment that is needed they may be able to reapply at a later date,\u201d a spokeswoman said. The National Infrastructure Commission (NIC) warned last week that the UK will fail to meet its climate targets unless Ofgem is given new responsibilities to support climate action. The government\u2019s infrastructure tsars said ministers need to update the mandate for energy, water and telecoms regulators to dismantle the \u201cculture of short-termism\u201d that undermines the long-term investment decisions needed to tackle the climate crisis. Sir John Armitt, the chair of the NIC, said: \u201cIf ministers are serious about a low-carbon revolution, they must act quickly and decisively to modernise regulation.\u201d The Energy Networks Association added that including a climate change mandate in Ofgem\u2019s regulatory duties would be \u201ca major step forward\u201d to help ensure that the UK \u201ctakes the smartest, most innovative approach to delivering decarbonisation\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Trevor Noah \u201cIf you were keeping up with the news today, you know that it was more chaotic than free cocaine day at Dave and Buster\u2019s,\u201d said Trevor Noah on Thursday\u2019s Daily Show. There were simply too many stories vying for attention, which Noah skimmed in a segment called \u201cAin\u2019t Nobody Got Time for That\u201d. \u201cIf you\u2019re friends with a government ethics expert and you\u2019re wondering why their head randomly exploded into little pieces today,\u201d Noah began, it\u2019s probably because they saw that Donald Trump announced that his Florida golf resort will host next year\u2019s G7 summit. The arrangement violates ethics rules on profiting off foreign governments but, as Noah noted, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing Trump won\u2019t do to profit off the presidency. I bet you he\u2019s going to be outside his own impeachment trial just scalping tickets.\u201d Under normal circumstances, \u201cwe would spend all our time talking about how shady it is that Trump is forcing world leaders to host the G7 summit at his golf club that he makes money from\u201d, Noah said. But yesterday was not a normal day, and it\u2019s not a normal presidency. \u201cBecause while he\u2019s inviting foreign leaders to his Miami golf club, American leaders are storming out of the White House,\u201d Noah said in reference to Trump\u2019s meeting with Democrats in Washington. The meeting spiraled downward as both Trump and the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, described each other as having a \u201cmeltdown\u201d. This was overshadowed, however, by Mike Pence\u2019s trip to Turkey, where the vice-president negotiated a five-day ceasefire on the Turkish invasion of northern Syria. (Trump virtually facilitated the move when he surprise removed US troops last week, abandoning America\u2019s Kurdish allies.) \u201cIf we had the time, we would be discussing how disingenuous it is of Trump to claim that this is a peace deal when in fact the Kurds just got screwed over,\u201d said Noah. \u201cBecause the deal is that they have five days to leave the land, and then Turkey gets the land.\u201d The ceasefire \u201cdoesn\u2019t sound like a deal\u201d, Noah continued. \u201cIt sounds like the kind of deal I had with my high school bully \u2013 I would give him my lunch money, and he would give me a black eye.

      "bodyText": "\u2018Nuke Mars!\u201d tweeted Elon Musk in August this year. Having launched a car into orbit and developed a self-landing rocket, the billionaire SpaceX founder seems to have set his sights on bombing the red planet. \u201cT-shirt soon,\u201d he added. But it wasn\u2019t just another drug-induced whim. Musk has been contemplating the idea since 2015. By nuking the sky over the Martian poles every couple of seconds, he thinks he could create two tiny pulsing \u201csuns\u201d that would melt the ice and release vast amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. It would essentially create an instant greenhouse effect, raising the temperature and air pressure of the planet \u2013 climate change on demand from the man who marketed flamethrowers for torching marshmallows. A rotating vision of Musk\u2019s Mars, looking like a smudgy brown version of the Earth, is now on display in the Design Museum, as part of a new exhibition about our lusty relationship with the fourth rock from the sun, provocatively titled Moving to Mars. \u201cWe\u2019ve been successfully putting landers on Mars since 1976,\u201d says chief curator Justin McGuirk, \u201cbut people are a different prospect. The human factor changes the conversation from a purely engineering question to one of design. Keeping people alive and sane in a capsule for the seven months it takes to get there is just the start.\u201d The show takes a broad look at the subject, ranging from attempts to map the planet by 19th-century astronomers, to proposed 3D-printed habitats and even speculative Martian fashions. It is intended to be the museum\u2019s most family-friendly exhibition to date, with activity briefs set for each section and a fun model spaceship hideout where kids can be occupied while parents study fascinating archive material. It\u2019s an accessible introduction to the questions of space habitation, without dumbing down. Ever since Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli identified the outlines of seas and continents inscribed across the planet\u2019s surface in 1877, we have longed to believe there was some form of life on Mars. His use of the word \u201ccanali\u201d, meaning channels, set off a \u201ccanal craze\u201d, fuelling dreams of an ancient civilisation that might have once carved these waterways through the red rock. His beguiling maps of the planet, on show in the exhibition, depict islands with names such as Elysium and Utopia, connected by a radial network of channels \u2013 an urban pattern echoed in Musk\u2019s plans for a Martian colony later in the show. Quite how many themes and ideas have persisted through the ages is a recurring theme.

      "body": "<p>How far Justin Trudeau\u2019s star has fallen. In 2015, the rise of this hopey-changey wunderkind was supposed to usher in a bold new Canadian era: democratic reform, ambitious climate action, a plan to tackle inequality, and a new, respectful relationship with Indigenous peoples. But his Liberal party\u2019s bid for re-election, ahead of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/13/canada-election-of-discontent-race-environment-young-voters-gulf\" title=\"\">election on Monday</a>, looks altogether different: this campaign is dominated by warnings, in ominous tones, about the threat posed by a resurgent, rightwing Conservative party.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/18/canada-election-justin-trudeau-young-voters-jagmeet-singh-andrew-scheer\">Canada election: can Trudeau excite young voters let down by broken promises?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It\u2019s not hard to understand why. Trudeau\u2019s leftwing posturing has been exposed as a sham. His widely hyped tax hike on the richest 1% was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/03/justin-trudeau-phony-war-against-inequality\" title=\"\">actually a giveaway</a> to the next richest 10% of Canadians. His embrace of a carbon tax became a cover for frenzied approval of fossil fuel projects, culminating in his purchase of a C$4.5bn (US$3.45bn) tar sands pipeline. He dispatched heavily armed police to violently dismantle a peaceful blockade of Indigenous land defenders. He made Canada the <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/canada-now-the-second-biggest-arms-exporter-to-middle-east-data-show/article30459788/\" title=\"\">second largest weapons dealer</a> to the Middle East, arming the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/13/canadian-government-lied-over-12bn-arms-sale-to-saudi-arabia\" title=\"\">Saudi war on Yemen</a>. And he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/14/trudeau-broke-ethics-law-in-snc-lavalin-case-watchdog-rules\" title=\"\">pressured his own justice minister</a> to exempt a well-connected and corrupt engineering giant from a criminal trial. Beholden to powerful vested interests, Trudeau promised big but delivered small.</p> \n<p>And so the energy he rode to power has evaporated. Trudeaumania, as one analyst put it, has been replaced by Trudeau-meh-nia. Now that the shine has worn off the Liberals\u2019 formula of fake progressivism, we\u2019re being treated to the party\u2019s perennial fall-back: exhortations to back them \u201cstrategically\u201d, lest the Conservatives come to power.

      "bodyText": "How far Justin Trudeau\u2019s star has fallen. In 2015, the rise of this hopey-changey wunderkind was supposed to usher in a bold new Canadian era: democratic reform, ambitious climate action, a plan to tackle inequality, and a new, respectful relationship with Indigenous peoples. But his Liberal party\u2019s bid for re-election, ahead of the election on Monday, looks altogether different: this campaign is dominated by warnings, in ominous tones, about the threat posed by a resurgent, rightwing Conservative party. It\u2019s not hard to understand why. Trudeau\u2019s leftwing posturing has been exposed as a sham. His widely hyped tax hike on the richest 1% was actually a giveaway to the next richest 10% of Canadians. His embrace of a carbon tax became a cover for frenzied approval of fossil fuel projects, culminating in his purchase of a C$4.5bn (US$3.45bn) tar sands pipeline. He dispatched heavily armed police to violently dismantle a peaceful blockade of Indigenous land defenders. He made Canada the second largest weapons dealer to the Middle East, arming the Saudi war on Yemen. And he pressured his own justice minister to exempt a well-connected and corrupt engineering giant from a criminal trial. Beholden to powerful vested interests, Trudeau promised big but delivered small. And so the energy he rode to power has evaporated. Trudeaumania, as one analyst put it, has been replaced by Trudeau-meh-nia. Now that the shine has worn off the Liberals\u2019 formula of fake progressivism, we\u2019re being treated to the party\u2019s perennial fall-back: exhortations to back them \u201cstrategically\u201d, lest the Conservatives come to power. Trudeau\u2019s pledge to \u201cdo politics differently\u201d has devolved into straightforward moral blackmail. Of course, it\u2019s true that a government under Conservative leader Andrew Scheer would be a frightening ordeal: C$35bn (US$26.6bn) in spending cuts, tax giveaways to the wealthiest, climate change denialism, and a potential erosion of abortion and LGBTQ rights. But the Liberals\u2019 invocation of this rightwing threat is hardly in good faith. It\u2019s something they have done time and again to muzzle the political imagination of Canada\u2019s progressive majority of voters. Artificially shoring up the idea that the country is stuck between two parties has one main objective: scaring Canadians into settling for the pipeline-buying establishment Liberals. This fearmongering distracts from just how many economic policies Liberals share with Conservatives \u2013 corporate tax cuts, creeping privatisation, attacks on worker\u2019s rights and relentless resource extraction on Indigenous peoples\u2019 lands. The two parties\u2019 implementation of this free market agenda has resulted in a wildly unequal social order: stagnating wages, unaffordable housing and skyrocketing corporate profits stashed away in offshore tax havens. It\u2019s no wonder that 67% of Canadians, according to a poll last month, believe correctly that the \u201ceconomy is rigged to advantage the rich and powerful\u201d. The Liberals\u2019 inflated rhetoric against the Conservatives also disguises just how comfortable they are swapping power.

Under the leadership of Jagmeet Singh, the NDP has finally halted its right-ward slide \u2013 which allowed Justin Trudeau to outflank it to the left in 2015 \u2013 and is offering its most progressive platform in a generation.

      "body": "<h2><strong>HERE WE GO, HERE WE GO, HERE WE GO, HERE WE GO, THIS IS IT</strong></h2> <p>It is the grandest rivalry in English football. It\u2019s just a pity that Manchester United v Liverpool matches regularly resemble those mid-2000s Birmingham v Bolton clashes that not even Sky Sports Premier League finds airspace to replay. Each of the last three seasons has featured a 0-0 draw in a fixture that gets the loudest fanfare for the most diminished returns. By now, you know the drill for the buildup: a Jimmy Nesbitt voiceover or a local poet delivering Vogon verse atop a soft-focus glimpse of life in the north west\u2019s two great cities, soundtracked by either Pete Wylie or the Stone Roses, depending on which is the home side.<br><br>Could Sunday\u2019s showdown be any different? With Liverpool riding high and Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, the Moyes-faced Assassin, looking increasingly befuddled, the worst is feared at Old Trafford \u2013 a humbling at the hands of the old enemy. United chief suit Ed Woodward has been getting some pre-emptive strikes in before Gary Neville, Graeme Souness and Roy Keane deliver their weekly post-match lecture on what is going wrong for Big Red. \u201cThere is a myth that we have non\u2011football people making football decisions, and it\u2019s insulting to the brilliant people who work on the football side in this club,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/17/manchester-united-recruitment-ed-woodward\">roared Ed</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/18/manchester-united-job-not-too-big-ole-gunnar-solskjaer\">Manchester United job is not too big for me, says Solskj\u00e6r</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The briefing has been broad. Poor, poor David Moyes had zero chance of success, it has been admitted. Daley Blind, yes Daley Blind, that Dutch chap who didn\u2019t cost much and was actually quite decent in midfield, central defence and at left-back, was exactly the wrong player for Manchester United. Lord Ferg\u2019s recruitment process was too reliant on a nod and a wink for any of Ed\u2019s four managers in six years to be able to replicate. But don\u2019t go <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/17/glazers-legacy-manchester-united-liverpool\">blaming the Glazer family</a>, that real-life version of Succession season four, the one set after Logan Roy has breathed his last, who pay Ed an annual stipend north of \u00a34m a year and took out \u00a323m in dividends last year, according to United\u2019s 2018-19 accounts. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is the commercial side is never allowed to take priority over the football side,\u201d said Ed, thumbing the Mr Potato keyring in his pocket.</p> <p>As J\u00fcrgen Klopp toked on his post-training Lucky Strike on Friday, he might have exhaled sympathy for his counterpart. Liverpool spent more than two decades trailing in United\u2019s wake but are barrelling towards the Premier League title. They have Pep Guardiola on the run, let alone Ole\u2019s Scott McTominay-inspired army. And it has been achieved through careful planning, a workable hierarchy and a recognisable style of play, each of which appear well beyond the ken of those running the show at United. Should the worst happen on Sunday, and despite Ed\u2019s protestations and great promises for the future, those sat under Old Trafford\u2019s leaking roof will be letting the directors\u2019 box know exactly who they think is responsible for the mess.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201cI\u2019d go for dinner and a drink but obviously not the after-hours stuff. I was the lame guy who never did anything, haha. People didn\u2019t understand; then, when I started playing for the first team, they began to. Some didn\u2019t even know, then they\u2019d see me play. It\u2019s a personal challenge now more than anything, the time invested. I want the pride of finishing.

      "bodyText": "HERE WE GO, HERE WE GO, HERE WE GO, HERE WE GO, THIS IS IT It is the grandest rivalry in English football. It\u2019s just a pity that Manchester United v Liverpool matches regularly resemble those mid-2000s Birmingham v Bolton clashes that not even Sky Sports Premier League finds airspace to replay. Each of the last three seasons has featured a 0-0 draw in a fixture that gets the loudest fanfare for the most diminished returns. By now, you know the drill for the buildup: a Jimmy Nesbitt voiceover or a local poet delivering Vogon verse atop a soft-focus glimpse of life in the north west\u2019s two great cities, soundtracked by either Pete Wylie or the Stone Roses, depending on which is the home side. Could Sunday\u2019s showdown be any different? With Liverpool riding high and Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, the Moyes-faced Assassin, looking increasingly befuddled, the worst is feared at Old Trafford \u2013 a humbling at the hands of the old enemy. United chief suit Ed Woodward has been getting some pre-emptive strikes in before Gary Neville, Graeme Souness and Roy Keane deliver their weekly post-match lecture on what is going wrong for Big Red. \u201cThere is a myth that we have non\u2011football people making football decisions, and it\u2019s insulting to the brilliant people who work on the football side in this club,\u201d roared Ed. The briefing has been broad. Poor, poor David Moyes had zero chance of success, it has been admitted. Daley Blind, yes Daley Blind, that Dutch chap who didn\u2019t cost much and was actually quite decent in midfield, central defence and at left-back, was exactly the wrong player for Manchester United. Lord Ferg\u2019s recruitment process was too reliant on a nod and a wink for any of Ed\u2019s four managers in six years to be able to replicate. But don\u2019t go blaming the Glazer family, that real-life version of Succession season four, the one set after Logan Roy has breathed his last, who pay Ed an annual stipend north of \u00a34m a year and took out \u00a323m in dividends last year, according to United\u2019s 2018-19 accounts. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is the commercial side is never allowed to take priority over the football side,\u201d said Ed, thumbing the Mr Potato keyring in his pocket. As J\u00fcrgen Klopp toked on his post-training Lucky Strike on Friday, he might have exhaled sympathy for his counterpart. Liverpool spent more than two decades trailing in United\u2019s wake but are barrelling towards the Premier League title. They have Pep Guardiola on the run, let alone Ole\u2019s Scott McTominay-inspired army. And it has been achieved through careful planning, a workable hierarchy and a recognisable style of play, each of which appear well beyond the ken of those running the show at United. Should the worst happen on Sunday, and despite Ed\u2019s protestations and great promises for the future, those sat under Old Trafford\u2019s leaking roof will be letting the directors\u2019 box know exactly who they think is responsible for the mess. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cI\u2019d go for dinner and a drink but obviously not the after-hours stuff. I was the lame guy who never did anything, haha. People didn\u2019t understand; then, when I started playing for the first team, they began to. Some didn\u2019t even know, then they\u2019d see me play. It\u2019s a personal challenge now more than anything, the time invested. I want the pride of finishing. It\u2019s harder because of the distance.

      "body": "<p>Earlier this week, using section 14 of the Public Order Act, the Metropolitan Police <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/14/police-ban-extinction-rebellion-protests-from-whole-of-london\" title=\"\">effectively banned</a> Extinction Rebellion\u2019s autumn uprising protests from the whole of London. It was a bold and unprecedented move, and it provoked predictably strong reactions. For the home secretary, Priti Patel, it was a justified response to an escalating problem. For Labour\u2019s policing minister, Louise Haigh, it was a \u201cgrotesque overreaction and extremely worrying attack on basic civil liberties\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>If protesters feel they are under ever greater restrictions, then the police undoubtedly feel they cannot win</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Short-term policing victories can come at enormous cost. Sir Robert Mark, commissioner of the Met in the 1970s, was fond of pointing out that the secret of policing protests was \u201cwinning by appearing to lose\u201d. The danger of something like the London ban is that it can easily become losing by appearing to win.</p> \n<p>Such a lesson is not confined to the police. Undeterred by the ban and the mounting numbers of arrests \u2013 more than 1,600 at the last count \u2013 Extinction Rebellion has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/15/to-do-nothing-is-criminal-xr-extinction-rebellion-activists-defying-police\" title=\"\">continued its protests</a>. Until now it has generally been fairly careful about both its tactics and its targets. The decision by some of its supporters to disrupt the public transport system, targeting ordinary commuters in east London, seemed ill-judged, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/17/london-tube-protest-divides-extinction-rebellion\" title=\"\">largely backfired</a> in the court of public opinion.</p> \n<p>We have a long and proud <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/13/climate-protests-roots-deep-rich-history-british-social-change\" title=\"\">history of protest</a> in this country, from bread rioters and machine breakers to Chartists and suffragettes, from the Jarrow marchers to the Greenham Common peace camp. Their causes were all controversial at the time \u2013 and often their tactics were too. Protest is usually by its nature disruptive; it is designed to be so, in order that the message is heard. Consequently, the right to protest is a contingent one. There are other freedoms against which it must be balanced, not least the rights of others to go about their daily lives safely and relatively unhindered.</p> \n<p>In the middle of this balancing act stand the police. They have duties both to facilitate protest and to maintain order. Getting the balance right is never straightforward. Criticism of policing comes with the territory, and the section 14 ban is no exception.</p> \n<p>There has been no shortage of controversial new policing operations in recent times. Among the most contentious has been kettling \u2013 the containment of crowds within a cordon for extended periods of time \u2013 which led to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/dec/26/metropolitan-police-lawsuit-student-protest\" title=\"\">legal action</a> and, eventually, all the way to the European court of human rights. The policing of the climate camp and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/01/g20-summit-protests\" title=\"\">G20 protests</a> in London in 2009 were strongly criticised by the home affairs select committee, among others, as overzealous in their use of force and likely to undermine public trust in policing.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"75eff9c4-2c76-46bd-a2ae-8db9dbbb6651\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FA51eTAu94o?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>From the student demos in 2010, and alleged over-policing of the <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/olympics/olympic-news/london-2012-olympics-met-defends-policing-of-cycle-protest-which-led-to-hundreds-of-arrests-7985830.html\" title=\"\">Critical Mass activities</a> during the 2012 Olympics, through to the treatment of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/10/uk-police-let-four-deadlines-slip-on-anti-fracking-protest-review-emails-show\" title=\"\">anti-fracking protesters</a> more recently, the criticisms of policing are varied and widespread.</p> \n<p>Some view this week\u2019s Extinction Rebellion ban as part of a longer-term erosion of the right to protest, and a drift toward more restrictive and interventionist policing. There have been worries expressed about the growing use of proactive and intrusive surveillance, including the use of new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jun/14/police-face-legal-action-over-use-of-facial-recognition-cameras\" title=\"\">facial recognition technology</a>. Allegations of the police\u2019s use of undercover agents provocateurs are long-standing, but have been given new impetus from the Guardian\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ng-interactive/2018/oct/15/uk-political-groups-spied-on-undercover-police-list\" title=\"\">recent investigations</a>, and are now the subject of an official inquiry. Meanwhile, concerns have been raised over the use of anti-terror laws to deal with peaceful protest, as in the case of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/feb/06/stansted-15-rights-campaigners-urge-judge-to-show-leniency\" title=\"\">Stansted 15 anti-deportation protesters</a>.</p> \n<p>If protesters feel they are under ever greater restrictions, then the police undoubtedly feel they cannot win in all this. Criticism of heavy-handedness is never far away. Equally, we only need go back to the 2011 riots to find the police under severe criticism from political leaders and others for their failure to respond sufficiently robustly. All this must bring us back to the principles of policing protest.</p> \n<p>According to the College of Policing, the service\u2019s own professional body, policing strategies should minimise recourse to the use of force, and \u201cpolicing by consent\u201d should underpin operations. The definition of policing by consent is often in the eye of the beholder, but many look to Sir Robert Peel\u2019s original formulation: to \u201crecognise always that the power of the police to fulfil their functions and duties is dependent on public approval of their existence, actions and behaviour and on their ability to secure and maintain public respect\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/17/extinction-rebellion-canning-town-well-off-people\">Extinction Rebellion has built up so much goodwill. It mustn\u2019t throw that away | Gaby Hinsliff</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>There can be little doubt that the Extinction Rebellion protests have been overwhelmingly peaceful. In both its April protests and in the early days of the \u201cautumn uprising\u201d much of the policing was low-key and facilitative, only giving way later to large numbers of arrests and the clearance of some sites.</p> \n<p>What sets this week apart, and raises questions of proportionality, is the sudden, quite radical decision to amend section 14 and impose a temporary city-wide ban. The high court has granted Extinction Rebellion permission to challenge the ban, and a judicial review, now under way, will rule on this \u2013 most likely at the start of next week. Whatever its decision, the public reception to the Met\u2019s action is of potentially great consequence. A long-established lesson of British public order policing is that maintaining public trust and confidence is vital.</p> \n<p>It is a reminder that winning hearts and minds is crucial both in protest and the policing of protest. To forget this is perilous for both.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Tim Newburn is professor of criminology and social policy at the London School of Economics</p>",

For Labour\u2019s policing minister, Louise Haigh, it was a \u201cgrotesque overreaction and extremely worrying attack on basic civil liberties\u201d. Short-term policing victories can come at enormous cost. Sir Robert Mark, commissioner of the Met in the 1970s, was fond of pointing out that the secret of policing protests was \u201cwinning by appearing to lose\u201d. The danger of something like the London ban is that it can easily become losing by appearing to win. Such a lesson is not confined to the police. Undeterred by the ban and the mounting numbers of arrests \u2013 more than 1,600 at the last count \u2013 Extinction Rebellion has continued its protests. Until now it has generally been fairly careful about both its tactics and its targets. The decision by some of its supporters to disrupt the public transport system, targeting ordinary commuters in east London, seemed ill-judged, and largely backfired in the court of public opinion. We have a long and proud history of protest in this country, from bread rioters and machine breakers to Chartists and suffragettes, from the Jarrow marchers to the Greenham Common peace camp. Their causes were all controversial at the time \u2013 and often their tactics were too. Protest is usually by its nature disruptive; it is designed to be so, in order that the message is heard. Consequently, the right to protest is a contingent one. There are other freedoms against which it must be balanced, not least the rights of others to go about their daily lives safely and relatively unhindered. In the middle of this balancing act stand the police. They have duties both to facilitate protest and to maintain order. Getting the balance right is never straightforward. Criticism of policing comes with the territory, and the section 14 ban is no exception. There has been no shortage of controversial new policing operations in recent times. Among the most contentious has been kettling \u2013 the containment of crowds within a cordon for extended periods of time \u2013 which led to legal action and, eventually, all the way to the European court of human rights. The policing of the climate camp and G20 protests in London in 2009 were strongly criticised by the home affairs select committee, among others, as overzealous in their use of force and likely to undermine public trust in policing. From the student demos in 2010, and alleged over-policing of the Critical Mass activities during the 2012 Olympics, through to the treatment of anti-fracking protesters more recently, the criticisms of policing are varied and widespread. Some view this week\u2019s Extinction Rebellion ban as part of a longer-term erosion of the right to protest, and a drift toward more restrictive and interventionist policing. There have been worries expressed about the growing use of proactive and intrusive surveillance, including the use of new facial recognition technology. Allegations of the police\u2019s use of undercover agents provocateurs are long-standing, but have been given new impetus from the Guardian\u2019s recent investigations, and are now the subject of an official inquiry. Meanwhile, concerns have been raised over the use of anti-terror laws to deal with peaceful protest, as in the case of the Stansted 15 anti-deportation protesters. If protesters feel they are under ever greater restrictions, then the police undoubtedly feel they cannot win in all this. Criticism of heavy-handedness is never far away. Equally, we only need go back to the 2011 riots to find the police under severe criticism from political leaders and others for their failure to respond sufficiently robustly. All this must bring us back to the principles of policing protest. According to the College of Policing, the service\u2019s own professional body, policing strategies should minimise recourse to the use of force, and \u201cpolicing by consent\u201d should underpin operations. The definition of policing by consent is often in the eye of the beholder, but many look to Sir Robert Peel\u2019s original formulation: to \u201crecognise always that the power of the police to fulfil their functions and duties is dependent on public approval of their existence, actions and behaviour and on their ability to secure and maintain public respect\u201d. There can be little doubt that the Extinction Rebellion protests have been overwhelmingly peaceful. In both its April protests and in the early days of the \u201cautumn uprising\u201d much of the policing was low-key and facilitative, only giving way later to large numbers of arrests and the clearance of some sites. What sets this week apart, and raises questions of proportionality, is the sudden, quite radical decision to amend section 14 and impose a temporary city-wide ban. The high court has granted Extinction Rebellion permission to challenge the ban, and a judicial review, now under way, will rule on this \u2013 most likely at the start of next week. Whatever its decision, the public reception to the Met\u2019s action is of potentially great consequence. A long-established lesson of British public order policing is that maintaining public trust and confidence is vital. It is a reminder that winning hearts and minds is crucial both in protest and the policing of protest. To forget this is perilous for both. \u2022 Tim Newburn is professor of criminology and social policy at the London School of Economics",

On 13 October, Kurdish leaders agreed to allow Syrian regime forces to enter some cities to protect them from being captured by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey\">Turkey</a>&nbsp;and its allies.

With US support, including arms and airstrikes, the Kurds managed to beat back Isis and went on to win a string of victories against the radical militant group. Along the way the fighters absorbed non-Kurdish groups, changed their name to the SDF and grew to include 60,000 soldiers.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why does Turkey oppose the Kurds?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>For years, Turkey has watched the growing ties between the US and SDF with alarm. Significant numbers of the Kurds in the SDF were also members of the People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG), an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK) that has fought an insurgency against the Turkish state for more than 35 years in which as many as 40,000 people have died. The PKK initially called for independence and now demands greater autonomy for Kurds inside&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey\">Turkey</a>.</p>\n    <p>Turkey claims the PKK has continued to wage war on the Turkish state, even as it has assisted in the fight against Isis. The PKK is listed as a terrorist group by Turkey, the US, the UK, Nato and others and this has proved awkward for the US and its allies, who have chosen to downplay the SDF\u2019s links to the PKK, preferring to focus on their shared objective of defeating Isis.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are Turkey\u2019s objectives on its southern border?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Turkey aims firstly to push the SDF away from its border, creating a 20-mile (32km) buffer zone that would have been jointly patrolled by Turkish and US troops until Trump\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/07/us-withdrawal-from-syria-leaves-fate-of-isis-fighters-and-families-in-detention-uncertain\">recent announcement</a>&nbsp;that American soldiers would withdraw from the region.</p>\n    <p>Erdo\u011fan has also said he would seek to relocate more than 1 million Syrian refugees in this \u201csafe zone\u201d, both removing them from his country (where their presence has started to create a backlash) and complicating the demographic mix in what he fears could become an autonomous Kurdish state on his border.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How would a Turkish incursion impact on Isis?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Nearly 11,000 Isis fighters, including almost 2,000 foreigners, and tens of thousands of their wives and children, are being held in detention camps and hastily fortified prisons across north-eastern Syria.</p>\n    <p>SDF leaders have warned they cannot guarantee the security of these prisoners if they are forced to redeploy their forces to the frontlines of a war against Turkey. They also fear Isis could use the chaos of war to mount attacks to free their fighters or reclaim territory.<br></p>\n    <p>On 11 October, it was reported that at least five detained Isis fighters had escaped a prison in the region. Two days later, 750 foreign women affiliated to Isis and their children managed to break out of a secure annex in the Ain Issa camp for displaced people, according to SDF officials.</p>\n    <p>It is unclear which detention sites the SDF still controls and the status of the prisoners inside.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michael-safi\"><b>Michael Safi</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The Syrian regime and its Russian allies, who have also moved troops into the contested border zone at the invitation of the SDF, and are not bound by the terms of the US-Turkish agreement, had no immediate comment.</p> \n<p>Erdo\u011fan told reporters in Istanbul on Friday he had confirmation that Kurdish fighters were withdrawing, dismissing reports of the ongoing clashes as \u201cspeculation, disinformation\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Fighting was continuing on the border between Syria and Turkey on Friday in defiance of a supposed five-day ceasefire negotiated between the US and Turkey, amid allegations of war crimes. Intermittent artillery fire and ground clashes were heard in the border town of Ras al-Ayn on Friday morning, one of the two main targets of the nine-day-old Turkish offensive, as the Turkish military and Syrian rebel proxies struggled to wrest control of the town from the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). Kurdish officials said the hospital at Ras al-Ayn had been shelled, and it was impossible to evacuate the wounded because the town was surrounded. A statement by the SDF\u2019s political wing, the Syrian Democratic Council, said Turkey and its proxies had ignored the ceasefire, and it appealed for international monitors to be placed in the region. Amnesty International said it had compiled \u201cdamning evidence\u201d of crimes committed by Turkish forces and Syrian militias backed by Ankara. Amnesty claimed they displayed \u201ca shameful disregard for civilian life, including through summary killings and unlawful attacks that have killed and injured civilians\u201d. At the same time, UN chemical weapons inspectors launched an investigation following accusations that burning white phosphorus was used by Turkish forces against children in Syria earlier this week. The fighting showed no signs of abating a day after a US delegation led by the vice-president, Mike Pence, announced they had agreed a ceasefire with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, in Ankara \u2013 a deal the US president, Donald Trump, claimed was \u201ca great day for civilisation\u201d that would save \u201cmillions of lives\u201d. On Friday, Trump played down the violations, saying he had received personal reassurance from Erdo\u011fan, and that the \u201cultimate solution\u201d, supposedly of a peace deal, would be achieved. \u201cHe told me there was minor sniper and mortar fire that was quickly eliminated,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cHe very much wants the ceasefire, or pause, to work. Likewise, the Kurds want it, and the ultimate solution, to happen.\u201d The US president then retweeted a statement from Erdo\u011fan casting the invasion as a counter-terrorism operation. Later in the day, at a teleconference to talk to two American astronauts, Trump made the unexplained claim that \u201cwe\u2019ve taken control of the oil in the Middle East \u2026 the oil that everybody was worried about\u201d. It appeared likely that he was referring to oilfields in eastern Syria, that are under SDF control. In the US, the deal reached in Ankara on Thursday has been strongly criticised by both Democrats and Republicans as a gift to Erdo\u011fan, granting legitimacy to the offensive and suspending sanctions, but requiring no Turkish concessions in return. The ceasefire was supposed to last for 120 hours but it was unclear from the start whether the SDF had agreed to the terms laid out in Ankara. However, while the SDF commander, Mazloum Kobane, acknowledged the ceasefire, he said his fighters were ready to abide by it only in the border strip between Ras al-Ayn and Tel Abyad, the other town under Turkish attack. The Syrian regime and its Russian allies, who have also moved troops into the contested border zone at the invitation of the SDF, and are not bound by the terms of the US-Turkish agreement, had no immediate comment. Erdo\u011fan told reporters in Istanbul on Friday he had confirmation that Kurdish fighters were withdrawing, dismissing reports of the ongoing clashes as \u201cspeculation, disinformation\u201d.

Macron added that he expected to meet Erdo\u011fan alongside Boris Johnson and Angela Merkel in London in the coming weeks. Turkey launched Operation Peace Spring, aimed at driving the SDF away from its border, on 9 October. The assault was triggered by Trump\u2019s announcement that US troops would withdraw from the region, which removed the buffer that had stopped Turkey attacking the Kurdish-led force. On Thursday it emerged that Trump had sent his Turkish counterpart a bizarre letter warning him \u201cdon\u2019t be a fool\u201d and saying history risked branding him a \u201cdevil\u201d . Erdo\u011fan responded on Friday by saying his country \u201ccannot forget\u201d the letter but that the mutual \u201clove and respect\u201d between the two leaders prevented him from keeping it on Turkey\u2019s agenda. Ankara maintains the SDF is indistinguishable from Turkey\u2019s outlawed militant Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK) and has long been angered by US support for the group during the five-year-long campaign to defeat Islamic State. The offensive has been widely condemned for triggering a humanitarian crisis and risking the re-emergence of Isis amid the chaos. At least 300,000 people have fled their homes in the fighting and at least 71 people have been killed in north-east Syria, according to the UN and a human rights monitor. Over the border in Turkey, 20 civilians have been killed in counterattacks. A statement released by Washington and Ankara after the ceasefire talks did not define any changes to the size and scope of Turkey\u2019s proposed safe zone, which Turkish officials have previously said should be 20 miles deep and stretch 270 miles from the contested town of Manbij to the Iraqi border. The statement also reiterated the US understanding of Turkey\u2019s need for a safe zone, which would be \u201cprimarily enforced by the Turkish armed forces\u201d after the Kurdish withdrawal, implying that Ankara still intends to occupy the entire area. Erdo\u011fan is due to meet his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, in Sochi on Tuesday, where it is expected further concrete talks on the size of Turkey\u2019s planned buffer zone will take place.",

This is clearly not happening, putting children at risk from what can be a deadly disease.\u201d The girl\u2019s mother added: \u201cFlu is scary if your child has asthma.\u201d On Thursday 4 October, Home Farm primary school in Colchester, Essex, had to cancel plans to immunise pupils the following Monday. In an email to parents, the headteacher said it was because of a national shortage of the vaccine. It will now issue the nasal spray on 5 and 8 November. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, said the delay was \u201cconcerning\u201d and could damage trust in the vaccination programme. \u201cWe have been made aware of a delay to some of the nasal vaccines that are given to children, but we have been assured that this delay will be short and that GP practices will still receive their vaccinations early enough in the season for patients to receive full benefit from them,\u201d she said. \u201cWe would urge parents of children not to be deterred from making arrangements for their child to get their vaccinations. But it might be worth checking that the vaccinations have definitely arrived when you book your appointment.\u201d AstraZeneca sought to reassure parents that sufficient quantities of the vaccine would eventually be available, so no child would miss out. It said: \u201cDue to the delay in strain recommendation and subsequent manufacture of new strains for the 2019-20 season, deliveries of the vaccine will be spread across the season, as opposed to being concentrated in the initial months of the season. \u201cAstraZeneca is manufacturing and delivering the full quantity of vaccine required for the UK childhood influenza vaccination programme.\u201d Public Health England said it had advised GP surgeries not to schedule sessions at which the nasal spray would be administered until mid-October. Dr Mary Ramsay, PHE\u2019s head of immunisation, said: \u201cGPs have ordered supplies for adults from manufacturers in the usual way and batches of the vaccines for schools are being delivered, too. Timings for the delivery of flu vaccine are always subject to change because of the nature of the manufacturing and regulatory release processes. \u201cThe delay in WHO announcing the strain means that we have received vaccines for children slightly later than usual and so we have been prioritising schools as they are already planning their vaccination sessions.\u201d GPs would be able to start ordering supplies shortly, she added. Problems have also limited the supply of the version of the flu vaccine given to 16- to 65-year-olds.",

Here\u2019s where to slake it. If one place encapsulates Ireland\u2019s food revolution, it is Galway: a boho college city I can only describe as an international crossroads that walks and talks like a country town. Now is a great time to go as the city gears up to enjoy its moment on the world stage as European capital of culture.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s so much diversity here,\u201d says Sheena Dignam of <a href=\"https://galwayfoodtours.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Galway Food Tours</a>. \u201cIt goes from old institutions like Griffin\u2019s bakery, trading for six generations, to new coffee roasters such as Calendar and breweries such as Soulwater.

Thirty-one of JMW Turner\u2019s works were bequeathed to the gallery in 1900 \u2013 on the condition that they be exhibited for free, every year, for the full month of January.

It\u2019s the show that launched a thousand one-liners \u2026 and an excuse to look again at the cool, historic and complicated city in which it is set. Visit today, and you\u2019ll find a guided Derry Girls tour, a mural of the gang on Orchard Street, and locals eager to show that there\u2019s much more to their home than stereotypes. \u201cI\u2019d describe it as a spring uncoiling,\u201d says James Huey, owner of the Walled City Brewery. \u201cFor 30 years, our food scene was on pause \u2013 it\u2019s almost like we\u2019re accelerating to fill this void that happened.\u201d His small-batch beers hint at the city\u2019s spirit, too. One sour brew is called Beerexit (\u201cit splits people down the middle, pretty much\u201d). Another, an imperial stout, is called Sister Michael. The Derry Girls mural, a view of the city and Walled City Brewery The city is in a hurry. The Bishop\u2019s Gate and Shipquay hotels are tidy new townhouse options within the 400-year old walls. A pedestrian Peace Bridge straddles the River Foyle; a new Museum of Free Derry tells the story of the city\u2019s civil rights movement among the political murals of the Bogside. Tens of thousands of people dress up for its annual Halloween carnival, and all of this right at the crossroads where the Causeway Coast meets the Wild Atlantic Way. Best of all, perhaps, is the value. A walking tour costs \u00a34. A two-course lunch special at chef Ian Orr\u2019s Browns in Town will set you back all of \u00a312. Go on. Be an individual \u2026 your ma won\u2019t mind. Get there: Fly to City of Derry airport. The city is a 90-minute drive from Belfast, or roughly 3.5 hours from Dublin. visitderry.com Gastro Galway Got an appetite? Here\u2019s where to slake it. If one place encapsulates Ireland\u2019s food revolution, it is Galway: a boho college city I can only describe as an international crossroads that walks and talks like a country town. Now is a great time to go as the city gears up to enjoy its moment on the world stage as European capital of culture. \u201cThere\u2019s so much diversity here,\u201d says Sheena Dignam of Galway Food Tours. \u201cIt goes from old institutions like Griffin\u2019s bakery, trading for six generations, to new coffee roasters such as Calendar and breweries such as Soulwater. Galway makes me feel at home. It\u2019s just one of those places that has this impalpable energy.\u201d A dish at Aniar, the restaurant\u2019s chef patron JP McMahon, and Dela Impalpable is a good word. Here\u2019s a city that feels authentically artsy rather than artificially hip. It\u2019s got two Michelin-star restaurants (Aniar and Loam), and a Food on the Edge symposium that brings superstar chefs such as Virgilio Mart\u00ednez and Angela Hartnett to the Wild Atlantic Way. But it\u2019s also crammed with great casual eats such as Kai, Dela or Ard Bia at Nimmos, and reverence is equally bestowed on local fixtures such as McCambridge\u2019s deli, or the sizzle of Herterich\u2019s sausages. \u201cIt\u2019s a small, tight little area with so much variety and an astonishing welcome,\u201d says Brian Nolan of Galway City Walking Tours. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to walk more than 500 yards [and you\u2019ve gone in time] from St Nicholas\u2019s church all the way through to the European capital of culture 2020. Yesterday, I passed two musicians from Finland playing outside T\u00edg C\u00f3il\u00ed. It\u2019s not packaged. It\u2019s happening organically.\u201d Tuck in. Walk the Latin Quarter, visit the Druid theatre, browse Charlie Byrne\u2019s Bookshop, and angle for a pew outside the T\u00edg C\u00f3il\u00ed pub. You\u2019ll feel like a Galwegian before you know it. Get there: Galway is a 2.5-hour drive from Dublin, and an hour from Shannon (both widely served from the UK). wildatlanticway.com Dublin: winter is coming Dublin really comes into its own in winter. On a crisp blue-skied afternoon, nothing beats a chilly stroll in Phoenix Park followed by a hot whiskey in a cosy pub such as L Mulligan Grocer or the Legal Eagle. Or an amble from IMMA (Irish Museum of Modern Art) to one of the city\u2019s new wave of distilleries \u2013 Teeling, Roe &amp; Co or Pearse Lyons. Streets in Temple Bar, the Legal Eagle and Teeling Brewery \u201cWinter is probably my favourite time of year in Dublin, not least because museum people are born to wear autumn and winter clothes!\u201d says Simon O\u2019Connor, director of the new Museum of Literature Ireland (MoLI) on St Stephen\u2019s Green. \u201cIt\u2019s as if the Georgian and Victorian colours of the city are at their best in the beautiful winter light we get here \u2013 and it\u2019s often our driest season, too. Crisp air and the whiff of wood fires only amplify an evening stroll to Dublin\u2019s great bars, with their windows fogged up and the hum of contentment from within.\u201d As the daylight hours recede, the festival colour picks up. Halloween\u2019s Bram Stoker festival celebrates the author of Dracula. NYF Dublin is a three-day series of new year\u2019s celebrations. Before you know it, January is here, Tradfest is thumping in Temple Bar, and Turner\u2019s watercolours are on display at the National Gallery. For me, that\u2019s a wow moment. Thirty-one of JMW Turner\u2019s works were bequeathed to the gallery in 1900 \u2013 on the condition that they be exhibited for free, every year, for the full month of January. They\u2019re a soft light in seasonal darkness.

      "body": "<p><strong>Two years ago, I started a relationship with a wonderful older man, but from the beginning something seemed a little off. After we celebrated our first anniversary, I had the shameful impulse to ask to see his phone. He agreed</strong><strong>. There I saw what was bothering me: a previous girlfriend had been texting him every day, and he had been </strong><strong>replying: photos, kiss emoticons, five-minute-long voice messages. It had been going on every </strong><strong>day for the year we had been together.</strong></p> <p><strong>They apparently had an intense, somewhat problematic, two-year relationship, but she moved abroad. He says they were going to break up anyway. I felt they were being disrespectful towards me and towards themselves, putting all this energy into something that had theoretically ended and not allowing new relationships to fully blossom. </strong><strong>He said they texted because they remained good friends, that\u2019s all. That is hard for me to believe. He said he was not aware this could be so damaging to me</strong><strong>. He told me he had stopped messaging her so often and that, for him, it made no difference.</strong></p> <p><strong>A year has passed and everything is great. However, I still have moments of doubt. He travels a lot and </strong><strong>works in the same field as </strong><strong>h</strong><strong>is ex, sometimes travelling to the same places. I can\u2019t help but imagine emotionally charged encounters, if not more. Does my insecurity have some sort of foundation, or I am </strong><strong>making a bit too much of this?</strong></p> <p>I wonder what made you ask to see his phone after a year? And I wonder what made you write now?</p> <p>I think we can become insecure when we know something\u2019s not right, and that some people make us feel more insecure than others. We tend to lack confidence in situations, or people, when we feel information is being withheld and we don\u2019t know the full story \u2013 so we fill in the gaps with our own imagination.</p> <p>I would have liked to know a bit more about your past relationships and if you\u2019ve always been like this. If so, then it\u2019s worth looking at why relationships make you feel insecure. Or maybe this is your first serious relationship and you don\u2019t have exes, so you can\u2019t understand why people stay in touch with theirs. When I found out my first boyfriend still occasionally saw his ex, I couldn\u2019t understand why, either. But people stay in touch with exes for all sorts of reasons, some of them benign and some not so much. Some people like to have their exes on the back-burner to bolster their ego. I\u2019ve known men like that.</p> <p>Five-minute-long voice messages and texts every day is quite a commitment, however: does he lavish the same attention on all his friends? What\u2019s the context? I\u2019m also intrigued that he\u2019s older, has experience of relationships, but doesn\u2019t seem to think that being in touch with his ex might bother you. Plus, so much texting yet it \u201cmade no difference to him\u201d? Then why do it? I think he\u2019s being disingenuous.</p> <p>Gavin de Becker writes (brilliant, fascinating) books about how we ignore our intuition, often to our detriment. It has made me realise the power of intuition, which social conditioning has largely taught us to ignore for fear of seeming silly or paranoid. We don\u2019t feel we can trust our instincts, so often look for proof instead \u2013 as you did with your boyfriend\u2019s phone.</p> <p>In De Becker\u2019s book <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gift_of_Fear\" title=\"\">The Gift Of Fear</a>, he writes about giving a talk and asking how many people in the audience had children. Then he asked: \u201cHow many of you have left your children with a babysitter?\u201d And finally he asked: \u201cHow many of you aren\u2019t absolutely sure about your babysitter?\u201d A few hands went up. So he said: \u201cWhat are you doing here? Go home.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/sep/06/should-i-tell-my-sister-her-father-might-not-be-her-father\">Should I tell my sister her father might not be her father?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This isn\u2019t really about who your boyfriend is in contact with or not; it\u2019s about the fact that you feel something isn\u2019t quite right.

      "bodyText": "Two years ago, I started a relationship with a wonderful older man, but from the beginning something seemed a little off. After we celebrated our first anniversary, I had the shameful impulse to ask to see his phone. He agreed. There I saw what was bothering me: a previous girlfriend had been texting him every day, and he had been replying: photos, kiss emoticons, five-minute-long voice messages. It had been going on every day for the year we had been together. They apparently had an intense, somewhat problematic, two-year relationship, but she moved abroad. He says they were going to break up anyway. I felt they were being disrespectful towards me and towards themselves, putting all this energy into something that had theoretically ended and not allowing new relationships to fully blossom. He said they texted because they remained good friends, that\u2019s all. That is hard for me to believe. He said he was not aware this could be so damaging to me. He told me he had stopped messaging her so often and that, for him, it made no difference. A year has passed and everything is great. However, I still have moments of doubt. He travels a lot and works in the same field as his ex, sometimes travelling to the same places. I can\u2019t help but imagine emotionally charged encounters, if not more. Does my insecurity have some sort of foundation, or I am making a bit too much of this? I wonder what made you ask to see his phone after a year? And I wonder what made you write now? I think we can become insecure when we know something\u2019s not right, and that some people make us feel more insecure than others. We tend to lack confidence in situations, or people, when we feel information is being withheld and we don\u2019t know the full story \u2013 so we fill in the gaps with our own imagination. I would have liked to know a bit more about your past relationships and if you\u2019ve always been like this. If so, then it\u2019s worth looking at why relationships make you feel insecure. Or maybe this is your first serious relationship and you don\u2019t have exes, so you can\u2019t understand why people stay in touch with theirs. When I found out my first boyfriend still occasionally saw his ex, I couldn\u2019t understand why, either. But people stay in touch with exes for all sorts of reasons, some of them benign and some not so much. Some people like to have their exes on the back-burner to bolster their ego. I\u2019ve known men like that. Five-minute-long voice messages and texts every day is quite a commitment, however: does he lavish the same attention on all his friends? What\u2019s the context? I\u2019m also intrigued that he\u2019s older, has experience of relationships, but doesn\u2019t seem to think that being in touch with his ex might bother you. Plus, so much texting yet it \u201cmade no difference to him\u201d? Then why do it? I think he\u2019s being disingenuous. Gavin de Becker writes (brilliant, fascinating) books about how we ignore our intuition, often to our detriment. It has made me realise the power of intuition, which social conditioning has largely taught us to ignore for fear of seeming silly or paranoid. We don\u2019t feel we can trust our instincts, so often look for proof instead \u2013 as you did with your boyfriend\u2019s phone. In De Becker\u2019s book The Gift Of Fear, he writes about giving a talk and asking how many people in the audience had children. Then he asked: \u201cHow many of you have left your children with a babysitter?\u201d And finally he asked: \u201cHow many of you aren\u2019t absolutely sure about your babysitter?\u201d A few hands went up. So he said: \u201cWhat are you doing here? Go home.\u201d This isn\u2019t really about who your boyfriend is in contact with or not; it\u2019s about the fact that you feel something isn\u2019t quite right. Pay attention to that feeling and explore it. There may be nothing going on, or you may just feel doubtful about him and have pegged all those doubts on to this one thing. For this relationship to have a future, you need to be able to trust him with your fears and know he will try to understand them; he should not only respect them, he should assuage them. A relationship where you doubt both him and yourself will eventually exhaust you. \u2022 Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.com.

On one hand, the baby boomers\u2019 ruination of the planet (and the property market) was well under way before I\u2019d even learned to ride a bike. On the other, not being a millennial or Z-er, at least I learned to ride a bike, rather than spending my childhood in a darkened room staring at a screen in preparation for a career writing articles explaining to my elders why the films they liked as teenagers were actually <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/elliewoodward/problematic-movie-moments\" title=\"\">horribly problematic</a>. In short, I have examined the evidence for the merits of each generation, and reached the dispassionate conclusion that mine is best.</p> <p>Perhaps you\u2019ll object that this is a load of nonsense; my defence is that almost everything we think we know about the generations is nonsense. Partly, that\u2019s just because there\u2019s too much <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20171115-millenials-are-the-most-narcissistic-generation-not-so-fast\" title=\"\">variation within generations</a> to generalise very much, and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/04/01/your-generational-identity-is-a-lie/\" title=\"\">the lines we draw</a> between them are arbitrary. But it\u2019s also because it\u2019s all but impossible to pick apart what\u2019s attributable to membership of a given generation, versus being a given age. For example, a phenomenon known as <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/cusp/201210/the-reminiscence-bump\" title=\"\">the \u201creminiscence bump\u201d</a> means older people retain more vivid memories of their youth than their middle years, and those memories <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1364661305002378\" title=\"\">are more likely</a> to be positive, too. So as you age, and other memories fade, you\u2019re more likely to conclude that life today, and young people, are much worse than in the past.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/sep/13/why-playtime-for-adults-wont-bring-your-childhood-back\">Why playtime for adults won\u2019t bring your childhood back | Oliver Burkeman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then again, <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolicy.com/2019/06/26/the_boomers_ruined_everything_42127.html\" title=\"\">\u201cthe boomers ruined everything\u201d</a> argument, beloved of millennials, isn\u2019t much less suspect. There\u2019s plenty wrong with the world today and, well, <em>of course </em>that\u2019s the fault of an earlier generation. But the true test of boomer awfulness will come in 50 years, when we see if the generation levelling the charge screwed things up any less.</p> <p>The most blatant instances of this confusion are the insults hurled at millennials and Generation Z: mainly that they\u2019re a) narcissistic and b) irritatingly entitled and uncommitted in their attitudes to their jobs. There\u2019s a case to be made that these claims are false, yet as the psychologist David Costanza explains, even if they\u2019re true, they\u2019re probably age-related. Younger people have always tended to be more narcissistic. And we use the first part of our careers to try things out, so it\u2019s hardly surprising that the older you get, the more likely you are to be satisfied with your job.</p> <p>So we should be honest with ourselves. Even when there\u2019s merit in our judgments of others, there\u2019s such a large dollop of bias \u2013 motivated by a need to feel superior, or to find someone to blame \u2013 that we can\u2019t trust any conclusions we reach.

      "bodyText": "As a member of Generation X, I naturally derive much of my self-esteem from reflecting on the fact that I\u2019m neither older nor younger than I am. On one hand, the baby boomers\u2019 ruination of the planet (and the property market) was well under way before I\u2019d even learned to ride a bike. On the other, not being a millennial or Z-er, at least I learned to ride a bike, rather than spending my childhood in a darkened room staring at a screen in preparation for a career writing articles explaining to my elders why the films they liked as teenagers were actually horribly problematic. In short, I have examined the evidence for the merits of each generation, and reached the dispassionate conclusion that mine is best. Perhaps you\u2019ll object that this is a load of nonsense; my defence is that almost everything we think we know about the generations is nonsense. Partly, that\u2019s just because there\u2019s too much variation within generations to generalise very much, and the lines we draw between them are arbitrary. But it\u2019s also because it\u2019s all but impossible to pick apart what\u2019s attributable to membership of a given generation, versus being a given age. For example, a phenomenon known as the \u201creminiscence bump\u201d means older people retain more vivid memories of their youth than their middle years, and those memories are more likely to be positive, too. So as you age, and other memories fade, you\u2019re more likely to conclude that life today, and young people, are much worse than in the past. Then again, \u201cthe boomers ruined everything\u201d argument, beloved of millennials, isn\u2019t much less suspect. There\u2019s plenty wrong with the world today and, well, of course that\u2019s the fault of an earlier generation. But the true test of boomer awfulness will come in 50 years, when we see if the generation levelling the charge screwed things up any less. The most blatant instances of this confusion are the insults hurled at millennials and Generation Z: mainly that they\u2019re a) narcissistic and b) irritatingly entitled and uncommitted in their attitudes to their jobs. There\u2019s a case to be made that these claims are false, yet as the psychologist David Costanza explains, even if they\u2019re true, they\u2019re probably age-related. Younger people have always tended to be more narcissistic. And we use the first part of our careers to try things out, so it\u2019s hardly surprising that the older you get, the more likely you are to be satisfied with your job. So we should be honest with ourselves. Even when there\u2019s merit in our judgments of others, there\u2019s such a large dollop of bias \u2013 motivated by a need to feel superior, or to find someone to blame \u2013 that we can\u2019t trust any conclusions we reach. In my case, I assume it\u2019s a form of mid-life crisis: I\u2019m trying to distance myself from death, by defining myself against an older cohort; at the same time, I\u2019m bolstering myself against the threat of professional replacement by people with more energy, and life ahead of them, than I have. Which is a pity. If the world is going to hell in a handbasket, we\u2019re all in the same handbasket; it might not be the best use of our time to be debating who has the best seat.

Capital accumulation (that is infrastructure or machinery) faces decreasing marginal returns: the first highways and railways generated more economic growth than current projects. </p> <p>Finally, improvements in productivity through innovation is much harder and slower than through imitation. China has reached a middle-income status and most countries face slowing GDP growth at this point.</p> <p>In sum, it is natural to expect China\u2019s economy to grow at a slower rate in the coming years \u2013 even in the absence of a trade dispute with the United States.

      "bodyText": "Chinese GDP figures set a negative tone for markets today, sparking fresh worries about how the slowdown might reverberate across the global economy. But Brexit was still on the minds of currency traders, as comments from Bank of England deputy governor David Ramsden suggesting a rate rise would still be on the cards in a smooth Brexit scenario, propped up the pound (at least temporarily) European carmakers were separately taking a hit after Renault cut its sales and profitability forecasts last night, sending Renault, Daimler and Fiat Chrysler shares lower The CMA also told Nationwide to compensation thousands of customers up to \u00a32m collectively, after failing to properly inform them about PPI contracts The Serious Fraud Office then announced that its investigation into Libor manipulation has come to a close, drawing a line under a scandal that has cost billions of pounds worth of fines, led to job losses and the jailing of UBS trader Tom Hayes All eyes will now turn to tomorrow\u2019s historic Saturday sitting in Parliament, where MPs will vote on Boris\u2019 Brexit withdrawal deal. Expect some currency volatility if his plans sour. Try to have a good weekend \u2013 we\u2019ll be back on Monday. It\u2019s a subdued open for US stocks, with all three major indexes starting the American trading session nearly flat: Dow Jones -0.04% S&amp;P 500 -0.05% NASDAQ -0.05% Little can be done about China\u2019s slowing growth - it\u2019s natural. That\u2019s the view of Stefan Legge, lecturer, economist and trade expert from Switzerland\u2019s University of St. Gallen. He says there\u2019s no way a country like China should be expected keep up its previous rate of growth: No country in history has achieved the track record of GDP growth that China has shown. According to data from the World Bank, China\u2019s GDP has grown by more than 3.9% in every single year since 1977. Even the Southeast-Asian tiger countries did not achieve this. Long run growth in GDP is driven by resource accumulation and mobilisation as well as by innovation. Legge adds: In China, due to population ageing the labor force is already on a shrinking trajectory and there is little that can be done about it. Capital accumulation (that is infrastructure or machinery) faces decreasing marginal returns: the first highways and railways generated more economic growth than current projects. Finally, improvements in productivity through innovation is much harder and slower than through imitation. China has reached a middle-income status and most countries face slowing GDP growth at this point. In sum, it is natural to expect China\u2019s economy to grow at a slower rate in the coming years \u2013 even in the absence of a trade dispute with the United States. There is little insight in calling every new GDP growth figure \u2018the lowest in thirty years\u2019. Once it\u2019s on Twitter, it\u2019s official. Christine Lagarde has been formally appointed as the incoming head of the European Central Bank. She even tweeted a photo with Mario Draghi himself to mark the occasion. The Serious Fraud Office has announced that its investigation into Libor manipulation has come to a close. It means there will be no further charges in the case. The move effectively draws a line under the scandal, which saw bankers manipulate the Libor interest rate benchmark that set the price banks would pay to borrow from each other. It led to billions of pounds worth of fines, job losses and the jailing of UBS trader Tom Hayes. Here\u2019s the SFO\u2019s statement: More from my colleague Phillip Inman on the UK construction data covering 2018 out today. Worth noting the \u201castonishingly high\u201d average weekly pay for workers recorded last year: Construction-related employment in Great Britain increased by 2.8% in 2018 to reach its highest level on record, with the South East, London and the East of England contributing 41.1% of total employment. And average weekly earnings increased to \u00a3635.66 per week in December 2018, well above the \u00a3496 weekly pay of the average worker and second only to the finance and business services sector. This astonishingly high pay is stunning when the Labour productivity figures show that productivity, as measured by output per hour, fell by 4.8% in 2018 compared with the previous year. The industry also contributes to the UK\u2019s huge trade deficit, importing more construction materials and components than it exports to the extent that it reached \u00a310.6bn in 2018, with imports being more than double the value of exports. Guardian economics writer Phillip Inman has been looking at construction figures for 2018 released today from the Office for National Statistics. The ONS has opened a window on the construction industry that goes to show how it works to its own rules. And how dependent it is on the public sector. The figures for 2018 reveal that the value of new work across the industry reached its highest level on record at \u00a3113.1bn. This was driven by growth in public sector work of \u00a32.7bn. The private sector only accounted for \u00a3750m of the increase. However, while its backlog of work meant the industry was booming, new orders fell by 13.2%, or \u00a39.3bn, the first annual decline in growth seen since 2011. We have seen this year that the fall in new orders translated into a long recession in the sector. He adds that the number of construction firms surged to their highest level on record in 2018, with 325,736 registered firms operating in Great Britain in 2018. That\u2019s an increase of 11,146 (or 3.5%) compared with the previous year. But don\u2019t get too excited: The suspicion must be that many of the \u201cfirms\u201d were phoenix-like operations that had risen from the ashes of \u201cbust\u201d firms, or more likely firms that exploited lax procedures at Companies House to disappear and rise again. The construction sector suffered 3,202 insolvencies, which is the highest of any sector in 2018 and a 14.7% increase on the 2,792 insolvencies seen in 2017. The US dollar is set for its worst week in almost 4 months against a basket of global currencies, after being hit by Brexit-related rallies of both the pound and euro. Depending on the outcome of Saturday\u2019s vote in Parliament, that steady decline could continue into next week. Boris Johnson has penned an open letter to British business, praising not only his own deal but also the \u201cinspiring\u201d and \u201chard working\u201d business community. The Sun\u2019s deputy political editor quips it\u2019s a shift in tone from the PM: The PPI story keeps rolling on and on and on... This time the Competition and Markets Authority has ordered Nationwide to refund more than 7,000 customers who either did not receive or were sent inaccurate information reminders about payment protection insurance. It meant people didn\u2019t have the proper info to help them decide if they wanted to continue paying PPI, or were misled into thinking their PPI was cheaper than it actually was. The CMA has also told Nationwide to make sure it has the proper procedures in place to make sure similar problems don\u2019t happen again. The watchdog said: Nationwide has broken the rules by not sending essential PPI reminders to their customers. 8 years on from our legally-binding order, it is simply unacceptable that the CMA is having to remind Britain\u2019s biggest banks of their legal obligations. Nationwide has failed its customers by denying them important information, and the directions we\u2019ve issued today will lead to affected customers receiving the refunds they deserve. Such breaches are serious and, if we had the extra powers we\u2019ve proposed to the government, could have resulted in fines. This come comes more than six weeks after the PPI complaints deadline at the end of August. Intercontinental Hotels Group is one of the worst performers on the FTSE 100 (down 2.8%) after the Holiday Inn-owner reported a 0.8% drop in Q3 revenue per room. It blamed lower business bookings in China and the ongoing protests in Hong Kong for the drop. And there\u2019s a link to economic growth here, with the slowdown in global expansion impacting business travel worldwide. Rival Hilton recently warned that revenue would be hit by lagging Chinese growth and the US-China trade war, while AccorHotels narrowed its full year profit guidance on similar concerns. An interesting tweet from Capital Economics, highlighting the increased importance of China in global trade today, compared to the early 1990s: The pound is now flat against the US dollar at $1.288 but its temporary lift this morning was chalked up to comments from Bank of England deputy governor Dave Ramsden. In an interview with Bloomberg, Ramsden took a slightly more hawkish tone than some of his colleagues, saying that he still saw a case for gradually increasing interest rates...that is, if the UK manages a smooth exit from the EU: The kind of guidance we\u2019ve been giving - in the world of a deal it still applies. Referring to the BoE\u2019s long-standing guidance on rates, Ramsden added: We\u2019re not saying over what timeframe, but limited and gradual (rate increases) is a reasonable qualitative framing. While some analysts are betting that China\u2019s central bank, the PBOC, will be more willing to ease monetary policy on the back of weaker GDP, we\u2019ve got some contrarians in the mix. Case in point: Stephen Innes, AxiTrader\u2019s Asia-Pacific market strategist. He says: While the weaker China GDP suggests an economic pull to ease monetary policy to support the real economy... a 6 % GDP won\u2019t necessarily add to the case for urgent stimulus, as the 6.0-6.5% range is with the government\u2019s annual target, and so far China is facing limited risk in breaching this for the year. If there\u2019s one thing China\u2019s massive army of retail equity investor like it\u2019s the thought of easy money from the PBOC. Unfortunately for China stock market investors, the PBOC are not so willing at this stage. Innes adds that, away from the stock markets, many traders appear less concerned about the Q3 GDP figures: Currency and rates traders aren\u2019t getting bent out of shape by backwards-looking data. Instead, they remain focused on what lies ahead, which is hopefully the US administration scrapping some of those tariffs which would be an unmitigated positive for global growth. After hitting a five-month high against the US dollar on Thursday amid Brexit deal hopes, the pound is continuing to hover at $1.29. Versus the euro, sterling is trading at \u20ac1.158. But Naeem Aslam of Think Markets reckons the rise won\u2019t last long (depending on the outcome of Parliament\u2019s much-anticipated vote on Johnson\u2019s withdrawal deal on Saturday, of course) Sadly, traders aren\u2019t going to get much pleasure to enjoy the Friday feeling or get any sleep over this weekend because of the chaotic Brexit situation. We think this could be a chance to go short on Sterling. If the deal is rejected in Parliament, sterling is likely to fall off the cliff due to a no-deal Brexit threat. On the flip slide\u2014only if a miracle happens\u2014the deal gets green light in parliament, the sterling-dollar is going to shoot above the 1.35 mark\u2014something we said yesterday. While China\u2019s economic growth is suffering the effects of a trade war with the US, the EU is from today facing a new set of tariffs on American-bound exports. As my colleague Jasper Jolly writes: British manufacturers of products ranging from Scotch whisky to biscuits and Savile Row suits are braced for a significant financial hit after US tariffs came into effect in retaliation for subsidies given to aerospace manufacturer Airbus. Tariffs of 25% came into effect at midnight on the US east coast (5am BST), damaging small businesses with few links to a 15-year aerospace industry battle between Airbus, the European champion, and American rival Boeing. A broad variety of products across the EU have been hit by the tariffs, including French wine, Italian parmesan and Spanish olives. Read the full story here: It\u2019s been a pretty lacklustre start to the Friday session across European markets: FTSE 100 -0.15% CAC 40 -0.42% DAX +0.07% FTSE MIB +0.25% Connor Campbell, a financial analyst at SpreadEx, said it\u2019s an understandable reaction to the Chinese growth figures: As the pound holds its breath ahead of \u2018super Saturday\u2019, the markets dealt with another disastrous \u2013 well, relative to the country\u2019s usual performance \u2013 figure out of China. Coming in at a worse than forecast 6.0%, China\u2019s third quarter GDP reading saw growth at its lowest for nearly 3 decades... The country is clearly continuing to feel the trade war squeeze, putting all the more pressure on the so-far insubstantial \u2013 and uncertain, given the dispute over Hong Kong \u2013 \u2018partial trade deal\u2019 announced last weekend. Over in Europe, carmakers are taking a hit after Renault cut its sales guidance and profitability forecasts. Renault made the admission after yesterday\u2019s close and markets are now getting a chance to react to the news, sending shares down -11% and making it the worst performer on the CAC 40. The company said yesterday that sales were likely to drop between 3-4% this year, while its operating margin was set to come in at 5% compared to its previous target of 6%. Carmakers have been struggling with falling demand in key markets like China, while straining to meet European emissions requirements and invest in new tech to producer cleaner car models. It\u2019s the latest challenge for Renault, which recently ousted its CEO Thierry Bollore as part of a leadership overhaul. The company has been trying to draw a line under a scandal linked to former boss Carlos Ghosn, who is alleged to have misused company funds. The knock on effects of Renault\u2019s sales warning has sent Fiat Chrysler shares down -2.4% and Daimler down nearly 2%. Chinese stocks haven\u2019t fared well in the wake of the GDP data, with the Shanghai Composite Index dropping by -1.2% Elsewhere, Hong Kong\u2019s Heng Seng fell -0.46%, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 rose +0.18%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. While uncertainty over Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal hits front pages in Europe, China\u2019s slowing growth is dominating news out of Asia. Fresh figures released overnight show Chinese GDP grew just 6% between July and September. That\u2019s less than economist forecasts for 6.1%, slower than the 6.2% expansion recorded in the previous quarter, and is the lowest level recorded since the early 1990s. While that\u2019s still within the Chinese government\u2019s 6.0-6.5% target range, it\u2019s a stark reminder that Beijing\u2019s superhuman growth can\u2019t last forever. Unsurprisingly, the country\u2019s trade war with the US has taken a toll on the Chinese economy, which is also struggling to drum up enough domestic demand to support its growth. There was a notable improvement in Chinese industrial production in September, which grew 5.8% year-on-year in September compared to 4.4% in August while retail sales came in at 7.8% compared to 7.5% a month earlier. But the headline figure for third quarter growth has still raised the likelihood that Beijing will resort to interest rate cuts or other stimulus measures to give the economy a bit of a boost.

Jacopo Tintoretto</strong> <br>Damaged and darkened by time and even partly repainted, this panoramic painting still has a smoky power and presence that stays with you. In fact it\u2019s one of the most oddly unforgettable masterpieces in Britain. Tintoretto was a younger contemporary of Titian who took 16th-century Venetian art into new realms of mysticism. He was a far more passionate Christian than either Titian or his rival Veronese, and that intensity is what makes this brooding scene so atmospheric. Christ, the son of God, abases himself. Tintoretto paints this not as a realistic scene but a vision he is sharing with us \u2013 a sublime moment of sepulchral drama in the gathering dark. <br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/jacopo-tintoretto-christ-washing-the-feet-of-the-disciples\">National Gallery</a>, London</p> <h2>Don\u2019t forget</h2> <p>To follow us on Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Gdnartanddesign?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@GdnArtandDesign</a>.</p> <h2>Sign up to the Art Weekly newsletter</h2> <p>If you\u2019d like to receive our regular roundup of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/oct/19/sign-up-to-the-art-weekly-email\">art and design news via email, please sign up here</a>.</p>",

In fact it\u2019s one of the most oddly unforgettable masterpieces in Britain. Tintoretto was a younger contemporary of Titian who took 16th-century Venetian art into new realms of mysticism. He was a far more passionate Christian than either Titian or his rival Veronese, and that intensity is what makes this brooding scene so atmospheric. Christ, the son of God, abases himself. Tintoretto paints this not as a realistic scene but a vision he is sharing with us \u2013 a sublime moment of sepulchral drama in the gathering dark. \u2022 National Gallery, London Don\u2019t forget To follow us on Twitter: @GdnArtandDesign.

      "bodyText": "The University of Bristol is paying for night-time police patrols in areas around its campus after years of complaints from residents about loud parties and disruption caused by its growing number of students living in rented houses. While a number of British universities already fund or subsidise police activities to safeguard students and staff, Bristol appears to be the first university to pay for police to protect residents from students. The university says it is paying Avon and Somerset police \u00a325,000 for Operation Beech, which includes dedicated patrols until 2am on Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays, with locals given a phone number to report noisy behaviour. A police spokesperson said the move was \u201ca response to issues of antisocial behaviour reported by residents in areas with a significant Bristol University student population\u201d. But those living in the worst-affected areas around the university \u2013 the Redland and Cotham districts to the north of the main campus \u2013 say the university has failed to rein in the behaviour of its students living in private accommodation and appears to be more interested in deflecting bad publicity than in tackling the problem. Andrew Waller, who has been living in Redland since 2006, said the problem had been acute for the past five years as the university had expanded and more undergraduates were renting privately in the area. \u201cWhen I moved in I wasn\u2019t aware of any of this sort of stuff. Students didn\u2019t really cause us any problems.

Operation Beech was first trialled at the end of last academic year, and the university decided to go ahead with 40 nights of patrols spread across peak party periods during the academic year.

Like HIGNFY, the book\u2019s authors, Steve Lowe and Alan McArthur, have created a successful satirical franchise that leaves what it satirises untouched.

Ian Hislop and Paul Merton, in fact, unwittingly helped Boris Johnson become prime minister. In a superb <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/v35/n14/jonathan-coe/sinking-giggling-into-the-sea\" title=\"\">essay</a> in the London Review of Books, the novelist Jonathan Coe recalled a moment 21 years ago when Johnson went on HIGNFY. Hislop had Johnson on the ropes over his notorious phone call with his friend Darius Guppy, when the pair discussed the possibility of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/14/journalist-stuart-collier-boris-johnson-phone-call-darius-guppy-demands-apology\" title=\"\">beating up an unfriendly journalist</a>.

Six years after Coe\u2019s article, Johnson is the prime minister we deserve. Today, Johnson is stronger for being laughable, and the laughter he attracts serves as a force field to stop us thinking too hard about the hash he is making of the UK\u2019s gravest crisis since Suez. Better to giggle over Jon Culshaw\u2019s send-up of Johnson on Radio 4\u2019s Dead Ringers than do the hard work of comprehending the self-satirising disaster of Johnson\u2019s plan for multiple checkpoints in post-Brexit Ireland.</p> <p>This is what author Malcolm Gladwell calls the \u201c<a href=\"http://revisionisthistory.com/episodes/10-the-satire-paradox\" title=\"\">satire paradox</a>\u201d: the funnier someone finds it, the less likely they are to be changed by it. And it\u2019s hardly a new problem. During the UK\u2019s \u201csatire boom\u201d, in the early 1960s, Michael Frayn worried that its purported targets were left unscathed. \u201cCertain kinds of satirical writing (political satire is a good example) are not normally intended to convert one\u2019s opponents, but to gratify and fortify one\u2019s friends,\u201d he wrote. That\u2019s why we should have few hopes that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/28/spitting-image-returns-chaotic-times-trump-putin-zuckerberg\" title=\"\">return of Spitting Image</a> will have much effect: after all, it achieved nothing first time around apart from making us laugh.

Laughter, as produced by satire, facilitates that civic privatism.</p> <p>Meanwhile, another satirical TV news quiz is due to return shortly. Mock the Week effectively mocks the weak, namely its demographic of couch potatoes, by inviting its powerless audience to laugh instead of changing what they are laughing at.

Certainly no one in the Trump administration or the FBI is going to be patting Morris on the back.

Morris\u2019s new film, The Day Shall Come, dramatises the absurd true story of how the FBI became the biggest recruiters of terrorists in the US. It would make up a terrorist plot, find people to try to carry it out and then arrest them. The aim? To make it look like the feds were on top of terrorism. Certainly no one in the Trump administration or the FBI is going to be patting Morris on the back. Yet like all satire in today\u2019s era of fake news, the film risks angrily preaching to the choir and bolstering its cynicism, while the satirised carry on regardless. \u201cThese are the headlines,\u201d Chris Morris\u2019s deadpan newsreader said on The Day Today, his mid-1990s news spoof. \u201cGod, I wish they weren\u2019t.\u201d Today the headlines are even worse but satire\u2019s chance of changing them is just as remote. \u2022 Stuart Jeffries is a feature writer",

The basis of the legal challenge by the anti-Brexit campaigner Jolyon Maugham QC was that the newly agreed deal contravened legislation \u2013 originally amended by hardline Brexiters to stymie the backstop arrangement \u2013 that prevents Northern Ireland forming part of a separate customs territory. Sitting before Lord Pentland, the court of session in Edinburgh heard from Aidan O\u2019Neill QC that the provisions of the new withdrawal agreement made it plain that Northern Ireland would form part of a separate customs territory, that of the EU, and that this breached section 55 of the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Act 2018, which states that it is \u201cunlawful for Her Majesty\u2019s government to enter into arrangements under which Northern Ireland forms part of a separate customs territory to Great Britain\u201d. Noting that section 55 \u2013 the result of an amendment sponsored by the hardline European Research Group \u2013 \u201cintended to tie the government\u2019s hands\u201d, O\u2019Neill added that whether Northern Ireland formed part of a separate customs territory after Brexit was \u201ca question of objective law\u201d and it \u201ccan\u2019t be plainer\u201d that the UK government had acted unlawfully. But Gerry Moynihan QC for the UK government argued the petition was beyond the competency of the court, saying it was inviting the court to \u201cinhibit\u201d consideration of the agreement. \u201cThis is a manifest attempt to interfere with proceedings in parliament,\u201d he told Pentland. He added that a substantial part of Northern Ireland\u2019s trade would remain part of the UK\u2019s customs territory and therefore section 55 would be complied with. Moynihan also presented a letter from the Speaker\u2019s counsel, which warned that Maugham\u2019s petition was asking for action that would \u201cinevitably involve interference on proceedings in parliament and as a breach of the separation of powers\u201d. On Friday evening, Pentland rejected the campaigners\u2019 argument that the agreement was unlawful, writing in his verdict that the petition was \u201cof very-doubtful competency\u201d. The judge added: \u201cThe orders sought would unquestionably interfere to a major extent to the proposed proceedings in parliament. \u201cI cannot see that it would be right for parliament to be invited to consider a draft treaty which the court had suspended on the basis that it was unlawful. \u201cIt is a cardinal principle of constitutional law that the courts should not intrude on the legitimate affairs and processes of parliament. \u201cI consider that it should be left to parliament to proceed in relation to the draft withdrawal agreement in the manner and according to the procedures that parliament considers most appropriate.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Running With Scissors author Augusten Burroughs has revealed an unusual detail about himself that he failed to mention in any of his previous seven memoirs: he is a witch.</p> <p>Burroughs\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/augusten-burroughs/toil-amp-trouble/\">Toil &amp; Trouble</a>, out this month in the US, reveals how he first became aware of his \u201cmagickal\u201d powers: aged eight, he was on the school bus and became convinced something terrible had happened to his grandmother. When he got home, his mother \u2013 whose decision to give Burroughs away to be raised by her psychiatrist is detailed in Running With Scissors \u2013 was on the phone, having learned that Augusten\u2019s grandmother had been in a car accident and was in hospital.</p> <p>\u201cHesitantly I asked, \u2018Mom? How did I know?\u2019\u201d writes Burroughs. His mother replies: \u201c\u2018You are <em>my</em> son. <em>That\u2019s</em> how you knew,\u2019\u201d and explains that many of his ancestors were witches, escaping witch trials in Lancaster, England because \u201cthey <em>were</em> witches and could elude detection\u201d.</p> <p>She goes on to tutor him in magick, telling him the absence of \u201cancient texts\u201d on the topic is because \u201cso much of our written early culture was destroyed. So it has always been the Way for one witch to verbally pass the knowledge on to another.\u201d He learns that while \u201ca witch can\u2019t turn a person into an owl. Or fly on a broom. Or defy the laws of physics. We can\u2019t do anything that\u2019s impossible. But we can do many things that people believe are impossible. When something is hanging in the balance, as they say, we can add more \u2026 sort of molecular weight on the side of the outcome we desire.\u201d</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://therumpus.net/2019/10/the-rumpus-interview-with-augusten-burroughs/\">an interview with the Rumpus</a>, Burroughs said he suspected that being a witch was genetic, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s universally encoded within all humans or only in certain humans, say humans with a certain percentage of Neanderthal DNA, or what other variables may be at play.</p> <p>\u201cIt would make sense to me if the thing called witchcraft began in the very earliest days of our human journey, when the male was out hunting and the woman was left at home in the cave,\u201d he speculated. \u201cIf harm were to arrive at the cave, she would need a way to communicate this to her mate. She would need to text him, basically. So to have cellular tissue that could send and receive data without respect to distance would greatly benefit the species.\u201d</p> <p>St Martin\u2019s Press, his US publisher, described the memoir as \u201ca chronicle of one man\u2019s journey to understand himself, to reconcile the powers he can wield with things with which he is helpless\u201d.</p> <p>The publisher added: \u201cThere are very few things that are coincidences, as you will learn in Toil &amp; Trouble. Ghosts are real, trees can want to kill you, beavers are the spawn of Satan, houses are alive, and in the end, love is the most powerful magic of all.\u201d</p> <p>Atlantic, which has published some of Burroughs\u2019s previous books in the UK, has no current plans to release Toil &amp; Trouble.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was corrected on 21 October 2019, to correct the name of the UK publisher of Burroughs\u2019s books.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Running With Scissors author Augusten Burroughs has revealed an unusual detail about himself that he failed to mention in any of his previous seven memoirs: he is a witch. Burroughs\u2019s Toil &amp; Trouble, out this month in the US, reveals how he first became aware of his \u201cmagickal\u201d powers: aged eight, he was on the school bus and became convinced something terrible had happened to his grandmother. When he got home, his mother \u2013 whose decision to give Burroughs away to be raised by her psychiatrist is detailed in Running With Scissors \u2013 was on the phone, having learned that Augusten\u2019s grandmother had been in a car accident and was in hospital. \u201cHesitantly I asked, \u2018Mom? How did I know?\u2019\u201d writes Burroughs. His mother replies: \u201c\u2018You are my son. That\u2019s how you knew,\u2019\u201d and explains that many of his ancestors were witches, escaping witch trials in Lancaster, England because \u201cthey were witches and could elude detection\u201d. She goes on to tutor him in magick, telling him the absence of \u201cancient texts\u201d on the topic is because \u201cso much of our written early culture was destroyed. So it has always been the Way for one witch to verbally pass the knowledge on to another.\u201d He learns that while \u201ca witch can\u2019t turn a person into an owl. Or fly on a broom. Or defy the laws of physics. We can\u2019t do anything that\u2019s impossible. But we can do many things that people believe are impossible. When something is hanging in the balance, as they say, we can add more \u2026 sort of molecular weight on the side of the outcome we desire.\u201d In an interview with the Rumpus, Burroughs said he suspected that being a witch was genetic, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s universally encoded within all humans or only in certain humans, say humans with a certain percentage of Neanderthal DNA, or what other variables may be at play. \u201cIt would make sense to me if the thing called witchcraft began in the very earliest days of our human journey, when the male was out hunting and the woman was left at home in the cave,\u201d he speculated. \u201cIf harm were to arrive at the cave, she would need a way to communicate this to her mate. She would need to text him, basically. So to have cellular tissue that could send and receive data without respect to distance would greatly benefit the species.\u201d St Martin\u2019s Press, his US publisher, described the memoir as \u201ca chronicle of one man\u2019s journey to understand himself, to reconcile the powers he can wield with things with which he is helpless\u201d. The publisher added: \u201cThere are very few things that are coincidences, as you will learn in Toil &amp; Trouble. Ghosts are real, trees can want to kill you, beavers are the spawn of Satan, houses are alive, and in the end, love is the most powerful magic of all.\u201d Atlantic, which has published some of Burroughs\u2019s previous books in the UK, has no current plans to release Toil &amp; Trouble. \u2022 This article was corrected on 21 October 2019, to correct the name of the UK publisher of Burroughs\u2019s books.",

      "body": "<p>A church warden has been jailed for life after being found guilty of murdering a university lecturer following a sustained campaign of physical and mental abuse.</p> <p>Benjamin Field, 28, was convicted in August of killing Peter Farquhar, 69, a retired teacher and part-time university lecturer, to inherit his house and money, and then trying to make his death look like an accident or suicide.</p> <p>Field was given life imprisonment with a minimum term of 36 years by Mr Justice Sweeney at Oxford crown court on Friday.</p> <p>Detectives branded Field a psychopath and said he would have posed an \u201congoing danger to society\u201d had he not been stopped.</p> <p>After Farquhar\u2019s death in October 2015, Field, a Baptist minister\u2019s son, began targeting Farquhar\u2019s neighbour, 83-year-old Ann Moore-Martin, a deeply religious retired headteacher. He wrote messages on her mirrors purporting to be from God.</p> <p>After protracted deliberations, Field was cleared of charges of conspiracy to murder and the attempted murder of Moore-Martin, who lived a few doors away from Farquhar in the village of Maids Moreton. Moore-Martin died from natural causes in May 2017.</p> <p>The judge Mr Justice Sweeney said Field \u201clived by deception and deceit and had been a well-practised and able liar\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cThe evidence at trial clearly demonstrated grandiosity, a sense of superiority towards others, the exploitation of others to achieve personal gain, the need to belittle and humiliate others, fixation on fantasies of power and success, intelligence, a need for admiration from others and a sense of entitlement, together with an unwillingness to empathise with the feelings, needs and wishes of others.\u201d</p> <p>David Jeremy QC, the defence lawyer, said two psychiatrists had said Field had either a narcissistic personality disorder or a psychopathic personality disorder. \u201cHe was and is an intelligent and educated man and chose to apply those gifts towards the manipulation and humiliation of his victims, leading to the murder of Peter Farquhar and the degradation of Ann Moore-Martin and the causing of irreparable harm to their families and those close to them,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Prosecutors said Field had a \u201cprofound fascination in controlling and manipulating and humiliating and killing\u201d, and they alleged he had plotted his crimes with a friend, Martyn Smith.</p> <p>Smith, 32, a failed magician, was cleared of murdering Farquhar and of conspiracy to murder and the attempted murder of Moore-Martin.</p> <p>During the trial, jurors were told of Field\u2019s elaborate project of befriending elderly individuals who were vulnerable and lonely and then defrauding them by allowing them to think he was in a loving relationship with them.

      "bodyText": "A church warden has been jailed for life after being found guilty of murdering a university lecturer following a sustained campaign of physical and mental abuse. Benjamin Field, 28, was convicted in August of killing Peter Farquhar, 69, a retired teacher and part-time university lecturer, to inherit his house and money, and then trying to make his death look like an accident or suicide. Field was given life imprisonment with a minimum term of 36 years by Mr Justice Sweeney at Oxford crown court on Friday. Detectives branded Field a psychopath and said he would have posed an \u201congoing danger to society\u201d had he not been stopped. After Farquhar\u2019s death in October 2015, Field, a Baptist minister\u2019s son, began targeting Farquhar\u2019s neighbour, 83-year-old Ann Moore-Martin, a deeply religious retired headteacher. He wrote messages on her mirrors purporting to be from God. After protracted deliberations, Field was cleared of charges of conspiracy to murder and the attempted murder of Moore-Martin, who lived a few doors away from Farquhar in the village of Maids Moreton. Moore-Martin died from natural causes in May 2017. The judge Mr Justice Sweeney said Field \u201clived by deception and deceit and had been a well-practised and able liar\u201d. He added: \u201cThe evidence at trial clearly demonstrated grandiosity, a sense of superiority towards others, the exploitation of others to achieve personal gain, the need to belittle and humiliate others, fixation on fantasies of power and success, intelligence, a need for admiration from others and a sense of entitlement, together with an unwillingness to empathise with the feelings, needs and wishes of others.\u201d David Jeremy QC, the defence lawyer, said two psychiatrists had said Field had either a narcissistic personality disorder or a psychopathic personality disorder. \u201cHe was and is an intelligent and educated man and chose to apply those gifts towards the manipulation and humiliation of his victims, leading to the murder of Peter Farquhar and the degradation of Ann Moore-Martin and the causing of irreparable harm to their families and those close to them,\u201d he said. Prosecutors said Field had a \u201cprofound fascination in controlling and manipulating and humiliating and killing\u201d, and they alleged he had plotted his crimes with a friend, Martyn Smith. Smith, 32, a failed magician, was cleared of murdering Farquhar and of conspiracy to murder and the attempted murder of Moore-Martin. During the trial, jurors were told of Field\u2019s elaborate project of befriending elderly individuals who were vulnerable and lonely and then defrauding them by allowing them to think he was in a loving relationship with them. He encouraged them to change their will to benefit him and then began a devastating campaign of physical and mental torture. Field admitted to poisoning, gaslighting and defrauding Farquhar in order to get a better job and inherit his wealth when he died, and he told the court he had also deceived and manipulated Moore-Martin in a similar way. He accepted he had \u201cpsychologically manipulated\u201d the pair but he denied any involvement in their deaths. Field drew up a list of 100 future \u201ctargets\u201d, including his own parents and grandparents, the court heard. He told the jury the \u201c100 clients\u201d file was not just a list of future targets but of people who could help him. The Crown Prosecution Service said the case was like a \u201cplot from a novel\u201d. Field and Smith met Farquhar when they were students at Buckingham University. Field struck up a friendship with the university lecturer and began lodging with him. Oliver Saxby QC, the lead prosecutor, told the jury that Field saw that Farquhar was vulnerable, \u201cand this was something from the very outset he decided to exploit\u201d. Field and Farquhar soon entered into a relationship and had a formal ceremony, which they called a betrothal ceremony. Like Farquhar, Moore-Martin was unmarried and had no children. Saxby told the court she was \u201cfundamentally lonely\u201d. In a statement, the Church of England diocese of Oxford said: \u201cThe sentencing of Ben Field marks the conclusion of a long, complex and disturbing case. It\u2019s clear that Ben Field manipulated everyone he came into contact with. We\u2019re determined to learn what we can from this extraordinary case.

They lost all of the games they played and only picked up points because their match against each other was called off for bad weather and recorded as a 0-0 draw., 4:C - The tournament is being hosted in one stadium in Sydney over two days, with 12 men\u2019s teams and four women\u2019s teams taking part., 5:D - Pasculli played his part in Argentina's success, scoring the only goal of the game as they beat neighbours Uruguay in the last-16., 6:C - There were no goals in the game between North Korea and South Korea, but there were some tasty tackles. \"The opponents were very rough and there were moments when very abusive language was exchanged,\" said South Korea captain Son Heung-min. \"It was hard to concentrate on the match because you were thinking about avoiding injury.\", 7:D - Walker took it well. \"This was my first competitive round since 2011 or 2012,\" she said. \"Now that I don\u2019t play the LPGA anymore, I don\u2019t watch golf.

I like being in that Robin Hood position.\u201d Cowie sees the role as being a way to support more obscure artists, and insists licensing budgets are at a certain level before he will even begin to talk to a studio about a project.</p> <p>But picking obscure tracks can cause problems. Cowie decided to used hard-to-clear <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2008/sep/01/sceneandhearditalodisco\">Italo Disco</a> tracks such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AScrmLcSarQ\">Pino d\u2019Angio</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AScrmLcSarQ\">\u2019s Okay Okay</a> in an episode of Master of None\u2019s second season. \u201cThe number-one source of drama in my job is getting someone attached to something we can\u2019t keep,\u201d says Cowie. \u201cThere\u2019s this phenomenon called \u2018temp love\u2019 where you cut a scene with a track, everyone loves it and you figure out you can\u2019t keep it, and no one will ever be happy with anything else.\u201d</p> <p>But there is a practical benefit to finding more obscure songs to include, too. \u201cAt a certain point some of these songs are going to run out of emotional steam because they\u2019ve been attached to so many things. The right unknown song, in the right scene, can do so much for your story.\u201d</p>",

Then there are the \u201cindy indies\u201d, which cost a bit less, and then artist-owned music, which is generally the cheapest to secure. \u201cAs everyone knows, you don\u2019t make shit from streaming, record sales are down and you have to be at a certain level to make any money from music,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the right commercial or show can finance your next project. I like being in that Robin Hood position.\u201d Cowie sees the role as being a way to support more obscure artists, and insists licensing budgets are at a certain level before he will even begin to talk to a studio about a project. But picking obscure tracks can cause problems. Cowie decided to used hard-to-clear Italo Disco tracks such as Pino d\u2019Angio\u2019s Okay Okay in an episode of Master of None\u2019s second season. \u201cThe number-one source of drama in my job is getting someone attached to something we can\u2019t keep,\u201d says Cowie. \u201cThere\u2019s this phenomenon called \u2018temp love\u2019 where you cut a scene with a track, everyone loves it and you figure out you can\u2019t keep it, and no one will ever be happy with anything else.\u201d But there is a practical benefit to finding more obscure songs to include, too. \u201cAt a certain point some of these songs are going to run out of emotional steam because they\u2019ve been attached to so many things. The right unknown song, in the right scene, can do so much for your story.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Inherited tastes in wines, and, for the lucky few, inherited wines, are not necessarily as gratifying as inherited recipes. That\u2019s because, while you can be swept away on a wave of nostalgia by making your mum\u2019s fish pie or chocolate brownies, wines change as they mature. And, given that many people hang on to them for far too long, there\u2019s a fair chance the bottle will be way over the hill by the time you get round to opening it. Still, on the bright side, you may uncover a gem.</p> <p>You may be surprised to learn that it\u2019s not necessarily reds that show best with age . Whites and sweet wines can also mature well \u2013 or not, in the case of white burgundy, which has a well-documented problem with \u201cpremox\u201d, or <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">premature oxidation</a>.</p> <p>Crisp whites and ros\u00e9s, too, benefit from being drunk young, but both riesling and semillon can age spectacularly well, as can Loire chenin blancs, such as vouvray and montlouis, which often take time to get into their stride. Whether you like the more complex, evolved flavours, however, is another matter, because tastes these days run to fresher, fruitier wines. Older vintages often need appropriate food \u2013 particularly classic French or Italian dishes \u2013 to show at their best.</p> <p>If you like the taste of older wines, it\u2019s worth trying to get hold of them when they\u2019re young, from both the point of view of availability and your bank balance \u2013 quality wines are obviously much cheaper when they first hit the market than once they have become scarce. Although vintages are less important than they once were, it also makes sense to lay in wines from a good year: 2016, for example, was good in both the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/jul/19/wine-rhone-whites-that-give-you-a-run-for-your-money\">Rh\u00f4ne</a> and Bordeaux.</p> <p>My best advice is to establish what exactly it is that you\u2019ve got stashed away. It\u2019s easy enough to find out online \u2013 most merchants give some kind of indication of a \u201cdrink by\u201d date, but that will be very much dependent on how the wine has been kept. It\u2019s also worth checking the value of the wine: anything that\u2019s less than \u00a310, say, I\u2019d be inclined to drink up asap, but when it gets to the \u00a330 mark, you might want to invite your wine-loving pals round.</p> <p>If in doubt, just dive in and open it anyway, though always with a back-up just in case it\u2019s corked or otherwise undrinkable. And treat it gently. Fragile old red burgundy probably won\u2019t benefit from decanting, while other wines may have thrown a deposit and will need to be decanted like a port (if you don\u2019t have a decanter, just use a jug). And don\u2019t overchill those old whites.</p> <h2>Four vintages worth holding on to</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"spacer\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;height: 1px; display: block; background: #DCDCDC; margin: 12px 0;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6e74ac8e7316f79b01ed2525995480711a5e6b3d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e74ac8e7316f79b01ed2525995480711a5e6b3d/0_0_1000_1000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Soraie Veneto Cecilia Beretta 2016\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Soraie Veneto Cecilia Beretta 2016</strong> </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.corneyandbarrow.com/soraie-igt-veneto-cecilia-beretta-2016-10102342016bt06-1.html\" title=\"\">\u00a311.95 Corney &amp; Barrow</a>, 14%. </p> <p>A passito described by the producer as a \u2018mini-amarone\u2019.

      "bodyText": "Inherited tastes in wines, and, for the lucky few, inherited wines, are not necessarily as gratifying as inherited recipes. That\u2019s because, while you can be swept away on a wave of nostalgia by making your mum\u2019s fish pie or chocolate brownies, wines change as they mature. And, given that many people hang on to them for far too long, there\u2019s a fair chance the bottle will be way over the hill by the time you get round to opening it. Still, on the bright side, you may uncover a gem. You may be surprised to learn that it\u2019s not necessarily reds that show best with age . Whites and sweet wines can also mature well \u2013 or not, in the case of white burgundy, which has a well-documented problem with \u201cpremox\u201d, or premature oxidation. Crisp whites and ros\u00e9s, too, benefit from being drunk young, but both riesling and semillon can age spectacularly well, as can Loire chenin blancs, such as vouvray and montlouis, which often take time to get into their stride. Whether you like the more complex, evolved flavours, however, is another matter, because tastes these days run to fresher, fruitier wines. Older vintages often need appropriate food \u2013 particularly classic French or Italian dishes \u2013 to show at their best. If you like the taste of older wines, it\u2019s worth trying to get hold of them when they\u2019re young, from both the point of view of availability and your bank balance \u2013 quality wines are obviously much cheaper when they first hit the market than once they have become scarce. Although vintages are less important than they once were, it also makes sense to lay in wines from a good year: 2016, for example, was good in both the Rh\u00f4ne and Bordeaux. My best advice is to establish what exactly it is that you\u2019ve got stashed away. It\u2019s easy enough to find out online \u2013 most merchants give some kind of indication of a \u201cdrink by\u201d date, but that will be very much dependent on how the wine has been kept. It\u2019s also worth checking the value of the wine: anything that\u2019s less than \u00a310, say, I\u2019d be inclined to drink up asap, but when it gets to the \u00a330 mark, you might want to invite your wine-loving pals round. If in doubt, just dive in and open it anyway, though always with a back-up just in case it\u2019s corked or otherwise undrinkable. And treat it gently. Fragile old red burgundy probably won\u2019t benefit from decanting, while other wines may have thrown a deposit and will need to be decanted like a port (if you don\u2019t have a decanter, just use a jug). And don\u2019t overchill those old whites. Four vintages worth holding on to Soraie Veneto Cecilia Beretta 2016 \u00a311.95 Corney &amp; Barrow, 14%. A passito described by the producer as a \u2018mini-amarone\u2019. Autumnal, rich, but surprisingly dry. Enjoy with cheese or rag\u00f9. Vasse Felix Filius Chardonnay 2016 \u00a39.95 ND John, \u00a313 Booths, 12.5%. Classy, creamy chardonnay from Australia\u2019s Margaret River. Drink with your mum\u2019s fish pie. Weinert Carrascal Corte Cl\u00e1sico Mendoza 2015 \u00a310.95 The Wine Society, 14.5%. Spicy Argentinian red that, despite its comparative youth, tastes like an old claret. Think roast pheasant or a comforting stew. Exquisite Collection Marqu\u00e9s de Carri\u00f3n Rioja Reserva 2015 \u00a37.99 Aldi, 13.5%. What you want from rioja, at a good price. Smooth, mellow and made for roast lamb. \u2022 For more by Fiona Beckett, go to matchingfoodandwine.com",

On paper Ireland have reason to believe. Their New Zealand-born coach, Joe Schmidt, has the much more settled side, with Johnny Sexton and Conor Murray starting their 56th Test together, while 12 of this Irish team started in their defeat of the All Blacks in Dublin 12 months ago. That 16-9 victory was Ireland\u2019s second over the world champions in the past three attempts. Yet where the All Blacks moved swiftly to significantly evolve their game after Dublin, Ireland stood still, losing twice to England and once each to Wales and Japan this year. It is no coincidence the All Blacks team who will run out at Tokyo Stadium on Saturday feature nine positional changes from their last Irish defeat. As their assistant coach, Ian Foster, stated, the twin twin-playmaker partnership of Richie Mo\u2019unga and Beauden Barrett leaves New Zealand\u2019s attacking structure barely recognisable from last season. \u201cWe always remember our losses pretty clearly but you try and learn from them and move forward,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting when you look at the number of things we\u2019ve changed in the past 12 months and a lot of those are because of some performances last year we weren\u2019t totally proud of.

Forecast rain should aid Ireland\u2019s conservative ball retention, box-kicking game-plan but it will not discourage New Zealand\u2019s intent to showcase their vast array of skill.

      "body": "<p>The New York Times\u2019 Modern Love column, a weekly first-person essay about love and relationships, is such an institution that it is a wonder it has taken so long to make a series out of it. It has already been spun off into a very good podcast, with the stories read by big-name stars. But Modern Love (Amazon Prime) for television continues the streaming giant\u2019s run of so-so dramas that can\u2019t quite break new ground. This should be a surefire success. It\u2019s A-list and painfully classy, but over eight episodes it only rarely lifts off, and instead settles into an oddly bland, will-this-do middle ground.</p> <p>I expected something along the lines of Easy, another half-hour anthology show about love and relationships. Easy was \u2013 well \u2013 easy to love, though this is far more wholesome. If Easy is a 4am taxi back to a stranger\u2019s house after a big night out, Modern Love is an afternoon coffee, but just one, because you both have somewhere else you would rather be. Its eight episodes follow lovestruck or lovelorn New Yorkers, and while it is mostly about romantic love, it has a healthy respect for the power of supportive friends and family, too. The first episode is about a doorman\u2019s years-long paternal affection for a woman who lives in the apartment building where he works; a later instalment is about a first date that ends up in a trip to the hospital. Episodes are pleasant, if slight, and if you\u2019ve seen any film about finding love in New York from the past 30 years, will feel very familiar.</p> <p>One of the biggest draws is episode three \u2013 Take Me As I Am, Whoever I Am\u2013 in which Anne Hathaway plays Lexi, a lawyer with bipolar disorder struggling to manage her highs and lows. It is by far the most distinctive of the eight, and views mental illness through an ambitiously theatrical lens. When she is manic, Lexi is a Rita Hayworth-esque bombshell who craves peaches in the middle of the night and charms men in the supermarket into having breakfast with her. When she is low, she can barely get out of bed and can only bring herself to eat muesli. John Carney, who executive produced the series and directs most of the episodes, has turned it into a sort of musical, with My Crazy Ex-Girlfriend flourishes and a joke about La La Land. Strange, then, that it is the stripped back scenes that ring most true: it finds its emotional core in a scene in a diner, with two women deciding simply to become friends. The razzle-dazzle window-dressing feels extraneous, with Hathaway\u2019s performance at its best when it is quietest.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c8040dcf28a986ca3b90f92581f3109bff7c9ca7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8040dcf28a986ca3b90f92581f3109bff7c9ca7/0_202_3900_2340/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dev Patel and Catherine Keener in Modern Love.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dev Patel and Catherine Keener in Modern Love.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Giovanni Rufino/Amazon Studios</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are two episodes that prove exceptions to Modern Love\u2019s mostly saccharine and straightforward worldview, and both have moments of honesty that feel authentic rather than stagey. When Cupid Is a Prying Journalist (I do not recognise this description of journalists) sees Dev Patel play a tech mogul who invented a dating site, while Catherine Keener is a writer sent to profile him. She asks him if he has ever been in love; they end up swapping stories about the one who got away. It nails the romance perfectly, in part because they are a great platonic pairing, but also because it allows each story to take a different path. One is fairytale, the other stoic. It is the episode that packs in the elegance you suspect they were reaching for elsewhere, and its finale is a genuine tearjerker.</p> <p>The other standout, Rallying to Keep the Game Alive, adds some much needed vinegar. Written and directed by Sharon Horgan, it stars Tina Fey and John Slattery as a long-married couple with two teenage children who are wondering why they\u2019re still together. They watch a film about penguins, and wonder what the point of long-term love is; they go to couples\u2019 therapy, and bicker their way through it, grasping impatiently for some common ground. (A line about whether cooking can be a hobby is the finest in the whole series.) Eventually, they settle on vicious, rule-breaking tennis. It is the least sentimental episode, and by far the best.</p> <p>Though they are based on true essays, the rest of the stories have a peculiar veneer of fantasy to them. As an occasional indulgence, it\u2019s sweet, but over eight episodes, it becomes sickly. That is to say nothing of its insistence on adding to the inexplicably long list of Ed Sheeran cameos out there in the world. Overall, the feeling is one of anecdotes that have been told over and over until they have been smoothed into one familiar shape, losing all of the rough, awkward edges of what actually happened over time.

Oil powered travel, exploration, science, industry and innovation. But it also powered conflict, both as a fuel and a potential spoil. It exacerbated inequality. And it polluted \u2013 oceans, rivers, wildernesses and, of course, the atmosphere. It is clear that we cannot go on like this. That is why it was heartening this week to learn that renewables were experiencing such strong growth that demand for oil might peak in the next decade. Barely a week goes by without some new renewables record being achieved. In London, environmental activists are glueing themselves to trains and railings to urge the transformation that can halt the climate crisis. It may be quietly and slowly happening already.

Most voters have already cast their ballots by post in the nationwide poll, which elects 245 members of Switzerland\u2019s federal assembly \u2013 200 to the lower house, known as national council, and 46 to the upper house, the council of states. The executive that will govern the country for the next four years, known as the federal council, will not be be decided until 11 December, with its seven cabinet positions divided among the four biggest parties in the two lower houses. Polls suggest the Greens, forecast to win more than 10% of the vote, against 7% in the 2015 elections, could overtake the centre-right Christian Democrats to take fourth spot and secure their first federal council seat. The Greens would be far more likely to claim a place in government if they join forces with the smaller Green Liberals party, which is also polling strongly at 7%, although the parties differ on issues including economic policy and may not be able to agree on a single unity candidate for a ministerial job. However, the vice-president of the Greens, Lisa Mazzone, told Agence-France Presse: \u201cWe have every intention of being a force in government, because I believe that is what Switzerland needs.\u201d Polls show the party is benefiting particularly from strong support among first-time voters and people who have previously abstained.

While that deal was exceptional, the royalties and boost to an artist\u2019s profile that use of their music in TV generates is significant at a time when physical sales of music are low.</p> <p>Despite being on the independent label Ninja Tune, the British electronic band <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/may/11/electronicmusic\">the Cinematic Orchestra</a> were one of the first acts to top the Hollywood Reporter\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/8099523/the-cinematic-orchestra-top-tv-songs-chart-january\">top TV songs chart</a> more than once, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/apr/22/jazz.shopping\">To Build a Home</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/oct/16/netflixs-growth-slows-as-it-braces-for-influx-of-competition\">Netflix's growth slows as it braces for influx of competition</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The track, which has been streamed almost 200m times on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/spotify\">Spotify</a>, hit the No 1 spot after appearing in Netflix\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jul/26/orange-is-the-new-black-final-series-review-netflix\">Orange is the New Black</a> and then again after being featured in NBC\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/apr/04/this-is-us-the-tv-show-that-lit-up-america-then-left-the-whole-world-cold\">This is Us</a>.</p> <p>Ninja Tune is one of many labels to respond to the increasing demand from TV and other media by <a href=\"https://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/tech/ninja-tune-launches-production-music-division/5123751.article\">launching a division dedicated to production music.</a></p> <p>The label\u2019s head of worldwide sync, Martin Dobson, said TV provided \u201ca robust income stream\u201d and it was only sensible for artists and labels to respond accordingly.</p> <p>He said: \u201cThe internet has led to a proliferation in TV, film and other audio-visual output, accordingly there are more opportunities for music to be used. We are fortunate enough to have experienced the music of several artists, including the Cinematic Orchestra, being used in artful and creatively sympathetic ways which have resulted in new interest \u2013 and when that happens it is almost immediately identifiable via streams, Shazams, social media and so on.\u201d</p> <p>In the past, viewers hooked by a TV song had to hunt it down using their ingenuity.

      "bodyText": "At a time when many critics believe we are living through a golden age of TV, it seems no new drama with aspirations to credibility is complete without a soundtrack to match. As content on on-demand platforms such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video has proliferated, and shows such as Stranger Things, Breaking Bad and Transparent have won acclaim, so fans have rushed to track down the music in their favourite shows. Figures provided exclusively to the Guardian by PRS (Performing Rights Society) for Music, show that the use of music across major on-demand platforms has more than tripled (up 238%) in the past five years \u2013 from 145bn minutes in 2014 to 490bn minutes in 2018. In 2012, the makers of Mad Men paid the Beatles $250,000 (then about \u00a3130,000) for the use of Tomorrow Never Knows. While that deal was exceptional, the royalties and boost to an artist\u2019s profile that use of their music in TV generates is significant at a time when physical sales of music are low. Despite being on the independent label Ninja Tune, the British electronic band the Cinematic Orchestra were one of the first acts to top the Hollywood Reporter\u2019s top TV songs chart more than once, with To Build a Home. The track, which has been streamed almost 200m times on Spotify, hit the No 1 spot after appearing in Netflix\u2019s Orange is the New Black and then again after being featured in NBC\u2019s This is Us. Ninja Tune is one of many labels to respond to the increasing demand from TV and other media by launching a division dedicated to production music. The label\u2019s head of worldwide sync, Martin Dobson, said TV provided \u201ca robust income stream\u201d and it was only sensible for artists and labels to respond accordingly. He said: \u201cThe internet has led to a proliferation in TV, film and other audio-visual output, accordingly there are more opportunities for music to be used. We are fortunate enough to have experienced the music of several artists, including the Cinematic Orchestra, being used in artful and creatively sympathetic ways which have resulted in new interest \u2013 and when that happens it is almost immediately identifiable via streams, Shazams, social media and so on.\u201d In the past, viewers hooked by a TV song had to hunt it down using their ingenuity. Now, apps such as Shazam and Tunefind, which is used in compilation of the TV songs chart, enable people to quickly identify a track and click straight through to purchasing or streaming platforms such as Spotify, YouTube and iTunes. Another British artist to benefit is the soul singer Michael Kiwanuka, whose Love &amp; Hate features on the acclaimed Netflix series When They See Us alongside another Cinematic Orchestra track, All Things to All Men. After Kiwanuka\u2019s track Cold Little Heart was the title track of HBO\u2019s Big Little Lies, he experienced a spike in his social media, his US tour dates sold out and the song remained in the Shazam Top 100 US chart for the entirety of the series. Such has been its impact that, in an interview with the Guardian, he was moved to amiably point out: \u201cI do have other music.\u201d PRS figures show the increase in music used has outstripped the rise in the number of programmes. While the number of programmes made available across major on-demand TV/film platforms has increased by 45% in the past five years, up from 147,000 to 212,500, the number of musical works featured rose 62%, from 488,500 to 789,500. Acknowledging the growing creative importance of TV soundtracks, the Emmys launched an outstanding music supervision award in 2017. The music journalist Eamonn Forde said TV syndication was now \u201cpart and parcel\u201d of how music labels make money. \u201cIt\u2019s hugely important as a form of revenue for published artists,\u201d he said. \u201cIf people aren\u2019t buying a physical product, if they\u2019re relying on streams from Spotify, YouTube, this is another way to make money.\u201d The hope for artists is they do not become known just for one track, but that this trend will encourage viewers to delve into their catalogue, he added. The increase in music use on TV has also benefited composers, who write specifically for TV and other media, PRS said, with the royalties it has distributed to them increasing by 18% between 2017 and 2018, and a steady increase predicted over the next 10 years.",

His teammate, Isabella Watts, agrees: \u201cBASE has definitely helped me to develop my confidence \u2013 I was never confident in standing up and presenting in front of people, but after today I feel a lot better about it because I just had to get up there and do it.\u201d Georgia Mears, also from the winning team, says BASE has changed her perception of accountancy. \u201cI feel like I understand it more now and maybe, hopefully, I could be one, one day.\u201d For those who choose to purse a career in a relevant field, the ICAEW offers a wide variety of resources to support their career aspirations, from apprenticeships to a foundation-level qualification. \u201cWe provide a huge range of resources to support students on their training journey, and we offer a free-to-use training vacancies website, which makes it as easy as possible for talent to find an employer.\u201d For Pip Langfield, head of careers at Ackworth school, Yorkshire, the competition offers \u201ca multitude of benefits\u201d for the young people who take part. \u201cThe experience has been invaluable to our students in the development of their employability skills,\u201d she says. \u201cThey have been able to apply all the theories and concepts they\u2019ve learned in the classroom to a real-life case study.\u201d Fiona Banks, head of business and economics at Sir Thomas Rich\u2019s school, Gloucester, thinks BASE affords students an invaluable insight into the world of work: \u201cIt\u2019s a great experience for all students and it brings to light the diversity of careers in accountancy.\u201d Ultimately, Spice says BASE is about inspiring the minds of the future: \u201cAs a body we\u2019re not just there to train chartered accountants. We exist to support society and public interest, and this is about giving something back to the next generation.\u201d Having attended the final for many years, Spice says it\u2019s inspiring for all who take part. \u201cThe employers who give up their time, free of charge, to take part tell us it\u2019s one day in the year when they feel really inspired about the next generation,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m always amazed by the young people who take part in BASE, and struck by the sense that the individuals in the room don\u2019t realise how impressive they are. It actually has a powerful emotional impact on me \u2013 I think it\u2019s the sense that the future of business is in safe hands.\u201d Find out more at ICAEW.com",

      "body": "<p><strong>Monday</strong></p> <p>This was the fourth Queen\u2019s speech that I have attended, but the first at which there have been plenty of empty seats on the Lords\u2019 benches. As is customary, the press were in the gallery an hour or so before kick-off and I assumed the gaps on the Tory benches would fill up closer to the start. But there was one pocket of about 12 places that remained stubbornly unfilled, apart from a top hat that had been left in situ as if to reserve a space. But the hat never did get claimed and it could still be there now for all I know. This was also the first time I had seen the Queen look quite so frail and furious. Having already been embarrassed by Boris Johnson over the unlawful first prorogation, she now found herself being used as a frontwoman to launch the Tory party\u2019s manifesto campaign as none of the measures brought forward have a hope of being delivered in the current parliament which is likely to last a matter of months at most. Rumour had it that trust between Buckingham Palace and Downing Street was so low that the Queen had demanded a copy of the speech five days in advance to make sure Johnson did not get the opportunity to sneak in anything untoward at the last minute. Throughout the 15-minute speech Her Majesty made sure her voice maintained a passive aggressive disgust, never once betraying a hint of enthusiasm for anything she was saying. I half expected her to end by ad-libbing that \u201cmy government will abolish the monarchy forthwith\u201d. Just to save herself from going though the whole thing again within months.</p> <p><strong>Tuesday</strong></p> <p>The Booker prize was shared between Bernardine Evaristo\u2019s Girl, Woman, Other and Margaret Atwood\u2019s The Testaments, and many literary critics were outraged that the judges had been unable to decide on a single winner. Inevitably some muttered that Atwood was being rewarded with a long-service medal and Evaristo should have been given the nod, but both winners took the decision far more graciously than those who were angry on their behalf. But it struck me as an entirely reasonable decision by the judges, even if it was one that broke the rules of the competition that had been established to prevent a repeat of 1992 when Michael Ondaatje and Barry Unsworth had shared the prize. Literary prizes have always been a matter of judgment. There is no VAR or goal difference on which to weigh the merits of two novels, and if the judges were genuinely unable to separate Atwood and Evaristo after several rounds of intense deliberation then a draw was the right outcome. Far better that than one judge saying \u2018sod it, let\u2019s just give it to Evaristo to get this thing over and done with so we can all go and get pissed\u2019 or everyone \u2013 as has been rumoured in the past \u2013 settling on a compromise book that no one really liked as much as the two on which they were deadlocked. A draw may not have provided the headlines people wanted but it did have integrity. I also can\u2019t help feeling it was within the finest traditions of the Booker prize itself. For more than 30 years between 1973 and 2006, Martyn Goff was responsible for administering the Booker and nothing used to upset him more than if the judges were in total agreement and chose a winner that received the unanimous applause of the critics. Goff loved the prize to generate controversy and relished the attendant publicity because he reckoned it boosted both book sales and the profile of the prize. This year\u2019s judges have done him proud.</p> <p><strong>Wednesday</strong></p> <p>A team of psychologists from Warwick University have trawled through Google \u2013 really \u2013 and concluded that people in the UK were at their most unhappy during 1978. More unhappy even than they were during the two world wars. Not for the first time, I find myself completely out of step with the national mood because for me 1978 was one of the happiest years of my life. After a childhood during which I had frequently felt alienated, lost and insecure \u2013 out of step with both myself and my surroundings \u2013 I finally felt as if my life had started when I arrived at Exeter University. After a false start on the French course \u2013 I was genuinely amazed to find I was expected to read books in the language rather than in translation \u2013 I had taken a year out and swapped departments to enrol on the politics course in 1976. Two years later I was living what I felt was my best life in a cottage with no heating and slime trails up the bathroom and kitchen walls for a rent of \u00a35 per week and doing just enough work to get by. The three-day week suited me just fine \u2013 though two and a half days might have been more convenient, the rubbish piling up in the streets was nothing compared to the state of my bedroom, my tuition fees were paid by the government and I even got a grant for living expenses. Best of all, I had made friends who shared my values. We could be simultaneously lost and found together. Of course, my life fell apart soon after as my mental health deteriorated and my drug use progressed into full-on addiction but just in those moments I had a glimpse of what might be possible. Those two years of 1977 and 78 were both the beginning and the end of my age of innocence.</p> <p><strong>Thursday</strong></p> <p>In the past it was weddings, but now it seems that large family gatherings take place at funerals. Today we all met up for the thanksgiving service of my cousin Simon, who died of a heart attack in the summer at the age of 64. Far too young. My lasting memory of Simon was of a holiday in Ireland with my parents, when I was about 14, when he sneaked me off to a pub to teach me how to drink insensibly. In hindsight, that probably wasn\u2019t the best lesson for him to have taught me, but at the time I was immensely grateful for the introduction to unconsciousness. Then, he always was a far better and wiser drinker than me. As a general rule of thumb, the younger you die the better the turnout for a funeral \u2013 the dream is to die at the age of 98 with no one at the crematorium apart from a couple of stragglers who have turned up for the wrong person \u2013 but, even so, I was amazed at how many people had come to see Simon off. There was a crowd of hundreds and the church was packed. I wasn\u2019t the only one to observe that I\u2019d have to pay to get that many for my funeral. It was a tribute to just how well loved and respected he was. The service was both joyous and heartbreaking, with some lovely tributes from his children and family. One theme resonated throughout. That Simon was a man of immense fun and dependability, who never had a bad word to say about anyone. At which my sister nudged me and said: \u201cWe won\u2019t be able to say that about you.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Friday</strong></p> <p>The one upside to parliament sitting on a Saturday for the first time since the Falklands war is that I get to miss Spurs vs Watford. Even if we should surprise ourselves with a win against the bottom club in the Premier league, I suspect I am still protecting myself from a world of pain. There will be pain of a different sort in the Commons though, where Boris Johnson will be hoping to win the vote on his new Brexit deal. He is certain to have to do so without the help of the DUP after he in effect created a border in the Irish sea less than a year after telling their party conference that was the one thing no Conservative prime minister could ever agree to do. The Northern Ireland temporary backstop has been replaced by a permanent full stop. Even so, my hunch is that Johnson will narrowly get his deal over the line. The ERG\u2019s previously unwavering support for the DUP will evaporate as they eye up deregulated free trade deals for England rather than the whole of the UK: amazingly it doesn\u2019t seem to have occurred to them that Johnson will sell them out in a year\u2019s time just as he sold out the DUP.

      "bodyText": "Monday This was the fourth Queen\u2019s speech that I have attended, but the first at which there have been plenty of empty seats on the Lords\u2019 benches. As is customary, the press were in the gallery an hour or so before kick-off and I assumed the gaps on the Tory benches would fill up closer to the start. But there was one pocket of about 12 places that remained stubbornly unfilled, apart from a top hat that had been left in situ as if to reserve a space. But the hat never did get claimed and it could still be there now for all I know. This was also the first time I had seen the Queen look quite so frail and furious. Having already been embarrassed by Boris Johnson over the unlawful first prorogation, she now found herself being used as a frontwoman to launch the Tory party\u2019s manifesto campaign as none of the measures brought forward have a hope of being delivered in the current parliament which is likely to last a matter of months at most. Rumour had it that trust between Buckingham Palace and Downing Street was so low that the Queen had demanded a copy of the speech five days in advance to make sure Johnson did not get the opportunity to sneak in anything untoward at the last minute. Throughout the 15-minute speech Her Majesty made sure her voice maintained a passive aggressive disgust, never once betraying a hint of enthusiasm for anything she was saying. I half expected her to end by ad-libbing that \u201cmy government will abolish the monarchy forthwith\u201d. Just to save herself from going though the whole thing again within months. Tuesday The Booker prize was shared between Bernardine Evaristo\u2019s Girl, Woman, Other and Margaret Atwood\u2019s The Testaments, and many literary critics were outraged that the judges had been unable to decide on a single winner. Inevitably some muttered that Atwood was being rewarded with a long-service medal and Evaristo should have been given the nod, but both winners took the decision far more graciously than those who were angry on their behalf. But it struck me as an entirely reasonable decision by the judges, even if it was one that broke the rules of the competition that had been established to prevent a repeat of 1992 when Michael Ondaatje and Barry Unsworth had shared the prize. Literary prizes have always been a matter of judgment. There is no VAR or goal difference on which to weigh the merits of two novels, and if the judges were genuinely unable to separate Atwood and Evaristo after several rounds of intense deliberation then a draw was the right outcome. Far better that than one judge saying \u2018sod it, let\u2019s just give it to Evaristo to get this thing over and done with so we can all go and get pissed\u2019 or everyone \u2013 as has been rumoured in the past \u2013 settling on a compromise book that no one really liked as much as the two on which they were deadlocked. A draw may not have provided the headlines people wanted but it did have integrity. I also can\u2019t help feeling it was within the finest traditions of the Booker prize itself. For more than 30 years between 1973 and 2006, Martyn Goff was responsible for administering the Booker and nothing used to upset him more than if the judges were in total agreement and chose a winner that received the unanimous applause of the critics. Goff loved the prize to generate controversy and relished the attendant publicity because he reckoned it boosted both book sales and the profile of the prize. This year\u2019s judges have done him proud. Wednesday A team of psychologists from Warwick University have trawled through Google \u2013 really \u2013 and concluded that people in the UK were at their most unhappy during 1978. More unhappy even than they were during the two world wars. Not for the first time, I find myself completely out of step with the national mood because for me 1978 was one of the happiest years of my life. After a childhood during which I had frequently felt alienated, lost and insecure \u2013 out of step with both myself and my surroundings \u2013 I finally felt as if my life had started when I arrived at Exeter University. After a false start on the French course \u2013 I was genuinely amazed to find I was expected to read books in the language rather than in translation \u2013 I had taken a year out and swapped departments to enrol on the politics course in 1976. Two years later I was living what I felt was my best life in a cottage with no heating and slime trails up the bathroom and kitchen walls for a rent of \u00a35 per week and doing just enough work to get by. The three-day week suited me just fine \u2013 though two and a half days might have been more convenient, the rubbish piling up in the streets was nothing compared to the state of my bedroom, my tuition fees were paid by the government and I even got a grant for living expenses. Best of all, I had made friends who shared my values. We could be simultaneously lost and found together. Of course, my life fell apart soon after as my mental health deteriorated and my drug use progressed into full-on addiction but just in those moments I had a glimpse of what might be possible. Those two years of 1977 and 78 were both the beginning and the end of my age of innocence. Thursday In the past it was weddings, but now it seems that large family gatherings take place at funerals. Today we all met up for the thanksgiving service of my cousin Simon, who died of a heart attack in the summer at the age of 64. Far too young. My lasting memory of Simon was of a holiday in Ireland with my parents, when I was about 14, when he sneaked me off to a pub to teach me how to drink insensibly. In hindsight, that probably wasn\u2019t the best lesson for him to have taught me, but at the time I was immensely grateful for the introduction to unconsciousness. Then, he always was a far better and wiser drinker than me. As a general rule of thumb, the younger you die the better the turnout for a funeral \u2013 the dream is to die at the age of 98 with no one at the crematorium apart from a couple of stragglers who have turned up for the wrong person \u2013 but, even so, I was amazed at how many people had come to see Simon off. There was a crowd of hundreds and the church was packed. I wasn\u2019t the only one to observe that I\u2019d have to pay to get that many for my funeral. It was a tribute to just how well loved and respected he was. The service was both joyous and heartbreaking, with some lovely tributes from his children and family. One theme resonated throughout. That Simon was a man of immense fun and dependability, who never had a bad word to say about anyone. At which my sister nudged me and said: \u201cWe won\u2019t be able to say that about you.\u201d Friday The one upside to parliament sitting on a Saturday for the first time since the Falklands war is that I get to miss Spurs vs Watford. Even if we should surprise ourselves with a win against the bottom club in the Premier league, I suspect I am still protecting myself from a world of pain. There will be pain of a different sort in the Commons though, where Boris Johnson will be hoping to win the vote on his new Brexit deal. He is certain to have to do so without the help of the DUP after he in effect created a border in the Irish sea less than a year after telling their party conference that was the one thing no Conservative prime minister could ever agree to do. The Northern Ireland temporary backstop has been replaced by a permanent full stop. Even so, my hunch is that Johnson will narrowly get his deal over the line. The ERG\u2019s previously unwavering support for the DUP will evaporate as they eye up deregulated free trade deals for England rather than the whole of the UK: amazingly it doesn\u2019t seem to have occurred to them that Johnson will sell them out in a year\u2019s time just as he sold out the DUP. But it will be Labour MPs with constituencies that voted leave who will see Johnson home. Though they are unlikely to be thanked for it as they will still probably lose their seats in the general election that will come in the next six months at which the Conservatives will probably romp home. Apart from the disastrous consequences for the country \u2013 6% loss in earnings everyone \u2013 what really sticks in the throat is that a prime minister clearly unsuited to office, and who has made a career of serial dishonesty, will be allowed to rewrite his own history as a statesman and leader of Churchillian brilliance. Or rather it will be rewritten for him by Charles Moore, who will push himself forward to pen a three-volume triumphalist biography.

      "body": "<p>Some families have a wealth of handed-down recipes, carefully written into notebooks with welcome splatters and curling corners. My family does not. My dad is one of 12 brothers and sisters, so my nan (or, \u201cmam\u201d) didn\u2019t have time to go to the corner shop, let alone write down a recipe.</p> <p>On my mum\u2019s Irish, Catholic side, there was just my grandma, and while she and my mum both loved food, their life in a bedsit on a budget meant neither of them were keen cooks. So my food inheritance was simple Sunday roasts, egg and chips, and the odd treat: chocolate bars, fruit pies and \u2013 the favourite \u2013 Welsh cakes. </p> <p>Another treat was always a slice of fruit cake, which even as a kid I loved. This bara brith comes from my husband\u2019s mum, Sian, but I\u2019ve taken a few liberties with the recipes to update them with flavours I now love. Recipes to me are like a food tapestry, with new threads being added as the old ones fray.</p> <h2><strong>Sour cherry and vanilla Welsh cakes (above)</strong></h2> <p>Traditionally, these are made with raisins and a little bit of nutmeg. You could stick to these flavours if you like, but I love them with a hit of citrus, sour cherries and vanilla. They are best eaten warm, and can be heated for a couple of minutes in an oven, pan or even in the toaster.</p> <p>Prep<strong> 20 min</strong><br>Cook <strong>25 min</strong><br>Makes <strong>around 20</strong></p> <p><strong>350g plain flour</strong><br><strong>2 tsp baking powder</strong><br><strong>175g unsalted butter or dairy-free spread</strong><br><strong>Sea salt</strong><br><strong>115g golden caster sugar</strong>, plus extra for dusting<br><strong>100g sour cherries</strong><br><strong>1 vanilla pod</strong>, seeds scraped out, or 1 tsp vanilla bean paste<br><strong>Zest of 1 unwaxed lemon</strong><br><strong>Zest of 1 unwaxed lime</strong><br><strong>1 egg</strong>, beaten<br><strong>2-3 tbsp milk</strong></p> <p>Sift the flour and baking powder into a bowl. Use your fingertips to rub in the butter or dairy-free spread until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs, then mix in the salt, sugar, sour cherries, vanilla and citrus zests. Mix in the beaten egg and two tablespoons of the milk, then bring together with your hands to form a firm dough. If it seems a bit dry, add another tablespoon of milk.</p> <p>Lightly flour a clean work surface and roll out the dough to about 1cm thick. Use a 6cm round cutter to stamp out circles, bringing the dough back together and recutting until it has all been used up.</p> <p>Heat a large, heavy frying pan or flat griddle over a low heat (no need to add any oil) and cook the Welsh cakes five at a time. This should give you plenty of room to flip them over and will ensure they cook evenly. Cook for about two to three minutes each side, until deep golden.</p> <p>Cool the cakes on a wire rack, and dust with caster sugar and a little salt. Eat warm on the day you make them, either on their own or with butter and jam.</p> <h2><strong>Bara brith</strong></h2> <p><em>Bara brith</em> translates from Welsh as \u201cspeckled bread\u201d, which I find adorable. I use Earl Grey in this recipe, because that\u2019s the tea I like to drink, but you can use whatever black tea you like.

      "bodyText": "Some families have a wealth of handed-down recipes, carefully written into notebooks with welcome splatters and curling corners. My family does not. My dad is one of 12 brothers and sisters, so my nan (or, \u201cmam\u201d) didn\u2019t have time to go to the corner shop, let alone write down a recipe. On my mum\u2019s Irish, Catholic side, there was just my grandma, and while she and my mum both loved food, their life in a bedsit on a budget meant neither of them were keen cooks. So my food inheritance was simple Sunday roasts, egg and chips, and the odd treat: chocolate bars, fruit pies and \u2013 the favourite \u2013 Welsh cakes. Another treat was always a slice of fruit cake, which even as a kid I loved. This bara brith comes from my husband\u2019s mum, Sian, but I\u2019ve taken a few liberties with the recipes to update them with flavours I now love. Recipes to me are like a food tapestry, with new threads being added as the old ones fray. Sour cherry and vanilla Welsh cakes (above) Traditionally, these are made with raisins and a little bit of nutmeg. You could stick to these flavours if you like, but I love them with a hit of citrus, sour cherries and vanilla. They are best eaten warm, and can be heated for a couple of minutes in an oven, pan or even in the toaster. Prep 20 min Cook 25 min Makes around 20 350g plain flour 2 tsp baking powder 175g unsalted butter or dairy-free spread Sea salt 115g golden caster sugar, plus extra for dusting 100g sour cherries 1 vanilla pod, seeds scraped out, or 1 tsp vanilla bean paste Zest of 1 unwaxed lemon Zest of 1 unwaxed lime 1 egg, beaten 2-3 tbsp milk Sift the flour and baking powder into a bowl. Use your fingertips to rub in the butter or dairy-free spread until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs, then mix in the salt, sugar, sour cherries, vanilla and citrus zests. Mix in the beaten egg and two tablespoons of the milk, then bring together with your hands to form a firm dough. If it seems a bit dry, add another tablespoon of milk. Lightly flour a clean work surface and roll out the dough to about 1cm thick. Use a 6cm round cutter to stamp out circles, bringing the dough back together and recutting until it has all been used up. Heat a large, heavy frying pan or flat griddle over a low heat (no need to add any oil) and cook the Welsh cakes five at a time. This should give you plenty of room to flip them over and will ensure they cook evenly. Cook for about two to three minutes each side, until deep golden. Cool the cakes on a wire rack, and dust with caster sugar and a little salt. Eat warm on the day you make them, either on their own or with butter and jam. Bara brith Bara brith translates from Welsh as \u201cspeckled bread\u201d, which I find adorable. I use Earl Grey in this recipe, because that\u2019s the tea I like to drink, but you can use whatever black tea you like. If you\u2019re using a less strong tea, such as Earl Grey, brew it using two teabags. Traditionally, raisins, currants and sultanas are used in bara brith, but I like to mix in dates, dried apricots and sour cherries, too. Basically, a mixture of whatever I have. Prep 20 min Soak 1 hr Cook 1 hr 30 min Makes 1 x 2lb/900glarge loaf 250ml strong, hot tea (I use Earl Grey) 450g dried fruit (sultanas, currants, raisins, chopped dates, chopped apricots) 1 organic egg, beaten Zest of 1 unwaxed lemon 200g dark brown sugar 1 tsp baking powder 200g plain wholemeal flour Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/ gas 4. Make your tea nice and strong, and let it brew for a few minutes longer than you would a cup of tea. Put the dried fruit in a large bowl, pour over the tea and leave it to soak for at least an hour \u2013 you can leave it overnight, if you like, but I find an hour is long enough. Mix the egg into the soaked fruit (reserving any remaining soaking liquid for later) and add the lemon zest: if you have soaked the fruit overnight, the liquid should be soaked up, so just add the zest. Mix the sugar, baking powder and flour in a bowl with a whisk to break up any clumps, then mix this into the fruit and eggs. If you haven\u2019t soaked the fruit overnight, add two tablespoons of the reserved liquid and stir through. Grease a 2lb/900g loaf tin and pour in the mix. Bake for 90 minutes: it\u2019s ready when a skewer inserted comes out clean. Eat warm with salted butter.",

As a young-ish gay man, I emphatically am. Watching her compete, I feel proud. But also grateful to have been spared whichever gene compels you to snorkel in a bog. \u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

I\u2019d always enjoyed watching football and it\u2019s true I found it easy to understand, to read the game; when a team was successful, I could see why, how they created space. \u2018This player\u2019s going to do this, that player will do that.\u2019 It\u2019s not easy to translate that to the pitch but that vision of how a holding midfielder should play, interpret the game, was something I had from a young age. Fran made it easy for me.\u201d</p> <p>Your parents, too? \u201cWell, my dad was a football fan,\u201d Rodri says, laughing, \u201cbut he\u2019d tell me to keep the ball more, dribble more, shoot more, be a bit greedier. And I\u2019d be like: \u2018Dad, that\u2019s not my role\u2019. He urged me to get forward because the fun part is scoring, but I\u2019d say: \u2018I like doing this; it\u2019s what I\u2019m good at.\u2019 My parents\u2019 role was vital: they kept things in perspective, didn\u2019t let me get wound up or obsessed, and I take that tranquility on to the pitch. The plan was always to study, too.\u201d</p> <p>Right up to the day he made his debut, and beyond. Released by Atl\u00e9tico, Rodri joined Villarreal. He also enrolled at university, reading business in Castell\u00f3n, and moved into a hall of residence. \u201cThe best years of my life so far,\u201d he says. \u201cMy parents suggested going into halls and it was brilliant. There\u2019s a good, happy atmosphere, people your age from all over. I met my girlfriend there. One of the best experiences I\u2019ve had.\u201d</p> <p>The student life, eh? Rodri laughs. \u201cThe best atmosphere in the world! No, no. I\u2019d go for dinner and a drink but obviously not the after-hours stuff. I was the lame guy who never did anything, haha. People didn\u2019t understand; then when I started playing for the [Villarreal] first team they began to. Some didn\u2019t even know, then they\u2019d see me play.\u201d First\u2011team football didn\u2019t mean shelving the books. \u201cIt\u2019s a personal challenge now more than anything, the time invested. I want the pride of finishing. It\u2019s harder because of the distance. I have to go back for exams.</p> <p>\u201cObviously, football takes over, but studying is a healthy distraction. You\u2019re dedicated to football 24 hours, but you need to clear your head occasionally: it\u2019s intense and, particularly at this level, you can\u2019t afford mistakes. If you think continually about a defeat, if you don\u2019t occupy your mind with anything else, you might pay for it. It\u2019s good to be informed too: we live in a bubble, but my best friends are mostly from school and university and it\u2019s good to put yourself in [other people\u2019s] skin. The problem is in football one day you\u2019re here, the next day you\u2019re far away.

The decision to leave Villarreal and join Atl\u00e9tico, a club with a footballing identity seemingly opposed to his was deliberate: he wanted to learn from Diego Simeone, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/09/rodri-manchester-city-sergio-busquets-comparisons\" title=\"\">developing qualities he lacked</a>, and his adaptability was summed up in a stat: the player who completed the most passes became the player who completed the most tackles.

We know the situation we\u2019re in: we\u2019ve had players out, we\u2019ve played a lot of games and maybe that\u2019s taking its toll. He\u2019ll work on what we have to improve. We\u2019re better when we rob the ball in the opposition\u2019s half; when we press, we have to deal better with counters.\u201d</p> <p>That means him, lessons still there to be learned. \u201cWe\u2019re very offensive; we need a player who defends as well as attacks. It\u2019s one of the most important roles in the team; it\u2019s important to control what happens when attacks end, but it\u2019s not just without the ball. If you take the initiative, you\u2019re constantly moving. One of the things I have to improve is having the patience to wait for the right moment against teams that defend deep and we can\u2019t penetrate. And when you lose the ball, you have to leap like mad to get it back so we can keep attacking, keep attacking, keep attacking because this team never stops.\u201d</p> <p>It is some responsibility. \u201cYeah, but that\u2019s my role. It\u2019s why I came.\u201d It\u2019s also who he is.</p>",

We know the situation we\u2019re in: we\u2019ve had players out, we\u2019ve played a lot of games and maybe that\u2019s taking its toll. He\u2019ll work on what we have to improve. We\u2019re better when we rob the ball in the opposition\u2019s half; when we press, we have to deal better with counters.\u201d That means him, lessons still there to be learned. \u201cWe\u2019re very offensive; we need a player who defends as well as attacks. It\u2019s one of the most important roles in the team; it\u2019s important to control what happens when attacks end, but it\u2019s not just without the ball. If you take the initiative, you\u2019re constantly moving. One of the things I have to improve is having the patience to wait for the right moment against teams that defend deep and we can\u2019t penetrate. And when you lose the ball, you have to leap like mad to get it back so we can keep attacking, keep attacking, keep attacking because this team never stops.\u201d It is some responsibility. \u201cYeah, but that\u2019s my role. It\u2019s why I came.\u201d It\u2019s also who he is.",

Fiftysomething widowed mother of two Patience faces a precarious future thanks to a job with no pension \u2013 the French state likes to pay its court interpreters \u201coff the books\u201d \u2013 and a mother with dementia in an expensive care home. Years of translating police wiretaps on north African drug gangs have given her an inside track on the trade in Moroccan hashish, so, when she gets the chance to take possession of a consignment of <em>le bon shit</em>, she puts her fluency in Arabic to criminal use. Acerbic and witty, casting a sharp eye on both failing social systems and the fruitless \u201cwar on drugs\u201d, Patience is one of the standout characters in this year\u2019s crime fiction crop, and you\u2019ll be rooting for her all the way.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5a5612ff47e78b46880e4dff53372d6060e89eb1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a5612ff47e78b46880e4dff53372d6060e89eb1/0_0_326_499/326.jpg\" alt=\"The Choke \" width=\"326\" height=\"499\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Another outstanding creation is Justine Lee, narrator of <strong>The Choke</strong> by Sofie Laguna (Gallic, \u00a38.99). It is the early 1970s in a fictional town on Australia\u2019s Murray River, and the 10-year-old, whose mother abandoned the family years before, lives in a world of men: two older brothers; Ray, her violent criminal father, who visits periodically; and alcoholic grandfather and PTSD sufferer Pop, who attempts to provide stability. Daily life is full of threats, from innuendo to downright menace; unable to read due to undiagnosed dyslexia, Justine has nothing and no one to turn to for information or emotional support. Her brief glimpse of a less brutal life is snatched away when her only schoolfriend moves to Sydney, and there is a horrible, slow-motion-car-crash inevitability about what happens to her three years later. Raw and powerful, <em>The Choke</em> is not an easy read, but Justine\u2019s resilience and strength of character make for an ending that is both redemptive and moving.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"3d758a37200da5d61f4f84206a31a492b769dfb6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d758a37200da5d61f4f84206a31a492b769dfb6/0_0_311_499/311.jpg\" alt=\"This Little Dark Place \" width=\"311\" height=\"499\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Set in a small, depressed town on the Lancashire coast, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/this-little-dark-place-9781788162029.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">AS Hatch\u2019s debut <strong>This Little Dark Place </strong></a>(Serpent\u2019s Tail, \u00a312.99) centres on carpenter Daniel, whose wife Victoria turns away from him after the miscarriage of a longed-for pregnancy.

      "bodyText": "A European prizewinner, The Godmother by Hannelore Cayre (translated by Stephanie Smee, Old Street, \u00a38.99) is Breaking Bad meets Weeds, with a French suburban twist. Fiftysomething widowed mother of two Patience faces a precarious future thanks to a job with no pension \u2013 the French state likes to pay its court interpreters \u201coff the books\u201d \u2013 and a mother with dementia in an expensive care home. Years of translating police wiretaps on north African drug gangs have given her an inside track on the trade in Moroccan hashish, so, when she gets the chance to take possession of a consignment of le bon shit, she puts her fluency in Arabic to criminal use. Acerbic and witty, casting a sharp eye on both failing social systems and the fruitless \u201cwar on drugs\u201d, Patience is one of the standout characters in this year\u2019s crime fiction crop, and you\u2019ll be rooting for her all the way. Another outstanding creation is Justine Lee, narrator of The Choke by Sofie Laguna (Gallic, \u00a38.99). It is the early 1970s in a fictional town on Australia\u2019s Murray River, and the 10-year-old, whose mother abandoned the family years before, lives in a world of men: two older brothers; Ray, her violent criminal father, who visits periodically; and alcoholic grandfather and PTSD sufferer Pop, who attempts to provide stability. Daily life is full of threats, from innuendo to downright menace; unable to read due to undiagnosed dyslexia, Justine has nothing and no one to turn to for information or emotional support. Her brief glimpse of a less brutal life is snatched away when her only schoolfriend moves to Sydney, and there is a horrible, slow-motion-car-crash inevitability about what happens to her three years later. Raw and powerful, The Choke is not an easy read, but Justine\u2019s resilience and strength of character make for an ending that is both redemptive and moving.

So it is a relief that Lights Up \u2013 our first peek at what has been heavily trailed as a daring new Styles-goes-cosmic direction (AKA took mushrooms once) \u2013 actually feels so effortless and laid-back. It is a blissed-out track, never coming down from a higher state of consciousness, that occasionally goes a bit heavy on the phasing effects but otherwise burbles along like deluxe bubble bath.</p> <h2><strong>Halsey </strong><br><strong>Graveyard</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPgaYeq9NvI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rPgaYeq9NvI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>It\u2019s mid-October and you know what that means: time to get S-P-O-O-K-Y. But also S-A-D. That\u2019s the takeaway from Halsey\u2019s latest moody-banger, now with added creepy funfair vid. It\u2019s a poignant, spiralling snapshot of doomed romantic obsession that courts the goth vote (lots of references to loitering in graveyards) but gets severely marked down for the lyric \u201clet that sink in\u201d.

With its ominous roaming bassline and nervy pizzicato strings, standout track Demons is another Halloween anthem-in-waiting, albeit one where the scary monsters are trapped within rather than roaming the streets.

So it is a relief that Lights Up \u2013 our first peek at what has been heavily trailed as a daring new Styles-goes-cosmic direction (AKA took mushrooms once) \u2013 actually feels so effortless and laid-back. It is a blissed-out track, never coming down from a higher state of consciousness, that occasionally goes a bit heavy on the phasing effects but otherwise burbles along like deluxe bubble bath. Halsey Graveyard It\u2019s mid-October and you know what that means: time to get S-P-O-O-K-Y. But also S-A-D. That\u2019s the takeaway from Halsey\u2019s latest moody-banger, now with added creepy funfair vid. It\u2019s a poignant, spiralling snapshot of doomed romantic obsession that courts the goth vote (lots of references to loitering in graveyards) but gets severely marked down for the lyric \u201clet that sink in\u201d. It\u2019s not Twitter, Halz. Hayley Kiyoko Demons Kiyoko\u2019s new ongoing musical project rejoices in the #relatable title I\u2019m Too Sensitive for This Shit.

      "body": "<p>It must have been something of a culture shock for my great-great-grandad when he left Grosmont, a small village in the North York Moors, for industrial south Leeds. He had worked on North Yorkshire\u2019s railways before moving to Hunslet, known as the \u201cworkshop of Leeds\u201d on account of its iron foundries and steelworks. Like neighbouring Holbeck, the centre of Leeds\u2019 textile industry, workers lived in red-brick terraced houses close to their places of employment.</p> <p>By the 1890s Hunslet\u2019s steel works was Britain\u2019s largest producer of railway tracks, sprawling over a 25-acre site. By 1911, one in every five men worked in Leeds\u2019 heavy industries, which were predominantly concentrated south of the River Aire.</p> <p>South Leeds\u2019 reliance on iron, steel and textiles meant it was hit hard by industrial decline. By the 1960s the area\u2019s traditional industries had largely collapsed and workers\u2019 terraces were demolished in slum clearances. Stourton, a working-class suburb bordering Holbeck, was transformed in the space of a few years from residential suburb to post-industrial wasteland. The city council, keen to rebrand Leeds as a thoroughly modern city, welcomed the construction of the M621 motorway through Holbeck and Hunslet, and attempted to style Leeds as the \u201cMotorway City of the Seventies\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3c4532378963012aaddf4c401e2a9eeb28d09075\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c4532378963012aaddf4c401e2a9eeb28d09075/0_0_1600_1383/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hunslet Mill\" width=\"1000\" height=\"864\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Fifty years later, the effects of post-industrial decline and poor urban planning are increasingly difficult to ignore. South Leeds\u2019 grandiose industrial architecture is decaying; far from singing the motorway\u2019s praises, <a href=\"https://democracy.leeds.gov.uk/documents/s167153/Locality%20Working%20Report%20Appendix%205%20061117.pdf\">the council now recognises</a> that the M621 \u201cdisrupts the community, cutting it off from the rest of Leeds\u201d. In 2018 the council launched an ambitious plan to redevelop Leeds\u2019 \u201cSouth Bank\u201d, hoping to redevelop industrial wasteland to double the size of the city centre. Architectural plans show the \u201cSouth Bank\u201d sprinkled with high-rise office buildings, and residents might question whether the benefits will be spread evenly between businesses and the local population. Nonetheless, attention is at last being focused on the future of south Leeds and its unique heritage.</p> <p>A walk through south Leeds reveals a district caught between industrial grandeur, post-industrial wasteland and urban blandness. The starting point is Leeds station, where the 1960s edifice and the 1930s art-deco concourse sit directly above the Dark Arches, a series of vaults spanning the River Aire that serve as the station\u2019s foundation. A metal walkway passes through the Dark Arches and over the Aire, where passers-by can stop andwatch the churning water receding into darkness. Around 18m bricks were used to construct the arches during the 1860s \u2013 the largest such project in the world at that time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"66f3fd65f265cf77d1aa334a82547e2fd9eed738\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66f3fd65f265cf77d1aa334a82547e2fd9eed738/0_0_1067_1600/667.jpg\" alt=\"The Dark Arches illustration.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Through the Dark Arches lies the Leeds-Liverpool canal and the gentrified tip of Holbeck: \u201cHolbeck Urban Village\u201d, a tight knot of former red-brick flax mills and steam engine works. The Round Foundry dates back to 1795 and was once home to steam engine manufacturers; today the complex is home to offices, a brewery and Yorkshire\u2019s official tourist board. The gentrification of this small part of Holbeck has done little to ease poverty in south Leeds as a whole, but it has preserved a part of the district\u2019s history that was previously at risk.</p> <p>The buildings in the Urban Village are significant, but the most impressive relics of south Leeds\u2019 industrial heritage lie just around the corner. Tower Works on Globe Road was constructed in the 1860s by the industrialist Thomas Harding to produce needles for south Leeds\u2019 textile manufacturers. A lover of Italian architecture, Harding took the unusual decision to embellish his factory with red-brick replicas of famous towers in Verona, Florence and San Gimignano. Derelict for several decades, Tower Works is currently being converted into luxury flats.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a719c41dd41f8ee279c0c7bac624250872566734\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a719c41dd41f8ee279c0c7bac624250872566734/0_0_1035_1600/647.jpg\" alt=\"Tower Works illustration.\" width=\"647\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Perhaps the most impressive relic of south Leeds\u2019 industrial past lies a five minute walk from Tower Works. Pass Marshall Mills, an imposing six-storey edifice that dwarfs the smaller industrial buildings around it, and you might be surprised to find an Egyptian temple executed in millstone grit. This is Temple Works, modelled on the Temple of Horus at Edfu on the west bank of the Nile, and a prime example of northern industrialists\u2019 use of architecture to flaunt their cultural capital.</p> <p>Temple Works opened in 1840 and boasted the largest single-span room in the world, as well as a grass-covered roof where sheep could graze, sometimes falling on to the street below. The mill was sold in the 1880s, and by 2008 it was on the verge of collapse. After several stalled attempts at redevelopment, Temple Works has been purchased by a local developer, CEG. Work has started on the restoration, with <a href=\"https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/commercial-property/temple-works-owners-vow-to-make-it-a-building-of-national-importance-1-9662788\">CEG stating</a>: \u201cWe want to reconnect the communities that were cut off by the M621 and feel the city centre is not for them. It needs to be an inclusive use that everyone is proud of.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c99596a844df8a19939b9fee922b424c204a597e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c99596a844df8a19939b9fee922b424c204a597e/0_0_1600_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Temple Works illustration.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Beyond Temple Works the gentrification ends abruptly. South of the regenerated buildings lies a patchwork landscape of old railway viaducts, industrial wasteland and decaying historic buildings such as Low Hall Mills, constructed in 1874 and now derelict. The area is peppered with listed buildings; the red terracotta and Burmantofts tiling of Holbeck public library, now offices; the United Methodist Free Chapel constructed in 1880, now home to a carpet warehouse. Yet much of the landscape is a blur of roundabouts and light industrial units.</p> <p>This part of Holbeck has seen its fair share of controversy: in 2014 the area was profiled in the press as the UK\u2019s first \u201clegal\u201d red light district, a reference to Leeds city council\u2019s introduction of a \u201cmanaged zone\u201d where sex workers and punters could work free of police interference within agreed hours and geographic limits. Although efforts to improve safety for sex workers are commendable, Holbeck\u2019s ginnels and viaducts are far from a sanctuary. In 2016 a young woman named Daria Pionko was murdered by a punter in the managed zone, <a href=\"https://manquemagazine.com/2019/09/11/a-fragile-sanctuary-englands-legal-red-light-district/\">a reminder of the dangers that women working in Holbeck still face.</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"eaed0d09a50c3ffc3dc0b4e6baf0742343319850\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eaed0d09a50c3ffc3dc0b4e6baf0742343319850/0_0_512_384/500.jpg\" alt=\"Holbeck illustration.\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In neighbouring Hunslet, the remnants of south Leeds\u2019 industrial past are harder to spot. Clues remain, however: among the most impressive examples of Hunslet\u2019s industrial past are Leeds city college\u2019s conversion of a former printworks factory into a campus, resplendent in terracotta, and the former Hunslet Engine Company headquarters on Jack Lane, where an exposed section of rail track still cuts through the road (the Hunslet Engine Company is still manufacturing locomotive engines in south Leeds to this day).</p> <p>Just over the border in Middleton lies the oldest continuously operating railway in the world, Middleton Railway, opened in 1758 to serve south Leeds\u2019 coal mines. There are other reasons to be optimistic: Victoria Mills, derelict since the 1970s and once among the Victorian Society\u2019s top 10 at-risk buildings, is being redeveloped as flats. It is not clear how many will be affordable, but at the very least part of Hunslet\u2019s industrial history has been salvaged.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a43b832cf15e9cb0cd318c6202c836f1730b577e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a43b832cf15e9cb0cd318c6202c836f1730b577e/0_0_1105_1600/691.jpg\" alt=\"Marshall Mills illustration.\" width=\"691\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>South Leeds was once the heart of industrial Leeds, but suffered a steep decline in the late 20th century. There are reasons to question how far the redevelopment of buildings like Victoria Mills will address stubborn poverty in the area, and there remains a perceived boundary between Holbeck proper and the Urban Village.

      "bodyText": "It must have been something of a culture shock for my great-great-grandad when he left Grosmont, a small village in the North York Moors, for industrial south Leeds. He had worked on North Yorkshire\u2019s railways before moving to Hunslet, known as the \u201cworkshop of Leeds\u201d on account of its iron foundries and steelworks. Like neighbouring Holbeck, the centre of Leeds\u2019 textile industry, workers lived in red-brick terraced houses close to their places of employment. By the 1890s Hunslet\u2019s steel works was Britain\u2019s largest producer of railway tracks, sprawling over a 25-acre site. By 1911, one in every five men worked in Leeds\u2019 heavy industries, which were predominantly concentrated south of the River Aire. South Leeds\u2019 reliance on iron, steel and textiles meant it was hit hard by industrial decline. By the 1960s the area\u2019s traditional industries had largely collapsed and workers\u2019 terraces were demolished in slum clearances. Stourton, a working-class suburb bordering Holbeck, was transformed in the space of a few years from residential suburb to post-industrial wasteland. The city council, keen to rebrand Leeds as a thoroughly modern city, welcomed the construction of the M621 motorway through Holbeck and Hunslet, and attempted to style Leeds as the \u201cMotorway City of the Seventies\u201d. Fifty years later, the effects of post-industrial decline and poor urban planning are increasingly difficult to ignore. South Leeds\u2019 grandiose industrial architecture is decaying; far from singing the motorway\u2019s praises, the council now recognises that the M621 \u201cdisrupts the community, cutting it off from the rest of Leeds\u201d. In 2018 the council launched an ambitious plan to redevelop Leeds\u2019 \u201cSouth Bank\u201d, hoping to redevelop industrial wasteland to double the size of the city centre. Architectural plans show the \u201cSouth Bank\u201d sprinkled with high-rise office buildings, and residents might question whether the benefits will be spread evenly between businesses and the local population. Nonetheless, attention is at last being focused on the future of south Leeds and its unique heritage. A walk through south Leeds reveals a district caught between industrial grandeur, post-industrial wasteland and urban blandness. The starting point is Leeds station, where the 1960s edifice and the 1930s art-deco concourse sit directly above the Dark Arches, a series of vaults spanning the River Aire that serve as the station\u2019s foundation. A metal walkway passes through the Dark Arches and over the Aire, where passers-by can stop andwatch the churning water receding into darkness. Around 18m bricks were used to construct the arches during the 1860s \u2013 the largest such project in the world at that time. Through the Dark Arches lies the Leeds-Liverpool canal and the gentrified tip of Holbeck: \u201cHolbeck Urban Village\u201d, a tight knot of former red-brick flax mills and steam engine works. The Round Foundry dates back to 1795 and was once home to steam engine manufacturers; today the complex is home to offices, a brewery and Yorkshire\u2019s official tourist board. The gentrification of this small part of Holbeck has done little to ease poverty in south Leeds as a whole, but it has preserved a part of the district\u2019s history that was previously at risk. The buildings in the Urban Village are significant, but the most impressive relics of south Leeds\u2019 industrial heritage lie just around the corner. Tower Works on Globe Road was constructed in the 1860s by the industrialist Thomas Harding to produce needles for south Leeds\u2019 textile manufacturers. A lover of Italian architecture, Harding took the unusual decision to embellish his factory with red-brick replicas of famous towers in Verona, Florence and San Gimignano. Derelict for several decades, Tower Works is currently being converted into luxury flats. Perhaps the most impressive relic of south Leeds\u2019 industrial past lies a five minute walk from Tower Works. Pass Marshall Mills, an imposing six-storey edifice that dwarfs the smaller industrial buildings around it, and you might be surprised to find an Egyptian temple executed in millstone grit. This is Temple Works, modelled on the Temple of Horus at Edfu on the west bank of the Nile, and a prime example of northern industrialists\u2019 use of architecture to flaunt their cultural capital. Temple Works opened in 1840 and boasted the largest single-span room in the world, as well as a grass-covered roof where sheep could graze, sometimes falling on to the street below. The mill was sold in the 1880s, and by 2008 it was on the verge of collapse. After several stalled attempts at redevelopment, Temple Works has been purchased by a local developer, CEG. Work has started on the restoration, with CEG stating: \u201cWe want to reconnect the communities that were cut off by the M621 and feel the city centre is not for them. It needs to be an inclusive use that everyone is proud of.\u201d Beyond Temple Works the gentrification ends abruptly. South of the regenerated buildings lies a patchwork landscape of old railway viaducts, industrial wasteland and decaying historic buildings such as Low Hall Mills, constructed in 1874 and now derelict. The area is peppered with listed buildings; the red terracotta and Burmantofts tiling of Holbeck public library, now offices; the United Methodist Free Chapel constructed in 1880, now home to a carpet warehouse. Yet much of the landscape is a blur of roundabouts and light industrial units. This part of Holbeck has seen its fair share of controversy: in 2014 the area was profiled in the press as the UK\u2019s first \u201clegal\u201d red light district, a reference to Leeds city council\u2019s introduction of a \u201cmanaged zone\u201d where sex workers and punters could work free of police interference within agreed hours and geographic limits. Although efforts to improve safety for sex workers are commendable, Holbeck\u2019s ginnels and viaducts are far from a sanctuary. In 2016 a young woman named Daria Pionko was murdered by a punter in the managed zone, a reminder of the dangers that women working in Holbeck still face. In neighbouring Hunslet, the remnants of south Leeds\u2019 industrial past are harder to spot. Clues remain, however: among the most impressive examples of Hunslet\u2019s industrial past are Leeds city college\u2019s conversion of a former printworks factory into a campus, resplendent in terracotta, and the former Hunslet Engine Company headquarters on Jack Lane, where an exposed section of rail track still cuts through the road (the Hunslet Engine Company is still manufacturing locomotive engines in south Leeds to this day). Just over the border in Middleton lies the oldest continuously operating railway in the world, Middleton Railway, opened in 1758 to serve south Leeds\u2019 coal mines. There are other reasons to be optimistic: Victoria Mills, derelict since the 1970s and once among the Victorian Society\u2019s top 10 at-risk buildings, is being redeveloped as flats. It is not clear how many will be affordable, but at the very least part of Hunslet\u2019s industrial history has been salvaged. South Leeds was once the heart of industrial Leeds, but suffered a steep decline in the late 20th century. There are reasons to question how far the redevelopment of buildings like Victoria Mills will address stubborn poverty in the area, and there remains a perceived boundary between Holbeck proper and the Urban Village. Nonetheless, after decades of neglect, there are signs that south Leeds and its remarkable history is finally being recognised. Francesca Roe is a writer, printmaker and illustrator from Leeds.

Here is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/publications/revised-withdrawal-agreement-including-protocol-ireland-and-northern-ireland_en\">link to the full text</a>.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>The backstop is replaced</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The backstop has essentially been replaced by a full stop whereby Northern Ireland remains aligned to the EU from the end of the transition period for at least four years. A change can only happen if it is voted on by the Stormont assembly.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Consent</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Stormont will have a key role in future Brexit arrangements. And if there is cross-community support to remain aligned to the EU rather than the UK the consent will hold for eight years.</p>\n    <p>The arrangements in this deal will automatically kick in for a mandated four years if there is a breakdown in trade talks, so it remains a \u201cbackstop\u201d but with a permanent tinge.</p>\n    <p>That four-year period will start at the end of December 2020.</p>\n    <p>Two months before the end of the four-year period, that is October 2024, Stormont will be asked to vote on whether to remain aligned to the EU in ways outlined by this deal or not.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Checks on border, ports and airports</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Under the deal, the UK and the EU are \u201cunderlining their firm commitment to no customs and regulatory checks or controls and related physical infrastructure at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland\u201d.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Future trade deals</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The EU and the UK will aim for a zero-tariff deal with unlimited quotas. The entire UK, including Northern Ireland, will be free to sign trade deals. The line in the political declaration that \u201cthe United Kingdom will consider aligning with union rules in relevant areas\u201d in any future trade talks has been ditched.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Customs</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Northern Ireland will remain legally in the UK customs territory but practically in the EU customs unions. There will therefore be no customs checks on the border but tariffs will be payable on certain commercial goods.</p>\n    <p>No customs duties will be payable on \u201cpersonal property\u201d being transited from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. That protects online shopping and all items bought for personal rather than commercial use.</p>\n    <p>Customs duties will be payable on goods imported from the UK for commercial use unless it can be demonstrated that the goods remain in Northern Ireland or are for personal use, as above.</p>\n    <p>A system of rebates will allow importers to be reimbursed.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>West/east trade</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The commitment to frictionless trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain is restated.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>VAT</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>EU law on VAT will apply in Northern Ireland.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Single electricity market</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The island of Ireland is considering a single market for electricity so homes in Northern Ireland can get their energy from a supplier in Northern Ireland or the republic. There were fears this could be disrupted by Brexit. Under the Johnson deal, the provisions of union law remain so nothing will change.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Level playing field</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This guarantees that the UK will remain in line with EU conventions on climate, environment and workers rights in a future trade agreement.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lisaocarroll\"><b>Lisa O'Carroll</b></a>&nbsp;<i>Brexit correspondent</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>During a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/17/boris-johnson-gets-deal-backslapping-brussels-eu-summit-brexit\">25-minute meeting</a> with EU leaders, Johnson expressed confidence he could get a majority for his Brexit deal in a rare Saturday sitting of the Commons.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6a0b50e8-3b91-455a-b54c-c5ee903cea00\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-Y7gmLkrYq4?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Thanking the EU for the deal, the prime minister made a short, upbeat statement in which he referred to his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/21/boris-johnson-route-to-number-10\">school days in Brussels</a>.

During a discussion on Thursday, the German chancellor told EU leaders that a Brexit extension would be unavoidable if British MPs vote down the new deal. She advised her fellow heads of state and government they could not pretend an extension would not be offered to the UK if it was requested, according to a source familiar with the discussions. Merkel framed Brexit as a historic issue weighing on the EU and said leaders had a responsibility not to push the UK out without a deal if there was a request for further delay. The intervention by Macron and Juncker, who sought to \u201crule out\u201d an extension as he arrived at the summit on Thursday, expose the desire among the EU27 to move the Brexit talks on after two arduous years of negotiation. In his press conference on Friday, Macron went on to say that Johnson had started out with unacceptable proposals but had then \u201cgot into the complexity\u201d of the issue.

While EU leaders are anxious for the Brexit deal to pass, they do not wish to be drawn into the vortex of British politics.

Thanking the EU for the deal, the prime minister made a short, upbeat statement in which he referred to his school days in Brussels. Johnson attended the European school in Uccle, which educates the children of EU officials.

It said in a statement issued in New York that it was \u201cdeeply alarmed to hear of the family being held in inhumane conditions on a farmhouse in the Netherlands\u201d.</p> <p>It said it could confirm that Van Dorsten \u201cwas briefly a member of our movement in the mid-1980s\u201d but had left in 1987. He was \u201cknown to have mental health issues\u201d and his brother had not heard from him for over 30 years, it said, adding that there were no records indicating Brunner had ever been associated with the movement.</p> <p>A local TV station, RTV Drenthe, had earlier reported that the Austrian was a member of the church, which was where the two men had met. <a href=\"https://www.rtvdrenthe.nl/nieuws/153127/Boerderijgezin-Ruinerwold-volgelingen-van-Moonsekte\">The broadcaster also reported</a> that the siblings had been moved from a holiday park where they were taken after other guests had seen them performing cult rituals, such as walking in circles.</p> <p>Three people who say they are also Van Dorsten\u2019s children have come forward to say they left the family eight years ago and had heard no news of the others since. Neighbours told Dutch media they had assumed he had moved to South Korea, where the movement was founded, or died. He did not attend his mother\u2019s funeral, one said.</p> <p>Willem Koetsier, a church member in Amsterdam, told the Algemeen Dagblad newspaper that after van Dorsten had left the movement he had gone to Germany where \u201cwe lost sight of him\u201d. He said he believed the father \u201ctogether with someone else\u201d had since started their own cult.</p> <p>Van Dorsten was was active in the movement in Germany and Austria and later married an Austrian woman, <a href=\"https://www.ad.nl/binnenland/ruinerwold-vader-gerrit-jan-jarenlang-gezocht-door-familie-buren-dachten-dat-hij-dood-was~a4c5377f/\">Koetsier told the paper</a>. \u201cI have heard from older members that he was a very spiritual person and set up a group with his family,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes people who are spiritual start their own church or movement. I think this is the case with him. It could be that he thought he had a special mission.\u201d</p> <p>Brunner\u2019s brother said separately that the Austrian had previously been in a cult after leaving military service, although he did not say which group. \u201cHe was in a sect,\u201d the brother told the Kronen Zeitung newspaper. \u201cWe\u2019ve had no contact with him for 10 years.

The tenant of the farmhouse, a 58-year-old Austrian man identified by the church as Josef Brunner, appeared before an examining magistrate on Thursday on similar charges and was ordered to be detained for two weeks. \u201cWe are dealing with an exceptional situation,\u201d the police statement said. The Universal Peace Federation, as the church now calls itself, was founded in 1954 and is famed for its mass weddings. It said in a statement issued in New York that it was \u201cdeeply alarmed to hear of the family being held in inhumane conditions on a farmhouse in the Netherlands\u201d. It said it could confirm that Van Dorsten \u201cwas briefly a member of our movement in the mid-1980s\u201d but had left in 1987. He was \u201cknown to have mental health issues\u201d and his brother had not heard from him for over 30 years, it said, adding that there were no records indicating Brunner had ever been associated with the movement. A local TV station, RTV Drenthe, had earlier reported that the Austrian was a member of the church, which was where the two men had met. The broadcaster also reported that the siblings had been moved from a holiday park where they were taken after other guests had seen them performing cult rituals, such as walking in circles. Three people who say they are also Van Dorsten\u2019s children have come forward to say they left the family eight years ago and had heard no news of the others since. Neighbours told Dutch media they had assumed he had moved to South Korea, where the movement was founded, or died. He did not attend his mother\u2019s funeral, one said. Willem Koetsier, a church member in Amsterdam, told the Algemeen Dagblad newspaper that after van Dorsten had left the movement he had gone to Germany where \u201cwe lost sight of him\u201d. He said he believed the father \u201ctogether with someone else\u201d had since started their own cult. Van Dorsten was was active in the movement in Germany and Austria and later married an Austrian woman, Koetsier told the paper. \u201cI have heard from older members that he was a very spiritual person and set up a group with his family,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes people who are spiritual start their own church or movement. I think this is the case with him. It could be that he thought he had a special mission.\u201d Brunner\u2019s brother said separately that the Austrian had previously been in a cult after leaving military service, although he did not say which group. \u201cHe was in a sect,\u201d the brother told the Kronen Zeitung newspaper. \u201cWe\u2019ve had no contact with him for 10 years. I told him to get lost when he wanted me to become his financial guarantor.\u201d",

Having grown up around Scousers, never knowingly out of six-foot range of a prayer card, a devotional portrait, or just a plan to go somewhere to worship someone, I find this saint-chasing shtick rather comforting. Especially if it involves Cantabrian boquerones, peralzola cheese, allioli, sofrito, live fire hearths and a lot of cold, white, organic <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xarel%C2%B7lo\" title=\"\">xarel\u00b7lo</a>.</p> <p>Pilgrim lives on the upper deck of <a href=\"https://www.dukestreetmarket.com/#kitchens\" title=\"\">Duke Street Market</a>, which is what we\u2019re loosely calling right now in restaurant-land \u201ca food hall\u201d, although that\u2019s a catch-all term that doesn\u2019t really work, because the hospitality at each different venue works in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/aug/30/grace-dent-arcade-food-theatre-review-london\" title=\"\">slightly different way</a>. For me, 2019 has been a year of loitering confusedly in food halls, gob ajar, trying to decipher where one eats, sits, orders and pays. Duke Street Market is the first set-up with the stark gumption to put an effusive staff member at the front door chivvying the customers for Asian bowl-food kitchen <a href=\"https://www.dukestreetmarket.com/trader/ginger/\" title=\"\">Ginger</a> or vegan counter <a href=\"https://www.dukestreetmarket.com/trader/indigo-greens/\" title=\"\">Indigo Greens</a> over to the communal benches, while directing Pilgrims like me to the more formal restaurant up a flight of stairs, where a mezzanine overlooks the fun.</p> <p>Because Duke Street Market is definitely fun. Noisy fun. This is a 19th-century warehouse with exposed brick walls and a thunderous sound system.

A plate of fresh, green, defiantly al dente runner beans arrived on a puddle of the deepest, oiliest, most garlicky sofrito strewn with small, piquant, smoked cherry tomatoes. Green beans on red sauce shouldn\u2019t taste that good. Sure, I\u2019d have cooked the beans longer. Same, too for chargrilled leeks. I can only guess that the chef came from a family like mine, where Christmas sprouts were put on to simmer some time in late November, and has spent a culinary journey rebelling. We demolished the leeks nevertheless as they arrived, slathered in light-blue-veined cow\u2019s cheese, scattered with delicately candied walnut.</p> <p>I can\u2019t pretend the food at Pilgrim was perfect; a piece of monkfish tail in a vivid orange pimiento glaze was overcooked and slightly bizarre-tasting. But then a <em><a href=\"https://www.bascofinefoods.com/spanish-recipes/basque-txuleton-recipe/\">txuleton</a></em> sirloin, served \u2013 no ifs or buts \u2013 rare, was a huge success on our table, arriving with a pond-green Castilian salsa heaving with thickly sliced melting onions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e1fd1b72efe137de76a1e11bcb48d240392b7d4f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1fd1b72efe137de76a1e11bcb48d240392b7d4f/0_0_5491_3661/1000.jpg\" alt=\"St.James tart, Pilgrim Liverpool.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pilgrim\u2019s St James tart: \u2018One of the greatest things I\u2019ve tasted this year.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaw &amp; Shaw/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pilgrim is a restaurant I want to return to again and again out of sheer curiosity.

OK, it\u2019s a Spanish restaurant. And some of the stuff is on small plates, so you could even say it\u2019s tapas, but I like Pilgrim\u2019s swagger. Having grown up around Scousers, never knowingly out of six-foot range of a prayer card, a devotional portrait, or just a plan to go somewhere to worship someone, I find this saint-chasing shtick rather comforting. Especially if it involves Cantabrian boquerones, peralzola cheese, allioli, sofrito, live fire hearths and a lot of cold, white, organic xarel\u00b7lo. Pilgrim lives on the upper deck of Duke Street Market, which is what we\u2019re loosely calling right now in restaurant-land \u201ca food hall\u201d, although that\u2019s a catch-all term that doesn\u2019t really work, because the hospitality at each different venue works in a slightly different way. For me, 2019 has been a year of loitering confusedly in food halls, gob ajar, trying to decipher where one eats, sits, orders and pays. Duke Street Market is the first set-up with the stark gumption to put an effusive staff member at the front door chivvying the customers for Asian bowl-food kitchen Ginger or vegan counter Indigo Greens over to the communal benches, while directing Pilgrims like me to the more formal restaurant up a flight of stairs, where a mezzanine overlooks the fun. Because Duke Street Market is definitely fun. Noisy fun. This is a 19th-century warehouse with exposed brick walls and a thunderous sound system. I tried three different tables before accepting that this was going to feel like eating gordal olives during a 1995 Dave Morales set at Cream, but at least this time I would be wearing actual clothes, not merely a Morgan De Toi pelmet and body butter. The trick is to order a large red vermouth on ice as a pre-starter and go with the rumpus. We began with good, fresh house bread with smoked butter and a plate of silver-skinned, delicious boquerones, marinated in sweet vinegar. A plate of fresh, green, defiantly al dente runner beans arrived on a puddle of the deepest, oiliest, most garlicky sofrito strewn with small, piquant, smoked cherry tomatoes. Green beans on red sauce shouldn\u2019t taste that good. Sure, I\u2019d have cooked the beans longer. Same, too for chargrilled leeks. I can only guess that the chef came from a family like mine, where Christmas sprouts were put on to simmer some time in late November, and has spent a culinary journey rebelling. We demolished the leeks nevertheless as they arrived, slathered in light-blue-veined cow\u2019s cheese, scattered with delicately candied walnut. I can\u2019t pretend the food at Pilgrim was perfect; a piece of monkfish tail in a vivid orange pimiento glaze was overcooked and slightly bizarre-tasting. But then a txuleton sirloin, served \u2013 no ifs or buts \u2013 rare, was a huge success on our table, arriving with a pond-green Castilian salsa heaving with thickly sliced melting onions. Pilgrim is a restaurant I want to return to again and again out of sheer curiosity. Their holy, walking-tour concept doesn\u2019t stifle them, but gives them a clear base for a foray into exquisite produce. The St James tart that Pilgrim served at the end \u2013 despite being, dare I say it, \u201cdeconstructed\u201d \u2013 was one of the greatest things I\u2019ve tasted this year. A slice of sticky, caramelised-edged sponge with a stew of burnt apple and fennel was served with soothing, sweet, milky ice-cream. Not the prettiest of puddings. Not the showiest. A cacophony of beige. Probably not worth walking 825km in sandals for; but if I can travel up the M6 on a Megabus, then I\u2019ll make a pilgrimage again this year. \u2022 Pilgrim 46 Duke Street, Liverpool, 07388 120098.

      "body": "<p>This month, Lee Child\u2019s latest novel \u2013 his 24th thriller featuring Jack Reacher, a 6ft 5in, 250lb former US army military policeman \u2013 will be at, or near, the top of the bestseller charts. The books have been a publishing phenomenon, a huge commercial fiction brand, since the Coventry-born author (real name Jim Grant) wrote the first, <em>Killing Floor</em>, in 1997, when he heard he was getting laid off from his job as a TV executive. The stories are, essentially, westerns. Reacher is a loner, a wanderer. He has never settled into a \u201cnormal\u201d life after leaving the army. He travels the US, hitching or taking the bus: it\u2019s a way of life he began as a means to explore the country, but by now, it\u2019s a compulsion. He carries only a toothbrush. He buys new clothes when he needs them, junks the old ones. He doesn\u2019t look for trouble, but trouble finds him. In each new town he solves the mystery, gets the bad guys and doles out rough justice. There\u2019s a lot of violence: guns, or scrappy hand-to-hand fighting. Kicks in the groin, punches to the head, elbows scything ferociously into flanks.</p> <p>For stories to be as successful as these, they need to be read by people who don\u2019t generally read. But what makes Reacher so fascinating is the books\u2019 appeal not only outside, but within the rarefied circles of the literati \u2013 unlike, say, the work of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/danbrown\" title=\"\">Dan Brown</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/el-james\" title=\"\">EL James</a>. Their success with the grandes dames of literature is especially striking. Antonia Fraser is a fan. Kate Atkinson is a fan. Margaret Drabble, asked earlier this year by the Guardian what book she wished she\u2019d written, answered: \u201cAnything by Lee Child. What page turners, what prose, what landscapes, what motorways and motels, what mythic dimensions! I read, awestruck, waiting impatiently for the next.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5e7f9bbf34bdb80e3ddbd894cb6ece65842a7207\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e7f9bbf34bdb80e3ddbd894cb6ece65842a7207/0_346_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I read, awestruck, waiting impatiently for the next\u2019 \u2026 Margaret Drabble.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I read, awestruck, waiting impatiently for the next\u2019 \u2026 Margaret Drabble.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then there are the academics. Margaret MacMillan, the great authority on the first world war and a recent Reith lecturer, absolutely loves Child\u2019s books. Jenny Davidson, professor of comparative literature at Columbia in New York, calls herself \u201can obsessive fan\u201d. She regards them as the absolute apogee of light reading: they are, she says, like the exquisite versions of fast food prepared by Michelin-starred chefs.</p> <p>I am no grande dame, but I love them too. I\u2019ve read all 24. When finding a title for my last book (a non-fiction work about mazes and labyrinths) I thought to myself, \u201cWhat would Lee Child do?\u201d I called it <em>Red Thread</em>, which seemed to me to have a properly Reacher-esque pithiness. The new Lee Child, I am pleased to note, is called <em>Blue Moon</em>.</p> <p>What is it about Jack Reacher and literary women? Part of the draw is purely formal. Take this passage from <em>Blue Moon</em>, selected more or less at random:</p> <p><em>His limbs were slow because they were heavy, and they were heavy because they were not only thick but also long. In the case of his legs, very long. He drove hard off his left foot and kicked out with his right, stretching low, a huge vicious wingspan, aiming at anything, any part of the guy, any part of the swoop, any window of time, whatever came along.</em></p> <p>Simple words, strung together with a real mastery of rhythm. Nothing fancy. Think of the simplicity of a Shakespeare sonnet, its preference for one- and two-syllable words (\u201cRough winds do shake the darling buds of May\u201d). The repetition of \u201cheavy\u201d and \u201clong\u201d. The way the final sentence coils and stretches out, heavy and long itself, ready to deliver its killer kick. Child is a stickler for grammar. So is Reacher.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Reacher respects and likes women. Finds them delightful, and sexy. But not in a\u00a0creepy way</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Then there are the landscapes that Child conjures: the dusty nowhere-towns of the American flyover states; their diners and pawnshops and hardware stores. All of this is summoned up with extreme economy, helped along by particularly resonant recurring words and phrases: \u201cblacktop\u201d (asphalt), \u201cbackhoe\u201d (a digger), \u201ccloverleaf\u201d (a road-junction design). The place names themselves are resonant. Last year\u2019s story, <em>Past Tense</em>, was set in Laconia, New Hampshire. The original Laconia was the territory in Greece occupied by the ancient Spartans, famously ruthless warriors, like Reacher. From Laconia we derive the word laconic, a reference to their severe, economic and sometimes dryly witty way with words \u2013 Reacher\u2019s own verbal mode to a tee.</p> <p>There is a mythic heft to all this. \u201cReacher is the archetypal hero \u2013 the stranger who walks into town and avenges its wrongs \u2013 the classic trope identified by Auden in \u2018The Guilty Vicarage\u2019, his essay on detective fiction,\u201d says novelist Amanda Craig, another big fan. She calls him a \u201cmodern knight errant\u201d. In myths and fairytales, we expect certain patterns. So it is with Reacher stories. Guardian writer Steven Poole once asked novelist Haruki Murakami why he liked the books. \u201cEverything\u2019s the same!\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/13/haruki-murakami-interview-colorless-tsukur-tazaki-and-his-years-of-pilgrimage\" title=\"\">answered Murakami</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e9f0d6c695baa5d9f0f09bcb9d275d395956d021\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9f0d6c695baa5d9f0f09bcb9d275d395956d021/0_0_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jack Reacher author, Lee Child.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jack Reacher author, Lee Child.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of course, everything is not quite the same: Davidson points out how adept Child is at ringing the changes, writing flashback novels that deal with Reacher\u2019s army career, or switching between first-person and third-person stories. But it\u2019s true, on some fundamental level, that everything is the same. We know, more often than not, there will be a minor dust-up in the first 10 pages or so. We know that there will be a careful drip-feed of plot points and minor resolutions leading up to a climactic chapter of ferocious violence, where the bad guys will be dispatched. Resolution will come, and Reacher will ride out of town once more, taking absolutely nothing with him. The body count, 24 books in, is into the hundreds. Crime novelist Val McDermid writes a funny scene in her latest book, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/11/turn-of-the-key-platform-seven-perfect-wife-how-the-dead-speak-thrillers-of-the-month\" title=\"\">How </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/11/turn-of-the-key-platform-seven-perfect-wife-how-the-dead-speak-thrillers-of-the-month\" title=\"\">the Dead Speak</a></em>. Her character Carol Jordan, now an ex-cop herself, and suffering from PTSD, is on a stake out. She listens to a Lee Child on audiobook to help with the boredom. \u201cCarol thought that if his hero was real, after what he\u2019d been through in twenty-odd books, he\u2019d be in dire need of [trauma therapist] Melissa Rintoul\u2019s services.\u201d He would. But the mythic, formulaic elements of Reacher books are crucial to their enjoyment, and mustn\u2019t be tarnished with too much realism. No trauma therapy for Reacher.</p> <p>Which brings me to the violence itself. What makes it palatable is its extreme stylisation. The fight scenes in Reacher novels remind me of arming and battle scenes in the <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/feb/09/can-homers-iliad-speak-across-the-centuries\" title=\"\">Iliad</a></em>, with their recurrent shapes and turns of phrase. This stylisation is rendered partly through a radical deceleration of pace. In Andy Martin\u2019s book <em>Reacher Said Nothing</em> \u2013 for which Martin sat at Child\u2019s elbow through the composition of the novel <em>Make Me</em> \u2013 Child said that he had one rule. \u201cYou should write the fast stuff slow and the slow stuff fast.\u201d In <em>Blue Moon</em>, there are some prime examples. In one fight, eight blows in total are delivered by Reacher and his assailants \u2013 this takes four whole pages to describe, and is punctuated by a chapter break. Only very occasionally does Reacher fight women, and this is when the violence arguably tips over from enjoyably stylised to something more gratuitous. <em>Gone Tomorrow</em>, with its graphic account of a woman\u2019s \u201cflawless face\u201d being \u201cruined\u201d before her throat is cut \u201cear to ear\u201d is pretty dreadful (I\u2019ll spare you the details). But on the whole, he avoids the trope of exoticising or eroticising violence against women.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Women want to be Jack Reacher: to abandon all responsibilities, to be physically invincible</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Reacher will often team up with an ally in his adventures. That ally will frequently be an attractive, competent woman employed in some branch of law enforcement, with whom he may have a brief, consensual, mutually satisfying affair. Which brings me to another fundamental part of the stories\u2019 appeal to women, notwithstanding the example above: their understated feminism. Reacher respects and likes women. Finds them delightful, and sexy. But not in a creepy way. The female characters are invariably self-sufficient, neither needy nor tortured; it is surprisingly difficult to find such women in popular fiction written by men.</p> <p>In some ways, <em>Blue Moon</em> might be read as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/metoo-movement\" title=\"\">post\u2011#MeToo</a> story. One of the injustices righted in this story turns on male aggression towards women, and sexual exploitation. has an especially grim denouement, bloody even by Child\u2019s standards it is hard not to read it \u2013 on one level, at least \u2013 as female revenge drama.</p> <p>There\u2019s that. But do women fancy Jack Reacher? Do female readers fantasise about him? Well, some clearly do. That said, he is \u201ca big ugly guy\u201d built like \u201ca brick outhouse\u201d. Not my type. I think the real point is that women want to be him. That\u2019s the fantasy: to abandon all responsibilities, to walk through the world with nothing. To be physically invincible. To be justifiably fearless. </p> <p><em>\u2022 Lee Child\u2019s Blue Moon is published by Bantam on 29 October.

In some ways, Blue Moon might be read as a post\u2011#MeToo story. One of the injustices righted in this story turns on male aggression towards women, and sexual exploitation. has an especially grim denouement, bloody even by Child\u2019s standards it is hard not to read it \u2013 on one level, at least \u2013 as female revenge drama. There\u2019s that. But do women fancy Jack Reacher? Do female readers fantasise about him? Well, some clearly do. That said, he is \u201ca big ugly guy\u201d built like \u201ca brick outhouse\u201d. Not my type. I think the real point is that women want to be him. That\u2019s the fantasy: to abandon all responsibilities, to walk through the world with nothing. To be physically invincible. To be justifiably fearless. \u2022 Lee Child\u2019s Blue Moon is published by Bantam on 29 October. To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com or call 020-3176 3837.

No written word of her life survives. Here to stay \u2026 However, in 1988 she was identified as a model in a number of pre-Raphaelite paintings where she appears as figures as diverse as Moses\u2019s Mother and Morgan le Fay. Graceful echo \u2026 This 1861 study by another woman long overlooked by history, Joanna Boyce Wells, was a preparatory work for a never-realised painting of a Libyan sibyl. It\u2019s a graceful echo of Michelangelo\u2019s sibyl in the Sistine Chapel. Strong women \u2026 Boyce Wells was a talented painter whose career was cut short when she died from infection after childbirth. Strong women rank among her standout subjects: rebel queens and, as is the case here, a visionary priestess. Included in Pre-Raphaelite Sisters, National Portrait Gallery, WC2, to 26 January",

The reasons for refusing bail are subject to a non-publication order.</p> <p>Dressed in a grey jumper, Chan appeared via video link from Long Bay jail hospital. He appeared impassive throughout the hearing, and only sought to speak, through an interpreter, at the end of the hearing, when his microphone was turned off.</p> <p>Choi, a naturalised Australian citizen of South Korean origin, was arrested in December 2017, after a raid on his home in the Sydney suburb of Eastwood. He has been in custody on remand since then.</p> <p>Police allege he was acting as an \u201ceconomic agent\u201d for the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, seeking to generate income for the isolated North Korean regime by selling weapons technology and resources, in breach of Australian and United Nations sanctions.</p> <p>He has been charged with offences under the Charter of the United Nations Act and the Autonomous Sanctions Act, as well as the Weapons of Mass Destruction Act. The maximum penalty for these offences is 10 years\u2019 imprisonment.</p> <p>The Guardian has seen a police statement of alleged facts. These have not been tested in court and have not been agreed to by Choi\u2019s defence.</p> <p>The statement alleges Choi used a web of blackmarket contacts in Syria, Taiwan, Cambodia and Russia to broker deals mostly in coal and iron, but also in weapons technology, including short-range missiles.</p> <p>The statement cites Choi\u2019s regular overseas travel, including to North Korea, and alleged email correspondence that reveals a declared loyalty to the North Korean regime. An email allegedly from the regime praised Choi\u2019s devotion and willingness to \u201cwork hard for our country\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cEven when you are far away from our country, in your heart there is the country, so I am certain that your project will run successfully,\u201d the email, sent in July 2013, allegedly said of Choi.</p> <p>The police statement alleges Choi, who used the pseudonym Solomon in his negotiations, developed a code to discuss weapons sales on the phone, referring to missiles as \u201cpine trees\u201d and missile factories as \u201cnurseries\u201d.</p> <p>When Choi was arrested, Australian federal police assistant commissioner Neil Gaughan stressed Choi was not alleged to have engaged in syping, but simply to have tried to raise money for the North Korean regime.</p> <p>Gaughan said evidence suggested Choi had been in contact \u201cwith high-ranking North Korean officials\u201d but did not provide details.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe this man participated in discussions about the sale of missile componentry from North Korea to other entities abroad.\u201d</p> <p>Gaughan would not identify the alleged international entities or their location, but said there were no governments or government officials involved.</p> <p>According to the police allegations, Choi described himself as North Korea\u2019s \u201cinternational commerce\u201d liaison, working on behalf of the highest echelons of the DPRK government.</p> <p>\u201cI am a recognised strategist that has favour with Kim Jong Eun [sic],\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>Police allege the various deals Choi attempted to broker did not go ahead.</p> <p>The police allegations state that in late 2017 Choi brokered the sale of missiles and missile technology with a Taiwanese contact. They also state that he negotiated to send experts to the contact to help operate the technology.

      "bodyText": "A Sydney man charged over allegations he was a sanctions-busting \u201ceconomic agent\u201d of the North Korean regime attempting to sell ballistic missiles overseas has been refused bail. Choi Han Chan, 60, is the first person ever charged under Australia\u2019s Weapons of Mass Destruction (Prevention of Proliferation) Act. Police have alleged Choi attempted to broker the sale of North Korean missiles and missile components internationally, and to sell coal and other resources from North Korea to entities in Indonesia and Vietnam. It is alleged some of the missile components identified could be used in the delivery system for a weapon of mass destruction. Bail was refused in the New South Wales supreme court in Sydney on Friday by Justice Julia Lonergan. The reasons for refusing bail are subject to a non-publication order. Dressed in a grey jumper, Chan appeared via video link from Long Bay jail hospital. He appeared impassive throughout the hearing, and only sought to speak, through an interpreter, at the end of the hearing, when his microphone was turned off. Choi, a naturalised Australian citizen of South Korean origin, was arrested in December 2017, after a raid on his home in the Sydney suburb of Eastwood. He has been in custody on remand since then. Police allege he was acting as an \u201ceconomic agent\u201d for the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, seeking to generate income for the isolated North Korean regime by selling weapons technology and resources, in breach of Australian and United Nations sanctions. He has been charged with offences under the Charter of the United Nations Act and the Autonomous Sanctions Act, as well as the Weapons of Mass Destruction Act. The maximum penalty for these offences is 10 years\u2019 imprisonment. The Guardian has seen a police statement of alleged facts. These have not been tested in court and have not been agreed to by Choi\u2019s defence. The statement alleges Choi used a web of blackmarket contacts in Syria, Taiwan, Cambodia and Russia to broker deals mostly in coal and iron, but also in weapons technology, including short-range missiles. The statement cites Choi\u2019s regular overseas travel, including to North Korea, and alleged email correspondence that reveals a declared loyalty to the North Korean regime. An email allegedly from the regime praised Choi\u2019s devotion and willingness to \u201cwork hard for our country\u201d. \u201cEven when you are far away from our country, in your heart there is the country, so I am certain that your project will run successfully,\u201d the email, sent in July 2013, allegedly said of Choi. The police statement alleges Choi, who used the pseudonym Solomon in his negotiations, developed a code to discuss weapons sales on the phone, referring to missiles as \u201cpine trees\u201d and missile factories as \u201cnurseries\u201d. When Choi was arrested, Australian federal police assistant commissioner Neil Gaughan stressed Choi was not alleged to have engaged in syping, but simply to have tried to raise money for the North Korean regime. Gaughan said evidence suggested Choi had been in contact \u201cwith high-ranking North Korean officials\u201d but did not provide details. \u201cWe believe this man participated in discussions about the sale of missile componentry from North Korea to other entities abroad.\u201d Gaughan would not identify the alleged international entities or their location, but said there were no governments or government officials involved. According to the police allegations, Choi described himself as North Korea\u2019s \u201cinternational commerce\u201d liaison, working on behalf of the highest echelons of the DPRK government. \u201cI am a recognised strategist that has favour with Kim Jong Eun [sic],\u201d he wrote. Police allege the various deals Choi attempted to broker did not go ahead. The police allegations state that in late 2017 Choi brokered the sale of missiles and missile technology with a Taiwanese contact. They also state that he negotiated to send experts to the contact to help operate the technology. But the alleged deal was disrupted by \u201cmachinations internal to the DPRK\u201d and had been abandoned prior to his arrest. Correction: This article was amended on Sunday 20 October 2019 to clarify allegations around the timing of the proposed missile negotiations and Choi\u2019s arrest.",

In what seems to be an increasingly quick hit world, it will be interesting to see if the Tote\u2019s new owners can rekindle interest in a contest that demands a considerable investment of time and effort. The Tote will also continue to be the public face of pool betting at most British racecourses via its partnership with Britbet, which had seemed poised to go it alone on Britain\u2019s tracks until an agreement was reached last year to ensure that a single pool would operate on British racing. As a result, the future for the Tote looks brighter than it has for many years. \u201cPool betting plays a leading role in racing jurisdictions around the world,\u201d Frost said on Wednesday, \u201cand we believe the Tote can play a similar role in the UK, while supporting and growing British racing in the years ahead.\u201d Many of the investors in the UKTG are involved in racing as owners or breeders and there will doubtless be an attempt to sell the new Tote as racing\u2019s in-house betting operation.

The cost for all this positivity would be \u00a326.9m but there is a sticking point. <strong>Milan</strong> want a replacement and would only be willing to let Kessi\u00e9 leave if they can secure <strong>Mohamed Elneny</strong> from Arsenal for \u00a313m in January. But let\u2019s be honest, Elneny hardly has a queue of suitors lining up to whisk him away now does he?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/17/manchester-united-recruitment-ed-woodward\">Manchester United\u2019s recruitment has been dysfunctional, admits Ed Woodward</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Manchester City</strong> scouts visited Anfield at the beginning of the month but don\u2019t fret Liverpool fans, they\u2019re not about to launch an astonishing bid to take James Milner back to the Etihad. Nope. They went to see RB Salzburg striker <strong>Erling H\u00e5land</strong> in the flesh \u2013 and the sound of \u00a350m being counted out at the Etihad that The Mill can hear would suggest that they liked what they saw.

The Barcelona midfielder\u2019s family have taken a look at the weather forecast in Manchester and told the Croat to consider another European city in which to ply his trade. A crisp winter and French cuisine has made <strong>PSG</strong> the new favourites to sign him.

      "bodyText": "The curious thing about Wolves\u2019 defeat of Manchester City a fortnight ago is that it could have been much more comfortable had Patrick Cutrone not seemingly had his boots on the wrong way round. It\u2019s not gone unnoticed by Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo that the young striker, signed from Milan in the summer for \u00a316m, is taking his time to settle at Molineux. What he needs is a familiar face in the ranks to help him feel comfortable \u2013 surely then the goals will come. Step forward Franck Kessi\u00e9. The midfielder had a fine understanding with Cutrone at Milan last season and was close to joining Wolves in the summer window only for the transfer to fall through. But Milan\u2019s dire financial situation means a move is back on again. The box-to-box Ivory Coast international would bring even more energy to Nuno\u2019s side and a smile back to Cutrone\u2019s face. The cost for all this positivity would be \u00a326.9m but there is a sticking point. Milan want a replacement and would only be willing to let Kessi\u00e9 leave if they can secure Mohamed Elneny from Arsenal for \u00a313m in January. But let\u2019s be honest, Elneny hardly has a queue of suitors lining up to whisk him away now does he? Manchester City scouts visited Anfield at the beginning of the month but don\u2019t fret Liverpool fans, they\u2019re not about to launch an astonishing bid to take James Milner back to the Etihad. Nope. They went to see RB Salzburg striker Erling H\u00e5land in the flesh \u2013 and the sound of \u00a350m being counted out at the Etihad that The Mill can hear would suggest that they liked what they saw. The 19-year-old was suffering from the lurgee yet still leapt off the bench to frighten the life out of home fans by scoring a goal and giving Virgil van Dijk the most uncomfortable time he\u2019s had in the north-west since he was rumbled meeting Klopp for a cosy chat in Blackpool two years ago. Oh, and while we\u2019re on the subject of coveted players meeting opposing teams\u2019 managers in seaside resorts, Paul Pogba crossed paths with Zinedine Zidane by the side of a pool in Dubai during the international break. For some, it is hard proof that the moody Manchester United midfielder will be off to Real Madrid next summer. For others, it\u2019s yet more evidence that off-duty footballers have very little imagination these days when it comes to choosing somewhere sunny to spend their downtime. If Pogba does end up in Madrid in January, Ivan Rakitic will not be replacing him at Old Trafford. The Barcelona midfielder\u2019s family have taken a look at the weather forecast in Manchester and told the Croat to consider another European city in which to ply his trade. A crisp winter and French cuisine has made PSG the new favourites to sign him. Another 31-year-old on the move is Nemanja Matic. Internazionale are readying a bid in January to rescue the midfielder from Manchester United, where his stock has fallen so low he can\u2019t even get a game ahead of Fred. Everton are the one Premier League club who can rival Manchester United when it comes to a scattergun approach to signing players they really don\u2019t need. They will do battle with Old Trafford bean counters for the Lyon striker Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, who has been scoring for fun in Ligue 1 this season. A move away from Lyon would be bad news for Celtic, though, with the French club likely to throw in a huge bid for Odsonne \u00c9douard to replace Demb\u00e9l\u00e9.

Their common denominator was the great cellist Mstislav Rostropovich, for whom both wrote works, and those pieces provide the backbone to this weekend devoted to Britten\u2019s relationship with Russia. Alban Gerhardt plays Britten\u2019s Cello Suites and his Symphony for Cello and Orchestra, and the weekend will end with a recreation of the 1960 London concert at which the composers first met. <br><em><a href=\"https://snapemaltings.co.uk/season/britten-weekend/\">Snape Maltings Concert Hall, Saturday 19 &amp; Sunday 20 October</a></em></p> <h2>Reich/Richter</h2> <p>For Steve Reich\u2019s latest score he has worked with the German painter Gerhard Richter, who has produced digital images derived from his painting 946-3, to which Reich has composed music.

But this year does include one contemporary work, La Cucina by Andrew Synnott, in a double bill with Rossini\u2019s Adina; Massenet\u2019s Don Quichotte also features. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.wexfordopera.com/\">National Opera House, Wexford, Tuesday 22 October to 2 November</a></em></p> <p><em>AC</em></p> <h2><strong>Five of the best \u2026 exhibitions</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0355df262b0abc6ba14f4ad69638fa6b806e0ca4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0355df262b0abc6ba14f4ad69638fa6b806e0ca4/26_650_2828_2689/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George Stubbs\u2019s Whistlejacket, 1762\" width=\"1000\" height=\"951\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Horse sense\u2026 George Stubbs\u2019s Whistlejacket, 1762.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The National Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Bridget Riley</h2> <p>This joyous retrospective of a great British artist is a blast of energy and light. Riley\u2019s early experiments in the style of Seurat fill your eyes with colour, then her black-and-white 1960s abstractions take your mind for a spin. The rush continues on an optical magic carpet right up to her current works. Hallucinogenic. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whats-on/exhibitions/hayward-gallery-art/bridget-riley\">Hayward Gallery, SE1, Wednesday 23 October to 26 January</a></em></p> <h2>Elizabeth Price</h2> <p>The work that won video artist Price the 2012 Turner prize, The Woolworths Choir of 1979, tells the story of a lethal fire in a Manchester Woolworths store 40 years ago that killed 10 people. Here it gets its first showing in the city. Price\u2019s film remembers the events with atmospheric, dread-laden sound and images. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.whitworth.manchester.ac.uk/whats-on/exhibitions/upcomingexhibitions/elizabethprice/\">The Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester, Friday 25 October to 1 March</a></em></p> <h2>George Stubbs</h2> <p>This excellent survey of one of Britain\u2019s strangest and greatest artists brings together his anatomical drawings with his animal paintings. Stubbs got a training in human anatomy before he dissected horses in the most detailed study of their bodies ever performed. Those powerful, pioneering scientific images are shown here alongside paintings including a portrait of a rhino. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.mkgallery.org/whats-on/george-stubbs-all-done-nature/\">MK Gallery, Milton Keynes, to 26 January</a></em></p> <h2>Albert Oehlen</h2> <p>The mug and mire of modern life hangs like a veil of rain over this German painter\u2019s ambiguous canvases. Forms and words appear only to get lost in the urban mist. Oehlen has a reputation as a rebel and was friends with the heroically subversive Martin Kippenberger. He has also dabbled in electronic music \u2013 maybe you should listen to Kraftwerk while sampling his art. For all these countercultural associations his work is very painterly. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.serpentinegalleries.org/exhibitions-events/albert-oehlen\">Serpentine Gallery, W2, to 2 February</a></em></p> <h2>Magnum Manifesto</h2> <p>The Magnum agency, founded by photographers themselves in 1947, has an unrivalled name for reportage. This survey amounts to a visual history of modern times, featuring some of the defining shots of our world by photographers such as Henri Cartier-Bresson, Olivia Arthur and Robert Capa with the courage, instinct and luck to freeze history. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.comptonverney.org.uk/thing-to-do/magnum-manifesto-2/\">Compton Verney, nr Warwick, to 15 December</a></em></p> <p><em>JJ</em></p> <h2><strong>Five of the best \u2026 theatre shows</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9f6506002e8f97799d99e40eb78c697c2864644e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f6506002e8f97799d99e40eb78c697c2864644e/39_0_3277_1966/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Antipodes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Baker\u2019s feast\u2026 The Antipodes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manuel Harlan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The Antipodes</h2> <p>Annie Baker\u2019s plays are strange and mesmerising \u2013 and often end up slowly transforming into an almost mystical experience. Baker\u2019s latest work, which she also directs alongside Chloe Lamford, follows on from acclaimed National Theatre runs of The Flick and John and is about a group of people who sit around telling stories. It sounds simple, but will be anything but. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/the-antipodes\">National Theatre: Dorfman, SE1, Monday 21 October to 23 November</a></em></p> <h2>Baby Reindeer</h2> <p>Richard Gadd\u2019s Edinburgh hit transfers to London. The comic\u2019s debut play, it is a chilling and deeply personal work about Gadd\u2019s experience with a stalker. Baby Reindeer features real-life voicemails and messages from Gadd\u2019s stalker and is an unflinching and deeply unsettling piece of theatre. Jon Brittain, himself a writer of great merit, directs. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.bushtheatre.co.uk/event/baby-reindeer/\">Bush Theatre, W12, to 9 November</a></em></p> <h2>Hedda Gabler</h2> <p>Another month, another Hedda Gabler. No prizes for guessing why Ibsen\u2019s play about an oppressed wife and mother is hitting a nerve right now. This production will use Brian Friel\u2019s typically brilliant adaptation. Chelsea Walker will direct a talented trio of Welsh actors, with Marc Antolin as George Tesman and Richard Mylan as Judge Brack. Heledd Gwynn plays Hedda and she\u2019s frankly terrifying \u2013 and that\u2019s just in the trailer. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.shermantheatre.co.uk/performance/theatre/hedda-gabler/\">Sherman Cymru, Cardiff, to 2 November</a></em></p> <h2>Mold Riots</h2> <p>The miners of Mold stand trial for attacking their manager after their wages are lowered. A crowd gather to hear the verdict: will justice prevail? One hundred and fifty years after riots that tore apart a local community, the streets of Mold will be shut down for an epic piece of promenade theatre. Katie Posner will direct a roaming cast of 100, including a few professional actors, a heap of community volunteers and 30 children. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.theatrclwyd.com/en/whats-on/mold-riots/\">Theatr Clwyd, Mold, Monday 21 to 26 October</a></em></p> <h2>Little Baby Jesus</h2> <p>Arinz\u00e9 Kene recently starred in Marianne Elliot\u2019s phenomenal revival of Death of a Salesman, but he is also a playwright of real energy and passion. Kene\u2019s breakthrough drama was Misty, an electrifying one-man show that ran to rave reviews. Little Baby Jesus is one of Kene\u2019s earlier works and is a trio of interlocking monologues about the lives of three inner-city teenagers. The show will be directed by JMK winner Tristan Fynn-Aiduenu. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.orangetreetheatre.co.uk/whats-on/little-baby-jesus\">Orange Tree Theatre, Richmond, to 16 November</a></em></p> <p><em>MG</em></p> <h2><strong>Three of the best \u2026 dance shows</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"513173910083949207e6973b22661e30c185bcca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/513173910083949207e6973b22661e30c185bcca/0_217_4961_2976/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Circle by Scottish Dance Theatre.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Circle by Scottish Dance Theatre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Hartley/stillmotion.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Scottish Dance Theatre</h2> <p>Featuring wearable art sculptures and a score from Squarepusher, The Circle \u2013 by Israeli choreographer Emanuel Gat \u2013 is different every time it\u2019s performed, as the 12 dancers make real-time decisions on stage.

Argir\u00f2 will unveil the enticingly spacious soundscapes of her new Hidden Seas album, including French vocalist Le\u00efla Martial\u2019s remarkable palette of influences from Bj\u00f6rk to Bobby McFerrin, and western and non-western sounds. Nottingham, Wednesday 23; Leeds &amp; Newcastle upon Tyne, Friday 25 October; touring to 2 November JF Three of the best \u2026 classical concerts Britten and Russia Benjamin Britten\u2019s friendship with Dmitri Shostakovich lasted from 1960 until the Russian\u2019s death in 1975. Their common denominator was the great cellist Mstislav Rostropovich, for whom both wrote works, and those pieces provide the backbone to this weekend devoted to Britten\u2019s relationship with Russia. Alban Gerhardt plays Britten\u2019s Cello Suites and his Symphony for Cello and Orchestra, and the weekend will end with a recreation of the 1960 London concert at which the composers first met. Snape Maltings Concert Hall, Saturday 19 &amp; Sunday 20 October Reich/Richter For Steve Reich\u2019s latest score he has worked with the German painter Gerhard Richter, who has produced digital images derived from his painting 946-3, to which Reich has composed music. Colin Currie conducts the Britten Sinfonia, and precedes Reich/Richter with Reich\u2019s 2016 ensemble piece Runner. Barbican Hall, EC2, Wednesday 23; Saffron Hall, Saffron Walden, Thursday 24 October Wexford festival opera There are plenty of operas from the last 100 years that need to be revived just as badly as Wexford\u2019s usual 18th- and 19th-century pieces. But this year does include one contemporary work, La Cucina by Andrew Synnott, in a double bill with Rossini\u2019s Adina; Massenet\u2019s Don Quichotte also features. National Opera House, Wexford, Tuesday 22 October to 2 November AC Five of the best \u2026 exhibitions Bridget Riley This joyous retrospective of a great British artist is a blast of energy and light. Riley\u2019s early experiments in the style of Seurat fill your eyes with colour, then her black-and-white 1960s abstractions take your mind for a spin. The rush continues on an optical magic carpet right up to her current works. Hallucinogenic. Hayward Gallery, SE1, Wednesday 23 October to 26 January Elizabeth Price The work that won video artist Price the 2012 Turner prize, The Woolworths Choir of 1979, tells the story of a lethal fire in a Manchester Woolworths store 40 years ago that killed 10 people. Here it gets its first showing in the city. Price\u2019s film remembers the events with atmospheric, dread-laden sound and images. The Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester, Friday 25 October to 1 March George Stubbs This excellent survey of one of Britain\u2019s strangest and greatest artists brings together his anatomical drawings with his animal paintings. Stubbs got a training in human anatomy before he dissected horses in the most detailed study of their bodies ever performed. Those powerful, pioneering scientific images are shown here alongside paintings including a portrait of a rhino. MK Gallery, Milton Keynes, to 26 January Albert Oehlen The mug and mire of modern life hangs like a veil of rain over this German painter\u2019s ambiguous canvases. Forms and words appear only to get lost in the urban mist. Oehlen has a reputation as a rebel and was friends with the heroically subversive Martin Kippenberger. He has also dabbled in electronic music \u2013 maybe you should listen to Kraftwerk while sampling his art. For all these countercultural associations his work is very painterly. Serpentine Gallery, W2, to 2 February Magnum Manifesto The Magnum agency, founded by photographers themselves in 1947, has an unrivalled name for reportage. This survey amounts to a visual history of modern times, featuring some of the defining shots of our world by photographers such as Henri Cartier-Bresson, Olivia Arthur and Robert Capa with the courage, instinct and luck to freeze history. Compton Verney, nr Warwick, to 15 December JJ Five of the best \u2026 theatre shows The Antipodes Annie Baker\u2019s plays are strange and mesmerising \u2013 and often end up slowly transforming into an almost mystical experience. Baker\u2019s latest work, which she also directs alongside Chloe Lamford, follows on from acclaimed National Theatre runs of The Flick and John and is about a group of people who sit around telling stories. It sounds simple, but will be anything but. National Theatre: Dorfman, SE1, Monday 21 October to 23 November Baby Reindeer Richard Gadd\u2019s Edinburgh hit transfers to London. The comic\u2019s debut play, it is a chilling and deeply personal work about Gadd\u2019s experience with a stalker. Baby Reindeer features real-life voicemails and messages from Gadd\u2019s stalker and is an unflinching and deeply unsettling piece of theatre. Jon Brittain, himself a writer of great merit, directs. Bush Theatre, W12, to 9 November Hedda Gabler Another month, another Hedda Gabler. No prizes for guessing why Ibsen\u2019s play about an oppressed wife and mother is hitting a nerve right now. This production will use Brian Friel\u2019s typically brilliant adaptation. Chelsea Walker will direct a talented trio of Welsh actors, with Marc Antolin as George Tesman and Richard Mylan as Judge Brack. Heledd Gwynn plays Hedda and she\u2019s frankly terrifying \u2013 and that\u2019s just in the trailer. Sherman Cymru, Cardiff, to 2 November Mold Riots The miners of Mold stand trial for attacking their manager after their wages are lowered. A crowd gather to hear the verdict: will justice prevail? One hundred and fifty years after riots that tore apart a local community, the streets of Mold will be shut down for an epic piece of promenade theatre. Katie Posner will direct a roaming cast of 100, including a few professional actors, a heap of community volunteers and 30 children. Theatr Clwyd, Mold, Monday 21 to 26 October Little Baby Jesus Arinz\u00e9 Kene recently starred in Marianne Elliot\u2019s phenomenal revival of Death of a Salesman, but he is also a playwright of real energy and passion. Kene\u2019s breakthrough drama was Misty, an electrifying one-man show that ran to rave reviews. Little Baby Jesus is one of Kene\u2019s earlier works and is a trio of interlocking monologues about the lives of three inner-city teenagers. The show will be directed by JMK winner Tristan Fynn-Aiduenu. Orange Tree Theatre, Richmond, to 16 November MG Three of the best \u2026 dance shows Scottish Dance Theatre Featuring wearable art sculptures and a score from Squarepusher, The Circle \u2013 by Israeli choreographer Emanuel Gat \u2013 is different every time it\u2019s performed, as the 12 dancers make real-time decisions on stage. Extra treats in Dundee and London see The Circle as half of a double bill with Sharon Eyal\u2019s Process Day. Dundee Rep, Saturday 19; The Place, WC1, Tuesday 22; Tramway, Glasgow, Friday 25 &amp; 26 October; touring to 5 November Some Like It Hip Hop A hit for choreographer Kate Prince and ZooNation back in 2011, this feelgood dance musical returns with its upbeat energy, zany comedy and hip-hop highjinks. Expect fantastic dancing, catchy soul and R&amp;B songs and a convoluted but enjoyable plot. Birmingham Hippodrome, Saturday 19; Peacock Theatre, WC2, Wednesday 23 October to 9 November Rambert2 When it launched last year, Rambert\u2019s junior company blew everyone\u2019s socks off with its edgy work and youthful energy. Now a new cohort of dancers tackle works by Jermaine Spivey, Andrea Miller, and Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui and Damien Jalet. NST City Southampton, Thursday 24 &amp; Friday 25 October; touring to 30 January LW",

Losing just four league games all year long, they set a new standard in Major League Soccer and head into the playoffs as the firm favorites. In Bob Bradley, LAFC boast the best coach in the league and in Carlos Vela they boast the best player, certainly the best goalscorer. All this in just their second year as an MLS franchise. <strong>GR</strong></p> <p>The league\u2019s self-inflicted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/21/mls-and-antifa-americas-top-flight-grapples-with-political-signage-ban\">PR nightmare over Iron Front banners</a>.

With ongoing protests throughout the league, the league <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/25/mls-lifts-ban-iron-front-soccer-symbols-antifa\">rolled back their position</a> and promised to incorporate supporters in discussions about the policy. If they hadn\u2019t policed supporters so strictly, few people would have even recognized the symbol. <strong>JF</strong></p> <h2><strong>Your dark horses are\u2026</strong></h2> <p>At the midpoint of the regular season, Toronto FC seemed to have reached some sort of breaking point. A playoff run looked unlikely, but the 2017 MLS Cup winners finished the campaign well. In fact, their end-of-season form was the best in the league, with their last defeat coming all the way back at the start of August. Momentum is such an important thing in the playoffs and TFC have it right now. <strong>GR</strong></p> <p>The Portland Timbers were huge underdogs when they fell short to Atlanta United in last year\u2019s MLS Cup final and they\u2019ll be hoping to relive some of the magic that got them there. A squad that features Diego Chara and Diego Valeri are a perennial danger come playoffs. Their veteran savvy and a solid road-record (given the new playoff format) makes them a dangerous team despite their low seed. <strong>JF</strong></p> <h2><strong>Player to watch</strong></h2> <p>The only thing that could stop Josef Martinez\u2019s record-breaking scoring run was injury. The Venezuelan had found the net in 12 consecutive MLS games before suffering a knee and ankle injury in a game against San Jose last month. There were fears that Martinez would be ruled out of the playoffs as a result, but the striker returned to action in the final match of the regular season, scoring his 27th goal of the season. Atlanta United are so reliant on him. If Martinez can pick up where he left off, the Five Stripes will be a force again. <strong>GR</strong></p> <p>Carlos Vela. Just one season after Josef Martinez set the MLS single-season goals record at 31, Vela hit 34, with 15 assists to boot. He\u2019s scored in his last nine games, and closed the regular season with a hat-trick. It\u2019s a remarkable feat, and one LAFC fans will hope he continues in order to lead them to a Cup win. <strong>JF</strong></p> <h2><strong>High-seeded team at risk of going out early</strong></h2> <p>LAFC deserve their status as MLS Cup favourites. However, their first playoff tie could see them pitted against the LA Galaxy - their bogey team. For all that Bradley\u2019s team have blown away the rest of MLS in 2019, they have still to get the better of their closest rivals in five meetings. <strong>GR</strong></p> <p>As the third seed in the Eastern Conference, the Philadelphia Union have come off the best campaign in their history. The bad news is that they come into the playoffs having lost three of their last four with their sole win coming against the San Jose Earthquakes, who lost their last six. They start off their playoffs against the New York Red Bulls, to whom recently lost 2-0. <strong>JF</strong></p> <h2><strong>Which former Premier League star will make a bigger splash: Zlatan or Wayne?</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e90b94b137d3362c7ddb59ccd13cda1aca2ed6b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e90b94b137d3362c7ddb59ccd13cda1aca2ed6b4/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zlatan Ibrahimovic in a familiar pose this season\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zlatan Ibrahimovic in a familiar pose this season.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s difficult to look past Zlatan Ibrahimovic. The Swede has scored an astonishing 50 goals in 49 appearances for LA Galaxy over 2018 and 2019. Were it not for Vela, this would have been The Year of Zlatan in MLS. It could still work out that way with the LA Galaxy on course to meet LAFC in the Western Conference semi-finals. Ibrahimovic has made a habit of finding his best form against the Supporters\u2019 Shield winners, scoring two hat-tricks and eight goals in five games against LAFC. A playoff meeting could see him deliver the season\u2019s defining moment. <strong>GR</strong></p> <p>Zlatan. The Galaxy have finally given the Swede some help in the form of a midseason acquisition of Argentinian Cristian Pavon, and the rising tide has lifted all ships. Pavon has excelled, tallying eight assists and three goals in 11 games, while Zlatan has become only the third MLS player to score 30 goals, doing so in 29 games. <strong>JF</strong></p> <h2><strong>Is the new playoff format an improvement?</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s certainly true that the playoff format needed trimming down. The postseason in recent years had dragged on, dulling the sense of excitement by the time the conference finals and MLS Cup arrived. However, two-legged ties offer a dynamic of their own. Entire fanbases will now be robbed of the chance to see their team play the most important games of the season. A better option would have been to cut the number of playoff spots on offer. <strong>GR</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s far from perfect. Allowing more teams into the playoffs cheapens the regular season. Teams are punished for having stars make international squads as the postseason starts so soon after the international break. The timing of the format, with some four-day gaps, will lower the quality of play. And the one-game series mean fewer fans will be able to see their team at home, while increasing the impact of luck. At the same time, I don\u2019t have a workable suggestion to fix it. <strong>JF</strong></p> <h2><strong>Eastern Conference final</strong></h2> <p>Atlanta United 2-1 Toronto FC. <strong>GR</strong></p> <p>Atlanta United 2-1 NYC FC. <strong>JF</strong></p> <h2><strong>Western Conference final</strong></h2> <p>Los Angeles FC 3-2 Seattle Sounders. <strong>GR</strong></p> <p>Los Angeles FC 2-1 Seattle Sounders. <strong>JF</strong></p> <h2><strong>MLS Cup final</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a979300738964b9328f657c1a570c2f876af8531\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a979300738964b9328f657c1a570c2f876af8531/0_369_3795_2278/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Los Angeles FC fans may well be celebrating at the end of the MLS Cup final\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Los Angeles FC fans may well be celebrating at the end of the MLS Cup final.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ringo HW Chiu/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Los Angeles FC 3-1 Atlanta United. </strong>This would be a fitting end to a season that has largely been about one thing: goals.

      "body": "<p>Brock Osweiler has decided to retire after just seven seasons. He shuts the door on a career we should all envy, unless you\u2019re into all that gladiatorial glory stuff that football touts. Osweiler beat the system: He got into the league, helped win a Super Bowl, got his money and got out, all while maintaining his pristine teeth and long-term health. It\u2019s only fitting he called it quits during <a href=\"https://theundefeated.com/features/brocktober-may-be-back-the-week-that-was-august-26-29/\">Brocktober</a>.</p> <p>There was just something about Osweiler. He represented bigger ideals. He inspired heated debates on how teams evaluate talent in the modern age, the role of race in quarterback evaluations, whether height is an important attribute, how teams should allocate precious quarterback dollars and whether late-stage Peyton Manning was any good. And he was also goofy. An entire <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/the_lobster/\">subreddit</a> devoted to his Brock Lobster nickname persists to this day.</p> <p>Osweiler was tall and white and ungainly and gangly and mobile. The height alone made him a walking meme. You couldn\u2019t hear the name Osweiler without the numbers <em>six</em> and <em>eight</em> trailing somewhere thereafter. There was an awe factor to his height. It wasn\u2019t just that he felt rain earlier than the average man, it was that every part of him appeared tall, independently: his neck, his legs, his torso, his fingers. Together, they formed the second-tallest quarterback <a href=\"https://howtheyplay.com/team-sports/25-Tallest-Quarterback-to-Ever-Play-in-the-NFL\">on record</a>.</p> <p>Decision-makers were charmed by his ability to combine both feet and inches. Whether he threw passes to his teammates more often than the opponents was almost immaterial. Osweiler became the NFL\u2019s poster boy for failing up. He threw just 37 touchdowns to 31 interceptions over the span of his career. He never started a full season. He finished with a 15-15 career record as a starter playing for four different teams. In financial terms, Osweiler finished his career having earned $2.76m per win and $1.1m per touchdown pass. Yet no matter his sparse his output, he would inevitably stumble into another job.</p> <p>There have been over-priced, over-hyped quarterbacks who\u2019ve been dubbed stars-in-waiting after a decent run as a backup or playing well within a small sample size. But Osweiler became a perfect distillation of all that appeared wrong with quarterback evaluations in a post-Moneyball, analytics-friendly era. Forget that he was drafted a full round ahead of Russell Wilson; he was given two more opportunities after a third team paid a hefty price for him to kindly go away and never return.</p> <p>Osweiler represented <em>something</em> to the NFL\u2019s old guard. As old-school offenses were phased out and pace-and-space football worked its way up to the NFL ranks from high school by way of college ball, the types of quarterbacks being produced by the college ranks were different. They were slender and more mobile. They played in less complex systems. They were more efficient and multi-dimensional. Yet there were executives and coaches who clung onto hope that that prototypical guy \u2013 the tall, rhythm-based dropback passer \u2013 was still best. They were stubborn. <em>The old way is the way because that </em>is<em> the way.</em></p> <p>He was drafted in the second round by John Elway to serve as Peyton Manning\u2019s understudy after Elway had wooed the Hall of Famer to shift his operation to Denver. Elway\u2019s plan seemed inspired: ride out the final years of Manning\u2019s career, then transition to the young stud, who would have a Peyton-like knowledge of Peyton\u2019s offense learned behind the scenes.</p> <p>For three years Osweiler sat and learned. He got his shot during his fourth season as Manning\u2019s body started to fall apart, the Broncos offense with it. Osweiler did initially add a spark, complementing an all-time defense with just enough pop on behind the ball to guide the team towards the playoffs. He won five of his seven games, completed 61.8% of his passes and tossed 10 touchdowns. A Brockstar was born. The sports-shouting shows had <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y48oI_H7PO8\">real, actual discussions</a> about whether he would give the Wally Pipp treatment to Peyton. Some drew comparisons between the Tom Brady to Drew Bledsoe changing of the guard that kickstarted the Patriots reign.</p> <p>Then Manning returned. The Broncos <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/07/super-bowl-50-denver-broncos-defense-overwhelms-carolina-panthers\">won the whole thing</a> and Osweiler snagged a ring from the bench. Still, he\u2019d shown just enough to be a sought-after free agent. He jilted Denver and headed to Houston, inking a four-year deal worth $72m. With the Texans, he melted into a puddle. It was immediately obvious he wasn\u2019t the star the team hoped; he threw more interceptions than touchdowns in 14 starts.</p> <p>The Texans paid the Browns to clean up their mess. They gifted Cleveland a second-round pick, a highly prized asset that eventually became Nick Chubb, one of the top young running backs in the league. The then-tanking Browns wanted to hoard picks. They absorbed Osweiler\u2019s ridiculous cap figure then cut him before he had a chance to survey Ohio for quality rentals. No other player has had to suffer that kind of ignominy.</p> <p>Osweiler\u2019s career never recovered, if it ever took off in the first place. He spent four more seasons as a swing starter-backup pinballing from team to team: from Denver to Houston to Cleveland back to Denver and on to Miami. His opportunities eventually ran out.</p> <p>And yet Osweiler ultimately gets the last laugh. He will likely be on the broadcast circuit for the next three decades or so trading off his time with Manning. There will inevitably be a 30 for 30-style documentary on the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/spotrac/status/1184573841860890641\">2012 draft class</a>, the most fascinating collection of quarterback stories in a generation. Brock won\u2019t just feature, he\u2019ll be a key line of demarcation. His football career will live on in debates ranging from Colin Kaepernick to efficient team building to whether you should put someone on the field goal unit just because they\u2019re 6ft 7in, whether they can jump or not.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/rodger/status/671197707072073728\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Here&#39;s Brock Osweiler&#39;s sad FG block attempt on the Pats&#39; game-winning field goal in 2013:  <a href=\"https://t.co/099AOsSRtt\">https://t.co/099AOsSRtt</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/UacQWirwL1\">pic.twitter.com/UacQWirwL1</a></p>&mdash; Rodger Sherman (@rodger) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rodger/status/671197707072073728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 30, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>\u201cI have my health.

      "body": "<p>Mark Lanegan must be a terrible Cluedo player. His 11th studio album makes it pretty clear it was New Order, in the library, with the low-slung bass guitar. Possibly in collusion with Joy Division. Not that Somebody\u2019s Knocking is limited to trying to re-create the mood of Manchester in the 1980s, but Playing Nero, Name and Number and She Loved You are so directly indebted that you can\u2019t help but laugh at the brazenness of it. Why not rhyme fun with gun while you\u2019re at it and make it a full house? As Lanegan has explained, though, his love of electronic music predates him being surly rock\u2019s pinup, and it\u2019s a thread throughout Somebody\u2019s Knocking, albeit normally in the context of rock of some sort.

      "bodyText": "Mark Lanegan must be a terrible Cluedo player. His 11th studio album makes it pretty clear it was New Order, in the library, with the low-slung bass guitar. Possibly in collusion with Joy Division. Not that Somebody\u2019s Knocking is limited to trying to re-create the mood of Manchester in the 1980s, but Playing Nero, Name and Number and She Loved You are so directly indebted that you can\u2019t help but laugh at the brazenness of it. Why not rhyme fun with gun while you\u2019re at it and make it a full house? As Lanegan has explained, though, his love of electronic music predates him being surly rock\u2019s pinup, and it\u2019s a thread throughout Somebody\u2019s Knocking, albeit normally in the context of rock of some sort. This is very much not Mark Lanegan\u2019s EDM album. Sometimes there is the sense that he\u2019s not so much alchemising the past into something new as reminding you of other, rather better songs: Night Flight to Kabul and Dark Disco Jag might both make you want to seek out Sisters of Mercy\u2019s Dominion/Mother Russia instead.

A total of \u00a3253,200-worth of cocaine, \u00a3100,170-worth of crack cocaine and \u00a372,670-worth of heroin were seized. Police said they were \u201cdismantling these criminal networks piece by piece\u201d. The operation was led by the National County Lines Coordination Centre (NCLCC), a Home-Office-funded unit aiming to target the organised gangs that take their name from mobile phone lines criminals set up to receive orders from drug users. There are about 2,000 lines in operation. The county lines gangs use safe houses in smaller towns to support their operations in bigger cities, and often exploit young and vulnerable people by either taking over their homes, also called \u201ccuckooing\u201d, or by employing them as drug couriers. During the operation, 41 people were flagged up to the national referral mechanism, which assesses potential victims of human trafficking and modern slavery. The National Crime Agency said 652 men and 91 women had been arrested, and 655 cuckooed addresses had been visited. Duncan Ball, the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council lead for county lines, said: \u201cWe will not treat the criminals who run these lines just as drug dealers.

      "bodyText": "The New South Wales government is being urged to refer a Nationals MP to the corruption watchdog after the Guardian revealed that at least two farmers facing court said they broke land-clearing laws on his alleged say so. Two farmers who were being sentenced in the NSW land and environment court in recent months have told the judges hearing their cases that they ignored the old native vegetation laws because their local MP for Barwon, Kevin Humphries, had allegedly told them the laws would be scrapped and there would be no prosecutions. Instead, they faced court and received fines in the hundreds of thousands of dollars for offences committed before the laws were changed by the Berejiklian government in 2017. While both agreed that they should have made independent inquiries, the judges acknowledged that Humphries\u2019 representations had played a part in the farmers\u2019 decisions. \u201cThese allegations should be referred to Icac,\u201d Independent MP Justin Field said. \u201cThe Nationals have presided over a failed system of water and environmental management including encouraging landholders to break the law. The Nationals should be stripped of their natural resource portfolios. \u201cPremier Berejiklian must explain what she will do to assure the public that none of her ministers are making promises that are outside the law or are encouraging people to break the law, and sack any ministers that can\u2019t pass this test.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon The opposition spokesperson on the environment also expressed alarm. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t a meagre back bencher; he was a minister of the government who appears to have been giving out irresponsible advice to his constituents,\u201d said Kate Washington. \u201cThe amnesty on land clearing prosecutions [for breaches under the old native vegetation laws] is also about getting themselves off the hook,\u201d she said. The premier\u2019s office has declined to comment on the latest allegations about Humphries. Another farmer from Burren Junction, Anthony Barlow, made similar allegations in his trial for breaching the Water Act in NSW.

But his parents (Kelly Reilly and Max Martini) may have found a solution. In a remote, and comically creepy, mansion, a doctor (Lili Taylor) is offering an expensive experimental treatment that she claims will cure him. Risking everything, the family heads to the middle of nowhere in the hope that Eli might be able to finally live a normal life. But Eli is convinced that something is wrong. Why is the treatment making him feel worse? Can he really trust the doctor? And why is he being plagued by pesky ghosts?</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfSTiAw1rkM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qfSTiAw1rkM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Rather like the wonderful, little-seen New Zealand comedy horror <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housebound\">Housebound</a>, Eli is a haunted house film where the person being haunted is unable to leave. It\u2019s a nifty way of ensuring that a character who should otherwise be heading for the hills is forced to endure and then investigate the source of the malevolence. But are the ghosts trying to harm or help Eli? For a while there\u2019s some fun in trying to figure it all out with him and the film carefully leaves a number of possibilities dangling. It works better as a mystery than a horror with director Ciar\u00e1n Foy strangely incapable of constructing a solid fright. The film is scattered with a number of familiar horror sequences, from a couple of nasty dreams to some extended jump scares, but none of them really land.</p> <p>It\u2019s a mostly one-location film and, despite experience within the genre, Foy is never able to turn the house into enough of a character, it\u2019s never as frightening as it should be, atmosphere evaporating fast. The details of the plot prove more involving than the film that surrounds it, the script chugging along with speed, leading us along with curiosity at just what the film\u2019s big twist will be. When it comes, it\u2019s a decent surprise but it\u2019s confusingly, messily revealed and the film crumbles soon after, devolving into laughable silliness, almost deliberately so, as if Foy wasn\u2019t sure how to sell the finale with a straight face. Performances are mostly bland although Taylor does have some fun weaponising the soft tone of her voice.</p> <p>Like The Cloverfield Paradox before it, Eli is a film more suited to the small screen, where audience members can multi-task, perhaps even search for something better to watch next.</p> <ul> <li><p>Eli is available on Netflix now</p></li> </ul>",

But his parents (Kelly Reilly and Max Martini) may have found a solution. In a remote, and comically creepy, mansion, a doctor (Lili Taylor) is offering an expensive experimental treatment that she claims will cure him. Risking everything, the family heads to the middle of nowhere in the hope that Eli might be able to finally live a normal life. But Eli is convinced that something is wrong. Why is the treatment making him feel worse? Can he really trust the doctor? And why is he being plagued by pesky ghosts? Rather like the wonderful, little-seen New Zealand comedy horror Housebound, Eli is a haunted house film where the person being haunted is unable to leave. It\u2019s a nifty way of ensuring that a character who should otherwise be heading for the hills is forced to endure and then investigate the source of the malevolence. But are the ghosts trying to harm or help Eli? For a while there\u2019s some fun in trying to figure it all out with him and the film carefully leaves a number of possibilities dangling. It works better as a mystery than a horror with director Ciar\u00e1n Foy strangely incapable of constructing a solid fright. The film is scattered with a number of familiar horror sequences, from a couple of nasty dreams to some extended jump scares, but none of them really land. It\u2019s a mostly one-location film and, despite experience within the genre, Foy is never able to turn the house into enough of a character, it\u2019s never as frightening as it should be, atmosphere evaporating fast. The details of the plot prove more involving than the film that surrounds it, the script chugging along with speed, leading us along with curiosity at just what the film\u2019s big twist will be. When it comes, it\u2019s a decent surprise but it\u2019s confusingly, messily revealed and the film crumbles soon after, devolving into laughable silliness, almost deliberately so, as if Foy wasn\u2019t sure how to sell the finale with a straight face. Performances are mostly bland although Taylor does have some fun weaponising the soft tone of her voice. Like The Cloverfield Paradox before it, Eli is a film more suited to the small screen, where audience members can multi-task, perhaps even search for something better to watch next. Eli is available on Netflix now",

      "body": "<p>Paul Feig has a tendency to make films that are difficult to talk about until you have seen them.

Often, you leave the cinema feeling as if you have been pleasantly fooled.</p> <p>It\u2019s certainly true with Last Christmas, which the director is sitting down to talk about in early September, and which appears, based on its teaser, to be a mushy festive romcom. Naturally, it doesn\u2019t quite go where you would expect it to, which of course means we can\u2019t really talk about the film we are here to talk about. \u201cExactly,\u201d he says, smiling. He is wearing, as is his custom, an impossibly dapper three-piece suit, and he has a sweetly nervous cough/chuckle that ripples up as he speaks. \u201cA lot of the movies I do just happen to have something like that in it.

It turns out that <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Daenerys_Targaryen\" title=\"\">Daenerys Targaryen</a> is an excellent comic actor. \u201cIsn\u2019t it crazy?\u201d Feig says. A huge Game of Thrones fan, he summoned her for a meeting. \u201cI was expecting her to be very Daenerys, you know, proper: \u2018How do you do?\u2019 She comes in, and she\u2019s just funny, goofy and effervescent. I equate her in this movie to when Meg Ryan was in When Harry Met Sally. The whole country just goes: we\u2019re in love with you.\u201d</p> <p>The film is also Feig\u2019s love letter to London, where he has been living for the past year, even if it takes some geographical liberties: \u201cThey walk from the Embankment to Ally Pally [Alexandra Palace, which is several miles away]. Then they run out of Ally Pally on to the Strand! I have great guilt about that.\u201d He loves London so much that he and his wife are making plans to move here. He got involved with the film when he went for a walk with Emma Thompson on Hampstead Heath to talk about directing Mindy Kaling\u2019s Late Night, in which Thompson starred, but the timings didn\u2019t work out. However, a friendship was born. \u201cI was in the process of signing on to do a different film somewhere else, and into my inbox popped up this email from Emma, titled The Script What I Wrote, in good old Morecambe-and-Wise tradition.\u201d He always gets nervous when friends send him scripts. \u201cThe best people in the world will send me a script sometimes and you\u2019re just like: \u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019 But I read this and was completely out of my mind, and so impressed by it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"679d28e815352fa3c958264d9c4806aa8265ae23\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/679d28e815352fa3c958264d9c4806aa8265ae23/0_33_6327_3796/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Feig \u2026 \u2018Like it or not, London, you do Christmas amazingly well.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Feig \u2026 \u2018Like it or not, London, you do Christmas amazingly well.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vianney Le Caer/Invision/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is his second Christmas movie. The first, <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0488658/\" title=\"\">Unaccompanied Minors</a>, came out in 2006, but was a flop. What did he learn from it? \u201cApparently nothing,\u201d he laughs, \u201cbecause I did another Christmas film.\u201d The script, by Thompson and Bryony Kimmings, and the prospect of being in London in December tempted him back. \u201cLike it or not, London, you do Christmas amazingly well.\u201d Also, its seasonal setting means it is guaranteed to come out for Christmas, and the release won\u2019t get bumped. \u201cI\u2019m just desperate for people to see my movies,\u201d he says. Is he really worried they won\u2019t? \u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d he shrugs. \u201cEvery new movie is a chance to fail.\u201d</p> <p>Feig\u2019s film career came off the back of a hugely successful one in television. He created the cult teen series <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0193676/\" title=\"\">Freaks and Geeks</a>, produced by Judd Apatow, and he seems to have directed at least a few episodes of the greatest shows from the past two decades: Mad Men, 30 Rock, The Office, Parks and Recreation. But film was a slow starter. \u201cI had done two unsuccessful movies, one being the first Christmas movie. That really stuck me in movie jail. It lost money for the studio.\u201d Just before that one came out, he had been invited to the table read of a script that would become Bridesmaids. \u201cI remember going: \u2018Oh my God, this is what I want to do \u2013 a movie filled with all these funny women.\u2019 Then it fell away for three years. I would call Judd occasionally, and be like: \u2018Is that movie around?\u2019 And he\u2019d say: \u2018I don\u2019t think it\u2019s gonna go.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7afd609c42e9109c4a20d5a6549f1ead6c53b928\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7afd609c42e9109c4a20d5a6549f1ead6c53b928/0_30_4088_2453/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bridesmaids \u2026 \u2018Making it was terrifying.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bridesmaids \u2026 \u2018Making it was terrifying.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Feig found himself in a funk, which became apparent when he was directing an internet campaign for a department store. \u201cIt was a fun job, but one of the people I was directing was Donald Trump.\u201d He laughs, awkwardly. \u201cIt was so unnerving, and he was unnerving. He was actually a fan of The Office, so he was like: \u2018Hey, that\u2019s the guy who did The Office.\u2019 But he had such a weird energy about him. I remember being back at my hotel room and thinking: \u2018I\u2019m so far away from doing what I want to do.\u2019\u201d Then the phone rang. \u201cI got a call from my agent going, hey, I think the wedding movie is gonna go.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNppLrmdyug\" title=\"\">Bridesmaids</a> transformed his career. \u201cBut making it was terrifying. I always called it strike three, because if this one bombs, I\u2019m dead.\u201d He says there was additional pressure on it as a funny film written by and about women. \u201cIt shows how crazy and terrible the town can be, because really, they\u2019re like, before we do other movies with <em>women</em>, let\u2019s see how this one does. Would they ever say that when they\u2019re making The Hangover? Like, all right, if this men-driven movie works, we can make more of these?\u201d</p> <p>Feig has always related to women, and since Bridesmaids, all his films have had female leads. They\u2019re usually about women as outsiders; not quite managing to fit in where they are supposed to. \u201cI was an only child. I grew up next to a family of eight kids, six of whom were girls. I liked the humour of joking around with my female friends because male humour devolves, eventually, into homophobia, punching and name-calling. I\u2019d rather just have goofy fun.\u201d Later, when he was acting and directing, he was frustrated with what he was seeing on screen. \u201cI had [female] friends who were actors and comedians, and they would show up in movies and I\u2019d be, like: \u2018Oh yay, they\u2019re going to be funny. And, what, they\u2019re not funny?\u2019 I love <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/jul/16/dvdreviews\" title=\"\">School of Rock</a>, but I remember thinking: \u2018Sarah Silverman is one of the funniest people on the planet.

Can\u2019t I have fun with that?\u201d That\u2019s why he did the reboot. \u201cFor better or worse.

It also appears to influence their choices, shifting towards \u201chigh-calorie tasty foods rather than their typical anorexia very low-calorie choices\u201d.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, she says, that means patients become more relaxed around eating. One participant credited rTMS for helping to dim the \u201cpunishing thoughts and catastrophic guilt\u201d she had endured in her 30 years with anorexia.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhilst the difference is small, it is hugely significant. It has allowed me to eat morsels of food that would have not only been immediately dismissed before the therapy, they would have made me want to scream,\u201d the patient said.</p> \n<p>It is relatively early days for rTMS (which has also been <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28121991\">trialled in bulimia</a>), which the researchers emphasise currently works best alongside traditional talking therapy. A 2018 <a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/8/7/e021531\">randomised controlled trial</a> showed 45% of those with anorexia receiving real rTMS reached normal weight 18 months after the study, compared with about 10% of those who received a sham treatment.</p> \n<p>However, participant numbers were small and there was a placebo effect during treatment. \u201cOne needs to exert a degree of caution here,\u201d Schmidt says, warning about the unrealistic promises some private rTMS clinics are making to patients and families. \u201cOnly proper large-scale trials will be able to answer the question of whether the early encouraging results of rTMS treatment in anorexia nervosa hold up to further scrutiny.\u201d </p> \n<p>The huge demand for treatment, and the paucity of existing services, appear to be stimulating an array of experimentation in the field. A second \u201cneuro-hack\u201d under development involves deep brain stimulation (DBS), an established surgical procedure in <a href=\"https://www.parkinson.org/Understanding-Parkinsons/Treatment/Surgical-Treatment-Options/Deep-Brain-Stimulation\">Parkinson\u2019s</a>. Seven people with longstanding and severe anorexia have been recruited to a pilot study at the University of Oxford \u2013 preliminary results are expected towards the end of 2020.</p> \n<p>The aim, explains one of the investigators, the psychiatrist Rebecca Park, is to stimulate a brain region called the nucleus accumbens, the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25950633\">\u201c</a><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25950633\">hedonic hotspot</a><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25950633\">\u201d</a> which is central to reward processing.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn eating disorders, what is rewarding in life changes,\u201d Parks explains. \u201cIt\u2019s as if reward becomes warped towards pursuit of thinness. The eating and exercise rituals, obsessions and habits that characterise the disorder become entrenched over time.\u201d</p> \n<p>The DBS process, which can <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2018.00024/full\">trigger complications</a>, involves implanting electrodes into the brain that are linked by extension leads to an implanted pulse generator (in the form of a rechargeable pacemaker) placed beneath the skin below the collarbone.</p> \n<p>The researchers quote \u201can overall risk of stroke of less than 1%, a haemorrhage-causing death of 0.01% and a risk of wound infection of 5%\u201d. There are concerns about trialling a treatment that is so invasive and experimental without definitive data to support its use. The team\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5357647/\">ethical framework</a> will include \u201cchecks and balances at all stages, supported by an independent ethicist who will act as a patient advocate\u201d.</p> \n<p>Park concedes \u201cthere is a risk of instilling false hope, as DBS is not a magic bullet and is unlikely to help everyone\u201d. Nevertheless she believes that evaluating it ethically for anorexia is a step in the right direction.\u201d</p> \n<p>A third group of researchers based in Barcelona are innovating in a completely different space: a video game with built-in biofeedback that rewards emotional control.</p> \n<p>On a virtual tropical island, gamers enjoy sun and sand before experiencing tumultuous storms.

      "body": "<p>There is a narrative that generational warfare is increasingly common in our divided world: the Brexit schism of older leavers and young remainers; the middle-aged property investors whose mortgages are paid by generation rent. Then there\u2019s the explosion of tech and shifting cultural values that lead to head-scratching and eye-rolling; each generation bitches about the one below it, we\u2019re told, treating the one above with an unfair disdain. But this is not something I recognise in my own life. I have some brilliant friends, and I count myself especially fortunate that they are from all generations.</p> <p>I had my 30th birthday in August, which I freaked out about in a way I did not expect; but it was glorious to see so many pals together in one place. I can\u2019t remember any other recent setting where people with decades between them were introducing themselves, chatting and drinking: 60-year-old mates asking a mid-20s couple who they vote for; two football fans, one born the year the other went to his first game, aged 19; me, being mocked by some people for being ridiculously young, and by others for being \u201cancient now\u201d.</p> <p>Having friends from a single age group is like going to an ice-cream parlour, ordering three scoops, and picking the same flavour for each. Here\u2019s a guide to what makes my friends from each generation special. As the great R&amp;B philosopher Aaliyah said: age ain\u2019t nothing but a number.</p> <h2>The silent generation: \u2018They can dole out advice about what matters in life and what really, really doesn\u2019t\u2019</h2> <p>You may not have come across the term \u201csilent generation\u201d, but that makes it all the more apt. The <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/03/16/how-millennials-compare-with-their-grandparents/\" title=\"\">Pew Research Center</a> defines its members as being born between 1928 and 1945 \u2013 a time when children, their parents struggling through the Great Depression and the second world war, were expected to be seen and not heard, and when individuals came of age in an period of austerity.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The mid-70s crew at the Hampstead Ladies\u2019 Pond can dole out advice about what matters and what really, really doesn\u2019t</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I don\u2019t have lots of friends who fall into this category. But I have a few \u2013 enough for me to quibble with the \u201csilent\u201d description. The best thing about the mid-70s crew that hang out at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/jun/16/the-ladies-pond-deborah-moggach-so-mayer-and-margaret-drabble-dive-in\" title=\"\">Hampstead Ladies\u2019 Pond</a> in north London, for instance, is that they have experienced so much, and can dole out advice about what matters in life and what really, really doesn\u2019t. A lot of this wisdom is shared while naked, tits akimbo (appearance is one of the things that I am reliably informed does not matter).</p> <p>The other pals in this age range I have collected from places where age is disregarded \u2013 when travelling or in psychiatric wards (mosquito attacks and mental breakdown are both great levellers). A shoutout here to Nancy, a mid-70s expat artist who nursed me through a horrid cold in her casbah on the Morocco-Algeria border.</p> <h2>The baby boomers: \u2018We hang out at their houses because of the sash windows and the Agas that warm the kitchens\u2019</h2> <p>It has been estimated that boomers (born between 1946\u20131964) are 17 times wealthier than my generation, the millennials.

      "bodyText": "There is a narrative that generational warfare is increasingly common in our divided world: the Brexit schism of older leavers and young remainers; the middle-aged property investors whose mortgages are paid by generation rent. Then there\u2019s the explosion of tech and shifting cultural values that lead to head-scratching and eye-rolling; each generation bitches about the one below it, we\u2019re told, treating the one above with an unfair disdain. But this is not something I recognise in my own life. I have some brilliant friends, and I count myself especially fortunate that they are from all generations. I had my 30th birthday in August, which I freaked out about in a way I did not expect; but it was glorious to see so many pals together in one place. I can\u2019t remember any other recent setting where people with decades between them were introducing themselves, chatting and drinking: 60-year-old mates asking a mid-20s couple who they vote for; two football fans, one born the year the other went to his first game, aged 19; me, being mocked by some people for being ridiculously young, and by others for being \u201cancient now\u201d. Having friends from a single age group is like going to an ice-cream parlour, ordering three scoops, and picking the same flavour for each. Here\u2019s a guide to what makes my friends from each generation special. As the great R&amp;B philosopher Aaliyah said: age ain\u2019t nothing but a number. The silent generation: \u2018They can dole out advice about what matters in life and what really, really doesn\u2019t\u2019 You may not have come across the term \u201csilent generation\u201d, but that makes it all the more apt. The Pew Research Center defines its members as being born between 1928 and 1945 \u2013 a time when children, their parents struggling through the Great Depression and the second world war, were expected to be seen and not heard, and when individuals came of age in an period of austerity. I don\u2019t have lots of friends who fall into this category. But I have a few \u2013 enough for me to quibble with the \u201csilent\u201d description. The best thing about the mid-70s crew that hang out at the Hampstead Ladies\u2019 Pond in north London, for instance, is that they have experienced so much, and can dole out advice about what matters in life and what really, really doesn\u2019t. A lot of this wisdom is shared while naked, tits akimbo (appearance is one of the things that I am reliably informed does not matter). The other pals in this age range I have collected from places where age is disregarded \u2013 when travelling or in psychiatric wards (mosquito attacks and mental breakdown are both great levellers). A shoutout here to Nancy, a mid-70s expat artist who nursed me through a horrid cold in her casbah on the Morocco-Algeria border. The baby boomers: \u2018We hang out at their houses because of the sash windows and the Agas that warm the kitchens\u2019 It has been estimated that boomers (born between 1946\u20131964) are 17 times wealthier than my generation, the millennials. If intergenerational tensions were to come into play, it would most likely be with this cohort. However, it actually works out well: for example, when my boomer friends offer to get more rounds in, or waive theatre ticket reimbursements. We mostly hang out at their houses, because of the beautifully restored sash windows and the Agas that warm the kitchens. One benefit of having friends who were teens or young adults when some of my favourite music and art was produced is hearing their tales; why listen to Q magazine-reading lads at house parties bang on about Dylan going electric when I have friends who were actually there, or who rushed out to buy Joy Division\u2019s Unknown Pleasures on its release? People in this age group are often embarking on new stages in their own lives: retiring or divorcing, their kids leaving for university or the world of work. There is a mutual bond of: \u201cWhat the hell are we going to do with our lives?\u201d Also good for: borrowing books and long walks in nature; debating everything; and shamefully crying on their shoulders. Generation X: \u2018Their kids, if they have them, are old enough not to be boring\u2019 Perhaps half of my social circle (and a significant number of exes) come from this group, usually defined as born between 1965 to 1980. Criticised in their youth for being directionless slackers, as exemplified in Richard Linklater\u2019s 1991 film, um, Slacker, perhaps they sympathise with the slurs aimed at my generation. My Gen X friends are great fun. On the rare occasions when they have babysitters, they grab the opportunity to come out for prosecco and to grill me about my life, which mostly they imagine to be more exciting than it is.

Commenting on the IDC report, Asmita Naik, co-author of research published in 2002 that exposed sexual abuse by aid workers in west Africa, said: \u201cUntil these organisations are prepared to speak up and be honest, how on earth do they expect victims on the ground to do so? At the moment, they are still too defensive, too secretive.\u201d She added: \u201cWhere\u2019s the sense of urgency? Where are the changes on the ground? It still seems stuck at that top level policy. That is where it has been for years.\u201d A DfID spokesperson said: \u201cWe will continue to take robust action and are making sure UK aid doesn\u2019t go to organisations who fall short of our expected standards.\u201d Stephanie Draper, CEO of Bond, said: \u201cWe value the IDC\u2019s commitment to working with all sectors and DfID to improve safeguarding practices. However, it is a shame that months of hard work from the NGO sector to up its game across a wide range of aspects of safeguarding seems to have been overlooked in the committee\u2019s report.\u201d",

In this hot weather it is harder for them to grow,\u201d admits Mistry, his arms crossed over his bare chest. \u201cIf the salinity increases the shrimp will not die, but production will decrease. But if the heat increases, the shrimp will die.\u201d Today the crippling temperatures are one of the shrimp farmers\u2019 biggest concerns. Mistry is all too aware of the precarious situation of his trade, and watchful for the next problem that could bring the industry to its knees \u2013 as happened 20 years ago, when white spot disease spread through the farms, brought on by the increased levels of salt. During the crisis, farmers noticed that mud crabs were naturally invading the decimated shrimp ponds, and seized the opportunity for some marginal returns. As a result, some deserted their old stocks and switched to crab cultivation instead. Although still nascent and smaller than the now recovered shrimp industry, Bangladesh\u2019s crab production has proved a success story. With rising international demand from countries such as China, Singapore and Malaysia, the export of mud crab from the south Asian nation reached $24m (\u00a319m) in 2015\u201316. Now the area\u2019s aquaculture is divided between shrimp and soft-shell crab farming, and collecting wild mud crabs from the Sundarbans for export, or to be fattened up in local farms. Yet the irony is that amid a shift to a more climatically resilient industry, those on its frontline, the fishermen who venture into the mangrove forest, find themselves more and more at risk. Kidnappings \u2018up to once a week\u2019 For years, small pirate gangs have roamed the watery capillaries of the Sundarbans, hiding out in the dense forest as they stake out fishermen to kidnap and hold for ransom. There are a few horror stories \u2013 of fishermen being severely beaten, or having their Achilles tendons sliced \u2013 but for the most part the piratical target is financial. As soon as they capture a victim, the pirates head for areas within the forest known for the best cell reception, sometimes climbing trees for a clear line, so they can call a terrified victim\u2019s family to demand a ransom via electronic transfer. So organised are some they even have their own business cards. \u201cIt\u2019s so stressful when the men get kidnapped,\u201d exclaims Shefali Bibi, a pickle maker and fisherman\u2019s wife from Datina Khali, dressed in a bright yellow and purple sari. \u201cThose are the worst days. I can\u2019t eat, or sleep or bathe.\u201d In the past decade, pirates have twice kidnapped her husband and held him for ransom, each time causing immense financial strain. Of about 1,600 fishermen and crab collectors in Datina Khali, almost all have been kidnapped once \u2013 others up to four or five times. To address the rampant banditry, the government has in recent years launched a huge crackdown, offering pirates lucrative sums to surrender. Roughly 29 pirate groups brandishing more than 400 firearms have given themselves up since 2015, with the last batch reportedly surrendering in November 2018, when the Bangladeshi prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, declared the Unesco-listed Sundarbans \u201cpirate free\u201d. But while the situation is significantly better, local fishermen say there are at least three pirate gangs still operating, with kidnappings occurring up to once a week. \u201cThere are fewer pirate groups now, but the situation is unchanged. If they find us we still have to pay them,\u201d says 32-year-old Moniral Islam Gazi, a crab collector who was captured this April. \u201cI am not really scared of being caught because I have faced it a lot, but I am scared about where to find the money.\u201d If pirates capture them as they eke out a meagre existence collecting mud crabs and wild honey, they are quickly plunged into vicious cycles of debt. Back in the village, when a family member receives a ransom call they are thrust into a state of panic. Most have little, if any, savings. With payments ranging anywhere from 20,000 to 250,000 Bangladeshi taka (\u00a3182 \u2013 \u00a32,270), many are forced to take loans. Of almost half a dozen crab collectors interviewed, all but one had a loan. Many had multiple loans, from local businessmen, village loan sharks and microcredit agencies. \u201cSometimes they need a loan just to pay for their forest permit and supplies,\u201d explains Srikander Ali, a local crab broker at the nearby Katakhali fish market, who reckons the kidnappings still occur between eight and 10 times a month. \u201cI also give them loans for the ransoms. If they get caught it affects my business too,\u201d he says, glancing at baskets of wriggling mud crab stacked against the wall, soon to be trucked to Dhaka for live export. \u201cI estimate that about 80% are in a pretty bad financial position.\u201d \u2018A lot of fear factors\u2019 Sitting opposite her husband in their canoe, as he gently scoops up his line from the khaki waters, Henna Bibi is pragmatic about her choices. \u201cThere are a lot of fear factors in the forest,\u201d she says. \u201cBut if we get scared we won\u2019t be able to raise our children.\u201d For safety, they set out into the forest in numbers. But these days there is also the problem of supply \u2013 once bountiful, wild mud crabs are becoming increasingly hard to find. \u201cThe number of crabs has dropped noticeably in the last six years,\u201d says Muhammad Didar Boxfaksis, 65. \u201cOn a good day, we can get 5\u20137kg, but 15 years ago it was double that.\u201d \u201cWe used to throw the smaller crabs back,\u201d agrees his neighbour, Sobed Ali. \u201cNow, we take everything we can find.\u201d Mojibar Rahman, who is researching a PhD on crab cultivation at the Bangladesh Agricultural University, says the shortage is likely to result from over-collection. To make the industry more sustainable, the government needs to invest in mud-crab hatcheries, he suggests, instead of being almost entirely reliant on wild stocks. \u201cThe crab industry is still underdeveloped because of a lack of culture technology and a lack of seeds [baby crabs],\u201d he explains, adding that some farmers have also shied away from crab cultivation because, in the Muslim-majority nation, crabs are viewed as haram (forbidden). With the myriad challenges before them, some local fishermen are looking for a way out. Many of the younger men have already left, seeking work in urban brick factories. The older fishermen claim that if it weren\u2019t for the pirates they would make more than enough, but Sobed Ali is tired of waiting, and luckily has a small amount of money to invest in adapting his business. \u201cThe money I make, I don\u2019t end up using it myself, it ends up as pirate bail,\u201d says the exasperated father of three. \u201cIt makes my life miserable.\u201d With their savings from harvesting crab and selling pickles, and a loan from a Japanese trading company, Ali and his wife have converted a piece of land they own in the village into a small soft-shell crab farm. \u201cI have to secure my children\u2019s future, so that\u2019s why I am starting the soft-shell crab farming,\u201d says Ali, as he hammers together an adjacent shelter in the fading light. \u201cI don\u2019t want my sons to go into the forest like me. It\u2019s too risky. Hopefully, if this goes well, I can stop going in too.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "For decades, consumers worldwide have named the $347bn pharmaceutical behemoth Johnson &amp; Johnson as one of its most trusted brands. The company returned the favor, instilling its commitment to corporate social responsibility in a 75-year-old \u201ccredo\u201d inscribed at company headquarters. \u201cWe believe our first responsibility is to the patients, doctors and nurses, to mothers and fathers and all others who use our products and services. In meeting their needs everything we do must be of high quality.\u201d The company has been a household name for more than 100 years with a reassuringly cozy image as the quintessential family brand of baby powder, baby shampoo and the maker of Band-Aids. But it is also the name behind a huge range of drugs and medical devices. And in recent years it has been clobbered by lawsuits and huge payouts involving a dizzying array of products, from an anti-psychotic drug to that famous talcum powder and even a patented opium poppy called Norman. Now, experts are concerned that one of the world\u2019s most recognizable names and most reliable and valuable companies is caught in no less than an existential crisis, and the public is asking: what happened to Johnson &amp; Johnson? A series of product misfires and court judgments \u2013 with a potential 50,000 more to come and total potential liabilities of $15bn \u2013 is challenging both public trust and investor faith. The pharma giant has seen its reputation drop steadily from ninth place to 57th out of 58 leading pharmaceutical companies since 2014, according to one study by the UK reputation intelligence company Alva. Last week a jury in Philadelphia awarded $8bn in punitive damages to a man claiming that the company did not warn young men that taking its anti-psychotic drug Risperdal could cause them to grow breasts. After the judgment, which the company said it plans to appeal, lawyers for the plaintiff said: \u201cJohnson &amp; Johnson is a company which has lost its way\u201d and the jury had chosen to impose punitive damages \u201con a corporation that valued profits over safety and profits over patients\u201d. Meanwhile, Johnson &amp; Johnson went through five years of litigation over claims it failed to warn customers that its blood-thinner Xarelto increased the risk of internal bleeding. In March, Johnson &amp; Johnson and co-maker Bayer agreed to pay $775m to settle about 25,000 lawsuits, though neither of the companies admitted liability. In July, Johnson &amp; Johnson asked a judge in Trenton, New Jersey, to dismiss as many as 14,000 lawsuits alleging its talc-based baby powder causes ovarian cancer. According to the complaints, which have been moving through the legal system since 1999, the company failed to inform the FDA that at least three tests by three different labs from 1972 to 1975 had found asbestos in its talc \u2013 in one case at levels reported as \u201crather high\u201d. Previous efforts to settle the cases have had mixed results and last year, a Missouri jury ordered Johnson &amp; Johnson to pay $4.69bn to 22 women. Johnson &amp; Johnson says its baby powder is safe and does not cause cancer. And on Thursday, the company agreed to a $117m multi-state US settlement over allegations it deceptively marketed its pelvic mesh products, which support women\u2019s prolapsed pelvic organs, but allegedly caused many cases of bleeding, pain and infections. An investigation concluded that the company violated state consumer protection laws by not fully disclosing the devices\u2019 risks. But none of those risk as much discomfort as the company\u2019s role in the US opioids crisis, which has claimed 400,000 lives. Earlier this month, it settled a major lawsuit in a significant climbdown over its prescription painkiller business, just weeks before a multibillion-dollar trial over the public health epidemic. Johnson &amp; Johnson agreed to pay two Ohio counties a total of $20m to avoid the first in a series of federal trials testing whether opioid painkiller manufacturers, distributors and pharmacy chains are culpable for the worst drug crisis in US history. Although the settlement was relatively small, it potentially opens the door to payouts totaling billions of dollars to 2,000-plus other counties, municipalities and Native American tribes suing over the damage caused by the crisis. Dozens of states are also suing. This all follows a ruling in August when the company lost a civil trial over opioids, where a court in Oklahoma ordered it to pay $572m to the state. The judgment, considered a bellwether, was a defeat for the company on principle but was welcomed by investors who had feared an award as high as $2bn. The company said it would appeal against the ruling. While Johnson &amp; Johnson\u2019s stock rose 2% after the verdict, the judgment presented a public relations problem for the company. In addition to selling Duragesic fentanyl patches through a subsidiary, Johnson &amp; Johnson had earned richly as a leading supplier of the opioid in Purdue Pharma\u2019s prescription painkiller OxyContin, developing a special strain of poppy, called Norman, in its opium fields in Australia. The Johnson family are no longer major stakeholders in the company founded by Robert Wood Johnson in 1886, but the family interest is still valued at $6.3bn, putting them at #46 on Forbes\u2019 richest families list. Senior patriarch Woody Johnson is the US ambassador to the Court of St James in Britain. But the family has avoided personal opprobrium, unlike billionaire members of the Sackler family who own Purdue Pharma and have been personally sued and targeted by direct action protests over their philanthropy, led by the American art photographer Nan Goldin. \u201cMy problem with Johnson &amp; Johnson is that they did not give appropriate information with regard to the opioids they were distributing,\u201d says Gail Box, whose son Austin was a University of Oklahoma football star who was prescribed opioid painkillers after back surgery and died of an overdose aged 22. \u201cJohnson &amp; Johnson were not upfront about the risks,\u201d says Box, whose husband Craig testified at the Oklahoma trial. \u201cThey said possibly 1% of people taking opioids would become addicted when they knew the number was far greater.\u201d The opioids and Risperdal cases have meant a rough 2019 for Johnson &amp; Johnson. \u201cThe company has cultivated this reputation as this family-friendly, public-minded company, but these cases suggest otherwise,\u201d said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond. \u201cSo there\u2019s a huge public relations problem \u2026 there are 14,000 other cases involved with Risperdal, 15,000 talc cases, 25,000 pelvic mesh cases and possibly thousands of opioid-related lawsuits to follow. They can\u2019t litigate all of them, so are they going to settle?\u201d Looking back to the 1980s, says crisis management expert Bill Moran, Johnson &amp; Johnson set the standards for corporate responsibility with its swift handling of the crisis when cyanide-laced Tylenol (the company\u2019s branded paracetamol) killed seven in a bottle-tampering spree, quickly withdrawing the product and redesigning the bottle amid a public awareness campaign. But now, Moran said: \u201cWith so many legal judgments against them they\u2019re facing an existential crisis.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The American people are tired of war. After 18 years of continuous conflict \u2013 so long that fathers and sons have fought in the same war \u2013 fatigue and frustration with the exercise of US military force abroad pervade our political culture. This is not new. Nominally anti-war candidates have won the past three presidential elections. Indeed, one of the many perverse features of the 2016 campaign was that the strongest denunciation of the 2003 US invasion of Iraq came not from the Democrat on the debate stage but from Donald Trump. So seemingly indifferent to the painful toll of endless war was Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign that it could very well have <a href=\"https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=604064031098125109079115071067073103018051001046052028106016015094007105078112018069062043121044102001042025083008120101085106024070038021022093074101026000064118123001069095127087006101007076098074066019080107100106123104117065085026093001006092019127&amp;EXT=pdf\">cost her the election</a>.</p> <p>Trump, of course, did not campaign as a principled anti-interventionist or anti-imperialist but as an amoral dealmaker, willing to pull the US out of entanglements deemed too costly or arrangements with allies deemed ungrateful. Yet he has governed, at least for the bulk of his term, much more like a conventional Republican than the flouter of the bipartisan foreign policy consensus he sometimes postured to be. Hawkish generals, neocons and hardcore Islamophobes have largely occupied the key policy-making positions in his administration. Instead of \u201cending endless wars\u201d, as he has periodically pledged to do, Trump has mostly done the opposite: <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/16/us/politics/trump-veto-yemen.html\">vetoing in April</a> a resolution that would have ended US military involvement in the Saudi-led war in Yemen; <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/us-to-send-additional-troops-to-saudi-arabia-to-boost-defenses-against-iran/2019/10/11/7b8c8de6-ec42-11e9-9c6d-436a0df4f31d_story.html\">expanding US military presence</a> in Saudi Arabia; and repeatedly risking armed conflict with Iran.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/14/trump-troops-syria-leave-iraq-afghanistan-us\">Trump is right to take troops out of Syria. Now they must leave Iraq and Afghanistan | Simon Jenkins</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is a sad irony that Trump\u2019s recent catastrophic decision to withdraw US troops from north-eastern Syria and approve Turkey\u2019s invasion may be the closest his administration has come to substantially contravening the foreign policy establishment\u2019s dictates and actually reducing US military presence abroad. The withdrawal from Syria is the exact opposite of principled anti-interventionism: incoherent, inconsistent and likely to imperil already vulnerable progressive and democratic forces. As <a href=\"https://www.dissentmagazine.org/online_articles/trumps-betrayal-of-rojava\">Meredith Tax writes</a>, it is a colossal betrayal of the Kurds, many of whom have fought and died alongside US troops trying to expel the Islamic State from their territory, and a terrible blow to the revolutionary experiment in Rojava, which has offered the international left a glimpse of a new political paradigm in practice.</p> <p>An unstrategic, chaotic move that has already taken innocent people\u2019s lives, Trump\u2019s Syria withdrawal should be a warning to those too easily seduced by the president\u2019s erratic opposition to US foreign involvement \u2013 an orientation grounded in the mercenary logic of the protection racket, not respect for international law or a commitment to human rights. It is crucial not to confuse the president\u2019s cruel calculus with a genuine commitment to ending protracted wars, regardless of what he might tweet.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is crucial not to confuse the president\u2019s cruel calculus with a genuine commitment to ending protracted wars, regardless of what he might tweet</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Trump\u2019s Syria withdrawal should also serve as a reminder to liberals and leftists of the urgent need to articulate a strong alternative to the policies of imperial maintenance \u2013 a swollen defense budget, drone strikes and targeted assassinations \u2013 advocated by Democrats and Republicans alike as well as to the cruel, cynical foreign policy of Trump.</p> <p>This is a moral imperative: not only in light of US imperial maintenance\u2019s direct human cost, felt most acutely by those whose countries and societies have been torn apart by US invasion or intervention, but also in light of what could be accomplished domestically by taking the substantial resources currently used to end lives abroad and reallocating them to improve and save lives at home through reinvestments in the country\u2019s fraying social safety net.</p> <p>And, in the midst of a presidential election campaign, it is a political imperative. Trump\u2019s re-election campaign may be mired in scandal and seemingly disorganized, but there is no doubt that Trump and his operatives understand the electoral benefits of an anti-interventionist posture; it worked for them before, and it could work for them again. The Syrian withdrawal should be understood with this in mind, as should Trump\u2019s proposed drawdown of US troops from Afghanistan. After all, the places where it matters that loved ones have returned from active duty are places where the Democratic nominee will need to win if Trump is to be defeated.</p> <p>They will fail to do so if the Democratic foreign policy position is characterized by kneejerk defensiveness about the Obama administration\u2019s foreign policy legacy (eg Joe Biden) or the pabulum of \u201cAmerican leadership\u201d (eg Pete Buttigieg) that, in practice, means sending more US soldiers, and civilians, in countries around the world, to their deaths.</p> <p>Instead, the Democrats must put forward a vision of US foreign policy that pairs a principled opposition to endless wars with a commitment to begin a responsible, comprehensive pullback of US military presence abroad. Fears of a possible backlash to this are probably overstated. In ways not always intelligible as such, a war-weary people demands a respite.</p> <ul> <li><p>Joshua Leifer is an associate editor at Dissent</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "The American people are tired of war. After 18 years of continuous conflict \u2013 so long that fathers and sons have fought in the same war \u2013 fatigue and frustration with the exercise of US military force abroad pervade our political culture. This is not new. Nominally anti-war candidates have won the past three presidential elections. Indeed, one of the many perverse features of the 2016 campaign was that the strongest denunciation of the 2003 US invasion of Iraq came not from the Democrat on the debate stage but from Donald Trump. So seemingly indifferent to the painful toll of endless war was Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign that it could very well have cost her the election. Trump, of course, did not campaign as a principled anti-interventionist or anti-imperialist but as an amoral dealmaker, willing to pull the US out of entanglements deemed too costly or arrangements with allies deemed ungrateful. Yet he has governed, at least for the bulk of his term, much more like a conventional Republican than the flouter of the bipartisan foreign policy consensus he sometimes postured to be. Hawkish generals, neocons and hardcore Islamophobes have largely occupied the key policy-making positions in his administration. Instead of \u201cending endless wars\u201d, as he has periodically pledged to do, Trump has mostly done the opposite: vetoing in April a resolution that would have ended US military involvement in the Saudi-led war in Yemen; expanding US military presence in Saudi Arabia; and repeatedly risking armed conflict with Iran. It is a sad irony that Trump\u2019s recent catastrophic decision to withdraw US troops from north-eastern Syria and approve Turkey\u2019s invasion may be the closest his administration has come to substantially contravening the foreign policy establishment\u2019s dictates and actually reducing US military presence abroad. The withdrawal from Syria is the exact opposite of principled anti-interventionism: incoherent, inconsistent and likely to imperil already vulnerable progressive and democratic forces. As Meredith Tax writes, it is a colossal betrayal of the Kurds, many of whom have fought and died alongside US troops trying to expel the Islamic State from their territory, and a terrible blow to the revolutionary experiment in Rojava, which has offered the international left a glimpse of a new political paradigm in practice. An unstrategic, chaotic move that has already taken innocent people\u2019s lives, Trump\u2019s Syria withdrawal should be a warning to those too easily seduced by the president\u2019s erratic opposition to US foreign involvement \u2013 an orientation grounded in the mercenary logic of the protection racket, not respect for international law or a commitment to human rights. It is crucial not to confuse the president\u2019s cruel calculus with a genuine commitment to ending protracted wars, regardless of what he might tweet. Trump\u2019s Syria withdrawal should also serve as a reminder to liberals and leftists of the urgent need to articulate a strong alternative to the policies of imperial maintenance \u2013 a swollen defense budget, drone strikes and targeted assassinations \u2013 advocated by Democrats and Republicans alike as well as to the cruel, cynical foreign policy of Trump. This is a moral imperative: not only in light of US imperial maintenance\u2019s direct human cost, felt most acutely by those whose countries and societies have been torn apart by US invasion or intervention, but also in light of what could be accomplished domestically by taking the substantial resources currently used to end lives abroad and reallocating them to improve and save lives at home through reinvestments in the country\u2019s fraying social safety net. And, in the midst of a presidential election campaign, it is a political imperative. Trump\u2019s re-election campaign may be mired in scandal and seemingly disorganized, but there is no doubt that Trump and his operatives understand the electoral benefits of an anti-interventionist posture; it worked for them before, and it could work for them again. The Syrian withdrawal should be understood with this in mind, as should Trump\u2019s proposed drawdown of US troops from Afghanistan. After all, the places where it matters that loved ones have returned from active duty are places where the Democratic nominee will need to win if Trump is to be defeated. They will fail to do so if the Democratic foreign policy position is characterized by kneejerk defensiveness about the Obama administration\u2019s foreign policy legacy (eg Joe Biden) or the pabulum of \u201cAmerican leadership\u201d (eg Pete Buttigieg) that, in practice, means sending more US soldiers, and civilians, in countries around the world, to their deaths. Instead, the Democrats must put forward a vision of US foreign policy that pairs a principled opposition to endless wars with a commitment to begin a responsible, comprehensive pullback of US military presence abroad. Fears of a possible backlash to this are probably overstated. In ways not always intelligible as such, a war-weary people demands a respite. Joshua Leifer is an associate editor at Dissent",

Johnson\u2019s deal differs principally from Theresa May\u2019s by swapping the Irish border \u201cbackstop\u201d for a four-year customs alignment between Northern Ireland and the EU. Northern Ireland would be legally in the UK customs territory but practically in the EU customs unions. A complex mechanism would allow the Stormont power-sharing assembly to vote after four years to extend or end the alignment. Without the DUP\u2019s 10 MPs, Johnson is likely to need the support of some Labour MPs and the 21 Tory rebels he expelled from the parliamentary party in September.

Lunchtime read: \u2018We can\u2019t afford to go back to the bad old days\u2019 As Boris Johnson pursues a \u201cborder in the Irish Sea\u201d to get a Brexit deal with the EU, Rory Carroll asks the leaders and citizens of Northern Ireland what they think. \u201cA number of unionists and loyalists are angry, but the political process needs to take their fears away,\u201d said Billy Hutchinson, a Belfast city councillor with the Progressive Unionist party (PUP), which is aligned with the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) paramilitary group. \u201cIt\u2019s not the time to ratchet all this up. We can\u2019t afford to go back to the bad old days. We won\u2019t.\u201d \u201cThere seems little appetite for mass unruly protest,\u201d Carroll writes. \u201cUnionism is divided over Brexit: 47% of pro-union voters voted remain in the 2016 referendum. And there is a collective weariness, a desire to move on.\u201d Shoppers interviewed on Belfast\u2019s Shankill Road, where murals commemorate the Queen and loyalist paramilitaries, said they disapproved of a sea border but did not plan to mount any barricades. \u201cYou\u2019re not necessarily that happy with it but you want something that works for everyone,\u201d said one woman. Peter Shirlow, unionism expert at the University of Liverpool, said: \u201cA lorry sitting in Larne having its contents checked won\u2019t drive them back to violence. The narrative is changing. Northern Ireland is not as dysfunctional as you think.\u201d Sport Eddie Jones has urged England to channel the samurai spirit for their Rugby World Cup quarter-final against Australia on Saturday after springing a huge surprise by dropping George Ford and restoring the out-of-sorts Owen Farrell to fly-half. Jones\u2019s opposite number, Michael Cheika, has selected 19-year-old Jordan Petaia at outside-centre \u2013 the youngest player to start there in a World Cup \u2013 but says he trusts him \u201cinfinitely\u201d. Ed Woodward believes the perception he and other non-experts are making decisions over football policy at Manchester United is \u201cinsulting\u201d, though the executive vice-chairman admits recruitment strategy was dysfunctional in the wake of Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s retirement. England\u2019s spinners will be able to draw on local knowledge in New Zealand after Jeetan Patel, the former international who captains Warwickshire, was hired on a short-term coaching deal. In an interview with the Guardian, Sean and Matty Longstaff, Newcastle\u2019s midfield brothers, have discussed their different paths to the first team, Matty\u2019s debut goal against Manchester United and why their family could rival the Nevilles. The former England footballer Paul Gascoigne has been found not guilty of sexually assaulting a woman he kissed without consent on a train. And the Lawn Tennis Association faces questions over abuse reform after Martin Corrie, its former president who resigned last month, was nominated for prestigious re\u2011election to the board of the International Tennis Federation. Business China\u2019s economic growth slowed more than expected to 6.0% year on year in the third quarter, the weakest pace in more than 27 years, as demand at home and abroad faltered amid a bruising Sino-US trade war. Japanese shares inched higher after high-tech companies jumped on upbeat earnings from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC). The pound traded near a five-month high against the dollar and the euro after the Brexit deal between Boris Johnson and the EU. Sterling is worth around $1.285 and \u20ac1.155 at the moment while the FTSE is lower prior to the open. The papers We have a separate, full roundup of the papers today \u2013 our usual summary follows. Johnson\u2019s progress in getting his deal features on the front pages today, though most papers make it clear that this is not a done deal. The Times says: \u201cFinal hurdle in sight as Johnson gets his deal\u201d, while the Guardian reports: \u201cJohnson gets his Brexit deal \u2013 now it\u2019s a numbers game\u201d. The Mirror says: \u201cOn the brink of Brexit \u2026 once again\u201d, the i has: \u201cJohnson gets his EU deal \u2013 now for the tricky part\u201d and the FT says \u201cDUP veto threat leaves Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal gamble in the balance\u201d. Other papers are sounding warnings to MPs to vote for the deal. The Telegraph quotes from the prime minister: \u201cIt\u2019s my deal or no deal\u201d, the Daily Mail features a picture of Johnson pointing, with the headline: \u201cHe\u2019s done his duty. Now MPs must do theirs\u201d, the Sun strikes a rhyme: \u201cGet real \u2026 take the deal\u201d and the Express says: \u201cJust do it!\u201d Sign up The Guardian Morning Briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes bright and early every weekday.

In contrast, the catacombs take up no existing land. \u201cOur plan is 50 metres below existing graveyard,\u201d said Alphandary. \u201cWe are, in a way, creating new grounds for burial.\u201d The current project has taken up just 5% of the available space in the mountain, and that is just at one level. \u201cLet\u2019s think a bit further,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s say a hundred years from now all these graves will be filled. All we have to do is go another 50 metres below and we are potentially ready for another 20 times what we\u2019ve done here. \u201cDon\u2019t waste the upper area for things you can do underground.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter",

Following a reading of The Cavalcade in Keegan\u2019s deliciously Dublin accent, Rooney and Keegan discuss how, as fellow authors, they decide how much to reveal to the reader. If you want to hear some of Ireland\u2019s most exciting young writers talking excitedly about writing, this one\u2019s for you. MS",

He switches off the music. \u201cAll right,\u201d he says. \u201cLet\u2019s talk our shit.\u201d</p> <p>Ahead of this interview, I watch<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1cm3RT8f5s\" title=\"\"> YouTube footage of LaBeouf\u2019s 2017 arrest for public drunkenness in Savannah, Georgia</a>. Physically, he looks much the same now, beard and T-shirt and worked-on upper arms. Then I watch <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/film/reviews/article-the-wonderful-twain-indebted-peanut-butter-falcon-is-anchored-by/\" title=\"\">The Peanut Butter Falcon</a>, the film he was making at the time. It stars Gottsagen as a young man with Down\u2019s syndrome who goes on the run from the retirement home he has been placed in by the state, joining a fugitive fisherman played by LaBeouf on an escape along the eastern seaboard. The result \u2013 charming, Mark Twain-ish \u2013 was the sleeper hit of the US summer. For Gottsagen, 34, the bustle of interviews and film festivals is something new. LaBeouf, 33, is less excited. \u201cI\u2019ve been on this rollercoaster several times,\u201d he says. \u201cSo the only way for it to be fun is to do it with someone who has never been on it before.\u201d</p> <p>Gottsagen has been acting in amateur plays since he was a child, inspired by Grease and Hairspray, with a striking gift as a performer. In the film, he and LaBeouf play off each other beautifully. \u201cI always wanted to do acting to express my feelings and also to show people my abilities,\u201d he says. He met writer-directors Tyler Nilson and Mike Schwartz at a California film-making camp for actors with and without disabilities. The three resolved to make a feature to showcase Gottsagen \u2013 a herculean task given their lack of industry connections.</p> <p>For a time, Nilson pitched the project while living in a tent in LA. When the idea did reach executives, the conversations ended when Nilson said that it would star an actual actor with Down\u2019s. Finally, with a modest budget at last in place, the trio\u2019s \u201cproof-of-concept\u201d video was sent to LaBeouf. It was April 2017, the actor en route to a performance art project \u2013 a month alone in a remote Lapland cabin, from where he watched the video over and over.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"affebeb02a4dbf1ebd6c3aa6051a5ea83904fe3f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/affebeb02a4dbf1ebd6c3aa6051a5ea83904fe3f/0_117_3648_2190/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gottsagen and LaBeouf in The Peanut Butter Falcon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gottsagen and LaBeouf in The Peanut Butter Falcon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Seth Johnson/Signature/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There was, LaBeouf says, a sense of truth to Gottsagen on screen he was desperate to act opposite. \u201cI knew I\u2019d be playing bass to his lead.\u201d Did the novelty of a supporting role come as a relief? He is shaking his head before I\u2019ve finished the question. \u201cNot <em>novelty</em>. Novelty\u2019s a shit word. There\u2019s no novelty to Base jumping. Right? There\u2019s no novelty to skydiving. Novelty is safe. This didn\u2019t feel safe.\u201d There is a long moment of eye contact. \u201cThis felt like lighting yourself on fire.\u201d</p> <p>I ask Gottsagen if he knew about his co-star before the film, and he nods and lists the hits of the chipper first act of the Shia LaBeouf story \u2013 the sitcom <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2XmwPmqbE\" title=\"\">Even Stevens</a> he starred in at 14, the Transformers movies, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.

He describes returning to the US after a lonely month in Lapland to meet Gottsagen for the first time, the pair driven by van to Georgia to start preparing for the shoot. LaBeouf, skittish and talkative, was disarmed by his co-star\u2019s silence. Eventually, they held hands. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve looked at this motherfucker\u2019s hands, but these are the most beautiful hands, and something about holding them calmed all my fear.\u201d The story is sweet, vividly told, and if transcribed in full, would take up half this piece.</p> <p>Gottsagen\u2019s memories of the drive are snappier. \u201cI could tell Shia was a badass,\u201d he says. But for him, the journey was still more profound, his film finally being made after a life of being told he could never be a professional actor. He wanted, he says, the industry to understand that disabled actors could be movie stars, too.</p> <p>Although he has lived independently for several years, his mother Shelley remains a major presence in his life. Before filming began, LaBeouf says, she and he had a frank conversation. \u201cOn paper, I\u2019m a fuck-up.\u201d He says this matter-of-factly. \u201cI\u2019m not Tom Hanks. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/08/sia-apologises-to-those-who-feel-triggered-by-provocative-elastic-heart-video\" title=\"\">Search my name on the internet</a> and you\u2019re going to find a list of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/28/shia-labeouf-raped-performance-art-project-dazed\" title=\"\">scary things</a>. So it was a risk for them.\u201d He wanted, he says, to spend as much time as possible with Gottsagen, mimicking their characters\u2019 relationship. \u201cFor Zack, that was going to be uncomfortable, because here\u2019s this dude who doesn\u2019t want to go away. I don\u2019t want to go to another room. I want to be in his room. I couldn\u2019t ask certain actors for that. Certain actors are too professional.\u201d</p> <p>In the evenings during the shoot, the pair routinely hung out. They watched wrestling, much loved by Gottsagen, and scolded each other over their vices: Gottsagen ate too much ice-cream; LaBeouf drank too much gin. Alcohol has long been a problem.</p> <p>At 4am on 8 July 2017, a drunk LaBeouf was arrested in Savannah, having initially approached a stranger for a cigarette. Evidence of how the situation escalated is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2017/jul/13/shia-labeouf-arrest-video-shows-actors-expletive-filled-rant-video\" title=\"\">widely available online</a>, including bodycam footage from a black police officer who, the actor ranted at length, should not have been arresting \u201ca white person who gives a fuck\u201d in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jan/26/shia-labeouf-arrested-anti-trump-art-installation-he-will-not-divide-us-new-york\" title=\"\">age of Trump</a>.

And I can\u2019t come to terms with it. And no one\u2019s talking to me and I\u2019m talking to no one, and I know my life has exploded again. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jul/12/shia-labeouf-racist-rant-black-police-officer-video\" title=\"\">And I am in deep shame</a>.\u201d</p> <p>With the legal fallout still uncertain, Gottsagen sat on the floor opposite LaBeouf, to tell him he had jeopardised his one chance of starring in a film. Don\u2019t blow this for me, he said. \u201cI was mad,\u201d Gottsagen says. \u201cAngry. Frustrated.\u201d Both men cried. \u201cAnd I was worried about Shia doing the wrong things, being out in the middle of the night.\u201d</p> <p>When the shoot restarted, Nilson and Schwartz had the actors film a scene onboard a boat in which LaBeouf\u2019s character is overcome by guilt. As they waited for \u201caction\u201d to be called, without knowing the camera was already rolling, Gottsagen reached out and lay his hand on his co-star\u2019s back. LaBeouf crumpled into him. \u201cThat is not method acting bullshit,\u201d he says. \u201cTo be given permission to come into this man\u2019s life and the infractions still come \u2013 right then, I\u2019m broken. That\u2019s documentary.\u201d</p> <p>LaBeouf promised Gottsagen he would not drink for the rest of the shoot. Two years later, he is still sober. He later admitted the role in his case of white privilege (had he been arrested as a person of colour, other outcomes would have been likely). After filming came court-ordered rehab. There, a counsellor told him to write down the most significant events in his life story. Steeped in movies, he did so in script form, then sent that script to his friend, director Alma Har\u2019el.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2015/jun/29/shia-labeouf-freestyle-rap-youtube-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4a7y3\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2328267\"            data-video-name=\"Shia LaBeouf performs freestyle rap in a park: 'Watch me I'm the greatest' \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Corey James/Everyday Instrumentals\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435544363839/Shia-Labeouf-001.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-457298778\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435544363839/Shia-Labeouf-001.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/06/29/150629Shia_FromGAus-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/06/29/150629Shia_FromGAus_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/06/29/150629Shia_FromGAus.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/06/29/150629Shia_FromGAus_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/06/29/150629Shia_FromGAus/150629Shia_FromGAus.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2015/jun/29/shia-labeouf-freestyle-rap-youtube-video\">Shia LaBeouf performs freestyle rap in a park: \u2018Watch me I\u2019m the greatest\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The result became Honey Boy, titled after his father\u2019s pet name for him. Jeffrey LaBeouf was a Vietnam veteran and former heroin addict who is resentfully on his son\u2019s payroll, the pre-teen Shia a jobbing actor on low-rent TV shows. A poor kid breadwinning in the space where a childhood is meant to go, without the boundaries that other 12-year-olds have, it makes the perfect recipe for an adulthood spent clashing with authority. The film is incredible \u2013 like a cartoon character turned flesh-and-blood in front of you, then telling you their innermost secrets.</p> <p>By now, talking about it seems unavoidable. I ask LaBeouf which of his two new films feels more exposing. He answers without missing a beat. \u201cThis film is much more exposing than Honey Boy. Peanut Butter Falcon feels like real time. Like watching myself through a window. Honey Boy is a history. It hits hard, but it has novelty. It\u2019s less dangerous. It\u2019s much more something you put on a shelf.\u201d Because he wrote it himself? Crafted it? \u201cYeah. It seems more naked, right? It\u2019s not more naked. What it is, is a film about this clown mask everyone knows me for, that I\u2019ve been wearing a very long time. To me, it\u2019s not a revelation.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People tell me to stay away from Shia. They don't understand the real him.

They\u2019re different things.\u201d</p> <p>The tricksy nature of actors \u2013 suckers for a killer line \u2013 is not lost on LaBeouf. He also seems tired of make-believe. His career in studio movies has been put into deep freeze by his reputation, but much about his old life seems to go unmourned. \u201cI hadn\u2019t been in love with it for a long time,\u201d he says.

LaBeouf talks about his honesty like a talisman.</p> <p>\u201cI look to him as an example. I know I come in defensive. I come in playing music. I say: \u2018Here we go with the Guardian.\u2019 I try to bring my world into the room. He doesn\u2019t. You came in here and he was sitting quietly. He\u2019s Paul Newman. So I look to him and I know I need to switch my life up.\u201d</p> <p>The two now have their arms around each other. Gottsagen tells LaBeouf he loves him. \u201cI love you, too,\u201d LaBeouf says.</p> <p>He starts to speak again, but Gottsagen \u2013 having spent the past few minutes sitting being talked about \u2013 has his own monologue to deliver. \u201cI have been changing Shia\u2019s life,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s how I do things. And Shia has proved to himself he doesn\u2019t have to act out.

My answer is: \u2018No.\u2019 Because people don\u2019t understand the real Shia. And those people need to stop saying those things about Shia.

Physically, he looks much the same now, beard and T-shirt and worked-on upper arms. Then I watch The Peanut Butter Falcon, the film he was making at the time. It stars Gottsagen as a young man with Down\u2019s syndrome who goes on the run from the retirement home he has been placed in by the state, joining a fugitive fisherman played by LaBeouf on an escape along the eastern seaboard. The result \u2013 charming, Mark Twain-ish \u2013 was the sleeper hit of the US summer. For Gottsagen, 34, the bustle of interviews and film festivals is something new. LaBeouf, 33, is less excited. \u201cI\u2019ve been on this rollercoaster several times,\u201d he says. \u201cSo the only way for it to be fun is to do it with someone who has never been on it before.\u201d Gottsagen has been acting in amateur plays since he was a child, inspired by Grease and Hairspray, with a striking gift as a performer. In the film, he and LaBeouf play off each other beautifully. \u201cI always wanted to do acting to express my feelings and also to show people my abilities,\u201d he says. He met writer-directors Tyler Nilson and Mike Schwartz at a California film-making camp for actors with and without disabilities. The three resolved to make a feature to showcase Gottsagen \u2013 a herculean task given their lack of industry connections. For a time, Nilson pitched the project while living in a tent in LA. When the idea did reach executives, the conversations ended when Nilson said that it would star an actual actor with Down\u2019s. Finally, with a modest budget at last in place, the trio\u2019s \u201cproof-of-concept\u201d video was sent to LaBeouf. It was April 2017, the actor en route to a performance art project \u2013 a month alone in a remote Lapland cabin, from where he watched the video over and over. There was, LaBeouf says, a sense of truth to Gottsagen on screen he was desperate to act opposite. \u201cI knew I\u2019d be playing bass to his lead.\u201d Did the novelty of a supporting role come as a relief? He is shaking his head before I\u2019ve finished the question. \u201cNot novelty. Novelty\u2019s a shit word. There\u2019s no novelty to Base jumping. Right? There\u2019s no novelty to skydiving. Novelty is safe. This didn\u2019t feel safe.\u201d There is a long moment of eye contact. \u201cThis felt like lighting yourself on fire.\u201d I ask Gottsagen if he knew about his co-star before the film, and he nods and lists the hits of the chipper first act of the Shia LaBeouf story \u2013 the sitcom Even Stevens he starred in at 14, the Transformers movies, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Beyond that, LaBeouf himself is acutely aware, the references get darker. The paper bag reading \u201cI Am Not Famous Anymore\u201d worn over his head at the premiere of Lars von Trier\u2019s Nymphomaniac. The plagiarism of graphic novelist Daniel Clowes with his film Howard Cantour.com. The many run-ins with the police. The general air of hot mess. La Beouf rarely deals with journalists any more. Before his last major interview, promoting the film McEnroe vs Borg in 2018 \u2013 naturally, he played John McEnroe \u2013 he spent weeks with his therapist preparing answers to potential questions. His publicist insisted that all the questions for this interview focus on The Peanut Butter Falcon. Among the subjects implied to be off limits is Honey Boy, another new movie that LaBeouf stars in and wrote, about his early life as a child actor. He plays his own father. There is talk of Oscars for script and performance. LaBeouf\u2019s answers tend to come as monologues. He describes returning to the US after a lonely month in Lapland to meet Gottsagen for the first time, the pair driven by van to Georgia to start preparing for the shoot. LaBeouf, skittish and talkative, was disarmed by his co-star\u2019s silence. Eventually, they held hands. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve looked at this motherfucker\u2019s hands, but these are the most beautiful hands, and something about holding them calmed all my fear.\u201d The story is sweet, vividly told, and if transcribed in full, would take up half this piece. Gottsagen\u2019s memories of the drive are snappier. \u201cI could tell Shia was a badass,\u201d he says. But for him, the journey was still more profound, his film finally being made after a life of being told he could never be a professional actor. He wanted, he says, the industry to understand that disabled actors could be movie stars, too. Although he has lived independently for several years, his mother Shelley remains a major presence in his life. Before filming began, LaBeouf says, she and he had a frank conversation. \u201cOn paper, I\u2019m a fuck-up.\u201d He says this matter-of-factly. \u201cI\u2019m not Tom Hanks. Search my name on the internet and you\u2019re going to find a list of scary things. So it was a risk for them.\u201d He wanted, he says, to spend as much time as possible with Gottsagen, mimicking their characters\u2019 relationship. \u201cFor Zack, that was going to be uncomfortable, because here\u2019s this dude who doesn\u2019t want to go away. I don\u2019t want to go to another room. I want to be in his room. I couldn\u2019t ask certain actors for that. Certain actors are too professional.\u201d In the evenings during the shoot, the pair routinely hung out. They watched wrestling, much loved by Gottsagen, and scolded each other over their vices: Gottsagen ate too much ice-cream; LaBeouf drank too much gin. Alcohol has long been a problem. At 4am on 8 July 2017, a drunk LaBeouf was arrested in Savannah, having initially approached a stranger for a cigarette. Evidence of how the situation escalated is widely available online, including bodycam footage from a black police officer who, the actor ranted at length, should not have been arresting \u201ca white person who gives a fuck\u201d in the age of Trump. LaBeouf was bailed later that morning, by which time word had reached the production, and everywhere else besides. LaBeouf talks about his return to set in the present tense. \u201cI can\u2019t look anyone in the eye. And I can\u2019t come to terms with it. And no one\u2019s talking to me and I\u2019m talking to no one, and I know my life has exploded again. And I am in deep shame.\u201d With the legal fallout still uncertain, Gottsagen sat on the floor opposite LaBeouf, to tell him he had jeopardised his one chance of starring in a film. Don\u2019t blow this for me, he said. \u201cI was mad,\u201d Gottsagen says. \u201cAngry. Frustrated.\u201d Both men cried. \u201cAnd I was worried about Shia doing the wrong things, being out in the middle of the night.\u201d When the shoot restarted, Nilson and Schwartz had the actors film a scene onboard a boat in which LaBeouf\u2019s character is overcome by guilt. As they waited for \u201caction\u201d to be called, without knowing the camera was already rolling, Gottsagen reached out and lay his hand on his co-star\u2019s back. LaBeouf crumpled into him. \u201cThat is not method acting bullshit,\u201d he says. \u201cTo be given permission to come into this man\u2019s life and the infractions still come \u2013 right then, I\u2019m broken. That\u2019s documentary.\u201d LaBeouf promised Gottsagen he would not drink for the rest of the shoot. Two years later, he is still sober. He later admitted the role in his case of white privilege (had he been arrested as a person of colour, other outcomes would have been likely). After filming came court-ordered rehab. There, a counsellor told him to write down the most significant events in his life story. Steeped in movies, he did so in script form, then sent that script to his friend, director Alma Har\u2019el. The result became Honey Boy, titled after his father\u2019s pet name for him. Jeffrey LaBeouf was a Vietnam veteran and former heroin addict who is resentfully on his son\u2019s payroll, the pre-teen Shia a jobbing actor on low-rent TV shows. A poor kid breadwinning in the space where a childhood is meant to go, without the boundaries that other 12-year-olds have, it makes the perfect recipe for an adulthood spent clashing with authority. The film is incredible \u2013 like a cartoon character turned flesh-and-blood in front of you, then telling you their innermost secrets. By now, talking about it seems unavoidable. I ask LaBeouf which of his two new films feels more exposing. He answers without missing a beat. \u201cThis film is much more exposing than Honey Boy. Peanut Butter Falcon feels like real time. Like watching myself through a window. Honey Boy is a history. It hits hard, but it has novelty. It\u2019s less dangerous. It\u2019s much more something you put on a shelf.\u201d Because he wrote it himself? Crafted it? \u201cYeah. It seems more naked, right? It\u2019s not more naked. What it is, is a film about this clown mask everyone knows me for, that I\u2019ve been wearing a very long time. To me, it\u2019s not a revelation. \u201cHoney Boy explains my life up to this point,\u201d he says. \u201cThis film saved my life. They\u2019re different things.\u201d The tricksy nature of actors \u2013 suckers for a killer line \u2013 is not lost on LaBeouf. He also seems tired of make-believe. His career in studio movies has been put into deep freeze by his reputation, but much about his old life seems to go unmourned. \u201cI hadn\u2019t been in love with it for a long time,\u201d he says. There was, he says, a lot of \u201cnovelty brotherhood\u201d. Two years after leaving Georgia, he and Gottsagen are still frequently in touch. Outside the interview, they discuss attending the wrestling spectacular WrestleMania. LaBeouf has lately directed his energies towards Slauson Rec, the free acting school he co-founded in downtown LA; Gottsagen has taught other disabled actors for many years. LaBeouf talks about his honesty like a talisman. \u201cI look to him as an example. I know I come in defensive. I come in playing music. I say: \u2018Here we go with the Guardian.\u2019 I try to bring my world into the room. He doesn\u2019t. You came in here and he was sitting quietly. He\u2019s Paul Newman. So I look to him and I know I need to switch my life up.\u201d The two now have their arms around each other. Gottsagen tells LaBeouf he loves him. \u201cI love you, too,\u201d LaBeouf says. He starts to speak again, but Gottsagen \u2013 having spent the past few minutes sitting being talked about \u2013 has his own monologue to deliver. \u201cI have been changing Shia\u2019s life,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s how I do things. And Shia has proved to himself he doesn\u2019t have to act out. So I\u2019m going to keep taking the chance of being close to him.\u201d Every word is measured, deliberate. \u201cA lot of people have come to me talking about Shia, and they always tell me: \u2018Stay away from Shia.\u2019 But I am not going to do that. My answer is: \u2018No.\u2019 Because people don\u2019t understand the real Shia. And those people need to stop saying those things about Shia. And I don\u2019t really care how people feel about that, because I can make my own decisions.\u201d The Peanut Butter Falcon is released today. See review, page 10",

There\u2019s a point where tragedy strikes and shakes Bob from his addled stupor, but even that isn\u2019t overemphasized as the big turning point that leads him back toward rehabilitation. The case for Drugstore Cowboy as the best film about drug addiction is made through many subtle pieces of evidence, each accumulating into a pointillist slice-of-life that feels absolutely true to these characters and to the mindsets and realities of others like them. At rehab, Bob confesses simply: \u201cI\u2019m a junkie. I like drugs. I like the whole lifestyle. But it just didn\u2019t pay off.\u201d He\u2019s not alone.",

      "body": "<p>On a recent weeknight in midtown Manhattan, a trickle of professional women wearing sheath dresses and smart blouses swept into a delicately lit penthouse. The space they entered was filled with women quietly working and chatting, seated on an array of curved pastel furniture, designed to fit the precise ergonomic specifications of the average woman. The women\u2019s computers bore stickers reading \u201cI\u2019m With Her\u201d, \u201cHermione 2020\u201d, and \u201cCornell\u201d. The colour-coded bookshelves behind them included works such as 50 Ways to Comfort a Woman in Labor, Suffragette: My Own Story, and Cunt: A Declaration of Independence.</p> <p>It was a typical Wednesday night at The Wing, an exclusive club that describes itself as a \u201cnetwork of work and community spaces designed for women of all definitions\u201d. For between $185 and $250 per month, US Wing members \u2013 or Winglets, as the company sometimes calls them \u2013 can use the space to work, eat, socialise, breastfeed, shower, network, exercise, nap, reapply their makeup, meditate or all of the above. In other words, The Wing is a one-stop shop for the performance of contemporary mainstream feminism, a meticulously curated space where women can blow-dry their hair or \u201c<a href=\"https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160907/flatiron/all-women-club-opening-flatiron-with-coworking-space-lactation-station/\" title=\"\">stage a small coup</a>\u201d, depending on the day.</p> <p>Audrey Gelman, the company\u2019s co-founder and CEO, often tells The Wing\u2019s origin story roughly as follows: she was working as a press secretary, and later as a political consultant, dashing from city to city and from meetings to parties. This lifestyle forced her to change her outfits in Starbucks and Amtrak bathrooms, places she found \u201c<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/designofbusiness-businessofdesign/s2e1-audrey-gelman-and-emily-oberman\" title=\"\">semi-degrading</a>\u201d. She dreamed of having a more dignified place to go, where women like her \u2013 talented, outgoing, highly ambitious \u2013 could find like-minded souls, get changed and charge their phones in peace. Thus the idea for The Wing was born.</p> <p>The company now has eight locations \u2013 three in New York City, and one each in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Boston and Washington DC, with five more scheduled to open imminently. Its first international outpost, on Great Portland Street in London, opens next week. Second locations in London, San Francisco and LA are in the works; there will be 20 Wings by 2020. Over the past two years, The Wing has raised $117.5m in funding, attracting a formidable and diverse array of investors, whose ranks include Serena Williams, President Obama\u2019s friend and former senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, and members of the US women\u2019s soccer team.</p> <p>Since the moment it opened its doors three years ago, The Wing has attracted the kind of buzz, funding and controversy usually reserved for projects involving Gwyneth Paltrow or Lena Dunham. (Not totally coincidentally, Dunham is a close friend of Gelman\u2019s and a Wing founding member. Gelman had a cameo on Girls, and was famously the basis for the character of <a href=\"https://girls.fandom.com/wiki/Marnie_Michaels\" title=\"\">Marnie</a>.) The attention The Wing generates is, in large part, because it was founded upon a paradox: its brand is steeped in the feminist language of emancipation, empowerment and equality, while its business is based on one of society\u2019s most elitist institutions: the private members\u2019 club. The result is that the company has become a kind of proxy for national debates over issues of gender, race, inclusivity, intersectionality and the limits and possibilities of neoliberal democratic politics. And yet, the number of people who actually belong to The Wing is still pretty small \u2013 it aims to have about 15,000 members by the end of the year, slightly less than the monthly <a href=\"https://www.abc.org.uk/product/9467\" title=\"\">circulation figures</a> for The Cricketer magazine, and 16 times less than the total youth membership of the <a href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/\" title=\"\">RSPB</a>.</p> <p>Because The Wing is in part a co-working space, many of its members hail from professions in which office space is a rare commodity \u2013 the creative class of writers, editors, freelancers, artists and influencers who make up the media. Handily, these are precisely the same kind of people who like to tweet, Instagram and write about the world as it looks from The Wing. This has ensured that even its minutest details, from the <a href=\"https://sprudge.com/the-perch-in-the-wing-soho-128458.html\" title=\"\">coffee</a> to the <a href=\"http://www.lonny.com/How+To+Get+The+Wing+In+Your+Home\" title=\"\">furniture</a> to the <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/lunch-at-the-wing-nyc\" title=\"\">lunch offerings</a> to the <a href=\"https://observer.com/2018/07/the-wing-store-summer-merch-launch/\" title=\"\">customi</a><a href=\"https://observer.com/2018/07/the-wing-store-summer-merch-launch/\" title=\"\">sed scented candles</a> in the gift shop, have been deemed worthy of an article of their own. It also means that The Wing has been the subject of seemingly endless criticism \u2013 accused of being too rich, too white, too cis-gendered, too feminist, not feminist enough, too liberal and not liberal enough. One former employee described it as a \u201csuper-toxic\u201d place, while a British member told me that upon walking into The Wing in New York, she felt that she had found her \u201choly grail.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ce3efc57837bac07895686339fbd0946b806a3cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce3efc57837bac07895686339fbd0946b806a3cb/311_414_3469_5794/599.jpg\" alt=\"Audrey Gelman at a dinner to celebrate the forthcoming opening of The Wing in London.\" width=\"599\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Audrey Gelman at a dinner to celebrate the forthcoming opening of The Wing in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David M Benett/Getty for The Wing</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That Wednesday evening in Manhattan, Wing members sat with their guests, sipping ros\u00e9 and snacking on seasoned popcorn as they waited for the evening\u2019s event to begin. It was nominally a talk by the writer Caitlin Moscatello, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/See-Jane-Win-Inspiring-Changing/dp/1524742929\" title=\"\">whose new book</a> tells the stories of first-time female candidates running for office, but it was more like a political strategy meeting for women who were thinking of running themselves. Sitting in the audience felt like being entrusted with trade secrets. Moscatello sat between Kimberly Peeler-Allen, co-founder of Higher Heights, an organisation that works to elect black women, and Catalina Cruz, the newly elected assemblywoman for New York\u2019s 39th district.</p> <p>After the three speakers finished their discussion, a woman in the audience raised her hand and introduced herself to the group. She was planning a run for local office, but had yet to announce. \u201cPlease don\u2019t repeat this!\u201d the woman told the crowd. \u201cCone of silence!\u201d exclaimed Peeler-Allen. As Cruz went on to describe the personal and financial strains of campaigning, the woman who had announced her run looked increasingly stricken. \u201cYou\u2019re scaring me!\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine, girl,\u201d said Cruz. \u201cJust get yourself ready.\u201d</p> <p>It was just the kind of exchange that The Wing has been designed to generate. One of its press representatives described it to me as an \u201caccelerator\u201d for the coming revolution, a place where women are preparing to \u201cleap year\u201d into a more egalitarian future. In the US, it has become an almost compulsory campaign stop for women, trans and non-binary political candidates. Three of the women running for president have visited in the past year, and a Wing spokesperson told me that the other two \u2013 front-runner Elizabeth Warren and Senator Amy Klobuchar \u2013 are actively discussing doing so. The company\u2019s corporate ranks are stacked with former Democratic political operatives who worked on Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaigns or in the Obama administration.</p> <p>To belong to The Wing is to join this in-crowd, a kind of utopian shadow government. \u201cThere\u2019s a secret smile that you share with the other women in the elevator,\u201d said Jess Lee, a partner at the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Sequoia, which led the The Wing\u2019s latest <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-12-19/the-wing-gets-75-million-to-expand-its-working-women-collective\" title=\"\">$75</a><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-12-19/the-wing-gets-75-million-to-expand-its-working-women-collective\" title=\"\">m</a> funding round. And it was true \u2013 I found myself giving a look of ambiguous fellowship to the women I encountered in The Wing, and felt a slight twinge of embarrassment at the check-in desk as they swiped their membership cards and glided away, while I announced myself as a journalist, there to report on the workings of their private club. At Moscatello\u2019s event, I laughed and clapped along with the women in the audience as they shared strategies for their political triumph. In the elevator on the way out, an older woman turned to me and two young women and gave us the secret smile. \u201cSo, are you all going to run?\u201d she asked.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The Wing opened its doors on 10 October 2016, four weeks before the presidential election. One of the very first events it held was an invitation-only \u201cvery adult sleepover\u201d <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BLNPTM3DfO9/\" title=\"\">featuring face masks</a>, monogrammed pyjamas and pillow fights. The next one was a public \u201cphone bank and debate watch party\u201d in partnership with Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, which invited women to spend three hours calling members of the public and urging them to vote the first woman into the Oval Office. Gelman and her co-founder Lauren Kassan hoped that their company would flourish alongside a Clinton administration, buoyed by the arrival of feminism\u2019s golden age.</p> <p>On election night, about <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/fashion/the-wing-election-night-party-audrey-gelman.html\" title=\"\">175 women gathered</a> in the Wing\u2019s Flatiron location to watch the results come in. Like just about everyone else in New York, they expected it would be a celebratory event, a coronation. But as the evening drew on, and it became increasingly clear that Clinton was not going to win, the mood shifted. \u201cOh my goodness, you could feel it getting colder,\u201d says No\u00ebl Duan, a Wing founding member. At one point, Gelman, wearing a backwards baseball cap and a pink \u201cMadam President\u201d T-shirt, sat down and held Duan\u2019s hand. </p> <p>The Wing was heavily aligned with Clinton, yet among the Democratic party\u2019s young, progressive voters, Clinton\u2019s strain of establishment politics was swiftly disavowed. In no time at all, the former secretary of state had become both a feminist martyr and a political liability, a flawed candidate whose defeat everyone felt they should have seen coming.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b546f4f30ad3a408cbc559b432cf8f1eea190a6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b546f4f30ad3a408cbc559b432cf8f1eea190a6f/0_366_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aminatou Sow (left) and Audrey Gelman (right) interviewing Hillary Clinton at The Wing in Soho, New York in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aminatou Sow (left) and Audrey Gelman (right) interviewing Hillary Clinton at The Wing in Soho, New York in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tory Williams</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Almost everyone I spoke to about the company said it would be a different place if Clinton had won. Instead of being just a beautiful space for women to revel beneath a shattered glass ceiling, it became, for its members, a place to take shelter. \u201cIt was a really sobering moment,\u201d Kassan told me. \u201cI think there was already the demand and excitement, and I think that we realised just how important it was now.\u201d</p> <p>A few days later, The Wing briefly opened its doors to all women who felt they needed a place to regroup. Gelman and Kassan gave the organisers of the Women\u2019s March on Washington access to the space, and in January, they hired buses to take 100 Wing members to Washington to <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BPiF4tqDnCF/\" title=\"\">participate</a>. The Wing began to emphasise civic and political programming, ramped up hiring and continued planning to expand. In interviews, Gelman has articulated the mission in overtly political terms: \u201cBeing a girl is no longer politically neutral. Your identity, whether you like it or not, is now political,\u201d she told Elle in 2017.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s loss marked the unravelling of the already tenuous coalition of American feminists. The 2017 Women\u2019s March was the largest single-day protest in US history, but it quickly became known more for its <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/12/21/18145176/feminism-womens-march-2018-2019-farrakhan-intersectionality\" title=\"\">controversy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/gdpr-consent/?destination=%2flocal%2fthe-womens-march-in-year-3-can-the-movement-overcome-a-year-of-controversy-and-division%2f2019%2f01%2f17%2f0eb23740-18c9-11e9-8813-cb9dec761e73_story.html%3f\" title=\"\">in-fighting</a> than for its transformative politics. The Wing was born into a world in which women were banding together in new and enlivening ways, but often doing so in competing camps. To many, Clinton\u2019s Sandbergian, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/mar/13/lean-in-sheryl-sandberg-review\" title=\"\">Lean In</a>\u201d brand of corporate feminism had been fully discredited and a more radical approach was needed, while others felt that the emergency of President Trump in the White House meant that this was a time for progressives to unite, rather than pursue potentially divisive new policies.</p> <p>The Wing has found itself trying to please all sides, in the process finding itself attacked from all sides, often within its own walls. It is an easy target, and the fact that it is owned and operated by women makes it all the more so. Where its programming and brand have conflicted with the aims of progressive politics, its members have called the company out. Yet anyone who criticises The Wing may expect to be swiftly criticised in turn, on one side for poking holes in an otherwise admirable project, and on the other for paying it any attention at all. All parties involved might expect their exchange to be followed by a polite reminder of the specific actions that The Wing has taken to respond to the initial criticism, and perhaps an invitation to continue their discussion in a panel event. To begin to reckon with The Wing\u2019s project is to risk entering an \u201couroboros of doom\u201d, as the writer and illustrator Shelby Lorman put it. \u201cIt feels like such a perfect metaphor,\u201d she said, for the many tangled and charged disagreements over what it means to be a modern woman, feminist and political subject.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Before any woman sets foot in The Wing, she will, in all likelihood, already know what it looks like. Every corner of every branch seems to have been designed specifically for Instagram, which is to say that the furniture and art and food and plants and people feel as if they have been carefully chosen to telegraph that they are coveted, consumable goods. The company posts mock-ups of every new space months before it is built, so that women between the ages of 26 to 35 living in major metropolitan areas and possessing roughly $2,000 of annual disposable income can begin to imagine themselves wandering around there. (The company\u2019s omnipresence on social media is another reminder that its power derives from not letting everyone in and letting everyone know about it.)</p> <p>Every outpost contains careful local touches, and each projects an air of strained yet somewhat soothing whimsy. In the Soho premises in New York, I walked up a set of stairs that read \u201cIt\u2019s not a reach when we climb together\u201d, before settling in to enjoy a \u201cfork the patriarchy\u201d grain bowl on a blue pastel desk. In its Washington DC outpost, located above a spa in Georgetown, one of the toniest corners of the city, there is a conference room named \u201cK Street\u201d, after the city\u2019s main lobbying <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K_Street_(Washington,_D.C.)\" title=\"\">thoroughfare</a>, and a phone booth <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BoO4TDOFmms/\" title=\"\">named after Anita Hill</a>, \u201clegal eagle\u201d. The Wing London, a five-storey penthouse in Fitzrovia, will offer a tearoom, terrace, fitness room and floral patterned tile floors, as well as a portrait gallery featuring the likenesses of Diane Abbott, Mary Beard and Amal Clooney, among others. It is the first members\u2019 club in London that has signed on to the mayor\u2019s living-wage pact, and proceeds from its cafe and its programming will benefit local charities. There will be trellises, black-and-white tiles and chandeliers. \u201cI was very inspired by the British countryside,\u201d Laetitia Gorra, the company\u2019s director of interiors, told me.</p> <p>Walking through one of the Wing\u2019s premises can sometimes feel like exploring what would happen if Oliver Bonas were to design a luxury corporate office: lots of pastel and very few sharp edges. The walls, cushions and seating offer an array of muted pink, mustard and rose-gold hues, a colour scheme chosen in part for its calming effect. The air conditioning is usually set at 22C (72F), to accommodate women\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/shortcuts/2017/oct/11/why-women-sewcretly-turn-up-the-heating\" title=\"\">slightly lower</a> skin temperatures. Chiara de Rege, who helped design the first few locations, said that the goal was to make them \u201cfeminine, but not girly girl or precious\u201d. Hilary Koyfman, who collaborated with De Rege on the early design, has <a href=\"https://www.domino.com/content/inside-the-wing-nyc/\" title=\"\">described</a> the overall aesthetic as \u201ckind of like Mad Men \u2013 without the men\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"01c6989758abf047dc0e6b1aea5490d2329d01c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01c6989758abf047dc0e6b1aea5490d2329d01c7/0_1095_4380_5475/800.jpg\" alt=\"Lauren Kassan, co-founder and COO of The Wing.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lauren Kassan, co-founder and COO of The Wing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tory Williams</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is certainly something beautiful and powerful, even alchemic, about being in a women-only space. For some women, it is a place to find support, friendship and inspiration, where they do not have to apologise for anything or worry about their things being stolen or their drinks being spiked. Two locations currently offer childcare services, while every location features a private nursing room for new mothers. Each Wing also offers a luxurious beauty room with a wide array of hair and makeup products. These beauty rooms, staff told me, are a key part of the company\u2019s \u201cstorytelling\u201d. They are designed to make life easier, as <a href=\"https://intothegloss.com/2016/10/audrey-gelman-the-wing/\" title=\"\">Gelman once said</a>, for the kind of woman for whom \u201cpart of being successful is not only making sure that you know everything that\u2019s going on in the news and that you\u2019ve responded to every single email in your inbox, and that nothing is on fire in your house, but also looking good because it is what\u2019s expected of you and can make you feel more confident\u201d.</p> <p>Yet, for its critics, this point of articulation is where the alchemy dissolves: instead of being a place that seeks to lift all women up, it becomes a place where one must constantly consider how well one is performing both feminism and femininity. And with any performance, this can be exhausting, and always carries the risk of failure. Spending time at The Wing, I was reminded of the kind of \u201cideal woman\u201d that the writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/aug/02/athleisure-barre-kale-tyranny-ideal-woman-labour\" title=\"\">Jia Tolentino described</a> in a recent essay: she has expensive hair and expensive skin, she is successful and svelte. \u201cToday\u2019s ideal woman is of a type that coexists easily with feminism in its current market-friendly and mainstream form,\u201d she writes. \u201cThis sort of feminism has organised itself around being as visible and appealing to as many people as possible; it has greatly over-valorised women\u2019s individual success.\u201d</p> <p>Some of the tensions within this brand of feminism can be glimpsed, not too surprisingly, at The Wing\u2019s in-house shops, where it sells T-shirts, bags and hats with slogans like \u201ccasual business woman\u201d and \u201cannihilate the patriarchy\u201d on them. There are workout clothes and $17.50 keychains. When I visited the Soho location in early August, the shop was selling a range of colourful award ribbons, printed with lines such as \u201cWow, you\u2019re not sexist\u201d, \u201cBest ally\u201d, and \u201cYou\u2019re my Wingman of the year\u201d. As Jezebel has reported, some of the merchandise <a href=\"https://jezebel.com/the-wings-merchandise-sure-looks-a-lot-like-popular-fem-1838168169\" title=\"\">resembles</a> that of other feminist artists. The ribbons, for example, seem to be emulating the work of Shelby Lorman, whose book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Awards-Good-Boys-Dating-Standards/dp/0143134310\" title=\"\">Awards for Good Boys</a> satirises the low standards to which men are held. Lorman first spotted The Wing\u2019s version of the ribbons on Instagram. \u201cI thought it was amazing and hilarious, because they are awards for men, for sale for $6, but they\u2019re stripped of humour, so it\u2019s literal,\u201d she told me. \u201cI truly don\u2019t think that anything could be funnier because if they did borrow my work, they have totally missed the point. And they are monetising the missed point, which is kind of genius. It\u2019s so sinister and so evil that I kind of love it.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Ever since it first opened its doors, The Wing has struggled to define who exactly it is for. Its representatives, describing its membership policy, use the words \u201cexclusive\u201d and \u201cinclusive\u201d in the same breath. No one gets rejected, they told me. Applicants are merely placed on the waiting list \u2013 35,000 people have applied so far \u2013 when their preferred space is at capacity. Yet, in a 2018 presentation to the New York City Commission on Human Rights, The Wing\u2019s attorneys stated that it is \u201chighly selective\u201d and that \u201conly around 40% of applicants are admitted\u201d. Aspiring members must explain how they have promoted or supported The Wing\u2019s mission of advancing women, and also describe the dinner party of their dreams.</p> <p>The commission was investigating the company for discriminating on the basis of gender. (New York law requires it to investigate any complaint it receives. The investigation closed in March 2019.) At first, the club refused to allow men into its spaces, even as guests. A former employee told me that one of the first things they were taught was how to keep men out: \u201cBlock them with your body, push them to the elevator, push the elevator button.\u201d But outward appearance does not always correlate with gender identity; the employee witnessed instances where individuals who presented themselves to the check-in desk at The Wing were misgendered by staff. In August 2018, a serially litigious 53-year-old man sued The Wing for up to $12m for rejecting his application, claiming that he had been denied entry because of his gender. After the lawsuit was filed, and as a result of conversations with its trans and nonbinary staff and members, The Wing adopted a formal membership policy that would evaluate applicants \u201cbased on their commitment to The Wing\u2019s mission, regardless of their perceived gender or gender identity\u201d. In a letter to members announcing the new policy, Kassan and Gelman wrote that they would be \u201cworking to actively incorporate the perspective of trans and non-binary members into our offerings\u201d. The language of guest emails was changed from \u201cshe\u2019s landed\u201d to \u201cthey\u2019ve landed.\u201d The policy also meant that men <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/the-wing-changed-membership-policy-to-allow-men-after-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-2019-1\" title=\"\">could enter the space</a> as guests and apply for membership, if they really wanted to.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"304cb5b7509d73629c492e21f4469acdb381ef9a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/304cb5b7509d73629c492e21f4469acdb381ef9a/0_0_2048_2048/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Wing\u2019s \u2018casual business woman\u2019 cap.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Wing\u2019s \u2018casual business woman\u2019 cap.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Wing</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The company\u2019s success is partly due to the fact that, over the past five years, the identity-based members club has emerged as a powerful trend. In the US, The Wing already has too many competitors and imitators to list, which have names such as The Lola (Atlanta), The Broad (Richmond), The Assembly (San Francisco), The Riveter (Seattle) and The Hivery (Mill Valley). In London, women\u2019s clubs such as The AllBright and The Trouble Club already occupy part of The Wing\u2019s target audience. In November, Ethel\u2019s Club, \u201cthe first private social and wellness club designed with people of colour in mind\u201d, will open its doors in Brooklyn. \u201cThe Wing was created for a certain type of woman, which, from my point of view, is not for me,\u201d Ethel\u2019s Club founder, Najla Austin, told me. \u201cI\u2019m looking for my people. It\u2019s not unlike religion. If you write down the similarities of Catholicism and a social club, they\u2019re not that different.\u201d</p> <p>Akilah Cadet, who runs a diversity and inclusion consulting firm in Oakland, had a similar first impression of The Wing, and decided that it probably was not for her. But then Yari Blanco, at the time The Wing\u2019s senior manager of culture and diversity, reached out to her about her work, and Cadet decided to join the club. Being a member, she rightly predicted, would bring in business. \u201cHonestly, my objective was like, get this money, so that\u2019s what I did,\u201d she told me. She said her application to the San Francisco location was fast-tracked, and soon she found herself at an event thrown specifically for black women. At one point, a white woman stood up on the couch and announced that they would be giving away T-shirts reading \u201cphenomenally black\u201d. Cadet raised her concerns about the event to Blanco and her team, criticising what she perceived to be a lack of serious thought about the way the event was organised. Two days later, she found herself on a panel at The Wing sponsored by Secret deodorant, where she got a new client.</p> <p>The company has made similar missteps along the way, and has almost always made concerted efforts to correct them wherever they arise. No\u00ebl Duan, the founding member from New York, who is Chinese American, told me that when The Wing held an event for Asian women, they posted an Instagram story intended to celebrate the club\u2019s \u201cwomen from Asia\u201d. Duan did not attend, but some of her friends did. \u201cThey were like: we\u2019re not women from Asia, we\u2019re American,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I really love about Wing members is that they are willing to speak out, including against the company,\u201d Duan added, noting that the company had changed in response to criticism. \u201cI can see from personal experience that it has come a long way since they first launched,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Cadet took it upon herself to point out instances where The Wing could be more attentive to diversity and difference. Eventually, she was doing so much work for The Wing that she said they offered her a complimentary membership, and she frequently used the space to hold meetings in San Francisco. Like many of its critics, Cadet tries to view the company with generosity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lately, however, maintaining this nuanced view has come to require a more intricate set of mental gymnastics. At the end of May, a racial confrontation occurred at the West Hollywood branch. According to reporting by the <a href=\"https://zora.medium.com/why-we-need-more-black-women-workspaces-90f89b908001\" title=\"\">online magazine Zora</a>, Wing member Asha Grant, the director of The Free Black Women\u2019s Library Los Angeles, and her guest were harassed in the parking lot by \u201can unaccompanied white woman guest\u201d who began yelling at them after Grant took what she felt was her parking space. The <a href=\"https://jezebel.com/the-wing-is-publicly-responding-to-a-racist-incident-th-1837905439\" title=\"\">harassment and racist threats</a> continued inside, where the white woman gave the middle finger to Grant, her guest, and another black club member, Stephanie Kimou. In an attempt to ease the situation, staff offered Kimou, Grant and her guest a free meal, but the white woman was not asked to leave the premises.</p> <p>News of the incident spread quickly. In mid-August, Kimou and Grant posted on Instagram announcing that they were cancelling their memberships. \u201cAfter the initial allure of their perfectly designed co-working spaces, beauty rooms stocked full of Glossier and Goop, the lattes and their \u2018commitment to diversity\u2019, the facade started to crack and what was underneath all that pink felt oppressive and debilitating,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B1Q5T9ij5oN/\" title=\"\">Kimou wrote in her post</a>.</p> <p>Other black members <a href=\"https://jezebel.com/the-wing-is-publicly-responding-to-a-racist-incident-th-1837905439?%2Fsetsession\" title=\"\">began quitting The Wing</a>. \u201cThey didn\u2019t think it was going to get to this level,\u201d Cadet told me. On 5 September, Gelman and Kassan sent an email to all Wing members that finally acknowledged what had occurred: \u201cOur handling of it left everyone feeling disappointed, and the black member felt especially unprotected and let down,\u201d they wrote. In the following weeks, they would hold gatherings in every city \u201cwith the goal of improving community understanding and mutual trust\u201d, which the executive team would attend. Eleven days later, members received another email from Kassan and Gelman in which they apologised for \u201cthe ways we\u2019ve fallen short\u201d, and made commitments to pay more attention to racial inclusion, including reworking the club\u2019s code of conduct and changing member orientation to address issues of race and racial empathy. Two days after that, on 18 September, Gelman appeared on the cover of Inc. magazine in a long-sleeve black knit dress, her hands resting on her pregnant torso. She became the first visibly pregnant CEO to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/audreygelman/status/1174309715549065217\" title=\"\">grace the cover</a> of a business magazine.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>On 6 September, the day after the first email from Gelman and Kassan went out, I visited the company\u2019s new headquarters in the East Village in New York. Zara Rahim, senior director of strategic communications, gave me a tour around the four-storey office, which is located in what was once a <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/2019/06/27/the-wing-headquarters-east-village-new-york-city/\" title=\"\">hospital</a> for German immigrants and later expanded to include a dedicated women\u2019s wing. In the basement, the only place in the building where I spotted several men, the tech team was hard at work. Upstairs, we popped our heads into a mint-green conference room, where a planning meeting for the London launch was underway.</p> <p>Rahim and I settled into a couch in Kassan\u2019s office, where Kassan greeted us wearing a yellow plaid jacquard blazer and a logo <a href=\"https://shop.the-wing.com/collections/accessories/products/w-logo-necklace\" title=\"\">necklace</a> bearing The Wing\u2019s \u201chero W\u201d, which looks something like the Wonder Woman logo, but softer, rounder, cuter. While Gelman, as CEO, is the public face of the company, Kassan, as COO, tends to handle operations behind the scenes. Before this venture, Kassan was the first employee at the fitness chain SLT, which specialises in high-intensity reformer pilates (motto: \u201c<a href=\"https://sltnyc.com/studios/\" title=\"\">better sore than sorry</a>\u201d), and then moved on to Classpass, a fitness class app. She rarely gives interviews, but by the time we spoke, Gelman was busy preparing to go on maternity leave and Kassan was taking over some of her duties.</p> <p>Kassan was excited for the London launch, which she told me had been years in the making. She would be bringing her whole family over to celebrate the opening. I asked her about the recent email to members and about the common criticisms of the company. Diversity had been \u201ca part of who we are and what we\u2019ve cared about since the beginning\u201d, she explained. \u201cThat shows up through our programming and through our products. When things happen, we want to be transparent and clear about that \u2026 because there are things that happen outside in the world that we can\u2019t control. And we want to create a space to be able to have these honest and hard conversations.\u201d</p> <p>Kassan had less time for the criticism that membership is too expensive. \u201cI think the price point is just\u201d \u2013 she lowered her voice to a whisper \u2013 \u201c<em>bullshit</em>.\u201d The Wing is, indeed, more affordable than the vast majority of its competitors. \u201cAs women, we undervalue what we\u2019re providing and serving,\u201d Kassan said. \u201cWe get criticised about that, and we feel proud of what we\u2019re doing.\u201d In London, membership will cost \u00a3170 per month for access to a single location, and \u00a3240 for access to all locations. Approximately 7% of Wing members are awarded scholarships, which last for two years and cover the full cost of membership, and the company is planning tiered membership rates to expand access in the future.</p> <p>The more time I spent speaking to the company\u2019s critics and supporters, the clearer it became that the controversy it generates has far more to do with what it claims to be rather than what it actually is. Last month, for instance, it debuted a members-only job marketplace that allows members to post listings and hire one another. From a business perspective, this is a savvy move \u2013 giving ambitious women yet another reason to want to join, while connecting bosses who are members with a pool of promising candidates. But this is a very narrow vision of feminism. Of course, many talented people will gain new opportunities through this service but, equally obviously, its exclusivity threatens to exacerbate the same kinds of inequality that The Wing claims to want to combat.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b6ab0dc1f0f9408f60ce0a6083a05dda2a25a3bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6ab0dc1f0f9408f60ce0a6083a05dda2a25a3bf/0_0_4854_3236/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez at The Wing in SoHo, New York.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez at The Wing in SoHo, New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tory Williams/The Wing</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cFeminism, for me, is fundamentally about collective struggle, not individuals,\u201d says Sarah Banet-Weiser, a scholar of communication and gender studies at the London School of Economics. The Wing\u2019s strain of feminism, she argued, is something else: \u201cThey\u2019re empowering women to be better economic subjects within capitalism, empowering women to network, to get a raise, to address the pay gap. Those are real things, but they are really tied to capitalist logic.\u201d As a former employee put it, The Wing\u2019s feminism is less about making the world more equitable as it is about making sure women are given equal opportunities to make money: \u201cIt\u2019s like, you only make $1m? Well, this man makes $2m! You could make $2m if only it weren\u2019t for misogyny.\u201d (One recent post from The Wing\u2019s Instagram feed read: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B3IJAdPnNR3/\" title=\"\">Mood: CE0,000,000</a>\u201d.)</p> <p>Progressives often talk about The Wing in the same way they talk about the Democratic party: it\u2019s not great but maybe things will get better, maybe the politicians will figure it out, maybe the world The Wing\u2019s founders imagined they would serve will one day emerge. One vocal supporter of The Wing is, somewhat surprisingly, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Gelman <a href=\"https://observer.com/2018/07/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-political-event-audrey-gelman-the-wing/\" title=\"\">hosted a fundraiser</a> for Ocasio-Cortez at her home in Brooklyn last summer and, a few months later, the politician <a href=\"https://www.glamour.com/story/how-the-wing-became-a-secret-weapon-for-politicians\" title=\"\">told Glamour</a>: \u201cThe Wing isn\u2019t just a functional space, it\u2019s a real symbol of what\u2019s happening in our country.\u201d She called the company \u201cone of the most potent forces that we\u2019ve seen emerge in politics this year.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/aug/02/athleisure-barre-kale-tyranny-ideal-woman-labour\">Athleisure, barre and kale: the tyranny of the ideal woman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Many of the people I spoke to for this piece were disappointed in The Wing for a variety of reasons, but hesitant to publicly criticise it. They had made good friends there, and saw all the work that staff were putting in to make it a better place. They had low expectations for corporate behaviour, and saw The Wing doing a better job than most companies when it comes to addressing its failures. They understood the paradox of a company whose profitability rests upon both expanding its tent and guarding the entrances. \u201cI really wonder what the plan is to grow while staying true to their values,\u201d one San Francisco-based member told me. \u201cMaybe they have something up their sleeve, they have a ton of really smart women working for that company, but I don\u2019t see it.\u201d Cadet also felt burned out by her experience. \u201cI want this to go well. I want this to be a good thing,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe I\u2019ve done all that I can do.\u201d (\u201cAnd when you write that, say that I was gazing off into the distance,\u201d she joked.)</p> <p>The opening of the London branch comes as The Wing seems to be reckoning with its first few years. Last week, The Wing unveiled a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B3epZ2TnNej/\" title=\"\">mural advertisement</a> on a street corner in Shoreditch in east London. In a bright coral hue, it introduces The Wing as \u201cthe first place in London to solve the dual epidemic of mansplaining and manspreading\u201d. After it went up, Rahim texted me a photo of a handful of men and women pausing in front of it, presumably wondering what a thing called The Wing could be and what it might become.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "On a recent weeknight in midtown Manhattan, a trickle of professional women wearing sheath dresses and smart blouses swept into a delicately lit penthouse. The space they entered was filled with women quietly working and chatting, seated on an array of curved pastel furniture, designed to fit the precise ergonomic specifications of the average woman. The women\u2019s computers bore stickers reading \u201cI\u2019m With Her\u201d, \u201cHermione 2020\u201d, and \u201cCornell\u201d. The colour-coded bookshelves behind them included works such as 50 Ways to Comfort a Woman in Labor, Suffragette: My Own Story, and Cunt: A Declaration of Independence. It was a typical Wednesday night at The Wing, an exclusive club that describes itself as a \u201cnetwork of work and community spaces designed for women of all definitions\u201d. For between $185 and $250 per month, US Wing members \u2013 or Winglets, as the company sometimes calls them \u2013 can use the space to work, eat, socialise, breastfeed, shower, network, exercise, nap, reapply their makeup, meditate or all of the above. In other words, The Wing is a one-stop shop for the performance of contemporary mainstream feminism, a meticulously curated space where women can blow-dry their hair or \u201cstage a small coup\u201d, depending on the day. Audrey Gelman, the company\u2019s co-founder and CEO, often tells The Wing\u2019s origin story roughly as follows: she was working as a press secretary, and later as a political consultant, dashing from city to city and from meetings to parties. This lifestyle forced her to change her outfits in Starbucks and Amtrak bathrooms, places she found \u201csemi-degrading\u201d. She dreamed of having a more dignified place to go, where women like her \u2013 talented, outgoing, highly ambitious \u2013 could find like-minded souls, get changed and charge their phones in peace. Thus the idea for The Wing was born. The company now has eight locations \u2013 three in New York City, and one each in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Boston and Washington DC, with five more scheduled to open imminently. Its first international outpost, on Great Portland Street in London, opens next week. Second locations in London, San Francisco and LA are in the works; there will be 20 Wings by 2020. Over the past two years, The Wing has raised $117.5m in funding, attracting a formidable and diverse array of investors, whose ranks include Serena Williams, President Obama\u2019s friend and former senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, and members of the US women\u2019s soccer team. Since the moment it opened its doors three years ago, The Wing has attracted the kind of buzz, funding and controversy usually reserved for projects involving Gwyneth Paltrow or Lena Dunham. (Not totally coincidentally, Dunham is a close friend of Gelman\u2019s and a Wing founding member. Gelman had a cameo on Girls, and was famously the basis for the character of Marnie.) The attention The Wing generates is, in large part, because it was founded upon a paradox: its brand is steeped in the feminist language of emancipation, empowerment and equality, while its business is based on one of society\u2019s most elitist institutions: the private members\u2019 club. The result is that the company has become a kind of proxy for national debates over issues of gender, race, inclusivity, intersectionality and the limits and possibilities of neoliberal democratic politics. And yet, the number of people who actually belong to The Wing is still pretty small \u2013 it aims to have about 15,000 members by the end of the year, slightly less than the monthly circulation figures for The Cricketer magazine, and 16 times less than the total youth membership of the RSPB. Because The Wing is in part a co-working space, many of its members hail from professions in which office space is a rare commodity \u2013 the creative class of writers, editors, freelancers, artists and influencers who make up the media. Handily, these are precisely the same kind of people who like to tweet, Instagram and write about the world as it looks from The Wing. This has ensured that even its minutest details, from the coffee to the furniture to the lunch offerings to the customised scented candles in the gift shop, have been deemed worthy of an article of their own. It also means that The Wing has been the subject of seemingly endless criticism \u2013 accused of being too rich, too white, too cis-gendered, too feminist, not feminist enough, too liberal and not liberal enough. One former employee described it as a \u201csuper-toxic\u201d place, while a British member told me that upon walking into The Wing in New York, she felt that she had found her \u201choly grail.\u201d That Wednesday evening in Manhattan, Wing members sat with their guests, sipping ros\u00e9 and snacking on seasoned popcorn as they waited for the evening\u2019s event to begin. It was nominally a talk by the writer Caitlin Moscatello, whose new book tells the stories of first-time female candidates running for office, but it was more like a political strategy meeting for women who were thinking of running themselves. Sitting in the audience felt like being entrusted with trade secrets. Moscatello sat between Kimberly Peeler-Allen, co-founder of Higher Heights, an organisation that works to elect black women, and Catalina Cruz, the newly elected assemblywoman for New York\u2019s 39th district. After the three speakers finished their discussion, a woman in the audience raised her hand and introduced herself to the group. She was planning a run for local office, but had yet to announce. \u201cPlease don\u2019t repeat this!\u201d the woman told the crowd. \u201cCone of silence!\u201d exclaimed Peeler-Allen. As Cruz went on to describe the personal and financial strains of campaigning, the woman who had announced her run looked increasingly stricken. \u201cYou\u2019re scaring me!\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine, girl,\u201d said Cruz. \u201cJust get yourself ready.\u201d It was just the kind of exchange that The Wing has been designed to generate. One of its press representatives described it to me as an \u201caccelerator\u201d for the coming revolution, a place where women are preparing to \u201cleap year\u201d into a more egalitarian future. In the US, it has become an almost compulsory campaign stop for women, trans and non-binary political candidates. Three of the women running for president have visited in the past year, and a Wing spokesperson told me that the other two \u2013 front-runner Elizabeth Warren and Senator Amy Klobuchar \u2013 are actively discussing doing so. The company\u2019s corporate ranks are stacked with former Democratic political operatives who worked on Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaigns or in the Obama administration. To belong to The Wing is to join this in-crowd, a kind of utopian shadow government. \u201cThere\u2019s a secret smile that you share with the other women in the elevator,\u201d said Jess Lee, a partner at the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Sequoia, which led the The Wing\u2019s latest $75m funding round. And it was true \u2013 I found myself giving a look of ambiguous fellowship to the women I encountered in The Wing, and felt a slight twinge of embarrassment at the check-in desk as they swiped their membership cards and glided away, while I announced myself as a journalist, there to report on the workings of their private club. At Moscatello\u2019s event, I laughed and clapped along with the women in the audience as they shared strategies for their political triumph. In the elevator on the way out, an older woman turned to me and two young women and gave us the secret smile. \u201cSo, are you all going to run?\u201d she asked. * * * The Wing opened its doors on 10 October 2016, four weeks before the presidential election. One of the very first events it held was an invitation-only \u201cvery adult sleepover\u201d featuring face masks, monogrammed pyjamas and pillow fights. The next one was a public \u201cphone bank and debate watch party\u201d in partnership with Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, which invited women to spend three hours calling members of the public and urging them to vote the first woman into the Oval Office. Gelman and her co-founder Lauren Kassan hoped that their company would flourish alongside a Clinton administration, buoyed by the arrival of feminism\u2019s golden age. On election night, about 175 women gathered in the Wing\u2019s Flatiron location to watch the results come in. Like just about everyone else in New York, they expected it would be a celebratory event, a coronation. But as the evening drew on, and it became increasingly clear that Clinton was not going to win, the mood shifted. \u201cOh my goodness, you could feel it getting colder,\u201d says No\u00ebl Duan, a Wing founding member. At one point, Gelman, wearing a backwards baseball cap and a pink \u201cMadam President\u201d T-shirt, sat down and held Duan\u2019s hand. The Wing was heavily aligned with Clinton, yet among the Democratic party\u2019s young, progressive voters, Clinton\u2019s strain of establishment politics was swiftly disavowed. In no time at all, the former secretary of state had become both a feminist martyr and a political liability, a flawed candidate whose defeat everyone felt they should have seen coming. Almost everyone I spoke to about the company said it would be a different place if Clinton had won. Instead of being just a beautiful space for women to revel beneath a shattered glass ceiling, it became, for its members, a place to take shelter. \u201cIt was a really sobering moment,\u201d Kassan told me. \u201cI think there was already the demand and excitement, and I think that we realised just how important it was now.\u201d A few days later, The Wing briefly opened its doors to all women who felt they needed a place to regroup. Gelman and Kassan gave the organisers of the Women\u2019s March on Washington access to the space, and in January, they hired buses to take 100 Wing members to Washington to participate. The Wing began to emphasise civic and political programming, ramped up hiring and continued planning to expand. In interviews, Gelman has articulated the mission in overtly political terms: \u201cBeing a girl is no longer politically neutral. Your identity, whether you like it or not, is now political,\u201d she told Elle in 2017. Clinton\u2019s loss marked the unravelling of the already tenuous coalition of American feminists. The 2017 Women\u2019s March was the largest single-day protest in US history, but it quickly became known more for its controversy and in-fighting than for its transformative politics. The Wing was born into a world in which women were banding together in new and enlivening ways, but often doing so in competing camps. To many, Clinton\u2019s Sandbergian, \u201cLean In\u201d brand of corporate feminism had been fully discredited and a more radical approach was needed, while others felt that the emergency of President Trump in the White House meant that this was a time for progressives to unite, rather than pursue potentially divisive new policies. The Wing has found itself trying to please all sides, in the process finding itself attacked from all sides, often within its own walls. It is an easy target, and the fact that it is owned and operated by women makes it all the more so. Where its programming and brand have conflicted with the aims of progressive politics, its members have called the company out. Yet anyone who criticises The Wing may expect to be swiftly criticised in turn, on one side for poking holes in an otherwise admirable project, and on the other for paying it any attention at all. All parties involved might expect their exchange to be followed by a polite reminder of the specific actions that The Wing has taken to respond to the initial criticism, and perhaps an invitation to continue their discussion in a panel event. To begin to reckon with The Wing\u2019s project is to risk entering an \u201couroboros of doom\u201d, as the writer and illustrator Shelby Lorman put it. \u201cIt feels like such a perfect metaphor,\u201d she said, for the many tangled and charged disagreements over what it means to be a modern woman, feminist and political subject. * * * Before any woman sets foot in The Wing, she will, in all likelihood, already know what it looks like. Every corner of every branch seems to have been designed specifically for Instagram, which is to say that the furniture and art and food and plants and people feel as if they have been carefully chosen to telegraph that they are coveted, consumable goods. The company posts mock-ups of every new space months before it is built, so that women between the ages of 26 to 35 living in major metropolitan areas and possessing roughly $2,000 of annual disposable income can begin to imagine themselves wandering around there. (The company\u2019s omnipresence on social media is another reminder that its power derives from not letting everyone in and letting everyone know about it.) Every outpost contains careful local touches, and each projects an air of strained yet somewhat soothing whimsy. In the Soho premises in New York, I walked up a set of stairs that read \u201cIt\u2019s not a reach when we climb together\u201d, before settling in to enjoy a \u201cfork the patriarchy\u201d grain bowl on a blue pastel desk. In its Washington DC outpost, located above a spa in Georgetown, one of the toniest corners of the city, there is a conference room named \u201cK Street\u201d, after the city\u2019s main lobbying thoroughfare, and a phone booth named after Anita Hill, \u201clegal eagle\u201d. The Wing London, a five-storey penthouse in Fitzrovia, will offer a tearoom, terrace, fitness room and floral patterned tile floors, as well as a portrait gallery featuring the likenesses of Diane Abbott, Mary Beard and Amal Clooney, among others. It is the first members\u2019 club in London that has signed on to the mayor\u2019s living-wage pact, and proceeds from its cafe and its programming will benefit local charities. There will be trellises, black-and-white tiles and chandeliers. \u201cI was very inspired by the British countryside,\u201d Laetitia Gorra, the company\u2019s director of interiors, told me. Walking through one of the Wing\u2019s premises can sometimes feel like exploring what would happen if Oliver Bonas were to design a luxury corporate office: lots of pastel and very few sharp edges. The walls, cushions and seating offer an array of muted pink, mustard and rose-gold hues, a colour scheme chosen in part for its calming effect. The air conditioning is usually set at 22C (72F), to accommodate women\u2019s slightly lower skin temperatures. Chiara de Rege, who helped design the first few locations, said that the goal was to make them \u201cfeminine, but not girly girl or precious\u201d. Hilary Koyfman, who collaborated with De Rege on the early design, has described the overall aesthetic as \u201ckind of like Mad Men \u2013 without the men\u201d. There is certainly something beautiful and powerful, even alchemic, about being in a women-only space. For some women, it is a place to find support, friendship and inspiration, where they do not have to apologise for anything or worry about their things being stolen or their drinks being spiked. Two locations currently offer childcare services, while every location features a private nursing room for new mothers. Each Wing also offers a luxurious beauty room with a wide array of hair and makeup products. These beauty rooms, staff told me, are a key part of the company\u2019s \u201cstorytelling\u201d. They are designed to make life easier, as Gelman once said, for the kind of woman for whom \u201cpart of being successful is not only making sure that you know everything that\u2019s going on in the news and that you\u2019ve responded to every single email in your inbox, and that nothing is on fire in your house, but also looking good because it is what\u2019s expected of you and can make you feel more confident\u201d. Yet, for its critics, this point of articulation is where the alchemy dissolves: instead of being a place that seeks to lift all women up, it becomes a place where one must constantly consider how well one is performing both feminism and femininity. And with any performance, this can be exhausting, and always carries the risk of failure. Spending time at The Wing, I was reminded of the kind of \u201cideal woman\u201d that the writer Jia Tolentino described in a recent essay: she has expensive hair and expensive skin, she is successful and svelte. \u201cToday\u2019s ideal woman is of a type that coexists easily with feminism in its current market-friendly and mainstream form,\u201d she writes. \u201cThis sort of feminism has organised itself around being as visible and appealing to as many people as possible; it has greatly over-valorised women\u2019s individual success.\u201d Some of the tensions within this brand of feminism can be glimpsed, not too surprisingly, at The Wing\u2019s in-house shops, where it sells T-shirts, bags and hats with slogans like \u201ccasual business woman\u201d and \u201cannihilate the patriarchy\u201d on them. There are workout clothes and $17.50 keychains. When I visited the Soho location in early August, the shop was selling a range of colourful award ribbons, printed with lines such as \u201cWow, you\u2019re not sexist\u201d, \u201cBest ally\u201d, and \u201cYou\u2019re my Wingman of the year\u201d. As Jezebel has reported, some of the merchandise resembles that of other feminist artists. The ribbons, for example, seem to be emulating the work of Shelby Lorman, whose book Awards for Good Boys satirises the low standards to which men are held. Lorman first spotted The Wing\u2019s version of the ribbons on Instagram. \u201cI thought it was amazing and hilarious, because they are awards for men, for sale for $6, but they\u2019re stripped of humour, so it\u2019s literal,\u201d she told me. \u201cI truly don\u2019t think that anything could be funnier because if they did borrow my work, they have totally missed the point. And they are monetising the missed point, which is kind of genius. It\u2019s so sinister and so evil that I kind of love it.\u201d * * * Ever since it first opened its doors, The Wing has struggled to define who exactly it is for. Its representatives, describing its membership policy, use the words \u201cexclusive\u201d and \u201cinclusive\u201d in the same breath. No one gets rejected, they told me. Applicants are merely placed on the waiting list \u2013 35,000 people have applied so far \u2013 when their preferred space is at capacity. Yet, in a 2018 presentation to the New York City Commission on Human Rights, The Wing\u2019s attorneys stated that it is \u201chighly selective\u201d and that \u201conly around 40% of applicants are admitted\u201d. Aspiring members must explain how they have promoted or supported The Wing\u2019s mission of advancing women, and also describe the dinner party of their dreams. The commission was investigating the company for discriminating on the basis of gender. (New York law requires it to investigate any complaint it receives. The investigation closed in March 2019.) At first, the club refused to allow men into its spaces, even as guests. A former employee told me that one of the first things they were taught was how to keep men out: \u201cBlock them with your body, push them to the elevator, push the elevator button.\u201d But outward appearance does not always correlate with gender identity; the employee witnessed instances where individuals who presented themselves to the check-in desk at The Wing were misgendered by staff. In August 2018, a serially litigious 53-year-old man sued The Wing for up to $12m for rejecting his application, claiming that he had been denied entry because of his gender. After the lawsuit was filed, and as a result of conversations with its trans and nonbinary staff and members, The Wing adopted a formal membership policy that would evaluate applicants \u201cbased on their commitment to The Wing\u2019s mission, regardless of their perceived gender or gender identity\u201d. In a letter to members announcing the new policy, Kassan and Gelman wrote that they would be \u201cworking to actively incorporate the perspective of trans and non-binary members into our offerings\u201d. The language of guest emails was changed from \u201cshe\u2019s landed\u201d to \u201cthey\u2019ve landed.\u201d The policy also meant that men could enter the space as guests and apply for membership, if they really wanted to. The company\u2019s success is partly due to the fact that, over the past five years, the identity-based members club has emerged as a powerful trend. In the US, The Wing already has too many competitors and imitators to list, which have names such as The Lola (Atlanta), The Broad (Richmond), The Assembly (San Francisco), The Riveter (Seattle) and The Hivery (Mill Valley). In London, women\u2019s clubs such as The AllBright and The Trouble Club already occupy part of The Wing\u2019s target audience. In November, Ethel\u2019s Club, \u201cthe first private social and wellness club designed with people of colour in mind\u201d, will open its doors in Brooklyn. \u201cThe Wing was created for a certain type of woman, which, from my point of view, is not for me,\u201d Ethel\u2019s Club founder, Najla Austin, told me. \u201cI\u2019m looking for my people. It\u2019s not unlike religion. If you write down the similarities of Catholicism and a social club, they\u2019re not that different.\u201d Akilah Cadet, who runs a diversity and inclusion consulting firm in Oakland, had a similar first impression of The Wing, and decided that it probably was not for her. But then Yari Blanco, at the time The Wing\u2019s senior manager of culture and diversity, reached out to her about her work, and Cadet decided to join the club. Being a member, she rightly predicted, would bring in business. \u201cHonestly, my objective was like, get this money, so that\u2019s what I did,\u201d she told me. She said her application to the San Francisco location was fast-tracked, and soon she found herself at an event thrown specifically for black women. At one point, a white woman stood up on the couch and announced that they would be giving away T-shirts reading \u201cphenomenally black\u201d. Cadet raised her concerns about the event to Blanco and her team, criticising what she perceived to be a lack of serious thought about the way the event was organised. Two days later, she found herself on a panel at The Wing sponsored by Secret deodorant, where she got a new client. The company has made similar missteps along the way, and has almost always made concerted efforts to correct them wherever they arise. No\u00ebl Duan, the founding member from New York, who is Chinese American, told me that when The Wing held an event for Asian women, they posted an Instagram story intended to celebrate the club\u2019s \u201cwomen from Asia\u201d. Duan did not attend, but some of her friends did. \u201cThey were like: we\u2019re not women from Asia, we\u2019re American,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I really love about Wing members is that they are willing to speak out, including against the company,\u201d Duan added, noting that the company had changed in response to criticism. \u201cI can see from personal experience that it has come a long way since they first launched,\u201d she said. Cadet took it upon herself to point out instances where The Wing could be more attentive to diversity and difference. Eventually, she was doing so much work for The Wing that she said they offered her a complimentary membership, and she frequently used the space to hold meetings in San Francisco. Like many of its critics, Cadet tries to view the company with generosity. Lately, however, maintaining this nuanced view has come to require a more intricate set of mental gymnastics. At the end of May, a racial confrontation occurred at the West Hollywood branch. According to reporting by the online magazine Zora, Wing member Asha Grant, the director of The Free Black Women\u2019s Library Los Angeles, and her guest were harassed in the parking lot by \u201can unaccompanied white woman guest\u201d who began yelling at them after Grant took what she felt was her parking space. The harassment and racist threats continued inside, where the white woman gave the middle finger to Grant, her guest, and another black club member, Stephanie Kimou. In an attempt to ease the situation, staff offered Kimou, Grant and her guest a free meal, but the white woman was not asked to leave the premises. News of the incident spread quickly. In mid-August, Kimou and Grant posted on Instagram announcing that they were cancelling their memberships. \u201cAfter the initial allure of their perfectly designed co-working spaces, beauty rooms stocked full of Glossier and Goop, the lattes and their \u2018commitment to diversity\u2019, the facade started to crack and what was underneath all that pink felt oppressive and debilitating,\u201d Kimou wrote in her post. Other black members began quitting The Wing. \u201cThey didn\u2019t think it was going to get to this level,\u201d Cadet told me. On 5 September, Gelman and Kassan sent an email to all Wing members that finally acknowledged what had occurred: \u201cOur handling of it left everyone feeling disappointed, and the black member felt especially unprotected and let down,\u201d they wrote. In the following weeks, they would hold gatherings in every city \u201cwith the goal of improving community understanding and mutual trust\u201d, which the executive team would attend. Eleven days later, members received another email from Kassan and Gelman in which they apologised for \u201cthe ways we\u2019ve fallen short\u201d, and made commitments to pay more attention to racial inclusion, including reworking the club\u2019s code of conduct and changing member orientation to address issues of race and racial empathy. Two days after that, on 18 September, Gelman appeared on the cover of Inc. magazine in a long-sleeve black knit dress, her hands resting on her pregnant torso. She became the first visibly pregnant CEO to grace the cover of a business magazine. * * * On 6 September, the day after the first email from Gelman and Kassan went out, I visited the company\u2019s new headquarters in the East Village in New York. Zara Rahim, senior director of strategic communications, gave me a tour around the four-storey office, which is located in what was once a hospital for German immigrants and later expanded to include a dedicated women\u2019s wing. In the basement, the only place in the building where I spotted several men, the tech team was hard at work. Upstairs, we popped our heads into a mint-green conference room, where a planning meeting for the London launch was underway. Rahim and I settled into a couch in Kassan\u2019s office, where Kassan greeted us wearing a yellow plaid jacquard blazer and a logo necklace bearing The Wing\u2019s \u201chero W\u201d, which looks something like the Wonder Woman logo, but softer, rounder, cuter. While Gelman, as CEO, is the public face of the company, Kassan, as COO, tends to handle operations behind the scenes. Before this venture, Kassan was the first employee at the fitness chain SLT, which specialises in high-intensity reformer pilates (motto: \u201cbetter sore than sorry\u201d), and then moved on to Classpass, a fitness class app. She rarely gives interviews, but by the time we spoke, Gelman was busy preparing to go on maternity leave and Kassan was taking over some of her duties. Kassan was excited for the London launch, which she told me had been years in the making. She would be bringing her whole family over to celebrate the opening. I asked her about the recent email to members and about the common criticisms of the company. Diversity had been \u201ca part of who we are and what we\u2019ve cared about since the beginning\u201d, she explained. \u201cThat shows up through our programming and through our products. When things happen, we want to be transparent and clear about that \u2026 because there are things that happen outside in the world that we can\u2019t control. And we want to create a space to be able to have these honest and hard conversations.\u201d Kassan had less time for the criticism that membership is too expensive. \u201cI think the price point is just\u201d \u2013 she lowered her voice to a whisper \u2013 \u201cbullshit.\u201d The Wing is, indeed, more affordable than the vast majority of its competitors. \u201cAs women, we undervalue what we\u2019re providing and serving,\u201d Kassan said. \u201cWe get criticised about that, and we feel proud of what we\u2019re doing.\u201d In London, membership will cost \u00a3170 per month for access to a single location, and \u00a3240 for access to all locations. Approximately 7% of Wing members are awarded scholarships, which last for two years and cover the full cost of membership, and the company is planning tiered membership rates to expand access in the future. The more time I spent speaking to the company\u2019s critics and supporters, the clearer it became that the controversy it generates has far more to do with what it claims to be rather than what it actually is. Last month, for instance, it debuted a members-only job marketplace that allows members to post listings and hire one another. From a business perspective, this is a savvy move \u2013 giving ambitious women yet another reason to want to join, while connecting bosses who are members with a pool of promising candidates. But this is a very narrow vision of feminism. Of course, many talented people will gain new opportunities through this service but, equally obviously, its exclusivity threatens to exacerbate the same kinds of inequality that The Wing claims to want to combat. \u201cFeminism, for me, is fundamentally about collective struggle, not individuals,\u201d says Sarah Banet-Weiser, a scholar of communication and gender studies at the London School of Economics. The Wing\u2019s strain of feminism, she argued, is something else: \u201cThey\u2019re empowering women to be better economic subjects within capitalism, empowering women to network, to get a raise, to address the pay gap. Those are real things, but they are really tied to capitalist logic.\u201d As a former employee put it, The Wing\u2019s feminism is less about making the world more equitable as it is about making sure women are given equal opportunities to make money: \u201cIt\u2019s like, you only make $1m? Well, this man makes $2m! You could make $2m if only it weren\u2019t for misogyny.\u201d (One recent post from The Wing\u2019s Instagram feed read: \u201cMood: CE0,000,000\u201d.) Progressives often talk about The Wing in the same way they talk about the Democratic party: it\u2019s not great but maybe things will get better, maybe the politicians will figure it out, maybe the world The Wing\u2019s founders imagined they would serve will one day emerge. One vocal supporter of The Wing is, somewhat surprisingly, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Gelman hosted a fundraiser for Ocasio-Cortez at her home in Brooklyn last summer and, a few months later, the politician told Glamour: \u201cThe Wing isn\u2019t just a functional space, it\u2019s a real symbol of what\u2019s happening in our country.\u201d She called the company \u201cone of the most potent forces that we\u2019ve seen emerge in politics this year.\u201d Many of the people I spoke to for this piece were disappointed in The Wing for a variety of reasons, but hesitant to publicly criticise it. They had made good friends there, and saw all the work that staff were putting in to make it a better place. They had low expectations for corporate behaviour, and saw The Wing doing a better job than most companies when it comes to addressing its failures. They understood the paradox of a company whose profitability rests upon both expanding its tent and guarding the entrances. \u201cI really wonder what the plan is to grow while staying true to their values,\u201d one San Francisco-based member told me. \u201cMaybe they have something up their sleeve, they have a ton of really smart women working for that company, but I don\u2019t see it.\u201d Cadet also felt burned out by her experience. \u201cI want this to go well. I want this to be a good thing,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe I\u2019ve done all that I can do.\u201d (\u201cAnd when you write that, say that I was gazing off into the distance,\u201d she joked.) The opening of the London branch comes as The Wing seems to be reckoning with its first few years. Last week, The Wing unveiled a mural advertisement on a street corner in Shoreditch in east London. In a bright coral hue, it introduces The Wing as \u201cthe first place in London to solve the dual epidemic of mansplaining and manspreading\u201d. After it went up, Rahim texted me a photo of a handful of men and women pausing in front of it, presumably wondering what a thing called The Wing could be and what it might become. \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

Karen Betts, SWA chief executive, said: \u201cAlongside American whiskey companies, we have called on the UK, US and EU governments for many months now to find a negotiated solution to the trade disputes that have given rise to these tit-for-tat tariffs, and to ensure that duty-free trade can resume between the UK and the US to the benefit of whisky producers, their employees, the communities we work in, and consumers everywhere.\u201d",

Following a 2017 conference, 27 psychiatrists, psychologists and other mental health experts wrote a book, The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/07/donald-trump-dangerous-psychiatrist\" title=\"\">arguing</a> it was their moral and civic \u201cduty to warn\u201d America that \u201cfor psychological reasons\u201d, Trump was \u201cmore dangerous than any president in history\u201d. They diagnosed him with everything from \u201csevere character pathology\u201d to \u201cdelusional disorder\u201d, which can be added to the <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/10/george-conway-trump-unfit-office/599128/\" title=\"\">more common verdicts</a> of \u201cnarcissistic personality disorder\u201d and \u201cantisocial personality disorder\u201d which are regularly offered.</p> \n<p>His behaviour and comments over the past fortnight would appear to not only confirm these conclusions, but to suggest his condition is deteriorating. There has been the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/15/harry-dunn-parents-trump-white-house-anne-sacoolas\" title=\"\">appalling treatment</a> of Harry Dunn\u2019s parents, and his reference to his own \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/07/trump-memes-unmatched-wisdom-claim-twitter-syria-decision\" title=\"\">great and unmatched wisdom</a>\u201d. He sent a letter to the Turkish president, Recep Erdo\u011fan, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-world-is-staring-at-trump-mouth-agape/2019/10/16/5f861f88-f05a-11e9-8693-f487e46784aa_story.html\" title=\"\">warning him</a>: \u201cDon\u2019t be a tough guy. Don\u2019t be a fool. I will call you later.\u201d On Wednesday, in a <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2019/10/16/politics/fact-check-trump-12-false-claims-italian-president/index.html\" title=\"\">single press conference</a> with the Italian president, Sergio Mattarella, he attacked Google, Amazon, Germany, France, Spain, his guest and the European Union, as well as several US intelligence and law enforcement officials.</p> \n<p>Later that day, Democratic leaders walked out of a White House meeting with him after he continually insulted them. But not before he told House speaker Nancy Pelosi: \u201cI hate Isis more than you do,\u201d and claimed \u201cI captured Isis \u2026 in one month.\u201d</p> \n<p>As the threat of impeachment leaves him more isolated, and an election he may lose makes him more vulnerable, we can expect more bizarre behaviour and, consequently, more attempts to frame his actions as those of an unstable and unhinged despot. Such depictions are tempting. They should also be resisted.</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s state of mind is, of course, relevant. He is the commander-in-chief of the most powerful military forces in the world. He has the nuclear codes. He is impulsive and capricious. He lies constantly, unashamedly and apparently compulsively. It is deeply worrying that the executive powers of the presidency lie in the hands of a man who is at one and the same time so brittle, aggressive, vindictive, ridiculous and self-obsessed. His decision to abandon a longstanding ally in Kurdistan and pull US troops out of Syria, against all military advice, is a case in point.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"dbf851ff-8baf-4248-938b-9937b7867104\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UqaYLCyhW7E?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>But to reduce his presidency to this \u2013 one man and his frail mind \u2013 is to ignore how he got there, all he has said and done since he has been there, and how he remains there. (It also risks reducing mental health to a lazy slur.) Just because he believes he will go down in history as a great man doesn\u2019t mean we have to subscribe to the \u201cgreat man theory of history\u201d \u2013 the theory which claims events are moulded not by ordinary people, social movements and economic processes, but by key individuals who stamp their will on the world through force of personality.</p> \n<p>For along with Trump\u2019s personal frailties is a series of political characteristics that underpins his anomie. He is a misogynist, a racist, a xenophobe and a nationalist. Those are not psychological descriptors but political ones, fortified by systems and ideology.</p> \n<p>As such, his behaviour has been irascible but hardly erratic. The rhetorical objects of his disdain are not random. He has not lashed out at the National Rifle Association, the religious right or white people. Politically, his tantrums invariably find their mark in the weak, the poor, the dark, the female, the Muslim, the marginalised and the foreigner. (He will attack powerful people, but not simply for existing. They must cross him first.)</p> \n<p>These inclinations were clear when he stood for the presidency. He has been every bit as bigoted, undisciplined, indiscreet, thin-skinned and braggadocious as his campaign promised. And he won.</p> \n<p>This was not because people didn\u2019t see those things, but because they either didn\u2019t care, cared about other things more, preferred him to the alternative, or simply didn\u2019t show up. As such, his victory marked a high point for the naked appeal of white supremacy in particular and rightwing populism in general, and a low point for the centre-left, neoliberal agenda.</p> \n<p>True, he did not win the popular vote, but nonetheless close to 63 million people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/18/american-non-voters-election-donald-trump\" title=\"\">voted for him</a>. True, his party lost the House of Representatives in the 2018 mid-term elections. But they also gained two seats in the Senate \u2013 the first time the party holding the presidency has achieved that since 2002 \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/06/midterm-elections-trump-pathologies\" title=\"\">in the wake of</a> a synagogue shooting and mail-bomb attacks inspired by his rhetoric. True, more than half of the country wants to impeach him; but <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-10-14/donald-trump-s-approval-rating-is-holding-up-but-why\" title=\"\">about 40%</a> still approve of the job he\u2019s doing. The one thing that stands between him and impeachment is the party behind him in both houses.</p> \n<p>Even his thuggish \u201cAmerica first\u201d foreign policy stands as part of a tradition.

      "bodyText": "While writing a New Yorker profile on Donald Trump in the late 1990s, Mark Singer attempted to discover something about the businessman\u2019s private thoughts, as opposed to his outsized, public persona. When Singer asked him what he thought about when shaving in front of the mirror, Trump did not really understand the question. \u201cOK, I guess I\u2019m asking, \u2018do you consider yourself ideal company?\u2019\u201d Singer said. \u201cYou really want to know what I consider ideal company?\u201d replied Trump. \u201cA total piece of ass.\u201d Divining, assessing and adjudicating the mental health of this US president has become more than just a parlour game. Following a 2017 conference, 27 psychiatrists, psychologists and other mental health experts wrote a book, The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump, arguing it was their moral and civic \u201cduty to warn\u201d America that \u201cfor psychological reasons\u201d, Trump was \u201cmore dangerous than any president in history\u201d. They diagnosed him with everything from \u201csevere character pathology\u201d to \u201cdelusional disorder\u201d, which can be added to the more common verdicts of \u201cnarcissistic personality disorder\u201d and \u201cantisocial personality disorder\u201d which are regularly offered. His behaviour and comments over the past fortnight would appear to not only confirm these conclusions, but to suggest his condition is deteriorating. There has been the appalling treatment of Harry Dunn\u2019s parents, and his reference to his own \u201cgreat and unmatched wisdom\u201d. He sent a letter to the Turkish president, Recep Erdo\u011fan, warning him: \u201cDon\u2019t be a tough guy. Don\u2019t be a fool. I will call you later.\u201d On Wednesday, in a single press conference with the Italian president, Sergio Mattarella, he attacked Google, Amazon, Germany, France, Spain, his guest and the European Union, as well as several US intelligence and law enforcement officials. Later that day, Democratic leaders walked out of a White House meeting with him after he continually insulted them. But not before he told House speaker Nancy Pelosi: \u201cI hate Isis more than you do,\u201d and claimed \u201cI captured Isis \u2026 in one month.\u201d As the threat of impeachment leaves him more isolated, and an election he may lose makes him more vulnerable, we can expect more bizarre behaviour and, consequently, more attempts to frame his actions as those of an unstable and unhinged despot. Such depictions are tempting. They should also be resisted. Trump\u2019s state of mind is, of course, relevant. He is the commander-in-chief of the most powerful military forces in the world. He has the nuclear codes. He is impulsive and capricious. He lies constantly, unashamedly and apparently compulsively. It is deeply worrying that the executive powers of the presidency lie in the hands of a man who is at one and the same time so brittle, aggressive, vindictive, ridiculous and self-obsessed. His decision to abandon a longstanding ally in Kurdistan and pull US troops out of Syria, against all military advice, is a case in point. But to reduce his presidency to this \u2013 one man and his frail mind \u2013 is to ignore how he got there, all he has said and done since he has been there, and how he remains there. (It also risks reducing mental health to a lazy slur.) Just because he believes he will go down in history as a great man doesn\u2019t mean we have to subscribe to the \u201cgreat man theory of history\u201d \u2013 the theory which claims events are moulded not by ordinary people, social movements and economic processes, but by key individuals who stamp their will on the world through force of personality. For along with Trump\u2019s personal frailties is a series of political characteristics that underpins his anomie. He is a misogynist, a racist, a xenophobe and a nationalist. Those are not psychological descriptors but political ones, fortified by systems and ideology. As such, his behaviour has been irascible but hardly erratic. The rhetorical objects of his disdain are not random. He has not lashed out at the National Rifle Association, the religious right or white people. Politically, his tantrums invariably find their mark in the weak, the poor, the dark, the female, the Muslim, the marginalised and the foreigner. (He will attack powerful people, but not simply for existing. They must cross him first.) These inclinations were clear when he stood for the presidency. He has been every bit as bigoted, undisciplined, indiscreet, thin-skinned and braggadocious as his campaign promised. And he won. This was not because people didn\u2019t see those things, but because they either didn\u2019t care, cared about other things more, preferred him to the alternative, or simply didn\u2019t show up. As such, his victory marked a high point for the naked appeal of white supremacy in particular and rightwing populism in general, and a low point for the centre-left, neoliberal agenda. True, he did not win the popular vote, but nonetheless close to 63 million people voted for him. True, his party lost the House of Representatives in the 2018 mid-term elections. But they also gained two seats in the Senate \u2013 the first time the party holding the presidency has achieved that since 2002 \u2013 in the wake of a synagogue shooting and mail-bomb attacks inspired by his rhetoric. True, more than half of the country wants to impeach him; but about 40% still approve of the job he\u2019s doing. The one thing that stands between him and impeachment is the party behind him in both houses. Even his thuggish \u201cAmerica first\u201d foreign policy stands as part of a tradition. In 1964, when the Greek ambassador tried to point out the shortcomings of the US plan to partition Cyprus, President Lyndon Johnson replied: \u201cFuck your parliament and your constitution \u2026 We pay a lot of good American dollars to the Greeks, Mr Ambassador. If your prime minister gives me talk about democracy, parliament and constitution he, his parliament and his constitution may not last long.\u201d He would never have put that in a letter. But three years later, Greece was under a brutal military junta backed by the US from which it did not emerge for seven years. In other words, this particular form of insanity \u2013 if that is what it is \u2013 enjoys mass, if not majority, support, institutional defence and historical precedent. It is the mindset of more than just an individual. Trump\u2019s presence serves a purpose and interests. If he is a lone wolf, how do we explain the likes of Boris Johnson or Silvio Berlusconi, who share so many of his \u201cidiosyncratic traits\u201d, from accusations of sexual harassment to a cavalier attitude towards democratic norms and casual racism. \u201cThe great man of the age,\u201d wrote Friedrich Hegel \u2013 using \u201cgreat\u201d to mean powerful rather than wonderful \u2013 \u201cis the one who can put into words the will of his age, tell his age what its will is, and accomplish it. What he does is the heart and essence of his age; he actualises his age.\u201d As such, in his desire to blame everyone but himself, in his lies, bullying, despotism, insecurity, ineptitude, cheating, scapegoating, preening self-regard, vanity and ignorance, Trump is an emblem of the free-market, white supremacist nationalism that is ascendant in this moment. Ultimately there may be a medical or therapeutic intervention that can help him; but only a political intervention can help us get rid of him. \u2022 Gary Younge is a Guardian columnist \u2022 This article was amended on 18 October 2019 to correct an indiscrete/indiscreet homophone",

Within less than a week we\u2019ve had animal cruelty charges around jiggers being used in horse racing and at Crown Casino even more allegations about money laundering, along with alleged procurement of drugs and sex workers and avoiding immigration procedures for high rollers. Then on Thursday we have revelations that a man who was sanctioned by the United Nations for assisting a war criminal has been allowed to gamble millions at Crown. Only a few weeks ago there were accusations from whistleblowers that the AFL was getting favourable treatment from the gambling regulator, the Victorian Commission for Gambling and Liquor Regulation (VCGLR), in its investigations of gambling by players. The whistleblowers must be going blue in the face from making all these sordid allegations, yet the Victorian government continues to fail to take any real action against the gambling industry. Couple all this with how influential the Australian Hotels Association (AHA) can be when it comes to elections; the AHA imposed a special one-off levy on pub poker machines to help bankroll donations of at least $500,000 to Labor and about $300,000 to the Coalition parties in the Victorian election last year.

BHP\u2019s board recommended shareholders vote against the resolution at its annual meeting in London, but 22% of shareholders voted in favour, with another 7% abstaining. While the resolution failed, campaigners are seeing the strength of the vote as a sign pressure is building on both BHP and the Minerals Council of Australia to bring their advocacy in line with the Paris goal of keeping global heating \u201cwell below 2C\u201d. In the spotlight is BHP\u2019s membership of the Minerals Council and the associated Coal 21 \u2013 an industry-funded group that was set up to develop lower-emissions technology but which has spent millions on pro-coal advertising. The resolution recommended BHP suspend memberships of any industry group which, since January 2018, had carried out advocacy that \u201cdemonstrated, on balance, inconsistency with the Paris agreement\u2019s goals.\u201d In a speech before the vote, BHP\u2019s CEO, Andrew Mackenzie, said mining trade associations \u201cdeserve our full engagement\u201d. He said: \u201cThe move to renewables demands a multifold increase in the production of metals in the decades ahead, which makes mining one of the most vital components of our low-carbon future. \u201cAt a time of increased focus on local solidarity, protection and intervention, in response to increased insecurity and global changes, it\u2019s our participation in industry associations which can contribute to the more global solutions also required for a more progressive world.\u201d He said a taskforce he led across the mining industry was working to make \u201cour vehicles greener and safer\u201d and that this \u201ctypifies the vast bulk of the work of all the trade associations we join and we work tirelessly to make sure this kind of work is their major and predominant role.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In a July speech, Mackenzie said the world\u2019s dependence on fossil fuels \u201ccarries risks with it that could be existential\u201d. In its notice to shareholders before the meeting, BHP reiterated it was still reviewing its industry association memberships, with the outcomes of the review to be released before the end of 2019. The scope of that review had changed from a previous review to include the company\u2019s membership of Coal 21. A previous 2017 review saw BHP leave the World Coal Association but staying with the Minerals Council to work with it on new climate and energy policy positions. Brynn O\u2019Brien, executive director of the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, which organised the resolution, described the vote as \u201cphenomenal\u201d and said it showed a transformation was under way. The centre argued in supporting statements to the meeting that the Minerals Council, Coal 21, and other industry groups BHP was a member of had carried out advocacy that was not consistent with the Paris goals. O\u2019Brien said: \u201cThat companies should suspend funding to organisations that undertake lobbying counter to the goal of a habitable planet is an idea whose time has well and truly come. \u201cBHP should reconsider its position in advance of the BHP Group Ltd AGM in Sydney on 7 November.\u201d \u201cEvery single trade association that lobbies to undermine the goals of the Paris Agreement is on notice: your time is up.\u201d Earlier this month, Australia\u2019s biggest superannuation fund warned the MCA its updated climate policy did not go far enough in explaining how its members were working towards climate goals. The Minerals Council has pledged to release a \u201cclimate action plan\u201d in 2020 that its chief executive, Tania Constable, said would \u201csupport strong and innovative action by Australia\u2019s world-leading minerals sector to address human-induced climate change.\u201d In September, a report from UK-based thinktank InfluenceMap named the Minerals Council of Australia as \u201cone of the top 10 most obstructive trade associations\u201d globally on climate policy.",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson\u2019s progress in getting his Brexit deal dominates the front pages, though most papers make clear it is not a done deal. The Times is perhaps the most optimistic with: \u201cFinal hurdle in sight as Johnson gets his deal\u201d. The paper says \u201cBoris Johnson flew back from Brussels with a Brexit deal last night and will spend the next 24 hours frantically trying to sell it to MPs before a historic Saturday sitting of the Commons.\u201d The Telegraph says Johnson will deliver an ultimatum to MPs that \u201cIt\u2019s my deal or no deal\u201d ahead of the vote, \u201csuggesting there would be no further Brexit extension\u201d. The pro-Brexit, pro-PM paper says Johnson \u201cfaces a plot by a Remain alliance of opposition MPs and Tory rebels to make the deal conditional on a second referendum\u201d. The Guardian reports: \u201cJohnson gets his Brexit deal \u2013 now it\u2019s a numbers game\u201d. The paper says that Johnson \u201cis \u2018very confident\u2019 his Brexit deal will be approved by the House of Commons in a historic knife-edge vote tomorrow\u201d despite the DUP\u2019s refusal to give its backing. Some papers are sounding warnings to MPs to vote for the deal. Among the most vocal is the Daily Mail, which says: \u201cAgainst all odds, Boris has won a new Brexit deal \u2013 yet tomorrow our reckless political class may derail it. So today the Mail says \u2026 He\u2019s done his duty. Now MPs must do theirs\u201d. The Sun also has a strong message to \u201cdithering MPs\u201d \u2013 \u201cGet real \u2026 take the deal!\u201d The paper\u2019s front page features an editorial in place of a news story, which begins: \u201cBoris Johnson, against all odds and in defiance of his sneering critics, has pulled off a vastly improved deal. The Sun urges every MP: back it tomorrow and get Brexit done.\u201d The paper says Johnson\u2019s deal \u201cis immeasurably better than Theresa May\u2019s\u201d and will allow Brexit to be delivered for \u201cour divided, paralysed country\u201d. The Express leads on a poll, conducted for the paper, that found \u201c65% of voters want Leave and Remain MPs to \u2018compromise\u2019 and back Boris Johnson\u2019s deal\u201d. The paper\u2019s lead is: \u201cJust do it! That\u2019s the very loud and clear message from the British public to our parliament\u201d. The i focuses on the steps that still need to be taken for Brexit to happen: \u201cJohnson gets his EU deal \u2026 now for the tricky part,\u201d saying the prime minister \u201cfaces huge challenge to win historic Commons vote tomorrow\u201d. The FT also focuses on the uncertainty, saying: \u201cDUP veto threat leaves Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal gamble in the balance\u201d. \u201cBoris Johnson\u2019s hopes of leading Britain out of the EU on October 31 were hanging in the balance last night,\u201d says the paper.

In NSW, racing minister Kevin Anderson said the ABC report would make racing industry members \u201csick to their stomach\u201d, and said the state racing body would also launch an investigation into animal welfare around race horses. \u201cIf animal cruelty legislation has been breached, there are options available,\u201d he said. \u201cAnybody who has either breached the rules of racing or committed animal cruelty should be brought before the courts and feel the full force of the law [and] I don\u2019t believe they have a place in the racing industry so in terms of that report and integrity, that is a matter for whoever [will] put that report together.\u201d The chief executive of the Victoria Racing Club, Neil Wilson, said the footage was \u201chorrific\u201d and the \u201cunacceptable treatment of horses needs to be eradicated\u201d. \u201cThe welfare of horses is the responsibility of everyone associated with the industry and none of us can walk away from what was shown last night.

The racing body\u2019s official data shows around 34 horses every year end up at slaughterhouses \u2013 less than 1% of retiring horses. But the program suggested the number is much higher, despite rules requiring the registration and tracking of horses from their birth to their retirement. \u201cThe racing industry has hidden behind bogus studies they commissioned and data collected from a compulsory retirement form claiming that less than 0.5 per cent of racehorses are sent to slaughter,\u201d Coalition for the Protection of Racehorses spokesman Elio Celotto said. \u201cThey have now been proven wrong and must own up to the fact that they have a serious welfare problem.\u201d The CPR said up to 220 horses are being killed weekly at a Queensland abattoir and on average, 56% are racehorses. \u201cWith another abattoir that also kills horses and another 33 knackeries, we estimate the real number to be more than 10,000 (a year),\u201d Celotto said in a statement. Speaking on radio station 2gb on Friday Racing NSW chief executive Peter V\u2019landys said his organisation was being unfairly tarnished by the reports, and that the organisation spent $2.5m a year rehoming horses. \u201cThis is not happening in NSW ... to be portrayed so unfairly, it was really disturbing,\u201d he said.

      "bodyText": "The independent senator Jacqui Lambie has rebuffed Peter Dutton\u2019s claim that \u201cthe vast majority of veterans\u201d would want her to abolish the medevac laws, as pressure mounts from all sides to secure her crucial swing vote. As expected, a government-heavy Senate inquiry into the legislation recommended repealing the laws, which make it easier for doctors to recommend refugees and asylum seekers on Manus Island and Nauru be transported to Australia for medical treatment. But Centre Alliance, the Greens and Labor members of the committee have all issued dissenting reports calling for the legislation to remain, saying the vast majority of evidence presented to the committee showed the laws saved lives. Lambie holds the deciding vote in the deadlocked Senate, leading the home affairs minister to invoke her history as an army veteran in a public appeal to her on Thursday, claiming veterans would want the laws scrapped. Speaking to Guardian Australia, Lambie disagreed with Dutton\u2019s assessment. \u201cMost vets, or about 99.9% of them, are more concerned about the dysfunction of Veterans Affairs than what they are with medevac,\u201d Lambie said. \u201cAs a matter of fact, I spoke to one of the main service organisations yesterday, and somebody within that [who has] been in the game for a long time and he\u2019s a veteran, he\u2019s Gulf War and he\u2019s East Timor, and he said \u2018what\u2019s this medevac stuff?\u2019,\u201d Lambie said. \u201cSo I have to say, veterans rely on me to have a look at the national security side of it, but I\u2019m certainly not getting phone calls about it, let\u2019s put it that way. \u201cI\u2019m getting hundreds of phone calls from people who want me to know that Veterans Affairs is more dysfunctional than ever. So I\u2019d be more worried about that, if I was Dutton.\u201d Lambie said she would spend the weekend reading the committee\u2019s findings, and continue to meet advocates from all sides, before deciding how she will cast her vote when the Senate reconvenes next month. The government committee report listed what it said was a rash of problems with the laws, including \u201cno process of return\u201d, the time period the minister has to decide whether a transfer applicant was a security risk, \u201csovereignty issues\u201d and the cost of the independent health advice panel, as some of the reasons the legislation should be scrapped. \u201cOf particular concern to the committee is the fact that the medical transfer provisions impose strictly limited grounds for refusal in relation to security and character concerns,\u201d the committee\u2019s official report read. \u201cThe committee understands the minister has already been forced to approve the transfer of six individuals who were \u2018of security or character concern\u2019, because the concerns did not meet the strict grounds upon which the minister may refuse a transfer under the provisions.\u201d But MPs on opposition parties who sat on the committee said nothing was presented that swayed their view that medevac was working as intended. \u201cWhen the provisions were introduced, the government claimed that they were a green light to people smugglers and would result in a new surge of boat arrivals,\u201d the Labor report said. \u201cThat has not happened. \u201cWe argued that it was possible both to maintain rigorous border surveillance and security and to fulfil Australia\u2019s obligation to provide full and appropriate medical care for people detained in Australian\u2011funded facilities. \u201cThat is what the operation of the medevac law has demonstrated. \u201cThese transfer provisions have shown that it is not necessary to resort to cruelty, the abuse of asylum seekers\u2019 rights and the flouting of Australia\u2019s international obligations in order to maintain a strict border protection regime.\u201d The Greens argued the government was putting \u201cpolitical imperatives ahead of people\u2019s medical needs\u201d in a \u201ccrass calculation that some lives are worth sacrificing for broader political outcomes, despite their legal and moral obligations\u201d. \u201cThis calculation should be intolerable in a liberal democracy like Australia,\u201d the Greens report said. \u201cDecisions about medical care should be made by medical experts, not politicians or bureaucrats.\u201d Centre Alliance, which played a crucial role in having the legislation passed, said the government and department did not put forward \u201csufficiently solid grounds for abolishing the Medevac laws\u201d. \u201cThe department argued that the narrow character grounds may not capture everyone of concern but witnesses countered that potential risks can be mitigated,\u201d the party\u2019s report said. \u201cFor instance, those transferred to Australia for medical treatment are detained while they are onshore, and the minister decides whether this is in the community or in a detention centre. As stated by the Law Council, \u2018this means that any potential risk posed to the Australian community will be managed in practice\u2019.\u201d But with a vote now just three or so weeks away, Scott Morrison has increased the pressure, telling Sydney radio host Ray Hadley the medevac laws had damaged Australia\u2019s border protection. The government reopened the Christmas Island detention centre when the legislation passed but then said it would close it, with no additional boats having arrived in Australian waters. After claiming the government had lost the power to stop people judged as security risks from entering Australia for treatment under the legislation, Dutton used the law to deny a known criminal from entering Australia, on national security grounds. But Morrison continued to insist the legislation remained a risk. \u201cThere is this naivety that you can change the rules and they think it won\u2019t have any impact \u2013 well of course it will,\u201d he told radio 2GB. \u201cThe thing about border protection is you\u2019ve got to be consistent, you\u2019ve got to be clear and you\u2019ve got to hold the line. \u201cThe minute you show that you\u2019re prepared to crack it, well, that\u2019s when you start losing and Australia can\u2019t afford to lose on border protection.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Intense fighting has erupted in the Mexican city of Culiac\u00e1n, where masked gunmen threw up burning barricades and traded gunfire with security forces after authorities arrested one of the sons of the jailed former leader of the Sinaloa drug cartel Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n. Mexico\u2019s security minister, Alfonso Durazo, said a patrol by National Guard militarised police first came under attack from within a house in the city, 600 km (370 miles) northwest of Mexico City. After entering the house, they arrested Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez, who is accused of drug trafficking in the United States. However, the patrol was quickly overpowered by cartel gunmen, and the decision was taken to withdraw to protect the lives of the National Guard and restore calm in the city, where gangsters had set up roadblocks and were unleashing heavy automatic gunfire, Durazo said. Images shared on social media showed trucks with mounted heavy machine guns patrolling the city streets. Another clip showed a gunman with an assault rifle shooting at an unknown target against a soundtrack of continuous gunfire. Local media had reported that at least one of the main roads out of the city towards the port of Mazatl\u00e1n had been blocked by a barricade of burning trucks, while others were closed by the army. Photographs were circulating on social media purporting to show Ovidio in detention in a light blue shirt, with what appeared to be religious medallions around his neck. \u201cThe decision was taken to retreat from the house, without Guzman to try to avoid more violence in the area and preserve the lives of our personnel and recover calm in the city,\u201d Durazo said. Thursday\u2019s shootouts initially prompted rumours that they were triggered by the arrest of Iv\u00e1n Archivaldo Guzman Salazar, another of Chapo\u2019s sons. It\u2019s unclear if he was detained. The 28-year-old Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez is one of four children from Chapo\u2019s second marriage. He is named together with his elder brother, Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez, in an indictment related to cocaine trafficking released by the US Department of Justice in February this year. Chapo Guzm\u00e1n had two other wives and at least six more children. The murder of 22-year-old Edgar Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez in a Culiacan parking lot May 2008 sparked a major turf war between Chapo and his former allies from the Beltr\u00e1n Leyva cartel that raged for years. The Sinaloa public security secretary, Crist\u00f3bal Casta\u00f1eda, told Milenio TV that as well as roving shootouts and barricades, the chaos included a mass jailbreak of between 20 and 30 inmates. \u201cWe are inviting people to get off the streets until we have re-established control of the city,\u201d he said. Guzm\u00e1n, whose cartel was once billed as the most powerful drug trafficking organization in the world, was sentenced to life in prison by a US federal court in January. Over the course of decades in the business, the 62-year-old had been arrested three times \u2013 twice in Mexico and once in Guatemala \u2013 and managed to make two spectacular escapes from high-security Mexican jails. Chapo\u2019s second arrest in 2014 took place in the port city of Mazatl\u00e1n without a shot being fired. He was in the company of his third wife and their two baby daughters at the time. Two of the drug lord\u2019s eldest sons, Iv\u00e1n and Jes\u00fas Alfredo Guzm\u00e1n Salazar, have appeared to lead the family\u2019s bid to retain control of the cartel after his final downfall began with his third arrest in January 2016. Both sons were reportedly kidnapped in August of that year from a swanky restaurant in the Pacific resort city of Puerto Vallarta by the Sinaloa cartel\u2019s then up and coming rival the New Generation Jalisco Cartel.

Her back catalogue as a longform journalist includes forays into sexual assault in the AFL (2013\u2019s acclaimed Night Games), and an investigation into the standoffs between environmental activists and forestry businesses in Tasmania (Into the Woods, 2012). So it\u2019s fitting that her debut novel would dive headfirst into contentious territory: Australia\u2019s involvement in the Iraq war, the legacy of the stolen generations and, through the characters she inhabits, the literary world\u2019s evolving conversation around cultural appropriation. Act of Grace is told through three strands of narrative, which intersect over the course of the novel. Toohey is a returned Australian soldier, disgraced after killing an Iraqi child in friendly fire; Robbie is a young Indigenous Australian woman, grappling with her identity through art; and Nasim is an Iraqi refugee to Australia, who became personally embroiled in \u2013 and then fled from \u2013 the atrocities of Saddam Hussein\u2019s reign.

The film, The Laundromat, is due to be released on Netflix at midnight on Friday in the US, and stars Gary Oldman and Antonio Banderas as Jurgen Mossack and Ramon Fonseca. Mossack and Fonseca sued Netflix this week alleging that the film portrayed them as \u201cruthless uncaring lawyers who are involved in money laundering, tax evasion, bribery and/or other criminal conduct\u201d and sought a court ruling preventing the film being released. In a response filed to the US district court in Connecticut on Thursday, Netflix said the request was a \u201cvirtually unheard-of prior restraint on speech\u201d and should be denied. The company said the film, although advertised as \u201cbased on some real shit\u201d, did not try to portray itself as a non-fictional account of the Panama Papers scandal, but was instead a \u201ccomedic morality tale about a system which invites and protects abuse\u201d. \u201cWhile entertaining and largely comedic, it is intended to bring attention to the abuse of offshore shell corporations and tax shelters, and it is an indictment of the legal system that permits them,\u201d Netflix said. Mossack and Fonseca, while given the same names in the film, are \u201cpalpably farcical characters\u201d, Netflix said in the court filing. \u201cThey are cartoonish narrators who set up shell corporations around the world; it does not depict them as direct participants in criminal activity. \u201cRather, the film saves its pointed critiques for the opacity of the global banking system and the systemic corruption of wealthy individuals that permit that system to perpetuate itself.\u201d Netflix said the film portrayed the pair as being \u201clargely oblivious to the ways in which some of the shell entities they have set up are being abused, and it indicts the system for making such enterprises largely, if not entirely, legal\u201d. Netflix argued Mossack and Fonseca had admitted in their own filing that the reputational damage they claimed they might suffer had long since occurred as a result of the media coverage around the 2016 publication of the Panama Papers. \u201cClearly, [their] reputations were sullied long before the release of [The Laundromat].\u201d Judgment in the case was expected to be handed down before the film was due to be made available on Netflix. On Thursday evening, US time, the case was transferred from Connecticut to California. The film will be available on Netflix from midnight Pacific Time. Mossack Fonseca shut down in March last year, two years after the release of the Panama Papers thrust the affairs of their clients onto front pages around the world. The 11.5m documents in the cache named a large number of rich and powerful people, sparking investigations around the world. In addition to the Panamanian charges against Mossack and Fonseca, which they are fighting, four men associated with the firm have been charged with tax crimes in the US.",

      "bodyText": "The musical comedy our climate-denying age requires, Howard Ashman and Alan Menken\u2019s 1982 tale of a plant bent on human destruction blooms again off-Broadway. Funny, schlocky, nutty and sad, it\u2019s a show about falling for (and sometimes into) the wrong guy or the wrong vegetable, but with doo-wop and gonzo puppetry. Little Shop of Horrors is based on a Roger Corman B-movie about a humble flower shop assistant who unknowingly nurses a homicidal succulent. Revived by the director Michael Mayer with heart and sass, the show stars Jonathan Groff (unrecognizable beneath taped-together eyeglasses and bunchy khakis) as Seymour, the beleaguered botanist, and Tammy Blanchard, as Audrey, the tender, Bronx-honking trollop he loves. Audrey wastes her favors on Orin Scrivello, DDS (Christian Borle), a dentist with a creative approach to pain management. A trio of street urchins (Salome Smith, Chelsea Turbin, Joy Woods, cheeky and delightful) suggest that maybe she should just leave him. Audrey gestures with her broken arm. \u201cIf he does this to me when he likes me, imagine what he\u2019d do if he ever got mad,\u201d she says.

The ABC News Breakfast co-host Michael Rowland responded to a personal slur in the Oz by calling the Murdoch broadsheet a \u201cshitty rag\u201d. Its former editor-in-chief and media columnist Chris Mitchell agreed furiously with the Sydney Institute director, Gerard Henderson, the Oz\u2019s associate editor, Chris Kenny, and the Herald Sun columnist Andrew Bolt that \u201cit\u2019s not so much a lack of ethnic diversity [at the ABC] that\u2019s the problem as a lack of political diversity\u201d.

Mitchell was so outraged at the ABC\u2019s approach to \u201cclimate change, renewable power advocacy, opposition to coal and gas extraction, asylum-seeker advocacy and the performance of US president Donald Trump\u201d he suggested the government order the public broadcaster to change. \u201cThe minister for communications, Paul Fletcher, should tell the board this is what taxpayers expect,\u201d he said, ignoring the small matter of the ABC\u2019s independence from government, which is mandated by the ABC Act. \u201cIf the minister provides the ABC with a statement of government policy about broadcasting, then the board will consider it but it\u2019s not enforceable by the minister,\u201d the ABC said. The \u201cshitty rag\u201d may be a little disappointed after picking up just two Walkley nominations, an unfortunate tally for editor-in-chief Chris Dore. The Oz got one for cartoonist Jon Kudelka, who has resigned to join Schwartz Media\u2019s Saturday Paper, and one for associate editor Cameron Stewart for a feature in the Weekend Australian Magazine, \u201cJoe Hockey\u2019s Game\u201d. Senior reporter Ean Higgins was also nominated in the Walkley book award longlist for The Hunt for MH370; as was business writer Damon Kitney for his book The Price of Fortune: The untold story of being James Packer. The ABC was nominated for 16 Walkley awards, including 25 finalists and Nine Entertainment was nominated in 14 categories. Latham losses mount Mark Latham has settled a defamation claim by Mohamed Kamer Nilar Nizamdeen, who sued the One Nation politician over two since-deleted tweets posted after the University of New South Wales PhD student was charged with a terrorism-related offence. It\u2019s the second defamation case involving false allegations of Islamic terrorism the former Labor leader has had to settle. Last year he had to settle with Osman Faruqi, ABC journalist and former Greens candidate, who sued after Latham accused him of \u201caiding and abetting Islamic terrorism\u201d and fostering \u201canti-white racism in Australia\u201d. This week Nizamdeen\u2019s lawyer, Moustafa Kheir, said Latham had settled out of court for an undisclosed sum. Both cases are believed to have cost Latham around $100,000. Latham had already tweeted an apology in April that said Nizamdeen had been falsely accused and that the allegations he had believed at the time were incorrect. \u201cI unreservedly apologise to Mr Nizamdeen and retract the allegations made about him in my tweet.\u201d Q&amp;A answers one question The pieces of the puzzle that is Q&amp;A in 2020 are slowly coming together. An executive producer has been appointed but not a host. Tony Jones\u2019s departure is imminent as he is moving to China, where he will pursue his love of fiction writing. Erin Vincent, the former executive producer of Insiders and News Breakfast, has landed the Q&amp;A gig next year, after the departure of the founding EP, Peter McEvoy, who is finishing up a long career at Aunty that started in 1980 on Triple J. \u201cThe ABC and Australian audiences are indebted to Peter McEvoy for bringing the concept to life more than a decade ago, and I look forward to leading the talented team behind it,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cThe audience is the heart of this show and I can\u2019t wait to find new ways for people to participate in the debate and engage with public figures on the social issues they care about.\u201d The ABC\u2019s news director, Gaven Morris, praised Vincent for increasing the ratings on News Breakfast and signalled that Q&amp;A would evolve. The main difference so far is that Vincent is based in Melbourne and Q&amp;A will be produced out of Melbourne as well as Sydney, joining News Breakfast and Insiders as Victorian productions. Brand corporation The \u201cupfronts\u201d is a term the local TV industry has adopted from the US to describe an annual showcase of programming to spruik its content for media buyers, advertisers and media. Ten unveiled the new MasterChef Australia judges at its upfronts last week, Nine held a major event and after party at Fox Studios on Wednesday, and Seven\u2019s event \u2013 with its new CEO, James Warburton \u2013 will be held next Wednesday.

Nine held 1,300 advertising and media industry members captive at Fox Studios for more than two hours \u2013 with just a bag of popcorn and a can of spring water for sustenance \u2013 as it rolled out celebrity presenters, reality TV contestants, sports stars and endless charts and data to bamboozle the people with money to spend. They promised \u201cconsistency\u201d across 52 weeks in the face of Seven\u2019s 2020 Tokyo Olympics coverage, which the network has promised advertisers will command at least a 60% commercial share. Chief sales officer Michael Stephenson said Nine was the \u201cgreatest marketing platform\u201d for Australian brands since the takeover of Fairfax made it a truly cross-platform offering of TV, digital, radio and print. \u201cFrom our publishing business to the digital assets and of course 9Now, the performance of all of them has been nothing short of outstanding,\u201d he said. Under the Nine family, Domain, Drive, Good Food, Traveller, Good Weekend and Sunday Life are \u201csuper brands\u201d, not just newspaper inserts, and are more valuable than the actual journalism of the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age that underpins them. Last month Nine launched its first cross-platform offering, Your Domain, a one-hour TV program hosted by Shelley Craft and former Your Money host Chris Kohler that extends Domain from a print and digital cash cow into a television cash cow. Nine Entertainment has nominations in 14 categories for this year\u2019s Walkley awards.

The White House released a statement from Mulvaney claiming \u201cthere was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election.\u201d Mulvaney also announced the June G7 summit would be held at Trump\u2019s resort in Doral, Florida, raising concerns that the president is trying to personally profit off his office. Rick Perry, Trump\u2019s energy secretary who has become a central figure in questions over whether the president sought to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, is resigning and will step down by the end of the year. Trump said Perry\u2019s replacement has already been chosen, and will be announced soon. Mike Pence announced the US and Turkey had agreed to a five-day ceasefire in Syria, but Turkey quickly clarified that it was actually just a \u201cpause\u201d in operations. Experts also criticized the deal for being overly deferential to the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. The former commander of US special forces operations argued in an op-ed that Trump is a threat to American democracy, and wrote that US military personnel feel \u201cfrustration, humiliation, anger and fear\u201d that America is \u201cunder attack, not from without, but from within\u201d, because of Trump\u2019s lack of leadership. The US ambassador to the EU, Gordon Sondland, testified in the impeachment inquiry, privately telling House investigators that Trump delegated oversight of Ukraine policy to Rudy Giuliani, his personal lawyer. Fewer than half of Republicans believe that Trump has \u201cdefinitely not\u201d done things that are grounds for impeachment, according to a new poll from Pew Research Center. In his comments today about Kurds living along the Turkish border, Trump \u201cis using the language of ethnic cleansing,\u201d representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez argued. Fox News host and Trump ally Sean Hannity called acting chief of staff Mulvaney \u201cdumb\u201d and \u201cidiotic\u201d after he said in a press conference that there was a political quid pro quo involved in the Trump administration\u2019s holdup of military aid to Ukraine. \u201cI don\u2019t even think he knows what he\u2019s talking about. That\u2019s my take on it,\u201d Hannity said on his radio show, Mediaite reported. The mayor of Doral, Florida, a small town outside of Miami, was taken by surprise by the White House\u2019s announcement that the G7 summit would be held at one of Trump\u2019s own resorts there, the Washington Post reports. The announcement, a clear example of using the power of the presidency to benefit Trump\u2019s private interests, has sparked anger and widespread criticism. In his final hours, Elijah Cummings, the son of sharecroppers who became an influential Democratic congressman from Baltimore, was still working to help immigrants with chronic medical conditions. That\u2019s what members of his staff told Massachusetts congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, she tweeted today. Cummings was 68. There\u2019s been a lot of news, but the New York congresswoman wants to make sure that nobody forgets one of the president\u2019s casual comments today. Elon Musk tweets that he is \u201cgoing offline.\u201d Sounds nice, doesn\u2019t it? Even in the new White House statement denying that he said what he said, acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney doesn\u2019t quite say that there was no political quid pro quo at all involved in the holdup of military aid to Ukraine, journalist Laura Rozen notes: The careful language suggests that the walk back was motivated in particular by the Justice Department\u2019s concerns about what Mulvaney said, Rozen argues. Fewer than half of Republicans believe that Trump has \u201cdefinitely not\u201d done things that are grounds for impeachment, according to a new poll from Pew Research Center. And a full 20% of Republicans said they believe that Trump had \u201cprobably\u201d or \u201cdefinitely\u201d done things that are grounds for impeachment. Over the past month, most Americans have not changed their opinion on whether the House should conduct impeachment proceedings against the president, according to new Pew Research Center results/ Overall, 54% of Americans support House Democrats\u2019 decision to open an impeachment inquiry. The split is largely along partisan lines, with Democrats supportive and Republicans in opposition. But there has been some movement: nearly 1 in 10 adults who opposed impeachment proceedings last month have changed their views to support an inquiry, Pew found. Trump has confirmed that Rick Perry is resigning as energy secretary, and said that Perry\u2019s replacement is a man and \u201cwe\u2019ll be be announcing it very shortly.\u201d The confirmation came as Trump took questions during a visit to a Louis Vuitton workshop in Texas. An earlier version of this post, based on updates from the White House pool reporter, said that Trump was going to announce Perry\u2019s replacement at his rally tonight in Dallas, Texas. It\u2019s not clear if that\u2019s the case: Trump did say that he had planned to announce Perry\u2019s resignation at the rally tonight. Perry will step down \u201ctoward\u201d or \u201cat\u201d the end of the year, Trump said. But the new energy secretary will not be the current governor of Texas, or the current governor of Alaska, he said. Acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney\u2019s comments during a press conference today about the Trump administration\u2019s political reason for delaying military aid to Ukraine sparked pushback from the Department of Justice, angry reactions from Trump advisers, and concern from a key Republican senator. \u201c[Mulvaney] literally said the thing the president and everyone else said did not happen,\u201d an unnamed Trump advisor had told the Washington Post earlier today. Now, the White House has released a statement claiming that Mulvaney did not say what he said. \u201cOnce again, the media has decided to misconstrue my comments to advance a biased and political witch hunt against President Trump. Let me be clear, there was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election,\u201d Mulvaney said in a statement emailed to the White House press corps. According to Mulvaney\u2019s new statement: \u201cThe president never told me to withhold any money until the Ukrainians did anything related to the server. The only reasons we were holding the money was because of concern about lack of support from other nations and concerns over corruption. \u201cThere was never any connection between the funds and the Ukrainians doing anything with the server - this was made explicitly obvious by the fact that the aid money was delivered without any action on the part of the Ukrainians regarding the server.\u201d \u201cThere never was any condition on the flow of the aid related to the matter of the DNC server.\u201d The comments from Trump\u2019s acting chief staff Mick Mulvaney earlier today about a political quid pro quo involved in the delay of military aid to Ukraine are \u201cabsolutely a concern,\u201d Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski said, according to CNN\u2019s Shimon Prokupecz. \u201cYou don\u2019t hold up foreign aid that we had previously appropriated for a political initiative. Period,\u201d Murkowski said. The Alaska Republican, who has broken with the Trump administration at key moments, including on a crucial Obamacare vote, has been labeled \u201cone of eight Republican senators to watch on impeachment,\u201d according to Vox. The youngest child of Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King was not impressed by Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s reference to her civil rights leader father in his speech today defending Facebook\u2019s policies on political misinformation. \u201cI\u2019d like to help Facebook better understand the challenges #MLK faced from disinformation campaigns launched by politicians,\u201d Bernice King wrote on Twitter. \u201cThese campaigns created an atmosphere for his assassination.\u201d \u201cA feigned concern for free expression.\u201d That\u2019s how former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign is responding to Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s speech today at Georgetown, in which the Facebook CEO defended the company\u2019s decision to allow misinformation in political advertising on the platform. \u201cZuckerberg attempted to use the Constitution as a shield for his company\u2019s bottom line, and his choice to cloak Facebook\u2019s policy in a feigned concern for free expression demonstrates how unprepared his company is for this unique moment in our history and how little it has learned over the past few years,\u201d Bill Russo, a campaign spokesman, told The Hill. This is Lois Beckett, in The Guardian\u2019s California office, taking over this evening\u2019s live politics coverage. \u201cI don\u2019t like the Democrats, but Trump is destroying the Republic!\u201d a retired four-star general reportedly exclaimed to another retired commander last week on the parade field at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. That\u2019s what retired Admiral William H. McRaven, who led the United States Special Operations Command from 2011 to 2014, writes in a new op-ed in the New York Times that calls Trump a threat to American democracy. At two high-profile events for American military personnel last week, McRaven writes, \u201cthere was an underlying current of frustration, humiliation, anger and fear that echoed across the sidelines. The America that they believed in was under attack, not from without, but from within.\u201d \u201cIf this president doesn\u2019t demonstrate the leadership that America needs, both domestically and abroad, then it is time for a new person in the Oval Office \u2014 Republican, Democrat or independent \u2014 the sooner, the better. The fate of our Republic depends upon it,\u201d McRaven argues. McRaven is known as the architect of the raid that killed Osama Bin Laden. He has publicly attacked the president before, in a 2018 open letter to the president that ran in the Washington Post, criticizing his decision to revoke the clearance of former CIA director John Brennan, who has criticized Trump\u2019s behavior as \u201ctreasonous\u201d and called him \u201cwholly in the pocket of Putin.\u201d \u201cThrough your actions, you have embarrassed us in the eyes of our children, humiliated us on the world stage and, worst of all, divided us as a nation,\u201d McRaven wrote of Trump last year. \u201cIf you think for a moment that your McCarthy-era tactics will suppress the voices of criticism, you are sadly mistaken.\u201d We\u2019re turning over the blog to our west coast colleague, Lois Beckett, for the next hours to cover more of this very eventful Thursday. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Rick Perry, Trump\u2019s energy secretary who has become a central figure in questions over whether the president sought to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, is reportedly resigning. Mick Mulvaney, the president\u2019s acting chief of staff, confirmed that there was a quid pro quo involved in the delay of military aid to Ukraine, contradicting the president\u2019s repeated denials. But Mulvaney dubiously argued the quid pro quo was acceptable because Trump was seeking an investigation of the 2016 election, not a probe of Biden. Mulvaney announced the June G7 summit would be held at Trump\u2019s resort in Doral, Florida, raising concerns that the president is trying to profit off his office. Mike Pence announced the US and Turkey had agreed to a five-day ceasefire in Syria, but Turkey quickly clarified that it was actually just a \u201cpause\u201d in operations. Experts also criticized the deal for being overly deferential to the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. The US ambassador to the EU, Gordon Sondland, testified in the impeachment inquiry, privately telling House investigators that Trump delegated oversight of Ukraine policy to Rudy Giuliani, his personal lawyer. Lois will have more on the news of the day, so stay tuned. Reports emerged earlier this year that Rick Perry was planning his exit from the Trump administration, but the energy secretary\u2019s embroilment in the Ukraine scandal may have accelerated his departure timeline. Bloomberg News reports: For months, Perry has been paving the way for his likely successor, Deputy Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette, according to a person familiar with the matter. Brouillette has taken a bigger role in some department policy matters, such as natural gas exports, and he has more frequently served as the public face of the agency, including on diplomatic missions to tout American energy to foreign allies. Several key Perry aides also recently departed as the secretary prepares to leave. Trump reportedly intends to lavish praise on Perry tonight during the president\u2019s rally in Texas, where the energy secretary previously served as governor. The New York Times provides more context on Perry\u2019s widely anticipated resignation as Trump\u2019s energy secretary: The Perry resignation had been anticipated for several weeks, even before the news emerged of his involvement in efforts to pressure the new president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, to investigate a company that had worked with Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. In the ensuing weeks, Mr. Perry has been drawn deeper into the questions around the pressure campaign on Mr. Zelensky, which has spurred an impeachment inquiry that threatens to engulf Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency. ... It is not known exactly when Mr. Perry will leave his post, but it is expected soon. The New York Times had earlier reported he would leave by year\u2019s end. The New York Times is now confirming Bloomberg News\u2019 reporting that Trump\u2019s energy secretary, Rick Perry, has told the president he is resigning. The Wall Street Journal reported last night that Perry called Rudy Giuliani at Trump\u2019s direction to discuss the president\u2019s concerns over Ukrainian corruption. The Journal reported: Mr. Perry, in an exclusive interview with The Wall Street Journal, said he contacted Mr. Giuliani in an effort to ease a path to a meeting between Mr. Trump and his new Ukrainian counterpart. He said Mr. Giuliani described to him during their phone call several concerns about Ukraine\u2019s alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. election, concerns that haven\u2019t been substantiated. Mr. Perry also said he never heard the president, any of his appointees, Mr. Giuliani or the Ukrainian regime discuss the possibility of specifically investigating former Vice President Joe Biden, a Democratic presidential contender, and his son Hunter Biden. Mr. Trump\u2019s request for a probe of the Bidens in a July 25 call with Ukraine\u2019s president has sparked the impeachment inquiry in the House. Mr. Giuliani, in an interview, confirmed the spring phone call and said he was telling Mr. Perry to be careful with regards to the new Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky. Rick Perry, the energy secretary who has become embroiled in the Ukraine scandal, has told Trump that he intends to resign, according to Bloomberg News. Perry has become a central figure in questions over whether Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden in an attempt to meddle in the 2020 election. A Republican senator, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, told reporters that she did not think it was appropriate for Trump to host the June G7 summit at one of his Florida resorts. Ethics experts lambasted the decision as a classic example of self-dealing and called on lawmakers to denounce it. From the former director of the office of government ethics: Trump appointed author of Illuminati books to federal education board Just when you thought things couldn\u2019t get weirder: A lawyer based in Colorado Springs, who has been appointed to a federal education board by Donald Trump, is a prolific writer on self-help Illuminati books. George Mentz, who teaches an online course on wealth management for Texas A&amp;M University School of Law, was appointed on the Commission on Presidential Scholars last week. The board, made up of leaders in education, selects distinguished high school seniors for recognition each year. Mentz, who said he\u2019s been a supporter of Trump for years, has written books with some eye-catching titles such as \u201cThe Illuminati Secret Laws of Money\u201d and \u201cThe Illuminati Handbook\u201d, according to the Denver Post. Mentz also owns a company that awards certificates to people for a fee, allowing them to take on titles like \u201ccertified political scientist\u201d and \u201cmaster Islamic financial specialist\u201d. During an interview, Mentz said \u201cjust because I use the word Illuminati, don\u2019t let that get you too excited.\u201d He further clarified: \u201cIf you look the word up, it means \u2018illumination\u2019. \u2026 References to the \u2018Illuminati\u2019 are part of the books\u2019 marketing.\u201d The House of Representatives held a moment for silence for representative Elijah Cummings after the influential chairman of the House oversight committee passed away unexpectedly. Capitol Hill reporters said that there were many lawmakers of both parties tearing up and embracing each other on the floor after the moment of silence concluded. It appears that Trump\u2019s external legal team is now attempting to distance itself from Mick Mulvaney\u2019s press briefing today, where the acting White House chief of staff acknowledged the existence of a quid pro quo in the delaying of military aid to Ukraine. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, told reporters on Capitol Hill that Mick Mulvaney\u2019s admission of a quid pro quo in the delaying of military aid to Ukraine makes the impeachment situation \u201cmuch, much worse.\u201d Mulvaney acknowledged in a press briefing earlier today that Trump withheld the military aid to pressure Ukraine to open an investigation into a debunked conspiracy theory about the 2016 election. Schiff would not comment on whether he would bring Mulvaney in for a deposition, but the House committees investigating impeachment have already requested documents from the acting White House chief of staff. A senior justice department official said that the DOJ was not at all aware of Trump withholding military aid from Ukraine to demand an investigation into a debunked conspiracy theory about the 2016 election, as Mick Mulvaney claimed hours ago. Mulvaney said at a press briefing earlier today that there was indeed a quid pro quo involved in the delay of dispersing military aid to Ukraine, contradicting Trump\u2019s repeated denials. However, the acting White House chief of staff claimed that the quid pro quo was acceptable because it involved an investigation of the 2016 election, not the 2020 election \u2013 a dubious argument, to say the very least. The blog is following news on a number of different fronts today, including the announcement that the G7 summit in June will be held at Trump\u2019s resort in Doral, Florida. The news immediately raised concerns that Trump was attempting to profit off the presidency, a claim that his acting chief of staff denied. Mick Mulvaney argued that Trump does not need the business boost because he is so successful in his own right. However, a Washington Post reporter who covers Trump\u2019s businesses noted that the president\u2019s resort has seen a severe drop in profits since he took office, so the multi-nation summit could provide a much-needed bump in revenue. Mulvaney also told reporters that the 2012 summit held at Camp David was so disastrous that it required a new site, such as Trump National Doral, but an organizer for the Camp David summit fiercely disputed that. Mark Zuckerberg defends Facebook and free speech Adding to an already eventful day, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg delivered a talk at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. on free speech and the dangers of government censorship. While Zuckerberg acknowledged that Facebook needs to work on reacting quickly to misinformation spreading on its platform, he said, \u201cI think we\u2019re in the right place on this.\u201d Facebook recently denied a request from former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign to remove a video, which it claims is false, that accused Biden of being corrupt over his handling of Ukraine. \u201cIn a democracy, I think people should be able to hear for themselves what politicians are saying,\u201d he said when defending his stance. Zuckerberg is scheduled to testify at a congressional hearing next week. Here\u2019s more from the Washington Post: Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said in an interview he worries \u201cabout an erosion of truth\u201d online but defended the policy that allows politicians to peddle ads containing misrepresentations and lies on his social network, a stance that has sparked an outcry during the 2020 presidential campaign. \u201cPeople worry, and I worry deeply, too, about an erosion of truth,\u201d Zuckerberg told The Washington Post ahead of a speech Thursday at Georgetown University. \u201cAt the same time, I don\u2019t think people want to live in a world where you can only say things that tech companies decide are 100 percent true. And I think that those tensions are something we have to live with.\u201d Republican senator Lindsey Graham, who has been fiercely critical of Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw US troops from northern Syria, said he appreciated efforts by the vice president and the secretary of state to negotiate a ceasefire in the region. But he interestingly did not refer to the agreement as a ceasefire, merely an attempt at one. The Turkish foreign minister has come out saying that the two countries only agreed to a \u201cpause\u201d in operations in the region. Graham told reporters on Capitol Hill that he still planned to introduce the bipartisan bill that would enact sanctions against Turkey, which he crafted with Democratic senator Chris Van Hollen. Trump has arrived in Texas to attend the ribbon-cutting of a Louis Vuitton workshop and speak at a campaign rally, and the president is praising the \u201camazing\u201d ceasefire in Syria just announced by the vice president. But again, a number of experts on the region are arguing that US officials made major concessions to the Turkish president in their negotiations. On top of that, this ceasefire (which a Turkish official said is actually just a \u201cpause\u201d) is meant to address violence that started after Turkey launched a military operation in the region, which was made possible by Trump\u2019s abrupt decision to withdraw US troops from northern Syria. The president is essentially declaring victory for making major concessions to an autocratic leader in a violent situation created by Trump\u2019s own foreign policy. Here\u2019s a copy of the US\u2019 official statement on the agreement reached with Turkey, handed out at today\u2019s press conference with vice president Mike Pence. The statement says that Turkish authorities will \u201cpause\u201d their operations in Syria to allow the withdrawal of the Kurdish YPG forces. The pause will last 120 hours and will be \u201chalted upon completion of this withdrawal\u201d. The agreement also says the US has agreed not to pursue \u201cfurther imposition of sanctions\u201d. Trump is taking a victory lap after his vice president, Mike Pence, announced that the US and Turkey had negotiated a ceasefire in Syria. However, Middle East experts are criticizing the deal, arguing that US officials acquiesced to the Turkish president\u2019s demands and essentially negotiated their Kurdish allies\u2019 surrender. From a senior resident at the Middle East Institute: Turkish foreign minister: Agreement is not a ceasefire Reports are coming out the Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu has said that the agreement is not a ceasefire but a pause in operations. The ceasefire will be 120 hours \u2013 five days. Pence seems confident that a permanent ceasefire will be in place. During the five days, Kurdish troops will withdraw from as Turkey creates a 20-mile \u201csafe zone\u201d. Pence says that the US endorsed a \u201csafe zone\u201d as a buffer between the Kurds and Turkish troops. Pence says he got assurances from both sides that \u201cthey will be moving out\u201d. Pence said because Turkey agreed to a ceasefire, the US agreed not to implement any sanctions. Once a permanent ceasefire is in place, economic sanctions will be removed. Vice-president Mike Pence just announced a ceasefire in Syria, negotiated with Turkey. Turkey has agreed to stop fighting to allow Kurdish forces to withdraw from Turkey\u2019s designated safe zone. Meanwhile, the press conference with vice president Mike Pence and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, is set to begin shortly. Trump indicated the two leaders had reached some kind of decision on the situation in Syria and predicted \u201cmillions of lives\u201d would be saved as a result. Well, that was a whirlwind of a press briefing from Mick Mulvaney. Here are some of the key points that Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff covered: The next G7 summit will be held at Trump\u2019s resort near Miami. Mulvaney said the White House correctly predicted the selection would spark allegations of the president trying to profit off his office, but officials decided to go ahead with the decision anyway because Trump National Doral was the \u201cperfect\u201d site for the multi-nation summit. Although the G7 will be held near Miami, which is already suffering the consequences of the higher temperatures and rising sea levels, Mulvaney said that the climate crisis would not be on the summit\u2019s agenda. Here\u2019s the real kicker: after weeks of Trump claiming there was no quid pro quo involved in the delaying of military aid to Ukraine, Mulvaney confirmed that there was indeed a quid pro quo. However, he said the quid pro quo in question involved an investigation of a debunked conspiracy theory from the 2016 election and not a probe of Joe Biden. Mulvaney said this distinction made the request acceptable, but it is safe to assume that any ethics expert would take issue with that argument. Mulvaney said it should be taken as a given that political calculations would factor into foreign policy decisions, and he offered this advice to reporters: \u201cGet over it.\u201d There will certainly be reactions to the presser rolling in, so stay tuned to the blog. Mulvaney has now concluded his press briefing, during which Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff dismissed any notion that it was inappropriate to allow political calculations to impact foreign policy. Mulvaney said: \u201cWe do it all the time. Get over it.\u201d Mulvaney is still speaking at the White House, but it\u2019s worth taking a moment to recognize what Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff just confirmed. Trump has insisted for weeks that there was no quid pro quo involved in the delaying of US military aid to Ukraine. However, Mulvaney is now essentially saying that there was a quid pro quo but that the quid pro quo in question involved an investigation of a conspiracy theory linked to the 2016 election, not a probe of Joe Biden. Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, said that the delay in distributing military aid to Ukraine was indeed connected to an investigation of the 2016 hacking of the Democratic National Committee. This is only the latest in a long series of shifting explanations from the White House for why the money was held up. But Mulvaney said there was nothing improper in the president\u2019s communications with Ukraine because the delayed aid was not at all connected to a potential investigation of Joe Biden. However, the White House\u2019s own memo on the president\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president shows that Trump brought up a potential investigation of Biden and his son, despite lacking any evidence to back up his corruption claims against the pair. The G7 summit will be hosted at one of Trump\u2019s resorts near Miami, which is already seeing the consequences of the climate crisis in higher temperatures and rising sea levels. But the president\u2019s acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, said the climate crisis would not be on the agenda for the multi-nation summit. Trump was criticized earlier this year for skipping a climate session at the G7 summit in France. Mulvaney brushed off a question from a reporter about how Trump could criticize Joe Biden for alleged self-dealing (with no evidence) when he is hosting a G7 summit at the president\u2019s resort. Criticism of hosting the G7 summit at Trump\u2019s Florida resort first surfaced earlier this year, when reports emerged that the property was being considered as a host site. Some noted that the club had previously settled a case with a guest who complained his room had beg bugs. Mulvaney defended the selection of Trump\u2019s resort as the site of the next G7 summit, saying the Doral club was the best option for hosting the multi-nation event. The acting White House chief of staff said: \u201cIt\u2019s almost like they built this facility to host that type of event.\u201d Mulvaney insisted that the president would not profit off the event and has not financially benefited from his office, echoing an oft-repeated claim from Trump himself. But Mulvaney acknowledged that he was initially \u201cskeptical\u201d of holding the summit at Trump National Doral because of the inevitable political fallout. Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, announced that the next G-7 summit would be held at one of Trump\u2019s clubs in Doral, Florida, in June. The announcement will certainly raise concerns that Trump is attempting to personally profit off the office of the presidency. The acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, has now taken the podium at the press briefing. The former congressman opened his comments by mourning the loss of representative Elijah Cummings, saying his former colleague was a \u201cclassy guy\u201d and would be missed. Vice president Mike Pence has now been meeting with the Turkish president for about four hours in Ankara, even though the pair\u2019s press conference was supposed to start more than an hour ago. Food is being brought in for the reporters gathered there, indicating that the meeting could go on for a while longer. Carolyn Maloney to chair House Oversight Committee In wake of US Congressman Elijah Cummings\u2019 death, US Representative Carolyn Maloney will take over as acting chair of the House Oversight Committee. Maloney, a Democrat from New York City, was the second most senior member on the committee. The committee plays a key role in the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry. Expressing her sadness over Cummings\u2019 passing, Maloney said in a statement that he was a \u201cdear friend and mentor. ... His legacy \u2013 his fight for fairness, justice and equality \u2013 should be an inspiration to us all.\u201d The White House announced that Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, will appear at a previously unannounced press briefing in about half an hour. The briefing will occur as Trump travels to Texas for a campaign rally and Pence continues his talks with the Turkish president in Ankara. Rick Perry says Trump directed him to Giuliani Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who was a top liaison between the Trump administration and Ukraine officials, says that Donald Trump directed him to his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to discuss Ukraine matters. Perry has been dodging questions about the impeachment inquiry and told the Journal he has no plans of leaving the administration. Here\u2019s more from the Wall Street Journal\u2019s story: Energy Secretary Rick Perry said he sought out Rudy Giuliani this spring at President Trump\u2019s direction to address Mr. Trump\u2019s concerns about alleged Ukrainian corruption, a sign of how closely the president\u2019s personal lawyer worked with the administration on Ukraine policy. Mr. Perry, in an exclusive interview with The Wall Street Journal, said he contacted Mr. Giuliani in an effort to ease a path to a meeting between Mr. Trump and his new Ukrainian counterpart. He said Mr. Giuliani described to him during their phone call several concerns about Ukraine\u2019s alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. election, concerns that haven\u2019t been substantiated. Nancy Pelosi has just concluded her weekly press conference, where the House speaker accused her Republican colleagues of distorting the meeting that senior lawmakers had with Trump yesterday. Pelosi said she sometimes wished that such meetings could be recorded because her recollection of these sit-downs is always so drastically different than that of her Republican colleagues. (Most journalists would probably embrace the idea of recording meetings between Trump and congressional leadership.) Asked about the widely shared photo of her standing and pointing a finger at Trump during the meeting, Pelosi initially said she believed she was excusing herself when the picture was taken. She then corrected herself, saying she believed that at that specific moment, she was saying, \u201cAll roads lead to Putin.\u201d The House speaker did not specifically weigh in on the president\u2019s alleged taunts and name-calling in the meeting, but she did criticize him and his team for lacking a plan on how to combat a potential resurgence of ISIS after the withdrawal of US troops from northern Syria. \u2018Steely yet compassionate, principled yet open to new perspectives\u2019 Former president Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama just released a statement on the death of US Congressman Elijah Cummings. \u201cTrue to the giants of progress he followed into public service, Chairman Cummings stood tallest and most resolute when our country needed him most,\u201d read the statement. Pelosi on Elijah Cummings: He lived the American dream Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi is in the middle of her weekly press conference. She started it off by remembering US Congressman Elijah Cummings. She announced that the House will name a bill lowering the cost of prescription drugs, a cause Cummings was passionate about, after the late Congressman in his honor. Meanwhile, lawmakers continue to offer condolences and memories in light of Democratic representative Elijah Cummings\u2019 unexpected death. The flag at the White House has been lowered to half-staff, and Nancy Pelosi is expected to soon address the loss in her weekly press conference. Press in Ankara were just briefly allowed in to the meeting between the vice president, Mike Pence, and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. A US official told the reporters that they could not shout questions at the leaders, due to demands from Erdogan\u2019s team. Earlier this morning, when Pence and Erdogan first met, the tension between the two leaders was palpable. Pence and the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, are in Turkey to discuss the situation in Syria, where violence against America\u2019s Kurdish allies has escalated since Turkish forces launched a military operation. Despite the violence and harsh criticism from his own party, Trump has stood by his decision to withdraw US troops from northern Syria. More from Sondland\u2019s testimony Back to Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union who\u2019s giving a closed-door testimony to Congress right now. In addition to telling the House committees that are overseeing the impeachment inquiry that he is \u201cdisappointed\u201d that Donald Trump directed his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to be involved in Ukraine affairs, Sondland will tell Congress that he did not understand Giuliani\u2019s agenda. \u201cI did not understand, until much later, that Mr. Giuliani\u2019s agenda might have also included an effort to prompt the Ukrainians to investigate Vice President Biden or his son or to involve Ukrainians, directly or indirectly, in the president\u2019s 2020 re-election campaign,\u201d he will say, per the New York Times. Joe Biden on Elijah Cummings: A true public servant Former vice president Joe Biden just released a statement on the death of US Congressman Elijah Cummings, joining the flood of memories and condolences that are coming in the late Congressman\u2019s honor. \u201cHis example showed us how to stand firmly for our rights and for what is right, how to never back down, without turning to personal disparagement and recrimination,\u201d Biden wrote. Here\u2019s a peek at Vice President Mike Pence meeting with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan \u2013 looks cheery! US ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland\u2019s opening statement to Congress has been leaked, just as his closed-door testimony to Congress is slated to start. Sondland, a wealthy hotel financier and a mega-Trump donor, is planning to break from Donald Trump in his testimony saying that Trump directed diplomats to work with Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer. \u201cWe were also disappointed by the president\u2019s direction that we involved Mr. Giuliani,\u201d Sondland is prepared to say. Sondland will say Giuliani told diplomats that a Ukrainian investigation into Burisma, the company that Hunter Biden has ties to, are \u201ctopics of importance for the president\u201d. Sondland\u2019s on the Hill Gordon Sondland, ambassador to the European Union, has just arrived at the capitol for his close-door testimony that begins at 10am. Sondland will be testifying before the House committees conducting the impeachment inquiry. Sondland \u2013 who had no diplomacy background before he took his post in June 2018 \u2013 is expected to tell Congress that he didn\u2019t know why US aid to Ukraine was held up nor does he know who ordered it. US Congressman Elijah Cummings was a staunch critic of Donald Trump and a key figure in Trump\u2019s impeachment inquiry as chairman of the House Oversight Committee. We\u2019ll just leave this to speak for itself: Capitol Hill mourns Elijah Cummings Other politicians, Democrats and Republicans, are expressing their sadness over the death of US Congressman Elijah Cummings. \u201cRest in Power\u201d is currently trending on Twitter due to the overflow of Tweets expressing sadness over Cumming\u2019s death. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi has just ordered flags at the US Capitol to be flown at half-mast in honor of Cummings. Donald Trump just tweeted out his condolences regarding the death of US Congressman Elijah Cummings. Good Thursday morning! Another busy day on Capitol Hill this morning. Gordon Sondland, US ambassador to the European Union and a key figure in the impeachment investigation, will be testifying this morning before the House committees leading the inquiry. Sondland allegedly pushed US diplomats to get onboard with pressuring Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy for an investigation into the company that Hunter Biden, Joe Biden\u2019s son, had ties to. Today, Sondland is expected to tell Congress that he was unaware that the company was linked to Hunter Biden. Sondland\u2019s testimony will start at 10am. Here\u2019s what else is happening in the world of politics today: The country is mourning the sudden death of US congressman Elijah Cummings. Besides being one of the most powerful Congressional members and part of leading the impeachment investigation of Donald Trump, Cummings was known for his devotion to Baltimore, his hometown and part of the district he represented, and civil rights. Many politicians have expressed their heartbreak over the news. Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo are in Turkey today to try, against the odds, to negotiate a cease-fire in Syria. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan allegedly threw away the letter that Trump sent him asking him for peace. The letter has been described by critics as \u201cadolescent\u201d in its language and tone. Trump is flying over to Texas today where he will be attending a ribbon cutting at a Louis Vuitton factory and hold a rally in Dallas later tonight.",

On 13 October, Kurdish leaders agreed to allow Syrian regime forces to enter some cities to protect them from being captured by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey\">Turkey</a>&nbsp;and its allies.

With US support, including arms and airstrikes, the Kurds managed to beat back Isis and went on to win a string of victories against the radical militant group. Along the way the fighters absorbed non-Kurdish groups, changed their name to the SDF and grew to include 60,000 soldiers.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why does Turkey oppose the Kurds?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>For years, Turkey has watched the growing ties between the US and SDF with alarm. Significant numbers of the Kurds in the SDF were also members of the People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG), an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK) that has fought an insurgency against the Turkish state for more than 35 years in which as many as 40,000 people have died. The PKK initially called for independence and now demands greater autonomy for Kurds inside&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey\">Turkey</a>.</p>\n    <p>Turkey claims the PKK has continued to wage war on the Turkish state, even as it has assisted in the fight against Isis. The PKK is listed as a terrorist group by Turkey, the US, the UK, Nato and others and this has proved awkward for the US and its allies, who have chosen to downplay the SDF\u2019s links to the PKK, preferring to focus on their shared objective of defeating Isis.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are Turkey\u2019s objectives on its southern border?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Turkey aims firstly to push the SDF away from its border, creating a 20-mile (32km) buffer zone that would have been jointly patrolled by Turkish and US troops until Trump\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/07/us-withdrawal-from-syria-leaves-fate-of-isis-fighters-and-families-in-detention-uncertain\">recent announcement</a>&nbsp;that American soldiers would withdraw from the region.</p>\n    <p>Erdo\u011fan has also said he would seek to relocate more than 1 million Syrian refugees in this \u201csafe zone\u201d, both removing them from his country (where their presence has started to create a backlash) and complicating the demographic mix in what he fears could become an autonomous Kurdish state on his border.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How would a Turkish incursion impact on Isis?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Nearly 11,000 Isis fighters, including almost 2,000 foreigners, and tens of thousands of their wives and children, are being held in detention camps and hastily fortified prisons across north-eastern Syria.</p>\n    <p>SDF leaders have warned they cannot guarantee the security of these prisoners if they are forced to redeploy their forces to the frontlines of a war against Turkey. They also fear Isis could use the chaos of war to mount attacks to free their fighters or reclaim territory.<br></p>\n    <p>On 11 October, it was reported that at least five detained Isis fighters had escaped a prison in the region. Two days later, 750 foreign women affiliated to Isis and their children managed to break out of a secure annex in the Ain Issa camp for displaced people, according to SDF officials.</p>\n    <p>It is unclear which detention sites the SDF still controls and the status of the prisoners inside.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michael-safi\"><b>Michael Safi</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>By invading, Erdogan had swept that mechanism aside, but in Ankara, Pence allowed the Turks to hijack the terms to refer to their area of occupation. Ankara said it would stretch 440 km from the Euphrates river to the Iraqi border, and 32km (20 miles) deep into Syria, up to the M4 highway which runs east-west across the region. The Turkish foreign minister said that across that whole area, Kurdish forces would have to hand over their heavy arms and withdraw.</p> \n<p>That is a fair description of Erdogan\u2019s maximalist war aims for his \u201cOperation Peace Spring\u201d. By explicitly accepting those terms, the US signalled acquiescence to the long-term Turkish aim of creating a buffer zone in north-eastern Syria, by removing much of the Kurdish population and resettling the area with Syrian Arab refugees.</p> \n<p>Colin Kahl, a former senior White House official in the Obama administration, who was extensively involved in dealing with the Kurds and Turkey, said he had assumed that the Turkish forces would aim to control just majority Arab areas in the north-east, but that this agreement suggested bigger ambitions.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf they really think they\u2019re going to push the Kurds all the way back to behind the M4 highway, that\u2019s, that\u2019s a huge population transfer,\u201d Kahl said. \u201cIt would involve massive ethnic cleansing essentially.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/10/syriaturkey-zip/giv-3902QHY2E9KA6WgO/\" data-alt=\"Turkey-Syria border map\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/10/syriaturkey-zip/giv-3902QHY2E9KA6WgO/\">Turkey-Syria border map</a> \n</figure> \n<p>In hailing the deal, Trump not only adopted Turkish talking points but even seemed to embrace the language of ethnic cleansing.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey\u2019ve had terrorists, they had a lot of people in there that they couldn\u2019t have.

He still plans to rid area of Kurds and create a \u2018security zone\u2019, but it\u2019s giving Kurds an ultimatum: they can leave voluntarily or leave dead.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Democratic senator Chris Murphy was even more blunt. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear: this essentially gives Erdo\u011fan everything he wants \u2013 it ratifies a Turkish takeover of a huge swath of the country and calls on the Kurds to abandon their territory or else the slaughter will continue,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a diplomatic victory \u2013 it\u2019s the capstone on Trump\u2019s abandonment of the Kurds.\u201d</p> \n<p>The choice of 120 hours for the length of ceasefire may not have been an accident. In five days Erdo\u011fan is due to fly to Moscow to meet Putin. That is where the real outline of a settlement will be hammered out, argued Jennifer Cafarella, researcher director at the Institute for the Study of War. \u201cSo basically the threat of US sanctions will help Russia get a deal,\u201d Cafarella wrote on Twitter. \u201cMazloum is likely betting that the negotiation between Russia and Turkey that will occur at the end of those five days will produce an outcome he can live with.\u201d</p>",

Trump\u2019s \u201cgreat day for civilisation\u201d may not last very much longer than a day or two at best. For its part the US Senate seemed particularly unconvinced. The Republican senator and usual Trump loyalist Marco Rubio said on Twitter that it \u201cdoesn\u2019t appear the \u2018ceasefire\u2019 signals change in Erdogan\u2019s goal. He still plans to rid area of Kurds and create a \u2018security zone\u2019, but it\u2019s giving Kurds an ultimatum: they can leave voluntarily or leave dead.\u201d The Democratic senator Chris Murphy was even more blunt. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear: this essentially gives Erdo\u011fan everything he wants \u2013 it ratifies a Turkish takeover of a huge swath of the country and calls on the Kurds to abandon their territory or else the slaughter will continue,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a diplomatic victory \u2013 it\u2019s the capstone on Trump\u2019s abandonment of the Kurds.\u201d The choice of 120 hours for the length of ceasefire may not have been an accident. In five days Erdo\u011fan is due to fly to Moscow to meet Putin. That is where the real outline of a settlement will be hammered out, argued Jennifer Cafarella, researcher director at the Institute for the Study of War. \u201cSo basically the threat of US sanctions will help Russia get a deal,\u201d Cafarella wrote on Twitter. \u201cMazloum is likely betting that the negotiation between Russia and Turkey that will occur at the end of those five days will produce an outcome he can live with.\u201d",
