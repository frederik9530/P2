A \u201cgood\u201d wildlife selfie was described as a picture where there is no contact between an animal and a human, and the animal is not being restrained or held in captivity to be a used as a photo prop. Celebrities have also contributed to the popularity of wildlife selfies, with Roger Federer and Margo Robbie posing with quokkas in Australia, Justin Beiber with a tiger, Kim Kardashian with an elephant and Taylor Swift with a kangaroo. In New Zealand, tourists have been caught dancing with endangered sea lions for selfies, chasing rare yellow-eyed penguins, and trying to hug the shy and reclusive Kiwi bird. Philippa Agnew, science and environmental manager at the Blue Penguin colony in Oamaru, on the east coast of New Zealand\u2019s South Island, says wildlife selfies have an \u201cindisputable\u201d impact on the penguins and all electronic recordings by tourists are banned. \u201cThe goal is to reduce all disturbance to the penguins.

      "bodyText": "At the height of the au pairs affair last year, a Senate inquiry into the matter heard that between assuming the immigration portfolio in December 2014 and the end of August last year, Peter Dutton had exercised his ministerial prerogative to grant somebody a visa to live in Australia 4,129 times: a rate of three a day. The ministerial power to grant visas is unchallengeable, it is extraordinarily broad and loosely defined. But its use is not novel. For all of the Machiavellian manoeuvrings of recent Australian political history, an immigration minister remains the most powerful person in the Australian government: vested with extraordinary, unchallengeable and secret powers to control the lives of people in, or seeking to come to, this country. The powers held by those responsible for the immigration portfolio dwarf those vested in the prime minister, the attorney general or foreign affairs minister. Previous immigration ministers \u2013 most notably Labor\u2019s Chris Evans, who ordered a review of the powers \u2013 have decried the burden and caprice of \u201cplaying God\u201d with the lives of people seeking to stay or come to Australia. But since then, in particular with debates around the \u201cresolving the asylum legacy caseload\u201d bill in 2014, and \u201cregional processing cohort\u201d bill this year, the trend has been consistent, and in one direction only: towards the consolidation of unchallengeable powers within the minister\u2019s person. (The creation of the Home Affairs super-department has created a hierarchy of several ministers who hold the power to administer the Migration Act: home affairs minister Peter Dutton, immigration minister David Coleman and assistant minister Jason Wood.) In the case of the Biloela Tamil family facing imminent deportation, the home affairs minister and other ministers in the department have the power to personally intervene in a visa decision if they believe it is in the \u201cpublic interest\u201d to do so. But public interest is not defined in the legislation, and can be deployed however a minister sees fit. For a democracy founded upon a series of checks and balances, the powers are extraordinary. The minister has sole discretion in deciding what is in the public interest and what is not: the minister cannot be compelled to intervene (there is no legal obligation on the minister to consider applications) and the power cannot be delegated to any other person: the decision must be made by the minister personally. The minister\u2019s decision cannot be appealed to any court or tribunal, for any reason. The power was created to be a safety valve for extraordinary and unforeseen circumstances, where following the letter of the law would lead to an unjust outcome. This is why the argument that family members in the Biloela case have not been found to be refugees is irrelevant. Ministerial intervention is designed precisely for situations where people are not found to be refugees. Otherwise there would be no reason for it, and no circumstance when it would be needed to be used. Ministerial guidelines offer some insight into when it might be used. The guidelines outline when cases may or may not be considered. Most relevantly for the Biloela family, these include \u201ccompassionate circumstances regarding your age and/or health and/or psychological state, that if not recognised would result in serious, ongoing and irreversible harm and continuing hardship\u201d. Generally, ministerial intervention is employed quietly and with the assistance of department officials who offer advice on whether or not the power should be used. In circumstances that also involved a boat arrival to Australia, in 2015, Dutton intervened in the case of a Rohingyan child from Myanmar who fled by boat after his parents were murdered in front of him. The child was being held on Nauru and was considered particularly vulnerable. His only surviving relatives were an elderly grandmother in Myanmar and two relatives in Australia. Nauru\u2019s justice minister, David Adeang, asked Dutton to allow the boy to resettle in Australia. Advice from his own home affairs department warned Dutton that doing so could be seen as a weakening of the offshore policy and might spark a resurgence in boats. However, the minister granted him a visa to live in Australia. The department told Dutton the \u201cexceptional [transfer] will likely be characterised by refugees in Nauru, and others as a direct contradiction [of] your strong messaging that refugees determined under regional processing arrangements will not be resettled in Australia\u201d. The department warned that allowing a Nauru-determined refugee to settle in Australia \u201cmay undermine this strong policy stance and create a loophole through which the policy can be circumvented\u201d through new illegal maritime arrivals to Australia. The boy was resettled with his relatives in Australia with no media or public attention. In the more well-ventilated au pairs case, Dutton also intervened on separate occasions to overrule his departmental officers who had cancelled the visas of women who sought to enter Australia, ostensibly as tourists, but whom the department believed intended to work as au pairs while in the country. A Senate inquiry into the au pairs affair found that while the minister is afforded broad powers not subject to judicial or merits review, there is no binding definition of \u201cpublic interest\u201d the minister must observe.",

They can see that we want a deal. </p> \n   <p>They can see that we have a clear vision for our future relationship with the EU - something that has perhaps not always been the case. </p> \n   <p>And they can see that we are utterly determined to strengthen our position by getting ready to come out regardless, come what may.</p> \n   <p>But if there is one thing that can hold us back in these talks it is the sense in Brussels that MPs may find some way to cancel the referendum.</p> \n   <p>Or that tomorrow MPs will vote \u2013 with Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 for yet another pointless delay. I don\u2019t think they will. I hope that they won\u2019t.</p> \n   <p>But if they do they will plainly chop the legs out from under the UK position and make any further negotiation absolutely impossible.</p> \n   <p>And so I say, to show our friends in Brussels that we are united in our purpose, MPs should vote with the government against Corbyn\u2019s pointless delay.</p> \n   <p>I want everybody to know \u2013 there are no circumstances in which I will ask Brussels to delay. We are leaving on 31 October, no ifs or buts. </p> \n   <p>We will not accept any attempt to go back on our promises or scrub that referendum.</p> \n   <p>Armed and fortified with that conviction I believe we will get a deal at that crucial summit in October </p> \n   <p>A deal that parliament will certainly be able to scrutinise.</p> \n   <p>And in the meantime let our negotiators get on with their work Without that sword of Damocles over their necks.</p> \n   <p>And without an election, which I don\u2019t want and you don\u2019t want.</p> \n   <p>Let us get on with the people\u2019s agenda \u2013 fighting crime, improving the NHS, boosting schools, cutting the cost of living, and unlocking talent and opportunity across the entire United Kingdom.</p> \n   <p>With infrastructure education and technology It is a massive agenda.

Asked if Johnson\u2019s plan worried her, Rudd replied said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It does and I have made my views clear to the prime minister that we should not be a party that is trying to remove from our party two former chancellors, a number of ex-cabinet ministers, that the way to hold our party together and to get a deal is to bring them onside and explain to them what we\u2019re trying to do and why.</p> \n   <p>I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair either to consider removing the whip from a group of people who oppose no deal, which is not the government position, but as a legitimate Conservative position, and not to remove the whip from people who have consistently voted against the withdrawal agreement and may yet vote against the agreement that Boris Johnson brings back before 31 October.

She explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Our mission here is to to prevent no deal. We do want a general election ... Our mission is very clear, and it is about preventing no deal. If that means that a general election cannot happen at that particular point, then stopping no deal must come first ... This isn\u2019t for the benefit of the Labour party. This is about preventing mass unemployment.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked if this meant Labour could vote against an early election, Chapman replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Theoretically.

Assuming that the bill passes, and assuming that it is robust enough to do what it is meant to do, in those circumstances the Labour objection to an election after 31 October might no longer apply.</p> \n  <p>Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, the easiest way to get around the rule saying the next election should not take place until 2022 (five years after the last one) would be for two-thirds of MPs to vote for an early election. Alternatively, the government could lose a vote of no confidence, and an election would take place if no alternative government won a confidence vote within 14 days.</p> \n  <p>Alternatively, the government could pass a new bill to amend the FTPA to allow an early election.</p> \n  <p>But, given that Boris Johnson only has a majority of one, and some Tories oppose a no-deal Brexit, he would not be able to use any of these mechanisms to call an early election without assistance from Labour.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73aae38e0e7b4352d887435f287db918ee68f9ea\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73aae38e0e7b4352d887435f287db918ee68f9ea/0_111_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jenny Chapman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jenny Chapman</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-02T13:22:43.913Z\">at 2.22pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d6d09388f081c5d7489e450\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-02T12:22:25.294Z\">1.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Sturgeon says SNP would back early election before 31 October</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon,</strong> Scotland\u2019s first minister, says the SNP would back an early election - provided it took place before 31 October.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NicolaSturgeon/status/1168492254866137088\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">As talk of a General Election mounts, I say \u2018bring it on\u2019...but it must be before Oct 31.

(See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/02/brexit-latest-news-boris-johnson-threatening-to-deselect-tory-rebels-to-provoke-early-election-claims-gauke-live-news?page=with:block-5d6cdfb38f08399d62f59700#block-5d6cdfb38f08399d62f59700\">10.51am</a>.) Corbyn said Labour wanted MPs to pass legislation designed to stop a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, and that he wanted a general election to follow. But he would not say what he would do if the legislation failed, or if Johnson tried to call a general election before the bill became law, or if Johnson proposed an election before 31 October. For an election to take place under the Fixed-Terms Parliaments Act, Labour would almost certainly have to vote in favour, or at least abstain. In the past No 10 sources have hinted that Johnson might try to trigger a general election to take place after the UK leaves the EU on 31 October \u2013 a proposal that Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, indicated yesterday Labour would find impossible to support. But Labour would find it much harder to oppose any election scheduled for before 31 October. </li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-02T11:19:08.909Z\">at 12.19pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d6cf1008f081c5d7489e355\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-02T10:44:44.585Z\">11.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>Q: What would you say to Labour leave supporters?</em><br></p> \n  <p>Corbyn says there were leave voters and remain voters at the weekend protests.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re going to close down this live blog now, here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s events: The prime minister will seek to hold a general election on 14 October if Parliament votes to hand control of the legislative timetable to the opposition on Tuesday, a government source said. Boris Johnson claimed Brussels would not engage until the possibility of legislation blocking a no-deal Brexit or a reversal of the whole process was removed and called for MPs to back him. He sought to ramp up the pressure on those Tory MPs minded not to do so as the Commons prepares to debate legislation designed to prevent a no-deal Brexit. MPs were left in no doubt that Tuesday\u2019s vote would be treated as a confidence vote by No 10 and the consequences for voting against Downing Street would be withdrawal of the whip. The work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, was one of those who urged Johnson not to go down that road. In an address outside Downing Street, Johnson indicated he would refuse to ask Brussels for a delay to Brexit, even if a law was passed requiring him to do so. Johnson said there were \u201cno circumstances in which I will ask Brussels to delay. We are leaving on 31 October - no ifs or buts\u201d. That was despite plans to vote tomorrow on whether or not to legally bind him to such a course of action, should he fail to convince Parliament to back either a withdrawal agreement or a no-deal Brexit. Ministers have previously refused to rule out the government ignoring the rule of law on the issue. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, insisted he would be ready for a general election. Earlier in the day, he had said he would back calling an early vote in any circumstances. However, Jenny Chapman \u2013 a shadow Brexit minister \u2013 later said Labour would not support a vote that took place after a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. The SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, committed her party to backing any vote before that date too. The former chancellor, Philip Hammond, challenged the prime minister to set out details of his plan to negotiate an alternative to the backstop. There have been reports that, despite Johnson claiming to have made progress, officials on the continent believe little or nothing has been achieved. The Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, also said British proposals were not satisfactory. If you\u2019d like to read yet more, my colleagues Peter Walker and Jessica Elgot have the full story: Update: A final piece of breaking news emerged shortly after I posted this summary. Hammond\u2019s local Conservative Association says it has reselected him as its candidate: The self-styled \u201cyellow-vest\u201d protester, James Goddard, has been arrested outside a Labour rally in Salford where Jeremy Corbyn spoke, amid clashes between the Labour leader\u2019s supporters and rightwing activists. My colleague, Lucinda Campbell, reports that Goddard was arrested and taken into custody after a car was obstructed leaving the venue in Salford\u2019s Media City. A Greater Manchester police spokesman said: Shortly before 8pm on Monday 2 September 2019, police arrested a 30-year-old man on suspicion of breach of the peace. The arrest was made following the conclusion of an event being held at the Lowry Theatre, Salford. The man remains in custody for questioning. About 1,400 people attended the event at the Lowry Lyric Theatre that featured speeches from Corbyn and the Labour frontbenchers John McDonnell, Diane Abbott, Rebecca Long-Bailey and Angela Rayner. Several protesters, both men and women dressed in black, bore British and English flags. One of the men said: \u201cWe voted to leave on 23 June, accept that you lost.\u201d The crowd chanted back, \u201cNazi scum off our streets\u201d, \u201cSay no to fascism\u201d and repeatedly sang in solidarity, \u201cOh, Jeremy Corbyn\u201d, applauding as police eventually arrested 30-year-old Goddard. He remains in custody on suspicion of breach of peace. Graham Brady, the former chair of the Tory backbench 1922 Committee, has claimed that Boris Johnson is \u201cvery keen\u201d to avoid a general election. Brady said the prime minister had given a \u201cvery good speech\u201d to his party colleagues in Downing Street before he addressed the nation outside. Speaking afterwards, Brady said Johnson had \u201cset a very clear course\u201d of things he wanted to achieve domestically, as well as trying to get a Brexit deal. He said he\u2019s very keen not to have an election. I think it\u2019s important we get on and make some progress with both the crucial issue of our exit from the European Union but there are many many other important things to do. He talked about the funding for schools, the new hospital refurbishments, many, many challenges we need to get on with. At around the same time as Johnson was addressing the nation, a senior government source was briefing journalists on the date the prime minister would seek to hold a general election, should MPs vote against him tomorrow. Opponents have accused Johnson of \u201cdoing everything he can to bring about an election, while claiming it\u2019s the last thing he wants\u201d. This evening, some MPs have been making clear their resolve remains strong (see: 8.19pm). BuzzFeed\u2019s Alex Wickham has a little more on the numbers expected to rebel: Not expected to vote against the government is the Brexit-supporting Labour MP, Kate Hoey: Meanwhile, the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, has said the focus should be on Brexit, rather than a potential general election. What we should be concentrating on is getting a deal to leave the European Union in an orderly fashion. But if we are in the realms of a general election, we will of course stand on our record of delivery through the confidence and supply [deal], the fact we have delivered a billion pounds here to the people of Northern Ireland and indeed are building on now, speaking to the Chancellor around the spending round which is coming on Wednesday, so we\u2019ll stand on a record of delivery, we\u2019ll stand on a record of standing four-square for the union. Political parties in Northern Ireland cannot be afraid of elections and we are not afraid of elections, but we don\u2019t believe it is the right time because what we should be concentrating on is getting a deal. A no-deal Brexit would mean \u201cdamage and danger\u201d to the peace process in Northern Ireland, Corbyn has said. He also spoke about the challenges of climate change and the impact of the government\u2019s austerity measures. Whenever this campaign begins, and you never know it might be almost upon us, we know what we\u2019ve got to do. We\u2019ve got to be united as a party and a movement, united in our determination to prevent a no-deal Brexit, for ensuring we come to an agreement in the future but deal with the injustice and the inequalities that exist in Britain and unite people around our programme which is one of delivering the houses, the jobs, the schools, the hospitals and above all that sense of hope in our community. With threats of withdrawal of the whip being made against those Tory MPs who refuse to back the government over a no-deal Brexit tomorrow, this will be an night of introspection for many. Their resolve appears to be holding, my colleague Jessica Elgot reports: Corbyn has accused Johnson of \u201cthreatening people with a no-deal Brexit if he doesn\u2019t get his way in parliament\u201d. I know people voted both ways in the referendum, obviously. I know people have different views about these things. obviously. But I simply say this: People didn\u2019t vote to lose their jobs, didn\u2019t vote to see our environmental standards, workers\u2019 rights, consumer protections ripped up. They voted because they were angry about many things and they voted as they did to try and protect themselves as best they could. Our purpose is to challenge this government on a no-deal Brexit, our purpose is to try to protect jobs and living standards, try to ensure that this country doesn\u2019t run headlong into the arms of Donald Trump and a trade deal with the United States. And he has added: The idea that Donald Trump and Boris Johnson are some kind of populist icons on behalf of the poorest and most downtrodden people actually is something beyond a misnomer. There is wealth funding these parties, there is wealth looking after itself and there is wealth that wants a no-deal Brexit, that the hedge funds might prosper as a result. We will challenge them in parliament tomorrow and we will continue that challenge. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has been addressing the party\u2019s rally in Salford this evening. He has told supporters: I don\u2019t know about you, but at 6pm I was watching on the television and waiting with great expectation. The expectation was possibly overrated, it was the BBC commentary awaiting the arrival of the speaker to a podium outside Downing Street and it was a bit like Test Match Special on a wet day when there is no cricket but nevertheless they talk and talk and talk. The statement itself didn\u2019t amount to very much, in fact it amounted to almost nothing at all except there was quite a powerful subliminal message there. As with the years of Theresa May, it\u2019s all about the Tory party. It\u2019s the Tory party talking to the Tory party about the Tory party and the Tory party\u2019s opportunities for the future. Well I simply say this: Tories can talk to each other about their party, they can talk to each other about their chances, or otherwise, of survival, and all the tax cuts they\u2019ll give to the rich and all the other things that they do. We, on the other hand, are out there with the people trying to bring about social justice and equality in our society. Adam Wagner, a human rights lawyer who writes for the Guardian, is among those to point out that many Jewish people would be unable to vote if a general election was called for 14 October: Speaking to the cabinet earlier, Boris Johnson said EU leaders had clarity on the UK\u2019s position but that he believed negotiations were being \u201cheld back\u201d because Brussels believed parliament would find a way to stop a no-deal scenario or cancel Brexit altogether. A senior government official said: The impression he was getting from EU leaders was that they will not engage until the prospect of parliament cancelling the referendum was ended. MPs are effectively considering tomorrow whether to hand control of the negotiations to Jeremy Corbyn. That would be shooting ourselves in the foot and, if Conservative MPs help him to make no deal illegal tomorrow and therefore create another pointless delay, the government\u2019s negotiating position will be wrecked. What they are effectively voting for is to hold a rapid election. And they will have to explain what they are doing. On Tuesday, if opposition MPs vote to take control of parliamentary business, Tory MPs have been told they will have the whip withdrawn because the government sees that as an effective confidence motion. Senior rebel Tories and Labour MPs are sceptical Johnson would stick to his word and call an election before 31 October, though government sources ruled out any chance of changing the date after MPs had voted. The source said: A PM would need to be in place before [the] European council [meeting] on 17 October. If you are to have any chance of securing a deal, you must have an election before then and the PM has been very clear he wants to get a deal. I know there has been speculation but that is not our mind, it is nowhere near our thinking. We can rule out the idea of any election taking place after the European council [meeting]. Downing Street is understood to be confident it can win a vote for a general election, though it is still unclear if it could achieve a two-thirds majority if a significant number of Tory and Labour MPs refuse to back the election with no guarantees that a no-deal Brexit can be avoided. A No 10 source said: Jeremy Corbyn has been very explicit he will back a general election no matter what. The PM would of course expect Conservative MPs to vote for it. The pro-remain Best for Britain campaign has attacked the prime minister after his address outside No 10 this evening. The Labour MP, David Lammy, who supports the campaign, has said: The prime minister has made this statement purely because his attempt to bully those Conservative MPs who have been standing up to him has failed. They\u2019ve chosen country over party. Tomorrow, MPs from across the House of Commons will get the ball rolling to stop a disastrous no-deal Brexit. There\u2019s no mandate for no-deal and Boris Johnson knows this. He will fail. Its chief executive, Naomi Smith, added: Boris Johnson said MPs trying to get an extension beyond 31 October were \u2018chopping the legs out from under the UK position\u2019. The brutal truth is that Johnson and his cabal of no-deal zealots are chopping the legs from underneath UK democracy. They must be stopped, no-deal must be stopped, Brexit must be stopped \u2013 in Johnson\u2019s own words, no ifs, no buts. Johnson\u2019s speech was being drowned out by protesters at the gates of Downing Street \u2013 let him be in no doubt that those voices are only going to get louder. The US will play a constructive role in a Brexit that \u201cencourages stability\u201d, its vice-president, Mike Pence, has said. Speaking at a joint press conference with Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, after touching down in the nation, he said: We will continue to work closely with our partners in Ireland and the United Kingdom to support a Brexit plan that encourages stability and also one which keeps the strong foundation forged by the Good Friday agreement. We understand these are complex issues. Pence confirmed he would be meeting Boris Johnson in the next few days and that \u201cbetter understanding\u201d the Northern Ireland issues would help promote a deal. I will be in the UK meeting with Prime Minister Boris Johnson in just a few days but I think the opportunity to better understand Ireland\u2019s perspective and unique needs, particularly with regard to the northern border, will make us even better equipped to hopefully play a constructive role that when Brexit occurs, it will occur in a way that reflects stability and addresses the unique relationship between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. He declined to answer a question over whether the US would commit to a trade deal with the UK if it damaged the peace process in Northern Ireland. In his address outside No 10 about an hour ago, Johnson called on MPs to vote with the government tomorrow, hinting that not doing so would make an election more likely. He said: We will not accept any attempt to go back on our promises or scrub that referendum. Armed and fortified with that conviction, I believe we will get a deal at that crucial summit in October; a deal that parliament will certainly be able to scrutinise. And, in the meantime, let our negotiators get on with their work without that sword of Damocles over their necks. And without an election, which I don\u2019t want and you don\u2019t want. The prime minister will ask MPs to back a general election for 14 October should a cross-party rebel alliance vote to take control of parliament tomorrow, according to a government source. Boris Johnson is set to treat a vote by opposition MPs to take control of the legislative agenda as an effective confidence vote. A government motion is set to be tabled by the government for a snap general election if rebels are successful in passing a motion to take control of the order paper. There would then be a vote on Wednesday on a new general election under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, which requires a two-thirds majority. The shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, has told the Labour rally: It\u2019s not about Brexit, it\u2019s about taking away the voices of our people. We know we are closer to power now than we ever have been and we have got the fight of our lives on our hands because every tool in Boris Johnson\u2019s box, he will pull out. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, added: We are here today at a pivotal political moment, a crucial moment in our political history as a country and it\u2019s not about Brexit, it is not about whether you voted to leave or remain, it\u2019s about what sort of country you want this to be. She described Johnson as a \u201crotten prime minister\u201d adding: \u201cThe sooner we get him out the better.\u201d About 1,400 people have gathered to listen to an address from Jeremy Corbyn and other senior Labour figures at the Lyric Theatre, in Salford Media City. My colleague, Lucinda Campbell, writes. The prime minister claimed he did not want one but speculation about a snap election persists. And, with Boris Johnson remaining adamant that the 31 October Brexit deadline will be honoured, Corbyn is expected to tell the crowd of Labour supporters that the party plans to stop a no-deal Brexit by continuing to push for a general election. Jonathan Marsland, 36, who works in local government in Manchester, favours legislative means of stopping no-deal: Labour\u2019s position has been incredibly nuanced from the start. We do need a general election, but only once legislation has been passed to stop no-deal. Marie O\u2019Neill, a 63-year-old community psychiatric nurse, said: We desperately need a change of government and a second referendum with remain on the ballot paper. Addressing the rally, the shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said she thought Johnson had \u201cbottled it\u201d. Referencing the prime minister\u2019s speech in Downing Street, she said: \u201cI think he looked pathetic.\u201d She told the crowd: I\u2019ve got a message for Boris Johnson: We don\u2019t believe you when you say you\u2019re going to give us the money for our schools and our police and our communities. The reason we don\u2019t believe you is because you were there implementing it for the last 10 years. Scotland\u2019s chief prosecutor is to intervene in two legal challenges against Boris Johnson suspending parliament, claiming prorogation is an abuse of power, it has been announced. The Scottish government said James Wolffe, the lord advocate, has lodged applications to join the legal actions in the court of session in Edinburgh and the Royal Courts of Justice, which aim to block prorogation. The Scottish case is due to be heard in full on Tuesday morning before Lord Doherty in the court of session. The case in London led by Gina Miller, whose legal action forced Theresa May\u2019s government to put the article 50 application to a vote at Westminster, is being heard on Thursday 5 September. Miller\u2019s case has already been joined by Sir John Major, the former Conservative prime minister, and Tom Watson, the deputy Labour leader, while the case in Edinburgh has been filed by Joanna Cherry QC, a Scottish National party MP, and 74 other MPs and peers, along with the Good Law Project. The Scottish government said Wolffe would argue that prorogation was intended to prevent scrutiny of the UK government\u2019s Brexit plans and was, therefore, an abuse of power. Mike Russell, the Scottish government\u2019s Brexit secretary, said: Accountable government is a fundamental principle of our democracy. This attempt to suspend the UK parliament at such a critical time is a clear attempt to silence opposition and must be resisted. The democratic wishes of the Scottish people and the Scottish parliament should not be allowed to be brushed aside as if they did not matter. Here is some more reaction to the Boris Johnson statement from journalists and commentators. From the BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil From Matthew Goodwin, an academic specialising in explaining populism From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg From BuzzFeed\u2019s Alex Wickham From the Economist\u2019s Anne McElvoy From the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth That\u2019s all from me for today. I\u2019m handing over now to my colleague Kevin Rawlinson. From Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon Here is the full text of Boris Johnson\u2019s statement. Five weeks ago I spoke to you from these steps and said that this government was not going to hang around and that we would not wait until Brexit day - October 31 - to deliver on the priorities of the British people. And so I am proud to say that on Wednesday Chancellor Sajid Javid is going to set out the most ambitious spending round for more than a decade. I said I wanted to make your streets safer \u2013 and that is why we are recruiting another 20,000 police officers. I said I wanted to improve your hospital and reduce the waiting times at your GP. And so we are doing 20 new hospital upgrades in addition to the extra \u00a334bn going into the NHS. And I said I wanted every child in this country to have a superb education and that\u2019s why I announced last week that we are levelling up funding across the country and spending much more next year in both primary and secondary schools. And it is to push forward this agenda on these and many other fronts that we need a Queen\u2019s speech in October. While leaving due time to debate Brexit and other matters. And as we come to that Brexit deadline I am encouraged by the progress we are making. In the last few weeks the chances of a deal have been rising, I believe, for three reasons. They can see that we want a deal. They can see that we have a clear vision for our future relationship with the EU - something that has perhaps not always been the case. And they can see that we are utterly determined to strengthen our position by getting ready to come out regardless, come what may. But if there is one thing that can hold us back in these talks it is the sense in Brussels that MPs may find some way to cancel the referendum. Or that tomorrow MPs will vote \u2013 with Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 for yet another pointless delay. I don\u2019t think they will. I hope that they won\u2019t. But if they do they will plainly chop the legs out from under the UK position and make any further negotiation absolutely impossible. And so I say, to show our friends in Brussels that we are united in our purpose, MPs should vote with the government against Corbyn\u2019s pointless delay. I want everybody to know \u2013 there are no circumstances in which I will ask Brussels to delay. We are leaving on 31 October, no ifs or buts. We will not accept any attempt to go back on our promises or scrub that referendum. Armed and fortified with that conviction I believe we will get a deal at that crucial summit in October A deal that parliament will certainly be able to scrutinise. And in the meantime let our negotiators get on with their work Without that sword of Damocles over their necks. And without an election, which I don\u2019t want and you don\u2019t want. Let us get on with the people\u2019s agenda \u2013 fighting crime, improving the NHS, boosting schools, cutting the cost of living, and unlocking talent and opportunity across the entire United Kingdom. With infrastructure education and technology It is a massive agenda. Let\u2019s come together and get it done \u2013 and let\u2019s get Brexit done by 31 October. Here is the key quote from Boris Johnson. MPs should vote with the government against Corbyn\u2019s pointless delay. I want everybody to know there are no circumstances in which I will ask Brussels to delay. We are leaving on 31 October - no ifs or buts. We will not accept any attempt to go back on our promises or scrub that referendum. This means Johnson is saying, if the Benn bill were passed, he would refuse to be bound by it. That implies he would opt of an election as an alternative - even though Johnson also insisted that he did not want one. Boris Johnson has now finished. He did not make an explicit threat to call an election on 14 October if defeated tomorrow, as ITV\u2019s Robert Peston predicted. (See 5.59pm.) But the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg is also being briefed with exactly the same message. And Johnson did say that under no circumstances would he delay Brexit - implying that, if MPs were to pass the Benn bill, he would default to an election. I will post a summary of Johnson\u2019s comments shortly. Boris Johnson says when he became PM he said he would not wait before making changes. That is why he has made a series of policy announcements, he says. It is to push forward these measures that he needs a Queen\u2019s speech. He says he has been encouraged by the progress being made towards a Brexit deal. He says there are three reasons why it has become more likely. The EU can see the UK wants a deal, he says. It can see the UK has a vision for Brexit. And it can see the UK is preparing for no-deal. He says MPs will chop the legs off his negotiating position if they vote tomorrow to rule out no-deal. He says there are no circumstances in which he will delay Brexit. Armed with this conviction, he believes he will get a deal at the EU summit in October, he says. He says negotiators should be allowed to get on with their work \u2013 without an election. I don\u2019t want an election and you don\u2019t want one either, he says. And that\u2019s it. The Sky News helicopter has footage of the party for Tory MPs in the Number 10 garden. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, has put out this statement about the Benn bill. This bill will stop Boris Johnson forcing through a reckless and damaging no-deal Brexit on 31 October. This week could be parliament\u2019s last chance to stop a no-deal Brexit. MPs must act in the national interest and support this bill. From my colleague Severin Carrell This is from ITV\u2019s Robert Peston. An election on 14 October would be on a Monday. Elections are normally held on Thursday, but there is no rule saying that has to be the case and there have been general elections on non-Thursdays in the past. The last one not on a Thursday was in 1931. Here is a summary of the main points from the bill designed to rule out a no-deal Brexit on 31 October - or the EU (withdrawal( No 6) bill, to give it its proper title. (See 5.29pm.) It sets two new deadlines. 19 October 2019 Under the bill, by this date the prime minister would have to either: Get MPs to pass a withdrawal agreement Get MPs to pass a motion agreeing to a no-deal Brexit Write to the EU requesting an extension to article 50 The text of the letter that would have to be sent to the president of the European council requesting an extension is set out in a schedule to the bill. It contains the second deadline. 31 January 2020 This would be the new date for the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU, if the extension proposed in the bill were granted by the EU. The bill says, if both sides agree a deal after 19 October but before 31 January, Brexit could happen sooner. But it does not say what would happen if there were still no agreement by the end of January. According to Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby, Boris Johnson won\u2019t be announcing a general election tonight in his statement at 6pm. Boris Johnson is going to make a statement outside Number 10 at 6pm, it has been announced. Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Commons Brexit committee, has just released the text of the bill that Tory rebels and opposition MPs want to use to rule out a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, has spoken out against Boris Johnson\u2019s plan to remove the whip from any Tory MP who votes against the government tomorrow on the no-deal Brexit issue and to thus effectively deselect them ahead of the next general election. In an interview with the Spectator\u2019s Katy Balls, Rudd said it would be unfair to punish remain-voting Tories like this when the same thing did not happen to MPs who repeatedly voted against Theresa May\u2019s deal. Asked if Johnson\u2019s plan worried her, Rudd replied said: It does and I have made my views clear to the prime minister that we should not be a party that is trying to remove from our party two former chancellors, a number of ex-cabinet ministers, that the way to hold our party together and to get a deal is to bring them onside and explain to them what we\u2019re trying to do and why. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair either to consider removing the whip from a group of people who oppose no deal, which is not the government position, but as a legitimate Conservative position, and not to remove the whip from people who have consistently voted against the withdrawal agreement and may yet vote against the agreement that Boris Johnson brings back before 31 October. So I\u2019m really urging the government to think very carefully about taking such a dramatic step. From ITV\u2019s Robert Peston Here is a question from below the line attracting some interest. As far as we know, the rebels plan to use standing order 24 tomorrow to trigger a debate on a motion that would allow them to take charge of the order paper to free up time to pass the bill intended to rule out a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. The Commons sits at 2.30pm tomorrow. But first there will be Foreign Office questions, and then we are expecting at least two statements, from Boris Johnson on the G7 and from Michael Gove on no-deal planning. The application for an SO24 debate would come after the statements, and then MPs would debate it the SO24 motion for up to three hours. According to Alex Wickham at BuzzFeed, the rebels and their opposition colleagues are divided as to whether to try to the pass the legislation on Tuesday night, or whether to do it on Tuesday or Wednesday. An SO24 debate has precedence over other business. And the motion that would be put to a vote at the end of the debate, the one allowing the rebels to take charge of the order paper, would prioritise the bill to rule out a no-deal Brexit. So the no-deal debate should happen before any debate on a general election. Rumours of a snap general election have sent the pound tumbling on the international currency markets, as investors brace for further political turmoil as the Brexit deadline edges closer. Sterling has slumped by almost a cent against the US dollar and sold-off sharply against the euro, sliding below $1.21 and \u20ac1.10 as election speculation spreads through the City. Analysts said the pound could drop further as the uncertainty unleashed by an election might further damage the economy or make no-deal Brexit increasingly likely, but said any surge in support for remain parties could cause sterling to rally. However, some analysts remained sceptical an election could make matters any clearer. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at the financial trading group IG, said: Anyone who thinks that an election will solve the UK\u2019s political crisis has not been paying attention over the past three years. Sterling is close to the lowest levels on record, having slumped whenever the chance of Britain leaving without a deal mounts. The pound is down by about 5% on the US dollar this year and is still worth about 19% less than on the eve of the EU referendum in 2016. These are from Sky\u2019s Sam Coates. The briefing paper as reported by Coates goes some way towards answering some of the questions posed by Philip Hammond. (See 3.53pm.) But Hammond will not be impressed by Coates\u2019 latest revelation about the \u201cdraft legal text\u201d. In a speech in Liverpool this morning Gordon Brown, the former Labour prime minister, said a no-deal Brexit would increase poverty. He explained: To stop a no-deal Brexit is important because poverty otherwise will get worse, food prices will go up, fuel prices will go up and therefore people\u2019s cost of living will be affected and, of course, people who are giving money to food banks will find it more difficult to do so because they themselves will be under pressure. We have got to stop a no-deal Brexit in its tracks. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, has been saying that Tory MPs need to show \u201ca little bit of discipline\u201d this week. On a school visit in Bromley, he said: I think that what people need to do is show a little bit of steel and a little bit of discipline. We all got elected as members of parliament as Conservatives to deliver on Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union. And we all stood on that same manifesto saying that we would do so. And we need to make sure that the prime minister has the very best hand when he goes to Europe, as he has been doing, to negotiate for a deal that will pass through parliament. And Theresa May\u2019s deal quite clearly would not pass through parliament. So we need to get something that means that it will do. In an interview on Sky News earlier, Williamson, a former chief whip and former defence secretary, also backed the threat to remove the Tory whip from any MP voting against the government to back legislation intended to rule out a no-deal Brexit. The SNP MP Stewart McDonald accused him of hypocrisy. Philip Hammond, the former chancellor and one of the leading Conservative rebels backing moves to rule out a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, has written to Boris Johnson challenging him to give details of what the government is doing to negotiate an alternative to the backstop with the EU. Hammond says he and his colleagues had been hoping to discuss these points with Johnson today before their meeting with him was cancelled. The letter, and the six questions it contains, are prompted by fears that any progress towards a deal with the EU is minimal, or non-existent. Johnson has repeatedly talked up the progress he claims to have made in his recent visits to Berlin and to Paris, and at the G7 summit in Biarritz. But according to a report in the Sunday Times (paywall) yesterday, based on \u201ca note of diplomatic briefings by French officials, circulating in London,\u201d the French do not believe Johnson is getting closer to a deal. In his story Tim Shipman says: Contrary to claims by Downing Street that Johnson has made progress at the EU level, the note says that his Brexit negotiator has so far presented \u201cnothing\u201d to Brussels and \u201cnothing of note\u201d has occurred so far in the discussions. In an interview with the Sunday Times (paywall) yesterday Boris Johnson refused to rule out creating hundreds of new pro-Brexit peers to stop the Lords legislating to stop a no-deal Brexit. Norman Fowler, the Lord Speaker of the Lords, says \u201cnothing could be worse\u201d. Fowler takes a particular interest in this because he chaired a committee that came up with ideas, which are slowly being implemented, intended to reduce the size of the Lords. In reality Johnson\u2019s threat was an empty one. In theory the government could ask the Queen to create hundreds of new peers, but the House of Lords only normally allows two new peers at most to be introduced every day and the government does not have a majority in the Lords to change its procedures. If Johnson were to create 100 new pro-Brexit peers, it would take until Christmas before they could all take their seats. The latest fear amongst anti-Brexit MPs is that Boris Johnson could announce a general election for before 31 October, but then shift the date to after, ITV\u2019s Paul Brand reports. The Scottish parliament\u2019s information centre has published a 57-page briefing (pdf) on a no-deal Brexit today. \u201cPotential border checks present the most likely immediate form of disruption following a no-deal Brexit which might result in long queues at the UK-EU borders as goods travel through customs and are subject to standards checks,\u201d it says. Owen Smith, who unsuccessfully challenged Jeremy Corbyn for the Labour leadership in 2016, says Labour should not be backing an early election. If you want a friend in politics, get a dog, Harry Truman is reputed to have said. With his majority set to disappear this week, Boris Johnson has taken up Truman\u2019s suggestion. (See 2.27pm.) According to Johnson\u2019s partner Carrie Symonds, their new Jack Russell is called Dilyn. Jacob Rees-Mogg has accused a doctor of \u201cfear-mongering\u201d after he challenged the Commons Leader to say how many people he would accept could die as a result of a no-deal Brexit. As the Press Association reports, Dr David Nicholl, a consultant neurologist involved in the Operation Yellowhammer report into the impact of a no-deal Brexit on the NHS, called in to LBC\u2019s Ring Rees-Mogg show to ask what \u201cmortality rate\u201d he would accept if the UK crashed out of the EU without a deal. Nicholl asked: Having been involved in writing the plans for mitigation and having whistle-blown because I felt they were unsafe, what level of mortality rate are you willing to accept in the light of a no-deal Brexit? Rees-Mogg replied: I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any reason to suppose that a no-deal Brexit should lead to a mortality rate. I think this is the worst excess of Project Fear and I\u2019m surprised that a doctor in your position would be fear-mongering in this way on public radio. As PA reports, Nicholl told the prominent Brexiter: Can I remind you I wrote the plans of mitigation? But Rees-Mogg replied: Well you didn\u2019t write very good plans if you hadn\u2019t worked out how to mitigate, had you? It\u2019s fortunate they are being written by other people now who are serious about mitigating, rather than remoaners. Nicholl said people could die because of potential problems with access to drugs and radioactive isotopes in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Rees-Mogg said there were \u201creserve plans to fly drugs in if necessary\u201d. He said: This is a major focus of government policy. I think it\u2019s deeply irresponsible, Dr Nicholl, of you to call in and try to spread fear across the country. I think it\u2019s typical of remainer campaigners and you should be quite ashamed, I\u2019m afraid. UPDATE: Originally, based on the PA report, I said the caller was David Nicol, a consultant urologist. But in fact he was David Nicholl, a consultant neurologist. I\u2019ve corrected that now. Downing Street has a new dog after Boris Johnson and his girlfriend, Carrie Symonds, took delivery of a rescue puppy, the Press Association reports. The Jack Russell \u2013 which has yet to be named \u2013 was carried into Number 10 to meet its new owners this morning. The rescue dog came from the Friends of Animals Wales charity, which said the \u201cgorgeous pup will be living his best life with Carrie and the prime minister at their Downing Street home\u201d. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman said: They are a fantastic charity run by volunteers who work around the clock to make a difference to animals. The prime minister has always been a passionate supporter of animal welfare and has always believed that animals should always get the right start in life. That\u2019s why the government has taken such significant action in this area, and that obviously includes introducing Lucy\u2019s Law. Earlier today Jeremy Corbyn suggested that Labour would back an early election any circumstances (see 12.04pm and 12.06pm) - even though Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, told the Andrew Marr Show yesterday that the party had been thinking \u201clong and hard\u201d about the risk of Boris Johnson calling a general election for after a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. On the World at One Jenny Chapman, a shadow Brexit minister (ie, a member of Starmer\u2019s team), said that if a general election were scheduled to take place after a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, Labour would not support it. She explained: Our mission here is to to prevent no deal. We do want a general election ... Our mission is very clear, and it is about preventing no deal. If that means that a general election cannot happen at that particular point, then stopping no deal must come first ... This isn\u2019t for the benefit of the Labour party. This is about preventing mass unemployment. Asked if this meant Labour could vote against an early election, Chapman replied: Theoretically. But more likely having a general election becomes one of the few ways that we are able to prevent no deal. Labour says it is confident there is a majority for the planned bill designed to rule out a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. Assuming that the bill passes, and assuming that it is robust enough to do what it is meant to do, in those circumstances the Labour objection to an election after 31 October might no longer apply. Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, the easiest way to get around the rule saying the next election should not take place until 2022 (five years after the last one) would be for two-thirds of MPs to vote for an early election. Alternatively, the government could lose a vote of no confidence, and an election would take place if no alternative government won a confidence vote within 14 days. Alternatively, the government could pass a new bill to amend the FTPA to allow an early election. But, given that Boris Johnson only has a majority of one, and some Tories oppose a no-deal Brexit, he would not be able to use any of these mechanisms to call an early election without assistance from Labour. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, says the SNP would back an early election - provided it took place before 31 October. Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach (prime minister), has said that he expects to have a meeting with Boris Johnson next week. He told RTE that he was always willing to listen to any proposal from the British PM, but that he had yet to hear of a convincing alternative to the backstop. He explained: The backstop is a means to an end. It is there to ensure that we continue to have frictionless trade north and south, that there is no physical infrastructure, no checks, no controls, no tariffs. We want that to continue to be the case. It has been the case since 1992, we want that to continue. Of course, I would listen to any proposals that the British prime minister may have to achieve that by an alternative means and we provide for alternative arrangements in the joint political declaration. The difficulty is that anything we have seen so far when it comes to alternative arrangements do something very different. They just manage a border, they facilitate tariffs, they facilitate checks, they facilitate controls but try to do it in a way that is invisible and unobtrusive, and that is better than nothing but it is not the outcome that we want to achieve. Jean-Claude Piris, a former head of the European council\u2019s legal service whose views are generally an accurate reflection of Brussels\u2019 thinking, said last week that Britain was heading for \u201ca really deep political and probably a deep constitutional crisis\u201d. Following Michael Gove\u2019s refusal this weekend to rule out ignoring any law passed by parliament to stop no deal, Piris has now warned that the \u201cdivisive effect\u201d of Brexit means democracy and the rule of law in Britain are slipping. The Guardian\u2019s Jennifer Rankin reckons Boris Johnson\u2019s controversial decision to prorogue parliament will make it harder for the EU27 to agree a Brexit deal, partly because they do not want to be seen to be rewarding that kind of behaviour. This is from a Number 10 source, The PM is hosting all Tory MPs at Number 10 this evening. He is taking the opportunity to see cabinet as well \u2013 the cabinet calling notice should have gone out \u2013 and they will discuss the government\u2019s response to MPs seeking to take control of the legislative agenda away from the government and handing it to the opposition and Corbyn without the consent of the people. The view is that tomorrow\u2019s possible vote is an expression of confidence in the government\u2019s negotiating position to secure a deal and will be treated as such. These are from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg. The vice-president of the European parliament has said she thinks it is unlikely that there will be a new Brexit deal at the next European council summit on 17 October. Mairead McGuinness said the EU would not succumb to threats from the UK and that Boris Johnson\u2019s approach \u201cto take back control in a more boisterous way\u201d than Theresa May was not the way to \u201cyield results\u201d. In an interview with RTE Radio\u2019s Sean O\u2019Rourke programme the Irish MEP confirmed talks were intensifying in Brussels, but she said they should not mischaracterised as renegotiation of the withdrawal agreement. Under the process, Michel Barnier would need to get a new mandate from 27 EU leaders, and in the present febrile atmosphere there was no prospect of change, she told RTE. She said: I don\u2019t see why [the EU would compromise] because, if you look at what that would involve, it would be mean that the democratically elected leaders of Europe would yield to a very unhelpful pressure that the British prime minister is heaping upon them, almost threatening that: \u2018Look, we are going either way and you are going to have to deal with us.\u2019 McGuinness said she believed Johnson\u2019s preferred option was no deal. Boris Johnson has called a unexpected meeting of the cabinet today at 5pm, multiple Whitehall sources have confirmed. The prime minister is then expected to address Conservative MPs at a summer garden party in Downing Street. The scheduling of the meeting has sent the rumour mill in Westminster into overdrive about the possibility that the government will set out plans for an snap general election this week. Though no plans have been confirmed, senior rebel sources believe that Johnson could move as early as Wednesday this week, with a motion tabled the following day which would require the support of two-thirds of MPs. A vote on the snap poll would come with a commitment that polling day would be before October 31 - though the date would ultimately be in the control of the government. A Scottish court has refused leave to appeal against a judge\u2019s decision last week to reject an application for an emergency ban on Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament last week. On Friday Lord Doherty, sitting in the court of session in Edinburgh, refused a request by lawyers for 75 anti-Brexit MPs and peers for an interim suspension and interim interdict, or injunction, of the prime minister\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament. In a compromise move, Doherty instead brought forward a full hearing on the main legal case against prorogation from Friday this week to tomorrow. Joanna Cherry, the Scottish National party MP leading the group drawn from most of Westminster\u2019s opposition parties and coordinated by the Good Law Project, said on Friday that was a victory. Despite that, the group\u2019s legal team applied earlier this morning for leave to appeal Doherty\u2019s refusal to grant that emergency ban. Cherry\u2019s lawyers wanted to greatly speed up the appeal process because they expect Doherty will support the UK government\u2019s case that Johnson\u2019s move is legal tomorrow, which will require an urgent appeal at the court of session on Thursday. They worry they could lose time to get the case heard by the supreme court before next Monday, when prorogation could take effect. The Scottish judiciary tweeted that their application had been denied, and the case will go to a full hearing tomorrow as scheduled. Labour sources are playing down the prospect of Jeremy Corbyn backing an early general election without the legislation blocking a no-deal Brexit on the statute book, saying they are \u201cconvinced\u201d that there is a majority for this bill. From Sky\u2019s Sam Coates Labour sources are not contesting the Sky report saying Jeremy Corbyn would back an early election in all circumstances (see 12.06pm) - which would include MPs failing to pass the bill ruling out a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, and which could also include a general election scheduled for after 31 October. \u201cWe are the opposition and we always want a general election,\u201d a source said. Here is the full text of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s speech. And this is what he said about the sequencing of the anti no-deal Brexit legislation and then a general election. So, first we must come together to stop no deal. This week could be our last chance. We are working with other parties to do everything necessary to pull our country back from the brink. Then we need a general election. When a government finds itself without a majority the solution is not to undermine democracy. The solution is to let the people decide, and call a general election. This implies that the no-deal legislation would have to be passed before Labour could support an early election. But, when pressed on this point at his Q&amp;A (see 12.04pm) and after (see 12.06pm), Corbyn did not rule out backing an early general election with no deal still on the table. This is from Sky\u2019s Kate McCann, who was listening to the Jeremy Corbyn speech in Salford. We may or may not get some clarification from Corbyn\u2019s office later as to whether or not this is the party\u2019s official position. In the past, officials have sometimes had to \u201cclarify\u201d remarks that Corbyn has made unscripted to journalists. Corbyn has now finished his Q&amp;A. Here is the main line. Corbyn rejected Tony Blair\u2019s call for Labour to avoid backing an early general election in favour of pushing for a referendum instead. In a speech this morning Blair said an early election could favour Boris Johnson, because of Corbyn\u2019s unpopularity. (See 10.51am.) Corbyn said Labour wanted MPs to pass legislation designed to stop a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, and that he wanted a general election to follow. But he would not say what he would do if the legislation failed, or if Johnson tried to call a general election before the bill became law, or if Johnson proposed an election before 31 October. For an election to take place under the Fixed-Terms Parliaments Act, Labour would almost certainly have to vote in favour, or at least abstain. In the past No 10 sources have hinted that Johnson might try to trigger a general election to take place after the UK leaves the EU on 31 October \u2013 a proposal that Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, indicated yesterday Labour would find impossible to support. But Labour would find it much harder to oppose any election scheduled for before 31 October. Q: What would you say to Labour leave supporters? Corbyn says there were leave voters and remain voters at the weekend protests. People are alarmed at the prospect of a no-deal Brexit. He says there were many reasons for people voting leave. But no one voted leave to lose their jobs, or to secure a sweetheart deal favouring the US. So he will fight the next election on his transformative agenda, he says. He says if the PM continues with his dictatorial approach, Labour will oppose him all the way. If the PM has lost the support of parliament, it is time for that government to go. Q: Will Labour back Tory rebels if they propose legislation to prevent no deal? Corbyn says he has met the leaders of other opposition parties, apart from the Democratic Unionist party. He will work with them to stop a no-deal Brexit. He wrote to all MPs opposed to no deal asking them to back him. He says in another \u201c28 hours or so\u201d we will see what Labour is backing (ie, the text of the rebel bill). Q: Would you back a general election if it meant the UK might leave the EU without a deal on 31 October? Corbyn, who took all three questions in one go (as he usually does at press conferences), did not specifically address this question when he answered. Corbyn is now taking questions. Q: If there were a second referendum, would Labour back a Labour leave option? Q: Tony Blair says you should block a general election. But it sounds like you want one. Would you back one at any time? Corbyn says he will do everything possible to stop a no-deal Brexit. A vote of no confidence is still on the table. It is not an either/or, he says. He says he wants a general election. Labour would propose a referendum, with remain one option, and another decided by parliament. Corbyn says MPs must come together to stop a no-deal Brexit. He says Labour is working with other parties to achieve that. After that, there must be a general election, he says. He says a general election is the democratic way forward. Corbyn says he wants general election after legislation blocking no-deal gets passed. Corbyn says Labour will end austerity and invest in all regions of the country. Corbyn says when services like a library, or a Sure Start centre, close, that \u201csaps the spirit from the area\u201d. Councillors go through horrors trying to work out how they can protect services, given the extent of government cuts, he says. Corbyn says Labour will have a green industrial revolution, by retrofitting houses, thereby creating jobs and saving energy at the same time. Corbyn says the north needs a full Crossrail service. It should no longer be held back by poor transport infrastructure, he says. Corbyn says Labour has a serious plan to get the economy working in every region of the country. It includes a \u00a3250bn national transformation fund that will be based outside London, he says. He says Boris Johnson has announced a \u00a33.6bn towns fund. Labour\u2019s national transformation fund is 70 times bigger, he says. He also says Labour will use regional banks to devolve economic power. He says for years politicians have argued that the economy is beyond economic control. That is an idea that favours the super-rich. But it is not true. Through democracy, you can change in whose interests the economy works, he says. He says Labour will extend workplace democracy. Corbyn is listing various sectors of the economy that would be hammered by a no-deal Brexit. He says the Tories favour those who lend and speculate over those who make things. That is why hedge fund managers are \u201ccalling the shots\u201d under Boris Johnson. Corbyn says, with the lenders and speculators in charge, wealth and opportunity are not shared. We have the worst regional inequality in Europe, he says. Corbyn says the food industry says a no-deal Brexit will lead to food shortages. The government denies this, he says. But who do you trust? he asks. Those who work in the industry? Or Boris Johnson, who has never worked in the industry. Corbyn says a no-deal Brexit would be a Trump-deal Brexit. A no-deal Brexit is really a Trump-deal Brexit, leading to a one-sided US trade deal that will put us at the mercy of Donald Trump and the big American corporations. The pally enthusiasm of the US president for Britain\u2019s new prime minister only underlines that in Boris Johnson Trump has found a compliant British leader who will dance to his tune. Corbyn says he is not willing to accept this. Corbyn says the demonstrations at the weekend showed people will not accept Boris Johnson trying to close down parliament. He says the government is being run by a \u201cphoney populist cabal\u201d. Labour would never ignore parliament in this manner, he says. Jeremy Corbyn is speaking now. He starts by praising Rebecca Long-Bailey as a \u201cbrilliant\u201d MP. (It is widely assumed she is the Corbynites\u2019 favoured candidate for next Labour leader.) Corbyn says the shadow cabinet will today be finalising its plans for avoiding a no-deal Brexit. He says where he is speaking is not far from the site of the Peterloo massacre. We should never forget that people died in the struggle for democracy, he says. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary and MP for Salford and Eccles, is now introducing Jeremy Corbyn at the Labour event. The Jeremy Corbyn speech is due to start soon. There is a live feed at the top of this blog. Corbyn is in Salford, where is he also chairing a shadow cabinet meeting. The self-described alternative arrangements commission, chaired by former ministers Greg Hands and Suella Braverman, has increased its campaign to get its July report on potential solutions for the Irish border accepted by the EU, London and Dublin. \u201cEverybody needs to remember that a vote for a Brexit deal did actually pass in parliament earlier this year. The Brady amendment, calling for alternative arrangements to the Irish backstop, had a majority of 16,\u201d the commission said in a statement announcing updates to its report. It went on: The reality is that the clock is now ticking rapidly towards a no-deal on October 31st. We ask that all sides, including the British government, the EU and the Irish government, come together and use our tools to agree a new withdrawal agreement. Braverman, a Brexiter, briefed the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, and his principle adviser Stephanie Riso on Friday. In its new report, the commission proposes a series of changes to the political declaration that accompanied the withdrawal agreement including a \u201cclear commitment\u201d that \u201cprovisions relating to building on the backstop and the single customs territory are removed\u201d. It also states that the government\u2019s aim is no longer \u201cfrictionless trade\u201d with the EU but \u201cas frictionless as possible trade\u201d and that the political declaration needs to clearly state that a free trade agreement is the ultimate \u201cend destination\u201d. Other new proposals for the declaration include a commitment to ensure the EU \u201cdoes not introduce hostile new rules\u201d in any transition period. And it wants changes to ensure the UK\u2019s sovereign defence and security, including the \u201cfive eyes\u201d intelligence alliance, is protected. Here are the key points from Tony Blair\u2019s speech. I cannot find a text of it online yet, but it will probably appear on his foundation\u2019s website at some point. Blair said Boris Johnson wanted an early election because it would be a \u201ctrap\u201d for Labour. Rather than voting for an early election, MPs should insist on a referendum, he said: If parliament cannot agree, then the right way to consult the people is not through a general election but through a referendum. That means, as MPs from different parties have agreed, that there should not be a motion of no confidence but rather legislation preventing no deal. Should the government seek an election, it should be refused in favour of a referendum. It is counterintuitive for opposition parties to refuse an election. But in this exceptional case, it is vital they do so as a matter of principle, until Brexit is resolved. Brexit is an issue which stands on its own, was originally decided on its own and should be reconsidered on its own. The Brexiteers are laying a trap, to seem as if pushed into an election, whilst actively preparing for one. Blair said Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s unpopularity would make an election more appealing to Johnson. [The Brexiters] know there are two issues in British politics not one: Brexit; and the Corbyn leadership. It is the interplay between these two issues that has shaped and defined British politics over the past 3-4 years. Boris Johnson knows that if no-deal Brexit stands on its own as a proposition, it might well fail. But if he mixes up the Brexit question with the Corbyn question in a general election, he could succeed, despite a majority being against a no-deal Brexit, because some may fear a Corbyn premiership more. Blair acknowledged that the prospect of a no-deal Brexit as an alternative might also make some people more likely than otherwise to vote for Corbyn. But he said that Corbyn should recognise an election as \u201cthe elephant trap it is\u201d and he said Corbyn had acted \u201cresponsibly\u201d in making legislation to rule out no deal a priority this week, not a confidence vote. He went on: Leave aside what is fair or unfair: no opposition leader or party with these poll ratings has won an election. The 2017 result has inoculated the Labour party against a realistic assessment of where it stands. To be sure, an election is a risk for the Tories. Each Tory candidate will have to sign up to no deal. The Brexit party is a one man unpredictable band. Scotland will be very tough. But my bet is the Brexit party will collapse to them. The Labour party at present will struggle; a resurgent Lib Dems will do well, but not well enough to govern. The opposition vote will split. Under our system that delivers a comfortable Tory majority. Blair suggested he was surprised that Johnson did not realise people would question the legitimacy of a no-deal Brexit. Does no one presently in government, particularly those cabinet members who used to protest against the irresponsibility of such a course, understand the consequence of doing this in circumstances where a large part of the country will regard it as illegitimate? Democracy depends on a shared sense of legitimacy in decision making. Legitimacy is not the same as agreement with government. Governments do things people dislike. But outside of the political fringes, most people accept their right to do them. This is now a crisis of legitimacy. No one in government even pretends to address these anxieties. He said Brexit was difficult to resolve because there were at least three different versions of it. Not once have our nation\u2019s leadership explained to the public why Brexit has been so difficult to resolve, which is because there are at least three different versions of it \u2013 hard, soft and no-deal and all are vastly different in their implications. He said the Brexit debate was so bitter because it was about values and identity, and not just about the EU. Brexit has become so bitter because Brexit is not simply about a decision to leave the EU. It is about culture, identity, values, generation. The essence is not about trade. It is about who we are as a nation in the 21st century. Normally questions of identity play out over time, by evolution, or by staggered points of development in successive elections. But the holding of the referendum turned this into a moment of revolution. It forced us to confront a division, perhaps better unconfronted. On the one side are those who feel Britain as they know it is being cast aside, the things they like about Britain disappearing, and in their place, petty political correctness, bureaucratic obsessions, magnified and exemplified by Europe, and, above all, obedience to the god of multi-culturalism at the expense of \u2018our own culture\u2019 ... Those of us on the other side ... we look at Europe today and see 70 years of peace and relative stability. He suggested the second world war was casting \u201ca long shadow over the British psyche\u201d which was not helpful: [Pro-Brexit] Britain imagines a parallel with the second world war, a period of our history which, rightly, makes us proud. Read the speeches of the Brexiteers and they are replete with references to this feat of glory. But it casts a long shadow over the British psyche. It creates a longing to live the moment again, to see each new circumstance through the lens of its narrative, a life and death struggle between us and those who would harm us, where against all odds we triumph, a series of Darkest Hours from which we emerge to the sunlit uplands. It is not just Tory MPs planning to support the legislation intended to rule out a no-deal Brexit on 31 October who are criticising Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to threaten rebels with the withdrawal of the whip. This is what Charles Walker, a Brexiter Tory and acting co-chair of the Conservative 1922 Committee, told the Daily Telegraph about Johnson\u2019s strategy. Walker said: I say, as a committed Brexiteer and acting co-chair of the 1922, that talk of purging good Conservatives, who were serving in government up until late July, from our ranks is extremely unpleasant and the idea is one that must be resisted. On the Today programme this morning Nick Boles, the former Conservative MP who now sits as an independent having left the party over its hard Brexit policies, said he thought his old party was dead because the \u201chard right\u201d had taken over. Asked if the Tory party was finished, he said: Yes. The hard right has taken over the Conservative party. The Conservative party has fallen prey to an almost religious obsession with the hardest form of Brexit. Boles also said that there were \u201csome people in the Conservative party who are willing to sell their principles at a pretty low price in exchange for a job in the cabinet despite what they\u2019ve said previously about a no-deal Brexit.\u201d Tony Blair is now taking questions. There is a live feed of the event here. One of the arguments Boris Johnson makes for leaving the EU by 31 October at the latest is that voters are fed up with the Brexit crisis. They just want the whole thing over, he argues, so that the government can focus on other issues, such as health and crime. It is an argument that probably resonates with many people. In his speech on Brexit this morning Tony Blair, the former Labour prime minister, said this was not a good reason for pressing ahead. He said: It has suited [the Brexiters] to ride a wave of \u2018just do it\u2019 emotion, born of public impatience. You\u2019re bored of Brexit. I\u2019m bored of Brexit. We all are. But no serious political leader would suggest that we should take a decision of this magnitude by an effluxion of patience. HuffPost has a preview of the Blair speech here. I\u2019ll post a full summary when I\u2019ve seen the text, but the BBC\u2019s Chris Mason has some excerpts. Here is a Press Association list of members of the cabinet who have defied the government whip this year - sustaining Philip Hammond\u2019s claim that Boris Johnson is being \u201cstaggeringly hypocritical\u201d. (See 8.52am.) Boris Johnson, prime minister: Voted against Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal in first two votes Dominic Raab, foreign secretary: Voted against May\u2019s Brexit deal in first two votes Priti Patel, home secretary: Voted against May\u2019s Brexit deal in all three votes Grant Shapps, transport secretary: Voted against May\u2019s Brexit deal in first two votes Theresa Villiers, environment secretary: Voted against May\u2019s Brexit deal in all three votes Esther McVey, housing minister: Voted against May\u2019s Brexit deal twice Amber Rudd, work and pensions secretary: Abstained in vote on ruling out no-deal Brexit in all circumstances in March, despite government MPs being under orders to vote against Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the Commons: Voted against May\u2019s Brexit deal in first two votes The Tory rebels planning to vote for legislation intended to block a no-deal Brexit on 31 October don\u2019t actually have a leader - Philip Hammond, Sir Oliver Letwin and Rory Stewart are all key players - but they do have a nickname, the Gaukeward squad, making David Gauke, the former justice secretary, at least their eponymous figurehead. On the Today programme this morning Gauke said he thought Boris Johnson was trying to orchestrate an early election. (See 8.52am.) Here are some other lines from his interview. Gauke said he thought there would be a 95% chance of a no-deal Brexit if efforts to legislate to block such a scenario failed in the Commons this week. He said: Frankly, there\u2019s not a credible plan coming from the government to be able to leave with a deal on October 31. I would say it\u2019s a 95% chance, to be honest, that if parliament does not act this week that we will leave without a deal on October 31. He said he had written to Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, asking the government to confirm that it would comply with any legislation passed this week. His letter was triggered by Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, refusing to confirm yesterday that the government would obey such a law. Gauke said: The rule of law is hugely important to this country and I am concerned by some of the briefings that have been put out by the government suggesting that they won\u2019t comply with the law, and I think Michael was equivocal on that question yesterday. I think it would be very helpful if the government could clarify that they believe in the rule of law. That\u2019s why I\u2019m writing to the attorney general and also the lord chancellor [Robert Buckland], who has particular responsibility for this, just to get confirmation that this government believes in the rule of law, that it will comply with the law, and if legislation is properly passed it will be complied with. Good morning. With MPs returning to the House of Commons tomorrow, and the Brexit confrontation between Boris Johnson\u2019s government and parliament set to climax in MPs trying to pass legislation this week to rule out a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, last night Johnson escalated hostilities by, as Jessica Elgot puts it, threatening to \u201cblow up his own parliamentary majority and withdraw the whip from dozens of Conservative MPs if they back plans to stop no-deal Brexit\u201d. Here is the full story. Some of those Tory MPs planning to vote with the opposition to rule out a no-deal Brexit on 31 October are not backing down. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, posted this on Twitter at the weekend, after Johnson\u2019s plan was first revealed in the Sun. David Gauke, the former justice secretary, told the Andrew Marr Show yesterday that he would continue with his rebellion and last night the former Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt backed him. Rory Stewart, the former international development secretary, also said he was willing to lose the whip over this issue. Yesterday Johnson also cancelled a meeting planned for today with the rebels. On the Today programme this morning Gauke said the PM was acting as if he wanted to lose the key votes this week so that he could trigger a general election. Gauke explained: It\u2019s a very odd way [of trying to win round rebel MPs]. Normally there would be plenty of cajoling, friends in the cabinet would be phoning up saying: \u2018Come on, why won\u2019t you support the government, give them a bit more time.\u2019 None of that is happening. The usual operational isn\u2019t particularly happening. It does seem to me that they\u2019re almost goading people into voting against the government because I think their strategy, to be honest, is to lose this week and then seek a general election, having removed those of use who are not against Brexit, not against leaving the European Union, but believe we should do so with a deal. Gauke\u2019s analysis seems very reasonable, and it is in line with what many commentators are saying (for example, see this blogpost from the BBC\u2019s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, and this one from Robert Peston, her opposite number at ITV), but of course under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act calling an election is no longer straightforward. Johnson could only do it with opposition support and that would only be forthcoming if the timing of the election did not make a no-deal Brexit inevitable. Here is the agenda for the day. 9am: Gordon Brown, the former Labour prime minister, gives a speech on a no-deal Brexit at a Hope not Hate event in Liverpool. 9.30am: Tony Blair, another former Labour prime minister, gives a speech on Brexit. As HuffPost reports, he will say Labour should avoid the \u201celephant trap\u201d of a snap general election that could be used to ram through a no-deal Brexit. 11am: Jeremy Corbyn gives a speech in Salford. As Jessica Elgot reports, he will argue that this week\u2019s parliamentary confrontation is a \u201cbattle of the many against the few who are hijacking the referendum result to shift even more power and wealth towards those at the top\u201d. 11am: Downing Street lobby briefing. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although mostly I will be focusing on Brexit. I plan to publish a summary at lunchtime and another when I wrap up late afternoon. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "bodyText": "But I\u2019ll wrap it up there \u2013 Nadal and Cilic are on later, and we\u2019ve a report on Osaka\u2019s shock defeat coming up, so do stay close to the site. Here\u2019s some Johanna Konta latest from Kevin Mitchell, in the meantime. Thanks for your company! Elise Mertens is a set up against Kristie Ahn \u2013 she won that 6-1. He\u2019s done it! And he\u2019s deserved it. A really fun, unpredictable, flamboyant match ends in the Argentinian\u2019s favour on the second match point (he, in keeping with proceedings, fluffed a gift on the first). He sees it through with a booming forehand winner! He does, and fair play to him for that, he was put under severe pressure and taken to deuce but found a couple of huge shots in there. Zverev has really kept at it here when this looked nailed on to be a 0-6 at one point. Now Schwartzman serves for the match at 5-3. Now Zverev needs to gather himself, somehow, and serve out the next game to stay in the match ... Schwartzman, under a bit of pressure on serve, digs it out to 40-15 with a sensational angled volley. And then Zverev gets given another violation for an obscenity ... and is cost a point! What an idiot! He was still in that! He\u2019s claiming he never got a prior warning, or couldn\u2019t hear it. But I could hear it from here in London! It\u2019s 5-2 to Schwartzman. And the tie still has a pulse ... Zverev holds this time, so it\u2019s 4-2, and this next game is not one that Schwartzman will want to let slip. Zverev is still fighting and gets a glimmer of light with a break point, then another ... and breaks! It\u2019s 4-1. And I didn\u2019t say anything in the previous entry, OK? Ok, I will call it now. Zverev manfully saves three break points but ... that\u2019s right ... double faults on the fourth and that\u2019s 4-0. He has made 16 double faults to Schwartzman\u2019s one. There are so many good elements to his game but those have done for him here. Schwartzman makes good the break, is now 3-0 up and can see the lights of home. He\u2019s playing some great stuff now. But, look, this match has been so scattergun that I\u2019m not going to call it quite yet ... Uh-oh, Zverev might not have much left after all. Schwartzman gets two break points in the second game and is absolutely rapid to hunt down a drop shot and return it with interest. He goes 2-0 up in the fourth and could win this from here. Zverev gets a code violation for ball abuse. What has Zverev got left? He\u2019s played a lot more tennis in the last few days than his opponent. We\u2019ll soon see ... Zverev seems to have made it 30-30 with an ace but no, a review finds it was a millimetre wide and he double faults on the second serve! 15-40, then, and two set points, but an absolutely wild Schwartzman forehand sends the ball way off court. Does either player want to win this? Well, Schwartzman takes the third set in the end \u2013 with an absolutely bewitching bit of cat and mouse around the net! 6-4 to Schwartzman and two sets to one up. A relatively easy hold for once, Schwartzman serving out to make it 5-4 and put pressure on Zverev\u2019s serve. And if there\u2019s one thing Zverev can\u2019t handle that well, it\u2019s pressure on his serve. We\u2019re two hours, 18 minutes in and not quite at the business end of the third set yet. These two players are both highly flawed but they\u2019re giving it everything, slugging out from the baseline but producing some deft touches too. We could be here all night. Zverev holds for 4-4 but nobody is running away with anything here. A nip-and-tuck third set there, but far more straightforward than Zverev-Schwartzman! Zverev\u2019s 12th and 13th double faults give Schwartzman the chance to break back in an epic sixth game of the set. The latter correctly challenges a serve that was called good on his third break point and capitalises, making it 3-3! This is a fraught, frayed rollercoaster. And now Zverev takes his chance, gets his break! He leads 3-2. Goodness knows what will happen from here. At 30-30 in the next game, these two pull out an absolutely epic 35-shot rally that Zverev pulls out of the bag with a delightful slice down the line that totally foxes his adversary. It\u2019s a bit of a wild match, this \u2013 never quite know what\u2019s going to happen next. In this case, Zverev shows guts to make it 2-2. Big chance for Zverev at 0-40 on the Schwartzman serve, and 1-1, but he loses his head and the next five points. He\u2019s really let his opponent off there, and is letting too many good chances slip. 2-1 Schwartzman on serve. Schwartzman breaks yet again and wins the second set 6-2! It\u2019s one set all and Zverev needs to sort this out. He is crumbling. We are seeing some sensational rallies just now and some fine variation from Schwartzman, who is flamboyant at his best and this time goes 5-2 up in the second set with some wonderful play. Now Schwartzman breaks after *yet another* Zverev double fault and he\u2019s got another chance to take firm control of the set. 4-2. Berrettini has won the second set too and leads 6-1, 6-4. We\u2019re still just about on serve, at 3-2 Schwartzman, but these are very tight games at the moment with some long, meaty rallies to enjoy. The most recent one saw Zverev pass up on FOUR break points! It is so wet at Flushing Meadows that the sound of the rain drilling against the roof is quite off-putting even for those of us watching on telly. And he breaks back! This match is all over the place at the moment. 2-1 Schwartzman, on serve. Zverev finally falls apart on serve again and Schwartzman breaks for 2-0. Those double faults are so costly and if he can\u2019t, somehow, rid himself of this demon then he will lose this match despite being a set up as we stand. Berrettini is a break up in the second against Rublev now, so he could be about to run away with it. Schwartzman takes it to 15-15 in one of the best rallies you will see all tournament, retrieving the point at one stage with an impudent flick from between his legs. It seems to put his tail up as Zverev double-faults for the SIXTH time and is then taken to 15-40. Zverev digs in and returns it to deuce with some rapier-like groundstrokes, and then earns a set point. It\u2019s an exceptional game, this particular one. Zverev sees it through and takes the first set 6-3! Schwartzman stays alive and now Zverev serves for the set ... Zverev has broken and, despite losing a point on his own serve after a wonderful lob from his opponent, gone on to confirm that break! It\u2019s 5-2 to the German. Berrettini has thrashed Rublev 6-1 in the first set! It\u2019s a lot tighter in the one I\u2019m watching currently although Zverev looks very shaky on serve. He\u2019s 3-2 up though, with Schwartzman serving. I\u2019ve got Zverev and Schwartzman, the sixth and 20th seeds, on my telly so we\u2019ll keep our weather eye on that one for the time being. Zverev was two games down, I should say, before breaking back. So \u2013 at the moment Zverev and Schwartzman are on serve at 2-2, while Berrettini is a break up at 4-1. On soon: Zverev v Schwartzman and Rublev v Berrettini \u2013 we\u2019ll join them in a little while. What a day\u2019s tennis we\u2019ve had so far! Wow. There\u2019s a little break now so I\u2019m off to grab a bite to eat, won\u2019t be long. Do send in your assessments of what we\u2019ve seen, in the meantime! An emotional Vekic speaks: \u201cI don\u2019t know how I won this match, she had match point but I just kept fighting and believing I would win. It feels pretty amazing to play [here] and have such amazing support. I was just trying to get the ball in the court, she was serving amazingly today, but I was feeling confident in the rallies but I knew that if I could get those returns in I\u2019d have an advantage.\u201d Vekic and Bencic \u2013 who are good friends \u2013 will face each other in the last eight! Goerges wastes two break points and then, on match point to Vekic, fluffs a doable overhead. Vekic wins the longest women\u2019s match of the US Open so far at two hours, 42 minutes \u2013 an absolute thriller from both players. Goerges will be absolutely kicking herself at how she let that slip in the second, but will hopefully reflect that, like her opponent, she put on a great show overall. And the action keeps on coming as Vekic has just broken Goerges in the final set ... after another double fault from Goerges! Vekic leads 5-3 and will serve for the match! Bencic speaks: \u201cI was so excited to come on the court, the challenge could not be bigger so I had to be on top of my game, I\u2019m really pleased with how I played and how I managed my nerves in the end. Taking the serve early, trying to anticipate because she has a lot of power ... I\u2019m not the person with the most winners or aces, I had to play it a bit like chess with tactics on the court.\u201d Tumaini is on the scene. Bencic can\u2019t stop smiling, she\u2019s dancing and clenching her fists. What a bold performance it was. This women\u2019s tournament is absolutely anyone\u2019s now! Bencic wins 7-5, 6-4 against a clearly troubled opponent and, after letting Osaka back in it for a while in the first set, that was a supreme performance from the Swiss. She goes through! Osaka takes a drink and looks at a sheet of notes. \u201cBreak back, pronto,\u201d it probably doesn\u2019t read. A slightly wobbly hold to 30 from Osaka, and now we reach the crux: can Bencic hold her nerve for a stunning victory? She leads 5-4 and is a set up. Vekic and Goerges are inseparable at 3-3 in the third, incidentally. It may well be Osaka\u2019s knee injury \u2013 her left one, which is strapped \u2013 that forced her to miss Cincinatti, that\u2019s troubling her. At 30-0 to Bencic she defies any pain to slam down a winner but Bencic comes out on top and needs to win just one game now. Osaka is taken from 40-0 back to 40-30, via a lovely feathered touch at the net by Bencic and an unforced error, but holds for 3-4. The crowd are in the mood to get right behind her \u2013 and she\u2019ll need them now. Bencic eases her back in with a double fault. But the Swiss recovers to win the match\u2019s best rally so far for 15-15, and then goes on \u2013 via some more huge hitting from both women \u2013 to take arguably the most important hold so far. 4-2 to the Swiss, and a set up. Play will continue now. I\u2019m not quite sure what all that was about. The physio is on to see Osaka and I wonder if it\u2019s more a useful time for the defending champion, who is on the edge of tumbling out here, to take a bit of a time out. There\u2019s currently more conversation than treatment going on. Bencic breaks Osaka\u2019s serve and she is now well in control of this match! Osaka misjudges a volley with most of the court gaping and sees it swatted past her for 0-40 ... then she double faults and it\u2019s 3-2 to Bencic, with a break, and a set up! Osaka holds again and then gets a glimmer on Bencic\u2019s serve at 15-30. She can\u2019t make it count, just when Bencic was starting to look a little wobbly. 2-2 in the second, and as you were. Osaka makes short work of her first service game in the second set and will hope to continue in that vein. Bencic then does similar. And Vekic has levelled the match against Goerges, coming back from the very, very edge to win the second set 7-5. A thriller there \u2013 I gather Goerges served three double faults when the match was there to be won! Incredible. Bencic takes the first set against Osaka, 7-5! And what credit you have to give her here. It came at the second time of asking, after she double faulted first time out. She seemed to have crumbled after that great start but stayed in the set doggedly and then rediscovered her best form towards the end. The reigning champion has a problem here! Well, well, well! Bencic breaks Osaka with a fine, clean backhand. That was her at her assertive best from earlier; she leads 6-5 in the first, and a break up! Two more holds in Bencic-Osaka to make it 5-5. After a fast start it\u2019s settled down now, with both players having their moments but looking strong on serve. Vekic has saved two match points and levelled the second set against Goerges! 5-5 and game on. Holds for both players here in a fairly uneventful phase. 4-4 in the first set. Now Bencic holds serve and she needed that. Goerges, meanwhile, leads Vekic 5-3 in the second and is on the verge of going through. Bencic is starting to get a little rash, while Osaka is producing some awesomely powerful strokes. On serve, it\u2019s now 3-2 to Osaka. That last game must have cleared Osaka\u2019s head because now she earns two break points. She takes the first through a Bencic error and levels the set \u2013 2-2! Goerges has kept that break against Vekic. She leads 3-1, and by a set. Bencic earns another break point, with Osaka yet to get going at all. It\u2019s fended off well, and then another one is too, but what about a third? That\u2019s saved too but, my word, Bencic is striking the ball well. A fourth break point is then saved and Osaka is really at full stretch early on here. Eventually she gets out of the hole and off the mark \u2013 to some relief. It\u2019s 2-1 Bencic, with a break. And it\u2019s a comfortable hold from Bencic, who leads 2-0. Osaka serves first and Bencic shows instantly that she\u2019ll be assertive, winning the first point via a deep forehand. Then she forces a break point with a superb, radar-like backhand ... and takes it after Osaka double faults. Some start here! 1-0 Bencic. I can tell you, before we get stuck into Osaka-Bencic, that Goerges has gone a break up in the second \u2013 it\u2019s 2-0 and she looks set fair for victory. We\u2019re into the second set but Osaka and Bencic are about to get underway and we\u2019re going to head over to that for the time being. I\u2019ll keep you posted on how this one is panning out! Goerges fired down seven aces in that first set, and 22 winners! Her opponent? No aces and five winners. But Goerges made 16 unforced errors to Vekic\u2019s seven. She takes it! Goerges wins the first set 7-6 (7-5) and yells with delight. Goerges whips out a sensational backhand winner down the line on Vekic\u2019s serve, and has a set point at 6-5! Then a cross-court shot from Goerges on the Vekic serve is called good by the umpire, overruling the line judge, and now she has the mini-break. Can she take advantage? No \u2013 she double-faults too! Vekic gets a mini-break but then double-faults and it\u2019s 3-3 at the change of ends. That\u2019s a golden chance wasted. Goerges powers through another service game, leaving us to wonder where it all went wrong mid-set. She can have another nibble at Vekic now, and takes it to deuce with her eighth forehand winner so far ... but Vekic responds appropriately and we have a tie break! Decent hold from Vekic to 15, her first serve purring at the moment. It\u2019s 5-5 and might well go the distance. Back to her earlier form from Goerges there though, hitting her 14th winner down the line for 40-0 and then serving it out to put pressure on Vekic\u2019s serve at 5-4. Vekic, now looking the stronger player, holds to 15 for 4-4 and you wouldn\u2019t bet against her going on to win this set now. Vekic again holds comfortably and finds a nice pass on Goerges\u2019 serve for 15-15. Then she forces her first break point of the match ... and takes it! Vekic levels to get things back on serve, it\u2019s 4-3 to Goerges. Goerges holds well for 4-1 and they\u2019ll now change ends. Vekic needs to step things up considerably on her opponent\u2019s serve here. Rich writes in: \u201cHe was obviously injured from the match before last but consistently refused to answer media questions about it, in fact saying more than once that he was good and ready to play. We fans base our decisions to invest a lot of time and money on these statements. Also the sports culture here in the US demands more transparency about injuries. So yes, boo to Novak (as great as he is) for intentionally misleading us.\u201d I do take this point but it just seems a bit habitual from that particular crowd. Much, much better from Vekic here. She finds a few sweet groundstrokes to hold for love and get off the mark. She\u2019s still a break down though at 3-1. It\u2019s wet in New York \u2013 good job the roof is on here! Goerges is serving superbly and holds for 3-0, via a failed challenge from Vekic who thought an ace should have been called out. Well, well \u2013 Goerges breaks Vekic at the first time of asking, doing so to love. She has started very assertively indeed and leads 2-0. And we get underway! Goerges serves first and moves 30-0 up with a sweet double-handed backhand winner. But Vekic is hitting the ball well too and pulls to 30-30, before Goerges serves it out to go 1-0 up. Vekic and Goerges are out on court at Louis Armstrong. Neither player has ever gone beyond this stage at a US Open before, and Vekic hasn\u2019t reached a grand slam last-eight at all. What gives this time? Where Bencic and Osaka are concerned, we\u2019re reminded that Bencic leads the head-to-head 2-1. That starts in about an hour and I think there is every chance it might go all the way ... We won\u2019t see Johanna Konta today \u2013 but if she has her way we\u2019ll get several more chances over the rest of the week! Vekic is yet to drop a set at this US Open; Goerges has dropped one, in her opening-round win over Natalia Viklyantseva. It should be a very close match given that, in terms both of ranking and seeding, you can barely separate them. Play in the Vekic-Goerges match starts in around about 40 minutes. You can send in your emails and tweets to the addresses above if you\u2019d like to provide your observations, on that tie or any other aspect of the US Open so far!

Top stories Boris Johnson has publicly threatened to ignore the UK parliament if it mandates an extension to Brexit, saying there were \u201cno circumstances\u201d under which departure would not happen on 31 October. The prime minister said he would call a snap general election next month if the Commons pushes ahead with a bill tabled by a cross-party group of backbenchers seeking to block no deal. Johnson said publicly in a televised address he did not want an election. But No 10 briefings openly threatened one on 14 October if Tory rebels did not back down. But at least 17 Tory MPs said they had not been deterred from voting to stop a no-deal Brexit, as the EU considers whether to declare no-deal a \u201cmajor natural disaster\u201d. Terrifying video footage is emerging from the Bahamas, where more than 13,000 houses have been destroyed or severely damaged by Hurricane Dorian. A full picture of the devastation has yet to become clear, with communications disrupted and emergency numbers down, as the intense storm barely moved on Monday from its position over the northern Bahamas. Meanwhile millions in the coastal US have been warned to \u201cget out now\u201d as the most powerful Atlantic cyclone of modern times set its sights on the US mainland. Follow our live blog for updates. The Australian Medical Association has formally declared climate change a health emergency, pointing to \u201cclear scientific evidence indicating severe impacts for our patients and communities now and into the future\u201d. The AMA\u2019s landmark shift, delivered by a motion of the body\u2019s federal council, brings the organisation into line with positions taken by the American Medical Association, the British Medical Association and Doctors for the Environment Australia. Meanwhile the tech company Atlassian has joined an alliance of companies urging business to support this month\u2019s climate strikes. World A leaked audio recording has emerged in which Hong Kong\u2019s leader, Carrie Lam, can be heard saying she would quit if she had \u201ca choice\u201d, suggesting she was being prevented from doing so by authorities in Beijing. Up to 34 people are feared dead off the coast of southern California after a diving boat caught fire in the early hours of Monday morning, with crew members jumping off the deck to escape, while passengers were asleep below decks. Iran and France have moved closer in their views on the future of Tehran\u2019s nuclear deal with the west after talks between the countries\u2019 presidents, the Iranian government has said. A Chinese app, Zao, that uses deepfake technology to allow users to convincingly swap their faces with film or TV characters has triggered a privacy row after rapidly become one of the country\u2019s most downloaded apps. Greta Thunberg has spoken about her Asperger\u2019s syndrome diagnosis after she was criticised over the condition, saying it makes her a \u201cdifferent\u201d but that she considers it a \u201csuperpower\u201d. Opinion and analysis Volunteers in Salvador\u2019s favelas are collecting data on deadly infections and inequality to help campaign for better sanitation. \u201cWearing crisp, white T-shirts and carrying tablets, the students fan out through Marechal Rondon, a bustling favela spread over hillsides and a valley in Brazil\u2019s north-eastern city of Salvador,\u201d writes Dom Phillips. \u201cAs they walk, they map blocked drains and piles of rubbish on their tablets. These are the \u201cinfection points\u201d that attract the rats and mosquitoes which, in turn, spread diseases like leptospirosis and the Zika virus, both prevalent here.\u201d The data leading to the release of Australia\u2019s GDP figures on Wednesday indicate that the economy will remain weak. The government doesn\u2019t seem to expect decent figures as the prime minister suggests ignoring the figures and waiting for the ones to come out in three months\u2019 time, writes Greg Jericho: \u201cThat\u2019s all well and good, except of course the government was in charge for the five-and-a-half years before the June quarter, so it\u2019s a bit rich to say ignore that and wait for September when our plan starts working.\u201d Sport The US\u2019s Naomi Osaka is out of the US Open, beaten 7-5, 6-4 by Switzerland\u2019s Belinda Bencic. Donna Vekic fought back to defeat Julia Georges in three sets. Steve Smith has been told to expect a brutal return to the Test arena on Wednesday, when Australia take on England in the fourth Test at Old Trafford, with Jofra Archer said to be eager for round two of their Ashes duel. Thinking time: How a new pill could spell the end of ageing The science of extending life is a subject of morbid fascination, conjuring the image of old billionaires being cryogenically frozen. But imagine if, instead of a pill you could take to live forever, there was a pill that could push back the ageing process \u2013 a medicine that could stave off the fragility, osteoarthritis, memory loss, macular degeneration and cancers that plague old age. It could happen, with the science of senolytics: an emerging \u2013 and highly anticipated \u2013 area of anti-ageing medicine. Many of the world\u2019s top gerontologists have already demonstrated the possibilities in animals and are now beginning human clinical trials, with promising results. If the studies continue to be as successful as hoped, those who are currently middle-aged could become the first generation of oldies who are youthful for longer \u2013 with a little medical help. Media roundup The Age and the Sydney Morning Herald declare that the economy is \u201con the brink of a 20-year low\u201d, but the Herald splashes on the latest from the Independent Commission Against Corruption, reporting that the former state MP Ernest Wong rejected a claim that he disguised a $100,000 donation. The Australian reports that some of Australia\u2019s biggest companies have failed to change auditors for decades \u201craising concerns about a heightened risk of corporate disasters under a practice that has been outlawed in Britain and Europe\u201d. Coming up The former US secretary of state John Kerry will deliver the keynote address to the Global Table future of food conference in Melbourne. Former Labor MP Ernest Wong will continue to give evidence before the NSW anti-corruption inquiry into a potentially unlawful donations scheme.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has issued a final Brexit ultimatum to rebel MPs by pledging to call a snap general election next month if the House of Commons pushes ahead with a bill tabled by a cross-party group of backbenchers seeking to block no deal. In a carefully choreographed sequence, Johnson held an emergency cabinet meeting, addressed Conservative MPs at a Downing Street reception and then made a live television address outside No 10 to say there were \u201cno circumstances\u201d under which departure from the EU would not happen on 31 October. Johnson said in his televised address, which was punctuated by chants from protestors at the gates of Downing Street, that he did not want an election. But No 10 briefings openly threatened one on 14 October if rebels did not back down. Johnson said the backbench bill, signed by the former chancellor Philip Hammond, the ex-justice secretary David Gauke and others, would \u201cchop the legs out\u201d from the UK\u2019s Brexit negotiations. The bill, which the MPs hope to push through parliament at high speed if they seize control of the Commons timetable on Tuesday, would mandate Johnson to extend departure until 31 January, unless MPs backed a deal or approved no deal. Downing Street spelled out the consequences for rebel Conservative MPs, already threatened with losing the party whip, if they pushed ahead with the plan and took over the Commons timetable. A No 10 source said the vote on proceeding with the backbench bill would be seen as the equivalent of a confidence motion in the government. If it passed, the government would consider seeking a snap election on 14 October, using the 2011 Fixed-Term Parliaments Act (FTPA). This threat would then be withdrawn if the bill did not succeed. \u201cMPs are effectively considering tomorrow whether to hand control of the negotiations to Jeremy Corbyn,\u201d the source said. \u201cThat would be shooting ourselves in the foot and if Conservative MPs help him to make no deal illegal tomorrow, and therefore create another pointless delay, the government\u2019s negotiating position will be wrecked. What they are effectively voting for is to hold a rapid election. And they will have to explain what they are doing.\u201d The Guardian understands the plan has been under consideration for a number of days but was \u201ccrystallised\u201d by the seeming determination of MPs to press on with the legislation despite threats of deselection. One source said they believed it could significantly limit the number of rebels. \u201cSome MPs have clearly made up their minds but more than you would think are quietly considering if this is really how they want their political careers to end,\u201d the source said. \u201cYou cannot get around that fact, that will be the consequence.\u201d Under the FTPA, the government can trigger an election if two-thirds of MPs support it. With Labour backing an election if it did not take place after 31 October, this would be expected to pass, with Downing Street bullish the election would be called. Senior rebel Tories and Labour MPs are sceptical Johnson would stick to his word and call an election before 31 October, though government sources ruled out any chance of changing the date after MPs had voted. \u201cA prime minister would need to be in place before European council on 17 October,\u201d the source said. \u201cIf you are to have any chance of securing a deal, you must have an election before then, and the prime minister has been very clear he wants to get a deal.\u201d Another Downing Street source said there was no serious consideration given to calling an election after 31 October \u2013 and they hoped MPs would take that as proof Johnson was intent on securing a deal. \u201cIt is a very deliberate choice to call it before 31 October; this is his commitment to getting a deal, that should not be overlooked by MPs tomorrow who say they want to see that proof,\u201d the source said. A source close to the group of Conservative MPs opposed to no deal suggested the group was holding firm. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit rich for the prime minister to point the finger at colleagues who plan to defy the party whip \u2013 colleagues who voted for a deal three times \u2013 while he voted with Jeremy Corbyn to inflict the two biggest parliamentary defeats on a government in British history,\u201d the source said. \u201cThe prime minister seems to be doing everything he can to bring about an election, while claiming it\u2019s the last thing he wants.\u201d If an election is called for Monday 14 October it would be the first since 1931 not to be held on a Thursday. If Johnson loses it, he will become Britain\u2019s shortest-serving prime minister. In Johnson\u2019s brief and occasionally halting public address outside the door of No 10, in parts almost drowned out by boos and chants of \u201cStop the coup\u201d from protesters, he condemned the backbench plan, published shortly beforehand. He said he was \u201cencouraged by the progress we are making\u201d in talks with Brussels on a new deal, but said moves by MPs to block no deal or extend Brexit would weaken the UK\u2019s negotiating stance. \u201cIf there is one thing that can hold us back in these talks it is the sense in Brussels that MPs may find some way to cancel the referendum,\u201d he said, adding that he hoped this would not happen. \u201cBut if they do, they will plainly chop the legs out from under the UK position and make any further negotiation absolutely impossible. I want everybody to know \u2013 there are no circumstances in which I will ask Brussels to delay. We are leaving on 31 October, no ifs or buts. We will not accept any attempt to go back on our promises or scrub that referendum.\u201d Claiming parliament would have time to scrutinise any deal, Johnson said that, in the interim, the UK\u2019s negotiating team should be allowed to work \u201cwithout that sword of Damocles over their necks, and without an election, which I don\u2019t want and you don\u2019t want\u201d. Shortly beforehand, the Labour MP Hilary Benn tabled the final version of the rebels\u2019 bill aimed at stopping a no-deal Brexit, which would mandate Johnson to seek an extension for three months until 31 January. The bill says an extension must be sought if the prime minister has not passed a new Brexit agreement by 19 October \u2013 the day after a key European council meeting \u2013 unless MPs have passed a motion approving a no-deal Brexit. The bill states Johnson must otherwise write to the president of the European council requesting an extension is set out in a schedule to the bill. However, controversially, it also states Johnson must accept any alternative extension offered by the EU, though that must be put to a vote in parliament. If both sides agree a deal after 19 October but before 31 January, Brexit could happen sooner but the bill also does not state what would then happen if there was still no agreement by the end of January. Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said the bill would \u201cstop Boris Johnson forcing through a reckless and damaging no deal Brexit\u201d and urged MPs to back it. Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, who held a shadow cabinet meeting in Salford on Monday, said the party was \u201cready for a general election, which will be a once in a generation chance for a real change of direction for our country\u201d. The mood among Conservative MPs appears distinctly more mixed, with rebels led by Hammond and Gauke increasingly flexing their muscles. Hammond tweeted a letter he had written to Johnson seeking details on Johnson\u2019s proposed changes to the withdrawal agreement. On Monday night Gauke confirmed to the Times that he would vote against the party whip. Even some publicly loyal Tories said they had grave doubts about an election. \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say I\u2019m not energised by this,\u201d one MP said. \u201cSnap elections are a physically, emotionally and politically draining experience anyway, and this feels very risky for the party and divisive for the country. \u201cBut I think Boris is very tempted. He might think it\u2019ll be a silver bullet for all his problems \u2013 get rid of the rebels and win a majority.

One backbench rebel said they did not want to spend an evening with \u201cEnglish nationalists\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Justin Langer, Australia\u2019s hugely quotable head coach, said he felt physically sick after watching Ben Stokes snatch the Headingley Test from his side\u2019s grasp, such that he did not know whether to cry his eyes out or smash up his hotel room that evening. The question now, as this summer\u2019s Ashes heads into its final stretch at 1-1 starting with Wednesday\u2019s fourth Test at Old Trafford, is how much the galling nature of that one-wicket defeat \u2013 the 10th-wicket stand of 76 between Stokes and Jack Leach, the fluffed run out, the declined lbw \u2013 has affected his players. On the surface all seems fine. They made light work of Derbyshire last week and at training on Monday, while frustrated by the soggy nets, spirits were high. Even Nathan Lyon, whose butter-fingers blew a chance to retain the urn with two Tests to spare, was game for a laugh, sporting a pair of Budgy Smuggler swimming trunks with his face on the backside that he was using in lieu of a jockstrap. But Stuart Broad, three times Australia\u2019s nemesis during Ashes defeats on English soil, remains convinced there will be lingering effects. \u201cThe language they will have been using is \u2018let\u2019s forget about it quickly and move on\u2019 but any loss hangs over you for a period of time,\u201d he said. \u201cA loss where you feel like you could have, or should have, won is going to stay with you.\u201d Langer, who has welcomed back Steve Waugh as the group\u2019s mentor after a spell back at home, said he has relished the past week in the job, claimed to be proud of their response and cited the example of Muhammad Ali\u2019s formative years as inspiration for the challenge ahead. \u201cThe champions all have had times of adversity,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s in business, sport or life. Think about Muhammad Ali getting his bike stolen [aged 12]. That was the fire he needed to become the greatest boxer of all time. \u201cWe felt a bit like we got the Ashes stolen the other day and to England\u2019s great credit, that\u2019s what they did. Now we have got to work out what we\u2019re going to do and use that as fire. We\u2019re not going to feel sorry for ourselves and let it slip.\u201d Australia have cause for optimism in terms of selection, at least, given they welcome back the mighty Steve Smith from concussion. Marnus Labuschagne has deputised superbly with three successive half-centuries, with news filtering through on Monday night that they have opted to drop Usman Khawaja and retain the less experienced Marcus Harris as an opener. James Pattinson will be rested, with Peter Siddle and Mitchell Starc competing for the third seamer\u2019s spot. England, by contrast, continue to shuffle the same pack. Joe Denly, fresh from a crucial half-century in Leeds in a vital stand of 126 with Joe Root, has confirmed he will now be opening, meaning Jason Roy has a new role at No 4 away from the new ball. The hosts are also mulling over whether to rest Chris Woakes, whom Root does not appear to fancy, and draft in either Sam Curran\u2019s left-arm swingers or the bounce of Craig Overton. Both are feisty competitors but neither of them is the now ruled-out Jimmy Anderson. It is the batting that chiefly vexes Root and co. Did Stokes and his epic, unbeaten 135 paper over the cracks exposed by their woeful 67 all out in the first innings? For Broad, it was the collective response \u2013 rather than one man\u2019s performance \u2013 that must inform their approach in Manchester. He said: \u201cA lot of good things came from that second innings. The whole group will take energy from how Denly, Root and Stokes batted. You don\u2019t need to be 30 from 30 balls in Test cricket, if you take your time and stick to your strengths, batting gets easier. As soon as you get to 20 overs in Test cricket as a bowler, you\u2019re writing cheques your body can\u2019t cash. So take bowlers deep into an innings and you can hurt them. That was a great template, not just winning that game but how Test cricket should be played. \u201cWe can take huge momentum out of the way we did that into Old Trafford and the Oval. These could be the best two pitches of the series to bat on. Let\u2019s make hay.\u201d All this talk goes only so far. The true answers to the head-scratchers both sides face will play out over the coming days.",

One source close to the rebel group said the mood had hardened, especially since briefing began that Johnson was planning a snap election after MPs were deselected. \u201cThis is a pathetic attempt to find an excuse for a general election,\u201d one former cabinet minister said. \u201cIronically this is doing what Corbyn wants \u2013 is Dominic Cummings a sleeper agent?\u201d Others said they had been explicitly turned against the government because of the shock cancellation of the meeting with Johnson. \u201cThe only thing that would change my mind is if I was shown detail of a deal that is being brokered,\u201d one former minister said. \u201cBut it is like the emperor\u2019s new clothes.\u201d However, several Tory MPs who have been vocally against no deal are not prepared to vote to give the rebels control of the order paper, especially given the briefing from No 10 that this move would be seen as a confidence vote against Johnson. The Guardian understands this group includes MPs such as Dame Caroline Spelman, one of the sponsors of a motion against no deal earlier this year, and the former foreign office minister Alan Duncan. Tory whips are attempting to draw a distinction between MPs who are voting with their conscience to stop no deal and those who will vote to hand control of the order paper to rebel and opposition MPs in order for a bill to pass. It is the latter group that No 10 says it believes are in effect voting against the government in a confidence vote \u2013 by taking the power to control parliamentary business away from a Conservative administration \u2013 and it is those MPs who will lose the whip. Senior Tory sources said they believed it was possible to significantly reduce the number of rebels with the threats of an election and a confidence vote \u2013 and that there could be enough Labour Brexiteers to deliver a victory for the government. However, it is understood a number of Labour MPs who have in the past voted against moves to derail Brexit, including Gareth Snell, Melanie Onn and Yvonne Fovargue, are not planning to defy the Labour whip. \u201cI think there are a number of us who will back another delay with gritted teeth and with no optimism but watching how this government is behaving, it is extremely hard to believe they are pursuing any meaningful Brexit deal,\u201d one Labour MP said. \u201cMany more of us could possibly vote for a Brexit deal now if one was on the table but we see no evidence that is realistic and we believe no deal would be deeply damaging.\u201d",

There was a shocker from Granit Xhaka for Tottenham\u2019s second goal \u2013 a ludicrously rash challenge that gave away a penalty, which Kane converted.</p> <p>But the broader picture concerns how Arsenal set up, with the full-backs pressed high, David Luiz eager to spark attacking transitions and questions over the configuration of the midfield. The upshot is that teams can find space behind the Arsenal defence and between the lines \u2013 particularly on counterattacks when the game is stretched.</p> <p>Sead Kolasinac is extremely dangerous when barrelling forward from left-back and blasting in those low crosses but is he sound enough defensively? Ars\u00e8ne Wenger once said he would not use Kolasinac as a left-back, only as a left wing\u2011back. The hope at Arsenal is that they will look more secure when H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn and Kieran Tierney are fit to play at right- and left-back respectively, although Emery will still demand they press high. Perhaps their pace will get them out of trouble on the defensive transitions.</p> <p>\u201cWe can score against everybody but the key is always the balance with the defence,\u201d Leno said. \u201cThat is the most important thing. The three players up top, with P\u00e9p\u00e9 there now \u2026 we have unbelievable quality. They can score the big chances but also score from nothing. The other teams have to be aware we have a lot of dangerous players and that gives us big confidence.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/sep/02/tottenham-arsenal-mauricio-pochettino\">Tottenham\u2019s second-half weariness shows Arsenal are now the fitter team | Jonathan Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Emery also talked about balance after the Spurs game. He knows it is delicate; so difficult to get right. It was notable he dropped Dani Ceballos, the creative midfielder, because to start him along with the front three might have been too attack-minded, too risky. He began with a more solid midfield three \u2013 with Matt\u00e9o Guendouzi, called up by France on Monrday for the injured Paul Pogba, outstanding \u2013 and sent on Ceballos for Lucas Torreira when Arsenal were chasing the game. Whither Mesut \u00d6zil, who was unused on the bench? Could Emery accommodate him from the start in a system with his new front three? \u00d6zil continues to feel like a problem for Emery.</p> <p>The manager must also wrestle with the question of whether Aubameyang can play to the point of maximum expression off the left. It is clear Lacazette must play in the centre but Aubameyang, too, tends to look more threatening in the middle. He scored Arsenal\u2019s equaliser against Spurs shortly after being switched to centre-forward, following Lacazette\u2019s substitution.</p> <p>What is plain is that Emery\u2019s team will be fun to watch. The old chant about it being \u201cone-nil to the Arsenal\u201d may need an update.</p>",

There was a shocker from Granit Xhaka for Tottenham\u2019s second goal \u2013 a ludicrously rash challenge that gave away a penalty, which Kane converted. But the broader picture concerns how Arsenal set up, with the full-backs pressed high, David Luiz eager to spark attacking transitions and questions over the configuration of the midfield. The upshot is that teams can find space behind the Arsenal defence and between the lines \u2013 particularly on counterattacks when the game is stretched. Sead Kolasinac is extremely dangerous when barrelling forward from left-back and blasting in those low crosses but is he sound enough defensively? Ars\u00e8ne Wenger once said he would not use Kolasinac as a left-back, only as a left wing\u2011back. The hope at Arsenal is that they will look more secure when H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn and Kieran Tierney are fit to play at right- and left-back respectively, although Emery will still demand they press high. Perhaps their pace will get them out of trouble on the defensive transitions. \u201cWe can score against everybody but the key is always the balance with the defence,\u201d Leno said. \u201cThat is the most important thing. The three players up top, with P\u00e9p\u00e9 there now \u2026 we have unbelievable quality. They can score the big chances but also score from nothing. The other teams have to be aware we have a lot of dangerous players and that gives us big confidence.\u201d Emery also talked about balance after the Spurs game. He knows it is delicate; so difficult to get right. It was notable he dropped Dani Ceballos, the creative midfielder, because to start him along with the front three might have been too attack-minded, too risky. He began with a more solid midfield three \u2013 with Matt\u00e9o Guendouzi, called up by France on Monrday for the injured Paul Pogba, outstanding \u2013 and sent on Ceballos for Lucas Torreira when Arsenal were chasing the game. Whither Mesut \u00d6zil, who was unused on the bench? Could Emery accommodate him from the start in a system with his new front three? \u00d6zil continues to feel like a problem for Emery. The manager must also wrestle with the question of whether Aubameyang can play to the point of maximum expression off the left. It is clear Lacazette must play in the centre but Aubameyang, too, tends to look more threatening in the middle. He scored Arsenal\u2019s equaliser against Spurs shortly after being switched to centre-forward, following Lacazette\u2019s substitution. What is plain is that Emery\u2019s team will be fun to watch. The old chant about it being \u201cone-nil to the Arsenal\u201d may need an update.",

The prime minister said he did not want an election, understandable given that he has just entered No 10. The truth is he has a parliamentary majority of one and would struggle even to pass a Queen\u2019s speech. If thwarted by a combination of Labour votes and those of his own MPs, Mr Johnson would attempt to popularise a no-deal EU exit in an election, blaming a liberal elite for stopping Brexit. This would counter the threat of the Brexit party and also crowd out his opponents\u2019 truthful message of no-deal doom.</p> <p>Jeremy Corbyn has repeatedly called for an early election. Labour does not actually need to vote against a motion for an early election; its MPs could <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/fever-mounts-over-election-dogfight-as-johnson-accused-of-planning-purge-a4226761.html\" title=\"\">deny</a> the government a two-thirds majority by abstaining. The risk here is that Mr Johnson would be able to stoke the belief in leave-voting constituencies that Mr Corbyn was either frit or a remainer. It is hard to see how Labour could not accept Mr Johnson\u2019s challenge. Hostility to immigration was central to the 2016 leave victory. Since access to the EU\u2019s single market and the customs union are irreconcilable with ending free movement of its citizens, Brexiters ought to level with the public over the issue of immigration. But they instead prefer to appeal in populist fashion to voters \u2013 yesterday\u2019s \u201cbogus asylum seekers\u201d are today\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7413863/Migrants-storm-Kent-beaches-Border-Force-intercepts-army-50-intruders-landing-Dover.html\" title=\"\">migrants storming English</a> beaches.</p> <p>Since 2007, the UK has been run by six regimes, five Tory and one Labour. But only one has obtained high office by winning a parliamentary majority at a general election \u2013 and David Cameron\u2019s mistakes provide an abject lesson of how power not only corrupts but also breeds folly. Being in command often causes a failure to think; the responsibility of power fades as it is exercised. Governments need to be constrained by facts. There ought to be detailed white papers setting out the consequences of departure, rather than a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-49545743\" title=\"\">\u201cGet ready for Brexit\u201d</a> information blitz. All misgovernment is contrary to self-interest in the long run, however much it might strengthen a regime temporarily. An election victory for a hard Brexit Tory party would come at a dismal cost to the country: not only would we perversely persist with a counter-productive and probably unworkable EU exit but we will be doomed to sterile enmity with our nearest friends and partners. </p>",

So from the steps of Downing Street he called on Tory MPs not to vote with the opposition, warning this would \u201cchop the legs\u201d from under the UK. Yet European leaders say there is nothing to talk about. Even Mr Johnson\u2019s idea that the Irish backstop could be replaced by alternative arrangements is demonstrably false. The prime minister said he did not want an election, understandable given that he has just entered No 10. The truth is he has a parliamentary majority of one and would struggle even to pass a Queen\u2019s speech. If thwarted by a combination of Labour votes and those of his own MPs, Mr Johnson would attempt to popularise a no-deal EU exit in an election, blaming a liberal elite for stopping Brexit. This would counter the threat of the Brexit party and also crowd out his opponents\u2019 truthful message of no-deal doom. Jeremy Corbyn has repeatedly called for an early election. Labour does not actually need to vote against a motion for an early election; its MPs could deny the government a two-thirds majority by abstaining. The risk here is that Mr Johnson would be able to stoke the belief in leave-voting constituencies that Mr Corbyn was either frit or a remainer. It is hard to see how Labour could not accept Mr Johnson\u2019s challenge. Hostility to immigration was central to the 2016 leave victory. Since access to the EU\u2019s single market and the customs union are irreconcilable with ending free movement of its citizens, Brexiters ought to level with the public over the issue of immigration. But they instead prefer to appeal in populist fashion to voters \u2013 yesterday\u2019s \u201cbogus asylum seekers\u201d are today\u2019s migrants storming English beaches. Since 2007, the UK has been run by six regimes, five Tory and one Labour. But only one has obtained high office by winning a parliamentary majority at a general election \u2013 and David Cameron\u2019s mistakes provide an abject lesson of how power not only corrupts but also breeds folly. Being in command often causes a failure to think; the responsibility of power fades as it is exercised. Governments need to be constrained by facts. There ought to be detailed white papers setting out the consequences of departure, rather than a \u201cGet ready for Brexit\u201d information blitz. All misgovernment is contrary to self-interest in the long run, however much it might strengthen a regime temporarily. An election victory for a hard Brexit Tory party would come at a dismal cost to the country: not only would we perversely persist with a counter-productive and probably unworkable EU exit but we will be doomed to sterile enmity with our nearest friends and partners.",

Tony Blair\u2019s call for Labour to block an election \u2013 because Corbyn is too unpopular to win it \u2013 was unhelpful. True, Corbyn has plumbed unprecedented depths in the polls. True, Labour too has been captured by a separatist faction with its own slate. Consider this craziness: as Starmer, one of Labour\u2019s heaviest hitters, fights in parliament to stop a no-deal Brexit, his local party (also mine) is holding ward meetings to decide whether to reselect him. Corbyn should tell the NEC, the party\u2019s ruling body, to suspend all reselections immediately with the country in crisis and an election imminent. The country is in a volatile mood, so no one can predict an election outcome. All parties are vulnerable to sharp swings. If Johnson\u2019s pitch is that he will strike a rebranded May deal with the EU, he\u2019ll be eaten alive by Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party. If he pitches as a hard no-dealer, he may see off Farage but also moderate Tory voters \u2013 while he makes Labour\u2019s task easier. Corbyn\u2019s ambivalent Brexit stance has lost shedloads of Labour votes, but his campaign message would become crystal clear in simple opposition to a no-deal crash-out. If, as in 2017, Labour can shift the electoral turf on to the threadbare state of the country and its stricken services, then shadow chancellor John McDonnell\u2019s plans for breathing life back into a regenerated nation will always outshine the Tories. Sajid Javid\u2019s spending review, to be presented on Wednesday as a glorious end to austerity, will be punctured, barely touching the gaping need in every department. Johnson\u2019s sojourn in No 10 may be too short for new curtains. Note how the pound plummeted on news that he might go to the polls. With no majority, no mandate, and paralysed in parliament, he would be fighting a high-risk election out of necessity. For all the bragging, the threatening and bullying, for all the wizard powers claimed by his unhinged puppet-master Cummings, Johnson is forced to face the electorate too soon with nothing but hot-air promises. Go before Brexit and Farage eats up his votes. Go after a no deal, and project fear will have become a terrible project truth, with results for all to see. He is no surefire winner.",

      "bodyText": "Ahead of Wednesday\u2019s GDP figures, the government is in full expectations-management mode as the data leading up to the release suggests the weak economy and disparity in profit and wages growth remains in place. It\u2019s a pretty clear sign that a government is not expecting decent GDP figures when the prime minister is suggesting we should basically ignore them and wait for the ones to come out in three months\u2019 time. On Monday Scott Morrison said of the upcoming GDP figures that the government knew the economic situation was deteriorating when it handed down the budget in April and that it was done \u201cin the full knowledge that we would be facing a very difficult quarter, particularly in that June quarter, and I suspect the June quarter results will be soft\u201d. But he said, not to worry, \u201cthe June quarter, of course, does not include the second of the cash rate reductions from the RBA, nor does it include the tax cuts that came through ... So our view is we have got the plan, let\u2019s have a look at the September quarter results which will take into account obviously the first round impacts of what came out of the tax cuts and the cash rate cuts and then we\u2019ll go from there\u201d. That\u2019s all well and good, except of course the government was in charge for the five and a half years before the June quarter so it\u2019s a bit rich to say ignore that and wait for September when our plan starts working. And the problem is the news is not all that great. Yes, Morrison pointed to signs that house prices are again rising \u2013 which is good, I guess, if you are looking to sell your house. But if house prices did not begin to rise off the back of two interest rate cuts, then things would be pretty dire. The RBA, however, is very much hoping it is not just prices that go up. The Reserve Bank cuts rates to stimulate economic activity. And it sure as heck needs stimulating. The latest credit growth figures from the Reserve Bank, released on Friday, showed a jump in owner-occupier housing credit in July, but the annual growth figure remain weak, as does business credit \u2013 which fell below 4% annual growth for the first time since August last year: The latest building approvals figures out last week also showed the 20th consecutive month of falling private dwelling approvals: Mostly this follows a severe drop in the number of approvals for apartments and flats, but approvals for houses have been falling for 16 months now as well. The non-dwelling construction front is not showing much life either. The latest private new capital expenditure figures \u2013 which count investment on machinery and equipment, and building and structures \u2013 showed an overall fall in the June quarter, the fourth fall out of the past five quarters: Worryingly, while the falls in mining investment are to be expected, the fall in non-mining investment over the past six months reverses what had been a nice period of growth. The slightly good news is that the latest estimate for investment for 2019-20 shows a small improvement on the last financial year \u2013 including growth in mining investment for the first time in seven years: But that growth is yet to come, and will not be here in time to boost Wednesday\u2019s GDP figures. And while Morrison might suggest the current quarter we are in will show an improvement (you would bloody well hope so, given the cuts in interest rates and the tax cuts), the signs are not fantastic. The latest ANZ job advertisements survey, out yesterday, showed a 2.8% fall in August. As ANZ\u2019s head of Australian economics, David Plank, notes the drop is \u201cconsistent with other data, suggesting the outlook for the labour market is softening. In particular, the NAB survey points to slowing employment growth. The sharp downturn in building activity isn\u2019t likely to be helping either.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Also out yesterday was the latest Commonwealth Bank Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), which showed \u201ca further moderation in growth of Australia\u2019s manufacturing sector in August\u201d. The report notes that it reflects \u201ca weakening sales trend\u201d and a slowing of new work \u201cdespite rising export sales\u201d. It concludes that \u201csofter demand conditions saw firms cut back on purchasing activity, deplete inventories, as well as take on workers at a slower pace.\u201d So not great. The latest business indictors, out yesterday, showed corporate gross operating profits results were mixed \u2013 the mining industry continues to do very well but other industries such as manufacturing, real estate and finance are struggling: This is not great news given the standard link between profits and wages growth \u2013 a link which has been rather stretched of late. Over the past three years, total corporate profits grew on average by 15% each year, while the total amount of wages grew by just 4.4%: Even if we take the mining sector out of the equation, we see that for over two years profits growth has been increasing while total wages growth has slowed and now is stagnant: If profits are now looking to slow, that suggests any hope (such as it was) for better wages growth will disappear. The government might be waiting (and hoping) for better GDP figures in three months\u2019 time, but workers will be likely waiting for longer than that for any improvement in their wages. \u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

The AMA\u2019s landmark shift, delivered by a motion of the body\u2019s federal council, brings the organisation into line with forward-leaning positions taken by the American Medical Association, the British Medical Association and Doctors for the Environment Australia. The American Medical Association and the American College of Physicians recognised climate change as a health emergency in June 2019, and the British Medical Association the following month declared a climate emergency and committed to campaign for carbon neutrality by 2030. The World Health Organisation has recognised since 2015 that climate change is the greatest threat to global health in the 21st century, and argued the scientific evidence for that assessment is \u201coverwhelming\u201d. The AMA has recognised the health risks of climate change since 2004. Having now formally recognised that climate change is a health emergency, the peak organisation representing doctors in Australia is calling on the Morrison government to promote an active transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy; adopt mitigation targets within an Australian carbon budget; promote the health benefits of addressing climate change; and develop a national strategy for health and climate change.

Climate change will cause a higher incidence of mental ill-health. \u201cThese effects are already being observed internationally and in Australia.\u201d Bartone told Guardian Australia the motion adopted by the federal council had followed an ongoing discussion among stakeholders, and medical practitioners within the AMA membership. Health and medical groups, including Doctors for the Environment, the Climate and Health Alliance, the Royal Australian College of Physicians, and the Australian Medical Students\u2019 Association wrote an open letter to all political parties in April pointing out the \u201csignificant and profound impacts climate change has on the health of people and our health system\u201d. The AMA president said the decision to pass the motion followed on from those events both domestically and internationally, and was \u201cpretty much unanimous\u201d internally. \u201cI don\u2019t recall anyone speaking against it,\u201d he said. Asked whether the current government was pursuing ambitious enough policy action to combat the risks of climate change, whichthe Morrison government argues it is, Bartone said \u201cit\u2019s really difficult to say because this issue is clouded in conjecture and conflicting reports\u201d. He said all of the political groups in the Australian parliament had a responsibility to move past the toxic partisan politics that had characterised the debate and find durable solutions to a difficult public policy challenge. Bartone said the AMA would continue to assess the evidence about climate change as it emerged and update its stance to reflect the science. The latest official data released last week confirms that greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise in Australia. National emissions increased by 3.1m tonnes in the year to March to reach 538.9m tonnes, a 0.6% jump on the previous year. Emissions in Australia have increased every year since the Abbott government repealed a national carbon price after taking office in 2013.",

      "bodyText": "The Treasury will need to find an extra \u00a35bn from next year to fund the government\u2019s spending promises, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), which said the increase could undermine the Treasury\u2019s commitment to reduce borrowing. Boris Johnson said on Monday that Wednesday\u2019s Whitehall spending review, which will set out department funding for 2020/21, would be the \u201cmost ambitious spending round for more than a decade\u201d. The IFS said it was likely that pledges made in recent weeks to recruit 20,000 police officers and add \u00a32.6bn to the annual schools budget would need to be funded by large increases in borrowing if official forecasts were brought up to date and incorporated the recent slump in economic activity. Paul Johnson, the IFS director, said the government was taking risks by pushing ahead with spending commitments without updated guidance from its independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). \u201cMaking big fiscal announcements in a period of great economic uncertainty means we will have little idea how sustainable or costly decisions made this week will be. The risks are exacerbated by not having up-to-date forecasts from the OBR,\u201d he said. The warning echoes criticism last week from the Resolution Foundation, which said Sajid Javid was poised to break his first promise as chancellor by raising government borrowing above limits set in the Conservative manifesto. The foundation said the UK\u2019s international credibility would be tarnished if further spending commitments sent borrowing levels rocketing beyond the limit set by the Treasury of 2% of GDP, especially when it was already looking likely that the UK would leave the EU without a deal. Johnson said the government\u2019s pre-announced pledges amounted to a \u00a39bn boost for the government departments targeted for extra spending. However, up to \u00a34.5bn was already pencilled into the budgets affected, leaving the government to find \u00a35bn to meet its promises. In March the OBR estimated that public borrowing would be \u00a329bn this year before falling to \u00a319bn next year. \u201cBorrowing of \u00a319bn in 2020/21 would be \u00a327bn below the maximum \u00a346bn consistent with the government\u2019s fiscal rule which says borrowing should be below 2% of national income,\u201d said the IFS report. Around \u00a312bn of student loans will be added to the government\u2019s borrowing target, leaving just \u00a315bn of headroom for extra borrowing. Johnson said the next set of forecasts from the OBR, due later this year, were likely to reflect a deterioration in the outlook for the economy and public finances. \u201cThis could mean the chancellor\u2019s \u00a315bn of apparent headroom shrinks. He may claim that he is keeping planned borrowing next year within 2% of national income but new OBR figures due later this autumn could suggest otherwise.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Hurricane Dorian, the most powerful Atlantic cyclone in decades, turned its deadly sights towards the US mainland on Monday night after two days slamming the northern islands of the Bahamas with wind gusts above 200mph that have claimed at least five lives. Officials in Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas ordered millions of coastal residents to evacuate inland to safety ahead of the expected midweek arrival of the unpredictable monster storm. Strong winds were already battering the coast on Monday afternoon north of Miami, and Floridians on the eastern edge of the state are braced for risky tropical storm conditions from the early hours of Tuesday onwards even if the hurricane does not make landfall on the US mainland but passes within a few dozen miles. At a Monday morning press conference, Florida\u2019s governor, Ron DeSantis, warned residents of his state to \u201cremain vigilant\u201d and urged those in coastal evacuation zones from Palm Beach to the Georgia border to relocate inland. \u201cGet out now while you have time, while there\u2019s fuel available and you\u2019ll be safe on the roads,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have some impacts one way or the other. Hopefully by tonight we\u2019ll have a sense of [Dorian\u2019s] movement, and once we see the definitive movement north that\u2019s going to allow us to even more concisely identify the places along Florida\u2019s coast that are most at risk.\u201d Dorian has already left a trail of \u201cunprecedented destruction\u201d during its slow two-day crawl through Abaco Island and Grand Bahama, in the archipelago off Florida\u2019s south-east coast. With wind gusts above 200mph and a storm surge of more than 20ft, Dorian tore into the islands, destroying or severely damaging more than 13,000 homes, according to the Red Cross, and claiming at least one life, a seven-year-old boy who drowned in Abaco. \u201cBased on information out of Abaco, the devastation is unprecedented,\u201d Hubert Minnis, the Bahamas prime minister, said in a tweet. \u201cDorian remains an extremely dangerous storm. Our focus right now is rescue, recovery and prayer.\u201d Minnis said at least five people were known to have died, including a seven-year-old boy who drowned in Abaco. Residents in the Bahamas shared videos on social media showing scenes of catastrophic winds, torrential rain and flooding. There were also unconfirmed reports of bodies seen in Abaco that officials said first responders would investigate when conditions allowed. After parking itself over Grand Bahama for almost nine hours on Monday, Dorian was expected to pick up speed overnight and move north-west towards Florida\u2019s east coast, then turn north on a path closer to Georgia and the Carolinas by midweek. Despite weakening slightly to a category 4 storm on Monday, still with winds of 145mph, experts at the National Hurricane Center in Miami warned of \u201clife-threatening storm surges and dangerous hurricane force winds\u201d, even if the centre of Dorian follows its predicted path of remaining out at sea. \u201cAlthough the center of Dorian is forecast to move near, but parallel to, the Florida east coast, only a small deviation of the track toward the west would bring the core of the hurricane onshore,\u201d Daniel Brown, a senior hurricane expert at the NHC, said in a Monday evening advisory. \u201cThe hurricane is not a point and life-threatening storm surge and hurricane-force winds extend far from the center. Regardless of the exact forecast track, strong winds and a life-threatening storm surge are likely along the US east coast from Florida to the Carolinas.\u201d Experts have acknowledged that this storm\u2019s precise course has been more difficult than most to plot, partly due to quickly changing patterns of steering atmospheric ridges in the Atlantic. At 5pm on Monday, Dorian was still 105 miles east of West Palm Beach, home to Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort, and plodding slowly west at 1mph, with hurricane force winds extending 45 miles from its core. In South Carolina, Governor Henry McMaster announced the evacuation of eight coastal counties, affecting more than 800,000 residents, adding to earlier orders issued for large numbers of counties along the coasts of central and north Florida and Georgia. Evacuations in Florida included a number of hospitals and dozens of nursing homes and assisted living facilities along the coast. Orlando and Fort Lauderdale international airports were closed until further notice and rail services suspended. Dorian marked the fourth consecutive year that at least one Atlantic cyclone had reached category 5 status, denoting sustained winds topping 157mph, according to the NHC. Hurricane Matthew in 2016 followed a similar offshore track to Dorian\u2019s expected path yet still caused hundreds of billions of dollars of damage in the US and 47 deaths. In 2017 Irma and Maria ripped through the Caribbean, the latter blamed for more than 3,000 deaths in Puerto Rico. Last year\u2019s Hurricane Michael wrecked areas of the Florida Panhandle that are still struggling to recover. There is growing evidence that the climate crisis, through the warming of the atmosphere and higher sea temperatures, is contributing to a pattern of fiercer, more destructive hurricanes. Meanwhile, the UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence announced that the Royal Fleet Auxiliary support vessel Mounts Bay, which has been in Caribbean since June, would shortly arrive in the Bahamas to help with recovery efforts. The US Coastguard said it had rescue and recovery crews stationed on Andros Island ready to move in when conditions eased.",

      "body": "<p>The Trump Organization has promised to fund a new school and a health centre in order to win permission for a luxury housing estate near Donald Trump\u2019s Aberdeenshire golf resort.</p> <p>The local council\u2019s head of infrastructure, Stephen Archer, recommended councillors approve plans from Trump Golf Scotland to build 550 luxury homes and holiday villas in the first phase of a new development.</p> <p>Archer said the Trump Organization had agreed to part-fund a new health clinic in the town of Ellon, about eight miles (13km) away, plus a primary school and a new waste and recycling centre in nearby Balmedie.</p> <p>It has also pledged to build 150 affordable homes in later phases, in a change from the original plans. If Trump fails to construct affordable homes on the site, his company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/22/trump-organization-faces-5m-surcharge-over-luxury-housing-in-scotland\">faces a \u00a35m surcharge</a> to pay for them elsewhere.</p> <p>In a report to Formartine area committee, which meets on Tuesday to discuss the plans, Archer admitted the scheme broke the agreement Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/04/donald-trump-scottish-golf-course\">signed in 2008</a> to win permission for his \u00a3750m golf resort.</p> <p>But Archer said the new proposals came close enough to the original plans to justify council approval given the difficult economic climate.

      "bodyText": "The Trump Organization has promised to fund a new school and a health centre in order to win permission for a luxury housing estate near Donald Trump\u2019s Aberdeenshire golf resort. The local council\u2019s head of infrastructure, Stephen Archer, recommended councillors approve plans from Trump Golf Scotland to build 550 luxury homes and holiday villas in the first phase of a new development. Archer said the Trump Organization had agreed to part-fund a new health clinic in the town of Ellon, about eight miles (13km) away, plus a primary school and a new waste and recycling centre in nearby Balmedie. It has also pledged to build 150 affordable homes in later phases, in a change from the original plans. If Trump fails to construct affordable homes on the site, his company faces a \u00a35m surcharge to pay for them elsewhere. In a report to Formartine area committee, which meets on Tuesday to discuss the plans, Archer admitted the scheme broke the agreement Donald Trump signed in 2008 to win permission for his \u00a3750m golf resort. But Archer said the new proposals came close enough to the original plans to justify council approval given the difficult economic climate. He claimed the housing scheme, which will be expanded significantly in later phases, would support more than 500 jobs and put \u00a326m into the economy. Given the Trump Organization was pressing ahead with plans for a second 18-hole golf course and had made other concessions, Archer said: \u201cThe planning service considers the potential economic benefits of the proposed development to have considerable merit.\u201d His backing for the project substantially increases the chances it will be approved at a full meeting of Aberdeenshire council later in September, despite the proposals having received a record 2,900 letters of objection and 18,722 people signing a protest petition. Debra Storr, a planning consultant who vigorously opposed Trump\u2019s resort proposals when she was a Scottish Green party councillor in Aberdeenshire, described Archer\u2019s position as \u201cquite frankly, hogwash. I\u2019m not surprised the council has shown no backbone.\u201d She said Trump had only won approval to build luxury villas and timeshare flats in 2008 because they were needed to pay for the major golf resort he planned, which included a five-star hotel with 450 beds, shops, a clubhouse, conference centre and golf academy. None of these are being built. She said the original deal included money towards a local school and health centre, as well as affordable homes, but based on guarantees from Trump that the private homes would only be built once the whole resort was being developed. \u201cIf they develop the houses, there is no incentive to deliver the resort. It is the resort which was supposed to deliver the massive economic benefit which justified trashing the dunes protected by a site of special scientific interest,\u201d she said. Martin Ford, a Scottish Greens councillor who first blocked Trump\u2019s proposals in 2007, said Aberdeenshire would never have approved housing so far from public facilities or another settlement in any other circumstances. \u201cIt only ever got on to the radar as a justification for Trump\u2019s golf resort. So in the end, Trump gets to buy land for housing at agricultural land prices. If the council lets him away with that, they\u2019ve been a bunch of suckers,\u201d Ford said. The transport department is the only section of Aberdeenshire council to oppose the development. It said there were no safe walking routes to Balmedie or its school, and there was no easy way to improve safety for cyclists. The department said there was \u201ca high risk of non-delivery\u201d of the Trump Organization\u2019s \u201cvague\u201d promises to improve safety for walkers in the new estate and car usage would be much higher than the plans claimed. Archer\u2019s report argues the expansion of Trump\u2019s boutique hotel to include new bedrooms and the pledge to add 200 beds and 50 \u201cleisure units\u201d goes some way to meeting the promise in 2008 to provide a 450-bed luxury hotel.",

      "bodyText": "Barnacle geese are shifting their migratory patterns northward in response to global heating, new research has found, in a stark indication of how wildlife is being affected by the changes in climate. In their spring journey from the UK to their breeding grounds on Svalbard, one population of the geese has been forsaking a traditional feeding stop in Norway\u2019s Helgeland, south of the Arctic circle, in favour of a stop further north in Vester\u00e5len, far into the Arctic circle. The move has happened as spring has come earlier to the region. Over the period studied, from 1975 to 2017, the onset of grass growth in Vester\u00e5len has come sooner by about half a day each year, making a big difference in the availability of food for the birds. Significantly, younger birds have been quicker to make the switch. The study follows other research which has found bird species migrating earlier, land-based wildlife moving their habitats, and fish shifting polewards in response to climate change. This is the first to show migratory animals learning new routes, with individuals changing from old migration routes that they learned earlier in life in favour of the new routes, which are then transmitted to others \u2013 for instance, by offspring following their parents. The study, published in Global Change Biology, analysed 45 years of observations by the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research, the University of St Andrews in Scotland, the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, BirdLife Norway and the British Waterfowl and Wetlands Trust. In the case of these geese, the effects of the change appear to have been mostly benign, as the amount of digestible biomass available for them increased and the population studied roughly doubled in size in the past quarter century. However, the shift has opened them up to an unexpected new danger from climate change: predation from polar bears, which have started to rely on eating bird eggs now that the ice floes from which they used to hunt seals are disappearing. \u201c[The geese] have an amazing capacity to react to climate change, and actually adjusted very fast,\u201d said Thomas Oudman, of the school of biology at St Andrews, co-author of the study. \u201cThis was only possible because alternative feeding areas have become available, also because of climate change. For many other species, this might not be the case, [so] climate change might threaten their existence. Other migratory animals, particularly less social ones, may be less capable of finding and colonising newly available areas.\u201d Many other birds, for instance, have few or no viable alternative areas to visit, he noted, or may find it harder to transmit new routes to offspring. \u201cThere are many bird [species] that appear to be in trouble,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cThat\u2019s why we are trying to find out how birds develop their migratory behaviour, and how changes come about. We have found a clue in geese, showing that they can change routes during their life, especially young geese. But this change is probably speeded up by the fact that geese travel in groups.

      "bodyText": "The Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley wants to \u201celiminate a competitor\u201d by funding a lawsuit that could plunge Debenhams back into administration at the cost of thousands of jobs, the high court has heard. The struggling department store chain gained approval from its landlords for rent cuts through a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) earlier this year, keeping the company alive at the cost of 50 planned store closures. In April Debenhams published a list of the first 22 stores to close, which are expected to shut early next year, putting 1,200 job at risk. However, Sports Direct is funding an effort to overturn the CVA via the courts, in a legal challenge that raises the spectre of administration once again. At a court hearing on Monday, Debenhams\u2019 barrister, Tom Smith QC, said the retailer believed Sports Direct was backing the case because it \u201cwants to drive its principal competitor out of business\u201d. Smith told Mr Justice Norris that Sports Direct seemed to want to \u201cdrive Debenhams into administration so that it can pick up its assets on the cheap\u201d, adding that such an objective \u201cwould be consistent with Sports Direct\u2019s recent modus operandi\u201d. In written submissions, Smith said Sports Direct\u2019s role in funding the case was \u201chighly unusual and a matter of significant concern to the company\u201d. The CVA, which will result in some landlords\u2019 rents being reduced by between 35% and 50%, is being challenged by Combined Property Control Group (CPC), which is the landlord of six Debenhams stores in England. Ashley is providing the financial backing for CPC\u2019s claim. CPC argues that the CVA is \u201cdesigned to create a situation in which the company\u2019s general body of unsecured creditors is paid in full at the expense of certain landlords and local authorities\u201d. However, Smith submitted that Sports Direct \u201cis obviously doing this because it thinks it is in its own commercial interests to do so\u201d. He said that Sports Direct\u2019s conduct \u201cmay be borne of a desire to \u2018punish\u2019 the company [Debenhams] and its lenders\u201d for rejecting his effort to take control this year. Daniel Bayfield QC, representing the landlords, argued that the CVA was void as it \u201cgoes beyond the jurisdiction\u201d set out in the insolvency act and that it \u201cunfairly prejudices the interests of the applicants\u201d. He told the court that retail CVAs, which many other retailers have used to mend their finances amid tough conditions on the high street, were a \u201ccontroversial\u201d tactic. Bayfield said that most of the landlords applying to overturn the CVA held the properties \u201con trust for various charities. In those circumstances, [Sports Direct] has agreed to fund the legal fees of the applicants and to pay any adverse costs order made against the applicants.\u201d The CVA won 95% approval from landlords who voted on the proposed deal in May. But Mr Bayfield said those figures should be \u201ctreated with great caution\u201d as many of those who voted for it \u201cwere not affected by it, and who expect to be paid in full at the expense of the most impaired categories of landlords\u201d. In a statement before the hearing, a Debenhams spokesman said: \u201cWe remain extremely confident this challenge is without merit and expect it to fail. \u201cIn the meantime, we are progressing with our restructuring, which was approved by the vast majority of creditors, including 80% of landlords.\u201d Sports Direct did not return a request for comment.",

Her voice should come with a parental advisory sticker or an 18+ age rating. \u201cIt\u2019s Nigella in a dressing gown with a big spoon at midnight,\u201d Fisher laughs. \u201cI think people imagine a much sexier, thin person. And then they meet me and they\u2019re like: \u2018Oh.\u2019 There\u2019s a slight flicker of disappointment.\u201d</p> <p>Fisher is 44, with an open face and dark blond hair. On the street, you would probably peg her as a Boden mum \u2013 a bit posh, but jolly and direct.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been recognised on two occasions,\u201d she says. \u201cOne was early on. I was at Gatecrasher Festival, trying to work my way through a tent with my friends. This bloke did a really obvious double take and came up to me and tapped me on the shoulder. I thought, this is odd. He said: \u2018You\u2019re India Fisher, aren\u2019t you?\u2019 I replied: \u2018You\u2019re a Doctor Who fan, aren\u2019t you?\u2019\u201d She leans forward. \u201cThen, 10 years later, someone else came up to me on the street and said: \u2018You\u2019re India Fisher!\u2019 And I said: \u2018This is really odd \u2013 it\u2019s happened to me once before.\u2019 And he said: \u2018Yes, that was me.\u2019\u201d She hoots hysterically. \u201cMy fan club is made up of \u2026 one person!\u201d</p> <p>I put it to Fisher that her line of work is an unusual one \u2013 invisible yet also hyper-public. She nods. \u201cI am very grateful for the anonymity that voiceover work has given me. Because I can get the tube and live a normal life \u2013 unless I see my one fan.\u201d I tell her that I spent yesterday on hold with her \u2013 I bank with NatWest. \u201cOh no!\u201d she groans. \u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry.\u201d Fisher is so ubiquitous that sometimes she forgets her own voice. She will call NatWest and it will take \u201cthree or four goes of pressing a button to remember it\u2019s me.\u201d</p> <p>She never set out to be a voiceover artist \u2013 she wanted to be an actor. After studying English and drama at the University of Manchester, she got her break performing in the satirical show NewsRevue at the Edinburgh festival fringe \u2013 a Big Finish producer saw her, which led to her landing the Doctor Who gig. That led to Dead Ringers, and, through co-star Jan Ravens, her agent. \u201cShe got me MasterChef, so I have to thank Jan for everything. I didn\u2019t realise what voiceovers were then \u2013 I had no idea! MasterChef was the first voiceover audition I ever went for.\u201d She feels fortunate to have landed the job, but says the work of a voiceover artist is isolating. \u201cYou go along on your own, sit in a darkened, soundproof room, do your job and go home again. There\u2019s no Christmas party. It can be lonely.\u201d</p> <p>Her training as an actor proved invaluable. \u201cPeople say: \u2018How do you convey sadness?\u2019 Well, that\u2019s just how you act it. But if you\u2019re conveying running down a corridor, which you have to do a lot in Doctor Who, you pump your arms and run on the spot \u2026 It\u2019s more physical than people think it is.\u201d When it comes to commercial voiceovers, Fisher will be upbeat, because upbeat sells. \u201cIn order to do that, you smile. Smiling is a sure way of getting an upbeat tone to your voice.\u201d</p> <p>Narrating MasterChef since its 2004 reboot has given Fisher a unique view of the nation\u2019s eating habits. \u201cIn the early days, the people were good cooks, and their MasterChef journey was that they were taught to plate it up properly. Now, the amateurs come along and they plate as brilliantly as the professionals. It\u2019s extraordinary.\u201d She no longer has to define words such as velout\u00e9 or tian, because viewers know what they mean.</p> <p>\u201cI personally credit MasterChef with making us much more of a foodie nation.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"02e9eb9e927c6b519523ecc7dccd4902c6764c00\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/02e9eb9e927c6b519523ecc7dccd4902c6764c00/324_203_3745_2247/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Torode and Gregg Wallace: \u2018I personally credit MasterChef with making us much more of a foodie nation.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Torode and Gregg Wallace: \u2018I personally credit MasterChef with making us much more of a foodie nation.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Shine TV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What makes Fisher\u2019s voice so remarkable? \u201cOne of the most important properties is the breathiness,\u201d says Prof Yi Xu, an expert in speech sciences at University College London.

Being posh also helps. \u201cTo sound posh is to sound authoritative, and that\u2019s important for shows like MasterChef.\u201d</p> <p>Fisher and I are having lunch in a London cafe. I ask her to describe her salad for me, then immediately regret it, because she looks so uncomfortable. \u201cI don\u2019t know what this is,\u201d she stumbles. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing. I have scripts written for me.\u201d I beam at her expectantly. Her smile grows tight. \u201cPickled cabbage with an \u2026 edamame bean side and cos lettuce?\u201d Later, she confesses that she hates being asked to do the MasterChef voice on demand. \u201cPeople always say: \u2018Can you read the menu for me?\u2019 And I just say no.\u201d (She will make an exception if a friend is getting married and read their wedding menu.)</p> <p>I understand her reluctance. She is not a performing seal. And, in real life, Fisher sounds ordinary. If you expect her to lovingly roll her vowels like Scheherazade seducing a king in exchange for her life, you will be disappointed. Without a microphone a few inches from her face, Fisher sounds like a regular woman, having a chat.</p> <p>Before lunch, I had accompanied her to a recording for the upcoming 14th season of Celebrity MasterChef. \u201cThe first time I met you, it wasn\u2019t until you started speaking in the booth that I heard The Voice,\u201d remembers dubbing mixer James Whittlesea.</p> <p>They reminisce about their struggles to know how certain ingredients should be pronounced. Turmeric, for example. \u201cLike, is it tuh-ma-rick or tumour-ick?\u201d explains the series editor Katie Attwood. (The MasterChef received pronunciation is tuh-ma-rick, but every time Fisher says it, she can hear her mother tutting in her head, because she would say \u201ctumour-ick\u201d.) And don\u2019t get Fisher started on chorizo. \u201cIt started off as chorithoo, and then it went to chorit-zo, but I was very unhappy with that, because as far as I was concerned there was no \u2018t\u2019 in it,\u201d Fisher says. \u201cChorit-zo didn\u2019t last very long. I stamped my little foot at chorit-zo. And then John [Torode] started saying choritho and I said: \u2018Can we go with that?\u2019\u201d The other word that gives Fisher the most bother is \u2013 ironically \u2013 cuisine, which she struggles to pronounce. (She uses the word \u201ccookery\u201d instead.)</p> <p>Talk of chorizo and turmeric over, Fisher picks up her mug of tea and steps into the recording booth behind the sofa where I am sitting. Stirring music plays as an image of five celebrities walking over a bridge appears on the screen at the far end of the room. \u201cThese five celebrities are taking on the challenge to become the next MasterChef champion,\u201d booms a disembodied voice.

Most school leaders and teachers will welcome this change for outstanding schools. Many such schools retain judgments made though a previous inspection framework in a very different educational landscape.</p> <p>However, it is important that outstanding schools are treated fairly. Under current arrangements, good schools receive a section 8 inspection in the first instance. This type of inspection cannot change the grade.

      "bodyText": "In your report (Outstanding schools to lose exemption from Ofsted inspections, 1 September), Gavin Williamson claims he will leave no stone unturned in his drive to deliver great education for all children. Most school leaders and teachers will welcome this change for outstanding schools. Many such schools retain judgments made though a previous inspection framework in a very different educational landscape. However, it is important that outstanding schools are treated fairly. Under current arrangements, good schools receive a section 8 inspection in the first instance. This type of inspection cannot change the grade. Inspectors must explain why a grade change is needed and then allow the school 18 months to rectify any concerns before a full section 5 inspection. Outstanding schools must also be given this opportunity. The prospect of a grade change based on a single two-day inspection adds a huge amount of pressure for school leaders: 31% of headteachers who started in 2013 left the profession within three years. As a headteacher who has experienced a two-day inspection resulting in a \u201crequires improvement\u201d grade, I am sharply aware of how damaging it can be to the entire community. If Gavin Williamson is serious about delivering great education for all, he will work to ensure that Ofsted is a supportive process for schools rather than a system that contributes to the appalling waste of leadership talent we have seen in recent years.

Without an NI number or evidence of an address, it\u2019s difficult to prove they have lived here for the required five years Nannies and au pairs get \u201cpocket money\u201d, not pay, so are not required to have an NI number. Many people rent from rogue landlords, illegally subletting properties. They make the rent all inclusive, to avoid the danger of being found out if a tenant were to register for council tax or a utility bill. So, they often find it hard to prove residence. EU nationals are the bedrock of many core services and we need to make them feel welcomed \u2013 and settled.

      "body": "<p>In his five-decade career it would be fair to say that the engineer and industrialist Ferdinand Pi\u00ebch, who has died aged 82, was far more interested in getting results than making friends. A technically brilliant but socially awkward man, Pi\u00ebch was admired for his bullish achievements at Porsche, Audi and VW, but not widely loved, certainly not by the 40 or so executives he is thought to have sacked during his career when they failed to match his exacting standards.</p> <p>Nobody was permitted to make the same mistake twice. He ousted board members without blinking and eliminated whole layers of executives if he thought they were not performing. An engineer by training, Pi\u00ebch could not be blinded by science or excuses from his underlings. Obsessed with build quality, he once promised to sack a whole room full of engineers if they did not get the tight panel gaps he wanted on the latest Golf.</p> <p>His rule at VW engendered a climate of fear famously compared in the German press to North Korea, yet the results he achieved were there for all to see: as chief executive of the VW Group from 1993 to 2002, Pi\u00ebch grew it from a middling European car maker to a global mobility group building 10m cars per year and accruing $11bn dollars in profits.</p> <p>His contemporary Bob Lutz called him a \u201cbrilliant despot\u201d. Pi\u00ebch would not have been upset by that description and was well aware of his reputation. \u201cOnly when a company is in severe difficulties does it let in someone like me,\u201d he said in his autobiography. Shop floor workers may not take such a negative view of a boss who saved jobs by cutting the working week from five to four days and made VW Europe\u2019s largest car maker for the last 20 years and largest in the world, by sales, between 2016 and 2019.</p> <p>Pi\u00ebch was born in Vienna, into one of the great automotive dynasties, and grew up on a family estate near the city. He was the son of Louise (nee Porsche), the daughter of Ferdinand Porsche, designer of Hitler\u2019s Volkswagen, and Anton Pi\u00ebch. Anton, originally a lawyer, was manager of the new Wolfsburg factory in northern Germany where the \u201cpeople\u2019s car\u201d was built: one of Ferdinand\u2019s earliest memories was of riding on a train supplying Wolfsburg with raw materials and knowing instantly that he wanted to be an engineer working with cars.</p> <p>As a young child he could not have known the factory was mostly run on slave labour and, 50 years later, was sensitive to criticism of his family\u2019s complicity in Hitler\u2019s war machine, although both his parents were card-carrying Nazi party members.</p> <p>Ferdinand was 15 when his father died. His mother responded by packing the boy off to school in Switzerland. For his engineering degree at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, Pi\u00ebch wrote a paper on the development of the Formula 1 engine and in 1963 went to work for his uncle Ferry at the Porsche factory in Stuttgart in its engine-testing department. The now famous 911 was about to be introduced and it was Pi\u00ebch who developed its air-cooled flat six engine to maturity.</p> <p>By 1968 he was head of development and oversaw the creation of the 917 sports racing car, famously investing two thirds of the company budget in 25 of the 600bhp machines. These cars won virtually every event they entered and in many ways relaunched Porsche as a make that could go head to head with the most exotic Italian marques rather than being thought of as a niche oddity developed from the Beetle.</p> <p>His 1972 move to Audi was a result of internecine boardroom squabbles at Porsche that resulted in the company being launched on the German stock market with the proviso that no members of the battling Porsche family could hold management posts.</p> <p>Pi\u00ebch saw his departure from Stuttgart as a way of proving his talents outside the Porsche family. At Audi he became chief executive and went on to transform a range of worthy middle-class vehicles into a premium marque the equal of BMW and Mercedes Benz, mostly through technical innovations such as the Quattro four-wheel drive system, five-cylinder engines and fuel saving aerodynamic styling. He was closely involved at a technical level in all these developments.</p> <p>VW is said to have been three months from filing for bankruptcy when Pi\u00ebch joined it in 1993 with US annual sales down to just 62,000 cars; this in a territory where the firm had once been the leading import. His answer was to slash costs and then expand the range, the masterstroke being the implementation of a platform sharing modular strategy that reduced the number of common VW floor pans from 19 to four.</p> <p>His reinvented 1998 Beetle, based on the Golf, was a huge sales success and the following year Pi\u00ebch was voted \u201ccar executive of the century\u201d as he forged ahead, expanding the VW group into a 12-brand empire that embraced everything from Seat and \u0160koda to Bentley and Lamborghini \u2013 and a rebooted version of the Bugatti, the Veyron.</p> <p>Designed to his specific brief, this 1,000 horsepower super car will perhaps be seen as the pinnacle of his achievements by enthusiasts: Pi\u00ebch owned, and regularly used, two of them in a huge personal collection of cars. However, it was his preoccupation with ousting Toyota from the top of the world sales spot \u2013 with cars powered by \u201cclean\u201d turbo diesel technology \u2013 that had wider implications.</p> <p>The cars were fast, thrifty and bought in their millions but not quite as clean as they seemed. The \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/apr/15/former-head-of-volkswagen-could-face-10-years-in-prison\" title=\"\">dieselgate</a>\u201d scandal unfolded with the revelation that VW engineers had been skewing emissions results with engine-management software on 11m cars in a scam deliberately designed to trick the American emissions tests. This could have sowed the seeds of Pi\u00ebch\u2019s downfall, or at least left a stain on his legacy.</p> <p>Yet, as in all the other scandals VW faced during his tenure, Pi\u00ebch managed to sidestep any implication of personal involvement. Be it accusations of industrial espionage by General Motors or the 2005 story that VW was paying for \u201clust tours\u201d to sex clubs for its executives, none of the dirt stuck to Pi\u00ebch.</p> <p>At the last count dieselgate had cost VW $30bn yet Pi\u00ebch\u2019s departure from the board only months before the scandal broke has led some to speculate that he engineered his own demise by publicly distancing himself from his protege the chief executive <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/business/winterkorn-volkswagen-emissions-scandal.html\" title=\"\">Martin Winterkorn</a> while he was chair of the VW supervisory board, thus prompting them to vote him out in 2015. Even if Pi\u00ebch really did not know anything about the emissions fraud, it is widely believed that the high-pressure, failure-is-not-an-option environment he cultivated at VW laid the groundwork for the deception.</p> <p>Perhaps more than any other single individual, Pi\u00ebch maintained Europe\u2019s automotive technical leadership. He was not infallible, however, as the failure of his 2002 VW Phaeton, a curious overstatement of technical supremacy, seemed to prove. It was a swansong luxury saloon \u2013 almost a limousine \u2013 far removed from VW\u2019s everyman image, created at the behest of Pi\u00ebch to mark his departure as chief executive at the legally required aged of 65. Utterly competent, the car had a complete lack of charm, despite its technical superiority, and buyers were not persuaded: in the trade it was renamed the VW Fatal.</p> <p>Pi\u00ebch is survived by his second wife, Ursula (nee Plasser), whom he married in 1984, and their three children; by five children from his first marriage, to Corina von Planta, which ended in divorce; by two children from a relationship with Marlene Porsche (formerly married to his cousin); and by two children from another relationship.</p> <p> \u2022 Ferdinand Karl Pi\u00ebch, engineer and businessman, born 17 April 1937; died 25 August 2019</p>",

Pi\u00ebch is survived by his second wife, Ursula (nee Plasser), whom he married in 1984, and their three children; by five children from his first marriage, to Corina von Planta, which ended in divorce; by two children from a relationship with Marlene Porsche (formerly married to his cousin); and by two children from another relationship. \u2022 Ferdinand Karl Pi\u00ebch, engineer and businessman, born 17 April 1937; died 25 August 2019",

      "body": "<p>A former British agent who infiltrated the IRA says an internal police report has finally confirmed that he was targeted and shot by the group in a murder plot that he alleges was covered up by the government.</p> <p>The Guardian has seen a copy of a review by three forces into Northumbria police\u2019s investigation of the 1999 attempted murder of Martin McGartland.</p> <p>McGartland was recruited by the RUC special branch to infiltrate and undermine the Belfast IRA in the late 1980s. His exploits were later turned into the film Fifty Dead Men Walking starring Jim Sturgess and Ben Kingsley.</p> <p>The police document is a \u201cmajor crime unit investigation review\u201d by the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire forces.</p> <p>Its findings appear to support McGartland\u2019s claims over the past two decades that the IRA rather than a local north-eastern criminal gang was behind the murder attempt in Whitley Bay on 17 June 1999.</p> <p>In the days, weeks and months after McGartland was shot and seriously wounded, both Northumbria police and the then Labour government refused to confirm that the IRA was responsible.</p> <p>McGartland, along with unionist politicians at the time, alleged that the truth was covered up to keep the IRA and Sinn F\u00e9in wedded to the fledgling post Good Friday agreement peace process.</p> <p>In their review, the three constabularies led by Jon Boutcher, the ex-Bedfordshire chief constable and head of another multimillion investigation into another army spy in the IRA \u2013 Stake Knife \u2013 concluded that republican paramilitaries did try to kill McGartland.</p> <p>Among 60 recommendations to the Northumbria police regarding the McGartland shooting, the police forces suggest: \u201cThat Northumbria police must make a formal media release acknowledging the re-investigation of the attempted murder of Mr McGartland.

      "bodyText": "A former British agent who infiltrated the IRA says an internal police report has finally confirmed that he was targeted and shot by the group in a murder plot that he alleges was covered up by the government. The Guardian has seen a copy of a review by three forces into Northumbria police\u2019s investigation of the 1999 attempted murder of Martin McGartland. McGartland was recruited by the RUC special branch to infiltrate and undermine the Belfast IRA in the late 1980s. His exploits were later turned into the film Fifty Dead Men Walking starring Jim Sturgess and Ben Kingsley. The police document is a \u201cmajor crime unit investigation review\u201d by the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire forces. Its findings appear to support McGartland\u2019s claims over the past two decades that the IRA rather than a local north-eastern criminal gang was behind the murder attempt in Whitley Bay on 17 June 1999. In the days, weeks and months after McGartland was shot and seriously wounded, both Northumbria police and the then Labour government refused to confirm that the IRA was responsible. McGartland, along with unionist politicians at the time, alleged that the truth was covered up to keep the IRA and Sinn F\u00e9in wedded to the fledgling post Good Friday agreement peace process. In their review, the three constabularies led by Jon Boutcher, the ex-Bedfordshire chief constable and head of another multimillion investigation into another army spy in the IRA \u2013 Stake Knife \u2013 concluded that republican paramilitaries did try to kill McGartland. Among 60 recommendations to the Northumbria police regarding the McGartland shooting, the police forces suggest: \u201cThat Northumbria police must make a formal media release acknowledging the re-investigation of the attempted murder of Mr McGartland. This should be underpinned by a public statement that the original shooting was most likely associated with Mr McGartland\u2019s background within the IRA and having acted as an agent of the security services within the republican areas of Belfast and was carried out by a paramilitary active service unit.\u201d The report also dismisses any suggestion that the shooting was connected to a dispute between McGartland and drug dealers in north-east England. McGartland has always alleged that this line of inquiry was \u201cinvented and fed\u201d to media sources by either MI5 or elements of the Blair government to deflect from the IRA\u2019s role in the botched assassination. \u201cThe review has not uncovered any credible evidence of a specific threat to the victim at the hands of \u2018local criminals\u2019 or indeed that gives any indication of this being related to any of the victim\u2019s business, his work or his private life within the locality,\u201d the report says. In addition to calling for a fresh investigation into the 1999 attack on McGartland, the review suggests that \u201cNP (Northumbria police) to consider external force to progress investigation in its entirety\u201d. Furthermore, it recommends that \u201ckey roles\u201d in that fresh investigation \u201cshould be filled by persons not connected to NP (Northumbria police)\u201d. The report also appears to suggest that the IRA line of inquiry was known to the Northumbria police in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. \u201cMost critically, he (an officer named only as Police R by the review) was of the considered view that the attack was most likely carried out by the Provisional IRA and that this fact was known to the original SIO (senior investigations officer) within a very short timeframe following the attack. He (Police R) would offer no explanation as to why this had not been acknowledged much earlier within the investigation, and that this remained as a significant issue between the victim and the police,\u201d the report says. McGartland told the Guardian that this finding in particular proved that from the outset officers in Northumbria police knew that the IRA was behind the shooting. The ex-spy insisted this line was \u201ccovered up and obscured by false, malicious lies\u201d by senior figures in the security and political establishment to conceal the IRA\u2019s role at a delicate stage in the peace process. On the report\u2019s main findings, McGartland said: \u201cI am now urging the current chief constable of Northumbria police to immediately admit and acknowledge that the IRA had been behind my June 1999 attempted murder. I am also calling on him to swiftly agree to an external police force to carry out my unsolved attempted murder investigation.

On the wider implications of the report\u2019s findings, McGartland added: \u201cThe Northumbria police knew the IRA had been behind my shooting, that they acted in consort with MI5, the Home Office and the then Blair Labour government (and subsequent governments) covered it up to protect not only the IRA as an organisation but the individual IRA members who tried to murder me. And this was done as part of a secret deal between police, security service and government as a result of the Good Friday peace agreement.\u201d In 1999 McGartland was shot six times by two gunmen outside his home in Whitley Bay, North Tyneside. Eight years earlier the Belfast-born agent became the only person ever to escape from the IRA\u2019s notorious internal mole hunting unit, the so-called \u201cHeadhunters\u201d or \u201cNutting Squad\u201d. McGartland dived out of a third storey flat in west Belfast where the IRA were holding him before he was to be handed over to the head of the Provisionals\u2019 security team which was led by a man named Stake Knife, one of Britain\u2019s most important agents inside the republican terror group.",

      "bodyText": "A young academy player at a top European club who needs to shift some excess weight snaps a picture of his dinner and sends it to his fitness coach at the club. Back comes the reply: \u201cGood work but take some of the potatoes off and add some more broccoli. You\u2019re smashing it. Have a great evening.\u201d At another top club there is an academy player who doesn\u2019t think the meals at the club provide the right nutrition (he is right). He gets up early to make his own lunch, packs it up and takes it to training. The coaches routinely mock him, calling him the \u201cfucking packed lunch boy\u201d, and they encourage his fellow players to hide or take his lunchbox. He tops all of the club\u2019s fitness tests. The first player is now fully contracted and a standout performer, while the second had to battle against negative cultures right at the start of his career when he should have been in an environment that would inspire him. He has now left the game. Those two stories and many similar ones were at the forefront of my mind as I read Robert Kitson\u2019s brilliant interview with Kearnan Myall. These cases might sound unconnected to Rob\u2019s piece but they serve as an example of just how vital it is to provide an environment that gets the best out of those within it. Do that and the results will come as a ripple effect. Still, so many clubs in all sports don\u2019t get that right. They try but they get it only partially correct. Metres run, tackles made, kilograms squatted, calories consumed, hydration levels met, hours of opposition analysis logged. They will get every ounce of energy from a player to maximise those returns but what about their psychological safety? Not a sense of false safety, that your door is always open as head coach but if I don\u2019t like what I\u2019m hearing then there will be another door leading you to your exit. Not a coach high-fiving you down the corridor and sending you late-night messages telling you how much they value you after you put in a man\u2011of\u2011the\u2011match performance, then later that month ignoring you as you walk down that same corridor, because you missed a tackle in the last game.

These are the MPs expected to risk expulsion from their parties to back a bill mandating an extension to Brexit. David Gauke The former justice secretary told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Monday morning that government threats to deselect Conservative MPs who defy the party over the EU could actually boost rebel numbers. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s obviously a particularly confrontational approach, and I think designed to realign the Conservative party, to transform the Conservative party very much in the direction of a Brexit party.\u201d Philip Hammond A leading voice against a no-deal Brexit, the former chancellor said barring rebels from standing at the next election would be \u201cstaggeringly hypocritical\u201d of Boris Johnson. \u201cEight members of the current cabinet have defied the party whip this year,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cI want to honour our 2017 manifesto which promised a \u2018smooth and orderly\u2019 exit and a \u2018deep and special partnership\u2019 with the EU. Not an undemocratic no deal.\u201d Greg Clark Sacked by Boris Johnson from his cabinet role, the former business secretary was a vocal opponent of a no-deal Brexit during the Tory leadership race. He has continued to criticise the new government from the backbenches, saying of last week\u2019s prorogation announcement: \u201cParliament should be sitting more, not less, during the crucial weeks ahead, including during the conference recess.\u201d Rory Stewart Stewart resigned as international development secretary when Johnson became prime minister. The former Tory leadership candidate and MP for Penrith and the Border told Sky News on Sunday he was prepared to go against his party to stop a no-deal Brexit. \u201cI\u2019m a proud Conservative, I support the Conservative party.

The Orb Electrical Steels plant in Newport, south Wales, owned by a European subsidiary of the Indian conglomerate Tata, is to shut after 121 years of steelmaking. Tata will also close a service centre in Wolverhampton, which employs 26 people. The closures come after British Steel went into liquidation in May, but talks are continuing between the government and a division of the Turkish military pension fund Oyak over a rescue deal that could save more than 4,000 jobs. Tata Steel previously owned British Steel before selling it to the investment firm Greybull Capital for \u00a31 in 2016. Tata\u2019s European boss, Henrik Adam, said: \u201cI recognise how difficult this news will be for all those affected and we will work very hard to support them.\u201d The company said the closures had nothing to do with Brexit; competition from much larger players in China and Japan is understood to be the key reason.

Upgrading the site to meet customers\u2019 changing demands would have cost \u00a350m, Tata said. \u201cContinuing to fund substantial losses at Orb Electrical Steels is not sustainable at a time when the European steel industry is facing considerable challenges,\u201d said Adam.",

A further 640 LGBT Bangladeshis and 389 Nigerians had their claims on the same grounds refused during the period.</p> <p>In Pakistan, \u201ccarnal intercourse against the order of nature\u201d is punishable with life in prison, while <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/asia-and-the-pacific/pakistan/report-pakistan/\" title=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/asia-and-the-pacific/pakistan/report-pakistan/\">Amnesty reports</a> that \u201ctransgender people continued to suffer harassment and violent attacks\u201d there.

After Pakistan and Bangladesh, Nigeria produces the largest number of asylum claims based on sexual orientation.</p> <p>Using data from the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, the Lib Dems separated out countries where same-sex acts were criminalised. Applications for asylum on grounds of sexual orientation were also refused for nationals of Cameroon (136), Ghana (144), Iran (124) and Uganda (145) as well as Iraq, Jamaica and Malaysia.</p> <p>Christine Jardine, the Lib Dems\u2019 spokesperson for home affairs, said: \u201cThis Conservative government is letting down every LGBT+ person and every individual in this country who cares about human rights. We should be leading the campaign across the world against homophobia and transphobia. Instead we have a government that is turning its back and looking the other way.</p> <p>\u201cThese figures are a disturbing reminder that this Conservative government is failing to stand up for LGBT+ rights by refusing asylum to more than 1,000 people a year who face prosecution at home simply for who they are.

      "bodyText": "The UK Home Office has refused at least 3,100 asylum claims from lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) nationals from countries where consensual same-sex acts are criminalised. At least 1,197 LGBT Pakistanis were refused asylum after making a claim for protection on grounds of sexual orientation between 2016 and 2018, according to an analysis by the Liberal Democrats of figures published by the Home Office. A further 640 LGBT Bangladeshis and 389 Nigerians had their claims on the same grounds refused during the period. In Pakistan, \u201ccarnal intercourse against the order of nature\u201d is punishable with life in prison, while Amnesty reports that \u201ctransgender people continued to suffer harassment and violent attacks\u201d there. In Bangladesh, Amnesty reports that \u201cLGBTI activists continued to be routinely harassed and subject to arbitrary detention by state and non-state actors\u201d. In Nigeria, homosexual acts are punishable by up to 14 years in prison and displays of same-sex affection are also outlawed. After Pakistan and Bangladesh, Nigeria produces the largest number of asylum claims based on sexual orientation. Using data from the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, the Lib Dems separated out countries where same-sex acts were criminalised. Applications for asylum on grounds of sexual orientation were also refused for nationals of Cameroon (136), Ghana (144), Iran (124) and Uganda (145) as well as Iraq, Jamaica and Malaysia. Christine Jardine, the Lib Dems\u2019 spokesperson for home affairs, said: \u201cThis Conservative government is letting down every LGBT+ person and every individual in this country who cares about human rights. We should be leading the campaign across the world against homophobia and transphobia. Instead we have a government that is turning its back and looking the other way. \u201cThese figures are a disturbing reminder that this Conservative government is failing to stand up for LGBT+ rights by refusing asylum to more than 1,000 people a year who face prosecution at home simply for who they are. The Liberal Democrats demand better for LGBT+ people wherever they live. We will establish a new, dedicated unit to handle asylum claims, free of political interference and without the Home Office\u2019s culture of disbelief.\u201d In 2018, the Home Office refused 970 LGBT claims from nationals of countries where same-sex acts were criminalised, down from 1,096 in 2017 and 1,043 in 2016. Last year, LGBT asylum was brought into focus by the case of a Nigerian man who fled to Britain to avoid prosecution for being gay. Adeniyi Raji, who was sacked for his sexuality, received threats on social media in Nigeria, which included comments such as, \u201cI really wish you were killed that very day \u2026\u201d, \u201cYou know gay practice is an abomination in our land\u201d, and \u201cYou better stop your gay practice, if not you could get yourself killed in this country\u201d. The Home Office rejected his claim, which was upheld by the first-tier immigration tribunal. He is appealing against the decision but faces deportation. The challenges faced by LGBT asylum seekers were further highlighted by a case in which a first-tier immigration tribunal judge rejected the claim of a man because he did not have a gay \u201cdemeanour\u201d. The judge said he did not accept the man applying to stay in the UK was gay and contrasted his appearance with that of a witness who \u201cwore lipstick\u201d and had an \u201ceffeminate\u201d manner, who the judge accepted was gay. In July, the high court ordered the Home Office to help a woman eturn to Britain after she was refused asylum on grounds of sexuality and deported to Uganda. The judge on the case said it was \u201cprocedurally unfair\u201d. If the judgment stands, the woman would be the first deportee whose case was processed through fast-track rules operational between 2005 and 2015 to return to the UK and appeal against the decision to deport her. The ruling could encourage similar appeals from thousands of people whose asylum claims were treated under the same system. A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cIndividuals are only returned to their country of origin when the Home Office and courts deem it is safe to do so. \u201cEach case is considered on its individual merits against relevant case law and published country information, and all decisions on claims based on sexual orientation are reviewed by an experienced caseworker. \u201cThe UK has a proud record of providing protection to those fleeing persecution. Over 12 months, we gave protection to more than 18,500 people, the highest number since 2003.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The bosses of three of the UK\u2019s largest gambling companies have infuriated MPs by pulling out of a meeting at which they were due to face questions about their efforts to reduce the dangers of online betting, the Guardian has learned. The chief executives of William Hill, Flutter Entertainment \u2013 previously known as Paddy Power Betfair \u2013 and GVC, owner of Ladbrokes, had all confirmed plans to attend a session held in Westminster, only to send their excuses within days of each other. Carolyn Harris MP, who chairs the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on gambling harm, which arranged the session, said the withdrawals were \u201coutrageous\u201d. \u201cThese are men who run companies that feed addiction, amass vast profits from the vulnerable and take home huge pay packets, yet they are too afraid to appear before MPs. \u201cThey seem to think they have better things to do than to explain their actions publicly. They are running scared and their actions are cowardly in the extreme.\u201d The GVC chief executive, Kenny Alexander, was the first to withdraw, according to emails seen by the Guardian, pulling out two days after he was copied into an email to Harris from a compulsive gambler. The gambler urged MPs to quiz Alexander on claims that Ladbrokes Coral let him squander tens of thousands of pounds, despite him displaying signs of addiction. There is no suggestion that Alexander\u2019s decision to pull out was influenced by the email and a spokesperson cited \u201cbusiness commitments\u201d, adding that the GVC boss would attend a separate hearing at the House of Lords. Less than 24 hours after Alexander\u2019s withdrawal, William Hill\u2019s chief executive, Philip Bowcock, also sent his apologies, blaming \u201ccommitments around licensing in the UK and some shareholder meetings\u201d. William Hill will instead send Phil Walker, the group\u2019s managing director of online betting in the UK and Ireland. \u201cPhilip [Bowcock] has met privately with the group and individually with members and we will continue to engage with the group on an ongoing basis,\u201d said a spokesman. Flutter\u2019s chief executive, Peter Jackson, who had also agreed to attend, cancelled a week after Bowcock and Alexander, due to \u201cunforeseen travel\u201d. Dan Taylor, chief executive of European operations for the Paddy Power and Betfair brands, will attend in his stead. The former Conservative party leader Iain Duncan Smith said: \u201cAt a time when evidence shows that gambling companies have hounded problem gamblers to get them to carry on gambling, in contravention of their previous assurances, these CEOs now refuse to attend the APPG. \u201cTheir non-attendance speaks volumes about their complicity and they should be condemned for not being prepared to change their ways.\u201d The Guardian understands that Fred Done, chief executive of Betfred, will not be attending but had not accepted the invitation in the first place because of a prior engagement. Both SkyBet and Bet365 are expected to send their chief executives to the meeting, which takes place in Westminster on Wednesday.",

      "bodyText": "2 DEADLINE 2 DAY To make a half-decent sequel one must have a fundamental understanding of what prompted the demand for it in the first place, something which seems to have been lost on the makers behind such epic turkeys as Exorcist II: The Heretic, Jaws: The Revenge and Highlander II: The Quickening to name just three from a very long list of ill-advised follow-ups to movie classics made by numbskulls with no idea what made their predecessors so watchable in the first place. Of course, while it could reasonably be argued that the biannual production of Deadline Day on Sky Sports News is already two days of hysterical transfer chatter most right-thinking people could do without, the brains behind this weirdly popular circus clearly don\u2019t concur. To this end, the closure of the transfer window across Not The Premier League Or Championship is being lamely marketed on the network\u2019s website as Deadline Day 2. Eschewing the expensive production values that entail placing camera crews and reporters at training grounds the length and breadth of the country to check in on clubs doing last-minute business, they have instead focused on the cheaper option of scouring the newswires and Social Media Disgrace Twitter to keep us updated on which players are going where. Footballers like \u2026 \u2026 Arsenal\u2019s Henrikh Mkhitaryan, who has gone to Roma. \u2026 Inter forward Mauro Icardi, off for a loan at PSG. \u2026 Southampton\u2019s Mario Lemina, who might be going to Galatasaray. \u2026 Nasty Leeds\u2019s Laurens De Bock, who has gone to Sunderland. \u2026 Bournemouth\u2019s Asmir Begovic, who is going to Qarabag. \u2026 Nottingham Forest\u2019s Arvin Appiah, who is going to Almer\u00eda. \u2026 Liverpool\u2019s Bobby Duncan, who is going to Fiorentina. \u2026 Liverpool\u2019s Ryan Kent, who is going to the Pope\u2019s Newc O\u2019Rangers. \u2026 the Pope\u2019s Newc O\u2019Rangers\u2019 Graham Dorrans who might be going to Kilmarnock. \u2026 Chelsea\u2019s Kenedy, who is going to Getafe. \u2026 Manchester United\u2019s Matteo Darmian, who has gone to Parma. \u2026 Nottingham Forest\u2019s Liam Bridcutt, who is one of up to 20 players going to Bolton as the recently-rescued-from-oblivion League One side hastily try to assemble a squad so they are no longer forced to field a team of 12-year-olds. Much like Deadline Day, its sequel has thus far been largely underwhelming even if the tantalising prospect of some big-name cameos still remains. Will Neymar leave? Will Eriksen stay? After a summer of ill-informed but thoroughly entertaining nonsense, these and other questions will be definitively answered once the final scenes are filmed and we have a long overdue wrap.

      "body": "<p>It has been a highway, a sewer and was declared biologically dead in the 1950s but the River Thames is now a nursery for 138 baby seals, according to the first comprehensive count of pups.</p> <p>Scientists from <a href=\"https://www.zsl.org/\">ZSL</a> analysed photographs taken from a specially-chartered light aircraft to identify and count harbour seal pups, which rest on sandbanks and creeks around the Thames estuary, downstream from London, during the summer, shortly after they are born.</p> <p>\u201cWe were thrilled to count 138 pups born in a single season,\u201d said conservation biologist Thea Cox. \u201cThe seals would not be able to pup here at all without a reliable food source, so this demonstrates that the Thames ecosystem is thriving and shows just how far we have come since the river was declared biologically dead in the 1950s.\u201d</p> <p>The Thames is home to both grey seals and harbour seals, although only the latter breed there. The seals can feed on more than 120 species of fish in the river, including two species of shark, short-snouted seahorses and the European eel, which is critically endangered. Marine mammals spotted in the Thames include porpoises, dolphins and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/26/thames-beluga-whale-omen-changing-climate-gravesend\">\u201cBenny\u201d the beluga whale</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"90c169b832c443549c41064ad6c8a059921878fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90c169b832c443549c41064ad6c8a059921878fa/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A seal pup in the Thames estuary.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A seal pup in the Thames estuary. The Thames is home to both grey seals and harbour seals</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony Thomas/ZSL</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The river\u2019s seal population has risen steadily since ZSL began its annual count in 2013. The most recent results, from 2017, recorded 1,104 harbour seals and 2,406 grey seals across the estuary.</p> <p>It is not yet known if the numbers were due to resident seals having pups or adults moving in from other areas, such as eastern Scotland, where seal populations have been falling.</p> <p>Anna Cucknell, who leads ZSL\u2019s Thames conservation project, said: \u201cThe restored \u2018<a href=\"https://www.zsl.org/regions/uk-europe/thames-conservation/lets-protect-motherthames\">Mother Thames</a>\u2019 \u2013 as we call her \u2013 is an essential nursery habitat. Harbour seal pups can swim within hours of birth which means they are well adapted to grow up in tidal estuaries, like the Thames. By the time the tide comes in they can swim away on it. Grey seals, on the other hand, take longer to be comfortable in the water, so breed elsewhere and come to the Thames later to feed.\u201d</p> <p>While the harbour seals breed in the outer estuary, a swath of low-lying coastline between Felixstowe to the north and Goodwin Sands, off Kent, to the south, they forage right through London to Richmond, and can move beyond weirs in pursuit of food.</p> <p>Cucknell added: \u201cThe Thames is home to more than 20 fish species that use the Thames as a nursery habitat. Marine species such as sea bass and flounder use it right in the city \u2013 past the Houses of Parliament and up to Putney, before they head out to sea. Having a robust and healthy food web plays a huge part in supporting top predators such as seals.\u201d</p> <p>According to Cucknell, pollution including sewage is \u201cstill a challenge\u201d in the Thames. Poor plumbing in some housing developments still results in untreated sewage flowing into the Thames. ZSL is running a citizen science project called <a href=\"https://www.zsl.org/conservation/regions/uk-europe/londons-rivers\">Outfall Safaris</a>, in which volunteers walk along often-hidden tributaries and help trace the source of this sewage pollution.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c62b14263903747e3d9d4e316d21d881da513490\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c62b14263903747e3d9d4e316d21d881da513490/680_0_3758_2256/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richmond.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">While the harbour seals breed in the outer estuary, they forage right through London to Richmond, pictured.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A study found <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27697381\">up to 75% of flounder caught in the Thames </a><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27697381\">estuary ha</a><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27697381\">d micro-plastics in their stomachs</a>. \u201cWhat the knock-on effect of that is on larger predators such as seals is totally unknown at the moment,\u201d said Cucknell.</p> <p>The latest seal pup survey is from 2018. Scientists are still analysing thousands of photographs from the 2019 count. ZSL is also asking people to <a href=\"https://instantwild.zsl.org/projects/thames\">help count and monitor the Thames seal population</a> by logging on to its camera traps surveying different Thames-side \u201chaul-out\u201d sites, and recording what seal species they see there.</p> <p>Cucknell added: \u201cFor a long time, we had our back to the water and we haven\u2019t seen it as habitat, it\u2019s just been a waterway.

      "bodyText": "It has been a highway, a sewer and was declared biologically dead in the 1950s but the River Thames is now a nursery for 138 baby seals, according to the first comprehensive count of pups. Scientists from ZSL analysed photographs taken from a specially-chartered light aircraft to identify and count harbour seal pups, which rest on sandbanks and creeks around the Thames estuary, downstream from London, during the summer, shortly after they are born. \u201cWe were thrilled to count 138 pups born in a single season,\u201d said conservation biologist Thea Cox. \u201cThe seals would not be able to pup here at all without a reliable food source, so this demonstrates that the Thames ecosystem is thriving and shows just how far we have come since the river was declared biologically dead in the 1950s.\u201d The Thames is home to both grey seals and harbour seals, although only the latter breed there. The seals can feed on more than 120 species of fish in the river, including two species of shark, short-snouted seahorses and the European eel, which is critically endangered. Marine mammals spotted in the Thames include porpoises, dolphins and \u201cBenny\u201d the beluga whale. The river\u2019s seal population has risen steadily since ZSL began its annual count in 2013. The most recent results, from 2017, recorded 1,104 harbour seals and 2,406 grey seals across the estuary. It is not yet known if the numbers were due to resident seals having pups or adults moving in from other areas, such as eastern Scotland, where seal populations have been falling. Anna Cucknell, who leads ZSL\u2019s Thames conservation project, said: \u201cThe restored \u2018Mother Thames\u2019 \u2013 as we call her \u2013 is an essential nursery habitat. Harbour seal pups can swim within hours of birth which means they are well adapted to grow up in tidal estuaries, like the Thames. By the time the tide comes in they can swim away on it. Grey seals, on the other hand, take longer to be comfortable in the water, so breed elsewhere and come to the Thames later to feed.\u201d While the harbour seals breed in the outer estuary, a swath of low-lying coastline between Felixstowe to the north and Goodwin Sands, off Kent, to the south, they forage right through London to Richmond, and can move beyond weirs in pursuit of food. Cucknell added: \u201cThe Thames is home to more than 20 fish species that use the Thames as a nursery habitat. Marine species such as sea bass and flounder use it right in the city \u2013 past the Houses of Parliament and up to Putney, before they head out to sea. Having a robust and healthy food web plays a huge part in supporting top predators such as seals.\u201d According to Cucknell, pollution including sewage is \u201cstill a challenge\u201d in the Thames. Poor plumbing in some housing developments still results in untreated sewage flowing into the Thames. ZSL is running a citizen science project called Outfall Safaris, in which volunteers walk along often-hidden tributaries and help trace the source of this sewage pollution. A study found up to 75% of flounder caught in the Thames estuary had micro-plastics in their stomachs. \u201cWhat the knock-on effect of that is on larger predators such as seals is totally unknown at the moment,\u201d said Cucknell. The latest seal pup survey is from 2018. Scientists are still analysing thousands of photographs from the 2019 count. ZSL is also asking people to help count and monitor the Thames seal population by logging on to its camera traps surveying different Thames-side \u201chaul-out\u201d sites, and recording what seal species they see there. Cucknell added: \u201cFor a long time, we had our back to the water and we haven\u2019t seen it as habitat, it\u2019s just been a waterway. We\u2019re trying to change people\u2019s perceptions. We call it London\u2019s biggest wildlife secret. They see the brown water and think it is dirty and dead. We hope people will take inspiration from it, and ownership of it.\u201d The Thames: a brief history of brown The name of the longest river flowing entirely in England may derive from \u201ctamasa\u201d, a Sanskrit word meaning \u201cdark water\u201d. The Thames has always been brown, and will remain so even if one day it is entirely free of pollution. The brown waters are caused by eight-metre tides that scour its muddy estuary. They are the source of much of its biodiversity: allowing plankton to survive which feed off nutrients in the water column and provide food for fish. Sixty years ago, however, the Thames was toxic. \u201cThe tidal reaches of the Thames constitute a badly managed open sewer,\u201d the Guardian reported in 1959. \u201cNo oxygen is to be found in it for several miles above and below London Bridge.\u201d In 1957 the Natural History Museum declared the Thames to be biologically dead. The Victorian engineer Joseph Bazalgette\u2019s brilliant sewer system, which saved London from the \u201cgreat stink\u201d of 1858, had been damaged during the second world war. Parts had fallen into disrepair. Heavy industry used the Thames as its free waste disposal service. Not everyone was outraged. The Guardian reported in 1959 that a member of the House of Lords opined that cleaning the river was unnecessary: rivers were \u201cnatural channels for the disposal of waste\u201d and allowing them to break up our waste gave them \u201csomething to do\u201d. Repairs to the sewers and tighter regulations, including to reduce fertilisers and pesticides from farmland draining into rivers, gradually cleaned up the Thames, as did broader economic changes. The decline of Thames-side industry removed pollution; toxic metals have reduced since 2000, helped by the switch to digital photography, which has reduced the photographic industry\u2019s silver pollution. A time-traveller from the 1950s visiting the hides at the London Wetland Centre (created from disused reservoirs in Barnes) would scarcely believe the great white egrets, kingfishers, hobbies and dragonflies that are testimony to a new, enriched urban ecosystem. The Thames is more wildlife-friendly than it was, but it is not perfect. Salmon were reintroduced to the Thames, but this scheme seems to have failed. The inner Thames is too busy and noisy with boats for dolphins or porpoises to thrive (seals do not hunt using sound and so are more able to survive alongside water traffic). A species as rare as a tiger still snakes through the capital \u2013 the endangered European eel \u2013 but it is in drastic decline.

      "body": "<p>I do not drink the coffee in Starbucks because it doesn\u2019t taste good. But even if I did, I wouldn\u2019t, for another reason: my name. Because if you\u2019re a half-Turkish, half-Iranian second-generation immigrant like I am, it means you have a name that few can pronounce, and which even your parents can\u2019t agree how to spell. (My father spells it with a Sh, my mother with an \u015e. In their defence, they don\u2019t agree on much.)</p> <p>When your own parents can\u2019t agree on the spelling of your name, and beloved co-workers continue to get it wrong after years of gentle admonishing \u2013 well, I\u2019d rather not have to go through the rigmarole of painstakingly spelling it out to a barista. In the past, when ordering an iced caramel frappuccino from Starbucks (I am not proud of this drink choice, but there we are), the conversation has gone a lot like this: \u201cSirin ... No, S-I-R-I-N ... pronounced <em>Shirin</em>. No, not like Ed Sheeran. SIRIN.\u201d (Is presented with a cup with \u201cSharon\u201d written on it.) Which is why I have the utmost sympathy with the 25-year-old admin worker and Starbucks patron Nadia Khan.</p> <p>Last week, Khan ordered a cookies-and-cream frappuccino from the Feltham, west London branch of Starbucks and was asked \u2013 as is standard practice in outlets of the coffee chain \u2013 to give her name for the order. When her drink was brought to her with \u201cHippo\u201d scrawled in permanent marker across the side, Khan\u2019s mother went \u201cabsolutely ballistic\u201d, and confronted the employee. \u201cMum told him he should treat customers with respect, no matter how skinny, fat or whatever,\u201d Khan <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/starbucks-customers-fury-after-shes-19115053\" title=\"\">told the Daily Mirror</a>. Starbucks subsequently apologised, and said it would be \u201cworking closely with the store team to ensure it doesn\u2019t happen again\u201d.</p> <p>I wish Starbucks would rethink their naming policy. This isn\u2019t the first time name-related mishaps have occured. Social media is full of claims of Starbucks staff spelling people\u2019s names wrong \u2013 from the Philadelphia man who told workers his name was Aziz, but received a cup with \u201cIsis\u201d written on it (Starbucks apologised but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/01/niquel-johnson-starbucks-philadelphia-legal-action\" title=\"\">he is considering legal action</a>) to a woman called Ann-Louise who was given a cup with \u201cAnus\u201d <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/170503535867188118/?lp=true\" title=\"\">written on it</a>.</p> <p>If your name is unusual, or not of English origin, it\u2019s almost inevitable that it will be misspelled by your barista. It\u2019s exasperating to have to repeatedly spell it out front of a queue of people. Starbucks claims its policy helps it to \u201cconnect with customers\u201d, but grotesquely misnaming someone is more the sort of behaviour I expect from one-night stands.</p> <p>Ditch the names, Starbucks, and I\u2019ll be first through your doors. If you improve the coffee too, that is.</p>",

Because if you\u2019re a half-Turkish, half-Iranian second-generation immigrant like I am, it means you have a name that few can pronounce, and which even your parents can\u2019t agree how to spell. (My father spells it with a Sh, my mother with an \u015e. In their defence, they don\u2019t agree on much.) When your own parents can\u2019t agree on the spelling of your name, and beloved co-workers continue to get it wrong after years of gentle admonishing \u2013 well, I\u2019d rather not have to go through the rigmarole of painstakingly spelling it out to a barista. In the past, when ordering an iced caramel frappuccino from Starbucks (I am not proud of this drink choice, but there we are), the conversation has gone a lot like this: \u201cSirin ... No, S-I-R-I-N ... pronounced Shirin. No, not like Ed Sheeran. SIRIN.\u201d (Is presented with a cup with \u201cSharon\u201d written on it.) Which is why I have the utmost sympathy with the 25-year-old admin worker and Starbucks patron Nadia Khan. Last week, Khan ordered a cookies-and-cream frappuccino from the Feltham, west London branch of Starbucks and was asked \u2013 as is standard practice in outlets of the coffee chain \u2013 to give her name for the order. When her drink was brought to her with \u201cHippo\u201d scrawled in permanent marker across the side, Khan\u2019s mother went \u201cabsolutely ballistic\u201d, and confronted the employee. \u201cMum told him he should treat customers with respect, no matter how skinny, fat or whatever,\u201d Khan told the Daily Mirror. Starbucks subsequently apologised, and said it would be \u201cworking closely with the store team to ensure it doesn\u2019t happen again\u201d. I wish Starbucks would rethink their naming policy. This isn\u2019t the first time name-related mishaps have occured. Social media is full of claims of Starbucks staff spelling people\u2019s names wrong \u2013 from the Philadelphia man who told workers his name was Aziz, but received a cup with \u201cIsis\u201d written on it (Starbucks apologised but he is considering legal action) to a woman called Ann-Louise who was given a cup with \u201cAnus\u201d written on it. If your name is unusual, or not of English origin, it\u2019s almost inevitable that it will be misspelled by your barista. It\u2019s exasperating to have to repeatedly spell it out front of a queue of people. Starbucks claims its policy helps it to \u201cconnect with customers\u201d, but grotesquely misnaming someone is more the sort of behaviour I expect from one-night stands. Ditch the names, Starbucks, and I\u2019ll be first through your doors. If you improve the coffee too, that is.",

In the tunnel, waiting, Gaizka Garitano could hear it. \u201cThis is not any game,\u201d he said later, and if anyone knows that, he does. Growing up, he wanted to be a <em>bertsolari</em>, but he doubts that he really had the talent for it \u2013 these guys are the Messi and Ronaldo of verse, he says \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/apr/27/la-liga-eibar-press-conference-language-barrier-basque-almeria\">he became a footballer instead</a>. Born in Bilbao, he played in the Basque Country for Athletic, la Real, Eibar <em>and</em> Alav\u00e9s. Of his 16-year playing career, 14 were spent in Euskadi and he built a coaching career there too. He it was who took Eibar into <em>primera</em> for the first time ever and since December he has been manager of Athletic Club. What he has done at both is extraordinary; it is also fitting somehow, faithful to an identity which is his.</p> \n<p>There\u2019s something special <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/sep/17/spain-looks-north-as-real-sociedad-athletic-take-giants-to-the-wire\">about Basque football</a> and about this derby in particular, where the fans sit together and that was perhaps even more evident this week. Sometimes football is an expression of self, and this felt like one of those times \u2013 all the more so in the context of what has happened at Athletic over the nine months since Garitano took over, seeking survival. Like this wasn\u2019t just winning; this was <em>being</em>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVmGeILxd0\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vYVmGeILxd0?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The Basque Country makes up 1.4% of Spain\u2019s territory, 1.4% of its population and 20% of its top-flight football teams. Include Osasuna (which many do; the club name is Basque) and thus add Navarre (which is another step again in an uneasy debate), and it accounts for 3.6% of the territory, 6.2% of the population and <em>a quarter of all first division teams</em>. Most know about <a href=\"https://www.si.com/more-sports/2011/11/23/jonas\">Athletic\u2019s policy</a>, but it\u2019s not just them. In the build-up to this game, Athletic striker I\u00f1aki Williams was asked if he envied la Real\u2019s signings, which include Alexander Isak, Martin Odegaard, and Portu; no, he said, but they envy us having people \u201cfrom home\u201d. Yet until John Aldridge came, unwelcome at the start, <a href=\"http://www.espnfc.com/spanish-primera-division/15/blog/post/2345987/when-john-aldridge-returned-to-real-sociedad-he-got-a-heros-welcome-writes-sid-lowe\">celebrated at the end</a>, la Real had a similar approach; 15 of their squad have been in the youth system; and on Friday seven started \u2013 two in the Athletic side. Of the 22 starters, 15 were Basque (17 if you include two from Navarre), 11 had been in in the junior teams at Athletic or Real and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sidlowe/status/1167528139469328391?s=20\">both managers were Basque</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/02/union-berlin-rock-german-football-with-the-scalp-of-dortmund\">Union Berlin rock German football with the scalp of Dortmund | Andy Brassell</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The game was Basque too, very Athletic. And if there\u2019s an element of clich\u00e9 in that, there\u2019s also a significant element of truth. Garitano heard Jon finish, then sent his team out the way he does \u2013 roaring at their rivals, relentless. As El Diario Vasco put it: \u201cEvery time Real lost the ball, there was an ambush; every corner was a headache; every attempt to bring the ball out, they were suffocated; every challenge, a defeat.\u201d They were behind after 11 minutes: in his 122nd consecutive game, Williams swept in Ander Capa\u2019s ball after a neat one-two from a throw \u2013 Capa\u2019s third assist and the third time Athletic have scored via a throw. It was two on 28, Ra\u00fal Garc\u00eda looping a lovely shot beyond Miguel-\u00c1ngel Moy\u00e1, which is how it finished but it could have been more. Yuri Berchiche struck one, I\u00f1igo C\u00f3rdoba another as Athletic steamrollered Real, racking up 15 shots in a din enough to make ears bleed. Unable to live with it, built for a different game, la Real didn\u2019t have their first shot until the 84th minute.</p> \n<p>La Real had prepared for this, manager Imanol Alguacil said. But they could do nothing to stop it and could find no way out. There was escaping Athletic or the truth: his team had a goal ruled out by VAR, which also turned a penalty into a free-kick just outside the box, and their captain Asier Illaramendi was taken off injured, all moments that might have changed this, but Alguacil admitted that Athletic were \u201cbetter in everything\u201d; \u201cthey deserved to win,\u201d he said. His side looked cowed, \u201clike lambs before lions\u201d, Marca called them. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to nullify them the way we nullified them, because they\u2019re a very, very good team,\u201d Garitano said, \u201cbut Athletic imposed themselves \u2013 as we have done in the last few months.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>That \u201clast few months\u201d was not pulled from thin air. Before the game, Garitano had noted how his team had begun \u201coverwhelming opponents\u201d and they did it again. La Real were \u201cunrecognisable\u201d, one headline had it; Athletic, on the other hand, were \u201ca red and white cyclogenesis\u201d, said El Correo, and exactly the way they always are. Or are supposed to be.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/02/gonzalo-higuain-defining-figure-in-juventus-napoli-rivalry-serie-a-blog\">Gonzalo Higua\u00edn again the defining figure in Juventus-Napoli rivalry | Nicky Bandini</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>If there was a moment that defined this game, that defines them, rather than Williams\u2019s goal or Garc\u00eda celebrating his by signalling the wound on his leg; rather than the cheeky Capa skill that got a huge cheer, Yuri bombing up and down, or Iker Munian buzzing everywhere; rather than the way defenders look over their shoulder, terrified, every time Williams sets off; maybe it was the moment la Real broke. The pitch opened before them, but suddenly, Dani Garc\u00eda, whose mates are all Real fans, closed it again. Stepping out, alone, he won the tackle then stood there, arms wide, defiant, a gladiator in the ring. Are you not entertained?</p> \n<p>Oh, they were entertained all right, greeting him with a wall of sound. Football is this too, especially here. Afterwards, one Real Sociedad-supporting columnist called Athletic \u201cprimitive\u201d, insisting \u201cthere is no team that obtains more with less\u201d, whinging: \u201cHow boring!\u201d But he was wrong. Ask those fans what they thought. Or the headline that called Athletic \u201ca team to enjoy\u201d. Or Garitano, who described them as \u201c<em>alegre</em>\u201d \u2013 happy, open, fun. Better still, ask them what they want. Because, if Garitano also called them intense, a team based \u201cmore on the physical than the technical\u201d, a side that has to \u201csweat every point\u201d, that is also the way they are \u2013 and the way they\u2019re supposed to be.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s in our DNA, the way we are,\u201d Athletic\u2019s manager insisted. \u201cYou talk to me about style books, but I haven\u2019t read any of them. This is us. It\u2019s contagious. People at San Mam\u00e9s enjoy it; we have to transmit that to them, that effort. We can have a bad game but we always have to do that. The communion with the stands is very important. Historically we have a way of playing, values, and we have to express that every day.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/LaLigaEN/status/1167574390420250625\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Highlights as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Athletic_en?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Athletic_en</a> won the Basque derby to go \ud83d\udd1d of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/LaLigaSantander?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#LaLigaSantander</a>! <br><br>(Raul Garcia's goal at 0:33 \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31)<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AthleticRealSociedad?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#AthleticRealSociedad</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/Kpl263662E\">pic.twitter.com/Kpl263662E</a></p>\u2014 LaLiga (@LaLigaEN) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LaLigaEN/status/1167574390420250625?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 30, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>It works, too.

They had won just once in 14 games and were in the relegation zone; going down for the first time ever was a genuine possibility.

      "bodyText": "If the world is a football and players nomads what ties us to this dream, to this history? They were, we are, a long thread of feeling from those muddy fields to this stadium We are heirs of a culture, a way of being Listen once more to the heartbeat of San Mam\u00e9s Listen to the spirit of the fans Though we may not be the richest nor, probably, the best our greatest victory is to be who we are The poets set off at eight and went west along Pozas, which is the only way to head. As much a portal as a street, Pozas is narrow, noisy, tight with people, a pace and direction of its own. On either side, every other entrance is a bar, flags hung over doorways; at the end, the football stadium rises in the sunset, drawing you in irresistibly but without hurry as if there\u2019s no way out, nowhere else you could possibly go and nowhere else you would want to go either, especially not today. The Cathedral, they call it. And, as they were pulled towards San Mam\u00e9s on Friday night, through red-and-white shirts, through blue-and-white shirts too, Jon, Onintza, Xabi, Andoni, Maddalen and Amets occasionally stopped and broke into verse. When they did, crowds wearing both colours gathered to listen and laugh. The Basque derby means the bertso derbi too, sport as song and song as sport. Competitive, improvised street poetry: witty, incisive and theirs. The six bertsolari, three supporting Athletic Club, three supporting Real Sociedad, had paused to perform where Pozas crosses Mar\u00eda D\u00edaz de Haro street and momentarily opens up, and then again on a stage set in front of the new stadium on old ground. Standing where the original San Mam\u00e9s had stood for 99 years and where its spirit survives, they\u2019d done battle, words flying. Now, just before 10pm, two minutes before kick-off, Jon Maia and Maddalen Arzallus were on the pitch. \u201cIf the world is a football \u2026\u201d Jon began, \u201cour greatest victory is to be ourselves.\u201d When he lowered the mic, 47,697 people roared. In the tunnel, waiting, Gaizka Garitano could hear it. \u201cThis is not any game,\u201d he said later, and if anyone knows that, he does. Growing up, he wanted to be a bertsolari, but he doubts that he really had the talent for it \u2013 these guys are the Messi and Ronaldo of verse, he says \u2013 and he became a footballer instead. Born in Bilbao, he played in the Basque Country for Athletic, la Real, Eibar and Alav\u00e9s. Of his 16-year playing career, 14 were spent in Euskadi and he built a coaching career there too. He it was who took Eibar into primera for the first time ever and since December he has been manager of Athletic Club. What he has done at both is extraordinary; it is also fitting somehow, faithful to an identity which is his. There\u2019s something special about Basque football and about this derby in particular, where the fans sit together and that was perhaps even more evident this week. Sometimes football is an expression of self, and this felt like one of those times \u2013 all the more so in the context of what has happened at Athletic over the nine months since Garitano took over, seeking survival. Like this wasn\u2019t just winning; this was being. The Basque Country makes up 1.4% of Spain\u2019s territory, 1.4% of its population and 20% of its top-flight football teams. Include Osasuna (which many do; the club name is Basque) and thus add Navarre (which is another step again in an uneasy debate), and it accounts for 3.6% of the territory, 6.2% of the population and a quarter of all first division teams. Most know about Athletic\u2019s policy, but it\u2019s not just them. In the build-up to this game, Athletic striker I\u00f1aki Williams was asked if he envied la Real\u2019s signings, which include Alexander Isak, Martin Odegaard, and Portu; no, he said, but they envy us having people \u201cfrom home\u201d. Yet until John Aldridge came, unwelcome at the start, celebrated at the end, la Real had a similar approach; 15 of their squad have been in the youth system; and on Friday seven started \u2013 two in the Athletic side. Of the 22 starters, 15 were Basque (17 if you include two from Navarre), 11 had been in in the junior teams at Athletic or Real and both managers were Basque. The game was Basque too, very Athletic. And if there\u2019s an element of clich\u00e9 in that, there\u2019s also a significant element of truth. Garitano heard Jon finish, then sent his team out the way he does \u2013 roaring at their rivals, relentless. As El Diario Vasco put it: \u201cEvery time Real lost the ball, there was an ambush; every corner was a headache; every attempt to bring the ball out, they were suffocated; every challenge, a defeat.\u201d They were behind after 11 minutes: in his 122nd consecutive game, Williams swept in Ander Capa\u2019s ball after a neat one-two from a throw \u2013 Capa\u2019s third assist and the third time Athletic have scored via a throw. It was two on 28, Ra\u00fal Garc\u00eda looping a lovely shot beyond Miguel-\u00c1ngel Moy\u00e1, which is how it finished but it could have been more. Yuri Berchiche struck one, I\u00f1igo C\u00f3rdoba another as Athletic steamrollered Real, racking up 15 shots in a din enough to make ears bleed. Unable to live with it, built for a different game, la Real didn\u2019t have their first shot until the 84th minute. La Real had prepared for this, manager Imanol Alguacil said. But they could do nothing to stop it and could find no way out. There was escaping Athletic or the truth: his team had a goal ruled out by VAR, which also turned a penalty into a free-kick just outside the box, and their captain Asier Illaramendi was taken off injured, all moments that might have changed this, but Alguacil admitted that Athletic were \u201cbetter in everything\u201d; \u201cthey deserved to win,\u201d he said. His side looked cowed, \u201clike lambs before lions\u201d, Marca called them. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to nullify them the way we nullified them, because they\u2019re a very, very good team,\u201d Garitano said, \u201cbut Athletic imposed themselves \u2013 as we have done in the last few months.\u201d That \u201clast few months\u201d was not pulled from thin air. Before the game, Garitano had noted how his team had begun \u201coverwhelming opponents\u201d and they did it again. La Real were \u201cunrecognisable\u201d, one headline had it; Athletic, on the other hand, were \u201ca red and white cyclogenesis\u201d, said El Correo, and exactly the way they always are. Or are supposed to be. If there was a moment that defined this game, that defines them, rather than Williams\u2019s goal or Garc\u00eda celebrating his by signalling the wound on his leg; rather than the cheeky Capa skill that got a huge cheer, Yuri bombing up and down, or Iker Munian buzzing everywhere; rather than the way defenders look over their shoulder, terrified, every time Williams sets off; maybe it was the moment la Real broke. The pitch opened before them, but suddenly, Dani Garc\u00eda, whose mates are all Real fans, closed it again. Stepping out, alone, he won the tackle then stood there, arms wide, defiant, a gladiator in the ring. Are you not entertained? Oh, they were entertained all right, greeting him with a wall of sound. Football is this too, especially here. Afterwards, one Real Sociedad-supporting columnist called Athletic \u201cprimitive\u201d, insisting \u201cthere is no team that obtains more with less\u201d, whinging: \u201cHow boring!\u201d But he was wrong. Ask those fans what they thought. Or the headline that called Athletic \u201ca team to enjoy\u201d. Or Garitano, who described them as \u201calegre\u201d \u2013 happy, open, fun. Better still, ask them what they want. Because, if Garitano also called them intense, a team based \u201cmore on the physical than the technical\u201d, a side that has to \u201csweat every point\u201d, that is also the way they are \u2013 and the way they\u2019re supposed to be. \u201cIt\u2019s in our DNA, the way we are,\u201d Athletic\u2019s manager insisted. \u201cYou talk to me about style books, but I haven\u2019t read any of them. This is us. It\u2019s contagious. People at San Mam\u00e9s enjoy it; we have to transmit that to them, that effort. We can have a bad game but we always have to do that. The communion with the stands is very important. Historically we have a way of playing, values, and we have to express that every day.\u201d It works, too. In 2006, Angel Garitano arrived at Athletic as assistant coach on a rescue mission. They had won only once in 13 games and were in the relegation zone; going down for the first time ever was a genuine possibility. Twelve years later, his son Gaizka arrived at Athletic as coach. They had won just once in 14 games and were in the relegation zone; going down for the first time ever was a genuine possibility. Athletic were 18th but within a month they scored that penalty, from that run, and didn\u2019t lose for seven games. On the final day, they were a crossbar\u2019s width from a European place. They\u2019d climbed 10 places, winning 12 of 24 under Garitano and began this new season beating Barcelona, with Aritz Aduriz\u2019s absurd overhead kick. On Friday, they went on top. Two days later, Atl\u00e9tico overtook them but Athletic are still second. \u201cThis is something to enjoy,\u201d Williams said on Friday night. Athletic had gone 14 games without defeat at home \u2013 right back to the last time la Real came. Seven months on, they\u2019d beaten them back and had done it their way; they were who they are. \u201cI\u2019m glad the people are happy,\u201d Garitano said. \u201cThis is not any game; it\u2019s special, the most important night of the entire year.\u201d Talking points \u2022 It\u2019s good to have you back, El Sadar. Barcelona were bad, but it shouldn\u2019t only be about that; it should be about Osasuna too. They\u2019re still unbeaten at home, after a deserved 2-2 draw with Barcelona, Roberto Torres getting both, the first a lovely sidefooted volley. That\u2019s 27 games now without defeat there. \u201cAt times we bordered on perfection,\u201d said Osasuna coach Jagoba Arrasate. \u2022 Old enough to be his dad and all that. Well, this time it\u2019s true. On the same day that Ansu Fati became Barcelona\u2019s youngest goalscorer at 16 years 304 days \u2013 \u201c\u2019I said to myself, bloody hell, I\u2019ve scored\u2019,\u201d he admitted afterwards \u2013 Jorge Molina became Getafe\u2019s oldest goalscorer at 37 years and 131 days. And here\u2019s the even more amazing bit: Molina has scored 51 first division goals, 46 of them after turning 30. \u2022 Atl\u00e9tico Madrid were 2-0 down, the first time they had ever let in two goals in the opening 20 minutes under Diego Simeone. They changed formation twice, brought on three subs \u2013 two of whom scored and the other was a 19-year-old debutant \u2013 and came back to beat Eibar 3-2, getting the winner in the 90th minute, sending Simeone racing into the arms of Mono Burgos. They\u2019re the only team to have won all three games so far. Kieran Trippier, top. \u2022 The sooner Gareth Bale leaves the better? He scored two and saw two yellow cards (within seconds of each other in the 90th minute) as Madrid got a 2-2 draw at Villarreal. For the third year in a row. Mostly, they were really not that good. And it\u2019s hard to avoid the feeling they don\u2019t really know what to do about it, that this wasn\u2019t what they planned \u2013 something Bale\u2019s inclusion suggests.

      "body": "<p>The protest that took place last Wednesday evening, on the day the prime minister prorogued parliament, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/31/thousands-expected-to-join-protests-against-boris-johnson-coup\" title=\"\">part-organised by Another Europe is Possible</a>. I was on the conference-call planning it, and we argued about whether or not \u201ccoup\u201d was the right word, whether to start at 5pm or 6pm, whether to protest daily or concentrate on the Saturday. We talked about demo-fatigue and sound systems, the far right \u2013 who, inexplicably, were marched by police straight through the #StopTheCoup march at the weekend \u2013 but nobody argued about whether or not we should be protesting.</p> <p>The debate on our current crisis has concentrated on proroguing, but it is no more than the instrument of what has occurred: the executive has moved against the parliament. Not tricked it, outwitted it, bullied it, or won it round \u2013 moved explicitly against it. You cannot find precedent for this in the debates surrounding the Falklands war, or the national government of 1931; you\u2019re squarely on the territory of the English civil war. To watch it happen and accede to it with silence would be unpatriotic, an act of bad citizenship.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Political philosophy made the point decades ago that authoritarians love disorder</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Nevertheless, demonstrating leaves an uncomfortable sense of playing into the prime minister\u2019s hands \u2013 or more precisely, into those of Dominic Cummings (Johnson being hardly renowned for his over-arching game plan). Political philosophy made the point decades ago that authoritarians love disorder. It creates the spectacle of an unruly mob that legitimises acts of state violence. That could be symbolic \u2013 the development of a parallel narrative, in which pro-democracy protesters are seen as the lawbreakers for holding up traffic, exceeding the lawlessness of a government that overturns the rule of law. Or it could be a literal horse charge. Either way, the act of protesting opens up those possibilities. A completely supine population is difficult to characterise one way or the other \u2013 hard to demonise, impossible to kettle.</p> <p>Specifically, the rallying cries suit Johnson\u2019s argument so well he could have written them himself. I have no problem with the word \u201ccoup\u201d. It has been charged with overstatement: it plainly is not. That it is a fancy foreign word, such as you might expect from the metropolitan elite, I wouldn\u2019t think twice about; the relentless degradation of discourse \u2013 you\u2019re arguing, you\u2019re losing, experts are for losers \u2013 is part of the problem we\u2019re facing, and I will not submit to its principles. The main issue with \u201ccoup\u201d is that no hashtag spells it the same way twice.</p> <p>But \u201cno to no deal\u201d is a vexing double negative, since it leads inexorably to the idea that you\u2019d say \u201cyes to a deal\u201d. It is highly likely that this was the government\u2019s intention all along \u2013 that no deal improved their leverage all right, not with the EU but with British MPs. If they could amp up the perils, they could ultimately turn any objection to any new deal into an act of national sabotage. That\u2019s the point of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/01/get-ready-for-brexit-government-launches-information-blitz\" title=\"\">\u00a3100m advertising campaign</a>, which is deliberately low on detail and intentionally terrifying. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they\u2019d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/18/number-10-furious-leak-document-predicting-no-deal-brexit-shortages\" title=\"\">leaked the Operation Yellowhammer</a> no-deal planning document themselves, the vindictive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/30/sajid-javid-was-not-told-in-advance-of-advisers-sacking-by-cummings\" title=\"\">dismissal of Sajid Javid\u2019s aide</a> afterwards just an act of theatre. The only signal that this isn\u2019t the strategy is that Johnson doesn\u2019t seem to have the ghost of a plan for a deal.</p> <p>\u201cDefend democracy\u201d, meanwhile, allies demonstrators with MPs, in readiness for the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/28/boris-johnson-election-prorogue-parliament-populist-majority\" title=\"\">people versus parliament</a>\u201d election that is Johnson\u2019s chosen and safest territory. By the logic of his position \u2013 that the will of the people has been continually thwarted by the elites in Westminster \u2013 any defence of the rights of parliament becomes an argument in favour of those elites. Protesters are simultaneously a lawless rabble and the voice of the establishment. Having destroyed the Conservatives as a conservative party \u2013 pro-business, commonsense incrementalists \u2013 and now probably lost Scottish Tories, Johnson\u2019s only real prospect of power is as the leader of an English nationalist party. Ethno-nationalism sucks its rhetorical purpose from a hatred of the establishment, without which it\u2019s all bigotry and bunting.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/01/fresh-anti-prorogation-protests-planned-in-30-cities-and-towns\">Fresh anti-prorogation protests planned in 30 cities and towns</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is very different territory to the protests against the Iraq war, for instance, where there had been no build-up of assertions beforehand about who the real, authentic people of Britain were, and whether or not they wanted to go to war. We have now had three years of wrangling: bold-faced assertions that 52% is an \u201coverwhelming\u201d majority; that they all want the same thing, the most extreme version of that thing; and that members of that majority are the authentic voices of Britain, and their opponents, by extension, are just phoney, moneyed, unserious defenders of the status quo.</p> <p>It is a bind, and an inevitable one: the principles of democracy, that it is discursive, collaborative, pluralistic, have been under such sustained attack that any act of defending it can be portrayed as its opposite.</p> <p>And yet, inconveniently, no deal must be resisted, as it will cause, at the very least, hardship and hunger. Democracy must be protected, as the alternative is, at best, even for the most insulated, nihilism. Freedom of movement and the rights of EU citizens have to be fought for just for the simple expedient of being able to look your friends and neighbours in the face.</p> <p>The fundamental question of protest is not, \u201cWhat does it achieve?\u201d, as if there should be key performance indicators. Rather, \u201cWho are you if you do nothing? What solidarity are you not showing? What presumption of citizenly inertia are you building in to the metric?\u201d The calendar of events for this week, across the country, is at stopthecoup.org.uk.

Not tricked it, outwitted it, bullied it, or won it round \u2013 moved explicitly against it. You cannot find precedent for this in the debates surrounding the Falklands war, or the national government of 1931; you\u2019re squarely on the territory of the English civil war. To watch it happen and accede to it with silence would be unpatriotic, an act of bad citizenship. Nevertheless, demonstrating leaves an uncomfortable sense of playing into the prime minister\u2019s hands \u2013 or more precisely, into those of Dominic Cummings (Johnson being hardly renowned for his over-arching game plan). Political philosophy made the point decades ago that authoritarians love disorder. It creates the spectacle of an unruly mob that legitimises acts of state violence. That could be symbolic \u2013 the development of a parallel narrative, in which pro-democracy protesters are seen as the lawbreakers for holding up traffic, exceeding the lawlessness of a government that overturns the rule of law. Or it could be a literal horse charge. Either way, the act of protesting opens up those possibilities. A completely supine population is difficult to characterise one way or the other \u2013 hard to demonise, impossible to kettle. Specifically, the rallying cries suit Johnson\u2019s argument so well he could have written them himself. I have no problem with the word \u201ccoup\u201d. It has been charged with overstatement: it plainly is not. That it is a fancy foreign word, such as you might expect from the metropolitan elite, I wouldn\u2019t think twice about; the relentless degradation of discourse \u2013 you\u2019re arguing, you\u2019re losing, experts are for losers \u2013 is part of the problem we\u2019re facing, and I will not submit to its principles. The main issue with \u201ccoup\u201d is that no hashtag spells it the same way twice. But \u201cno to no deal\u201d is a vexing double negative, since it leads inexorably to the idea that you\u2019d say \u201cyes to a deal\u201d. It is highly likely that this was the government\u2019s intention all along \u2013 that no deal improved their leverage all right, not with the EU but with British MPs. If they could amp up the perils, they could ultimately turn any objection to any new deal into an act of national sabotage. That\u2019s the point of the \u00a3100m advertising campaign, which is deliberately low on detail and intentionally terrifying. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they\u2019d leaked the Operation Yellowhammer no-deal planning document themselves, the vindictive dismissal of Sajid Javid\u2019s aide afterwards just an act of theatre. The only signal that this isn\u2019t the strategy is that Johnson doesn\u2019t seem to have the ghost of a plan for a deal. \u201cDefend democracy\u201d, meanwhile, allies demonstrators with MPs, in readiness for the \u201cpeople versus parliament\u201d election that is Johnson\u2019s chosen and safest territory. By the logic of his position \u2013 that the will of the people has been continually thwarted by the elites in Westminster \u2013 any defence of the rights of parliament becomes an argument in favour of those elites. Protesters are simultaneously a lawless rabble and the voice of the establishment. Having destroyed the Conservatives as a conservative party \u2013 pro-business, commonsense incrementalists \u2013 and now probably lost Scottish Tories, Johnson\u2019s only real prospect of power is as the leader of an English nationalist party. Ethno-nationalism sucks its rhetorical purpose from a hatred of the establishment, without which it\u2019s all bigotry and bunting. This is very different territory to the protests against the Iraq war, for instance, where there had been no build-up of assertions beforehand about who the real, authentic people of Britain were, and whether or not they wanted to go to war. We have now had three years of wrangling: bold-faced assertions that 52% is an \u201coverwhelming\u201d majority; that they all want the same thing, the most extreme version of that thing; and that members of that majority are the authentic voices of Britain, and their opponents, by extension, are just phoney, moneyed, unserious defenders of the status quo. It is a bind, and an inevitable one: the principles of democracy, that it is discursive, collaborative, pluralistic, have been under such sustained attack that any act of defending it can be portrayed as its opposite. And yet, inconveniently, no deal must be resisted, as it will cause, at the very least, hardship and hunger. Democracy must be protected, as the alternative is, at best, even for the most insulated, nihilism. Freedom of movement and the rights of EU citizens have to be fought for just for the simple expedient of being able to look your friends and neighbours in the face. The fundamental question of protest is not, \u201cWhat does it achieve?\u201d, as if there should be key performance indicators. Rather, \u201cWho are you if you do nothing? What solidarity are you not showing? What presumption of citizenly inertia are you building in to the metric?\u201d The calendar of events for this week, across the country, is at stopthecoup.org.uk. Coup has no \u201ce\u201d. \u2022 Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist",

      "body": "<p>Serge Pizzorno is looking back at the rise of his band Kasabian and trying to pinpoint when it all became a bit too much.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d turn up at shows and there\u2019d be 20-odd trucks there, a catering team, loads of people everywhere,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd you\u2019d think, wow, this is actually a job for a lot of people, and it all rests on these four maniacs!\u201d</p> <p>This was in 2017: the band had just completed their sixth album, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/may/04/kasabian-for-crying-out-loud-album-review-indie\">For Crying Out Loud</a>, released to mixed reviews, and all was not well in camp. After 20 years together, Pizzorno was worried the band were getting stuck in a rut. And then there was the personal turmoil: not for songwriter Pizzorno, who had settled into family life in Leicester (he has two boys, Ennio and Lucio), but for Tom Meighan, the band\u2019s wild-eyed frontman.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I worried we would get stale. Sometimes you need to go down the rabbit hole to refresh things</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Mimicking their idols <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/aug/05/noel-gallagher-i-liked-my-mum-until-she-gave-birth-to-liam\">Noel and Liam Gallagher</a>, Pizzorno wrote the songs while Meighan brought the stage presence, preposterous quotes (\u201cOur songs sound like we\u2019ve shit ourselves 10,000 feet in the air\u201d) and ludicrous tales. Band legend had it that, whenever Meighan became too much to handle, the other members had to take him to the nearest Toys R Us store to calm him down. But following a split from his partner, the relentlessly upbeat singer was struggling. He cried in one interview at the time.</p> <p>\u201cTom\u2019s still figuring things out, but he\u2019s in a much better place now,\u201d says Pizzorno when we meet for coffee in London. But it\u2019s no wonder they needed time out. \u201cI was worried we would get stale. Sometimes you need to go down the rabbit hole to refresh things.\u201d</p> <p>The SLP is that rabbit hole. It\u2019s his initials \u2013 his full name is Sergio Lorenzo Pizzorno \u2013 and the name of his forthcoming solo album, recorded at his home studio, the Sergery (yes, really). With its guest appearances from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/mar/08/little-simz-grey-area-hip-hop-stillness-in-wonderland-mental-health-suffered\">Little Simz</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/may/11/slowthai-i-love-britain-great\">Slowthai</a>, and wild eclecticism, it\u2019s reminiscent of Gorillaz \u2013 a cartoonish world constructed as an escape from the pressures of being in an enormous band.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdpFz8EcYCU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DdpFz8EcYCU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>\u2018Ambitious in a minimal way\u2019 \u2026 the video for Nobody Else by the SLP</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Pizzorno sees it less as a new direction and more a return to the way he started off making music. Back then he was using an old Atari and a Midi keyboard; these days he\u2019s been recording on his phone, stealing snippets from 70s Italian horror movies, \u201cweird Polish shit\u201d, and whatever grabs his attention when he\u2019s out and about.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in Tokyo, hear the buzz of the electricity running through the pylons, and be like...\u201d he waves his phone in the air, as if frantically trying to record the sound. \u201cAll my mates will be taking the piss. And even in my own head I\u2019m thinking, \u2018I\u2019m never gonna use this.\u2019 But this time I did.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, the buzzing pylons make it into The Wu, an incredibly odd song about wandering through hotel corridors in search of the afterparty. It\u2019s a case study in Pizzorno\u2019s esoteric influences, from the <a href=\"https://soundwayrecords.bandcamp.com/album/heads-records-south-african-disco-dub-edits\">South African disco label Heads</a> and Lee \u201cScratch\u201d Perry to the late Nigerian synth wizard <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jan/18/who-was-william-onyeabor-nigerian-synthesizer-whiz\">William Onyeabor</a>. Elsewhere there\u2019s Mediterranean house (Nobody Else), mariachi meltdowns (Meanwhile \u2026 in the Welcome Break) and, in ((trance)), the kind of joyously anthemic track that wouldn\u2019t sound out of place in, well, a Kasabian set.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d87c306d5e525315699806d204d37845ce28d6b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d87c306d5e525315699806d204d37845ce28d6b2/124_0_2400_3000/800.jpg\" alt=\"Pizzorno performing with Kasabian at the Royal Albert Hall in 2018.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pizzorno performing with Kasabian at the Royal Albert Hall in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samir Hussein/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Did the rest of the band not think: can\u2019t we have a couple of these tunes? \u201cIt\u2019s probably testament to why we\u2019re still together that they didn\u2019t mind,\u201d says Pizzorno. \u201cTom understands that you need to explore what else is out there. Otherwise you become the band everyone expects you to be.\u201d</p> <p>The irony is that Kasabian have never been the band a lot of people think they are anyway. When they emerged in the early 00s, with electro-influenced rock anthems such as Clubfoot and LSF, they were stereotyped as lairy lad rockers, when in reality they were just as enamoured by hip-hop and acid house.</p> <p>\u201cOn our first record I would wanna sit people down and go, \u2018No, no, no \u2013 <em>this</em> is where we were fishing for that stuff, Can and Neu! or whoever. But whatever we said, the journalist would just ask us about the Happy Mondays. I soon realised it was best to just keep your mouth shut, because if you\u2019re still able to make albums and art, who cares where it comes from anyway?\u201d</p> <p>I interviewed the band a few times back then and always found them far kinder and more erudite than they were portrayed (\u201cOn the road carnage with rock\u2019s rowdiest band!\u201d screamed one NME cover line). But it\u2019s fair to say, with their wild tales and boasts, they played up to it.</p> <p>Was the lad thing a bit of an act? \u201cWe knew that journalists wanted it,\u201d says Pizzorno. \u201cBut at the same time, we did grow up where, if you wanted to be in a band, you had to have your wits about you. If you\u2019re playing in a village pub in Leicester in front of a load of lads that would throw darts at your head for having long hair, you can either go in and be all art school, or you can snap a snooker cue in half and say, \u2018Let\u2019s go!\u2019 But then I still wanted to get them in the corner and talk about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/nov/14/alejandro-jodorowosky-el-topo\">Jodorowsky</a> afterwards.\u201d</p> <p>Pizzorno\u2019s lad-rock credentials were no doubt enhanced by two televisual moments: a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXoQSqnLcaU\">goal on Soccer AM</a>, in which he improbably flicked the ball up in the air while wearing winklepickers before volleying it into a tiny hoop; and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Co0N2DB83-I\">an even better strike</a> during the Soccer Aid charity match that saw him scoop the ball over former England keeper David Seaman\u2019s head and into the top corner of the net. The mention of these acts of sporting glory makes Pizzorno groan: \u201cYou\u2019ll work for ages on a piece of music or art that you\u2019re really proud of. But kick a ball through a hole in an inflatable bouncy castle and it\u2019s what you become known for.\u201d</p> <p>Come on though, which was his favourite goal? \u201cWith the Soccer AM one I\u2019d been up all night, I was hanging. If I was sober I\u2019d never have even tried it. But the [Soccer Aid] one \u2026 not only is it a great goal, but for five minutes after scoring it, I\u2019ve never been more off my nut in my life. As a pure sledgehammer hit of adrenaline, it was insane. God knows what it would be like to score in a World Cup.\u201d</p> <p>Less impressive when it comes to lad stereotypes was a cover of Q magazine, on which Meighan and Pizzorno appeared alongside two naked ladies, something that even back in 2011 looked like a relic of a bygone era. Pizzorno groans again, but this time he means it. \u201cThat really kills me,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was sold to us as Jimi Hendrix, Electric Ladyland, a celebration of 60s psychedelia. But we learned an important lesson there \u2013 we need to take control over every element.\u201d</p> <p>Pizzorno says the band have always been more inclusive than people give them credit for. \u201cArt can be the start of something. At [Kasabian\u2019s] gigs you only have to look at the first few rows to see there\u2019s people from all over the world, with completely different views on how things should be done, but at least we\u2019ve got them together.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e4c6cc21e264af8cd66fcc011761f33ec602bc14\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4c6cc21e264af8cd66fcc011761f33ec602bc14/0_0_3902_2733/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kasabian (from left, Chris Edwards, Ian Matthews, Pizzorno and Tom Meighan) on tour in 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"700\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It all rests on these four maniacs\u2019 \u2026 Kasabian (from left, Chris Edwards, Ian Matthews, Pizzorno and Tom Meighan) on tour in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s a song on The SLP that addresses this, the final track Meanwhile \u2026 in the Silent Nowhere. \u201cIt\u2019s about communication,\u201d says Pizzorno. \u201cPreviously, even if you were rightwing or had extreme views, it felt like there could be some sort of dialogue where you could at least hear each other\u2019s stories. Now it feels like, \u2018This is my belief, fuck you\u2019 ... there\u2019s a danger in us not sitting down and talking face to face.\u201d</p> <p>What does he think of the current political situation? \u201cIt\u2019s like Vegas. Fundamentally, the system is rigged and whatever you implement, the outcome will be the same. You\u2019re probably talking revolution here but we need someone to come along and start again.\u201d Is Jeremy Corbyn that person? \u201cHe\u2019s the best shot we\u2019ve got ... but I think there\u2019s more. There\u2019s someone else out there that can marry spirituality [with politics] and break the system and get us to start again somewhere better.\u201d He laughs: \u201cI think I\u2019m just waiting for the messiah.\u201d</p> <p>Right now, Pizzorno has more pressing problems than the overthrow of capitalism: how to be a musician without Meighan by his side. He\u2019s planned an impressive stage show, with different characters performing each song.

      "bodyText": "Serge Pizzorno is looking back at the rise of his band Kasabian and trying to pinpoint when it all became a bit too much. \u201cYou\u2019d turn up at shows and there\u2019d be 20-odd trucks there, a catering team, loads of people everywhere,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd you\u2019d think, wow, this is actually a job for a lot of people, and it all rests on these four maniacs!\u201d This was in 2017: the band had just completed their sixth album, For Crying Out Loud, released to mixed reviews, and all was not well in camp. After 20 years together, Pizzorno was worried the band were getting stuck in a rut. And then there was the personal turmoil: not for songwriter Pizzorno, who had settled into family life in Leicester (he has two boys, Ennio and Lucio), but for Tom Meighan, the band\u2019s wild-eyed frontman. Mimicking their idols Noel and Liam Gallagher, Pizzorno wrote the songs while Meighan brought the stage presence, preposterous quotes (\u201cOur songs sound like we\u2019ve shit ourselves 10,000 feet in the air\u201d) and ludicrous tales. Band legend had it that, whenever Meighan became too much to handle, the other members had to take him to the nearest Toys R Us store to calm him down. But following a split from his partner, the relentlessly upbeat singer was struggling. He cried in one interview at the time. \u201cTom\u2019s still figuring things out, but he\u2019s in a much better place now,\u201d says Pizzorno when we meet for coffee in London. But it\u2019s no wonder they needed time out. \u201cI was worried we would get stale. Sometimes you need to go down the rabbit hole to refresh things.\u201d The SLP is that rabbit hole. It\u2019s his initials \u2013 his full name is Sergio Lorenzo Pizzorno \u2013 and the name of his forthcoming solo album, recorded at his home studio, the Sergery (yes, really). With its guest appearances from Little Simz and Slowthai, and wild eclecticism, it\u2019s reminiscent of Gorillaz \u2013 a cartoonish world constructed as an escape from the pressures of being in an enormous band. Pizzorno sees it less as a new direction and more a return to the way he started off making music. Back then he was using an old Atari and a Midi keyboard; these days he\u2019s been recording on his phone, stealing snippets from 70s Italian horror movies, \u201cweird Polish shit\u201d, and whatever grabs his attention when he\u2019s out and about. \u201cI\u2019ll be in Tokyo, hear the buzz of the electricity running through the pylons, and be like...\u201d he waves his phone in the air, as if frantically trying to record the sound. \u201cAll my mates will be taking the piss. And even in my own head I\u2019m thinking, \u2018I\u2019m never gonna use this.\u2019 But this time I did.\u201d Indeed, the buzzing pylons make it into The Wu, an incredibly odd song about wandering through hotel corridors in search of the afterparty. It\u2019s a case study in Pizzorno\u2019s esoteric influences, from the South African disco label Heads and Lee \u201cScratch\u201d Perry to the late Nigerian synth wizard William Onyeabor. Elsewhere there\u2019s Mediterranean house (Nobody Else), mariachi meltdowns (Meanwhile \u2026 in the Welcome Break) and, in ((trance)), the kind of joyously anthemic track that wouldn\u2019t sound out of place in, well, a Kasabian set. Did the rest of the band not think: can\u2019t we have a couple of these tunes? \u201cIt\u2019s probably testament to why we\u2019re still together that they didn\u2019t mind,\u201d says Pizzorno. \u201cTom understands that you need to explore what else is out there. Otherwise you become the band everyone expects you to be.\u201d The irony is that Kasabian have never been the band a lot of people think they are anyway. When they emerged in the early 00s, with electro-influenced rock anthems such as Clubfoot and LSF, they were stereotyped as lairy lad rockers, when in reality they were just as enamoured by hip-hop and acid house. \u201cOn our first record I would wanna sit people down and go, \u2018No, no, no \u2013 this is where we were fishing for that stuff, Can and Neu! or whoever. But whatever we said, the journalist would just ask us about the Happy Mondays. I soon realised it was best to just keep your mouth shut, because if you\u2019re still able to make albums and art, who cares where it comes from anyway?\u201d I interviewed the band a few times back then and always found them far kinder and more erudite than they were portrayed (\u201cOn the road carnage with rock\u2019s rowdiest band!\u201d screamed one NME cover line). But it\u2019s fair to say, with their wild tales and boasts, they played up to it. Was the lad thing a bit of an act? \u201cWe knew that journalists wanted it,\u201d says Pizzorno. \u201cBut at the same time, we did grow up where, if you wanted to be in a band, you had to have your wits about you. If you\u2019re playing in a village pub in Leicester in front of a load of lads that would throw darts at your head for having long hair, you can either go in and be all art school, or you can snap a snooker cue in half and say, \u2018Let\u2019s go!\u2019 But then I still wanted to get them in the corner and talk about Jodorowsky afterwards.\u201d Pizzorno\u2019s lad-rock credentials were no doubt enhanced by two televisual moments: a goal on Soccer AM, in which he improbably flicked the ball up in the air while wearing winklepickers before volleying it into a tiny hoop; and an even better strike during the Soccer Aid charity match that saw him scoop the ball over former England keeper David Seaman\u2019s head and into the top corner of the net. The mention of these acts of sporting glory makes Pizzorno groan: \u201cYou\u2019ll work for ages on a piece of music or art that you\u2019re really proud of. But kick a ball through a hole in an inflatable bouncy castle and it\u2019s what you become known for.\u201d Come on though, which was his favourite goal? \u201cWith the Soccer AM one I\u2019d been up all night, I was hanging. If I was sober I\u2019d never have even tried it. But the [Soccer Aid] one \u2026 not only is it a great goal, but for five minutes after scoring it, I\u2019ve never been more off my nut in my life. As a pure sledgehammer hit of adrenaline, it was insane. God knows what it would be like to score in a World Cup.\u201d Less impressive when it comes to lad stereotypes was a cover of Q magazine, on which Meighan and Pizzorno appeared alongside two naked ladies, something that even back in 2011 looked like a relic of a bygone era. Pizzorno groans again, but this time he means it. \u201cThat really kills me,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was sold to us as Jimi Hendrix, Electric Ladyland, a celebration of 60s psychedelia. But we learned an important lesson there \u2013 we need to take control over every element.\u201d Pizzorno says the band have always been more inclusive than people give them credit for. \u201cArt can be the start of something. At [Kasabian\u2019s] gigs you only have to look at the first few rows to see there\u2019s people from all over the world, with completely different views on how things should be done, but at least we\u2019ve got them together.\u201d There\u2019s a song on The SLP that addresses this, the final track Meanwhile \u2026 in the Silent Nowhere. \u201cIt\u2019s about communication,\u201d says Pizzorno. \u201cPreviously, even if you were rightwing or had extreme views, it felt like there could be some sort of dialogue where you could at least hear each other\u2019s stories. Now it feels like, \u2018This is my belief, fuck you\u2019 ... there\u2019s a danger in us not sitting down and talking face to face.\u201d What does he think of the current political situation? \u201cIt\u2019s like Vegas. Fundamentally, the system is rigged and whatever you implement, the outcome will be the same. You\u2019re probably talking revolution here but we need someone to come along and start again.\u201d Is Jeremy Corbyn that person? \u201cHe\u2019s the best shot we\u2019ve got ... but I think there\u2019s more. There\u2019s someone else out there that can marry spirituality [with politics] and break the system and get us to start again somewhere better.\u201d He laughs: \u201cI think I\u2019m just waiting for the messiah.\u201d Right now, Pizzorno has more pressing problems than the overthrow of capitalism: how to be a musician without Meighan by his side. He\u2019s planned an impressive stage show, with different characters performing each song. It sounds ambitious. \u201cBut in a really minimal way,\u201d he stresses. \u201cNot overblown, the opposite to lasers and screens. It won\u2019t be pretentious. Pretentious is my number one fear.\u201d Will there be costume changes? \u201cVery subtle ones. There might be a hat. I might be barefoot. Fundamentally, I want it to be like a David Lynch thing, where people feel on edge, as if they\u2019ve entered another world for 50 minutes.\u201d Pizzorno says he knows he can never compete with Kasabian\u2019s enormous gigs \u2013 those gigantic, truck-bearing affairs with catering teams and staff everywhere. \u201cBut the aim is to get to that same euphoric point,\u201d he says, \u201cjust in a whole new way.\u201d The SLP is out now.

On Sunday, Gove, who is in charge of no-deal Brexit preparations, ignited the row by declining to rule out the idea that the government could ignore such a law. \u201cLet\u2019s see what the legislation says,\u201d he told BBC One\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show. On Gove\u2019s comments, the No 10 spokesman said: \u201cI think he was very clear with the point he was making, which was that we haven\u2019t seen any legislation yet and that the government will need to look at any legislation brought forward to establish what it does or doesn\u2019t require.\u201d Pressed on this, he said: \u201cIn relation to this specific point, we\u2019re going to have to look at the legislation which is brought forward. We haven\u2019t seen what\u2019s been put forward yet. The people who are promoting it have not been willing to share that.\u201d The spokesman denied Gove\u2019s comments amounted to a \u201cpick-and-choose\u201d approach to abiding by the law. \u201cHe was simply saying in relation to this particular piece of legislation that we haven\u2019t seen it yet,\u201d he said. A Downing Street source later sought to play down the significance of what Gove said, saying it could simply be a case of ensuring the bill was possible in practical terms. The source pointed to the example of backbench amendments bringing equal marriage and abortion to Northern Ireland, where some of the stated timetables were not possible. \u2022 This article was amended on 3 September 2019 to remove suggestions that the prime minister has the power to call a snap election. The Fixed-term Parliaments Act makes the calling of a general election outside five-year terms the decision of the House of Commons, not the prime minister.",

And I trust James Wood who is my favorite book critic. Often I read reviews of books after I have finished them and I find my self saying: \u201cHow did I miss that??\u201d This is a little gem that sharpens my reading experience. James Wood loves exploring the reality in fiction and how it is done; how we connect to the truth in fiction. He writes as a formal critic; yet also as an enthusiastic fellow reader, which makes him good company. \ud83d\udcda #guardianbooks #jameswood #literarycriticism #booksaboutbooks #howfictionworks #picadorbooks #bookreviewers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;A post shared by @&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/booksnourish_caroleann/&quot; style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; booksnourish_caroleann&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2019-08-31T15:18:42+00:00&quot;&gt;Aug 31, 2019 at 8:18am PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&quot;//www.instagram.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",
      "body": "<p>Welcome to this week\u2019s blogpost. Here\u2019s our roundup of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2019/aug/26/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week\">your comments and photos</a> from last week.</p> <p>A timely read from <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/14992181\">interwar</a>, who has been enjoying The Fortnight in September by RC Sherriff:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The perfect, gentle book for an overheated day, inserting a little sweetness into sour times. It follows a lower-middle-class family on holiday at the seaside c. 1930. The pleasure these unremarkable but good people derive from small things - a beach hut with a balcony, a military band concert, a tea of bread and jam - is balanced against the limitations and disappointments of their lives. RC Sherriff\u2019s novel provides a vivid picture of ordinary life in a world in some ways very different from ours, and in other ways totally recognisable.</p> </blockquote> <p>Also apt for the moment is Goldstein by Volker Kutscher, as <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4660292\">gavernism </a>explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is set in Weimar Republic Germany in the late 20s and early 30s. Reading while parliament is being prorogued is quite strange actually; made me feel closer to the characters and scenarios in the novels as there is an uncertainty that runs through the novels ...</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/15798790\">Veufveuve </a>has been reading Greg Grandin\u2019s The End of the Myth: From The Frontier To The Border Wall In The Mind Of America:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I thought this was a (provocatively) brilliant take on US history. The myth of the frontier, an ever moving zone of possibility, not only shaped American notions of freedom (individual rights over human rights) but was always also about who was outside the frontier, implanting nativism and racism deep in the culture. Always racialised and policed through violence, the idea of the frontier, now that the limits of expansion have been met, has curdled into something even darker: an inward-looking nihilistic rage that (white) America cannot forever have it all. Maybe none of this is new but I learned a great deal from this book.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u201cOne of my favourite Japanese authors is Sawako Arioshi,\u201d says <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12515333\">ChronicExpat</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>During her lifetime she was one of Japan\u2019s better-known writers but lately she seems somewhat less frequently read, which I think is rather a pity. She was ahead of her time in addressing social issues in her writing, such as the environment and the impact of cultural change on the lives of Japanese women. I am aware of only three of her novels being available in translation, but they are among her best: The River Ki (1959), The Doctor\u2019s Wife (1966) and The Twilight Years (1972). All three are (in my opinion) wonderful reading experiences but I would especially recommend The Twilight Years, which was one of the earlier Japanese novels to address the issue of dementia and the incredible strain placed upon women when they are obliged to become carers for ageing relatives.</p> </blockquote> <p>Staying with Japan, <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/14950570\">Marc de Faoite </a>has been reading The Memory Police by Y\u014dko Ogawa, translated by Stephen Snyder:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If Franz Kafka was a Japanese woman, she might have written a book like this. This is one of those novels that has a mini-novel inside it, always a risky move, but Ogawa pulls it off, with both stories intertwining and finally converging beautifully. A sad novel about memory and loss and fascism and the tenuous bonds that bring people together.</p> </blockquote> <p>And <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16488741\">Alexia_R</a> has been \u201cwryly amused\u201d by Convenience Store Woman by Sayaka Murata, translated by Ginny Tapley Takemori:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The story of a thirtysomething Japanese woman who is neither married nor has a high-flying career, but instead works in a shop. Her friends and family dedicate some effort to showing her how wrong this is. (I was reminded of the title of Jeanette Winterson\u2019s autobiography, \u201cWhy be happy when you can be normal?\u201d) I\u2019m sure I haven\u2019t seen more comparisons to Eleanor Oliphant ... the main characters certainly struck me as having some overlaps. I liked this and was wryly amused by it in places, but I didn\u2019t love it.</p> </blockquote> <p>Finally, <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2087730\">davidgl51 </a>recommends School for Love by the \u201cunfairly neglected\u201d Olivia Manning:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This novel is set in Jerusalem during the second world war and is seen through the eyes of Felix, a 16 year old orphan who is taken into the \u201ccare\u201d of Ethel Bohun, the landlady of a guesthouse. The monstrous Miss Bohun dominates the novel.

      "bodyText": "Welcome to this week\u2019s blogpost. Here\u2019s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week. A timely read from interwar, who has been enjoying The Fortnight in September by RC Sherriff: The perfect, gentle book for an overheated day, inserting a little sweetness into sour times. It follows a lower-middle-class family on holiday at the seaside c. 1930. The pleasure these unremarkable but good people derive from small things - a beach hut with a balcony, a military band concert, a tea of bread and jam - is balanced against the limitations and disappointments of their lives. RC Sherriff\u2019s novel provides a vivid picture of ordinary life in a world in some ways very different from ours, and in other ways totally recognisable. Also apt for the moment is Goldstein by Volker Kutscher, as gavernism explains: It is set in Weimar Republic Germany in the late 20s and early 30s. Reading while parliament is being prorogued is quite strange actually; made me feel closer to the characters and scenarios in the novels as there is an uncertainty that runs through the novels ... Veufveuve has been reading Greg Grandin\u2019s The End of the Myth: From The Frontier To The Border Wall In The Mind Of America: I thought this was a (provocatively) brilliant take on US history. The myth of the frontier, an ever moving zone of possibility, not only shaped American notions of freedom (individual rights over human rights) but was always also about who was outside the frontier, implanting nativism and racism deep in the culture. Always racialised and policed through violence, the idea of the frontier, now that the limits of expansion have been met, has curdled into something even darker: an inward-looking nihilistic rage that (white) America cannot forever have it all. Maybe none of this is new but I learned a great deal from this book. \u201cOne of my favourite Japanese authors is Sawako Arioshi,\u201d says ChronicExpat: During her lifetime she was one of Japan\u2019s better-known writers but lately she seems somewhat less frequently read, which I think is rather a pity. She was ahead of her time in addressing social issues in her writing, such as the environment and the impact of cultural change on the lives of Japanese women. I am aware of only three of her novels being available in translation, but they are among her best: The River Ki (1959), The Doctor\u2019s Wife (1966) and The Twilight Years (1972). All three are (in my opinion) wonderful reading experiences but I would especially recommend The Twilight Years, which was one of the earlier Japanese novels to address the issue of dementia and the incredible strain placed upon women when they are obliged to become carers for ageing relatives. Staying with Japan, Marc de Faoite has been reading The Memory Police by Y\u014dko Ogawa, translated by Stephen Snyder: If Franz Kafka was a Japanese woman, she might have written a book like this. This is one of those novels that has a mini-novel inside it, always a risky move, but Ogawa pulls it off, with both stories intertwining and finally converging beautifully. A sad novel about memory and loss and fascism and the tenuous bonds that bring people together. And Alexia_R has been \u201cwryly amused\u201d by Convenience Store Woman by Sayaka Murata, translated by Ginny Tapley Takemori: The story of a thirtysomething Japanese woman who is neither married nor has a high-flying career, but instead works in a shop. Her friends and family dedicate some effort to showing her how wrong this is. (I was reminded of the title of Jeanette Winterson\u2019s autobiography, \u201cWhy be happy when you can be normal?\u201d) I\u2019m sure I haven\u2019t seen more comparisons to Eleanor Oliphant ... the main characters certainly struck me as having some overlaps. I liked this and was wryly amused by it in places, but I didn\u2019t love it. Finally, davidgl51 recommends School for Love by the \u201cunfairly neglected\u201d Olivia Manning: This novel is set in Jerusalem during the second world war and is seen through the eyes of Felix, a 16 year old orphan who is taken into the \u201ccare\u201d of Ethel Bohun, the landlady of a guesthouse. The monstrous Miss Bohun dominates the novel. An evangelical Christian who leads a sect called \u201cThe Ever Ready Group of Wise Virgins\u201d, she sets aside a large empty front room for the imminent second coming of the Lord. She thinks that she is generous but is in fact a hypocritical skinflint, virtually starving the other residents of the poorly-heated guesthouse. A coming of age tale that is also a tragic-comic masterpiece. Sounds astonishing. Interesting links about books and reading Anagrams of \u201cErnest Hemingway\u201d That Could Sort of Almost Be Titles of His Novels The New York Times hails Kochland, the story of the rise of the notorious climate-crisis denying Koch brothers, as \u201camong the best books ever written about an American corporation.\u201d The confessions of Karl Marx. Re-reading all of Margaret Atwood\u2019s novels. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have one of the motherfuckers in my house for anything.\u201d Kurt Vonnegut on guns.

      "bodyText": "Time for a quick recap Britain\u2019s manufacturers have recorded the sharpest drop in factory output for seven years as mounting concerns over no-deal Brexit and the slowing global economy hit orders across the country. Activity plunged in August to the lowest levels since July 2012, according to the latest factory PMI survey The report found that EU-based customers are shunning British manufacturers as the risk of no-deal Brexit mounts, rerouting supply chains away from the UK as the likelihood of border disruption after 31 October increases. Economists said the drop in the UK factory PMI, to just 47.4, was a very worrying sign, indicating manufacturing is in recession. Make UK, the industry body, warned that Brexit worries were \u201cseriously undermining\u201d the sector. European manufacturing also contracted last month, dragged back by a stark slump in German factory output. Spain, Italy, Ireland and Austria also suffered falling output, while the picture brightened in France. Argentina has been forced to introduce currency controls, after the peso plunged alarmingly in recent weeks. Under the plan, companies will need permission to access the foreign exchange markets, and must repatriate overseas earnings, while individuals will be restricted about how any dollars they can buy. The pound has tumbled by a cent against the US dollar to a two-week low, on rumours of a snap general election. This has pushed the FTSE 100 up up over 1%, hitting a one-month high this morning. Back in the financial markets, Argentinian assets are slumping after the country imposed restrictions on companies and individuals from accessing the currency markets. As explained earlier, the Argentinian government imposed currency controls overnight, after the peso plunged by a quarter during August. In response, Argentinian bonds have plunged today, as investors calculated that the country is increasingly likely to default. Some hit record lows - meaning investors face heavy losses. Reuters has the details: Argentina\u2019s benchmark international 2028 dollar bonds dropped more than 2 cents to a new low of 36.58 cents, according to Refinitiv data. Bonds maturing in 2023 and 2038 recorded similar losses. Argentina\u2019s euro-denominated sovereign bonds also suffered hefty losses to hit record lows on Monday. The 2022 bond dropped 9.2 cents to 35.8 cents while the 2027 issue tumbled 7.5 cents to 33.218 cents, according to Refinitiv data. This chart from Sky News shows how the UK factory sector has been shrinking for several months (at least according to the PMI surveys) The euro is also weakening today, hurt by economic worries. The single currency has sunk below $1.096 for the first time since May 2017, after traders learned that Europe\u2019s factories kept shrinking last month. There\u2019s plenty of speculation that the European Central Bank will unleash a new stimulus programme this month, perhaps by imposing even deeper negative interest rates on commercial banks to encourage lending. Reuters blames the escalating US-China trade war, which is hurting European manufacturers. Make UK, which represents UK manufacturers, is deeply concerned by the tumble in August\u2019s factory PMI. Their chief economist, Seamus Nevin, says such a large slump in new orders hasn\u2019t been seen since the financial crisis a decade ago: \u201cThe unprecedented economic and political uncertainty in the UK, as fears of a crash out Brexit grow, is continuing to seriously undermine the performance of UK manufacturing. Business confidence has now fallen to an all-time low and consumer purchases, which have driven what little economic growth we have seen recently, has also now worsened. \u201cEmployment in the sector fell at one of the fastest rates for almost seven years, and capital investments have shrunk too. \u201cWhile global markets are still struggling and orders from the USA and Asia are shrinking the slump in the Eurozone, the UK\u2019s biggest export market, has reversed slightly on the back of French manufacturers signalling a renewed improvement in operating conditions and German PMI improving from July\u2019s seven-year low. However, anxiety about the UK\u2019s post-Brexit trade rules means British manufacturers are not seeing the benefit. \u201cInstead, EU-based clients were routing supply chains away from the UK and consequently new orders have contracted at their fastest pace since the worst days of the Global Financial Crisis.\u201d The slide in the pound has pushed the FTSE 100 share index up to a one-month high. The blue-chip index has jumped by 100 points to 7307, its highest point since 5 August. This 1.3% gain is being driven by multinational companies with overseas earnings, including drinks group Diageo (up 2.3%) and weapons maker BAE Systems (+2%). The FTSE 250 index, which contains smaller, more UK-focused companies, is up 0.5%. Britain\u2019s factory sector is underperforming most of Europe. But Germany, on the brink of recession, is doing even worse. The German manufacturing PM was just 43.5, which means an even sharper contraction than the UK\u2019s 47.4 (reminder, 50=stagnation). Germany\u2019s woes dragged the wider eurozone factory PMI down to 47.0. The pound has fallen sharply this morning, hit by the weak factory data and the political crisis in Westminster. Sterling has shed three-quarters of a cent against the US dollar to $1.2080, a two-week low. Neil Wilson of Markets.com say today\u2019s manufacturing PMI is \u201csimply shocking\u201d, The headline PMI reading fell to 47.4, its weakest since July 2012. New orders declined at the fastest clip in seven years. And crucially confidence is on the floor, with manufacturers as pessimistic as they have ever been. He reckons the global economic slowdown, not Brexit, is the main culprit: Uncertainty over the outcome of Brexit is certainly a drag on sentiment but we should be hopeful that this will be resolved presently. The data for the UK economy may well now get worse before it gets better. We need to assess the Services PMI on Wednesday for more clues about whether Q3 could herald a contraction. And as consistently stated, it also makes the next move for the Bank of England down, not up. Speculation that Britain could be heading for a snap election is also weighing on the pound today. Boris Johnson is now threatening to bar Conservative MP from running in the next election if they try to block a no-deal Brexit. Our Politics Liveblog has all the details: Analysts at Nordea Markets say today\u2019s UK factory PMI is terrible, and could force the Bank of England to cut interest rates: Duncan Brock, Group Director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, says Britain\u2019s factories are struggling badly, as fears of a disorderly Brexit hurt the sector. Here\u2019s his take on the news that UK factory growth slumped to a seven-year low last month: \u201cThe sector\u2019s illness took a turn for the worse in August with the sharpest decline in domestic and export orders for seven years. Investment continued to peter out and heightened concerns about the UK\u2019s political situation and the strength of the global economy acted as a drag on activity. \u201cAs some clients from the Eurozone continued to move their supply chains away from the UK, declining orders from the US and Asia dashed any hopes of redemption, resulting in the sharpest fall in business optimism since at least 2012. \u201cSoured by the continuing intensely difficult conditions, the sector resorted to some job shedding and increased their own prices as a last-ditch effort against renewed pressure from a weakening pound. \u201cAs Brexit planning intensifies, some firms were resorting to more inventory building whilst others were unravelling their stocks. With some supplies impacted by port delays and poor supplier performance, a creeping dread is descending on the sector that there will be more of these obstacles to come.\u201d Incidentally, PMI stands for Purchasing Managers Index. Markit contacts a wide range of senior staff responsible for spending decisions, to gauge how their business is performing. More here. In theory, a cheaper currency should boost exports. But today\u2019s PMI survey shows that British factories aren\u2019t getting much benefit from the weak pound. Rob Dobson, Director at IHS Markit, points out that a cheap currency also hurts factories, as it pushes up their import costs. \u201cDemand from domestic and export markets both weakened in August, with new export business suffering the sharpest fall in seven years. The global economic slowdown was the main factor weighing on new work received from Europe, the USA and Asia. There was also a further impact from some EU-based clients routing supply chains away from the UK due to Brexit. \u201cThe further downturn in export orders occurred despite a weakening in the sterling exchange at the start of the month. This was felt on the costs front though, with 80% of companies providing a reason for higher purchase prices making at least some reference to the exchange rate. The current high degree of market uncertainty, both at home and abroad, and currency volatility will need to reduce significantly if UK manufacturing is to make any positive strides towards recovery in the coming months.\u201d Panmure Gordon\u2019s Simon French points out that factories around the world are struggling, but there are signs of stabilisation in Europe and China: Danske Bank say British factories are suffering from a range of problems - with Brexit acting as a nasty supply shock. In a blow to Britain\u2019s industrial heartland, UK factories shed staff last month as fears of a no-deal Brexit grew. Markit reports: Manufacturing employment fell at one of the fastest rates over the past six-and-a-half years in August. Job cuts were driven by cost saving initiatives (including reorganisations and redundancies), slower economic growth and the continued impact of Brexit uncertainty. Newsflash: Britain\u2019s factory sector is shrinking at its fastest rate in seven years, as the Brexit crisis hurts the UK economy. Data firm Markit reports that new orders tumbled last month, with activity sliding at its fastest pace since 2012. Steep reductions in new orders were seen across the consumer, intermediate and investment goods industries, driving output down across the sector. Business confidence has also cratered, hitting its lowest level since Markit began tracking it in 2012. Markit\u2019s UK manufacturing PMI, based on interviews with factory bosses across the UK, fell to just 47.4 - weaker than the 48.4 expected, and deeper into contraction (anything below 50 shows the sector shrank). Markit blames high levels of \u201ceconomic and political uncertainty\u201d, with Brexit adding to a wider slowdown in the global economy. The ongoing US-China trade war is also hurting. It says: The level of new export business contracted at the fastest rate in over seven years in August. Ongoing global trade tensions, slower world economic growth and Brexit uncertainty were all mentioned by manufacturers as factors contributing to reduced overseas demand. There were reports that some EU-based clients were routing supply chains away from the UK due to Brexit. Newsflash: Europe\u2019s factory sector has shrunk for seven months in a row, as Germany continues to suffer economic problems. Data firm Markit has reported that its eurozone manufacturing PMI was 47.0 in August. Any reading below 50 shows a contraction, so this means factories have been shrinking since last December. Companies reported that production and new orders fell again last month, while business confidence has fallen to its lowest level since 2012 -- suggesting more trouble ahead. Conditions worsened in Germany, Austria, Ireland, Italy and Spain, while France, the Netherlands and Greece reported growth. Chris Williamson, chief Business Economist at IHS Markit says: \u201cPrices are falling as companies offer discounts in the face of disappointingly weak demand, and payroll numbers are being culled at one of the steepest rates seen over the past six years as companies increasingly seek to cut costs in the uncertain trading environment. \u201cTrade wars and tariffs remain the biggest concerns among producers, and the escalation of global trade war tensions in August encouraged further risk aversion. \u201cGermany is suffering the steepest decline, in part reflecting slumping global demand for autos and business machinery. While France bucked a wider downturn trend, even here growth was only very modest.\u201d Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank predicts more fireworks from Argentina this week, telling clients: It will also be worth keeping an eye on Argentina this week after capital controls were put in place over the weekend to help them stem the large losses of reserves towards the end of last week after a more than 25% decline in the peso over the last month after primary elections showed that the relatively market friendly government has little chance of retaining power in full elections next month. Argentina\u2019s imposition of currency controls comes just a week after Greece lifted its own restrictions on moving money around. Elso Lignos of Royal Bank of Canada says: In Argentina, things are set to get worse with weekend news the government is re-imposing capital controls (lifted by Macri) and is seeking a \u201cvoluntary re-profiling\u201d of its debt. Meanwhile Greece has come full circle, lifting its capital controls after four years. This chart shows just the peso has weakened in recent years, before taking a huge plunge last month: That forced Argentina to impose currency controls, after burning through an estimated $10bn in foreign currency reserves in a not-very-successful propping up exercise. There should be some red faces in the City over Argentina\u2019s economic crisis. Two years ago, investors scrambled to buy a new 100-year bond issued by president Macri\u2019s government, ignoring Argentina\u2019s track record of debt problems. Just two years later, that bond has slumped in value and could be restructured. Allianz\u2019s chief economic advisor, Mohamed A. El-Erian, tweets: An IMF spokesperson has said the Fund will analyze the details of Argentina\u2019s \u201ccapital flow management measures\u201d, adding: \u201cStaff will remain in close contact with the authorities in the period ahead and the fund will continue to stand with Argentina during these challenging times.\u201d Argentina\u2019s new currency controls are an embarrassing u-turn for President Mauricio Macri, who had billed himself as a reformer. Macri had previously lifted many protectionist practices of his predecessor, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, points out Reuters: After opposition candidate Alberto Fernandez and Fernandez de Kirchner, who is now his vice presidential candidate, pulled off a stunning upset in the Aug. 11 primary vote, bonds, stocks and the peso currency plummeted on market fears over a potential return to the interventionist policies of Fernandez de Kirchner\u2019s previous government. Macri\u2019s government and the central bank are trying to stabilize the economy as the Oct. 27 presidential election looms, for which Fernandez is now the front-runner. The Financial Times fears these currency controls could scupper Argentina\u2019s current IMF bailout. It explains: Investors had been expecting some form of capital controls. But some fear that the move could jeopardise the IMF\u2019s latest disbursement of its $57bn bailout programme secured by Argentina during a currency crisis last year, with a $5.4bn tranche due by the end of September. \u201cHow is the IMF supposed to disburse the last tranche into this environment?\u201d asked Ed Al-Hussainy, an analyst at Columbia Threadneedle, noting it is a \u201cmassive moral hazard\u201d. Germany\u2019s DW flags up that fears of a default have been rising. Argentina fell into recession under President Mauricio Macri in 2018. The country faces rising unemployment and one of the world\u2019s highest inflation rates \u2014 running at over 55%. Fearing a default, some Argentines withdrew their savings from banks at the end of August. Sky News\u2019s Ian King says that Macri\u2019s move to restructure Argentian\u2019s debt last week escalated the panic: Buenos Aires said on Wednesday that it was extending the maturity of many of its government bonds, in other words, telling lenders they would be getting their money back further into the future than they were expecting. S&amp;P said this amounted to a default - making it the ninth time Argentina has reneged on its debts and the third time this century. Accordingly, S&amp;P said it was cutting Argentina\u2019s credit rating to CCC, the lowest possible. The response on Friday was aggressive selling of Argentinian government bonds by investors, particularly big German pension funds, sparking a slump in prices. The yield - which rises as the price of a bond falls and which is akin to an interest rate - on the benchmark Argentinian bond due for repayment in 2028 shot up to 22.2%. At the beginning of the month, the yield on such bonds was 9.57%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The economic crisis gripping Argentina has taken a worrying twist, with the country\u2019s government imposing currency controls in an attempt to support its economy. Following a 25% slump in the value of the peso during August, Argentina has taken the dramatic move to restrict exporters and citizens when purchasing foreign currency or making transfers abroad. President Mauricio Macri\u2019s administration announced last night it would take: \u201c...a series of extraordinary measures to ensure the normal functioning of the economy, to sustain the level of activity and employment and protect the consumers.\u201d Under the plan: Foreign companies will need permission from the central bank to access the foreign exchange market to purchase foreign currency and make transfers abroad. Exporters must repatriate earnings from sales abroad. Individuals would only be allowed to purchase up to $10,000 a month \u201cto protect savers and achieve greater exchange rate stability\u201d. The measures are designed to \u201cmaintain currency stability\u201d, according to Argentina\u2019s central bank. They also highlight how Argentina is lurching deeper into a new financial crisis. The move comes three weeks after Macri suffered a shock defeat to left-wing rival Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez in presidential primary elections. That prompted a collapse in share prices in Buenos Aires, weakened Argentina\u2019s bonds dramatically, and sent the peso stumbling. Last week, Macri\u2019s government said it would delay interest payments on tens of billions of dollars of debt, and try to extend the maturity of the loans. It also hopes to restructure the $44bn loan recently advanced by the IMF. With fears of a debt default rampant, Argentina\u2019s central bank has been burning through its currency reserves in a bid to prop up the peso. Currency controls could help, but will also have a damaging impact on its economy. Also coming up today New manufacturing PMI reports from around the globe are likely to show that factories are still struggling. Output is thought to have fallen in both the UK and the eurozone in August, as the US-China trade war hits demand. That trade war deepened last weekend, as America imposed fresh tariffs on $112bn (\u00a392bn) of Chinese imports such as shoes, nappies and food. In response, Beijing began to introduce measures targeting $75bn worth of US goods. Wall Street will be closed for Labour Day, so the markets could be subdued. The agenda 9am BST: Eurozone manufacturing PMI for August (expected to remain at 47, showing a contraction). 9.30am BST: UK manufacturing PMI for August (expected to rise to 48.4, from 48, showing a slower contraction).",

      "bodyText": "Finland is facing calls from the Council of Europe to reform its rape laws to criminalise a lack of consent rather than just the use of violence. The human rights body said Finland\u2019s legislation lagged behind international standards despite the country\u2019s strong record in furthering gender equality. The council\u2019s group of experts on action against violence against women and domestic violence \u201cstrongly encouraged\u201d swift action in its first report on the country. It said: \u201cRape continues to be categorised according to the degree of physical violence used or threatened by the perpetrator or a requirement to show that the victim was in a state of fear or helplessness and unable to defend herself or to formulate or express her will. \u201cThe problem with this approach is that it does not fully capture the realities of women experiencing sexual violence and how they respond to threat (ie flight, fight, freeze, flop or befriend).\u201d The council said that as a consequence, \u201cnot all forms of sexual violence are criminalised in Finland \u2026 Other consequences include the requirement of higher thresholds of evidentiary standards of physical resistance and a shifting of the focus on to the victim\u2019s behaviour rather than the accused\u2019s actions.\u201d In response to a series of high-profile cases where lax penalties imposed on offenders caused an outcry, the Finnish ministry of justice has recently established a working group to recommend on required reforms by the end of May 2020. Calls for change were amplified last year when Finland\u2019s supreme court ruled that a man who sexually abused a 10-year-old girl could not be charged with rape as there was no evidence the crime had involved violence or that the child was overcome by fear. Finland\u2019s recently elected centre-left government said in response to the council\u2019s report that its programme published in June had highlighted the need to act against violence against women and raise the level of resources spent on those involved. The council\u2019s report said criminal penalties for sexual offences in Finland were \u201cvery low\u201d in comparison with other signatories to the Council of Europe\u2019s Istanbul convention, which sets standards for its members. The council\u2019s report also highlighted the need to increase the number of female police officers in Finland, the lack of training available to prosecutors and law enforcement officers on intervening in cases involving sexual violence, and the need for more shelters for those suffering abuse in their homes. Finland regularly emerges as a leading light in gender equality rankings, and it was the first country to grant women full political rights, but its approach to sexual violence, along with that of its Nordic neighbours, has long been a concern. Last November, Amnesty International published a report in which it claimed that out of 31 European countries they examined, only eight had consent-based definitions of rape. Denmark also defines rape as involving force or a threat of violence, rather than looking at whether or not there was consent. Anna Blus, Amnesty International\u2019s women\u2019s rights researcher in Europe, said: \u201cIn many ways, Finland is a model country for gender equality, but its antiquated rape laws are badly failing women.

Ten years on, he is a fully fledged driver and he loves being at the controls of the great steam and diesel engines that trundle through the Dorset countryside.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s lovely to work on these really elegant old heritage machines,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve all got their quirks \u2013 even engines of the same class behave in different ways. You have to learn to know what they like and what they don\u2019t want.\u201d</p> <p>Heritage railways across the UK attract millions of visitors and passengers a year but a shortage of young volunteer drivers such as Au is worrying the industry.</p> <p>The Swanage railway in Dorset has 42 drivers. The oldest is 79 and the youngest is Au at 27. As the older ones step down from the footplate for the last time, there is a dearth of younger people ready to jump in. The shortage means the railway draws in people from far and wide: one driver comes from the east Midlands; another enthusiast travels all the way from Preston.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a problem across the nation,\u201d said Au, from Poole. \u201cThe generation of British Rail drivers who worked on steam is going. The big challenge is to get young people interested in the preservation side of it.\u201d</p> <p>The career progression is the same as it was in the golden age of steam. \u201cYou start as a cleaner, getting to know the locomotives, the engine, the parts, the drivers. After a couple of years you may become a fireman and then eventually a driver. It\u2019s very structured.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d212d8dc812f0a5ea1dbeff4e857421adc7721ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d212d8dc812f0a5ea1dbeff4e857421adc7721ba/134_497_3499_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nathan Au\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nathan Au: \u2018It\u2019s lovely to work on these really elegant old heritage machines.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Yeomans/BNPS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The variety of the engines that Au drives through the Isle of Purbeck countryside is a thrill for him. The minimum number of shifts a driver has to do is 15 a year. When he was a student, Au did 80, and now he manages between 20 and 30. \u201cThe more time you put in, the faster you progress,\u201d he said. His day job is also connected to the railways: he is a rolling stock engineer with Siemens.</p> <p>There are two main attractions for Au \u2013 the locomotives and the people. \u201cEveryone appreciates a steam engine, don\u2019t they? I like the engineering side of it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the other half is the people.</p> <p>\u201cThe railway is one big family. The beauty of it is that you have so many different jobs in one organisation \u2013 the drivers, the people in the booking office and in catering. You get to know people across other railways as well. I go to <a href=\"https://www.iwsteamrailway.co.uk/\">the Isle of Wight railway</a> to lend a hand.

It made sense for me to sign on as a volunteer too.\u201d</p> <p>She is currently working towards becoming a cleaner, the first rung on the ladder to the footplate. \u201cI help out in the morning, getting the train prepped. It would be lovely to drive a train but I\u2019m aware it takes some time.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cI do like a steam engine. When there\u2019s a diesel gala on I\u2019m not at all fussed but I love the steam galas. They evoke the old romance of travel \u2013 they\u2019re really something to see.\u201d</p> <p>It is not all romance, however. Attfield-Haines\u2019s favourite locomotive used to be <a href=\"https://www.swanagerailway.co.uk/stock/detail/sr-4-6-2-battle-of-britain-class-no-34070-manston\">Manston,</a> an impressive Battle of Britain-class engine. \u201cBut the last time we went out on her she ended up burning Ash quite badly on his back, so I\u2019m not quite so keen on her. It can be a hazardous job \u2013 they are fiery machines.\u201d</p> <p>And modern life is very busy. Attfield-Haines\u2019s veterinary work means she cannot put as much time into the railway as she would like. \u201cWhen you have the time you can volunteer, but when something else comes along like a career it gets harder,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame, you get so much out of it.\u201d </p>",

      "bodyText": "Nathan Au began volunteering on the Swanage railway at the age of 17. Ten years on, he is a fully fledged driver and he loves being at the controls of the great steam and diesel engines that trundle through the Dorset countryside. \u201cIt\u2019s lovely to work on these really elegant old heritage machines,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve all got their quirks \u2013 even engines of the same class behave in different ways. You have to learn to know what they like and what they don\u2019t want.\u201d Heritage railways across the UK attract millions of visitors and passengers a year but a shortage of young volunteer drivers such as Au is worrying the industry. The Swanage railway in Dorset has 42 drivers. The oldest is 79 and the youngest is Au at 27. As the older ones step down from the footplate for the last time, there is a dearth of younger people ready to jump in. The shortage means the railway draws in people from far and wide: one driver comes from the east Midlands; another enthusiast travels all the way from Preston. \u201cIt\u2019s a problem across the nation,\u201d said Au, from Poole. \u201cThe generation of British Rail drivers who worked on steam is going. The big challenge is to get young people interested in the preservation side of it.\u201d The career progression is the same as it was in the golden age of steam. \u201cYou start as a cleaner, getting to know the locomotives, the engine, the parts, the drivers. After a couple of years you may become a fireman and then eventually a driver. It\u2019s very structured.\u201d The variety of the engines that Au drives through the Isle of Purbeck countryside is a thrill for him. The minimum number of shifts a driver has to do is 15 a year. When he was a student, Au did 80, and now he manages between 20 and 30. \u201cThe more time you put in, the faster you progress,\u201d he said. His day job is also connected to the railways: he is a rolling stock engineer with Siemens. There are two main attractions for Au \u2013 the locomotives and the people. \u201cEveryone appreciates a steam engine, don\u2019t they? I like the engineering side of it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the other half is the people. \u201cThe railway is one big family. The beauty of it is that you have so many different jobs in one organisation \u2013 the drivers, the people in the booking office and in catering. You get to know people across other railways as well. I go to the Isle of Wight railway to lend a hand. It means you meet people from all walks of life.\u201d Beth Attfield-Haines, 29, a student veterinary nurse from Bournemouth, is another young volunteer at Swanage. \u201cIt\u2019s my partner\u2019s fault,\u201d she said. \u201cAshley was a volunteer and then got a job there. It made sense for me to sign on as a volunteer too.\u201d She is currently working towards becoming a cleaner, the first rung on the ladder to the footplate. \u201cI help out in the morning, getting the train prepped. It would be lovely to drive a train but I\u2019m aware it takes some time.\u201d She added: \u201cI do like a steam engine. When there\u2019s a diesel gala on I\u2019m not at all fussed but I love the steam galas. They evoke the old romance of travel \u2013 they\u2019re really something to see.\u201d It is not all romance, however. Attfield-Haines\u2019s favourite locomotive used to be Manston, an impressive Battle of Britain-class engine. \u201cBut the last time we went out on her she ended up burning Ash quite badly on his back, so I\u2019m not quite so keen on her. It can be a hazardous job \u2013 they are fiery machines.\u201d And modern life is very busy. Attfield-Haines\u2019s veterinary work means she cannot put as much time into the railway as she would like. \u201cWhen you have the time you can volunteer, but when something else comes along like a career it gets harder,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame, you get so much out of it.\u201d",

I am genuinely fascinated by celeb culture from that era. I think people were less aware of how far they could go in simply being a celebrity, and what kind of empire they could build. So in a way, characters were more authentic. Now, people know of the potential earnings that they could get, so I feel authenticity is very questionable.</p> <p>And X Factor: I think talent shows have been around for decades and if X Factor finishes, something else will come up in another format. Talent shows in the simple format are really enjoyable and should always be around. The toxicity that can gather around them and stuff that goes on behind the scenes is really damaging and maybe one day it will be made public.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d6d10a58f085a442811633a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-02T12:53:27.753Z\">1.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">The last time I went on Loose Women, Janet Street-Porter and I had a love-in about tomatoes</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/1591619\"><br>SamWolfson </a>asks:</p> <p><em>You do a lot of terrestrial TV appearances on Sunday Brunch, Loose Women, One Show etc. Which of those shows is the most enjoyable to do and which makes you wish you had never become a pop star?</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/live/2019/aug/28/will-young-webchat#comment-132608676\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/101721630\" title=\"View will_young\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/101721630\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for will_young\"> </a> <span class=\"d2-badge d2-badge-contributor d2-hidetext\" title=\"Guardian contributor\" itemprop=\"jobTitle\">Guardian contributor</span> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/101721630\" title=\"View will_young\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">will_young</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/132608676\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">02 September 2019 1:48pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>I do do a lot of terrestrial TV and sometimes I do think to myself, oh my god, I just want to move to Somerset and open an Airbnb. Sometimes I do think, when I wanted to do music, I didn't think that I would be doing certain things. However, I love promoting something that I feel super proud of and that I genuinely believe has a place in the pop world. With every job, there are always things that one doesn't want to do, and I like that because it reminds me that I do just do a job. Now, to the pressing matter of what is my favourite show to do... I'm going to give highlights from each show. Sunday Brunch: I am such a shit cook that I like playing up to it and making people laugh. The downside: it is the longest show in the history of television. Loose Women: for me, it's always too short because once I get going with the panel, we're having a real laugh. The last time I went on, myself and Janet Street-Porter had a love-in about tomatoes. The One Show: my latest experience on the One Show was quite stressful because there was a problem with my music. Someone had sent the backing track and all it had on it was a beat... This was with 40 minutes to go until a live performance with 50 dancers. I tried my best to be mindful in this situation and I am very proud that I didn't lose my rag. The backing track turned up with 10 minutes to go...</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-02T12:55:00.750Z\">at 1.55pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d6d103f8f081c5d7489e4b9\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-02T12:51:46.490Z\">1.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">I think social media is the devil incarnate.

What could have made your teenage years better and what advice would you give on coming out? kdee6969 asks: If you could only achieve one thing from an imaginary bucket list, what would it be? AlexNeedham asks: Your book is called How to be a Gay Man. Who do you think has got it sussed out? My other question is, what kind of world would we currently be living in if all the people who died of Aids had survived? MichaelCragg asks: Do you think losing out to Danny from The Script as a judge on The Voice was actually a blessing in disguise? RossWilliamQuinn asks: You\u2019ve done a bit of acting (Mrs Henderson Presents) and of course singing. If you had the opportunity to do one of these big film musicals that are all the fashion which would be your perfect role? Or would you like to do something totally new? Harriet Gibsone asks: Do you think the X Factor can survive in the modern era? And did you watch the Jade Goody documentary? Wondered if you had any thoughts on early 00s celebrity culture. SamWolfson asks: You do a lot of terrestrial TV appearances on Sunday Brunch, Loose Women, One Show etc. Which of those shows is the most enjoyable to do and which makes you wish you had never become a pop star? organicplastic asks: If you ruled the world how would you tackle some of the most pressing problems of our age? ID7188412 asks: I always thought you could have been a bit more adventurous in your early career. Was it a relief to cast off the shackles of Simon Cowell\u2019s record label and how much influence did you have on your song choices? Gill10 asks: Some of us know how you love jazz music and singing it live. So who is your favourite songwriter and lyricist combination from the Great American Songbook era? sicrates asks: As you have grown older and wiser, do you drove more carefully now? Lisatymon asks: Your battle with ptsd &amp; depression is a well-documented one &amp; as I myself &amp; family members have struggled I really appreciate you keeping it in the public eye. Have you any plans to do more talks and would you consider coming more up north? It really is good to see you much happier! unclearleo asks: You must have met the Spice Girls on your travels across the children\u2019s entertainment circuit. Which one was the least annoying? surrealteacher asks: If we all moved to an alternate universe where there is no music, how would you spend your time? Nick Hardy asks: I\u2019m gay and know lots of gay men but they are all quite different and some wouldn\u2019t want to be like the others if you paid them. How can you tell anyone how to be a gay man? What is a gay man? Raphael Howard asks: How did it feel to win a Brit award for Your Game? Are you disappointed that the song remains relatively obscure despite its success? ProjectXRay asks: I used to look a little bit like you about 10-15 years ago, and I was mistaken for you a few times in the 2000\u2019s. A couple times your fans approached me with tears in their eyes, and teared up even more when I told them I wasn\u2019t actually you. That was OK, but one time I was actually followed around Coventry city centre for what felt like ages by a group of extremely obnoxious teenage girls who thought I was you, and decided to harass \u2018us\u2019. They stalked me for ages, making snide homophobic comments and I ended up screaming at them to leave me alone (accidentally spitting out chewing gum in the process, and probably making you look like some kind of scuzzbucket- apologies), before running away through a shop to get away from them. All of which is a roundabout way of saying that I had a tiny taste of your life in the 2000\u2019s, and it stressed me the hell out. I really respect the way you\u2019ve pursued your career then and since, especially your honesty about experiencing mental health problems. So, in order to make this spiel a question, what are your top 3 survival tips for those experiencing accidental or sudden fame? Or even those being chased around by accident? Martinnew asks: How do you write songs? How much of the music we hear has been rewritten hundreds of times, or do you just write something and think \u201cThat\u2019s it\u201d! I\u2019ve written loads of music, but have finished hardly any of it. I wish I knew why. HJGB246 asks: 101 Dalmatians II: Patch\u2019s London Adventure was one of my favourite Disney films growing up, and I particularly like the song Try Again you did for the film. Would you ever do any singles exclusively for films again? TheBigBadWolf asks: Pre-social media days, your coming out was splashed across the tabloids whereas for LGBT performers today it feels like we know they\u2019re gay from the first moment they emerge in the public eye. How hard was that time for you and was there ever any temptation to delay saying anything? laurasnapes asks: Why do you think so many musicians have started podcasts? What itch does it scratch for you that being a pop star couldn\u2019t? DWFan1 What\u2019s your favourite Pixar film? Will Young is with us now! It\u2019s wild to think that we\u2019re coming up on almost 20 years since Will Young entered the public eye. In 2002, he beat Gareth Gates to win Pop Idol \u2013 and a brilliant British pop star was born. Since then, Young has travelled pretty far from the machine-tooled pop industrial complex: his latest album, Lexicon, is his seventh, and first for an independent label (Cooking Vinyl). In recent interviews, Young has spoken about how liberating he has found independence. (\u201cAt 40, my new thing is: oh, fuck off,\u201d he recently told the i.) He also ditched his management team and found that the resulting calm reinvigorated his love of pop \u2013 aided by collaborators including Richard X and Eg White. Lexicon, he says, is about fun and freedom rather than digging too deep personally, and it sounds like welcome relief after a difficult period. In 2016, he withdrew from Strictly Come Dancing, citing his anxiety, depression and PTSD. He suffered personal losses and professional compromises and, in 2017, said he was going to quit pop. A period performing in Strictly Ballroom in the West End proved reinvigorating, as did leaning in to his activist side. Young was one of the early 2000s\u2019 few out gay pop stars; in recent years, he has been an active campaigner on LGBTQ issues, promoting inclusive kids\u2019 books on CBeebies and presenting two seasons of the award-winning podcast Homo Sapiens with pal Chris Sweeney. (His comments accusing Jeremy Clarkson\u2019s The Grand Tour of homophobia earlier this year were particularly gratifying: \u201cScrew them and the show and Amazon \u2026 for putting this shaming archaic tripe out,\u201d he tweeted.) Thankfully, Young came back around to pop: he has spent the summer playing festivals and seen two singles from Lexicon hit the BBC Radio 2 A-list, while the album only just missed No 1 due to the reign of chart behemoth Lewis Capaldi. This October, he\u2019ll undertake a 21-date tour of the UK, and next year, he\u2019ll release his first book, How to Be a Gay Man. You can ask Young about all that, and anything else, when he comes into Guardian HQ at 1pm on Monday 2 September. Post your questions below.",

      "body": "<p>Britain is training record numbers of workplace \u201cmental health first aiders\u201d to confront a sharp rise in people expressing mental distress, though evidence of success is mixed, according to a Guardian study.</p> <p>Requests sent to every FTSE 100 company show that they alone have trained more than 10,000 staffers, while mid-tier and even tiny businesses are appointing first responders who can be approached confidentially by those with depression, anxiety, stress and other conditions.</p> <p>A national training body, Mental Health First Aid England, said 140,000 people were trained in 2018-19 \u2013 the most ever in a single year, from local hairdressers to employees in global corporations.</p> <p>Almost half a million people in Britain have now been through an MHFA programme \u2013 about one in every 100 adults.</p> <p>\u201cWe have worked in more than 20,000 businesses and organisations,\u201d said its chief executive, Simon Blake. \u201cThe exciting thing for me is that training courses are as likely to have someone from a shop in Doncaster as from a City firm.\u201d</p> <p>In terms of numbers, big firms lead the way. More than half the FTSE 100 companies have mental health first aiders (some call them \u201cbuddies\u201d, \u201cchampions\u201d, \u201cadvocates\u201d or even \u201cbe well allies\u201d).

The construction and finance sectors seem particularly keen. Government departments have trained prodigious numbers: the Department for Work and Pensions alone has more than 1,000, according to Blake.</p> <p>But there is concern that mental health first aiders are being viewed as a panacea when actually their impact can be quite limited.</p> <p>In a report last year, <a href=\"http://www.hse.gov.uk/research/rrhtm/rr1135.htm\">the Health and Safety Executive concluded</a>: \u201cThere is limited evidence that MHFA training leads to sustained improvement in the ability of those trained to help colleagues experiencing mental ill health.\u201d <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197102\">Academic research has found</a> that training is good for raising awareness, but unproven as a strategy for improving mental health.</p> <p>Experts in workplace health warn that some recruits might not be the best people for what is a subtle role, and warn that first aiders need support and supervision themselves to ensure their own wellbeing. They add that a two-day training course does not produce instant experts.</p> <p>Alan Bradshaw, a business psychologist, said: \u201cMy main problem with it is that organisations see it as a tick in the box. It\u2019s essentially reactive, when what they really need to be doing is the preventive bit, the proactive management of stress risks at work.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Jo Billings, a consultant clinical psychologist at UCL, said: \u201cThere are pros and cons. Anything that raises people\u2019s understanding of mental health is a really good thing. But it\u2019s not sufficient to tackle mental illness in the workplace.\u201d </p> <p>While some companies may be keen to simply tick boxes, others say that their first aider programmes are part of a bigger strategy. Some offer free subscriptions to digital tools such as <a href=\"https://www.headspace.com/\">Headspace</a> and <a href=\"https://home.unmind.com/\">Unmind</a>. Others provide counselling and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for staff.

      "bodyText": "Britain is training record numbers of workplace \u201cmental health first aiders\u201d to confront a sharp rise in people expressing mental distress, though evidence of success is mixed, according to a Guardian study. Requests sent to every FTSE 100 company show that they alone have trained more than 10,000 staffers, while mid-tier and even tiny businesses are appointing first responders who can be approached confidentially by those with depression, anxiety, stress and other conditions. A national training body, Mental Health First Aid England, said 140,000 people were trained in 2018-19 \u2013 the most ever in a single year, from local hairdressers to employees in global corporations. Almost half a million people in Britain have now been through an MHFA programme \u2013 about one in every 100 adults. \u201cWe have worked in more than 20,000 businesses and organisations,\u201d said its chief executive, Simon Blake. \u201cThe exciting thing for me is that training courses are as likely to have someone from a shop in Doncaster as from a City firm.\u201d In terms of numbers, big firms lead the way. More than half the FTSE 100 companies have mental health first aiders (some call them \u201cbuddies\u201d, \u201cchampions\u201d, \u201cadvocates\u201d or even \u201cbe well allies\u201d). Lloyds Banking Group has a programme to train 2,500 by next year, while National Grid and Severn Trent both have more than 1,000. The BBC, NHS and other firms including Goldman Sachs are in on the act. The construction and finance sectors seem particularly keen. Government departments have trained prodigious numbers: the Department for Work and Pensions alone has more than 1,000, according to Blake. But there is concern that mental health first aiders are being viewed as a panacea when actually their impact can be quite limited. In a report last year, the Health and Safety Executive concluded: \u201cThere is limited evidence that MHFA training leads to sustained improvement in the ability of those trained to help colleagues experiencing mental ill health.\u201d Academic research has found that training is good for raising awareness, but unproven as a strategy for improving mental health. Experts in workplace health warn that some recruits might not be the best people for what is a subtle role, and warn that first aiders need support and supervision themselves to ensure their own wellbeing. They add that a two-day training course does not produce instant experts. Alan Bradshaw, a business psychologist, said: \u201cMy main problem with it is that organisations see it as a tick in the box. It\u2019s essentially reactive, when what they really need to be doing is the preventive bit, the proactive management of stress risks at work.\u201d Dr Jo Billings, a consultant clinical psychologist at UCL, said: \u201cThere are pros and cons. Anything that raises people\u2019s understanding of mental health is a really good thing. But it\u2019s not sufficient to tackle mental illness in the workplace.\u201d While some companies may be keen to simply tick boxes, others say that their first aider programmes are part of a bigger strategy. Some offer free subscriptions to digital tools such as Headspace and Unmind. Others provide counselling and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for staff. Many have confidential helplines, often known as employee assistance programmes. Mental health first aiders volunteer for the role and typically complete a two-day training session. They are not counsellors, psychologists or experts, but simply first responder \u201clisteners\u201d who can signpost services. Imogen Truphet, who works at the School of Life in London, says the intense two-day course gave her confidence to respond to distressed colleagues without saying the wrong thing. \u201cYou listen without judgment, you give them information and support but you don\u2019t give them advice,\u201d she says. \u201cYou encourage them to seek the appropriate professional help \u2013 mostly but not always about going to your GP \u2013 and encourage them to talk to family and friends.\u201d Natalie Rose, a wellbeing champion for HS2, says: \u201cThe first thing you have to do is listen. Show some understanding, compassion, have patience, point them in the right direction of where they can get some support.\u201d \u201cIf there was someone I was wildly concerned about I would let them know that I had a duty of care to speak to someone else about it.

Trainee numbers were low until the middle of this decade, when concerns over the sharp rise in the number of people presenting with mental distress prompted a response from business.

      "body": "<p>HSBC has been the bank that has prospered most from globalisation. Hong Kong has been its gateway to an emerging China, its UK domicile has provided regulatory and legal respectability, and its US operations have enabled it to become one of the biggest US dollar clearing banks in the world. But has globalisation now stopped working in the bank\u2019s favour?</p> <p>Hong Kong \u2013 where the bank makes about half its profit \u2013 is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/02/hong-kong-protests-students-boycott-classes-as-chinese-media-warns-end-is-coming\">gripped by street protests</a> at the same time as the US and China are engaged in a tariff war, while the UK is in a crisis of its own making. The surprise is that the bank\u2019s share price hasn\u2019t fallen further than it has. It\u2019s down 10% since last August, but that\u2019s rather better than Barclays or Lloyds, which have fallen even more steeply.</p> <p>What do banks do when things get a bit rough abroad? They go home and focus on their knitting. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ff4cddfc-ca55-11e9-a1f4-3669401ba76f?accessToken=zwAAAWzxsvkwkdP_TN38ylUR6dOh9DZpQBunbw.MEUCIQDOY9pMM9zMnconi64PuXpFRbWKHDQFmS7yhP0zsbKUqgIgAj3Kwee2tU4ovdjM4D9h1RvGL9N0tFK2rIIHaraoI8A&amp;sharetype=gift?token=c84616cc-a4f6-4643-80ef-f2ea51a19238\">In an interview with the FT</a>, HSBC UK chief executive Ian Stuart said it plans to expand mortgage lending in Britain to raise its market share to about 11%, implying an increase in its lending book of about \u00a335bn.</p> <p>HSBC has long been the sleeping giant of the UK mortgage market, with a share of loans currently about 6.5%, compared with 20% at Lloyds. It also has the financial might to drive down pricing, much to its competitors\u2019 ire. It is already at or near the top of the best-buy tables for first-time buyers wanting three- or five-year fixes, and also features strongly in the remortgaging best-buy tables.</p> <p>HSBC\u2019s expansion is good news for borrowers \u2013 its 2.29% on a five-year fix for first-time buyers is better than any other bank on the high street. Barclays is about the only major rival trying to keep up, slicing its rates in recent weeks to remain competitive.</p> <p>But this sort of competition is bad news for any bank\u2019s net interest margin \u2013 the difference between what it pays savers in interest on deposits and what it receives from borrowers.</p> <p>It\u2019s also bad news for savers. If HSBC\u2019s rivals try to compete, then they will also have to cut rates to savers to maintain their margins. Let\u2019s not rule out the possibility of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/06/raking-it-in-ubs-to-start-charging-super-rich-clients-for-cash-deposits\">interest rates going negative for savers in the UK as they are in parts of Europe</a>, with the yield on the 10-year gilt already below 0.5%.

      "bodyText": "HSBC has been the bank that has prospered most from globalisation. Hong Kong has been its gateway to an emerging China, its UK domicile has provided regulatory and legal respectability, and its US operations have enabled it to become one of the biggest US dollar clearing banks in the world. But has globalisation now stopped working in the bank\u2019s favour? Hong Kong \u2013 where the bank makes about half its profit \u2013 is gripped by street protests at the same time as the US and China are engaged in a tariff war, while the UK is in a crisis of its own making. The surprise is that the bank\u2019s share price hasn\u2019t fallen further than it has. It\u2019s down 10% since last August, but that\u2019s rather better than Barclays or Lloyds, which have fallen even more steeply. What do banks do when things get a bit rough abroad? They go home and focus on their knitting. In an interview with the FT, HSBC UK chief executive Ian Stuart said it plans to expand mortgage lending in Britain to raise its market share to about 11%, implying an increase in its lending book of about \u00a335bn. HSBC has long been the sleeping giant of the UK mortgage market, with a share of loans currently about 6.5%, compared with 20% at Lloyds. It also has the financial might to drive down pricing, much to its competitors\u2019 ire. It is already at or near the top of the best-buy tables for first-time buyers wanting three- or five-year fixes, and also features strongly in the remortgaging best-buy tables. HSBC\u2019s expansion is good news for borrowers \u2013 its 2.29% on a five-year fix for first-time buyers is better than any other bank on the high street. Barclays is about the only major rival trying to keep up, slicing its rates in recent weeks to remain competitive. But this sort of competition is bad news for any bank\u2019s net interest margin \u2013 the difference between what it pays savers in interest on deposits and what it receives from borrowers. It\u2019s also bad news for savers. If HSBC\u2019s rivals try to compete, then they will also have to cut rates to savers to maintain their margins. Let\u2019s not rule out the possibility of interest rates going negative for savers in the UK as they are in parts of Europe, with the yield on the 10-year gilt already below 0.5%. Other banks will also effectively pull out of the market, largely by leaving their rates high and seeing the business drain off to HSBC. Is it a smart move by HSBC? Focusing on Britain when Hong Kong is on fire makes sense. But an aggressive expansion into the UK mortgage market when transaction volumes are flat and house prices in the crucial London and south-east market are forecast to fall on a hard Brexit carries its own special risks. Borrowers should by all means grab these rates while they last. But it gives share buyers yet another reason not to hold bank shares.",

But the Australian changed his mind once he met a man whose commitment and integrity is illustrated by the fact that he has played for Harlequins, the club he supported as a boy, since joining their academy 16 years ago.</p> <p>Robshaw\u2019s face clouds a little when he remembers the last time he spoke to Jones, which was a few weeks ago. \u201cHe phoned me up and told me he was calling about selection. When Eddie calls you it\u2019s normally not good news. You know what\u2019s coming. But it\u2019s still never nice when he tells you you\u2019re not going to the World Cup. For me the last one didn\u2019t go well. I wanted to have another shot at it because you realise how special they are as tournaments. So it was extremely tough.\u201d</p> <p>He smiles, but with more than a hint of sadness. \u201cIt does feel like the end because, realistically, you\u2019re probably not going to play again. I\u2019m 33 now. But you get back on the horse and I went to Twickenham with Sky Sports to watch the England [World Cup warm-up] game. After it\u2019s over you feel tired. You\u2019ve seen your old teammates. You\u2019ve had a laugh with some of them. Eighty thousand people are there. You\u2019re on the pitch. This is what it\u2019s about. This is why you play the game. And now it\u2019s over. After that I was a bit down.\u201d</p> <p>Robshaw nods when I say he has still had a fine career, in which he has made the most of his ability. \u201cYou still always want more. But that\u2019s what people say when I have my sulk and down moments. I\u2019ve been very privileged to play so many times for my country. I\u2019ve played all over the world and been extremely honoured to have captained England more times than most.\u201d</p> <p>Robshaw led England in 43 Tests and only Will Carling has been captain more often than him. Even the great Martin Johnson captained England four times fewer than Robshaw. \u201cAs a kid I would never have dreamed of it. Even as a young professional I wouldn\u2019t ever have thought I\u2019d achieve that. When you look at it like that, you change your point of view. But if you\u2019ve got 70 caps, you want 80. You want to win another bit of silverware. You want to play in another Six Nations and one more World Cup. But you also realise how you\u2019ve benefited from everything and you come to peace with it somehow.\u201d</p> <p>A new season with Harlequins helps bring that peace. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/may/18/wasps-harlequins-premiership-rugby-union-match-report\" title=\"\">Robshaw has already reflected on how they missed the play-offs with the final kick of last season</a>, having been in the top four for most of the campaign, and why they expect to sustain their challenge this year. He is also thrilled to be leading Quins in the European Champions Cup as they return to the elite club competition after a long break. But I am curious to hear how Jones broke the news to him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"448abfb9a8bc54a188fcb39940bab80585ee1d89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/448abfb9a8bc54a188fcb39940bab80585ee1d89/1144_58_3369_2021/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Robshaw and James Haskell share a laugh at the Stade de France in Paris after England\u2019s Six Nations grand slam triumph in 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Robshaw and James Haskell share a laugh at the Stade de France in Paris after England\u2019s Six Nations grand slam triumph in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Seconds Left/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cEddie and I have always had a good relationship.

I wasn\u2019t playing as well, and you accept it as I\u2019m always quite realistic.

Robshaw has just finished lunch in Guildford and, after a sincere 15 minutes in which he has stressed his enthusiasm for a new rugby season as captain of his beloved club, Harlequins, he admits the old heartbreak. Robshaw won 66 caps, a grand slam and was a key part of a world record-equalling run of 18 successive Test victories but he will also be remembered as England\u2019s captain in their painful 2015 World Cup. Exactly four years ago he was about to lead England into a tournament on home soil. Serious hope and giddy anticipation soon turned to dust as England did not even make it out of their group after losing against Wales and Australia at Twickenham. The scars remain for Robshaw. It says much about his character and resilience that, rather than being banished from international duty then, Robshaw not only held on to his place but emerged as a crucial figure in the first three years of Jones\u2019s tenure as England head coach. Jones had dismissed Robshaw as an average player at the previous World Cup.

      "bodyText": "HSBC is to lend an extra \u00a335bn to homeowners, further intensifying the battle among mortgage lenders to offer ultra-competitive deals to customers. The bank, which began its drive to become a major force in the British mortgage market in 2014 and currently has about \u00a3100bn in loans on its books, is aiming to expand from an estimated 7% to about 11% of the UK market. Rivals have claimed that HSBC\u2019s aggressive push into the mortgage market will squeeze profit margins in the sector amid intense competition for customers. The result has been a boon to mortgage hunters seeking good deals but has forced some lenders, such as Tesco Bank and the consumer body Which?, to quit the mortgage market. However, Ian Stuart, the HSBC UK chief executive, told the Financial Times that it was not fair to lay the blame at its door as it remains a relative minnow in the mortgage market, with 6.4% at the end of last year. This compares with Lloyds Banking Group which enjoys a 20% share, Nationwide 13% and Santander UK just over 11%, according to UK Finance, the trade body for UK banks and financial services companies. \u201cThere are many critics, usually other banks, saying that we are being overly competitive in the market, and we are desperately trying to get share,\u201d said Stuart. The number of new home loan deals that offer some sort of incentive to pull in customers, such as cashback, free valuation or free legal fees, have risen sharply as competition has intensified. In May, the financial data provider Moneyfacts.co.uk said there were 1,518 mortgages offering an added incentive, significantly up from the 920 in the same month in 2017. Stuart said the bank\u2019s mortgage strategy was based on efficiency and customer service, not just attempting to out-price rivals with cheaper deals. \u201cRather than taking seven weeks to get a mortgage, it now takes you about five days \u2013 that\u2019s pretty slick,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a price-driven strategy; it\u2019s a good quality products, well executed strategy.\u201d",

Saturday night\u2019s events in K\u00f6penick, in the south-east of Berlin, didn\u2019t just rock Union, or football in the capital, but the whole of Germany. In Union\u2019s debut season among the elite, it hasn\u2019t taken them long to make an indelible mark that threatens to change projections not only for their season, but for the Bundesliga\u2019s as a whole.</p> \n<p>It wasn\u2019t just that Urs Fischer\u2019s side registered their first top-flight win, when on Saturday morning you\u2019d have been forgiven for casting your eyes down their forthcoming fixtures and wondering how they might find a way of getting it before autumn set in. It wasn\u2019t even that their victims were Borussia Dortmund, thought by many to be ready for an even sturdier push for the Bundesliga title following last season\u2019s near miss.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/btsportfootball/status/1168056361428684800\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">WHAT.

In Union\u2019s case, the planning was clear in the execution, with Christopher Trimmel\u2019s pulled-back corner swept in by Marius B\u00fclter, Darren Anderton to Teddy Sheringham-style, to give the hosts the lead.</p> \n<p>Last Friday Dortmund had toughed it out, and eventually ground down and outclassed an exhausted K\u00f6ln. Although Paco Alc\u00e1cer\u2019s equaliser had suggested they would do the same and prevail at the Alte F\u00f6rsterei, Union simply wouldn\u2019t have it. There was only one team in it after the interval. B\u00fclter gave them the lead back with another wonderfully crafted finish before Sebastian Andersson, who had scored the team\u2019s first-ever Bundesliga goal at Augsburg last week, doubled up with a smart, side-footed finish from Sheraldo Becker\u2019s cross. The visitors rarely looked like getting back into it.</p> \n<p>This wasn\u2019t totally without precedent. Union had been the better side for swathes of last week\u2019s match at Augsburg, before Keven Schlotterbeck\u2019s late red card made them change tack and settle for a point. Still, few would have predicted that the green shoots in Bavaria would bloom so quickly.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Saturday was, to all intents and purposes, Union\u2019s first proper stab hosting a grown-up Bundesliga dinner party. The opening day against Leipzig had represented a torrent of feelings from so many different directions, from fans brandishing images of late friends and relatives who couldn\u2019t be there to the protest against the visitors and what they are perceived to stand for during the game\u2019s first 15 minutes. They were extraordinary, arresting sights and coupled with playing elite opposition in a huge step up, it was just too much. The match \u2013 and its context - was \u201cemotionally overloaded\u201d, as F\u00e4rber put it.</p> \n<p>This time, they were ready. Union kept 14 clean sheets in the Bundesliga 2 last season and while the level is a different one, the grit in the team\u2019s DNA is clear. Not that Fischer should be described as purely a defensive coach. This is a man who spent his last job before coming to Germany winning championships with Basel and if Lucien Favre picked a top-heavy line-up committed to taking to the points from K\u00f6penick, Fischer showed his guts by pairing Andersson with Anthony Ujah. Two up top against one of the favourites for the Bundesliga? \u201c<em>Nehmt euer herz in beide h\u00e4nde</em>!\u201d (take your heart in both hands), the buzzphrase for the promotion/relegation play-off with Stuttgart had said, and it was present on fans\u2019 T-shirts dotted around on Saturday, which were given away pre-kick-off. Their players and staff appeared keen to honour the motto.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b63bf70646e47d0672301b03071e1e601353bfb\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b63bf70646e47d0672301b03071e1e601353bfb/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Union\u2019s Sebastian Andersson celebrates with his teammates after making it 3-1.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Union\u2019s Sebastian Andersson celebrates with his teammates after making it 3-1.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sascha Steinbach/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Ujah, Christian Gentner and Neven Suboti\u0107 promise to be key figures for Union this season, a sizeable pinch of top-flight experience added to the mix of first-timers; goalscorer B\u00fclter was playing in the fourth tier for R\u00f6dinghausen little more than a year ago. None was more important against Dortmund than Suboti\u0107 on what was an emotional day for him, facing the club he went through so much with during a decade at Westfalen; titles, a Champions League final (famously alongside Mats Hummels, who he faced here) and a serious knee injury that severely compromised his best level.</p> \n<p>After 18 months at Saint-\u00c9tienne, the 30-year-old is looking more like his old self in slightly more modest surroundings. It\u2019s early but the signs are good. Since Suboti\u0107 has been installed in the starting XI \u2013 he was an unused sub on the opening day against Leipzig \u2013 Union have looked tough to break down. Fischer and the team will hope his renaissance continues.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Bundesliga_EN/status/1167934590557638657\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NSubotic4?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@NSubotic4</a> sums it up nicely \ud83d\ude0a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/FCUBVB?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#FCUBVB</a> 3-1 <a href=\"https://t.co/rXKO8id1Bm\">pic.twitter.com/rXKO8id1Bm</a></p>\u2014 Bundesliga English (@Bundesliga_EN) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Bundesliga_EN/status/1167934590557638657?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 31, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>As a clearly touched Suboti\u0107 received a warm reception from both sets of fans at the game\u2019s conclusion, it was hard to think of anywhere he\u2019d rather be, and the same might be said for many neutrals, drinking in such a rich atmosphere. \u201cIt\u2019s what makes both clubs special,\u201d Suboti\u0107 told Deutsche Welle. \u201cFor the fans it\u2019s not a hobby. It\u2019s part of their life and identity.\u201d We already knew, from a few early impressions, what Union were adding to the Bundesliga.

They trailed for half-an-hour at home to Mainz, but still ended up 6-1 winners, with players other than the Pole getting on the scoresheet for the first time this season in the Bundesliga. Niko Kova\u010d\u2019s hand in proceedings was also clear \u2013 Joshua Kimmich and Niklas S\u00fcle both said the coach\u2019s pep talk during a first-half water break had provided the kick into gear that Bayern needed, in a week when Uli Hoeness and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge\u2019s forthcoming exits were made official.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/btsportfootball/status/1167813185690374145\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">David Alaba finds the postage stamp with a sublime free-kick \ud83d\ude0d<br><br>Perfect placement, perfect timing for Bayern! <a href=\"https://t.co/YaMjbaHiQz\">pic.twitter.com/YaMjbaHiQz</a></p>\u2014 Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/btsportfootball/status/1167813185690374145?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 31, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>\u2022 Leipzig are now the only team left with a 100% record after Timo Werner\u2019s sensational hat-trick secured a Friday night win at M\u00f6nchengladbach.

      "bodyText": "\u201cBerlin\u2019s football world,\u201d wrote Berliner Morgenpost\u2019s Michael F\u00e4rber on Sunday morning, \u201cis upside down.\u201d A look at the fledgling Bundesliga suggests as much, with Union in comfortable mid-table, a position they would give their eye teeth to be in come the end of the campaign, with Hertha only kept off the foot of the table by Mainz, who are yet to register a point. That\u2019s not it though \u2013 and not just because tables are of limited relevance three games into the season. Saturday night\u2019s events in K\u00f6penick, in the south-east of Berlin, didn\u2019t just rock Union, or football in the capital, but the whole of Germany. In Union\u2019s debut season among the elite, it hasn\u2019t taken them long to make an indelible mark that threatens to change projections not only for their season, but for the Bundesliga\u2019s as a whole. It wasn\u2019t just that Urs Fischer\u2019s side registered their first top-flight win, when on Saturday morning you\u2019d have been forgiven for casting your eyes down their forthcoming fixtures and wondering how they might find a way of getting it before autumn set in. It wasn\u2019t even that their victims were Borussia Dortmund, thought by many to be ready for an even sturdier push for the Bundesliga title following last season\u2019s near miss. It was that this was a win that wasn\u2019t stolen, not feverishly clutched while under siege, but deserved. \u201cThe manner of the win pleased me the most,\u201d said Fischer. Before the break \u2013 a performance that, interestingly, the coach was underwhelmed by \u2013 his team had played with the punch and defiance of a newly-promoted underdog, spritely and dangerous from set-pieces. Dortmund had been through similar the week before at K\u00f6ln, caught on the hop by the home side\u2019s lack of deference. In Union\u2019s case, the planning was clear in the execution, with Christopher Trimmel\u2019s pulled-back corner swept in by Marius B\u00fclter, Darren Anderton to Teddy Sheringham-style, to give the hosts the lead. Last Friday Dortmund had toughed it out, and eventually ground down and outclassed an exhausted K\u00f6ln. Although Paco Alc\u00e1cer\u2019s equaliser had suggested they would do the same and prevail at the Alte F\u00f6rsterei, Union simply wouldn\u2019t have it. There was only one team in it after the interval. B\u00fclter gave them the lead back with another wonderfully crafted finish before Sebastian Andersson, who had scored the team\u2019s first-ever Bundesliga goal at Augsburg last week, doubled up with a smart, side-footed finish from Sheraldo Becker\u2019s cross. The visitors rarely looked like getting back into it. This wasn\u2019t totally without precedent. Union had been the better side for swathes of last week\u2019s match at Augsburg, before Keven Schlotterbeck\u2019s late red card made them change tack and settle for a point. Still, few would have predicted that the green shoots in Bavaria would bloom so quickly. Saturday was, to all intents and purposes, Union\u2019s first proper stab hosting a grown-up Bundesliga dinner party. The opening day against Leipzig had represented a torrent of feelings from so many different directions, from fans brandishing images of late friends and relatives who couldn\u2019t be there to the protest against the visitors and what they are perceived to stand for during the game\u2019s first 15 minutes. They were extraordinary, arresting sights and coupled with playing elite opposition in a huge step up, it was just too much. The match \u2013 and its context - was \u201cemotionally overloaded\u201d, as F\u00e4rber put it. This time, they were ready. Union kept 14 clean sheets in the Bundesliga 2 last season and while the level is a different one, the grit in the team\u2019s DNA is clear. Not that Fischer should be described as purely a defensive coach. This is a man who spent his last job before coming to Germany winning championships with Basel and if Lucien Favre picked a top-heavy line-up committed to taking to the points from K\u00f6penick, Fischer showed his guts by pairing Andersson with Anthony Ujah. Two up top against one of the favourites for the Bundesliga? \u201cNehmt euer herz in beide h\u00e4nde!\u201d (take your heart in both hands), the buzzphrase for the promotion/relegation play-off with Stuttgart had said, and it was present on fans\u2019 T-shirts dotted around on Saturday, which were given away pre-kick-off. Their players and staff appeared keen to honour the motto. Ujah, Christian Gentner and Neven Suboti\u0107 promise to be key figures for Union this season, a sizeable pinch of top-flight experience added to the mix of first-timers; goalscorer B\u00fclter was playing in the fourth tier for R\u00f6dinghausen little more than a year ago. None was more important against Dortmund than Suboti\u0107 on what was an emotional day for him, facing the club he went through so much with during a decade at Westfalen; titles, a Champions League final (famously alongside Mats Hummels, who he faced here) and a serious knee injury that severely compromised his best level. After 18 months at Saint-\u00c9tienne, the 30-year-old is looking more like his old self in slightly more modest surroundings. It\u2019s early but the signs are good. Since Suboti\u0107 has been installed in the starting XI \u2013 he was an unused sub on the opening day against Leipzig \u2013 Union have looked tough to break down. Fischer and the team will hope his renaissance continues. As a clearly touched Suboti\u0107 received a warm reception from both sets of fans at the game\u2019s conclusion, it was hard to think of anywhere he\u2019d rather be, and the same might be said for many neutrals, drinking in such a rich atmosphere. \u201cIt\u2019s what makes both clubs special,\u201d Suboti\u0107 told Deutsche Welle. \u201cFor the fans it\u2019s not a hobby. It\u2019s part of their life and identity.\u201d We already knew, from a few early impressions, what Union were adding to the Bundesliga. Now they\u2019ve shown us that there\u2019s a football team beyond the ideology. Talking points \u2022 While Dortmund struggled without the guiding hand of the injured Axel Witsel, Bayern took a week off leaning solely on Robert Lewandowski. They trailed for half-an-hour at home to Mainz, but still ended up 6-1 winners, with players other than the Pole getting on the scoresheet for the first time this season in the Bundesliga. Niko Kova\u010d\u2019s hand in proceedings was also clear \u2013 Joshua Kimmich and Niklas S\u00fcle both said the coach\u2019s pep talk during a first-half water break had provided the kick into gear that Bayern needed, in a week when Uli Hoeness and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge\u2019s forthcoming exits were made official. \u2022 Leipzig are now the only team left with a 100% record after Timo Werner\u2019s sensational hat-trick secured a Friday night win at M\u00f6nchengladbach. They\u2019re serious. \u2022 One wondered how Schalke would score. Then Hertha donated two own goals to help them towards David Wagner\u2019s first win. Elsewhere, the indomitable Bas Dost scored 11 minutes into his Bundesliga return to help Eintracht Frankfurt towards victory over Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf.",

It is an oversight that is easily resolved, thanks to beans in tins, but the problem with those is that you don\u2019t score the cooking water \u2013 the cloudy, sort-of-broth that is not so much flavoured as it is bean-tinted, and slightly thickened with starch that has leeched from the beans as they cook. For many recipes, this cooking water is as much an ingredient as the beans themselves, giving starchy substance and a leg-up in gentle flavour. Of course, you can always find a way if you do use tins, but it is never quite the same as that cloudy bonus.</p> <p>Despite having left a packet of beans in clear sight, I ignored them for two days, only remembering on the third when I tried to put a dish on top of them. We are still in Sicily, in what was my partner\u2019s grandparents\u2019 house: a time capsule where furniture, photos, utensils, farming equipment in the garage, hollows in the terrazzo flooring and Martini from 1979 feel like portals into another time. Thankfully <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/aug/12/rachel-roddy-palermo-salad-recipe\" title=\"\">the water is back on</a>, meaning it arrives in our side of the city every two days, seeping through the cracks in the road so we know to turn the motor on, which sucks 1,000 litres through the pipe that runs like a vein up the side of the house into a tank on the roof, noisily. The two long disruptions in the water supply this summer have turned me into a calculator: one and a half litres to soak the beans, one and a half more to cook them.</p> <p>I have changed my mind about beans over the years. Having initially pooh-poohed the idea, I now add a scant half-teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda to the soaking water, whatever the bean. While chickpeas need longer, cannellini need 12-15 hours. I always use new water for simmering, adding a teaspoon of salt to it, which does not, as I once believed, toughen the skins. It\u2019s quite the opposite in fact: it softens them and salts the cooking water, too.</p> <p>Dried beans are also good value (most of the time), especially cannellini: 500g dried more than doubles in volume to just over a kilo when cooked, which is just the right amount for these three summer bean recipes. The bean cooking liquid is also a preserver: leave the remaining beans immersed in it in the fridge, lifting them out with a slotted spoon as you need them.</p> <p>First things first though: remember to soak.</p> <h2><strong>White beans three ways (clams and broth; tuna and onion; courgette, lemon and herbs)</strong></h2> <p>500g dried/soaked beans produce about 1kg cooked ones, so there will be enough for all three recipes, which all serve two as a main, or four as a side dish.

Drain, cover with fresh water, add a pinch of salt, a bay leaf and a clove of garlic. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer for an hour, or until the beans are tender.</p> <h2>For beans with clams</h2> <p>This first recipe is for beans and clams, which, like spaghetti and clams, is a favourite among favourites. In Gela, where there is a man selling tiny, clam-like <em>telline</em> on every street corner, they are also used for this dish. This should be a brothy dish \u2013 one that requires a spoon, a slurp and some bread to soak up the sea-salty juices.</p> <p><strong>500g clams or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donax_trunculus\" title=\"\">telline</a><br>Olive oil<br>1-2 garlic cloves,</strong> peeled and sliced<br><strong>150ml white wine</strong><br><strong>1 shallot</strong>, peeled and diced small<br><strong>1 stick of celery</strong>, diced small<br><strong>Salt<br>350g cooked beans<br>Chopped parsley</strong></p> <p>Soak the clams or telline in lightly salted water for an hour, to leech out any sand trapped inside.</p> <p>In a large frying pan with a lid, warm four tablespoons of olive oil and the garlic. Add the clams, shake the pan, raise the heat, add the white wine and cover, shaking the pan until the clams have opened.</p> <p>If you are worried about sand, remove the clams, set aside and filter the liquid. You want about 100ml of deeply flavoured clam liquid so, if you have more, reduce by boiling.</p> <p>In another pan, fry the chopped shallot and celery in olive oil with a pinch of salt until soft. Add a ladleful of bean cooking water, the beans and stir. Add the clams and the rest of the clam cooking water and bubble for a few minutes \u2013 it should be nice and brothy, so add more bean broth if it needs it.</p> <p>Finish with a handful of parsley and serve with toasted or fried bread.</p> <h2>Beans with with tuna and onion</h2> <p>This suggestion, for the second batch is a summer standard.

Such abusive mendacity is no help. Johnson knows perfectly well that millions of people who voted to leave the EU did not vote for arbitrarily timed border chaos. They voted for what he and his friends promised: negotiated Brexit with frictionless trade. So did he. He also voted for Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement.

      "body": "<p>Juventus\u2019s first home game of the new season had already kicked off by the time Giorgio Chiellini arrived behind the dugouts at the Allianz Stadium. He raised an arm to acknowledge supporters singing his name, but needed both hands on his crutches as he lowered himself into his seat, trying not to place too much weight on a heavily strapped right knee.</p> \n<p>Chiellini had ruptured his cruciate ligament in training one day before. A painful personal setback, and a potential catastrophe for his team. The Juventus captain is expected to be out of action for at least the next five months. For a 35-year-old footballer, such injuries can curtail a career.</p> \n<p>His absence from the starting XI to face Napoli on Saturday was already a major setback. These were the champions\u2019 closest rivals: the team that finished as runners-up in three of the past four seasons. Juventus were still adjusting to life under a new manager, Maurizio Sarri, who was unable to take up his own place on the touchline after contracting pneumonia in pre-season.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/01/luis-albertos-strike-earns-lazio-a-point-in-lively-rome-derby\">Antonio Conte calls for action after Cagliari fans racially abuse Lukaku</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It ought to have been a vulnerable moment for Italian football\u2019s Old Lady. But sometimes <em>La Vecchia Signora</em> looks an awful lot like the Roman goddess <em>Fortuna</em> \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/31/juventus-napoli-serie-a-match-report\">the original Lady Luck</a>.</p> \n<p>Juventus opened the scoring in the 16th minute through summer recruit Danilo, who had only stepped on the pitch moments earlier as a replacement for the injured Mattia De Sciglio.</p> \n<p>Of course, the goal was not all down to chance. Napoli were negligent, conceding from their own corner. Lorenzo Insigne\u2019s shot was blocked by Leonardo Bonucci, and his teammates were too slow to react as Danilo released Douglas Costa on the counter before arriving in the penalty box to convert the return pass. He had been on the pitch for 29 seconds in this, his Juventus debut.</p> \n<p>Defence was supposed to be a strength for Napoli this season, after they signed Kostas Manolas to play alongside Kalidou Koulibaly at centre-back. Yet the latter player was left flat-footed as Gonzalo Higua\u00edn made it 2-0 with a sharp turn and finish moments later. The game looked to be up when Cristiano Ronaldo added a third shortly after the hour mark.</p> \n<p>Instead, Napoli would drag themselves back level during a remarkable 15-minute burst, then throw all their hard work away in injury time. Manolas headed in from a free-kick, before Hirving Lozano \u2013 making his own debut as a second-half substitute \u2013 slotted home from a Jos\u00e9 Callej\u00f3n cross. Carlo Ancelotti raised both eyebrows as Giovanni Di Lorenzo arrived at the back post on another set-piece. Suddenly, the score was 3-3.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"202072738d234ec90697c8958feac6f90bfdbfd6\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/202072738d234ec90697c8958feac6f90bfdbfd6/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Giorgio Chiellini watches from the sidelines in Turin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Giorgio Chiellini watches from the sidelines in Turin.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Isabella Bonotto/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The comeback narrative was laced with juicy subplots. Chiellini\u2019s replacement, the \u20ac75m summer signing Matthijs De Ligt, had endured a calamitous debut: losing his man on all three of Napoli\u2019s goals. We can be lenient in our judgements of a 20-year-old defender playing in a new team and an unfamiliar league, while still acknowledging that the captain is going to be missed.</p> \n<p>Juve\u2019s best player was Higua\u00edn, a defining figure in the recent rivalry between these two clubs. Sarri\u2019s first title challenge with Napoli was built on the striker\u2019s record-breaking 2015-16 campaign, before the Argentinian joined the <em>Bianconeri</em>. The goals he scored over the next two seasons were crucial to keeping the Scudetto out of his former manager\u2019s hands.</p> \n<p>Now their fates are once again intertwined. Few people expected Higua\u00edn to have a role at Juventus following disappointing loan spells at Milan and Chelsea, yet he started at centre-forward on Saturday just as he had on the opening weekend. Even before scoring, he had created problems for Koulibaly with intelligent movement outside the penalty box. He teed up Sami Khedira for a golden chance that went begging at 2-0, as well.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>At one point, Higua\u00edn was applauded even for a missed pass, because fans recognised his intent. A louder ovation was offered when he came off in the 76th minute.</p> \n<p>Di Lorenzo\u2019s equaliser arrived soon after, but there was a further twist yet to come. In injury time, Juventus won a free-kick 40 yards from goal. Their own players barely reacted as Miralem Pjanic heaved a last hopeful ball into the Napoli box. Koulibaly, however, attacked it decisively at the near post. The ball caught his shin and flew into the top corner of the net.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1167900726619586560\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Kalidou Koulibaly with an own goal in stoppage time! \ud83e\udd2f<br><br>You couldn't make it up \ud83d\ude33<br><br>UNBELIEVABLE!!<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SerieA?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#SerieA</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/2OH13SUrlU\">pic.twitter.com/2OH13SUrlU</a></p>\u2014 Premier Sports \ud83d\udcfa (@PremierSportsTV) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1167900726619586560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 31, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>It was a freakish mistake that capped a night to forget for a player who has known the very different emotion of scoring a 90th-minute winner for his own team at the Allianz Stadium. Koulibaly was Serie A\u2019s best centre-back last season, but this was an occasion when \u2013 with Chiellini watching from the stands \u2013 both teams forgot how to defend.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/10/premier-league-la-liga-bundesliga-serie-a-and-ligue-1-top-scorers-2019-20\">Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A and Ligue 1 top scorers 2019-20</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The Juventus captain came down on his crutches to console his opponent after the final whistle: a show of empathy from one great player to another. \u201cI used to hate him,\u201d confessed Sarri\u2019s No 2, Giovanni Martusciello. \u201cBecause playing against us he was a real ball-buster.

They can draw plenty of encouragement from an early win over a direct rival, but for a team that only conceded 13 goals at home last season to ship three in their first game without Chiellini ought to set alarm bells ringing as well. There is little that feels settled about a team whose new manager has thus far been forced to work at arm\u2019s length.

      "bodyText": "Juventus\u2019s first home game of the new season had already kicked off by the time Giorgio Chiellini arrived behind the dugouts at the Allianz Stadium. He raised an arm to acknowledge supporters singing his name, but needed both hands on his crutches as he lowered himself into his seat, trying not to place too much weight on a heavily strapped right knee. Chiellini had ruptured his cruciate ligament in training one day before. A painful personal setback, and a potential catastrophe for his team. The Juventus captain is expected to be out of action for at least the next five months. For a 35-year-old footballer, such injuries can curtail a career. His absence from the starting XI to face Napoli on Saturday was already a major setback. These were the champions\u2019 closest rivals: the team that finished as runners-up in three of the past four seasons. Juventus were still adjusting to life under a new manager, Maurizio Sarri, who was unable to take up his own place on the touchline after contracting pneumonia in pre-season. It ought to have been a vulnerable moment for Italian football\u2019s Old Lady. But sometimes La Vecchia Signora looks an awful lot like the Roman goddess Fortuna \u2013 the original Lady Luck. Juventus opened the scoring in the 16th minute through summer recruit Danilo, who had only stepped on the pitch moments earlier as a replacement for the injured Mattia De Sciglio. Of course, the goal was not all down to chance. Napoli were negligent, conceding from their own corner. Lorenzo Insigne\u2019s shot was blocked by Leonardo Bonucci, and his teammates were too slow to react as Danilo released Douglas Costa on the counter before arriving in the penalty box to convert the return pass. He had been on the pitch for 29 seconds in this, his Juventus debut. Defence was supposed to be a strength for Napoli this season, after they signed Kostas Manolas to play alongside Kalidou Koulibaly at centre-back. Yet the latter player was left flat-footed as Gonzalo Higua\u00edn made it 2-0 with a sharp turn and finish moments later. The game looked to be up when Cristiano Ronaldo added a third shortly after the hour mark. Instead, Napoli would drag themselves back level during a remarkable 15-minute burst, then throw all their hard work away in injury time. Manolas headed in from a free-kick, before Hirving Lozano \u2013 making his own debut as a second-half substitute \u2013 slotted home from a Jos\u00e9 Callej\u00f3n cross. Carlo Ancelotti raised both eyebrows as Giovanni Di Lorenzo arrived at the back post on another set-piece. Suddenly, the score was 3-3. The comeback narrative was laced with juicy subplots. Chiellini\u2019s replacement, the \u20ac75m summer signing Matthijs De Ligt, had endured a calamitous debut: losing his man on all three of Napoli\u2019s goals. We can be lenient in our judgements of a 20-year-old defender playing in a new team and an unfamiliar league, while still acknowledging that the captain is going to be missed. Juve\u2019s best player was Higua\u00edn, a defining figure in the recent rivalry between these two clubs. Sarri\u2019s first title challenge with Napoli was built on the striker\u2019s record-breaking 2015-16 campaign, before the Argentinian joined the Bianconeri. The goals he scored over the next two seasons were crucial to keeping the Scudetto out of his former manager\u2019s hands. Now their fates are once again intertwined. Few people expected Higua\u00edn to have a role at Juventus following disappointing loan spells at Milan and Chelsea, yet he started at centre-forward on Saturday just as he had on the opening weekend. Even before scoring, he had created problems for Koulibaly with intelligent movement outside the penalty box. He teed up Sami Khedira for a golden chance that went begging at 2-0, as well. At one point, Higua\u00edn was applauded even for a missed pass, because fans recognised his intent. A louder ovation was offered when he came off in the 76th minute. Di Lorenzo\u2019s equaliser arrived soon after, but there was a further twist yet to come. In injury time, Juventus won a free-kick 40 yards from goal. Their own players barely reacted as Miralem Pjanic heaved a last hopeful ball into the Napoli box. Koulibaly, however, attacked it decisively at the near post. The ball caught his shin and flew into the top corner of the net. It was a freakish mistake that capped a night to forget for a player who has known the very different emotion of scoring a 90th-minute winner for his own team at the Allianz Stadium. Koulibaly was Serie A\u2019s best centre-back last season, but this was an occasion when \u2013 with Chiellini watching from the stands \u2013 both teams forgot how to defend. The Juventus captain came down on his crutches to console his opponent after the final whistle: a show of empathy from one great player to another. \u201cI used to hate him,\u201d confessed Sarri\u2019s No 2, Giovanni Martusciello. \u201cBecause playing against us he was a real ball-buster. But I have got to know an extraordinary lad \u2026 after the injury, he was the one who gave us courage.\u201d Juventus will need more than just that to win a ninth consecutive Scudetto. They can draw plenty of encouragement from an early win over a direct rival, but for a team that only conceded 13 goals at home last season to ship three in their first game without Chiellini ought to set alarm bells ringing as well. There is little that feels settled about a team whose new manager has thus far been forced to work at arm\u2019s length. With Antonio Contes Inter sitting alongside them at the top and Napoli boasting plenty of room for growth, there is much that feels unfamiliar yet. Talking points \u2022 A new campaign, but the same grim story at Cagliari, where Romelu Lukaku was targeted with racist abuse \u2013 just as Moise Kean was last season and Blaise Matuidi the year before. At least this time we did not hear any Inter players seek to apportion blame to their teammate. But what should we expect, given that no punishment was handed down to Cagliari for the previous incident \u2013 after which the club\u2019s president, Tommaso Giulini, rejected all accusations of racism and accused the media of false moralising? \u2022 Two goals in two games for Lukaku. His was not an especially well-rounded performance, but he did help win the penalty, which he converted, with his through-ball for Stefano Sensi. \u2022 A surreal Rome derby on Sunday, with the two teams combining to hit the woodwork six times \u2013 and five in the first 25 minutes alone. Lazio were better and look more ready to challenge for the top four. Joaqu\u00edn Correa and Ciro Immobile are ever more comfortable, and dangerous, as a front two. But Roma are great fun to watch under Paulo Fonseca. \u2022 Level with Juventus and Inter are Torino. Walter Mazzarri\u2019s team bounced back impressively from their Europa League exit by recovering from 2-1 down to win at Atalanta. \u2022 An eye-catching win for Sassuolo, too, who thrashed Sampdoria 4-1. Samp, of course, managed by their former manager Eusebio Di Francesco \u2026",

The striker has been deemed surplus to requirements at the London Stadium after the arrivals of S\u00e9bastien Haller and Albian Ajeti. Hern\u00e1ndez joined West Ham two summers ago from Bayer Leverkusen for \u00a316m and scored 17 goals, the most recent in the draw with Brighton in the second game of this season. The 31-year-old has not played since, with Haller and Andriy Yarmolenko emerging Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s preferred strike partnership. Both scored in Saturday\u2019s 2-0 win at home to Norwich. Matteo Darmian has completed his move from Manchester United to Parma for \u20ac1.5m (\u00a31.4m). \u201cEveryone at Manchester United would like to thank Matteo for his service and wish him all the best for the future,\u201d the club said in a statement.

In an English language editorial on Sunday, the Xinhua state news agency said \u201cthe end is coming for those attempting to disrupt Hong Kong and antagonise China\u201d.

      "bodyText": "A British charity founded by a disgraced Buddhist guru, who died last week after he was accused of sexual misconduct towards some of his followers, faces further controversy after it emerged that one of its trustees was found responsible for covering up abuse. Patrick Gaffney was a trustee of the Rigpa Fellowship, which was founded by the Tibetan guru Sogyal Lakar, known as Sogyal Rinpoche, who died aged 72 in Thailand on Wednesday after going into hiding following the claims. Weeks before Lakar\u2019s death, Gaffney \u2013 the guru\u2019s right-hand man who co-edited his bestselling The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying \u2013 was banned by a watchdog from working with charities for eight years. The British devotee, 70, who Lakar described as \u201cone of my oldest and closest students\u201d after the pair met at Cambridge University in 1970, faced the sanction after an inquiry by the Charity Commission. According to the Times, the watchdog uncovered evidence that Gaffney had \u201cknowledge of instances and allegations of improper acts and sexual and physical abuse against students\u201d. Announcing its decision in June, the commission said: \u201cMr Gaffney failed to take appropriate action in response to this information and is therefore responsible for misconduct and/or mismanagement in the administration of the charity.\u201d Amy Spiller, the head of the commission\u2019s investigations team, said: \u201cWe are continuing to investigate concerns about this charity via our ongoing statutory inquiry. However, the safety and wellbeing of beneficiaries and those that come into contact with the charity must always be a priority for the trustees and staff of a charity. This trustee has been disqualified with immediate effect for failing in his duty to protect those who came into contact with the charity.\u201d Celebrity readers of Lakar\u2019s book included the Radiohead singer, Thom Yorke, and the actor John Cleese. The Rigpa Fellowship announced Lakar\u2019s death, which came after complications during his cancer treatment, with \u201cdeep sadness\u201d on its website. Lakar founded the fellowship, which runs a Buddhist centre in Islington, north London, in 1979. Lakar served as the charity\u2019s spiritual director before he \u201cretired\u201d in August 2017 following the allegations. Gaffney was appointed to the charity\u2019s \u201cvisionary board\u201d after Lakar stood down. The charity, which runs courses and seminars, has centres around the world including in Birmingham, Manchester and Edinburgh. An investigation conducted by the legal firm Lewis Silkin, commissioned by the fellowship, concluded last year that \u201csome students of Sogyal Lakar \u2026 have been subjected to serious physical, sexual and emotional abuse by him\u201d. It added that \u201cthere were senior individuals within Rigpa who were aware of at least some of these issues and failed to address them, leaving others at risk\u201d. The fellowship said: \u201cPatrick Gaffney was a trustee of the English charity but resigned last year. We have adopted a new grievance procedure that includes an independent council, who can receive complaints brought by members and the public.\u201d",

By the time he does, we already know as much. Laura has told us all about the intense pain, and agonising surgical procedures she has endured for years, thanks to the swellings, ulcers and related problems in her uterus. She has also spent most of her life plagued by allergies: \u201cAs a child I was always in the hospital \u2013 asthma, allergic to more and more things, wheezing, coughing, itching, always a bellyache for some reason or another. My test results were always borderlining something dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>There is no cure for endometriosis. As that none-too-gentle surgeon says: \u201cWe know what happens but we don\u2019t know the causes; we can\u2019t stop it. Too much surgery makes it worse, the medications regulate it only partially and have bad side effects, but if we don\u2019t treat it, you\u2019ll get worse every month.\u201d</p> <p>So that\u2019s Laura\u2019s fate. \u201cI was an endless receptacle for pain,\u201d she says \u2013 and Please Read This Leaflet Carefully duly details that pain, surgery to alleviate the agony, then more pain, worry about pain, visits to the doctor, and pain again \u2026</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2019/aug/26/not-the-booker-skin-by-luke-brown-review-dystopian-fun-that-veers-into-silliness\">Not the Booker: Skin by Liam Brown review \u2013 dystopian fun that veers into silliness</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Many books about illness have definite end points: cure or death. A chronic disease is different. For Havelin\u2019s narrator, it\u2019s always ongoing and ever present, even if there are peaks and troughs. But we get a sense of the way the illness has progressed as Havelin moves backwards through Laura\u2019s life. We start in New York, where she often struggles to navigate daily tasks. On bad days, even commuting to work and shopping can push her to the verge of total exhaustion. Touching her baby\u2019s skin can bring her out in a rash. Then we see her as she first moved to the city, followed by her decision to leave her native Norway after long periods of illness - and so on, into her teenage years where she is already all too familiar with physical debilitation, but also training to be a figure skater.</p> <p>By the time we get to this end point we realise both how far Laura has come, and how much of her destiny has been dictated by illness. She notes with bitterness the people who prescribe that we should all \u201ctake complete responsibility\u201d for our lives, \u201cas if the external forces don\u2019t matter at all\u201d. For Laura, there\u2019s no escaping such forces. And her kind of \u201chopelessly under-researched female misery\u201d is not uncommon \u2013 and almost certainly wouldn\u2019t be so under-researched if men had to endure it themselves. Out of the necessary solipsism of illness emerges an empathetic picture of the way endometriosis has blighted millions of lives. It\u2019s been estimated that up to <a href=\"http://endometriosis.org/resources/articles/facts-about-endometriosis/\">one in </a><a href=\"http://endometriosis.org/resources/articles/facts-about-endometriosis/\">10 women will suffer from it during their reproductive years</a>. That\u2019s about 146 million people right now \u2013 although it\u2019s still depressingly difficult to know precise numbers, because the disease is so often misdiagnosed, dismissed and misunderstood.</p> <p>Havelin was diagnosed with endometriosis <a href=\"https://themillions.com/2019/05/please-read-this-interview-carefully-karen-havelin-on-writing-pain.html\">a decade</a><a href=\"https://themillions.com/2019/05/please-read-this-interview-carefully-karen-havelin-on-writing-pain.html\"> after she started suffering</a>. She speaks from angry and agonising experience and that\u2019s reflected in the passion and urgency of her narrative. There\u2019s no questioning her sincerity or the significance of her demand for understanding. But whether or not that makes for quality literature is a more complicated question. Havelin has talent, for sure. Alongside the vivid descriptions of physical pain, there are some lovely passages showing what it means to be able to enjoy your body. A description of Laura\u2019s return to ice skating leaps and twirls from the page, the required physical prowess serving as a counterpoint to her illness. But I also found the inclusion of a series of extracts from a real book about the sport (Skate: 100 years of Figure Skating by Steve Milton) crude and unnecessary.</p> <p>If you\u2019re going to read the book, you\u2019re also going to have to get used to this kind of thing: \u201cMy life is limited. I can\u2019t take long, time-consuming detours any more. I have to go straight there. I have to burn it all to the ground or I won\u2019t survive this. The destruction has been so complete that it closes all windows to the past, until there\u2019s nothing left but a big burnt scar on the ground and smoke tearing through my lungs, my hands black with soot.\u201d It\u2019s a lament and a harangue \u2013 but because there are only so many ways of saying \u201cit hurts\u201d, it can also be repetitive.</p> <p>By the end, that didn\u2019t feel like a problem so much as a source of power. Part of the book\u2019s message is the importance of hearing stories like Laura\u2019s \u2013 and Havelin\u2019s \u2013 when many won\u2019t listen. \u201cIt\u2019s crystal clear to me that no one wants to hear about it,\u201d Laura notes. \u201cBut I will never finish needing to tell how much it hurt, how much it hurts, how bad it is.\u201d Havelin dares you to turn away \u2013 but that\u2019s impossible.</p> <p><strong>Our next book is:</strong> The Unauthorised Biography of Ezra Maas by Daniel James. We\u2019re going to take two weeks for this one \u2013 I\u2019ll be posting my review on 16 September.</p>",

Too much surgery makes it worse, the medications regulate it only partially and have bad side effects, but if we don\u2019t treat it, you\u2019ll get worse every month.\u201d So that\u2019s Laura\u2019s fate. \u201cI was an endless receptacle for pain,\u201d she says \u2013 and Please Read This Leaflet Carefully duly details that pain, surgery to alleviate the agony, then more pain, worry about pain, visits to the doctor, and pain again \u2026 Many books about illness have definite end points: cure or death. A chronic disease is different. For Havelin\u2019s narrator, it\u2019s always ongoing and ever present, even if there are peaks and troughs. But we get a sense of the way the illness has progressed as Havelin moves backwards through Laura\u2019s life. We start in New York, where she often struggles to navigate daily tasks. On bad days, even commuting to work and shopping can push her to the verge of total exhaustion. Touching her baby\u2019s skin can bring her out in a rash. Then we see her as she first moved to the city, followed by her decision to leave her native Norway after long periods of illness - and so on, into her teenage years where she is already all too familiar with physical debilitation, but also training to be a figure skater. By the time we get to this end point we realise both how far Laura has come, and how much of her destiny has been dictated by illness. She notes with bitterness the people who prescribe that we should all \u201ctake complete responsibility\u201d for our lives, \u201cas if the external forces don\u2019t matter at all\u201d. For Laura, there\u2019s no escaping such forces. And her kind of \u201chopelessly under-researched female misery\u201d is not uncommon \u2013 and almost certainly wouldn\u2019t be so under-researched if men had to endure it themselves. Out of the necessary solipsism of illness emerges an empathetic picture of the way endometriosis has blighted millions of lives. It\u2019s been estimated that up to one in 10 women will suffer from it during their reproductive years. That\u2019s about 146 million people right now \u2013 although it\u2019s still depressingly difficult to know precise numbers, because the disease is so often misdiagnosed, dismissed and misunderstood. Havelin was diagnosed with endometriosis a decade after she started suffering. She speaks from angry and agonising experience and that\u2019s reflected in the passion and urgency of her narrative. There\u2019s no questioning her sincerity or the significance of her demand for understanding. But whether or not that makes for quality literature is a more complicated question. Havelin has talent, for sure. Alongside the vivid descriptions of physical pain, there are some lovely passages showing what it means to be able to enjoy your body. A description of Laura\u2019s return to ice skating leaps and twirls from the page, the required physical prowess serving as a counterpoint to her illness. But I also found the inclusion of a series of extracts from a real book about the sport (Skate: 100 years of Figure Skating by Steve Milton) crude and unnecessary. If you\u2019re going to read the book, you\u2019re also going to have to get used to this kind of thing: \u201cMy life is limited. I can\u2019t take long, time-consuming detours any more. I have to go straight there. I have to burn it all to the ground or I won\u2019t survive this. The destruction has been so complete that it closes all windows to the past, until there\u2019s nothing left but a big burnt scar on the ground and smoke tearing through my lungs, my hands black with soot.\u201d It\u2019s a lament and a harangue \u2013 but because there are only so many ways of saying \u201cit hurts\u201d, it can also be repetitive. By the end, that didn\u2019t feel like a problem so much as a source of power. Part of the book\u2019s message is the importance of hearing stories like Laura\u2019s \u2013 and Havelin\u2019s \u2013 when many won\u2019t listen. \u201cIt\u2019s crystal clear to me that no one wants to hear about it,\u201d Laura notes. \u201cBut I will never finish needing to tell how much it hurt, how much it hurts, how bad it is.\u201d Havelin dares you to turn away \u2013 but that\u2019s impossible. Our next book is: The Unauthorised Biography of Ezra Maas by Daniel James. We\u2019re going to take two weeks for this one \u2013 I\u2019ll be posting my review on 16 September.",

      "bodyText": "Nine Entertainment used its historic TV studios in the Sydney suburb of Willoughby to host a $10,000-a-head corporate fundraiser for the Liberal party on Monday night. Hosted by Nine\u2019s CEO, Hugh Marks, corporates paid handsomely for the chance to dine with the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the communications minister, Paul Fletcher, inside Australia\u2019s biggest locally owned media company. Since the merger with Fairfax Media last year, Nine has had control of the Sydney Morning Herald, the Age and the Australian Financial Review, mastheads which have always prided themselves on independent journalism. That independence was still evident as the venue for the Liberal party fundraiser was revealed by the AFR\u2019s gossip columnist Joe Aston. Nine is emerging as a local rival to News Corp Australia after making a $113.94m offer to acquire the remaining shares in Macquarie Media, which owns 2GB. The networking event was organised by the Liberal party\u2019s fundraising arm, the Australian Business Network, which asked Nine to host the dinner at Willoughby and carry the cost of the catering. The TV studio was chosen as a venue because Nine is moving out of the north shore property next year so it has nostalgic value. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The company has a lease on a $1.2bn office tower in North Sydney and the journalists from the Nine newspapers will be moving there to join Nine\u2019s TV division next year. All the funds raised \u2013 at least $700,000 \u2013 will go into Liberal party coffers. Nine said the company donated to both the Liberal and Labor parties and executives were attending an Australian Labor party function on Tuesday. Australian Electoral Commission returns show Nine donated $27,500 to the Liberal and the Labor party in 2017. However, Nine sources say they can\u2019t remember another time when the media company threw open its doors to raise money for a political party. \u201cWe held the odd boardroom lunch for both leaders but not a party political dinner,\u201d a former Nine source said. \u201cIt\u2019s ludicrous and shocking PR.

Now in her 70s, she\u2019s prized across the Atlantic, but isn\u2019t as well known in Britain, where she hasn\u2019t had a regular publisher; here\u2019s hoping that changes with this scintillating showcase of her one-off talent. \u2022 Your Duck Is My Duck by Deborah Eisenberg is published by Europa Editions (\u00a312.99).

Senolytics are particularly exciting, he says, because \u201cthey seem to still work very late in life\u201d ... \u201cSo it will be possible to study more quickly whether they actually work in humans, and they are applicable to people already at the end of their lives.\u201d</p> <p>Xu says that, in theory at least, it should prove impossible to build up a resistance to the drugs, \u201cbecause senescent cells cannot proliferate\u201d. Even more importantly, he says, there is significant data to show \u201cthat you don\u2019t have to treat these patients every single day. You just treat them once a week or once a month \u2026 intermittent treatment is more than enough to have huge benefits.\u201d</p> <p>Senolytic drugs may also be able to play a part in other conditions. Xu has found that obesity can cause senescent cells to develop prematurely. \u201cWe also found that clearing senescent cells improves insulin sensitivity. So senolytic drugs not only work on ageing but also on obesity \u2026 Senescence is a connection between these two very common conditions.\u201d While treating obese mice with senolytics, Xu observed that their anxiety levels reduced, too.</p> <p>These aren\u2019t the only potential added benefits. Gr\u00f6nke says that senescent cells \u201cplay a big role after cancer treatment\u201d, developing as a result of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. \u201cIf senolytics can be used to help eliminate the damaged cells before they can spread, a detrimental side-effect of cancer treatment could be alleviated.\u201d</p> <p>Xu usually administers senolytics to mice at their equivalent of 70 to 80 years old in humans. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to take it when you\u2019re young, which would have zero effect, or harmful effects \u2013 but you don\u2019t want to leave it too late. When to start giving the drug is a huge project and a huge question for us to answer over the next several decades.\u201d He expects the ideal treatment age will differ from person to person, and that ultimately scientists will develop a blood or urine test that can assess the level of senescence present. \u201cSome people age very fast, and some age very slow, so it could vary a lot,\u201d he says.</p> <p>So what can anyone determined to hold off the debilitating effects of age do while we await the wonder drugs? Intermittent fasting may have senescent effects. Gr\u00f6nke says caloric restriction, whereby \u201cpeople eat less in general\u201d, has been linked to healthy ageing and longevity. Mouse trials have shown that they can live 30 to 50% longer than control animals able to eat as much as they want. \u201cIt\u2019s also well known that these animals have less senescent cells at comparable ages.\u201d There is also a diet, developed by the gerontologist Valter Longo at the University of Southern California, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/apr/02/is-fasting-a-free-health-fix-or-just-a-fad-dieting-science-ketagenic-michael-mosley-diabetes-ms\" title=\"\">that mimics the effects of fasting</a> for those too frail to skip meals.</p> <p>Of course, the risks of disease that increase with ageing are heightened by sedentary living, alcoholism and bad diet. Gr\u00f6nke recommends, along with a healthy diet, \u201creducing the amount of animal protein you consume \u2013 you can eat meat but ideally maybe once per week, maximum.\u201d He says an association between low protein intake and longevity is well established in humans. \u201cIdeally the protein should come from vegetables and not from meat.\u201d</p> <p>Just as obesity has been shown to increase the burden of senescent cells in tissue, exercise can reduce it, says Xu. But the effects were recorded in obese mice that had undergone a lot of vigorous exercise: \u201cI don\u2019t think the aged population is able to take intense exercise like that.\u201d</p> <p>So some signs are promising, and the potential is huge, but much still remains unknown about senolytics for ageing. There are clinical trials in the pipeline, with drugs for osteoarthritis leading the way, but an effective pill accessible to all is certainly not imminent. Xu puts it at five to 12 years away: \u201cTheoretically I\u2019m confident.\u201d Those looking to live for ever might be wise to book that cryogenics appointment, just in case.</p>",

      "body": "<p>\u2018Being mad and bad,\u2019 Carrie Gracie writes towards the end of <em>Equal</em>, her account of a year-long struggle to get the BBC to pay her the same as her male counterparts, \u201cis exhausting.\u201d Eating chorizo hash in an upscale breakfast spot near Broadcasting House in London, where she\u2019s about to go on shift, Gracie doesn\u2019t look mad, or bad, or even exhausted. Indeed, she\u2019s recently returned from a holiday in Majorca during which she hopped over to Ibiza and was snapped clubbing with her news colleague, Simon McCoy. One might even say she looks pretty perky.</p> <p>She was referring to that moment in a battle when you have to convince your opponent that you are willing to do what it takes to achieve your goal; that you will not blink, or back down, or slink away. And on 4 June 2018, when her grievance appeal was turned down with no further option but litigation, Gracie didn\u2019t blink; she threatened war. When the BBC responded by sending a senior executive to her house to negotiate, she hid the washing up and the dog\u2019s toys, shooed her teenage son upstairs and turned her garden sprinkler on to hide the unmown grass. \u201cImagine the home of a single parent locked in a long battle with her employer and suffering depression as a result,\u201d she writes. \u201cThat\u2019s what my house looked like.\u201d It didn\u2019t matter. The BBC had agreed to pay parity, and to backdate the consequent increase. She had won.</p> <p>Victory, though, is rarely the final moment. Particularly when you have a powerful collective \u2013 known as BBC Women \u2013 to fight injustice alongside you, and when your objective is not to destroy an organisation, but to make it confront inequality and reform. And particularly when you were shocked to find yourself in a fight at all.</p> <p>\u201cI just thought we\u2019d sort it out,\u201d Gracie tells me of the period in July 2017 when, after the BBC was compelled by Royal Charter to publish details of salaries over \u00a3150,000, she discovered that she was being paid substantially less as China editor than the corporation\u2019s US editor, Jon Sopel, or its man in the Middle East, Jeremy Bowen. \u201cWe\u2019d have a conversation, we\u2019d sort it out \u2013 because I\u2019d asked for equal pay before I went to China, for one thing, and I was just like, \u2018Well what on earth\u2019s happened here? This is all a bit weird.\u2019 So in the beginning, I guess I thought it was the anomaly that they kept claiming it was.\u201d The words \u201coversight\u201d and \u201canomaly\u201d, she drily notes, are much beloved by those who pay women less than they\u2019re entitled to and then get found out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8bee4458655004c76fc4e5a420a8d08d146bebfd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8bee4458655004c76fc4e5a420a8d08d146bebfd/0_140_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marching for equality: Carrie Gracie and BBC employees gather outside Broadcasting House in London to highlight equal pay on International Women\u2019s Day.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marching for equality: Carrie Gracie and BBC employees gather outside Broadcasting House in London to highlight equal pay on International Women\u2019s Day.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Stillwell/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As it turned out, there seemed to be no intention of \u201csorting it out\u201d; rather, Gracie embarked on a protracted series of confrontations in which her sense of self-esteem and her faith in professionalism and ethical behaviour were shaken. Throughout, she was sustained by the solidarity of female colleagues, although she remains adamant that this is a universal problem: \u201cWhenever anyone makes it a woman\u2019s issue, it annoys me. It\u2019s a human issue. And do they believe in equality? Do they believe in justice?\u201d</p> <p>Gracie had not been dissatisfied with her annual pay of \u00a3134,000; and she is well aware of her own privilege as an Oxford graduate, a longtime journalist and a white, middle-class woman. (Nor was she shy of talking about pay; back in 2009, at the height of the MPs\u2019 expenses scandal, she had responded to a demand from Lord Foulkes, irritated at being questioned by her, to reveal her salary: \u00a392,000, she replied, immediately and unapologetically. In the hoopla after the programme, it was reported that McCoy, her co-host, was earning \u00a3190,000, although the BBC denied it.) But now she was angry that the post she had been all but begged by James Harding, then director of news, to take three-and-a-half years earlier was being remunerated at up to half the rate \u2013 high salaries were published in bands \u2013 than those performing a clearly comparable role. Harding had invoked her experience and expertise \u2013 now 57, she had joined the World Service in 1987, covered the death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/dec/18/globaleconomy-economics\" title=\"\">Deng Xiaoping</a>, the handover of Hong Kong and the Beijing Olympics, and speaks fluent Mandarin \u2013 and the urgency of covering China\u2019s rise as a superpower to persuade her; she would not simply be good in the role, she was arguably the only person who could do it to the required standard.</p> <p>Gracie\u2019s hesitation was not due to a lack of interest, but a consideration of the impact of a long-distance, high-profile job on her teenage children, one of whom had endured childhood leukaemia and both of whom had watched their mother survive breast cancer. There were also the challenges of reporting from a heavily censored, one-party state. But when she accepted the role, urged by friends and family, she demanded equal pay, having long suspected that she was paid less than male colleagues. Until July 2017, she believed she had secured it.</p> <p>She is at pains to point out that it wasn\u2019t about the money and, indeed, when she reached a financial settlement with the BBC, she donated the full amount of \u00a3361,000 to the <a href=\"https://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/equal-pay-advice-service\" title=\"\">Equal Pay Advice Service and the Fawcett Society</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b953f3188bcd58c11803b6e1d5f09c6b0c7224d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b953f3188bcd58c11803b6e1d5f09c6b0c7224d/0_258_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carrie Grace on assignment in Tiananmen Square\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Making the news: Carrie Gracie on assignment in Tiananmen Square</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carrie Gracie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIf I\u2019d been more motivated by money than I was by advancing gender equality,\u201d she explains now, \u201cthen I might have pursued a different course. But I wasn\u2019t, because I am very deeply \u2013 what would be the verb? \u2013 immersed in BBC values.\u201d</p> <p>Among those values, one might conclude, are fairness, impartiality and a respect for facts. But Gracie\u2019s attempts to correct the \u201coversight\u201d suggest otherwise. \u201cI definitely think it\u2019s easy to make the mistake of pointing out a problem and think that by articulating the problem clearly and forcefully you are thereby solving the problem,\u201d she says. \u201cI learned the hard way that that\u2019s not how it works; you know, reasoning with people who are powerful, wealthy, have status, reason with them and you can make the best argument in the world. It can be evidence-based until the cows don\u2019t come home and you\u2019re still not going to win.\u201d</p> <p>One of the reasons is that pay, as well as being an emotive and often obscured part of our lives, is also, as Gracie points out, like the game Jenga \u2013 once you start to mess with one brick, the whole edifice starts to wobble. That\u2019s why, she argues, employers in cases like these attempt to \u201ckeep it isolated in one woman\u2019s silo and then preferably she will sign some kind of confidentiality clause about it, about the back pay or whatever they\u2019re going to give her to make it right, then often it does stay quiet and it gets resolved\u201d.</p> <p>Less chance of that, of course, when the organisation is a highly scrutinised and publicly funded national institution; one in which the subjects themselves are adept at gathering and disseminating news. At the beginning of 2018, getting nowhere with the BBC, after having taken advice from such BBC luminaries as Clare Balding, Fiona Bruce and Mishal Husain, Gracie threw a gigantic stone into the millpond by using the letters page of the <em>Times</em> to reveal the details of her case; on the front page, the newspaper reported that more than 130 other women working at the BBC had endorsed her case. That same morning, Gracie headed into Broadcasting House to present the <em>Today</em> programme \u2013 in one of the situation\u2019s many grim ironies, she had been given some holiday cover in response to widespread complaints that the programme didn\u2019t have enough female presenters. Her co-presenter was John Humphrys who, she writes in <em>Equal</em>, arrived at 4am, told her that her letter was either idiocy or a stroke of genius, and \u201cthen did some harrumphing that it would be uncollegiate of me to repeat\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dcabd105b528fdd206d7a6598656ad55b52bc1a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dcabd105b528fdd206d7a6598656ad55b52bc1a9/0_47_1944_1166/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carrie Gracie and family in China\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two plus two: Gracie with her ex-husband Jin and young family in China</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carrie Gracie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During our conversation, I press her to do precisely that \u2013 in particular concerning the far-from-supportive conversation that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jan/12/john-humphrys-jokes-about-bbc-gender-pay-gap-in-leaked-off-air-recording\" title=\"\">Humphrys was recorded having with Jon Sopel</a>, both of them presuming themselves to be off air. (It is a matter of continuing amazement that veteran broadcasters seem to have such trouble remembering the cast-iron rule that you are never alone with a microphone.) What did she feel? What did the programme\u2019s editor, Sarah Sands, delayed by travel arrangements that morning, say to her when they finally caught up?</p> <p>She is admirably, if frustratingly, guarded; she replies that she has said everything she wants to say about her colleagues in <em>Equal</em>, and doesn\u2019t want to speak off the cuff. (Even in the book she\u2019s tactful, saying that she felt the pair had let her, the BBC and its audiences down.) Of Sands, she says now: \u201cI mean private conversations are private conversations, so I said what I said. I actually think Sarah just laughed but I can\u2019t remember, to be honest.\u201d Where Gracie is prepared to be forthcoming is on the toll that such a gruelling and prolonged experience takes. She stopped sleeping properly and became depressed; eventually, her doctor signed her off work. \u201cI was mentally unwell,\u201d she says now. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not uncommon. These fights take a huge amount out of people.\u201d</p> <p>What was her primary sensation? \u201cHelplessness. I don\u2019t like feeling helpless. And when I feel helpless, I feel really helpless, it\u2019s physically, emotionally immobilising. I have to lie down, you know? I don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t know how to operate.\u201d</p> <p>This comes from a woman who has faced more than her fair share of harrowing loss and trauma.

The BBC had said the role was \u201con a par with\u201d the other international editors. I\u2019d explicitly made equal pay with my male peers a condition of taking the job. Four years on, my salary was \u00a3134,000 but this pay list said the North America editor was earning between \u00a3200,000 and \u00a3250,000.</p> <p>Equal pay might sound like an unusual deal-breaker, but it made perfect sense to me. Like many women at the BBC, I had long suspected I was earning less than the men I worked alongside. But in an environment where pay was opaque and talking about it taboo, it seemed preferable to talk about the journalism.</p> <p>I\u2019d never asked my peers directly what they were earning and never issued an ultimatum on pay. I liked my male colleagues. It seemed invidious to challenge managers in a way that might impact the pay of people I liked.</p> <p>When I went through treatment for breast cancer, my bosses were kind to me. I reasoned that, in many ways, the BBC was a good employer. In return, I had always tried to be a good employee. Every year I persuaded my ex-husband Jin to come back from Beijing and stand in at home for a few weeks so that I could do one big reporting trip to China, and I never demanded higher pay for all the prep and post-production. The BBC showed me goodwill and I showed it goodwill back. One of my documentary projects followed the transformation of China through the experiences of three families in a village that was being razed to make way for a city. This White Horse Village series won the BBC a Peabody Award and an Emmy. At the moment the Emmy was announced in New York, I was, quite literally, washing up at my kitchen sink.</p> <p>My children, Rachel and Daniel, were 12 and 10 at the time, and as I dried my hands and sat down to help with homework I joked that I was a real-life Cinderella. But not being invited to the ball was a commonplace at the BBC. We had lots of people who did brilliant work for little recognition.</p> <p>In a letter to the director-general, Tony Hall, I wrote that unless I was made equal I would resign: \u201cI am a cancer survivor in my mid-50s who lost my own mother to cancer when I was a teenager and who nursed my own daughter through childhood leukaemia. I did not apply for the China editor post, and was reluctant to take it, precisely because of the strains I knew it would impose on my family and my health. I agreed to do the job because I cared about our coverage of China and because I thought the BBC needed older women journalists to \u2018lean in\u2019. I am bitterly disappointed to discover that my contribution as an editor is valued at so much less than my male peers.\u2019 I warned the director-general that unless I was made equal I would resign.</p> <p>I then worked backwards through the past 20 years of my career, asking male peers direct questions about pay. I chose not to tackle this face to face or on the phone, but to put questions in writing instead, as I felt this would allow me to be polite and clear and would allow them time to consider. My email explained that I realised they were under no obligation to disclose their salaries and might prefer not to, but that the recent revelations compelled me to ask in an attempt to make sense of my own pay story.</p> <p>The responses were mixed. Some men, like the Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen and the world affairs editor John Simpson, were generous with information. Others were less so. Asking became easier the more often I did it, and in the end I wished I had started years ago as it came to feel natural and collegiate, just something that all grown-ups should do. I felt grateful to those who shared. Theirs was a real-world demonstration of empathy, one of the simplest but most powerful things a man can do to help a woman achieve equal pay.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6cf6ec1cfba2e9560bef40d814417f4170a5bc24\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6cf6ec1cfba2e9560bef40d814417f4170a5bc24/0_0_1889_2906/650.jpg\" alt=\"Book jacket of Equal by Carrie Gracie\" width=\"650\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em>Equal, by Carrie Gracie, is published by Little, Brown on 5 September (\u00a318.99).

      "bodyText": "\u2018Being mad and bad,\u2019 Carrie Gracie writes towards the end of Equal, her account of a year-long struggle to get the BBC to pay her the same as her male counterparts, \u201cis exhausting.\u201d Eating chorizo hash in an upscale breakfast spot near Broadcasting House in London, where she\u2019s about to go on shift, Gracie doesn\u2019t look mad, or bad, or even exhausted. Indeed, she\u2019s recently returned from a holiday in Majorca during which she hopped over to Ibiza and was snapped clubbing with her news colleague, Simon McCoy. One might even say she looks pretty perky. She was referring to that moment in a battle when you have to convince your opponent that you are willing to do what it takes to achieve your goal; that you will not blink, or back down, or slink away. And on 4 June 2018, when her grievance appeal was turned down with no further option but litigation, Gracie didn\u2019t blink; she threatened war. When the BBC responded by sending a senior executive to her house to negotiate, she hid the washing up and the dog\u2019s toys, shooed her teenage son upstairs and turned her garden sprinkler on to hide the unmown grass. \u201cImagine the home of a single parent locked in a long battle with her employer and suffering depression as a result,\u201d she writes. \u201cThat\u2019s what my house looked like.\u201d It didn\u2019t matter. The BBC had agreed to pay parity, and to backdate the consequent increase. She had won. Victory, though, is rarely the final moment. Particularly when you have a powerful collective \u2013 known as BBC Women \u2013 to fight injustice alongside you, and when your objective is not to destroy an organisation, but to make it confront inequality and reform. And particularly when you were shocked to find yourself in a fight at all. \u201cI just thought we\u2019d sort it out,\u201d Gracie tells me of the period in July 2017 when, after the BBC was compelled by Royal Charter to publish details of salaries over \u00a3150,000, she discovered that she was being paid substantially less as China editor than the corporation\u2019s US editor, Jon Sopel, or its man in the Middle East, Jeremy Bowen. \u201cWe\u2019d have a conversation, we\u2019d sort it out \u2013 because I\u2019d asked for equal pay before I went to China, for one thing, and I was just like, \u2018Well what on earth\u2019s happened here? This is all a bit weird.\u2019 So in the beginning, I guess I thought it was the anomaly that they kept claiming it was.\u201d The words \u201coversight\u201d and \u201canomaly\u201d, she drily notes, are much beloved by those who pay women less than they\u2019re entitled to and then get found out. As it turned out, there seemed to be no intention of \u201csorting it out\u201d; rather, Gracie embarked on a protracted series of confrontations in which her sense of self-esteem and her faith in professionalism and ethical behaviour were shaken. Throughout, she was sustained by the solidarity of female colleagues, although she remains adamant that this is a universal problem: \u201cWhenever anyone makes it a woman\u2019s issue, it annoys me. It\u2019s a human issue. And do they believe in equality? Do they believe in justice?\u201d Gracie had not been dissatisfied with her annual pay of \u00a3134,000; and she is well aware of her own privilege as an Oxford graduate, a longtime journalist and a white, middle-class woman. (Nor was she shy of talking about pay; back in 2009, at the height of the MPs\u2019 expenses scandal, she had responded to a demand from Lord Foulkes, irritated at being questioned by her, to reveal her salary: \u00a392,000, she replied, immediately and unapologetically. In the hoopla after the programme, it was reported that McCoy, her co-host, was earning \u00a3190,000, although the BBC denied it.) But now she was angry that the post she had been all but begged by James Harding, then director of news, to take three-and-a-half years earlier was being remunerated at up to half the rate \u2013 high salaries were published in bands \u2013 than those performing a clearly comparable role. Harding had invoked her experience and expertise \u2013 now 57, she had joined the World Service in 1987, covered the death of Deng Xiaoping, the handover of Hong Kong and the Beijing Olympics, and speaks fluent Mandarin \u2013 and the urgency of covering China\u2019s rise as a superpower to persuade her; she would not simply be good in the role, she was arguably the only person who could do it to the required standard. Gracie\u2019s hesitation was not due to a lack of interest, but a consideration of the impact of a long-distance, high-profile job on her teenage children, one of whom had endured childhood leukaemia and both of whom had watched their mother survive breast cancer. There were also the challenges of reporting from a heavily censored, one-party state. But when she accepted the role, urged by friends and family, she demanded equal pay, having long suspected that she was paid less than male colleagues. Until July 2017, she believed she had secured it. She is at pains to point out that it wasn\u2019t about the money and, indeed, when she reached a financial settlement with the BBC, she donated the full amount of \u00a3361,000 to the Equal Pay Advice Service and the Fawcett Society. \u201cIf I\u2019d been more motivated by money than I was by advancing gender equality,\u201d she explains now, \u201cthen I might have pursued a different course. But I wasn\u2019t, because I am very deeply \u2013 what would be the verb? \u2013 immersed in BBC values.\u201d Among those values, one might conclude, are fairness, impartiality and a respect for facts. But Gracie\u2019s attempts to correct the \u201coversight\u201d suggest otherwise. \u201cI definitely think it\u2019s easy to make the mistake of pointing out a problem and think that by articulating the problem clearly and forcefully you are thereby solving the problem,\u201d she says. \u201cI learned the hard way that that\u2019s not how it works; you know, reasoning with people who are powerful, wealthy, have status, reason with them and you can make the best argument in the world. It can be evidence-based until the cows don\u2019t come home and you\u2019re still not going to win.\u201d One of the reasons is that pay, as well as being an emotive and often obscured part of our lives, is also, as Gracie points out, like the game Jenga \u2013 once you start to mess with one brick, the whole edifice starts to wobble. That\u2019s why, she argues, employers in cases like these attempt to \u201ckeep it isolated in one woman\u2019s silo and then preferably she will sign some kind of confidentiality clause about it, about the back pay or whatever they\u2019re going to give her to make it right, then often it does stay quiet and it gets resolved\u201d. Less chance of that, of course, when the organisation is a highly scrutinised and publicly funded national institution; one in which the subjects themselves are adept at gathering and disseminating news. At the beginning of 2018, getting nowhere with the BBC, after having taken advice from such BBC luminaries as Clare Balding, Fiona Bruce and Mishal Husain, Gracie threw a gigantic stone into the millpond by using the letters page of the Times to reveal the details of her case; on the front page, the newspaper reported that more than 130 other women working at the BBC had endorsed her case. That same morning, Gracie headed into Broadcasting House to present the Today programme \u2013 in one of the situation\u2019s many grim ironies, she had been given some holiday cover in response to widespread complaints that the programme didn\u2019t have enough female presenters. Her co-presenter was John Humphrys who, she writes in Equal, arrived at 4am, told her that her letter was either idiocy or a stroke of genius, and \u201cthen did some harrumphing that it would be uncollegiate of me to repeat\u201d. During our conversation, I press her to do precisely that \u2013 in particular concerning the far-from-supportive conversation that Humphrys was recorded having with Jon Sopel, both of them presuming themselves to be off air. (It is a matter of continuing amazement that veteran broadcasters seem to have such trouble remembering the cast-iron rule that you are never alone with a microphone.) What did she feel? What did the programme\u2019s editor, Sarah Sands, delayed by travel arrangements that morning, say to her when they finally caught up? She is admirably, if frustratingly, guarded; she replies that she has said everything she wants to say about her colleagues in Equal, and doesn\u2019t want to speak off the cuff. (Even in the book she\u2019s tactful, saying that she felt the pair had let her, the BBC and its audiences down.) Of Sands, she says now: \u201cI mean private conversations are private conversations, so I said what I said. I actually think Sarah just laughed but I can\u2019t remember, to be honest.\u201d Where Gracie is prepared to be forthcoming is on the toll that such a gruelling and prolonged experience takes. She stopped sleeping properly and became depressed; eventually, her doctor signed her off work. \u201cI was mentally unwell,\u201d she says now. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not uncommon. These fights take a huge amount out of people.\u201d What was her primary sensation? \u201cHelplessness. I don\u2019t like feeling helpless. And when I feel helpless, I feel really helpless, it\u2019s physically, emotionally immobilising. I have to lie down, you know? I don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t know how to operate.\u201d This comes from a woman who has faced more than her fair share of harrowing loss and trauma. Her mother died of ovarian cancer at 42, when Gracie, the second of five children, was 17. It was, she agrees, an existential crisis. \u201cI think my mother had provided my map of the world and without her it was hard to see why to get up in the morning or what you would do if you did get up in the morning. It was hard to have any sense of purpose about life at all.\u201d It also gave her, she thinks, a sense of impatience, a conviction that waiting around for things to happen is a fool\u2019s errand. That profound understanding that life is precarious and unpredictable can only have been reinforced by her daughter Rachel\u2019s diagnosis with leukaemia when she was two years old. Gracie\u2019s marriage, to Chinese musician Cheng Jin, foundered under the strain, and although he has stepped into the breach at various points, Gracie has for long periods been their children\u2019s principal carer. She inherited the BRCA1 gene from her mother, which put her at risk of both breast and ovarian cancer; in her 40s, she had breast cancer twice and went through chemotherapy and mastectomies. Gracie\u2019s mother died, she says, because despite their best efforts, the medical profession had not found a way to cure her; she and her daughter survived because they had. In her battle with her employer, she says she felt they were \u201cfinding clever ways to avoid solving the problems\u2026 that\u2019s not acceptable to me. Life is short. We\u2019re not going to do this.\u201d Equal comes out at the beginning of this month, just a few months short of half a century after the 1970 Equal Pay Act. Carrie Gracie has returned to the BBC News Channel, where she worked before her appointment as China editor. BBC Women still exists; Gracie describes them as \u201ca large group of people who still believe in the things we believed in two years ago.

She hesitates before offering that she walks her dog and reads. \u201cYeah,\u201d she says, ruefully. \u201cExciting life. What do I do?

The ban comes as disturbing footage emerged of Indonesian soldiers firing on peaceful demonstrators during clashes last week in which protesters say six people died. Three West Papuan students have reportedly been shot in their dormitories by militia groups amid growing tensions in the region. The mineral-rich but underdeveloped and impoverished region of Papua has been the scene of a low-level insurgency against Indonesia\u2019s rule for decades. But protests marking the August anniversaries of the New York Agreement and the Act of Free Choice \u2013 the political acts that formalised Indonesian control of Papua \u2013 have been further sparked by racist bullying of Papuan students in Java, and police reprisals against them for demonstrating.

Lonsdale aimed to show that the 18th-century poem had a range beyond the canonical, and was not necessarily well-mannered and fashionably dressed.

The poem\u2019s model, the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/art/Pindaric-ode\">Pindaric ode</a>, allows a variegated metrical structure which makes for a lively, lurching, faintly seasick pace. The fact that there are only three stanzas means the pattern never quite \u201csets\u201d into the expected.

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.<br></p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>A proposed bill drawn up by a cross-party group of backbench rebels could emerge as early as Monday.

Early on, Monte established a central fund that would entail all income and assets being shared equally among the families. This collective enterprise underscored the tribal nature of the Salmon-Glucksteins: when one branch of the family moved west to prosperous Kensington and Holland Park, the rest followed. There was a proviso: women would be taken care of financially but were strictly excluded from involvement in the business. The fund would have unhappy repercussions inside the family later on, notably in the case of their celebrated painter, Hannah Gluckstein, AKA Gluck, who lived from 1895 to 1978, and whose Eton crop, mannish suits and bohemian lifestyle set her at odds with her parents. Such were her connections that she had to beg her mother not to invite members of the royal family to her shows at the Fine Art Society (they came anyway).</p> <p>Harding, obliged to play diplomat as well as biographer, treats the ingrained sexism of the firm with bemusement, where an impartial chronicler might have taken a tougher line. Often he sounds like the dutiful son delivering a family address. In his anxiety to pay each member their due he strays into prolixity and an inclusiveness that render the book a little stodgy.</p> <p>But how the Lyons operation reached deep into the public consciousness can hardly fail to enthral. Investment in West End property \u2013 the Regent Palace hotel, the Strand Palace, the Trocadero \u2013 tightened its grip on the catering market. In 1909 the first Corner House on Coventry Street was opened, and a new age of elegant public dining for the masses began.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"041f31d47d6ef71763d8fec32083d998e2b3e306\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/041f31d47d6ef71763d8fec32083d998e2b3e306/0_220_2675_3342/800.jpg\" alt=\"A waitress working hard behind the counter.

The Lyons waitress in her neat cap and pinafore quickly became known as the \u201cNippy\u201d. They were valued by the family up to a point, but promotion was scarce for female staff and no senior managers or board members at Lyons were women. These were the times.</p> <p>One wonders if a woman at the helm might have saved the company from its ignominious collapse. During and after the second world war, when the family were involved in the kindertransport and won the royal warrant to feed the army, the business held steady. As late as 1969 Lyons\u2019s annual turnover was \u00a3100m and it remained a brand leader in tea, coffee, cake and ice cream. It was undone by spending in the 1970s, buying up businesses at a headlong rate just as the oil crisis hit and the world economy went into meltdown. Almost overnight the families were plunged into debt and forced to sell the hotels; by 1976 they were struggling to survive. The saddest moment in the book comes when the chief executive decides to close the tea shops and an era ends. The company was sold to Allied Breweries two years later. <em>Sic transit gloria Monte</em>. Is it a cautionary tale about the treatment of women denied preferment in the workplace? Perhaps. It\u2019s certainly an illustration of financial hubris and bad advice. Nearly half a century on, the Lyons name and Corner Houses have faded, quite forgotten.

This collective enterprise underscored the tribal nature of the Salmon-Glucksteins: when one branch of the family moved west to prosperous Kensington and Holland Park, the rest followed. There was a proviso: women would be taken care of financially but were strictly excluded from involvement in the business. The fund would have unhappy repercussions inside the family later on, notably in the case of their celebrated painter, Hannah Gluckstein, AKA Gluck, who lived from 1895 to 1978, and whose Eton crop, mannish suits and bohemian lifestyle set her at odds with her parents. Such were her connections that she had to beg her mother not to invite members of the royal family to her shows at the Fine Art Society (they came anyway). Harding, obliged to play diplomat as well as biographer, treats the ingrained sexism of the firm with bemusement, where an impartial chronicler might have taken a tougher line. Often he sounds like the dutiful son delivering a family address. In his anxiety to pay each member their due he strays into prolixity and an inclusiveness that render the book a little stodgy. But how the Lyons operation reached deep into the public consciousness can hardly fail to enthral. Investment in West End property \u2013 the Regent Palace hotel, the Strand Palace, the Trocadero \u2013 tightened its grip on the catering market. In 1909 the first Corner House on Coventry Street was opened, and a new age of elegant public dining for the masses began. In the interwar period, its golden years, the place expanded to seat 4,500 people at any one time. The Lyons waitress in her neat cap and pinafore quickly became known as the \u201cNippy\u201d. They were valued by the family up to a point, but promotion was scarce for female staff and no senior managers or board members at Lyons were women. These were the times. One wonders if a woman at the helm might have saved the company from its ignominious collapse. During and after the second world war, when the family were involved in the kindertransport and won the royal warrant to feed the army, the business held steady. As late as 1969 Lyons\u2019s annual turnover was \u00a3100m and it remained a brand leader in tea, coffee, cake and ice cream. It was undone by spending in the 1970s, buying up businesses at a headlong rate just as the oil crisis hit and the world economy went into meltdown. Almost overnight the families were plunged into debt and forced to sell the hotels; by 1976 they were struggling to survive. The saddest moment in the book comes when the chief executive decides to close the tea shops and an era ends. The company was sold to Allied Breweries two years later. Sic transit gloria Monte. Is it a cautionary tale about the treatment of women denied preferment in the workplace? Perhaps. It\u2019s certainly an illustration of financial hubris and bad advice. Nearly half a century on, the Lyons name and Corner Houses have faded, quite forgotten. I dream of them still. \u2022 Legacy: One Family, A Cup of Tea and the Company That Took on the World by Thomas Harding is published by William Heinemann (\u00a325).

      "body": "<p>The internet represents the biggest explosion of data in human history. There\u2019s more out there, and more access to it than ever before. The information ecosystem is a bit like a tropical rainforest: luxuriant, dense and fiercely competitive. As such, it contains its fair share of predators and poisonous plants.</p> <p>Deliberately misleading articles, websites and social media posts can come about for lots of different reasons: they might be trying to influence elections or policies; they might represent a form of cyberwarfare between states; they might be aimed at raising someone\u2019s profile and influence, or discrediting their opponents. Or they might simply be about making money, relying on the attention-grabbing nature of outrageous lies to generate ad revenue, as in the case of the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2017/02/veles-macedonia-fake-news/\">digital gold rush</a>\u201d that saw a small Macedonian town register more than 150 pro-Trump websites during the 2016 presidential race.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We may have to rely on AI to do the heavy lifting for us \u2013 and tell us whether telltale linguistic patterns are present</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One thing they may have in common, however, is the language they use.</p> <p>Having a reliable way of identifying fake news is important. The whole reason it\u2019s a problem is that it mimics reliable reporting \u2013 and people can\u2019t always tell the difference. That\u2019s why, for the past few years, researchers have been trying to work out what the linguistic characteristics of fake news are. Computers that are fed material already classified as misleading are able to identify patterns in the language used. They\u2019re then able to apply that knowledge to new material, and flag it as potentially dubious.</p> <p>One such project, led by Fatemeh Torabi Asr at Simon Fraser University in Canada, recently <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-language-gives-it-away-how-an-algorithm-can-help-us-detect-fake-news-120199\">found</a> that \u201con average, fake news articles use more \u2026 words related to sex, death and anxiety\u201d. \u201cOverly emotional\u201d language is often deployed. In contrast, \u201cGenuine news \u2026 contains a larger proportion of words related to work (business) and money (economy).\u201d</p> <p>Another group of researchers <a href=\"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D17-1317\">analysed</a> the relationship of various grammatical categories to fake news. They concluded that words which can be used to exaggerate are all found more often in deliberately misleading sources. These included superlatives, like \u201cmost\u201d and \u201cworst\u201d, and so-called subjectives, like \u201cbrilliant\u201d and \u201cterrible\u201d. They noted that propaganda tends to use abstract generalities like \u201ctruth\u201d and \u201cfreedom\u201d, and intriguingly showed that use of the second-person pronoun \u201cyou\u201d was closely linked to fake news.</p> <p>Some of these approaches have their problems. Jack Grieve, at the University of Birmingham, cautions that scholars don\u2019t always control for genre \u2013 so the differences in language seen above might just come down to the difference between a more formal news article, and a more casual Facebook post.</p> <p>To get around this problem, Grieve\u2019s team has compared 40 retracted and 41 non-retracted articles by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/mar/06/usa.pressandpublishing\">Jayson Blair</a>, who resigned from the New York Times in disgrace in 2003. These were produced in a single genre \u2013 national newspaper writing \u2013 but they still displayed subtle, probably unconscious differences in register, related, according to Grieve, to the different communicative purposes they served (on the one hand to inform, on the other to deceive). Even though he was trying to pass his work off as factual, there were subtle tells that only become evident when the data is crunched. For example, there were more emphatics like \u201creally\u201d and \u201cmost\u201d in Blair\u2019s retracted articles. He used shorter words and his language was less \u201cinformationally dense\u201d. The present tense cropped up more often and he relied on the third person pronouns \u201che\u201d and \u201cshe\u201d rather than full names \u2013 something that\u2019s typical of fiction.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/aug/27/immigration-panic-how-the-west-fell-for-manufactured-rage\">Immigration panic: how the west fell for manufactured rage</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So what does all this tell us? Clearly, we don\u2019t have a foolproof means of telling fact from fake yet, but there are certain features that should put us on our guard. Is the writing more informal than you\u2019d expect? Does it contain lots of superlatives and emphatic language? Does it make subjective judgments or read more like narrative than reportage? Ultimately, we may have to rely on artificial intelligence to do the heavy lifting for us \u2013 and it should be able to tell us whether those telltale linguistic patterns seen in large datasets of fake news, invisible to the \u201cnaked eye\u201d, are present.</p> <p>For me there\u2019s an interesting correspondence with certain kinds of political rhetoric here. The language of fakery, with its powerful subjective statements and focus on anxiety, has something in common with that used by populist leaders. Their style, which often <a href=\"http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/110976/3/5820-23679-1-PB.pdf\">involves</a> \u201cadversarial, emotional, patriotic and abrasive speech\u201d should put us on our guard too.

      "bodyText": "The internet represents the biggest explosion of data in human history. There\u2019s more out there, and more access to it than ever before. The information ecosystem is a bit like a tropical rainforest: luxuriant, dense and fiercely competitive. As such, it contains its fair share of predators and poisonous plants. Deliberately misleading articles, websites and social media posts can come about for lots of different reasons: they might be trying to influence elections or policies; they might represent a form of cyberwarfare between states; they might be aimed at raising someone\u2019s profile and influence, or discrediting their opponents. Or they might simply be about making money, relying on the attention-grabbing nature of outrageous lies to generate ad revenue, as in the case of the \u201cdigital gold rush\u201d that saw a small Macedonian town register more than 150 pro-Trump websites during the 2016 presidential race. One thing they may have in common, however, is the language they use. Having a reliable way of identifying fake news is important. The whole reason it\u2019s a problem is that it mimics reliable reporting \u2013 and people can\u2019t always tell the difference. That\u2019s why, for the past few years, researchers have been trying to work out what the linguistic characteristics of fake news are. Computers that are fed material already classified as misleading are able to identify patterns in the language used. They\u2019re then able to apply that knowledge to new material, and flag it as potentially dubious. One such project, led by Fatemeh Torabi Asr at Simon Fraser University in Canada, recently found that \u201con average, fake news articles use more \u2026 words related to sex, death and anxiety\u201d. \u201cOverly emotional\u201d language is often deployed. In contrast, \u201cGenuine news \u2026 contains a larger proportion of words related to work (business) and money (economy).\u201d Another group of researchers analysed the relationship of various grammatical categories to fake news. They concluded that words which can be used to exaggerate are all found more often in deliberately misleading sources. These included superlatives, like \u201cmost\u201d and \u201cworst\u201d, and so-called subjectives, like \u201cbrilliant\u201d and \u201cterrible\u201d. They noted that propaganda tends to use abstract generalities like \u201ctruth\u201d and \u201cfreedom\u201d, and intriguingly showed that use of the second-person pronoun \u201cyou\u201d was closely linked to fake news. Some of these approaches have their problems. Jack Grieve, at the University of Birmingham, cautions that scholars don\u2019t always control for genre \u2013 so the differences in language seen above might just come down to the difference between a more formal news article, and a more casual Facebook post. To get around this problem, Grieve\u2019s team has compared 40 retracted and 41 non-retracted articles by Jayson Blair, who resigned from the New York Times in disgrace in 2003. These were produced in a single genre \u2013 national newspaper writing \u2013 but they still displayed subtle, probably unconscious differences in register, related, according to Grieve, to the different communicative purposes they served (on the one hand to inform, on the other to deceive). Even though he was trying to pass his work off as factual, there were subtle tells that only become evident when the data is crunched. For example, there were more emphatics like \u201creally\u201d and \u201cmost\u201d in Blair\u2019s retracted articles. He used shorter words and his language was less \u201cinformationally dense\u201d. The present tense cropped up more often and he relied on the third person pronouns \u201che\u201d and \u201cshe\u201d rather than full names \u2013 something that\u2019s typical of fiction. So what does all this tell us? Clearly, we don\u2019t have a foolproof means of telling fact from fake yet, but there are certain features that should put us on our guard. Is the writing more informal than you\u2019d expect? Does it contain lots of superlatives and emphatic language? Does it make subjective judgments or read more like narrative than reportage? Ultimately, we may have to rely on artificial intelligence to do the heavy lifting for us \u2013 and it should be able to tell us whether those telltale linguistic patterns seen in large datasets of fake news, invisible to the \u201cnaked eye\u201d, are present. For me there\u2019s an interesting correspondence with certain kinds of political rhetoric here. The language of fakery, with its powerful subjective statements and focus on anxiety, has something in common with that used by populist leaders. Their style, which often involves \u201cadversarial, emotional, patriotic and abrasive speech\u201d should put us on our guard too. Cooler heads make for a more boring read, but they might get you a little closer to the truth. \u2022 David Shariatmadari is a Guardian editor and writer, and author of Don\u2019t Believe A Word: The Surprising Truth About Language",

      "body": "<p>Last month, the foreign registration documentation for Saudi Arabia\u2019s 2018 lobbying campaign in the United States were made available online. The documents shed light on the kingdom\u2019s aggressive sportswashing strategy that included meetings and business calls with the commissioners for Major League Soccer (MLS), Major League Baseball (MLB), as well as officials from the National Basketball Association (NBA), World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and the Los Angeles Olympic Committee.</p> <p>Saudi Arabia\u2019s strategic interest in sports and entertainment events dates back to November 2016 when crown prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the kingdom\u2019s General Sports Authority \u2013 the government body responsible for the development of sports in the kingdom \u2013 to set up a <a href=\"http://english.alarabiya.net/en/sports/2016/11/15/Saudi-Arabia-to-set-up-Sports-Development-Fund.html\">Sports Development Fund</a> that bolstered sports activity in the country. The objectives of the fund were to privatize football clubs to increase participation, promote new sports events, and <a href=\"http://english.alarabiya.net/en/sports/2016/11/15/Saudi-Arabia-to-set-up-Sports-Development-Fund.html\">add 40,000 jobs to the economic marketplace</a> as part of <a href=\"http://english.alarabiya.net/en/perspective/features/2016/04/26/Full-text-of-Saudi-Arabia-s-Vision-2030.html\">Vision 2030</a>, a development proposal that laid out a modern, technocratic future for Saudi Arabia in which the country would be free of its heavy dependence on oil.</p> <p>Given that Saudi Arabia has historically opposed Western-influenced sports and entertainment events, these recent developments seemed to represent a significant change in the ultra-conservative Islamic nation\u2019s policies and a pivot away from the kingdom\u2019s longstanding societal limitations.</p> <p>Since Bin Salman\u2019s policy shift was imposed in 2016, the kingdom has hosted the Race of Champions (ROC) motorsport event, secured a long-term deal with the WWE that includes multiple shows a year, hosted boxing events headlined by stars like Amir Khan, hosted a PGA European Tour golf event, and even <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/13/joshua-vs-ruiz-title-fight-in-saudi-arabia-will-change-boxing-forever-promoter-says.html\">secured the rights to host</a> the December rematch between former heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua and Andy Ruiz Jr, arguably the biggest boxing pay-per-view of the year.</p> <p>While Saudi Arabia\u2019s pivot towards a more liberal society is a welcome change for the conservative kingdom, it also raises important questions about the government\u2019s relatively sudden interest in sports and whether it could be construed as a soft power tactic to help distract from the kingdom\u2019s ongoing human rights abuses and the Saudi-led coalition against Yemen \u2013 a war that killed thousands of Yemeni civilians and has left <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2019/country-chapters/yemen\">14m people at risk of starvation</a>.</p> <p>More recently, Saudi Arabia\u2019s sports-centric lobbying offensive has been the result of an urgent need for the kingdom to rebrand itself following the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a US-based Washington Post columnist and Saudi dissident who was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, where he was reportedly killed and dismembered with a bone-saw. Saudi\u2019s attorney general later stated that the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-attorney-general-says-evidence-points-to-premeditated-killing-of-khashoggi-1540466602\">murder was premeditated</a>, and the CIA <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-concludes-saudi-crown-prince-ordered-jamal-khashoggis-assassination/2018/11/16/98c89fe6-e9b2-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html\">concluded</a> that Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered Khashoggi\u2019s murder.</p> <p>In light of Saudi\u2019s recent diplomatic controversy, the kingdom has doubled down on its lobbying strategy, which, according to recently released documents, included meetings and business calls with all the leading commissioners and sports bodies in the United States.</p> <p>Saudi Arabia\u2019s General Sports Authority enlisted the services of the Churchill Ripley Group, an international consulting firm \u201c<a href=\"https://www.churchillripley.com\">specializing in growth</a>\u201d that boasts \u201cunique access to Hollywood, Silicon Valley and the Middle East\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Last month, the foreign registration documentation for Saudi Arabia\u2019s 2018 lobbying campaign in the United States were made available online. The documents shed light on the kingdom\u2019s aggressive sportswashing strategy that included meetings and business calls with the commissioners for Major League Soccer (MLS), Major League Baseball (MLB), as well as officials from the National Basketball Association (NBA), World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and the Los Angeles Olympic Committee. Saudi Arabia\u2019s strategic interest in sports and entertainment events dates back to November 2016 when crown prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the kingdom\u2019s General Sports Authority \u2013 the government body responsible for the development of sports in the kingdom \u2013 to set up a Sports Development Fund that bolstered sports activity in the country. The objectives of the fund were to privatize football clubs to increase participation, promote new sports events, and add 40,000 jobs to the economic marketplace as part of Vision 2030, a development proposal that laid out a modern, technocratic future for Saudi Arabia in which the country would be free of its heavy dependence on oil. Given that Saudi Arabia has historically opposed Western-influenced sports and entertainment events, these recent developments seemed to represent a significant change in the ultra-conservative Islamic nation\u2019s policies and a pivot away from the kingdom\u2019s longstanding societal limitations. Since Bin Salman\u2019s policy shift was imposed in 2016, the kingdom has hosted the Race of Champions (ROC) motorsport event, secured a long-term deal with the WWE that includes multiple shows a year, hosted boxing events headlined by stars like Amir Khan, hosted a PGA European Tour golf event, and even secured the rights to host the December rematch between former heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua and Andy Ruiz Jr, arguably the biggest boxing pay-per-view of the year. While Saudi Arabia\u2019s pivot towards a more liberal society is a welcome change for the conservative kingdom, it also raises important questions about the government\u2019s relatively sudden interest in sports and whether it could be construed as a soft power tactic to help distract from the kingdom\u2019s ongoing human rights abuses and the Saudi-led coalition against Yemen \u2013 a war that killed thousands of Yemeni civilians and has left 14m people at risk of starvation. More recently, Saudi Arabia\u2019s sports-centric lobbying offensive has been the result of an urgent need for the kingdom to rebrand itself following the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a US-based Washington Post columnist and Saudi dissident who was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, where he was reportedly killed and dismembered with a bone-saw. Saudi\u2019s attorney general later stated that the murder was premeditated, and the CIA concluded that Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered Khashoggi\u2019s murder. In light of Saudi\u2019s recent diplomatic controversy, the kingdom has doubled down on its lobbying strategy, which, according to recently released documents, included meetings and business calls with all the leading commissioners and sports bodies in the United States. Saudi Arabia\u2019s General Sports Authority enlisted the services of the Churchill Ripley Group, an international consulting firm \u201cspecializing in growth\u201d that boasts \u201cunique access to Hollywood, Silicon Valley and the Middle East\u201d. The LA-based firm represents the General Sports Authority by working with Saudi Princess Reema bint Bandar Al Saud, the daughter of former US ambassador Prince Bandar and the first female president of the Saudi Federation for Community Sports, to help set up meetings in the US with various companies and executives to discuss the development of Saudi\u2019s burgeoning entertainment sector. The Group\u2019s roles and responsibilities, according to the foreign registration documents, also involve negotiating favourable market terms for \u201cGSA funded initiatives,\u201d finding direct investment opportunities, and preparing Princess Reema for her high level meetings. By placing Princess Reema at the helm of this lobbying and media campaign, the Saudi government is attempting to disarm critics who bemoaned the monarchy\u2019s lack of progressive values or limited rights for women. The firm\u2019s services, which are done without a formal contract, cost the Saudi government $22,000 a month. According to the foreign registration documentation (filled out by Anna Lewis, the founder and former CEO of the Churchill Ripley firm), Princess Reema had conversations with the likes of Kobe Bryant regarding the \u201cdevelopment of basketball in Saudi Arabia\u201d; Sophie Goldschmidt, the CEO of World Surf League, regarding the \u201cdevelopment of the sport of surfing in Saudi Arabia\u201d; the CEO of Thinkwell regarding the \u201cdevelopment of a sports mall in Saudi Arabia\u201d; Bing and Twitch about advancing esports in the kingdom; the NHL commissioner on developing floor hockey in Saudi; Madison Square Garden regarding the development of \u201cstadium infrastructure\u201d; and many more. The documents also revealed that Saudi Arabia\u2019s General Sports Authority held several press events in 2018, including a public event with the Atlantic Council, the Middle East Policy Council, and another event hosted by the Saudi government for Saudi US CEO forum. Princess Reema was also interviewed by MSNBC, Reuters, NPR, ESPN, and the Washington Post as part of her media campaign to promote sports development in Saudi Arabia. She was also interviewed by CNN about women driving in Saudi Arabia. It should be noted that the documentation used for this reporting only lists the Churchill Ripley\u2019s strategic consulting proposal, as well as the business calls and meetings that took place between Princess Reema and the various sports entities. They did not include any follow-up information on the fallout of such meetings, or whether they were even successful. And yet, the documents shed light on the Saudi government\u2019s extensive sports lobbying strategy. These examples of sportswashing \u2013 a term coined by Amnesty International in 2018 to describe authoritarian regimes using sports to manipulate their international image and wash away their human rights record \u2013 highlight the lengths the Saudi monarchy is willing to go to in order to rebrand themselves in the wake of recent atrocities. It also emphasizes the scope of Saudi\u2019s ambitions, which include potentially building new stadiums, and investing in esports and less mainstream sports such as field hockey and surfing. As of the time of writing, none of the MLS, WSL, Madison Square Garden, or the Bryant Stibel investment group have responded to a request for comment from the Guardian. An NBA spokesperson said: \u201cNBA representatives regularly meet with basketball federations from around the world.\u201d This article was amended on 3 September 2019 to clarify that only representatives from the NBA attended a meeting with Saudi lobbyists in 2018, not the commissioner himself.",

Normani breezes through the verses as if skipping down a crystalline staircase, just as Grande usually does. But Normani also has inimitable charisma, evincing her supreme confidence that she\u2019s absolutely the only one who can please her man by taking a light touch to the delivery; no sledgehammer required. It\u2019s brassy and excellently sloganeering \u2013 \u201clet me be your motivation \u2026 let me be your inspiration\u201d \u2013 and has a proper dancing-in-the-rain, flirting-on-the-basketball-court smash of a video to match. <strong>LS</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vf7LUMPwHj4\">Cxloe \u2013 Sick</a></h2> <p>Australian pop-star-in-waiting Cxloe has written the anthem for an era in which fans express their love by asking their favourite stars to <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/love-death-and-begging-for-celebrities-to-kill-you\">step their necks</a> or run them over with a truck. Sick isn\u2019t about pining politely: \u201cI need you to make me sick / Love me out my mind,\u201d she pleads, channelling some of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/lorde\">Lorde</a>\u2019s dangerous intimacy, all tapered, gasping vocal delivery writhing through producer Gnash\u2019s beats. Probably not what the doctor ordered, but when life is tempered through screens and a generation of young rappers and pop stars ooze numbed pain, her demand for a visceral, mind-overhauling kind of obsession sounds quite appealing. <strong>LS</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJl_9a6dp4g\">Kim Gordon \u2013 Sketch Artist</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"608cab407266562792e15cccc656ff14e76e6bba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/608cab407266562792e15cccc656ff14e76e6bba/0_91_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kim Gordon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kim Gordon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Natalia Mantini</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/mar/06/sign-up-for-the-sleeve-notes-email\">Sign up for the Sleeve Notes email: music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Like bonfires and birthday candles, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/kim-gordon\">Kim Gordon</a>\u2019s voice has a particular char that has become more distinctive with age.

It\u2019s an unnerving landscape that becomes strangely moving when a pocket of reflection opens up, Gordon musing about a day \u201cin the sunlight, dreaming in a tent\u201d.

For their ninth album, the group rehearsed in the Moroccan Sahara en route to recording in Mauritania. You can almost hear a sand-laden breeze waft through the background on Kel Tinawen as singer Ibrahim Ag Alhabib employs his gravelly baritone as a counterpoint to indie star Cass McCombs\u2019s spangly guitars, a chorus of backing vocals keeping the mid-tempo groove undulating. It is imaginative music, a song to place the listener squarely within Tinariwen\u2019s universe, regardless of where you are listening. <strong>AK</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LwX7GCE5rI\">Miley Cyrus \u2013 Slide Away</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a1e713a57cd4e0e22daae0aa98364c7365c6878b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1e713a57cd4e0e22daae0aa98364c7365c6878b/0_0_4667_2800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Miley Cyrus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Miley Cyrus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Polk/Variety/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not a tribute to Definitely Maybe on its 25th anniversary \u2013 though admirably brazen in title \u2013 Slide Away is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/miley-cyrus\">Miley Cyrus</a>\u2019s eulogy for her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/sep/17/miley-cyrus-liam-hemsworth-split\">marriage to actor Liam Hemsworth</a>.

Set to release their debut album on Pan this autumn, they came up through the city\u2019s rave scene (the one that birthed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/grimes\">Grimes</a> a decade ago), distinguishing themselves by pairing Rochman\u2019s hardware-focused production with unusual live vocals by Vargas, who rails in Spanish against power, surveillance and politics. While Vargas has cited the influence of their childhood exposure to cumbia on Pelada\u2019s sound, Ajetreo (hustle and bustle) hews closer to the hectic, compressed kuduro sound that travelled from Angola to Lisbon\u2019s electronic scene: Rochman gives the beat a junkyard patina that offers a playful contrast with his slippery pitch-shifting. <strong>LS</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l-2pCTzTWA\">Binker Golding \u2013 \u2026 And I Like Your Feathers</a></h2> <p>Since winning the Mobo for best jazz act in 2015 with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/sep/13/binker-moses-review-boyd-golding-london-jazz-stars\">drummer Moses Boyd</a>, saxophonist Binker Golding has become one of the key sidemen in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/08/british-jazz-invasion-moses-boyd-matthew-halsall-nubya-garcia\">renascent London jazz scene</a>, blowing coruscating sheets of free improvisation with Boyd, tasteful balladry with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/05/zara-mcfarlane-arise-review-jazz-sensibilities-highlight-a-class-act\">singer Zara McFarlane</a> and challenging bebop with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/18/elliot-galvin-the-influencing-machine-cd-review-brilliantly-executed-bright-ideas\">pianist Elliot Galvin</a>.

      "bodyText": "Normani \u2013 Motivation The former Fifth Harmony member\u2019s best single to date bears clear evidence of co-writer Ariana Grande\u2019s influence. Normani breezes through the verses as if skipping down a crystalline staircase, just as Grande usually does. But Normani also has inimitable charisma, evincing her supreme confidence that she\u2019s absolutely the only one who can please her man by taking a light touch to the delivery; no sledgehammer required. It\u2019s brassy and excellently sloganeering \u2013 \u201clet me be your motivation \u2026 let me be your inspiration\u201d \u2013 and has a proper dancing-in-the-rain, flirting-on-the-basketball-court smash of a video to match. LS Cxloe \u2013 Sick Australian pop-star-in-waiting Cxloe has written the anthem for an era in which fans express their love by asking their favourite stars to step their necks or run them over with a truck. Sick isn\u2019t about pining politely: \u201cI need you to make me sick / Love me out my mind,\u201d she pleads, channelling some of Lorde\u2019s dangerous intimacy, all tapered, gasping vocal delivery writhing through producer Gnash\u2019s beats. Probably not what the doctor ordered, but when life is tempered through screens and a generation of young rappers and pop stars ooze numbed pain, her demand for a visceral, mind-overhauling kind of obsession sounds quite appealing. LS Kim Gordon \u2013 Sketch Artist Like bonfires and birthday candles, Kim Gordon\u2019s voice has a particular char that has become more distinctive with age. Now 66, she is releasing her first solo album, No Home Record, and the lead single places her signature ashy tone front and centre. She declaims menacingly and obliquely \u2013 \u201caliveness is an objection, affected me\u201d \u2013 as a bass clarinet shudders like the surface of dark water, and percussive blasts detonate at random. It\u2019s an unnerving landscape that becomes strangely moving when a pocket of reflection opens up, Gordon musing about a day \u201cin the sunlight, dreaming in a tent\u201d. The sound of forlorn acoustic guitar appears, seeming to mock her bucolic reverie. LS Tinariwen feat. Cass McCombs \u2013 Kel Tinawen Tuareg rockers Tinariwen have always made music that reflects the desert setting of its creation: loose, sparsely populated and full of stark contrasts. For their ninth album, the group rehearsed in the Moroccan Sahara en route to recording in Mauritania. You can almost hear a sand-laden breeze waft through the background on Kel Tinawen as singer Ibrahim Ag Alhabib employs his gravelly baritone as a counterpoint to indie star Cass McCombs\u2019s spangly guitars, a chorus of backing vocals keeping the mid-tempo groove undulating. It is imaginative music, a song to place the listener squarely within Tinariwen\u2019s universe, regardless of where you are listening. AK Miley Cyrus \u2013 Slide Away Not a tribute to Definitely Maybe on its 25th anniversary \u2013 though admirably brazen in title \u2013 Slide Away is Miley Cyrus\u2019s eulogy for her marriage to actor Liam Hemsworth. And it\u2019s beautiful. Her dramatic vocal turn in the verses traces the scale of what they had \u2013 paradise, paralysing \u2013 only to shrink again, conveying the sense of necessary retreat in her lovely, limpid chorus: \u201cSo won\u2019t you slide away? / Back to the ocean, I\u2019ll go back to the city lights.\u201d Like Ariana Grande\u2019s Thank U, Next, it\u2019s a dignified, adult breakup song \u2013 not score-settling, but honouring what was before moving on. LS Pelada \u2013 Ajetreo Pelada are Montreal electronic duo Chris Vargas and Tobias Rochman.

LS Binker Golding \u2013 \u2026 And I Like Your Feathers Since winning the Mobo for best jazz act in 2015 with drummer Moses Boyd, saxophonist Binker Golding has become one of the key sidemen in the renascent London jazz scene, blowing coruscating sheets of free improvisation with Boyd, tasteful balladry with singer Zara McFarlane and challenging bebop with pianist Elliot Galvin. With his first quartet album as bandleader out in September, single ... And I Like Your Feathers is a subtly intricate number featuring a breezy interplay between Golding and bassist Daniel Casimir. It\u2019s straight-ahead jazz but loses none of its potency for it; Golding shows that his playing isn\u2019t to be relegated to a dinner party background.

      "body": "<h2>1) David Luiz typifies Arsenal defensive issues</h2> <p>You have to wonder what was going through the minds of the Arsenal hierarchy over the summer when they belatedly decided that David Luiz was the answer to their defensive issues. There is no doubting the positives of the Brazilian\u2019s play; David Luiz can change games with his passing and prowess in the opposition box but his propensity for switching off is there for all to see. Unai Emery played three defensive midfielders at home <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/01/arsenal-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-match-report\">against Tottenham</a>, and one suspects he has limited faith in his defence, as proved by the counterattack for the opener, which saw David Luiz wander off and an unmarked Christian Eriksen tap into an empty net after a goalkeeping error. At least January is not too far away and Arsenal can plan once more to solve their problems, preferably not with a deadline-day signing. <strong>Will Unwin</strong></p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/01/arsenal-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">\u2022 Match report: Arsenal 2-2 Tottenham Hotspur</a></em></p> <h2>2) Fabinho\u2019s influence growing for Liverpool</h2> <p>There is a view among observers that Liverpool\u2019s current team contains world-class talent in goal, defence and attack, but that their midfield is made up of carthorses who basically run around a lot. It\u2019s often said and always wrong, and anyone in doubt of that should watch Fabinho\u2019s display <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/31/burnley-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">in the victory against Burnley</a>. The Brazilian was outstanding in a defensive midfield role, combining tactical maturity with natural athleticism. He completed 82.3% of his passes, won 66.7% of his tackles, made five recoveries and even found the time to earn a free\u2011kick. The 25\u2011year\u2011old has become a fundamental figure for the European champions and deserves to be recognised as one of the best players in his position right now. <strong>Sachin Nakrani</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/31/burnley-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Burnley 0-3 Liverpool</a></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>3) Azpilicueta has lost his reliability</h2> <p>Chelsea\u2019s inexperience is one reason why they are dropping points but Frank Lampard also has concerns over one of his most seasoned players. C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta has gone off the boil in recent months and the right-back had another poor game in the 2-2 draw with Sheffield United. The 30-year-old\u2019s lack of confidence was evident when Enda Stevens zigzagged past him to tee up Callum Robinson just after half\u2011time, and he was unable to block the cross that led to Kurt Zouma\u2019s own goal handing United a point in the 89th minute. Those slips will surely not have escaped Lampard\u2019s attention and although Azpilicueta has mostly been a reliable performer since joining in 2012, he could benefit from a spell out of the side. The case grows every week for Reece James, another of Chelsea\u2019s aspiring academy products, to be given a chance when he has recovered from an ankle injury. <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/31/chelsea-sheffield-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Chelsea 2-2 Sheffield United</a></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"03bbddb3e226a749611484f6a27387779977a2e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03bbddb3e226a749611484f6a27387779977a2e2/0_148_3605_2164/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cesar Azpilicueta struggled against Sheffield United\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta struggled against Sheffield United.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Javier Garc\u00eda/BPI/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>4) Palace flying high while lacking firepower</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/10/premier-league-la-liga-bundesliga-serie-a-and-ligue-1-top-scorers-2019-20\">Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A and Ligue 1 top scorers 2019-20</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Roy Hodgson left his post-match media duties on Saturday night to walk straight into a meeting with one of Crystal Palace\u2019s major shareholders, the American Josh Harris.

In February 2019, the official running \u201coperation sovereign borders\u201d told a Senate estimates committee there had been 32 vessels intercepted since December 2013 \u201cand the safe return of 800 people to their country of departure or origin\u201d.</p> <p>There could have been other ventures since this time, but in any case, The Australian on Monday morning added another five vessels to this tally, all from Sri Lanka. According to the report, all of these ventures had been intercepted successfully by Australian officials, or disrupted by Sri Lankan officials.</p> <p>Now call me crazy, but that sounds like a policy working \u2013 delivering on its objectives \u2013 rather than a government battling an outbreak of shock horror, gasp, pass the smelling salts, somebody DO SOMETHING, look at those weak bastards soft on border protection, which weak bastards, look it hardly matters, let\u2019s just go with this.</p> <p>Sticking with crazy, the same news report overlaid the \u201csurge\u201d (of failed ventures from Sri Lanka) with the medevac repeal vote, which wasn\u2019t expected until later in the year, but now might happen when parliament resumes next week, because ... well it wasn\u2019t entirely clear why that would happen, at least in the world of facts.</p> <p>It certainly wasn\u2019t clear to Jacqui Lambie, the critical swing vote in the Senate, who had heard nothing about fast-tracking the medevac repeal vote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/02/medevac-repeal-bill-jackie-lambie-warns-coalition-against-fast-tracking-vote\">until she read it on the front page of a national newspaper</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s also not clear what rushing to repeal the medevac regime had to do with \u201cPeter Dutton courageously battles new sovereignty shock\u201d.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email\">Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</a></p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Signup\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4148\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia's Morning Mail\" data-form-description=\"Get our editors' pick of the biggest headlines every weekday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The medevac regime, just to be clear, won\u2019t benefit any sneaky new arrivals who arrive as a consequence of a \u201cSri Lankan asylum surge\u201d (of failed people smuggling ventures). Why? Because the current procedures apply only to the cohort of people already in a regional processing country, not to any newcomers.</p> <p>Again, in the world of facts.</p> <p>Scott Morrison fronted the media on Monday morning and was asked whether people would be rightly suspicious about the timing of the release of this information (through a newspaper) \u201cconsidering the current debate regarding the Tamil family\u201d.</p> <p>If you\u2019ve somehow missed this debate, there has been an outpouring of criticism over the past 72 hours about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/02/peter-dutton-hits-back-at-labor-opportunists-over-tamil-family-facing-deportation\">the government\u2019s attempt to deport a Tamil couple and their Australian-born children</a>.</p> <p>Strange sort of coincidence that a front-page story screaming The Sri Lankans Are Coming might show up, given that; almost like someone might be looking to change a conversation that wasn\u2019t playing entirely their way.</p> <p>Morrison was asked the obvious question at his press conference on Monday. Can you understand why some of the Australian public would be cynical about the timing? \u201cNo,\u201d was the response.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/31/we-implore-them-the-biloela-tamil-family-and-their-five-day-reprieve-from-deportation\">'We're a polite town': rage in Biloela as Tamil family's fate in Peter Dutton's hands</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Just in case you\u2019ve forgotten, Morrison was the ministerial architect of <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2013/s3887267.htm\">the controversial \u201con water matters\u201d regime</a>, where the government point-blank refused to disclose what was going on under its \u201coperation sovereign borders\u201d policy.</p> <p>But now the prime minister thought it was OK to disclose what was going on, as long as it was after the fact. \u201cIt\u2019s important that Australians understand the full perspective of the decisions that the government has to take,\u201d Morrison said, apparently heralding a change of approach.</p> <p>A reporter then bowled up the next obvious question. \u201cIs it now the government\u2019s policy that you will release information about boat arrivals four weeks after they come \u2013 is that now ...\u201d</p> <p>Well no, actually, it wasn\u2019t.</p> <p>Morrison said the government released information \u201cas it believes it\u2019s important to do so\u201d.</p> <p>Important <em>to whom</em> wasn\u2019t specified.</p> <p>While Morrison was pivoting on Monday to a policy of selective disclosure when it was \u201cimportant\u201d, there was also another interesting rhetorical shift.</p> <p>This government prides itself on stopping the boats. This has always been a silly soundbite, because the truth is the boats haven\u2019t stopped. But the government has certainly been hugely successful in creating an impression that they have stopped.</p> <p>Now it seems the political times require a different, more nuanced impression. Morrison said on Monday people smuggling never stopped seeking to pursue its business, \u201cit just came up against a government that was able to defeat it time and time and time and time again\u201d.</p> <p>Being forthright about some of the ventures, \u201cI think that keeps the issue of the ever-present threat of illegal arrivals to Australia foremost in the public\u2019s mind\u201d.</p> <p>Now why would that particular issue need to be foremost in the public\u2019s mind?</p> <p>Could partisan politics possibly be the answer to the question?</p> <ul> <li><p>Katharine Murphy is Guardian Australia\u2019s political editor</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s not at all clear that there is a problem, but let\u2019s say the Morrison government was, in fact, struggling manfully to defend Australia\u2019s sovereignty in the face of a \u201cSri Lankan asylum surge\u201d as The Australian reported on Monday morning. If you are a government, and you face an actual problem, it\u2019s generally best to be straightforward about it, releasing information in orderly and transparent fashion so considered judgments can be made, otherwise people might suspect you are fully intent on the selective presentation of information to try to control the narrative. People might even (as one reporter suggested to Scott Morrison on Monday morning) get cynical about it, given stories about surges in boat arrivals do tend to arrive at politically convenient times; a happy sort of coincidence. Anyway let\u2019s lay out the facts as far as they can be known, or documented. According to the parliamentary library, there were 33 boat turnbacks between December 2013 and June 2018. In February 2019, the official running \u201coperation sovereign borders\u201d told a Senate estimates committee there had been 32 vessels intercepted since December 2013 \u201cand the safe return of 800 people to their country of departure or origin\u201d. There could have been other ventures since this time, but in any case, The Australian on Monday morning added another five vessels to this tally, all from Sri Lanka. According to the report, all of these ventures had been intercepted successfully by Australian officials, or disrupted by Sri Lankan officials. Now call me crazy, but that sounds like a policy working \u2013 delivering on its objectives \u2013 rather than a government battling an outbreak of shock horror, gasp, pass the smelling salts, somebody DO SOMETHING, look at those weak bastards soft on border protection, which weak bastards, look it hardly matters, let\u2019s just go with this. Sticking with crazy, the same news report overlaid the \u201csurge\u201d (of failed ventures from Sri Lanka) with the medevac repeal vote, which wasn\u2019t expected until later in the year, but now might happen when parliament resumes next week, because ... well it wasn\u2019t entirely clear why that would happen, at least in the world of facts. It certainly wasn\u2019t clear to Jacqui Lambie, the critical swing vote in the Senate, who had heard nothing about fast-tracking the medevac repeal vote until she read it on the front page of a national newspaper. It\u2019s also not clear what rushing to repeal the medevac regime had to do with \u201cPeter Dutton courageously battles new sovereignty shock\u201d. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The medevac regime, just to be clear, won\u2019t benefit any sneaky new arrivals who arrive as a consequence of a \u201cSri Lankan asylum surge\u201d (of failed people smuggling ventures). Why? Because the current procedures apply only to the cohort of people already in a regional processing country, not to any newcomers. Again, in the world of facts. Scott Morrison fronted the media on Monday morning and was asked whether people would be rightly suspicious about the timing of the release of this information (through a newspaper) \u201cconsidering the current debate regarding the Tamil family\u201d. If you\u2019ve somehow missed this debate, there has been an outpouring of criticism over the past 72 hours about the government\u2019s attempt to deport a Tamil couple and their Australian-born children. Strange sort of coincidence that a front-page story screaming The Sri Lankans Are Coming might show up, given that; almost like someone might be looking to change a conversation that wasn\u2019t playing entirely their way. Morrison was asked the obvious question at his press conference on Monday. Can you understand why some of the Australian public would be cynical about the timing? \u201cNo,\u201d was the response. Just in case you\u2019ve forgotten, Morrison was the ministerial architect of the controversial \u201con water matters\u201d regime, where the government point-blank refused to disclose what was going on under its \u201coperation sovereign borders\u201d policy. But now the prime minister thought it was OK to disclose what was going on, as long as it was after the fact. \u201cIt\u2019s important that Australians understand the full perspective of the decisions that the government has to take,\u201d Morrison said, apparently heralding a change of approach. A reporter then bowled up the next obvious question. \u201cIs it now the government\u2019s policy that you will release information about boat arrivals four weeks after they come \u2013 is that now ...\u201d Well no, actually, it wasn\u2019t. Morrison said the government released information \u201cas it believes it\u2019s important to do so\u201d. Important to whom wasn\u2019t specified. While Morrison was pivoting on Monday to a policy of selective disclosure when it was \u201cimportant\u201d, there was also another interesting rhetorical shift. This government prides itself on stopping the boats. This has always been a silly soundbite, because the truth is the boats haven\u2019t stopped. But the government has certainly been hugely successful in creating an impression that they have stopped. Now it seems the political times require a different, more nuanced impression. Morrison said on Monday people smuggling never stopped seeking to pursue its business, \u201cit just came up against a government that was able to defeat it time and time and time and time again\u201d. Being forthright about some of the ventures, \u201cI think that keeps the issue of the ever-present threat of illegal arrivals to Australia foremost in the public\u2019s mind\u201d. Now why would that particular issue need to be foremost in the public\u2019s mind? Could partisan politics possibly be the answer to the question?

During the war the family were to lose their home twice as the city and its docks became a prime target. My mother was wearing a new coat so when her father ordered everyone to hit the ground, she refused. A bomb splinter gouged one side of her back. A female ambulance driver risked her life to drive my mother to hospital through the raid.</p> <p>I was born in 1948. My mother and father lived in a bedsit and saved a few shillings a week for her confinement.

There was a wariness, a weariness.\u201d</p> <p>Baby boomers, like me, were born out of \u2013 or because of \u2013 that weariness. We now make up one in five of the population (more than 12 million). This huge postwar bulge, \u201cthe pig in the python\u201d, created by those born in the years between 1944-64, is a permanent irritation to many not least because we are accused of making off with the spoils (one in five is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c69b49de-1368-11e9-a581-4ff78404524e\" title=\"\">a millionaire</a> while 16% of the UK population lives in relative poverty).

At 18, I was part of the so-called swinging 60s, sex and drugs and rock\u2019n\u2019roll, miniskirts, Beatles, sit-ins, women\u2019s lib, protest, anti-establishment \u2013 the counter-culture. (The counter-culture combined with consumerism, described by American academic Theodore Roszak as \u201ca resounding market success\u201d).</p> <p>Thanks to the expansion in higher education, in 1967, I was about to go to a redbrick university, on a full grant and paying no tuition fees. My mother had left school at 14 and became a tailor\u2019s apprentice and, to me, in 1967, she was a lost cause, entombed in domesticity. Then, the arrogance of youth meant she and I belonged to alien (and sometimes hostile) tribes. Only years later did I come to realise how much we had in common: how the experience of war had shaped my aspirations and frustrations and my generation\u2019s rejection of the notions that women and the working class should know their place \u2013 just as surely as it had shaped hers.</p> <p>\u201cBritish women have proved themselves in this war\u2026 they have died at their gun posts,\u201d instructed a US war department booklet given to every soldier entering Britain, equipped with supplies of nylon stockings, fags and chocolate. \u201cWhen you see a girl in uniform with a bit of ribbon on her tunic, remember she didn\u2019t get it for knitting more socks than anyone else in Ipswich.\u201d War, for women in Britain, broke down traditional barriers between the public and the private, the domestic and the \u201creal\u201d world. Women showed guts.</p> <p>Only in Britain, from 1941, were so many women conscripted; the cage door had opened. In 1939, 5.1 million females were in work. Four years later, that number had swollen to 7.25 million \u2013 nine in 10 single women and eight in 10 wives had a wage packet. Even earlier, my mum had become one of the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Women-Who-Went-Eric-Taylor/dp/0586207708\" title=\"\">2,000 women a week</a> who enlisted, in her case in the newly established Women\u2019s Auxiliary Air Force. Posted to Yorkshire, she left her father\u2019s house as \u201ca mobile woman\u201d, independent, for the very first time. Much to the consternation of the trade unions, women took over what had previously been regarded as out of bounds for \u201cthe weaker sex\u201d, highly skilled \u201cmen\u2019s work\u201d, including <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nationalising-Femininity-Culture-sexuality-British/dp/0719083508\" title=\"\">300,000 jobs </a>in the explosives and chemical industries and half a million posts in the engineering and metal industries. John G Winant, US ambassador to London, said: \u201cThis war, more than any other war in history, is a woman\u2019s war.\u201d </p> <p>Working-class women had always needed to work but before the war more than a million had been employed as \u201cdomestics\u201d. Now they were in the male labour force. Mona Marshall, a nursemaid turned steelworker, said: \u201cThe war made me stand on my own two feet.\u201d Ellen McCulloch, a <a href=\"http://www.massobs.org.uk/\" title=\"\">women\u2019s officer </a>at the TGWU, said in 1942 of her members: \u201cThey began to realise that they weren\u2019t second-class citizens.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2446d10223b5cb0792a486e254034d02f178d1a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2446d10223b5cb0792a486e254034d02f178d1a2/0_471_5186_3112/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Secondary modern school 1960\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Secondary modern schools, like this one in Sheffield in 1960, offered new educational opportunities for working-class children.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Heritage Images/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>War also exposed, for all to see, inequality. Women earned half the male wage. In 1943, in the Rolls-Royce factory in Hillington near Glasgow, women went on strike. They earned 43 shillings a week, the men 30 shillings more. Backed by the men, they <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Peoples-War-Peter-Lewis/dp/0423019503\" title=\"\">won</a> \u2013 wages were paid according to the job, not gender. </p> <p>\u201cIt is impossible to confront a common condition before you have recognised it,\u201d feminist Sheila Rowbotham was to <a href=\"https://www.versobooks.com/books/1768-woman-s-consciousness-man-s-world\" title=\"\">write</a> in 1973, about women waking up to the position they were in. \u201cYou can\u2019t begin to find your own power until you have consciously recognised your non-power.\u201d </p> <p>War and national reconstruction meant women had been <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nationalising-Femininity-Culture-sexuality-British/dp/0719083508\" title=\"\">let out of the home</a> but only on temporary licence to fulfil \u201cmasculine\u201d duties. But once out, some at least began to perceive that the problems they faced weren\u2019t down to their \u201cnatural\u201d inferiority but the system itself. That awareness set off ripples that created a tidal wave in the sixties.</p> <p>Dislocation is a theme of all wars. In Britain in the second world war, mothers left home for work; men went to the front; children in London were evacuated. \u201cThey call this spring, mum,\u201d one child wrote to his mother from the countryside, \u201cand they have one down here every year.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"95deb07748c7e0b3a5e18f387dfb283f557e9efa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95deb07748c7e0b3a5e18f387dfb283f557e9efa/0_10_693_866/400.jpg\" alt=\"Yvonne Roberts and father John\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yvonne Roberts and father John, May 1949.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yvonne Roberts</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the sixties, we chanted \u201cMake Love Not War\u201d. In the war, they were making <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_People_s_War.html?id=Wim0UKS5HNwC&amp;redir_esc=y\" title=\"\">love</a>. The number of illegitimate babies tripled to 16.1 per thousand in 1945. War forced men, women and children out of their comfort zone \u2013 gender, geography (between 1939-45 there were almost 35m changes of addresses in England and Wales) and class contributed to a kaleidoscope of <a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/austerity-britain-1945-1951-9781408809075/\" title=\"\">new experiences</a> and nobody knew where the pattern would settle \u2013 except that it had to be better than the squalor, poverty and social injustice that had prevailed before the war. </p> <p>Then came the Valium of the fifties when the position of women appeared to regress. They were told to go back home; nurseries were closed. But something had irreversibly changed. Women were carving out a different existence and so too, willingly or not, did the two million men returning from the forces.</p> <p>\u201cIn place of the traditional working-class husband as mean with his money as he was callous in sex, forcing unwanted babies on his wife, has come a man who wheels the pram on Saturday morning,\u201d wrote Michael Young and Peter Wilmott, egging the pudding a touch, in their <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rtS11AWhvwgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Michael+Young+and+Peter+Wilmots+Bethnal+Green&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi-vsDJuaLjAhVTTxUIHaOrAlAQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Michael%20Young%20and%20Peter%20Wilmots%20Bethnal%20Green&amp;f=false\" title=\"\">study</a> of London\u2019s Bethnal Green. </p> <p>Wages rose (as did inflation), hire purchase \u2013 \u201cthe never-never\u201d \u2013 arrived and ensured that \u201ca \u2018care free kitchen\u2019, was awash with products to keep \u2018the little lady\u2019 amused\u201d. Economist John Kenneth Galbraith in 1958\u2019s <em>The Affluent Society</em> described what we now have again, \u201cprivate affluence, public squalor\u201d. In Britain the Conservatives built houses but also created new estates that were deserts not neighbourhoods. </p> <p>As we lived in fear of the H-bomb and annihilation, influential child psychologist John Bowlby insisted that a good mother stayed at home with her child. However, while in 1931 10% of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Only-Halfway-Paradise-Post-War-1945-1968/dp/0422768804\" title=\"\">married women</a> were in work, that rose sharply to 21% in 1951 and 47% in 1972. My mother became a gifted, but unqualified teacher, and I saw her at her happiest, if not without maternal guilt. \u201cIt\u2019s particularly difficult to be a woman just at present,\u201d said a character in Rosamund Lehmann\u2019s 1953 book, <em>The Echoing Grove</em>. \u201cOne feels so transitional and fluctuating\u2026 so I suppose do men.\u201d</p> <p>Money, opportunity (albeit delivered by the carnage of war) and access to education remoulded the working class \u2013 as did the advent of the teenager, the stripling baby boomer, who had plenty left over from a \u201cgood\u201d wage after handing over their keep to mam to invest in mod, teddy boy or rocker gear. The civil rights, anti-authoritarian, liberal, permissive (though not as permissive as the myths have it) attitudes that heralded the sixties were rooted in the experiences of war, the affluence of the fifties and full employment. \u201cTune in, turn on, drop out\u201d had the insurance that there was always a job waiting when flower power waned.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"edf1a0986cca6731612025b22d4054855d29a3b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/edf1a0986cca6731612025b22d4054855d29a3b4/0_255_2564_1538/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Look Back in Anger\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Working-class lives: the 1959 film of Look Back in Anger, with Claire Bloom, Richard Burton and Gary Raymond.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ronald Grant Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the beginning of the sixties too, the prewar deference \u2013 diluted in the second world war as the <a href=\"https://www.history.ox.ac.uk/people/professor-selina-todd\" title=\"\">inequities</a> of the class system were laid bare \u2013 translated into a cultural and intellectual acceptance of the working class. For the first time, people from my parents\u2019 backgrounds saw their working class-lives mirrored in plays, television, books and <em>Coronation Street</em>, watched by my mother, always the stoic, until just before her 90th birthday. Out went plots set in house parties and country estates, in came Arthur Seaton as the bicycle worker in Alan Sillitoe\u2019s <em>Saturday Night and Sunday Morning</em>. \u201cThe air crackled with a new energy,\u201d said Stan Barstow, author of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/aug/01/stan-barstow-obituary\" title=\"\">A Kind of Loving</a></em>.</p> <p>Nineteen-year-old Shelagh Delaney, a theatre usher, wrote a \u201ckitchen sink\u201d play, <em>A Taste of </em><em>Honey</em><em>,</em> that wonderfully tells the story of Jo, a 17-year-old working-class girl from Salford having a mixed-race \u201cbastard\u201d baby, befriended by a gay man (at a time when homosexuality was illegal). Delaney\u2019s targets were poverty, homophobia, misogyny and racism. The programme notes for the original production said of Delaney: \u201cShe is the antithesis of London\u2019s \u2018angry young men\u2019. She knows what she is angry about.\u201d</p> <p>In John Osborn\u2019s <em>Look Back in Anger</em>, Jimmy, the sweet stall holder and weekend intellectual, rages at his posh wife, Alice. She tells her father, a retired colonel: \u201cYou\u2019re hurt because everything has changed. Jimmy is hurt because everything is the same. And neither of you can face it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe scorn which the angry young men hurled at the establishment was a class resentment but one devoid of any class consciousness,\u201d feminist Lynne Segal writes perceptively in <em>Radical Happiness: Moments of Collective Joy</em>. In the decades that followed, shaped by race riots, feminism, Thatcherism, the miners\u2019 strike and the collapse of heavy industry and trade unionism, working-class solidarity appeared to fracture. The rise of what\u2019s now called identity politics began.</p> <p>In 1961, sociologist Ferdynand Zweig noted presciently: \u201cWorking-class life finds itself on the move towards new middle-class values and middle-class existence\u2026 the change can only be described as\u2026 the development of new aspirations and cravings.\u201d My mother\u2019s ambition was to move up the social ladder when that was still possible.</p> <p>Today, paradoxically, middle class by education and income, I anchor myself in the working class. And I\u2019m not alone. In 2016, an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jun/29/most-brits-regard-themselves-as-working-class-survey-finds\" title=\"\">Oxford University survey</a> found that the majority of Britons called themselves working class. Nostalgia? Or a yearning for more than looking after number one?</p> <p>From the Blitz to Brexit is a tenuous thread but it is visible. The decades since 1939 have been conflicting and contradictory. In 1968, student and feminist Mary Ingham records in her <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Now-are-Thirty-Breakthrough-Generation/dp/0413493008\" title=\"\">diary</a>: \u201cWhy am I not happy and married with two kids? Why am I aimlessly wasting away?\u201d Individualism and austerity have shifted blame from a profoundly unequal and unjust society, widely acknowledged in the war, to character failings.</p> <p>We have moved from criticism of the systemic to the personal. But in tribute to my parents\u2019 memory, I do believe that what existed at the heart of the people\u2019s war still continues. Namely, a hope that in collective effort, under the banner of freedom and fairness, something better can be built.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In 1942, aged 18, my mother was running for her life with her father, mother and siblings, heading for an air-raid shelter as bombs pulverised Portsmouth, turning the city into \u201ca tomb of darkness\u201d as one diarist recorded. During the war the family were to lose their home twice as the city and its docks became a prime target. My mother was wearing a new coat so when her father ordered everyone to hit the ground, she refused. A bomb splinter gouged one side of her back. A female ambulance driver risked her life to drive my mother to hospital through the raid. I was born in 1948. My mother and father lived in a bedsit and saved a few shillings a week for her confinement. And then, like millions who had endured six years of war, they had their just rewards. \u201cThe destruction is so awful and the people so wonderful, they deserve a better world,\u201d wrote the future Queen Elizabeth to her grandmother, Mary. On 5 July, the NHS was born. It no longer cost a couple dearly to have a baby. I came along a few weeks later, a citizen of the new \u201ccradle to the grave\u201d welfare state. As historian Asa Briggs said: \u201cWar has necessitated welfare.\u201d Doris Lessing arrived in London from South Africa in the year I was born. \u201cNo cafes, no good restaurants. Clothes were still \u2018austerity\u2019, from the war dismal and ugly,\u201d she wrote. \u201cEveryone was indoors by 10 and the streets were empty\u2026 Any conversation tended to drift towards the war like an animal licking a sore place. There was a wariness, a weariness.\u201d Baby boomers, like me, were born out of \u2013 or because of \u2013 that weariness. We now make up one in five of the population (more than 12 million). This huge postwar bulge, \u201cthe pig in the python\u201d, created by those born in the years between 1944-64, is a permanent irritation to many not least because we are accused of making off with the spoils (one in five is a millionaire while 16% of the UK population lives in relative poverty). Eighty years since the second world war began and 74 years since it ended, we are now moving into our seventies. Time is running out to reconsider how war shaped not only the lives of our parents but our lives too. At 18, I was part of the so-called swinging 60s, sex and drugs and rock\u2019n\u2019roll, miniskirts, Beatles, sit-ins, women\u2019s lib, protest, anti-establishment \u2013 the counter-culture. (The counter-culture combined with consumerism, described by American academic Theodore Roszak as \u201ca resounding market success\u201d). Thanks to the expansion in higher education, in 1967, I was about to go to a redbrick university, on a full grant and paying no tuition fees. My mother had left school at 14 and became a tailor\u2019s apprentice and, to me, in 1967, she was a lost cause, entombed in domesticity. Then, the arrogance of youth meant she and I belonged to alien (and sometimes hostile) tribes. Only years later did I come to realise how much we had in common: how the experience of war had shaped my aspirations and frustrations and my generation\u2019s rejection of the notions that women and the working class should know their place \u2013 just as surely as it had shaped hers. \u201cBritish women have proved themselves in this war\u2026 they have died at their gun posts,\u201d instructed a US war department booklet given to every soldier entering Britain, equipped with supplies of nylon stockings, fags and chocolate. \u201cWhen you see a girl in uniform with a bit of ribbon on her tunic, remember she didn\u2019t get it for knitting more socks than anyone else in Ipswich.\u201d War, for women in Britain, broke down traditional barriers between the public and the private, the domestic and the \u201creal\u201d world. Women showed guts. Only in Britain, from 1941, were so many women conscripted; the cage door had opened. In 1939, 5.1 million females were in work. Four years later, that number had swollen to 7.25 million \u2013 nine in 10 single women and eight in 10 wives had a wage packet. Even earlier, my mum had become one of the 2,000 women a week who enlisted, in her case in the newly established Women\u2019s Auxiliary Air Force. Posted to Yorkshire, she left her father\u2019s house as \u201ca mobile woman\u201d, independent, for the very first time. Much to the consternation of the trade unions, women took over what had previously been regarded as out of bounds for \u201cthe weaker sex\u201d, highly skilled \u201cmen\u2019s work\u201d, including 300,000 jobs in the explosives and chemical industries and half a million posts in the engineering and metal industries. John G Winant, US ambassador to London, said: \u201cThis war, more than any other war in history, is a woman\u2019s war.\u201d Working-class women had always needed to work but before the war more than a million had been employed as \u201cdomestics\u201d. Now they were in the male labour force. Mona Marshall, a nursemaid turned steelworker, said: \u201cThe war made me stand on my own two feet.\u201d Ellen McCulloch, a women\u2019s officer at the TGWU, said in 1942 of her members: \u201cThey began to realise that they weren\u2019t second-class citizens.\u201d War also exposed, for all to see, inequality. Women earned half the male wage. In 1943, in the Rolls-Royce factory in Hillington near Glasgow, women went on strike. They earned 43 shillings a week, the men 30 shillings more. Backed by the men, they won \u2013 wages were paid according to the job, not gender. \u201cIt is impossible to confront a common condition before you have recognised it,\u201d feminist Sheila Rowbotham was to write in 1973, about women waking up to the position they were in. \u201cYou can\u2019t begin to find your own power until you have consciously recognised your non-power.\u201d War and national reconstruction meant women had been let out of the home but only on temporary licence to fulfil \u201cmasculine\u201d duties. But once out, some at least began to perceive that the problems they faced weren\u2019t down to their \u201cnatural\u201d inferiority but the system itself. That awareness set off ripples that created a tidal wave in the sixties. Dislocation is a theme of all wars. In Britain in the second world war, mothers left home for work; men went to the front; children in London were evacuated. \u201cThey call this spring, mum,\u201d one child wrote to his mother from the countryside, \u201cand they have one down here every year.\u201d In the sixties, we chanted \u201cMake Love Not War\u201d. In the war, they were making love. The number of illegitimate babies tripled to 16.1 per thousand in 1945. War forced men, women and children out of their comfort zone \u2013 gender, geography (between 1939-45 there were almost 35m changes of addresses in England and Wales) and class contributed to a kaleidoscope of new experiences and nobody knew where the pattern would settle \u2013 except that it had to be better than the squalor, poverty and social injustice that had prevailed before the war. Then came the Valium of the fifties when the position of women appeared to regress. They were told to go back home; nurseries were closed. But something had irreversibly changed. Women were carving out a different existence and so too, willingly or not, did the two million men returning from the forces. \u201cIn place of the traditional working-class husband as mean with his money as he was callous in sex, forcing unwanted babies on his wife, has come a man who wheels the pram on Saturday morning,\u201d wrote Michael Young and Peter Wilmott, egging the pudding a touch, in their study of London\u2019s Bethnal Green. Wages rose (as did inflation), hire purchase \u2013 \u201cthe never-never\u201d \u2013 arrived and ensured that \u201ca \u2018care free kitchen\u2019, was awash with products to keep \u2018the little lady\u2019 amused\u201d. Economist John Kenneth Galbraith in 1958\u2019s The Affluent Society described what we now have again, \u201cprivate affluence, public squalor\u201d. In Britain the Conservatives built houses but also created new estates that were deserts not neighbourhoods. As we lived in fear of the H-bomb and annihilation, influential child psychologist John Bowlby insisted that a good mother stayed at home with her child. However, while in 1931 10% of married women were in work, that rose sharply to 21% in 1951 and 47% in 1972. My mother became a gifted, but unqualified teacher, and I saw her at her happiest, if not without maternal guilt. \u201cIt\u2019s particularly difficult to be a woman just at present,\u201d said a character in Rosamund Lehmann\u2019s 1953 book, The Echoing Grove. \u201cOne feels so transitional and fluctuating\u2026 so I suppose do men.\u201d Money, opportunity (albeit delivered by the carnage of war) and access to education remoulded the working class \u2013 as did the advent of the teenager, the stripling baby boomer, who had plenty left over from a \u201cgood\u201d wage after handing over their keep to mam to invest in mod, teddy boy or rocker gear. The civil rights, anti-authoritarian, liberal, permissive (though not as permissive as the myths have it) attitudes that heralded the sixties were rooted in the experiences of war, the affluence of the fifties and full employment. \u201cTune in, turn on, drop out\u201d had the insurance that there was always a job waiting when flower power waned. At the beginning of the sixties too, the prewar deference \u2013 diluted in the second world war as the inequities of the class system were laid bare \u2013 translated into a cultural and intellectual acceptance of the working class. For the first time, people from my parents\u2019 backgrounds saw their working class-lives mirrored in plays, television, books and Coronation Street, watched by my mother, always the stoic, until just before her 90th birthday. Out went plots set in house parties and country estates, in came Arthur Seaton as the bicycle worker in Alan Sillitoe\u2019s Saturday Night and Sunday Morning. \u201cThe air crackled with a new energy,\u201d said Stan Barstow, author of A Kind of Loving. Nineteen-year-old Shelagh Delaney, a theatre usher, wrote a \u201ckitchen sink\u201d play, A Taste of Honey, that wonderfully tells the story of Jo, a 17-year-old working-class girl from Salford having a mixed-race \u201cbastard\u201d baby, befriended by a gay man (at a time when homosexuality was illegal). Delaney\u2019s targets were poverty, homophobia, misogyny and racism. The programme notes for the original production said of Delaney: \u201cShe is the antithesis of London\u2019s \u2018angry young men\u2019. She knows what she is angry about.\u201d In John Osborn\u2019s Look Back in Anger, Jimmy, the sweet stall holder and weekend intellectual, rages at his posh wife, Alice. She tells her father, a retired colonel: \u201cYou\u2019re hurt because everything has changed. Jimmy is hurt because everything is the same. And neither of you can face it.\u201d \u201cThe scorn which the angry young men hurled at the establishment was a class resentment but one devoid of any class consciousness,\u201d feminist Lynne Segal writes perceptively in Radical Happiness: Moments of Collective Joy. In the decades that followed, shaped by race riots, feminism, Thatcherism, the miners\u2019 strike and the collapse of heavy industry and trade unionism, working-class solidarity appeared to fracture. The rise of what\u2019s now called identity politics began. In 1961, sociologist Ferdynand Zweig noted presciently: \u201cWorking-class life finds itself on the move towards new middle-class values and middle-class existence\u2026 the change can only be described as\u2026 the development of new aspirations and cravings.\u201d My mother\u2019s ambition was to move up the social ladder when that was still possible. Today, paradoxically, middle class by education and income, I anchor myself in the working class. And I\u2019m not alone. In 2016, an Oxford University survey found that the majority of Britons called themselves working class. Nostalgia? Or a yearning for more than looking after number one? From the Blitz to Brexit is a tenuous thread but it is visible. The decades since 1939 have been conflicting and contradictory. In 1968, student and feminist Mary Ingham records in her diary: \u201cWhy am I not happy and married with two kids? Why am I aimlessly wasting away?\u201d Individualism and austerity have shifted blame from a profoundly unequal and unjust society, widely acknowledged in the war, to character failings. We have moved from criticism of the systemic to the personal. But in tribute to my parents\u2019 memory, I do believe that what existed at the heart of the people\u2019s war still continues. Namely, a hope that in collective effort, under the banner of freedom and fairness, something better can be built.",

      "body": "<p>In the spring of 1940 Winston Churchill gave three landmark parliamentary speeches, in close succession. In each he coined an array of extraordinary phrases, which almost immediately became part of the everyday language millions of people, in Britain and across the world, used to make sense of the conflict. The most powerful have, like terms coined by Shakespeare and George Orwell, become embedded in the English language.</p> <p>From Churchill\u2019s 13 May speech came the solemn prophecy of \u201c<a href=\"https://winstonchurchill.org/resources/speeches/1940-the-finest-hour/blood-toil-tears-and-sweat-2/\" title=\"\">blood, toil, tears and sweat</a>\u201d. From the speech of 4 June came the defiant call to arms, \u201c<a href=\"https://winstonchurchill.org/resources/speeches/1940-the-finest-hour/we-shall-fight-on-the-beaches/\" title=\"\">we shall fight on the beaches</a>\u201d. And two weeks week later, on 18 June, Churchill gifted the nation with the potent and galvanising concept of the \u201c<a href=\"https://winstonchurchill.org/resources/speeches/1940-the-finest-hour/their-finest-hour/\" title=\"\">finest hour</a>\u201d. Such phrases were so exquisitely judged that little beyond them survives in the national memory.</p> <p>Forgotten from the \u201cblood, toil, tears and sweat\u201d speech is the warning that without victory over Germany not only might the British nation perish but that there could be \u201cno survival for the British empire, no survival for all that the British empire has stood for\u201d. Lost from the \u201cwe shall fight on the beaches\u201d speech is Churchill\u2019s prediction that if Britain \u201cwere subjugated and starving, then our empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British fleet, would carry on the struggle\u201d. And forgotten from the \u201cfinest hour\u201d speech are the word\u2019s directly leading up to those two, magical words, \u201cif the British empire and its commonwealth last for 1,000 years, men will still say \u2018This was their finest hour\u2019\u201d.</p> <p>Churchill\u2019s references to the empire in many of his most famous speeches are small reminders of a big reality. Britain fought the second world war with men and money partly drawn from the empire and that, after the defence of the home islands, the survival of the empire was a fundamental war aim.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0042a789c1ce2ab0d297e2ef5e0da062dfb2d49b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0042a789c1ce2ab0d297e2ef5e0da062dfb2d49b/0_33_5201_3122/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jellicoe Scoon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jellicoe Scoon left Trinidad in 1942 to train as an RAF pilot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Imperial War Museums via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Before the war Churchill had been willing, in private at least, to acknowledge that the age of empire was drawing to a close. In 1937 he confided to the governor-general of India, Lord Linlithgow, that although he wanted \u201cto see the British empire persevered for a few more generations in its strength and splendour\u201d, he was aware that \u201conly the most prodigious exertions of British genius will achieve this result\u201d.</p> <p>Churchill\u2019s fear that the empire might not last even \u201ca few more generations\u201d was perhaps apparent when, in November 1942, he gave a speech at the Mansion House, as the tide of the war turned in favour of the allies. He remarked, in a statement quoted by most of his biographers, \u201cI have not become the King\u2019s first minister in order to preside over the liquidation of the British empire.\u201d The sentence that followed is quoted far less often: \u201cFor that task, if ever it were prescribed,\u201d Churchill warned, \u201csomeone else would have to be found.\u201d When the moment for liquidating the empire, or at least for bringing down the curtain on 200 years of British rule in India arrived, Churchill watched from the backbenches.</p> <p>On the night of 14 August 1947 it was the turn of Jawaharlal Nehru, independent India\u2019s first prime minister, to deliver his own immortal phrase: \u201cAt the stroke of the midnight hour,\u201d he told the Indian Constituent Assembly, \u201cwhen the world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom.\u201d That stroke of midnight arrived seven years, one month and 27 days after Churchill had beguiled parliament and the British people with the rhetorical vision of an empire that might last 1,000 years.</p> <p>During the recent centenary of the first world war it was noted by a number of historians that our understanding of that conflict has been distorted by the verses of war poets eclipsing the accounts of generals and politicians. In the case of the second world war the distorting factor is not poetry but our seemingly insatiable need to view the war through the prism of national mythology.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5e8fe4c829702de48b8d1056fd474c055bb699c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e8fe4c829702de48b8d1056fd474c055bb699c1/0_0_3000_2491/1000.jpg\" alt=\"1940 David Lowe cartoon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"830\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">This 1940 David Lowe cartoon of a lone Tommy taking on the Luftwaffe was captioned \u2018Very Well, Alone\u2019 although several empire nations declared war within hours of Britain.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pictorial Press/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The necessary myths that were created during the war, by the Ministry of Information and the press, provided the original frame, within which a thick tangle of misremembering and politicised myth-making has grown. These thickets now partly obscure the military and the political history of the conflict.</p> <p>First among them is the myth of Dunkirk, the transformation of a humiliating, costly defeat into a glorious, unlikely victory. Desperately needed to shore up morale, but pulled apart by later analysis, that vision of the \u201clittle ships\u201d and the \u201cDunkirk spirit\u201d is still celebrated, largely uncritically, seven decades later.</p> <p>Then there is the myth of the Blitz, the claim that the stoicism that was unquestionably displayed by much of the British public under aerial bombardment, was of a different order of moral magnitude to the courage displayed by German, French or Japanese civilians under similar circumstances. In addition to these myths there is the long established and unappealing habit of marginalising the war on the eastern front and the central role of the Soviet Union in defeating Hitler\u2019s armies.</p> <p>To challenge these myths is to risk being accused of hating Britain, yet for decades historians have been pushing back, offering critical analysis of the conflict that complicates simplistic narratives, introducing inconvenient facts and often unwelcome nuance. More recently scholars of the war have taken on the myth that explains why the imperial aspects of the war are so poorly remembered.</p> <p>Fundamental to the way the war is now remembered is the idea that between 1940 and 1941 Britain \u201cstood alone\u201d. The myth of national isolation is particularly potent because it is one of the central pillars of the broader fantasy of British exceptionalism, a delusion that can only be maintained by wilful historical amnesia.</p> <p>In a David Low cartoon, drawn as France was falling, and appearing in the <em>Evening Standard</em> on 18 June 1940, a British Tommy is shown standing by the coast. Rough seas hammer against the rocks and the bombers of the Luftwaffe thunder overhead. With a rifle in one hand, the Tommy raises his fist at the enemy aircraft. \u201cVery Well, Alone\u201d reads the caption.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>By 1945 Britain had been joined by 2.25 million Indians  and a third of a million Africans</p> <footer> <cite>David Olusoga</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Stirring stuff but Britain was not alone in June 1940. Indeed, over the six years of the war, Britain endured solitude for a matter of hours: on the same day Britain declared war both Australia and New Zealand issued their own declarations. Three days later South Africa entered the conflict and, the day after that, Canada.</p> <p>By 1945 Britain had been joined in supposed solitude not just by the forces of the old \u201cwhite\u201d dominions, but by 2.25 million Indian soldiers (the largest volunteer army on earth) and a third of a million African servicemen. Almost 7,000 men from the Caribbean had joined the RAF and thousands of seamen from across the empire had served in the merchant navy. The empire sent money as well as men. Canada spent $1.6bn churning out RAF pilots and navigators, and the citizens of the distant Nigerian city of Kano, on the southern fringes of the African Sahel, raised \u00a310,290. That money was sent to the British Treasury to purchase a Spitfire.</p> <p>Just as Churchill is arguably more popular in the Britain of 2019 than he was in 1945, the empire\u2019s contribution was better understood during the conflict. In 1943, the <em>Daily Express</em> complained, \u2018\u2018We frequently say that in the Battle of Britain we stood alone. But we were never just these little islands entirely by themselves. Canadian troops were among us. Australian troops were here. From all parts of the Empire aid flowed to us in men and goods.\u201d</p> <p>And another cartoon, this one from July 1940, drawn by Cyril Bird, aka Fougasse of <em>Punch Magazine</em>, depicts two British soldiers sitting by the coast. \u201cSo our poor old Empire is alone in the world,\u201d says one. \u201cAye, we are \u2013 the whole five hundred million of us,\u201d replies his comrade. What was seen then as a strength and a reason for confidence has become a forgotten detail. One that is out of step with the prevailing myth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b3c973b5ea082ec156234bd9dca70056f4df7e67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3c973b5ea082ec156234bd9dca70056f4df7e67/0_0_3233_4863/665.jpg\" alt=\"1942 poster\" width=\"665\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A 1942 poster, celebrating the spirit of cooperation across the empire, marginalises the Indian and African soldiers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PhotoQuest/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Britain went to war in 1939 in the name of freedom and democracy, but fielded armies within whose ranks were black and brown men who were regarded and often treated as second-class citizens. To manage this contradiction the government attempted to recast the British empire as a project of partnership, rather than one of domination. Yet the racial hierarchies around which the empire was ordered were apparent even in the propaganda designed to play it down. One wartime poster, created to promote the idea of imperial unity and partnership, showed servicemen from the various nations of the empire marching together in uniform, the union flag fluttering above their heads. They march as one but the divisions are stark. In the first row is a Briton, Australian and Canadian, behind them a South African and New Zealander. Tucked in the corner is a soldier from the Indian army and at the very back, squeezed into the top left corner of the poster, is an African. The two dark-skinned servicemen are literally marginalised.</p> <p>To convince Asians and Africans that victory for Britain was in their interest, concerted propaganda efforts were deployed to make them aware of the true nature of Nazism and its underlying racial theories.

      "bodyText": "In the spring of 1940 Winston Churchill gave three landmark parliamentary speeches, in close succession. In each he coined an array of extraordinary phrases, which almost immediately became part of the everyday language millions of people, in Britain and across the world, used to make sense of the conflict. The most powerful have, like terms coined by Shakespeare and George Orwell, become embedded in the English language. From Churchill\u2019s 13 May speech came the solemn prophecy of \u201cblood, toil, tears and sweat\u201d. From the speech of 4 June came the defiant call to arms, \u201cwe shall fight on the beaches\u201d. And two weeks week later, on 18 June, Churchill gifted the nation with the potent and galvanising concept of the \u201cfinest hour\u201d. Such phrases were so exquisitely judged that little beyond them survives in the national memory. Forgotten from the \u201cblood, toil, tears and sweat\u201d speech is the warning that without victory over Germany not only might the British nation perish but that there could be \u201cno survival for the British empire, no survival for all that the British empire has stood for\u201d. Lost from the \u201cwe shall fight on the beaches\u201d speech is Churchill\u2019s prediction that if Britain \u201cwere subjugated and starving, then our empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British fleet, would carry on the struggle\u201d. And forgotten from the \u201cfinest hour\u201d speech are the word\u2019s directly leading up to those two, magical words, \u201cif the British empire and its commonwealth last for 1,000 years, men will still say \u2018This was their finest hour\u2019\u201d. Churchill\u2019s references to the empire in many of his most famous speeches are small reminders of a big reality. Britain fought the second world war with men and money partly drawn from the empire and that, after the defence of the home islands, the survival of the empire was a fundamental war aim. Before the war Churchill had been willing, in private at least, to acknowledge that the age of empire was drawing to a close. In 1937 he confided to the governor-general of India, Lord Linlithgow, that although he wanted \u201cto see the British empire persevered for a few more generations in its strength and splendour\u201d, he was aware that \u201conly the most prodigious exertions of British genius will achieve this result\u201d. Churchill\u2019s fear that the empire might not last even \u201ca few more generations\u201d was perhaps apparent when, in November 1942, he gave a speech at the Mansion House, as the tide of the war turned in favour of the allies. He remarked, in a statement quoted by most of his biographers, \u201cI have not become the King\u2019s first minister in order to preside over the liquidation of the British empire.\u201d The sentence that followed is quoted far less often: \u201cFor that task, if ever it were prescribed,\u201d Churchill warned, \u201csomeone else would have to be found.\u201d When the moment for liquidating the empire, or at least for bringing down the curtain on 200 years of British rule in India arrived, Churchill watched from the backbenches. On the night of 14 August 1947 it was the turn of Jawaharlal Nehru, independent India\u2019s first prime minister, to deliver his own immortal phrase: \u201cAt the stroke of the midnight hour,\u201d he told the Indian Constituent Assembly, \u201cwhen the world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom.\u201d That stroke of midnight arrived seven years, one month and 27 days after Churchill had beguiled parliament and the British people with the rhetorical vision of an empire that might last 1,000 years. During the recent centenary of the first world war it was noted by a number of historians that our understanding of that conflict has been distorted by the verses of war poets eclipsing the accounts of generals and politicians. In the case of the second world war the distorting factor is not poetry but our seemingly insatiable need to view the war through the prism of national mythology. The necessary myths that were created during the war, by the Ministry of Information and the press, provided the original frame, within which a thick tangle of misremembering and politicised myth-making has grown. These thickets now partly obscure the military and the political history of the conflict. First among them is the myth of Dunkirk, the transformation of a humiliating, costly defeat into a glorious, unlikely victory. Desperately needed to shore up morale, but pulled apart by later analysis, that vision of the \u201clittle ships\u201d and the \u201cDunkirk spirit\u201d is still celebrated, largely uncritically, seven decades later. Then there is the myth of the Blitz, the claim that the stoicism that was unquestionably displayed by much of the British public under aerial bombardment, was of a different order of moral magnitude to the courage displayed by German, French or Japanese civilians under similar circumstances. In addition to these myths there is the long established and unappealing habit of marginalising the war on the eastern front and the central role of the Soviet Union in defeating Hitler\u2019s armies. To challenge these myths is to risk being accused of hating Britain, yet for decades historians have been pushing back, offering critical analysis of the conflict that complicates simplistic narratives, introducing inconvenient facts and often unwelcome nuance. More recently scholars of the war have taken on the myth that explains why the imperial aspects of the war are so poorly remembered. Fundamental to the way the war is now remembered is the idea that between 1940 and 1941 Britain \u201cstood alone\u201d. The myth of national isolation is particularly potent because it is one of the central pillars of the broader fantasy of British exceptionalism, a delusion that can only be maintained by wilful historical amnesia. In a David Low cartoon, drawn as France was falling, and appearing in the Evening Standard on 18 June 1940, a British Tommy is shown standing by the coast. Rough seas hammer against the rocks and the bombers of the Luftwaffe thunder overhead. With a rifle in one hand, the Tommy raises his fist at the enemy aircraft. \u201cVery Well, Alone\u201d reads the caption. Stirring stuff but Britain was not alone in June 1940. Indeed, over the six years of the war, Britain endured solitude for a matter of hours: on the same day Britain declared war both Australia and New Zealand issued their own declarations. Three days later South Africa entered the conflict and, the day after that, Canada. By 1945 Britain had been joined in supposed solitude not just by the forces of the old \u201cwhite\u201d dominions, but by 2.25 million Indian soldiers (the largest volunteer army on earth) and a third of a million African servicemen. Almost 7,000 men from the Caribbean had joined the RAF and thousands of seamen from across the empire had served in the merchant navy. The empire sent money as well as men. Canada spent $1.6bn churning out RAF pilots and navigators, and the citizens of the distant Nigerian city of Kano, on the southern fringes of the African Sahel, raised \u00a310,290. That money was sent to the British Treasury to purchase a Spitfire. Just as Churchill is arguably more popular in the Britain of 2019 than he was in 1945, the empire\u2019s contribution was better understood during the conflict. In 1943, the Daily Express complained, \u2018\u2018We frequently say that in the Battle of Britain we stood alone. But we were never just these little islands entirely by themselves. Canadian troops were among us. Australian troops were here. From all parts of the Empire aid flowed to us in men and goods.\u201d And another cartoon, this one from July 1940, drawn by Cyril Bird, aka Fougasse of Punch Magazine, depicts two British soldiers sitting by the coast. \u201cSo our poor old Empire is alone in the world,\u201d says one. \u201cAye, we are \u2013 the whole five hundred million of us,\u201d replies his comrade. What was seen then as a strength and a reason for confidence has become a forgotten detail. One that is out of step with the prevailing myth. Britain went to war in 1939 in the name of freedom and democracy, but fielded armies within whose ranks were black and brown men who were regarded and often treated as second-class citizens. To manage this contradiction the government attempted to recast the British empire as a project of partnership, rather than one of domination. Yet the racial hierarchies around which the empire was ordered were apparent even in the propaganda designed to play it down. One wartime poster, created to promote the idea of imperial unity and partnership, showed servicemen from the various nations of the empire marching together in uniform, the union flag fluttering above their heads. They march as one but the divisions are stark. In the first row is a Briton, Australian and Canadian, behind them a South African and New Zealander. Tucked in the corner is a soldier from the Indian army and at the very back, squeezed into the top left corner of the poster, is an African. The two dark-skinned servicemen are literally marginalised. To convince Asians and Africans that victory for Britain was in their interest, concerted propaganda efforts were deployed to make them aware of the true nature of Nazism and its underlying racial theories. But in August 1941 a Nigerian newspaper put its finger on the dilemma, when it asked, \u201cWhat purpose does it serve to remind us that Hitler regards us as semi-apes if the Empire for which we are ready to suffer and die \u2026 can tolerate racial discrimination against us?\u201d As a boy growing up in 1980s Britain, my friends and I were obsessed with the war and with the toy soldiers we endlessly played with. The crack unit among my own plastic legions were my 29 British Eighth Army troops. I can still remember the picture on the Airfix box they came in. Although I was taught about the war at school, watched the war films that were endlessly repeated on TV and borrowed books about the war from the library, nothing I learned or read led me to suspect for a moment that any of the soldiers of the Eighth Army were anything other than white and British. The Eighth Army, the force shipped to north Africa to defend a key supply route \u2013 the Suez canal \u2013 from the Italians and the German Afrika Korps, was, in fact, one of the most diverse armies ever assembled. By 1941, the year of the siege of Tobruk, only a quarter of the troops of the British Eighth Army were British. As the historian Ashley Jackson has pointed out, the rest came from India, Sri Lanka, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Southern Rhodesia, Uganda, Tanganyika, the Gold Coast, Kenya, Nigeria, Bechuanaland, the Gambia, Sierra Leone, Swaziland, Palestine, Mauritius, the Seychelles and Cyprus. Why did the picture on my box of Airfix soldiers not reflect the reality of the imperial, multiracial, multi-faith, polyglot army? Why were they all depicted as white, and what lessons about the war might my schoolfriends and I have learnt had they not been?",

Some became permanent estates, including one in Wythenshawe in south Manchester, with its brightly painted modular metal houses. </p> <p><strong>Templewood School, Welwyn Garden City, 1950</strong><br>Mass-producing new schools was a speciality of Hertfordshire county council. Templewood is one of the best, a lightweight structure in a miniature wood, with a mural of Russian folk tales inside, a remnant from when the Soviets were our allies. The architect, A Cleeve-Barr, was a communist.</p> <p><strong>Memorial Gardens, Walsall, 1952</strong><br>On a hill above the Black Country town, this is one of the subtlest of war memorials \u2013 a formal garden, which opens out to an axial circus of council houses, coordinated as part of the same project by the architect Geoffrey Jellicoe; the sacrifice and the reward.</p> <p><strong>Coventry Cathedral, 1962</strong><br>The centrepiece of what was once a globally praised exemplar of postwar reconstruction, Coventry Cathedral, built around the ruins of the medieval cathedral destroyed in 1940, is both a war memorial of astonishing forgiveness and generosity, and an unrivalled showcase of mid-century British art, with its Graham Sutherland tapestry, John Piper stained glass and Jacob Epstein sculptures.</p> <p><strong>Bomber Command memorial, London, 2012</strong><br>Various new war memorials were built in the 2000s, all of them with a sentimentality and aesthetic conservatism that clearly wasn\u2019t shared by the wartime generation. One in Green Park, generously funded by Lord Ashcroft \u2013 as it tells you in big letters \u2013 is in a class of its own of retrograde imperial kitsch; ironically, just the sort of badly scaled neoclassicism that Hitler so fervently admired. It won the award given out by the late Gavin Stamp, <em>Private Eye</em>\u2019s \u201cPiloti\u201d, for worst new building in 2012. <em><br><br></em></p> <h2>Broadcast, by Observer arts and media correspondent<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/vanessathorpe\"> Vanessa Thorpe</a><br></h2> <p>Although television services were shut down for the duration, lessons learned from wartime radio still shape output today.

A group of bomber pilots and their wives are followed over a weekend: in detail, tenderly, with a keen eye for fraudulence and a sharp ear for slang. Tickety boo.</p> <p><strong>Operation Mincemeat, SpitLip, 2019<br></strong>This spring the new company Spitlip staged a gloriously inventive response to the second world war. Inspired by a singularly preposterous intelligence operation, they created a frisky high-speed musical with a finely varied score and some of the most inventive lyrics of the last 20 years.</p> <p><strong>The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui, Bertolt Brecht, 1941<br></strong>The \u201cparable\u201d plots the career of an imaginary Chicago mobster, who deal in cauliflowers. An allegory of the rise to power of Hitler and the Nazi party, the play embodied some new directions for the theatre: less drawing-room, more political forum; a busting out of the proscenium arch.</p> <p><strong>Bent, Martin Sherman, 1979<br></strong>A revelatory study of the Nazis\u2019 treatment of homosexuals follows a gay man from hedonism in Weimar to hell in Dachau. The play has been performed in more than 60 countries \u2013 and filmed in 1997, with Mick Jagger appearing as a drag queen.</p> <p><strong>South Pacific, Rodgers and Hammerstein, 1949<br></strong>The Broadway hit features an American nurse stationed on a South Pacific island. Some of the action (such as the courtship of a young Tonkinese girl by a much older serviceman) looks queasy now. But the songs \u2013 which include Some Enchanted Evening \u2013 linger on.</p> <p><strong>Kindertransport, Diane Samuels, 1993<br></strong>Samuels drew on the historical experiences of Kindertransport children to imagine the life of a Jewish girl sent from Nazi Germany to be fostered in Manchester. Her study of displacement has since been performed in Japan, Sweden, Germany, Austria, Canada and South Africa.</p> <p><strong>Copenhagen, Michael Frayn, 1998<br></strong>Set in the occupied Danish capital in 1941, Frayn\u2019s play features human uncertainty and the atomic physics of the period, rewinding its scenes as if to cast doubt on its subject. Michael Blakemore\u2019s crystalline production ushered in a new era of science plays.</p> <p><strong>Soldiers, Rolf Hochhuth, 1967<br></strong>The play, that found fervent advocates in Kenneth Tynan \u2013 and David Irving, debated the saturation bombing of German cities and alleged that Churchill was involved in the murder of the Polish prime minister General Sikorski. Hochhuth was successfully sued for libel by a Polish pilot.</p> <p><strong>Cabaret, Kander and Ebb, 1966<br></strong>Based on Christopher Isherwood\u2019s novel Goodbye to Berlin, and set in the glitzy grime of the Kit Kat Club, the musical charted the rise of Nazism and at different times starred Judi Dench and Jane Horrocks as Sally Bowles.</p> <p><strong>An Inspector Calls, JB Priestley, 1945<br></strong>This drawing-room thriller was first staged in the former Soviet Union. In 1992 a ground-breaking (and design-cracking) production by Stephen Daldry, suggested it should be seen not only as reflecting the post-war move to Labour but as prophesying Thatcherism. <em>Chosen by Susannah Clapp</em></p> <h2>Fashion, by historian<a href=\"https://www.amberbutchart.com/\"> Amber Butchart</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f8c301f7cd9809919ea3a7f867372a497c1137f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8c301f7cd9809919ea3a7f867372a497c1137f0/0_307_3613_2168/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Make do and mend 1943\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">War workers in London at a make do and mend centre in 1943.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Trinity Mirror/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cKeep up the morale of the Home Front by preserving a neat appearance,\u201d ran a 1940 Board of Trade slogan in 1940, a reminder that the war infiltrated every aspect of daily life, and that fashion and beauty were part of the battleground. Many trends that proliferate today can be traced back to the 1940s, from workwear to vintage, though personal maintenance is no longer a national duty</p> <p><strong>Britain as a fashion capital</strong><br>The Incorporated Society of London Fashion Designers (IncSoc) was established in 1942. It promoted British style and established London as a fashion centre. IncSoc designed luxury export garments to raise money for the war effort and, with the couturier scheme, also created clothing for mass manufacture in what we would now call a high street/high fashion collaboration.</p> <p><strong>Workwear</strong><br>The current trend for boilersuits and jumpsuits owes much to the siren suit \u2013 an all-in-one (often with hood) that was functional yet stylish and developed to be worn during an air raid. Even Churchill wore them.</p> <p><strong>Vintage</strong><br>Secondhand clothing was not rationed, so the rag trade thrived. Not yet called \u201cvintage\u201d, pre-owned clothes helped people negotiate wartime restrictions (in place from 1941 to 1949). This is where the slogan \u201cMake Do and Mend\u201d came from, a phrase firmly back in fashion today.</p> <p><strong>Slogan clothing</strong><br>Mayfair-based company Jacqmar created silk scarves emblazoned with propaganda prints, ranging from \u201cSalvage your rubber\u201d to \u201cFree French\u201d (a reference to General de Gaulle\u2019s rallying speech and the Free French army).</p> <p><strong>Grooming</strong><br>\u201cMake up is cherished, a last desperately defended luxury,\u201d wrote <em>Vogue</em> in 1942.

The war had a long-lasting and, arguably, devastating impact on British food. Restaurants and hotels stopped training chefs, the variety of food was severely limited and, for good reason, quantity was prioritised over quality. The population became so fed up with the situation that one of the contributing factors for Labour losing the 1951 election was people\u2019s frustration with continuing food shortages. Overall the war transformed food production and had a huge impact on the nation\u2019s diet, changing tastes and attitudes as well as introducing a number of new foods still familiar today.</p> <p><strong>Spam</strong><br>From the Boer war to the first world war \u201cbully\u201d beef was the meat enjoyed or, more likely, endured by soldiers. But during the second world war another tinned meat took centre stage. Invented in Minnesota in 1937 by Jay C Hormel, Spam was easy to transport, long-lasting and cheap. Introduced to Britain in 1941, it was widely adopted by the forces and civilians alike. By the 1950s Spam fritters and Spam, eggs and chips had become British staples.</p> <p><strong>Coca-Cola </strong><br>American soldiers were paid more than five times as much. They arrived in the UK with chewing gum, stockings, cash and the ultimate sign of American culture, Coca-Cola. When America joined the war in 1941, company president Robert Woodruff ordered that \u201cevery man in uniform gets a bottle of Coca-Cola for five cents, wherever he is\u2026\u201d By the end of the war, Britain had gained a taste for coke \u2013 and the glamour it symbolised. </p> <p><strong>Instant coffee</strong> <br>In 1901 a Japanese chemist in Chicago invented instant coffee and first world war American military personnel were downing on average 36lb of the stuff a year. US soldiers stationed in the UK introduced tea-drinking Brits to instant coffee during the second world war. By the end of the 1940s tea was still the national drink but instant coffee was coming up on the inside.</p> <p><strong>Margarine</strong><br>Margarine was invented in 1869 thanks to a competition set by French emperor Napoleon III to invent a butter replacement. It was seen as a solution to food shortages. It was cheap to produce and longer lasting than butter \u2013 the ultimate industrial food product. During the war it was included in rations and so became a kitchen staple. Despite its widespread adoption, however, it was always associated with poverty and culinary compromise. Only in the 1970s and 1980s, with dubious health claims made about its benefits for weight loss, did its reputation rise.</p> <p><strong>Cheese</strong> <br>The story of the war and cheese is one of regional culinary traditions being all but destroyed. In the first decade of the 20th century the UK had more than 3,500 farmhouse cheese-makers. By the end of the second world war there were around 100. The Ministry of Food policy during the war stipulated that only one type of cheese could be made \u2013 by all accounts a bland cheddar mass produced in factories. For decades decent cheese in the UK was all but limited to French imports but in the 1990s, thanks to collapsing milk prices, a new generation of dairy farmers revived regional cheese production.</p> <h2>Science, by Observer science editor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/robinmckie\">Robin McKie</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"737cf06bd89b5fa62e75b29cf834fb96951c5097\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/737cf06bd89b5fa62e75b29cf834fb96951c5097/0_19_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Colossus\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Colossus was the world\u2019s first electronic programmable computer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bletchley Park Trust/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Winston Churchill was a keen reader of scientific works, including books by Darwin and HG Wells. He liaised closely with scientists as wartime leader \u2013 mainly through his contact with Frederick Lindermann, his chief scientific adviser. Churchill was also fervently pro-American and constantly tried to get US industry to support British scientific ideas, a task that became much easier after Pearl Harbor.</p> <p><strong>Radio astronomy</strong><br>The first practical radar system was produced in 1935 by the British physicist Sir Robert Watson-Watt. By 1939 the UK had established a chain of radar stations along its coasts to detect incoming bomber planes. The system played a key role in the Battle of Britain. Two scientists, Tony Hewish and Martin Ryle, both worked on developing radar and used the technology to pioneer the field of radio astronomy, opening up a new way to investigate the heavens. </p> <p><strong>Penicillin</strong><br>The world\u2019s first antibiotic was discovered by British researcher Alexander Fleming in 1928. Attempts to mass produce penicillin failed until the outbreak of war when efforts began in earnest. Patients were first treated with the drug in 1942. By the end of the war more than 600 billion units were manufactured each year. The pharmaceutical industry remains one of Britain\u2019s key revenue earners.</p> <p><strong>Nuclear power</strong><br>In 1940 scientists Rudolf Peierls and Otto Frisch at Birmingham University realised a critical mass of uranium-235 would explode with the power of thousands of tons of dynamite, prompting Britain to create an atomic bomb project, known as Tube Alloys. After the US entered the war, the UK decided to shelve this and participate in the American programme, the Manhattan project. After the war, Britain established the world\u2019s first civil nuclear programme. The UK now has 15 reactors generating about 21% of its electricity, although almost half of this capacity is to be retired by 2025.</p> <p><strong>Computers</strong><br>British codebreakers deciphered many of Germany\u2019s messages from the start of the second world war. However, this work was boosted by the development in 1943 of Colossus, the world\u2019s first programmable, electronic, digital computer. These machines \u2013 installed at Bletchley Park in Milton Keynes \u2013 played a crucial role in unravelling the plans of German generals after the Allied landings in Normandy in June 1944. All information on the Colossus was kept classified and the machines were destroyed. It was only relatively recently that the scientists involved have been mentioned publicly. This secrecy proved a key factor in Britain\u2019s failure to develop computers commercially.</p> <h2>Music, by Observer critic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/fiona-maddocks\">Fiona Maddocks</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"59007ea78c1ec8fd0793ae72673293b69e8aea3f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59007ea78c1ec8fd0793ae72673293b69e8aea3f/0_0_2704_1622/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Olivier Messiaen wrote Quatuor pour la fin du temps while he was a prisoner of war in Stalag VIII-A.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Olivier Messiaen wrote Quatuor pour la fin du temps while he was a prisoner of war in Stalag VIII-A.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sipa Press / Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Michael Tippett (UK), A Child of Our Time, 1939-41<br></strong>Begun on 4 September 1939, the day after the declaration of war, Tippett wrote this grand choral work initially as a reaction to the violence of Kristallnacht in 1938, when German Nazis attacked Jewish people and their properties. It was premiered at the Adelphi Theatre, London on 19 March 1944.</p> <p><strong>Olivier Messiaen (France), Quatuor pour la fin du temps, 1940<br></strong>Messiaen wrote his Quartet for the End of Time while held prisoner in a German war camp, Stalag VIII-A. For piano, cello, clarinet and violin, it was first performed by the composer and fellow prisoners, outdoors in the cold to guards and inmates, on 15 January 1941.</p> <p><strong>Dmitri Shostakovich (Russia), Leningrad Symphony, 1941<br></strong>Shostakovich\u2019s epic was officially written in response to Germany\u2019s invasion of Russia but he said the symphony \u201cis not about Leningrad under siege. It\u2019s about the Leningrad that Stalin destroyed and that Hitler merely finished off.\u201d Played by a depleted orchestra of sick and starving musicians, it was performed in Leningrad in August 1942 when the city was still under siege.</p> <p><strong>Aaron Copland (USA), Fanfare for the Common Man, 1942<br></strong>Inspired by President Henry A Wallace\u2019s 1942 speech heralding the \u201ccentury of the common man\u201d, Copland composed the Fanfare as a response to American entering World War Two. He and other composers were commissioned to write stirring fanfares in honour of servicemen and women, as a contribution to the war effort.</p> <p><strong>Richard Strauss (Germany), Metamorphosen, 1945<br></strong>Composed in the final months of war, Richard Strauss\u2019s elegy for 23 solo strings is thought - the composer did not specify - to commemorate the bombing of the three cities he most loved, Munich, Dresden and Berlin, and specifically the destruction of their opera houses, where so many of his own works had been premiered.</p> <p><strong>Maurice Durufl\u00e9 (France), Requiem, 1941-47<br></strong>During the pro-Nazi Vichy government (1940-44), artists benefited from official commissions, part of a propaganda programme to highlight French culture. Durufle accepted one in 1941, eventually submitting the invoice in 1948. He was a slow worker, but may also have felt compromised by the political stigma of Vichy. The much-loved Requiem became a mainstay of Armistice Day services in France.</p> <p><strong>Zoltan Kodaly (Hungary), Missa Brevis, 1945<br></strong>Subtitled \u201ctempore belli\u201d (time of war), this work for organ and mixed choir was born of difficult times: in the siege of Budapest in the winter of 1944/45, Kod\u00e1ly had to take refuge in the cellars of the Budapest Opera House. The first performance, in February 1945 with gunfire in the street, was given in a cloakroom in the Opera House. It\u2019s official premiere was at the Three Choirs Festival, Worcester, in 1948.</p> <p><strong>Erich Korngold (Austria), Violin Concerto, 1945<br></strong>The Viennese-born Korngold, a prominent composer in the golden age of Hollywood, left Europe in 1934 with the rise of the Nazi regime, abandoning concert work in favour of film scores. He maintained he would not return to writing concert music until Hitler was defeated. This lush, lyrical concerto in effect marked that event.</p> <p><strong>Arnold Schoenberg (Austria-US), A Survivor from Warsaw, 1947<br></strong>By now an emigre living in Los Angeles, and close to the end of his life, Schoenberg wrote A Survivor from Warsaw, for narrator, men\u2019s chorus and orchestra, as a commemoration of Holocaust victims. It tells the story, faithful more in psychology and spirit than in factual accuracy, of a survivor from the Warsaw ghetto.</p> <p><strong>Benjamin Britten (UK), War Requiem, 1962<br></strong>Britten\u2019s Requiem mass setting, interspersed with war poems by Wilfred Owen, was written for the opening of the new Coventry Cathedral, after bombing destroyed the original 14th-century structure. Britten intended the premiere to include a German and Russian soloist.

      "bodyText": "Architecture, by Tribune culture editor Owen Hatherley The second world war had seismic effects on architecture, with reconstruction aimed not just at repairing war damage, but at creating a new society that would never let anything like fascism and world war happen again. As we get more distant from the events and actual memory, the war is increasingly remembered in terms of nostalgic kitsch Royal Victoria Hospital Tearooms, Southampton, 1940 This wooden tearoom was built for the massive increase in staff and patients the war brought. As a small reminder that Britain didn\u2019t exactly \u201cstand alone\u201d in 1940, the timber for the building came from 100 different locations across the global empire. Tin Town, Manchester, 1946 Many wartime factories were converted to build emergency prefabricated houses for those made homeless in the bombing. Some became permanent estates, including one in Wythenshawe in south Manchester, with its brightly painted modular metal houses. Templewood School, Welwyn Garden City, 1950 Mass-producing new schools was a speciality of Hertfordshire county council. Templewood is one of the best, a lightweight structure in a miniature wood, with a mural of Russian folk tales inside, a remnant from when the Soviets were our allies. The architect, A Cleeve-Barr, was a communist. Memorial Gardens, Walsall, 1952 On a hill above the Black Country town, this is one of the subtlest of war memorials \u2013 a formal garden, which opens out to an axial circus of council houses, coordinated as part of the same project by the architect Geoffrey Jellicoe; the sacrifice and the reward. Coventry Cathedral, 1962 The centrepiece of what was once a globally praised exemplar of postwar reconstruction, Coventry Cathedral, built around the ruins of the medieval cathedral destroyed in 1940, is both a war memorial of astonishing forgiveness and generosity, and an unrivalled showcase of mid-century British art, with its Graham Sutherland tapestry, John Piper stained glass and Jacob Epstein sculptures. Bomber Command memorial, London, 2012 Various new war memorials were built in the 2000s, all of them with a sentimentality and aesthetic conservatism that clearly wasn\u2019t shared by the wartime generation. One in Green Park, generously funded by Lord Ashcroft \u2013 as it tells you in big letters \u2013 is in a class of its own of retrograde imperial kitsch; ironically, just the sort of badly scaled neoclassicism that Hitler so fervently admired. It won the award given out by the late Gavin Stamp, Private Eye\u2019s \u201cPiloti\u201d, for worst new building in 2012. Broadcast, by Observer arts and media correspondent Vanessa Thorpe Although television services were shut down for the duration, lessons learned from wartime radio still shape output today. The BBC was the power in the land and by 1944 George Orwell, a former BBC propagandist, noted that the phrase \u201cI heard it on the BBC\u201d had come to mean \u201cI know it must be true\u201d. Radio Hamburg\u2019s \u2018Lord Haw-Haw\u2019, 1939 to 1945 Enemy propaganda broadcasts in English from Anglo-Irish defector William Joyce were heard by 6 million listeners, as were those of his Japanese female equivalents, known collectively as Tokyo Rose. These dripping taps of \u201cfake news\u201d attempted to deflate Allied morale. Charles de Gaulle\u2019s \u2018Appeal of 18 June\u2019 1940 The exiled French general\u2019s appeal to Free French forces, transmitted from London\u2019s Broadcasting House, is thought to be the origin of the French resistance movement. The influence of his speeches cemented the future role of the foreign language output of the BBC World Service as an unofficial diplomatic boon. Wynford Vaughan-Thomas\u2019s live report from a bombing raid on Berlin, 1943 Four years into the war the RAF offered the BBC the chance to send a radio crew on a bombing raid. On 3 September Vaughan-Thomas took to the sky in a Lancaster bomber headed for Berlin. His live account opened up the idea of broadcasts that were not just a sombre list of military positions and casualties. Holocaust: 1979, US TV series Twenty million people, a third of West Germany\u2019s population, watched at least part of this series starring Meryl Streep when it was shown on WDR and 86% of its German audience went on to discuss the issues with friends or family. Many who telephoned the broadcaster afterwards to express their shock were in tears. Dad\u2019s Army, by Jimmy Perry and David Croft, broadcast on the BBC from 1968 to 1977 Half-affectionate and half-parodic, this sitcom about a chaotic Home Guard troop of volunteers serving in Sussex, under imminent threat of German invasion, has proved one of the most enduring narratives of wartime life. It\u2019s still so popular that lost episodes are being reshot with a new cast. Theatre, by Observer critic Susannah Clapp Flare Path, Terence Rattigan, 1941 Written while Rattigan was serving in the RAF: he salvaged a draft of the script when jettisoning stuff from a damaged Sunderland. A group of bomber pilots and their wives are followed over a weekend: in detail, tenderly, with a keen eye for fraudulence and a sharp ear for slang. Tickety boo. Operation Mincemeat, SpitLip, 2019 This spring the new company Spitlip staged a gloriously inventive response to the second world war. Inspired by a singularly preposterous intelligence operation, they created a frisky high-speed musical with a finely varied score and some of the most inventive lyrics of the last 20 years. The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui, Bertolt Brecht, 1941 The \u201cparable\u201d plots the career of an imaginary Chicago mobster, who deal in cauliflowers. An allegory of the rise to power of Hitler and the Nazi party, the play embodied some new directions for the theatre: less drawing-room, more political forum; a busting out of the proscenium arch. Bent, Martin Sherman, 1979 A revelatory study of the Nazis\u2019 treatment of homosexuals follows a gay man from hedonism in Weimar to hell in Dachau. The play has been performed in more than 60 countries \u2013 and filmed in 1997, with Mick Jagger appearing as a drag queen. South Pacific, Rodgers and Hammerstein, 1949 The Broadway hit features an American nurse stationed on a South Pacific island. Some of the action (such as the courtship of a young Tonkinese girl by a much older serviceman) looks queasy now. But the songs \u2013 which include Some Enchanted Evening \u2013 linger on. Kindertransport, Diane Samuels, 1993 Samuels drew on the historical experiences of Kindertransport children to imagine the life of a Jewish girl sent from Nazi Germany to be fostered in Manchester. Her study of displacement has since been performed in Japan, Sweden, Germany, Austria, Canada and South Africa. Copenhagen, Michael Frayn, 1998 Set in the occupied Danish capital in 1941, Frayn\u2019s play features human uncertainty and the atomic physics of the period, rewinding its scenes as if to cast doubt on its subject. Michael Blakemore\u2019s crystalline production ushered in a new era of science plays. Soldiers, Rolf Hochhuth, 1967 The play, that found fervent advocates in Kenneth Tynan \u2013 and David Irving, debated the saturation bombing of German cities and alleged that Churchill was involved in the murder of the Polish prime minister General Sikorski. Hochhuth was successfully sued for libel by a Polish pilot. Cabaret, Kander and Ebb, 1966 Based on Christopher Isherwood\u2019s novel Goodbye to Berlin, and set in the glitzy grime of the Kit Kat Club, the musical charted the rise of Nazism and at different times starred Judi Dench and Jane Horrocks as Sally Bowles. An Inspector Calls, JB Priestley, 1945 This drawing-room thriller was first staged in the former Soviet Union. In 1992 a ground-breaking (and design-cracking) production by Stephen Daldry, suggested it should be seen not only as reflecting the post-war move to Labour but as prophesying Thatcherism. Chosen by Susannah Clapp Fashion, by historian Amber Butchart \u201cKeep up the morale of the Home Front by preserving a neat appearance,\u201d ran a 1940 Board of Trade slogan in 1940, a reminder that the war infiltrated every aspect of daily life, and that fashion and beauty were part of the battleground. Many trends that proliferate today can be traced back to the 1940s, from workwear to vintage, though personal maintenance is no longer a national duty Britain as a fashion capital The Incorporated Society of London Fashion Designers (IncSoc) was established in 1942. It promoted British style and established London as a fashion centre. IncSoc designed luxury export garments to raise money for the war effort and, with the couturier scheme, also created clothing for mass manufacture in what we would now call a high street/high fashion collaboration. Workwear The current trend for boilersuits and jumpsuits owes much to the siren suit \u2013 an all-in-one (often with hood) that was functional yet stylish and developed to be worn during an air raid. Even Churchill wore them. Vintage Secondhand clothing was not rationed, so the rag trade thrived. Not yet called \u201cvintage\u201d, pre-owned clothes helped people negotiate wartime restrictions (in place from 1941 to 1949). This is where the slogan \u201cMake Do and Mend\u201d came from, a phrase firmly back in fashion today. Slogan clothing Mayfair-based company Jacqmar created silk scarves emblazoned with propaganda prints, ranging from \u201cSalvage your rubber\u201d to \u201cFree French\u201d (a reference to General de Gaulle\u2019s rallying speech and the Free French army). Grooming \u201cMake up is cherished, a last desperately defended luxury,\u201d wrote Vogue in 1942. Beauty became part of the call to arms as women were encouraged to keep morale high on the home front through a neat appearance. Helena Rubinstein created a lipstick shade called Regimental Red. Food, by historian Polly Russell Despite nostalgic rhetoric that suggests Britons merrily coped with 14 years of rationing, the reality was grim. The war had a long-lasting and, arguably, devastating impact on British food. Restaurants and hotels stopped training chefs, the variety of food was severely limited and, for good reason, quantity was prioritised over quality. The population became so fed up with the situation that one of the contributing factors for Labour losing the 1951 election was people\u2019s frustration with continuing food shortages. Overall the war transformed food production and had a huge impact on the nation\u2019s diet, changing tastes and attitudes as well as introducing a number of new foods still familiar today. Spam From the Boer war to the first world war \u201cbully\u201d beef was the meat enjoyed or, more likely, endured by soldiers. But during the second world war another tinned meat took centre stage. Invented in Minnesota in 1937 by Jay C Hormel, Spam was easy to transport, long-lasting and cheap. Introduced to Britain in 1941, it was widely adopted by the forces and civilians alike. By the 1950s Spam fritters and Spam, eggs and chips had become British staples. Coca-Cola American soldiers were paid more than five times as much. They arrived in the UK with chewing gum, stockings, cash and the ultimate sign of American culture, Coca-Cola. When America joined the war in 1941, company president Robert Woodruff ordered that \u201cevery man in uniform gets a bottle of Coca-Cola for five cents, wherever he is\u2026\u201d By the end of the war, Britain had gained a taste for coke \u2013 and the glamour it symbolised. Instant coffee In 1901 a Japanese chemist in Chicago invented instant coffee and first world war American military personnel were downing on average 36lb of the stuff a year. US soldiers stationed in the UK introduced tea-drinking Brits to instant coffee during the second world war. By the end of the 1940s tea was still the national drink but instant coffee was coming up on the inside. Margarine Margarine was invented in 1869 thanks to a competition set by French emperor Napoleon III to invent a butter replacement. It was seen as a solution to food shortages. It was cheap to produce and longer lasting than butter \u2013 the ultimate industrial food product. During the war it was included in rations and so became a kitchen staple. Despite its widespread adoption, however, it was always associated with poverty and culinary compromise. Only in the 1970s and 1980s, with dubious health claims made about its benefits for weight loss, did its reputation rise. Cheese The story of the war and cheese is one of regional culinary traditions being all but destroyed. In the first decade of the 20th century the UK had more than 3,500 farmhouse cheese-makers. By the end of the second world war there were around 100. The Ministry of Food policy during the war stipulated that only one type of cheese could be made \u2013 by all accounts a bland cheddar mass produced in factories. For decades decent cheese in the UK was all but limited to French imports but in the 1990s, thanks to collapsing milk prices, a new generation of dairy farmers revived regional cheese production. Science, by Observer science editor Robin McKie Winston Churchill was a keen reader of scientific works, including books by Darwin and HG Wells. He liaised closely with scientists as wartime leader \u2013 mainly through his contact with Frederick Lindermann, his chief scientific adviser. Churchill was also fervently pro-American and constantly tried to get US industry to support British scientific ideas, a task that became much easier after Pearl Harbor. Radio astronomy The first practical radar system was produced in 1935 by the British physicist Sir Robert Watson-Watt. By 1939 the UK had established a chain of radar stations along its coasts to detect incoming bomber planes. The system played a key role in the Battle of Britain. Two scientists, Tony Hewish and Martin Ryle, both worked on developing radar and used the technology to pioneer the field of radio astronomy, opening up a new way to investigate the heavens. Penicillin The world\u2019s first antibiotic was discovered by British researcher Alexander Fleming in 1928. Attempts to mass produce penicillin failed until the outbreak of war when efforts began in earnest. Patients were first treated with the drug in 1942. By the end of the war more than 600 billion units were manufactured each year. The pharmaceutical industry remains one of Britain\u2019s key revenue earners. Nuclear power In 1940 scientists Rudolf Peierls and Otto Frisch at Birmingham University realised a critical mass of uranium-235 would explode with the power of thousands of tons of dynamite, prompting Britain to create an atomic bomb project, known as Tube Alloys. After the US entered the war, the UK decided to shelve this and participate in the American programme, the Manhattan project. After the war, Britain established the world\u2019s first civil nuclear programme. The UK now has 15 reactors generating about 21% of its electricity, although almost half of this capacity is to be retired by 2025. Computers British codebreakers deciphered many of Germany\u2019s messages from the start of the second world war. However, this work was boosted by the development in 1943 of Colossus, the world\u2019s first programmable, electronic, digital computer. These machines \u2013 installed at Bletchley Park in Milton Keynes \u2013 played a crucial role in unravelling the plans of German generals after the Allied landings in Normandy in June 1944. All information on the Colossus was kept classified and the machines were destroyed. It was only relatively recently that the scientists involved have been mentioned publicly. This secrecy proved a key factor in Britain\u2019s failure to develop computers commercially. Music, by Observer critic Fiona Maddocks Michael Tippett (UK), A Child of Our Time, 1939-41 Begun on 4 September 1939, the day after the declaration of war, Tippett wrote this grand choral work initially as a reaction to the violence of Kristallnacht in 1938, when German Nazis attacked Jewish people and their properties. It was premiered at the Adelphi Theatre, London on 19 March 1944. Olivier Messiaen (France), Quatuor pour la fin du temps, 1940 Messiaen wrote his Quartet for the End of Time while held prisoner in a German war camp, Stalag VIII-A. For piano, cello, clarinet and violin, it was first performed by the composer and fellow prisoners, outdoors in the cold to guards and inmates, on 15 January 1941. Dmitri Shostakovich (Russia), Leningrad Symphony, 1941 Shostakovich\u2019s epic was officially written in response to Germany\u2019s invasion of Russia but he said the symphony \u201cis not about Leningrad under siege. It\u2019s about the Leningrad that Stalin destroyed and that Hitler merely finished off.\u201d Played by a depleted orchestra of sick and starving musicians, it was performed in Leningrad in August 1942 when the city was still under siege. Aaron Copland (USA), Fanfare for the Common Man, 1942 Inspired by President Henry A Wallace\u2019s 1942 speech heralding the \u201ccentury of the common man\u201d, Copland composed the Fanfare as a response to American entering World War Two. He and other composers were commissioned to write stirring fanfares in honour of servicemen and women, as a contribution to the war effort. Richard Strauss (Germany), Metamorphosen, 1945 Composed in the final months of war, Richard Strauss\u2019s elegy for 23 solo strings is thought - the composer did not specify - to commemorate the bombing of the three cities he most loved, Munich, Dresden and Berlin, and specifically the destruction of their opera houses, where so many of his own works had been premiered. Maurice Durufl\u00e9 (France), Requiem, 1941-47 During the pro-Nazi Vichy government (1940-44), artists benefited from official commissions, part of a propaganda programme to highlight French culture. Durufle accepted one in 1941, eventually submitting the invoice in 1948. He was a slow worker, but may also have felt compromised by the political stigma of Vichy. The much-loved Requiem became a mainstay of Armistice Day services in France. Zoltan Kodaly (Hungary), Missa Brevis, 1945 Subtitled \u201ctempore belli\u201d (time of war), this work for organ and mixed choir was born of difficult times: in the siege of Budapest in the winter of 1944/45, Kod\u00e1ly had to take refuge in the cellars of the Budapest Opera House. The first performance, in February 1945 with gunfire in the street, was given in a cloakroom in the Opera House. It\u2019s official premiere was at the Three Choirs Festival, Worcester, in 1948. Erich Korngold (Austria), Violin Concerto, 1945 The Viennese-born Korngold, a prominent composer in the golden age of Hollywood, left Europe in 1934 with the rise of the Nazi regime, abandoning concert work in favour of film scores. He maintained he would not return to writing concert music until Hitler was defeated. This lush, lyrical concerto in effect marked that event. Arnold Schoenberg (Austria-US), A Survivor from Warsaw, 1947 By now an emigre living in Los Angeles, and close to the end of his life, Schoenberg wrote A Survivor from Warsaw, for narrator, men\u2019s chorus and orchestra, as a commemoration of Holocaust victims. It tells the story, faithful more in psychology and spirit than in factual accuracy, of a survivor from the Warsaw ghetto. Benjamin Britten (UK), War Requiem, 1962 Britten\u2019s Requiem mass setting, interspersed with war poems by Wilfred Owen, was written for the opening of the new Coventry Cathedral, after bombing destroyed the original 14th-century structure. Britten intended the premiere to include a German and Russian soloist. The Soviets would not comply, but the War Requiem is valued worldwide as a work of European reconciliation. Chosen by Fiona Maddocks Dates are period of composition, not of premieres Film, by Observer critic Wendy Ide Army of Shadows, 1969 Jean-Pierre Melville, a former member of the French Resistance, brings his muscular approach to this superb portrait of the ordinary men and women who fought covertly against the Nazi occupation. No empty heroics here, just a bone deep melancholy and impossible choices. Saving Private Ryan, 1998 There is arguably no greater piece of combat cinema than the first 24 minutes of Steven Spielberg\u2019s drama. The audience is plunged into the visceral terror Normandy landings through hand-held camera and immersive sound design. Come And See, 1985 Set in Belarus in 1943, this child\u2019s eye view of the evils of the occupying Nazis is a portrait of innocence destroyed but spirit unbroken. A devastatingly powerful indictment of war. Son of Saul, 2015 The daring drama set in a concentration camp follows an inmate\u2019s desperate quest to secure a Jewish burial for his dead child. The immersive approach is tough going, but breathlessly tense. Downfall, 2004 The film that spawned a thousand Hitler memes is an uncompromising, superbly acted account of the final days of the Third Reich. Claustrophobic and unflinching in its gaze, the film forces the acknowledgement that it was ordinary people rather than monsters who perpetrated Nazi war crimes. Bridge On the River Kwai, 1957 David Lean\u2019s stirring drama, set in a Japanese internment camp, explores the complexities of war and of the characters of the men caught in the cross hairs. Alec Guinness plays the British colonel who turns forced labour into a morale building exercise for his men. Grave of the Fireflies, 1988 This achingly sad animation from Studio Ghibli follows two Japanese children struggling to survive at the tail end of the war. Strikingly beautiful and profoundly affecting, it\u2019s a landmark both in animation and in war film. Schindler\u2019s List, 1993 Liam Neeson plays the opportunistic industrialist who gradually awakens to the plight of his Jewish work force. Steven Spielberg\u2019s humanist approach to the horror of the holocaust, and the themes of redemption and courage, make this one of the more accessible second world war movies. Casablanca, 1942 Romance set against the backdrop of war has rarely been as photogenic as it is in this classic picture which captures the restless tension of being displaced by war, the sense of normal life somehow suspended. Shoah, 1985 It\u2019s more than nine hours in length, But there\u2019s not a minute in Claude Lanzmann\u2019s monumental documentary which isn\u2019t essential. This haunting film is perhaps the most important account of the war ever made. Children\u2019s books, by critic Fiona Noble Carrie\u2019s War, Nina Bawden, 1973 The reality of war for many British children was life far from their families as evacuees, beautifully captured in this evocative but unsentimental adventure. Letters From the Lighthouse, Emma Carrol, 2017 A gripping mystery is combined with a well-observed tale of evacuee life. Themes of prejudice and refugees resonate strongly with current events. Once, Morris Gleitzman, 2005 The horror of the Holocaust unfolds through the eyes of child narrator Felix, in the first of a powerful sequence of novels which stretch from 1942 to the present day. The Lion and the Unicorn, Shirley Hughes, 1998 The emotional impact of a child\u2019s wartime experiences, from fear and loneliness to bravery and courage, are explored in Hughes\u2019s classic picture book. When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit, Judith Kerr, 1971 This semi-autobiographical novel is the first in a trilogy following Anna and her middle-class Jewish family as they flee Nazi Germany and become refugees. Goodnight Mister Tom, Michelle Magorian, 1981 Willie Beech is evacuated to the country where he forms a close bond with the lonely, embittered man who reluctantly takes him in. Salt to the Sea, Ruta Sepetys, 2016 Four young people trek across Germany, bound together by their desperation to reach the ship that means salvation. Winner of the Carnegie Medal. Our Castle by the Sea, Lucy Strange, 2019 From their Kent lighthouse home, Pet\u2019s family face dark days as war looms across the Channel. There\u2019s mythology, espionage and betrayal in this elegant, atmospheric novel. Code Name Verity, Elizabeth Wein, 2012 An unforgettable story of female friendship following the fate of two young British women, one a pilot and one a spy. The Book Thief, Markus Zusak, 2005 It is 1939 and our narrator, Death, has never been busier. An ambitious, devastating portrait of life under the Nazis, for teenage readers and beyond.",

      "bodyText": "The department responsible for managing New South Wales\u2019 ballooning prison population has \u201cno overall drug strategy\u201d and remains \u201csteadfastly opposed\u201d to a needle exchange program in jails, despite the urging of health officials. On Monday a government-commissioned inquiry into ice and other amphetamines turned its attention to drug use among inmates, hearing that as the state\u2019s prison population has exploded, so too has the use of illicit drugs in jails. But despite that, the counsel assisting the commission, Sally Dowling SC, told the inquiry that Corrective Services New South Wales has no overall drug strategy and is actively resisting calls for a needle exchange program made by the Justice Health department. The NSW prison population has exploded since the Coalition government was voted into power in 2011. In her opening address, Dowling said it had grown by about 40% \u2013 from 9,602 to 13,630 inmates \u2013 between 2012 and 2018. At the same time, statistics from the Justice Health department from 2015 showed that two-thirds of the prison population were using crystal methamphetamine before entering a corrections facility, and 41% of all inmates were daily users before being incarcerated. \u201cThat number has increased substantially since then,\u201d Dowling told the inquiry. \u201cApplying the 2015 rate, which is conservative, that means that last year around 8,000 people entered custody with active methamphetamine use. That\u2019s approximately 22 people per day.\u201d The commission, Dowling said, would also hear about the \u201cready availability of drugs in prisons\u201d and the \u201cprevalence of injecting drug use in custody\u201d. The 2015 Justice Health survey found that more than half of participants said drugs were either quite easy or very easy to obtain in jail, and 15.6% reported using methamphetamine while in jail. Dowling revealed to the inquiry that in the first six months of 2019, the number of drug tests on inmates that returned positive results for ice already exceed the 697 found last year, despite 60% fewer tests being conducted. Despite that, she said, the corrective services department \u201cdoes not have an overall drug strategy\u201d. \u201cDespite 8,000 people detoxing from methamphetamine in custody per annum and higher numbers if other drugs are included, there is no system whereby these inmates are targeted for \u2026 treatment support,\u201d she said. She quoted a submission from an official from corrective services who stated that in February this year the department had begun developing a drug strategy. \u201cThis work to date involved conducting a literature review and scan of CSNSW\u2019s existing programs and policies,\u201d the department official said. Dowling said the inquiry would hear evidence that the Justice Health department \u201cactively seeks\u201d a needle exchange program in prisons in NSW to address hepatitis C transmission and \u201cbroader health problems\u201d associated with non-sterile drug injecting. However, she said, the state\u2019s corrective services department is \u201csteadfastly opposed to such a program\u201d. She said the inquiry would hear evidence the corrective department\u2019s harm reduction policy \u201cdoes not comply with international best practice\u201d. She said Justice Health, the entity responsible for providing health services in custody, \u201cadvocates a different approach to caring for injecting drug users in jail, an approach that is rejected by CSNSW\u201d. This week the inquiry will also hear evidence about a lack of drug treatment support outside of prison. Dowling quoted a submission to the inquiry by the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists which stated that post-release support to prevent reoffending in NSW is \u201cinadequate or non-existent in the majority of cases\u201d and that there is \u201ca paucity of services available for ATS users, particularly those with severe mental illness\u201d. A submission from the Shopfront Legal Services called post-custodial support \u201cwoefully inadequate\u201d. The government-commissioned inquiry into the drug ice and other amphetamine-type stimulants is considering legalisation or decriminalisation as a means of addressing growing prevalence of crystal methamphetamine addiction in parts of the state. Established in November last year following a spate of ice-related deaths, the inquiry has heard from a chorus of health and legal experts including the NSW Bar Association, who say the criminalisation of drug addicts may be causing more harm than drug use itself.",

Nowadays, however, Wallace spends little time dwelling on that past: he\u2019s too preoccupied by the threat to the islands\u2019 new-found wealth posed by the UK\u2019s looming departure from the European Union. For much of the 177 years since the Wallace family arrived, the Falklands\u2019 economy was based on mutton exports to the United Kingdom. The likeness of a sheep still appears on the Falkland coat of arms, but the islands\u2019 trade is no longer primarily bound to the the UK \u2013 and their main export no longer grazes on land.

      "bodyText": "After the battle on the streets, comes the battle for their names. Campaigners in Sudan have been unofficially renaming public spaces and roads in the capital Khartoum after those people killed in the uprising that started in December last year and led to the toppling of the dictator Omar al-Bashir in April. \u201cChanging the names of the streets means documenting our revolution. People will keep remembering the martyrs for thousands of years,\u201d said Mohamed Hannen, from the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), one of the main pro-democracy groups. \u201cWe are also changing the \u2026 ideology and building a new Sudan with new names of the streets, and a new way of thinking.\u201d The initiative comes against a backdrop of frustration among young people at the compromises forced on the pro-democracy movement by the military rulers who took power in the aftermath of Bashir\u2019s fall. Sudan\u2019s ruling generals and protest leaders reached an agreement in July to usher in a new period of transitional government. The agreement came after prolonged negotiations between Sudan\u2019s ruling military council and the Alliance for Freedom and Change, which has been leading the protest movement across Sudan for months. Protesters used social media to raise the possibility of naming roads after those killed in recent violence. More than 120 are believed to have been killed when paramilitaries moved in to disperse a protest camp in the centre of Khartoum in June. Others died in separate attacks on demonstrators and activists. The SPA said it supported the initiative after discussions with neighbourhood committees, which have played a key role in the pro-democracy campaign. Many streets and parks were renamed when Bashir came to power more than 30 years ago after fighters killed in the long and bloody conflict in what were then Sudan\u2019s southern provinces. These seceded in 2011 after a referendum. A main road from the airport in Khartoum was named after a prominent fighter killed in South Sudan in 1991. Now the pro-democracy protesters are discussing two new alternatives: Martyrs\u2019 Road, to commemorate those who were killed in recent demonstrations, or Kandaka Road, after the ancient queens who ruled Sudan thousands of years ago. The word was also used to describe the female protesters in the crucial days before Bashir\u2019s fall. Some road signs have already been dismantled and replaced. The Green Space, a huge park next to the airport in Khartoum, was originally named in honour of Muammar Gaddafi, the former Libyan dictator, whose political thinking was published in a \u201cGreen Book\u201d and deployed by Bashir at his rallies. It has been renamed the Freedom Space. Another main road in Khartoum North, which sits on the north bank of the Blue Nile, has been renamed after Mohamed Hashim Mattar, one of the protesters who was killed during the attack on the protest camp in June. The road used to be known as Rescue Street, after a name given to the Bashir government that came to power in 1989. Mattar\u2019s mother said renaming the road after her son gave her a sense of justice. \u201cIt\u2019s nice that people are thinking about him and haven\u2019t forgot about him,\u201d she said in her sitting room, where photos of Mattar were displayed. Another street and square in Khartoum North have had their names changed in honour of Waleed Abdurahman, a protester who was shot and killed while manning a barricade at the Kharoum sit-in. Streets and squares have also been named after Mahjoun Altaj, a medical student who was tortured and killed in January, and Mohamed Dodo, a 16-year-old who was killed while manning a barricade at the sit-in in May.",

At the <em>New Statesman</em> he was political editor during the early days of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/29/new-labour-20-years-on-tony-blair-david-miliband-peter-mandelson-alastair-campbell\" title=\"\">New Labour</a>, and charted their rise and first years in office while achieving the unprecedented and never-to-be-repeated feat of writing the magazine\u2019s political column without being loathed by either Blairites or Brownites. When, years later, I was asked to write in what had been Richards\u2019s slot, the advice I received from Labour grandees was unanimous: study Richards and apply his model to Jeremy Corbyn.</p> <p>As you\u2019d expect, the chapters on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/tonyblair\" title=\"\">Tony Blair</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/gordon-brown\" title=\"\">Gordon Brown</a> are the jewels in the crown, but the entire set glitters. Richards has a nice line in pithy summaries of the politicians who cross his stage \u2013 David Cameron, we are told, \u201cpossessed a sunnier personality than most leaders and yet his ending was uniquely dark\u201d, while Harold Wilson\u2019s deputy, George Brown, \u201cwas a formidable character when sober, but too often he was drunk\u201d.</p> <p>Part of Richards\u2019s gift is making observations that seem so self-evidently correct as to be banal, but are in fact new \u2013 as when he points out that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/margaretthatcher\" title=\"\">Margaret Thatcher</a>\u2019s decision to go to war to retake the Falklands was neither a display of weakness or strength, but simply a reflection on the fact that \u201cthe only alternative to a military response would have been her resignation\u201d.</p> <p>The nine prime ministers he writes about are chosen nominally because they are politicians of what Richards dubs the \u201ctelevision era\u201d, but this is a modest way of obscuring the real reason for picking them, which is that they are prime ministers whom Richards has observed closely, whether, in the case of Wilson, through interviewing his close allies in their later years, or through direct knowledge, as with the other eight.</p> <p>A similar sense of modesty might well have rescued <em>Where Power Stops</em>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/17/political-podcasts-10-of-the-best\" title=\"\">David Runciman</a>\u2019s new collection of essays on political books. I say \u201cnew\u201d: actually, only the introduction and the afterword are new; the rest are revisions of pieces that Runciman penned for the <em>London Review of Books</em>. Collections of this type are always something of a challenge to review: taken singly, the essays are well-written meditations on a biography or memoir of a major political figure; presented together as reflections on the nature of personality and what they reveal about the limits of power renders them irksome. The introduction, which claims that \u201conce we can understand the character of a person, we can follow that character behind the curtain and get to see what is really there\u201d, writes a cheque that the essays cannot cash, because Runciman is not familiar with the character of the people he is writing about \u2013 he is familiar with books written about and by them.</p> <p>If Richards\u2019s overarching theme is \u201cCharacter is destiny. Discuss\u201d, Runciman\u2019s comes dangerously close to \u201cCharacter is destiny. Assert.\u201d Four British prime ministers and four American presidents receive the treatment and it works poorly for most of them. It is only the chapter on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/clinton\" title=\"\">Bill Clinton</a> that survives the transition from review to meditation on power, perhaps because the Clinton book (Taylor Branch\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/oct/11/clinton-tapes-taylor-branch\" title=\"\">The Clinton Tapes</a></em>) is drawn so closely from Clinton\u2019s contemporary thought.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"de664d3529cfb81734da475452731ef8b1f132de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de664d3529cfb81734da475452731ef8b1f132de/0_70_3693_2216/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018By far the sanest president of recent times\u2019: Barack Obama, March 2015\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018By far the sanest president of recent times\u2019: Barack Obama, March 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cBy far the sanest president of recent times was Obama,\u201d Runciman declares. Which may well be true, but Runciman has no way of reliably establishing it. He moves from that assertion to the argument that Obama\u2019s exemplary sanity was the reason he achieved less than Lyndon Johnson as president. A claim that is unknowable is used to justify an argument that is, at best, disputed. Might the differences between the two presidencies not be found in the fact that Johnson received significant cross-party support for all of his great reforms while every one of Obama\u2019s legislative achievements, from healthcare to financial services regulation, were opposed bitterly by the Republicans?</p> <p>That becomes particularly problematic when the assertions are inaccurate. Corbyn, he writes, \u201ctakes time off in lieu whenever he is expected to record a TV interview on a Sunday\u201d, a news story that Corbyn\u2019s office denied at the time and, to the best of my knowledge, is invented from whole cloth. We are told that after May was rebuked for giving a broad speech outside her brief in 2013, she vowed never to do so again and limited herself to \u201ca few half-hearted remarks about the security implications\u201d during the Brexit referendum. The reality is that May gave a long, lucid and expansive address that ranged across much of government policy. May\u2019s pro-remain speech is difficult for historians, because its thoughtfulness and lucidity is so hard to reconcile with how she conducted herself as prime minister, but it can\u2019t simply be wished away in order to service an easy narrative.</p> <p>Such inaccuracies make it hard not to roll one\u2019s eyes. How, I found myself asking time and again, does Runciman reach such confident and wide-ranging conclusions about politicians he does not know and who in some cases are long dead? I was reminded of something that my first boss, the former political commentator Ben Brogan, used to say about David Cameron: that one of his great strengths was that he knew what he did not know. That\u2019s part of the strength of Richards\u2019s <em>The Prime Ministers,</em> and it is the absence of it that makes <em>Where Power Stops</em> fall flat.</p> <p><em>Stephen Bush is political editor of the New Statesman.</em></p> <p><em>This review is from the Observer</em></p> <p><em>\u2022 The Prime Ministers: Reflections on Leadership from Wilson to May</em> by Steve Richards is published by Atlantic Books (\u00a320).

The nine prime ministers he writes about are chosen nominally because they are politicians of what Richards dubs the \u201ctelevision era\u201d, but this is a modest way of obscuring the real reason for picking them, which is that they are prime ministers whom Richards has observed closely, whether, in the case of Wilson, through interviewing his close allies in their later years, or through direct knowledge, as with the other eight. A similar sense of modesty might well have rescued Where Power Stops, David Runciman\u2019s new collection of essays on political books. I say \u201cnew\u201d: actually, only the introduction and the afterword are new; the rest are revisions of pieces that Runciman penned for the London Review of Books. Collections of this type are always something of a challenge to review: taken singly, the essays are well-written meditations on a biography or memoir of a major political figure; presented together as reflections on the nature of personality and what they reveal about the limits of power renders them irksome. The introduction, which claims that \u201conce we can understand the character of a person, we can follow that character behind the curtain and get to see what is really there\u201d, writes a cheque that the essays cannot cash, because Runciman is not familiar with the character of the people he is writing about \u2013 he is familiar with books written about and by them. If Richards\u2019s overarching theme is \u201cCharacter is destiny. Discuss\u201d, Runciman\u2019s comes dangerously close to \u201cCharacter is destiny. Assert.\u201d Four British prime ministers and four American presidents receive the treatment and it works poorly for most of them. It is only the chapter on Bill Clinton that survives the transition from review to meditation on power, perhaps because the Clinton book (Taylor Branch\u2019s The Clinton Tapes) is drawn so closely from Clinton\u2019s contemporary thought. \u201cBy far the sanest president of recent times was Obama,\u201d Runciman declares. Which may well be true, but Runciman has no way of reliably establishing it. He moves from that assertion to the argument that Obama\u2019s exemplary sanity was the reason he achieved less than Lyndon Johnson as president. A claim that is unknowable is used to justify an argument that is, at best, disputed. Might the differences between the two presidencies not be found in the fact that Johnson received significant cross-party support for all of his great reforms while every one of Obama\u2019s legislative achievements, from healthcare to financial services regulation, were opposed bitterly by the Republicans? That becomes particularly problematic when the assertions are inaccurate. Corbyn, he writes, \u201ctakes time off in lieu whenever he is expected to record a TV interview on a Sunday\u201d, a news story that Corbyn\u2019s office denied at the time and, to the best of my knowledge, is invented from whole cloth. We are told that after May was rebuked for giving a broad speech outside her brief in 2013, she vowed never to do so again and limited herself to \u201ca few half-hearted remarks about the security implications\u201d during the Brexit referendum. The reality is that May gave a long, lucid and expansive address that ranged across much of government policy. May\u2019s pro-remain speech is difficult for historians, because its thoughtfulness and lucidity is so hard to reconcile with how she conducted herself as prime minister, but it can\u2019t simply be wished away in order to service an easy narrative. Such inaccuracies make it hard not to roll one\u2019s eyes. How, I found myself asking time and again, does Runciman reach such confident and wide-ranging conclusions about politicians he does not know and who in some cases are long dead? I was reminded of something that my first boss, the former political commentator Ben Brogan, used to say about David Cameron: that one of his great strengths was that he knew what he did not know. That\u2019s part of the strength of Richards\u2019s The Prime Ministers, and it is the absence of it that makes Where Power Stops fall flat. Stephen Bush is political editor of the New Statesman.

      "bodyText": "The inquest into the death in custody of Aboriginal woman Tanya Day has been shown footage of her hitting her forehead on the cell wall less than a minute after she was checked by police. That impact, which occurred shortly before 5pm, caused a brain haemorrhage but was undetected until 8.03pm, when police noticed a lump on her head and called an ambulance. The 55-year-old Yorta Yorta woman died in hospital 17 days later. CCTV footage played in court on Monday shows that Day hit her head five times while in holding cell one at Castlemaine police station on 5 December 2017. It also showed police straightening cushions before they approached Day when they entered the cell at 8.03pm, and bend over her for several seconds before lifting her back on to the bench and covering her with a blanket. The first fall was at 4.20pm, just 25 minutes after she was left alone in the cell to \u201csober up\u201d after being arrested for public drunkenness. It shows she hit the back of her bed after falling back when sitting down on the bed, after roaming unsteadily around the cell. At 4.44pm she stands up, walks unsteadily towards the water fountain on the cell wall, then stumbles backward, hitting the back of her head again as she fell on the bed. At 4.50pm and 40 seconds, two police officers approached the cell from the corridor and peered through the blinds. Less than a minute later, around 4.51pm, Day stands up, walks back towards the bed and falls forward, smacking her forehead on the concrete wall. She holds her head for long moments. At 5.05pm she sits up again and hits her head as she lies back down. She is still lying in that position, unmoving, when police come by again to look through the cell window for 10 seconds at 5.35pm. At 6.39pm the footage shows her falling off the bed on to the floor, where she remained when police checked her again 10 minutes later. Day\u2019s family have requested the footage be released but coroner Caitlin English has said she would reserve her judgment until later in the inquest. They cried in court as the footage was played. Leading senior constable Wayne Cairnes accompanied watch house keeper Danny Wolters to conduct the physical welfare check at 4.50pm. Police guidelines state that intoxicated people should be subject to a physical cell check every 30 minutes, but sergeant Edwina Neale told the inquest she requested 20-minute checks because Day was \u201cmore vulnerable\u201d. Neale said that was then changed to a physical check every 40 minutes, with a check on CCTV monitors in between, because Wolters told her that Day was \u201cbecoming a bit distressed and asking to go home and he felt she would be better if she was left to sleep a bit longer in between checks\u201d. Cairnes initially told the inquest that he saw Day standing in the cell as Wolters called out: \u201cTanya, are you OK?\u201d Due to the thickness of the cell walls, he said, he did not hear what Day said in response, but he said she did give a verbal response and Wolters \u201cseemed satisfied by that\u201d. Timestamped CCTV footage shows Cairnes and Wolters appear in the corridor outside the cell at 16:50:36 and disappear by 16:51:00. They are in front of the cell window, peering through the venetian blinds, for about six seconds. Footage from inside the cell shows that Day is lying on a bench the entire time. She does not move or appear to physically react to their presence. Asked if he agreed that his recollection appeared to be incorrect, Cairnes said: \u201cOf Ms Day standing up, yes it is.\u201d But he rejected a suggestion that police would not have been able to make a \u201cmeaningful assessment\u201d of Day\u2019s condition in so short a time. Cairnes said he did not know why Wolters did not open the hatch on the cell door to speak more clearly with Day, but said that, because she was a woman, Day might be uncomfortable having two male police officers enter the cells. The inquest continues.",

The digital revolution has dramatically altered the way we live and how we are observed, nudged and guided. But who owns all this knowledge and what do they want it for? Why is this interventionist reality watching us so intently, if it only wants to be our friend?</p> <p>Knowledge is power \u2013 a phrase supposedly coined by Francis Bacon in 1597. Two centuries later, Jeremy Bentham advanced the concept of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/23/panopticon-digital-surveillance-jeremy-bentham\" title=\"\">panopticon</a>: a prison where \u201cby blinds and other contrivances\u201d a single guard would be concealed, having \u201cthe most perfect view of every cell\u201d. In reality the guard couldn\u2019t watch everyone all the time, but in his <strong>Panopticon Writings</strong> Bentham argued the mere possibility of surveillance was enough to alter a prisoner\u2019s behaviour and therefore ensure \u201cpower of mind over mind\u201d. Bentham thought this was a great idea; Michel Foucault begged to differ, suggesting in <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/discipline-and-punish.html\" title=\"\">Discipline and Punish</a></strong> that knowledge linked to power not only assumes the authority of \u201cthe truth\u201d but has the power to make itself true.</p> <p>In <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/dark-matters-451759.html\" title=\"\">Dark Matters</a></strong>, Simone Browne notes that Bentham developed his ideas while travelling on a boat carrying slaves \u201cunder the hatches\u201d. A history of the panopticon, she argues, must incorporate 18th-century designs for slave ships, in which a central vantage point permitted a view of all the slaves onboard. The schematic for one such ship (the Brooks, which was built in 1781) depicts \u201ctiny black figures set to represent the enslaved drawn like so many cartoon figures\u201d, Browne writes. Under the panopticon, unique mortals are diminished into a mass, seen through a one-way mirror.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"910745047fad990f222dadbb4ff836c5f77c49f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/910745047fad990f222dadbb4ff836c5f77c49f3/134_0_2601_1560/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Hurt in the 1984 adaptation of Nineteen Eighty-Four.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Hurt in the 1984 adaptation of Nineteen Eighty-Four.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/MGM</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Russian author Yevgeny Zamyatin\u2019s novel <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/may/14/first-personal-plural-narration-novels-stories\" title=\"\">We</a></strong> was banned by the Soviet censorship board in 1921, appearing in an English translation three years later.

      "bodyText": "With immaculate irony, Facebook announced its new cryptocurrency, hoping to bring the financial transactions of its 2.4 billion users on to its platform, in the year that marks 70 years since the publication of George Orwell\u2019s Nineteen Eighty-Four. The digital revolution has dramatically altered the way we live and how we are observed, nudged and guided. But who owns all this knowledge and what do they want it for? Why is this interventionist reality watching us so intently, if it only wants to be our friend? Knowledge is power \u2013 a phrase supposedly coined by Francis Bacon in 1597. Two centuries later, Jeremy Bentham advanced the concept of the panopticon: a prison where \u201cby blinds and other contrivances\u201d a single guard would be concealed, having \u201cthe most perfect view of every cell\u201d. In reality the guard couldn\u2019t watch everyone all the time, but in his Panopticon Writings Bentham argued the mere possibility of surveillance was enough to alter a prisoner\u2019s behaviour and therefore ensure \u201cpower of mind over mind\u201d. Bentham thought this was a great idea; Michel Foucault begged to differ, suggesting in Discipline and Punish that knowledge linked to power not only assumes the authority of \u201cthe truth\u201d but has the power to make itself true. In Dark Matters, Simone Browne notes that Bentham developed his ideas while travelling on a boat carrying slaves \u201cunder the hatches\u201d. A history of the panopticon, she argues, must incorporate 18th-century designs for slave ships, in which a central vantage point permitted a view of all the slaves onboard. The schematic for one such ship (the Brooks, which was built in 1781) depicts \u201ctiny black figures set to represent the enslaved drawn like so many cartoon figures\u201d, Browne writes. Under the panopticon, unique mortals are diminished into a mass, seen through a one-way mirror. The Russian author Yevgeny Zamyatin\u2019s novel We was banned by the Soviet censorship board in 1921, appearing in an English translation three years later. He describes a future society in which all the buildings are made of glass so \u2013 like the panopticon \u2013 everyone can be seen at all times. Orwell reviewed We in 1946, three years before echoing Bentham in his own novel, Nineteen Eighty-Four: \u201cThere was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment. You had to live \u2026 in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in darkness, every movement scrutinised.\u201d Bentham\u2019s vision is also explored in Margaret Atwood\u2019s novel The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, in which inhabitants are monitored by the Eyes \u2013 the secret police of Gilead. There can be no privacy, no meaningful intimate relations, when your friends or lovers may be Eyes as well. In our current era, the watchers are more than human, as Shoshana Zuboff examines in The Age of Surveillance Capitalism.

Our friendly global tech companies are less like soothsayers than magicians, urging us towards a particular card while convincing us it is the one we have freely chosen.

Fed by meltwater from the Bernese Alps, the river has a magical blue colour, and it is perfectly clean to swim in, even in the city centre. The most popular spots are <strong><a href=\"https://www.bern.com/de/detail/marzilibad\" title=\"\">Marzilibad</a></strong>, an area with flat grassy lawns, easy access to the river and an open-air pool \u2013 and <strong><a href=\"https://www.bern.com/de/detail/lorraine-bad\" title=\"\">Lorrainebad</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.bern.com/de/detail/lorraine-bad\" title=\"\">,</a><strong> </strong>a little further downstream. The strength of the current means you need to plan where to get in and, more importantly, where you are going to get out (the exit points are all marked with red railings). Avoid the clearly marked weirs, where swimming is forbidden. There are paddleboards to hire at <a href=\"http://aaresup.tiptotail.ch/\" title=\"\">Tip-to-Tail</a>.

It\u2019s a 10-minute bus ride from the city centre. The fine art museum, <strong><a href=\"https://www.kunstmuseumbern.ch/\" title=\"\">Kunstmuseum Bern</a></strong>, has a good permanent collection featuring Swiss artists such as 20th-century surrealist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/may/28/unconscious-landscape-women-artists-hauser-and-wirth-somerset-review\" title=\"\">M\u00e9ret Oppenheim</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2017/aug/21/guggenheim-exhibition-mystical-symbolism-josephin-peladan-\" title=\"\">Ferdinand Hodler</a>, whose realistic style became \u201cparallelism\u201d.

The former riding school was squatted in the 1980s and in spite of numerous attempts by the authorities to evict the squatters, they have turned the space into a vibrant alternative heart of the city and a welcoming space for everyone (you can stay as long as you like without purchasing food or drink). Inside are bars, a club, a theatre and a good restaurant, <strong><a href=\"https://www.souslepont-roessli.ch/\" title=\"\">Sous le Pont</a> </strong>, where you\u2019re as likely to see businessmen in suits as anarchists. The Vorplatz area outside has pop-up bars and restaurants and on a Friday night is packed with young Bernese. That the Reitschule exists within 50 metres of the swankiest hotel in Berne (the five-star Hotel Schweizerhof) sums up the city for me: Berne packs a lot of variety into a small space.</p> \n<h2><strong>Waterside beds</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c8822a56dbf2048f1a91a81a8ba799c9c2c892a0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8822a56dbf2048f1a91a81a8ba799c9c2c892a0/0_72_1024_614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Riverside bedroom at Bern Youth Hostel, Bern\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bern Youth Hostel</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bern Youth Hostel</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The recently refurbished <strong><a href=\"https://thebristol-bern.ch/en/\" title=\"\">Bristol</a></strong> hotel (doubles from about \u00a3202 B&amp;B \u2013 like the other places listed this includes a <a href=\"https://www.bern.com/en/detail/bern-ticket-free-on-public-transport\" title=\"\">Bern Ticket</a>, which gives guests access to all public transport in the city) offers smart, boutique-style rooms right in the old town. <strong><a href=\"https://www.hotel-jardin.ch/\" title=\"\">Hotel Jardin</a></strong> (doubles from about \u00a3150 B&amp;B) is a family-friendly three-star on the edge of the Lorraine district, a 20-minute walk from the centre. <strong><a href=\"https://www.youthhostel.ch/en/hostels/bern/\" title=\"\">Bern Youth Hostel</a></strong> (dorm beds from about \u00a333, en suite doubles from about \u00a3116) has recently refurbished rooms in a great location between the Marzili swimming area and the old town.

The <strong><a href=\"https://www.bern.com/en/detail/botanic-garden\" title=\"\">Botanical Garden</a></strong> (free entry) has a wonderful range of Alpine plants and is a lovely place to relax by the river.

I live very close by and it\u2019s something I still do regularly. I never get tired of the view over the city: on a clear day you can see all the way to the Eiger, M\u00f6nch and Jungfrau mountains in the Bernese Alps. Nearby is the 13th-century <strong><a href=\"https://www.bern.com/en/detail/berns-clock-tower-zytglogge\" title=\"\">Zytglogge</a></strong> (clock tower) \u2013 probably Berne\u2019s most famous landmark.

IPAs, stouts and porters are the focus here but there are also beers with ingredients like elderflower and cherries when in season. My favourite is a strongly hopped IPA \u2013 though the dark malty stouts are also delicious. Nearby <strong><a href=\"https://brasserie-lorraine.ch/\" title=\"\">Brasserie Lorraine</a></strong> serves unfussy dishes using local, seasonal ingredients (set lunch menu from \u00a314). It has daily vegetarian and vegan options too. The <strong><a href=\"https://www.progr.ch/de/im-progr/turnhalle/\" title=\"\">Turnhalle</a></strong> is a cool cultural space in the city centre, popular for an after-work beer. It\u2019s packed on Friday and Saturday evenings and is a popular hangout for the artists and designers who rent studios in the attached cultural centre, <a href=\"https://www.progr.ch/?t=3\" title=\"\">ProGR</a>.</p> \n<h2><strong>Eat fondue</strong><strong> in summer</strong><br></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84ceb23b84098a40c8bb4b36c3c30ef84610a77d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84ceb23b84098a40c8bb4b36c3c30ef84610a77d/0_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Outdoor tables at Restaurant L\u00f6tschberg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Restaurant L\u00f6tschberg</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: L\u00f6tschberg</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Don\u2019t believe those who tell you melted cheese is just for winter.

      "bodyText": "Urban river swimming Taking a dip in the river is a national pastime here, with the River Aare the basis of the city\u2019s claim to be Europe\u2019s urban swimming capital. Fed by meltwater from the Bernese Alps, the river has a magical blue colour, and it is perfectly clean to swim in, even in the city centre. The most popular spots are Marzilibad, an area with flat grassy lawns, easy access to the river and an open-air pool \u2013 and Lorrainebad, a little further downstream. The strength of the current means you need to plan where to get in and, more importantly, where you are going to get out (the exit points are all marked with red railings). Avoid the clearly marked weirs, where swimming is forbidden. There are paddleboards to hire at Tip-to-Tail. Information about the river\u2019s temperature and the water\u2019s flow rate is updated daily on my website, Aare Guru. The best of Swiss art Switzerland\u2019s museums and art galleries are among the best in the world. The Renzo Piano-designed Paul Klee Zentrum on the outskirsts of Berne houses many of the finest works by the city\u2019s most famous artist and also hosts international exhibitions. It\u2019s a 10-minute bus ride from the city centre. The fine art museum, Kunstmuseum Bern, has a good permanent collection featuring Swiss artists such as 20th-century surrealist M\u00e9ret Oppenheim and Ferdinand Hodler, whose realistic style became \u201cparallelism\u201d. The collection of giant crystals in the Natural History Museum really blew my mind as a child \u2013 I couldn\u2019t believe that such delicate, beautiful things came out of the mountains. Anarchy on the Aare Right next to the main station is one of the city\u2019s most unexpected places: the graffiti-covered Reitschule, or Reithalle. The former riding school was squatted in the 1980s and in spite of numerous attempts by the authorities to evict the squatters, they have turned the space into a vibrant alternative heart of the city and a welcoming space for everyone (you can stay as long as you like without purchasing food or drink). Inside are bars, a club, a theatre and a good restaurant, Sous le Pont , where you\u2019re as likely to see businessmen in suits as anarchists. The Vorplatz area outside has pop-up bars and restaurants and on a Friday night is packed with young Bernese. That the Reitschule exists within 50 metres of the swankiest hotel in Berne (the five-star Hotel Schweizerhof) sums up the city for me: Berne packs a lot of variety into a small space. Waterside beds The recently refurbished Bristol hotel (doubles from about \u00a3202 B&amp;B \u2013 like the other places listed this includes a Bern Ticket, which gives guests access to all public transport in the city) offers smart, boutique-style rooms right in the old town. Hotel Jardin (doubles from about \u00a3150 B&amp;B) is a family-friendly three-star on the edge of the Lorraine district, a 20-minute walk from the centre. Bern Youth Hostel (dorm beds from about \u00a333, en suite doubles from about \u00a3116) has recently refurbished rooms in a great location between the Marzili swimming area and the old town. The cheapest place to stay in the city is Eichholz campsite (open April-end September, adults about \u00a310 plus about \u00a38 for a small tent, dorm-style rooms also available) right on the banks of the Aare and an easy walk from the old town. Ice-cream and chocolate Gelateria di Berna, which has four locations in the city (plus another in Zurich) and is a Bernese institution, creates unusual flavours like hibiscus flower, strawberry and balsamic vinegar, and there\u2019s a chocolate sorbet to die for. A lovely and relaxed place for pastries, coffee and book browsing is Apfelgold. For the best Swiss chocolate, head to L\u00e4derach , which has stores on Marktgasse and in the central station. Every flavour of chocolate you could dream of is laid out in huge slabs on the counter, and sold by weight. Gardens with vistas For the best overview of Berne\u2019s old town, climb up from the river to the Rosengarten (rose garden, free entry). It has a restaurant, and its benches are popular in the colder months as it catches the sun. The Botanical Garden (free entry) has a wonderful range of Alpine plants and is a lovely place to relax by the river. There are good swimming spots here, too. Alternatively, The Gurten is a 858-metre \u201cmountain\u201d (more of a hill, really) overlooking the city. As this is Switzerland, there is a funicular railway to take you to the top and a restaurant on the summit. There are also hiking, running and mountain biking trails on the forested slopes, as well as a 500-metre long summer toboggan run. Cathedrals and clocks Climbing the 100-metre spire of Berne\u2019s cathedral is a must (open daily, adults about \u00a34). I live very close by and it\u2019s something I still do regularly. I never get tired of the view over the city: on a clear day you can see all the way to the Eiger, M\u00f6nch and Jungfrau mountains in the Bernese Alps. Nearby is the 13th-century Zytglogge (clock tower) \u2013 probably Berne\u2019s most famous landmark. A guided tour lets you see the clock mechanism, which was crafted in the 16th century (departs 2.30pm daily or by appointment, adult about \u00a317). Stroll through arcades The Bernese are famously leisurely walkers. The old town\u2019s three miles of medieval shopping arcades, built from local sandstone, allow city folk to shop in comfort, protected from the elements. Try freshly baked bread and patisserie at B\u00e4ckerei Bohnenblust, and pop into Chat Noir for postcards, posters and craft products from local artists, which show that the Swiss design tradition is alive and well. Beer and bears The Altes Tramdepot serves some of the best beer in the city. The Bavarian-style beers are brewed on site next to the famous B\u00e4renPark (bear park). Unlike most places in Berne, the Tramdepot is open on Sundays. There are craft beers to try at BarBi\u00e8re , which is run by a group of friends who started off brewing in their garage before opening this bar in the hip Lorraine district. IPAs, stouts and porters are the focus here but there are also beers with ingredients like elderflower and cherries when in season. My favourite is a strongly hopped IPA \u2013 though the dark malty stouts are also delicious. Nearby Brasserie Lorraine serves unfussy dishes using local, seasonal ingredients (set lunch menu from \u00a314). It has daily vegetarian and vegan options too. The Turnhalle is a cool cultural space in the city centre, popular for an after-work beer. It\u2019s packed on Friday and Saturday evenings and is a popular hangout for the artists and designers who rent studios in the attached cultural centre, ProGR. Eat fondue in summer Don\u2019t believe those who tell you melted cheese is just for winter. The best fondue in Berne is served at Harmonie (mains from around \u00a316), which does quality versions of other classic Swiss dishes too. A good place to sample modern takes on traditional Swiss food is Restaurant L\u00f6tschberg (mains from \u00a316) in the old town. Best time to visit The warm summer and early autumn are the best times for river swimming (a few hardy types swim year round but you have to be OK with 6C water to join in). In winter, snow adds to the magical feel, and a visit can easily be added to a skiing holiday. Getting there Berne is one-hour by train from Basel and Zurich, and two hours from Geneva. Travel by rail from Paris (about 4\u00bd hours), changing at Basel or Strasbourg, costs from \u00a350. Prices Beer (half litre) around \u00a35.50, cappuccino \u00a34, three-course meal for two \u00a385.

A source close to the threatened MPs said: \u201cThis is sheer hypocrisy. Almost a quarter of the current cabinet have voted against the party whip. But this is about the national interest, and we\u2019ve moved beyond the point where threats will persuade people to abandon their principles.\u201d Government sources conceded that losing the MPs\u2019 votes could force Johnson to an election.

One in 10 diagnostic posts are vacant and although survival has improved, \u201cit\u2019s not happening fast enough\u201d, said Emma Greenwood from CRUK. The government wants three-quarters of cancers to be picked up early by 2028 and CRUK says many more will have to be caught at stages 1 and 2 to hit the target.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Rail delays \u2013 </strong>A four-day strike will continue to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/02/disruption-continues-as-south-western-rail-strike-enters-fourth-day\">affect South Western Railway (SWR) services</a> today.

Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, Oxfam and Christian Aid are among those calling for at least \u00a342bn to be allocated over the next three years. It is equivalent to about 2% of economic output each year and 5% of total state spending. Among priorities they list are an \u00a311.6bn expansion in transport spending, including a UK-wide car scrappage scheme to remove polluting vehicles, as much as \u00a32.6bn per year for rewilding projects and land management, and billions for sustainable buildings and industry.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Teacher pay boost confirmed \u2013 </strong>Salaries of newly qualified teachers could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/sep/02/new-teachers-salary-in-england-could-reach-30000-says-dfe\">rise to \u00a330,000 within four years</a>, the government has said, confirming reports by the Guardian. As part of plans to increase recruitment and improve the status of the profession, the government has said it will fully fund higher payments into the teachers\u2019 pension scheme. The National Education Union also wants the government to reinstate statutory pay progression to help retain experienced teachers. Elsewhere in the public finances, the benefits freeze has left a third of those affected with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/02/benefits-freeze-leaves-a-third-of-claimants-with-100-to-live-on-a-month\">less than \u00a3100 a month to live on</a> after paying for rent and life\u2019s essentials, says Citizens Advice.

Deaths have risen by 20% in less than a year, amid such squalor that a Dutch court recently refused to extradite a prisoner to England because of \u201cinhumane and degrading\u201d conditions. A revolution was promised when HMP Berwyn in Wales was opened \u2013 but cost-cutting and compromise have made it the most expensive jail per prisoner in England and Wales, when it was meant to be one of the cheapest, while the conditions are stark, the rate of violence is among the country\u2019s worst, and it is not even full yet.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b5b3100e1102af9587c736e083960990d2abae8e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5b3100e1102af9587c736e083960990d2abae8e/0_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"CGI of the proposed HMP Wellingborough visitor centre\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">CGI of the proposed HMP Wellingborough visitor centre.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bryden Wood</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cIt is against this bleak backdrop that the Ministry of Justice has allowed architects Bryden Wood to promote their plans for HMP Wellingborough, a \u00a3253m 1,600-capacity prison currently under construction in Northamptonshire,\u201d writes Oliver Wainwright, the Guardian\u2019s architecture critic. \u201cThe designs have done away with Victorian-style gallery cell blocks, removed the bars from windows, and arranged the cells in smaller groups around landscaped courtyards \u2026 These details aside, however, it looks very much like business as usual: endless warehouse-like sheds punctuated by tiny square windows, forming an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/sep/02/epic-jail-inside-super-prison-warehouses-architecture\">institutional assembly line for inmates to be processed like Amazon parcels</a>.

      "bodyText": "Top story: \u2018There isn\u2019t a proper negotiation going on\u2019 Hello, Warren Murray with you as we march forward into the week. Leaked government papers suggest all potential alternatives to the Irish border \u201cbackstop\u201d are fraught with difficulty and would leave smaller businesses struggling to cope post-Brexit. The dossier marked \u201cofficial-sensitive\u201d counters the PM\u2019s claim there are \u201cabundant\u201d solutions to avoid a hard border. It shows findings of all advisory groups informing the government on the Irish border are being kept deliberately under wraps while Boris Johnson tries to get a deal without the backstop. Dozens of Conservatives are being threatened with deselection if they break with the government and back legislation to prevent no deal. A source close to the threatened MPs said: \u201cThis is sheer hypocrisy. Almost a quarter of the current cabinet have voted against the party whip. But this is about the national interest, and we\u2019ve moved beyond the point where threats will persuade people to abandon their principles.\u201d Government sources conceded that losing the MPs\u2019 votes could force Johnson to an election. KPMG has warned UK house prices could crash by as much as a fifth if Boris Johnson pursues a no-deal Brexit, with the biggest falls London and Northern Ireland. * * * \u2018Catastrophic\u2019 Dorian \u2013 Hurricane Dorian has struck the Bahamas as a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d category 5 storm bringing winds of more than 180mph (290km/h). It is the equal strongest Atlantic hurricane to make landfall on record, tying with the 1935 Labor Day hurricane. In the Bahamas hundreds of people sheltered in schools, churches and other refuges as authorities made a last-minute plea for those in low-lying areas to evacuate. Dorian is not predicted to make landfall in the US but is still expected to cause danger for Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas in the coming days. We have been covering the situation live. * * * Cancer found too late \u2013 At least 115,000 cancer patients a year in England are diagnosed when their best chance of survival has passed, partly because of a chronic lack of skilled NHS diagnostic staff, says Cancer Research UK. One in 10 diagnostic posts are vacant and although survival has improved, \u201cit\u2019s not happening fast enough\u201d, said Emma Greenwood from CRUK. The government wants three-quarters of cancers to be picked up early by 2028 and CRUK says many more will have to be caught at stages 1 and 2 to hit the target. * * * Rail delays \u2013 A four-day strike will continue to affect South Western Railway (SWR) services today. The company is in dispute with the Rail, Maritime and Transport workers\u2019 union (RMT) over the union\u2019s wish to keep a guard on every train. SWR said it planned to run just over half its normal timetabled services over the course of the strike, which is expected to affect services up to Tuesday morning. Some trains will be cancelled, others replaced with buses and fewer services will run into London Waterloo station. * * * Call for climate crisis funding \u2013 Britain\u2019s biggest environmental groups and charities have warned the government it must double funding to tackle the climate emergency from next year to avoid ecological catastrophe in the future. Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, Oxfam and Christian Aid are among those calling for at least \u00a342bn to be allocated over the next three years. It is equivalent to about 2% of economic output each year and 5% of total state spending. Among priorities they list are an \u00a311.6bn expansion in transport spending, including a UK-wide car scrappage scheme to remove polluting vehicles, as much as \u00a32.6bn per year for rewilding projects and land management, and billions for sustainable buildings and industry. * * * Teacher pay boost confirmed \u2013 Salaries of newly qualified teachers could rise to \u00a330,000 within four years, the government has said, confirming reports by the Guardian. As part of plans to increase recruitment and improve the status of the profession, the government has said it will fully fund higher payments into the teachers\u2019 pension scheme. The National Education Union also wants the government to reinstate statutory pay progression to help retain experienced teachers. Elsewhere in the public finances, the benefits freeze has left a third of those affected with less than \u00a3100 a month to live on after paying for rent and life\u2019s essentials, says Citizens Advice. The government says there are no plans for the freeze to go beyond March 2020. * * * Peaky district \u2013 Birmingham attracted a record number of tourists in 2018 as fans of Peaky Blinders flocked to explore the world associated with the BBC gangster series. The UK\u2019s second-largest city and the wider West Midlands region are becoming significant beneficiaries of the growing phenomenon of so-called \u201cscreen tourism\u201d, where fans base a holiday on visiting locations related to popular films and TV shows. The TV show isn\u2019t shot in Birmingham \u2013 streets in Greater Manchester and Liverpool are used, but the Black Country Living Museum in Dudley has been a staple filming location in all five series. Today in Focus podcast: The man who gave birth Freddy McConnell is a Guardian journalist and trans man who in 2016 decided to begin the process of conceiving and delivering a child. The film he made about the experience is in cinemas now. And: Andrew Rawnsley on the anniversary of the second world war. Lunchtime read: Epic jail Boris Johnson\u2019s announcement of 10,000 extra prison places comes at a time when jails are beset by overcrowding, drug use, mental illness and self-harm. Deaths have risen by 20% in less than a year, amid such squalor that a Dutch court recently refused to extradite a prisoner to England because of \u201cinhumane and degrading\u201d conditions. A revolution was promised when HMP Berwyn in Wales was opened \u2013 but cost-cutting and compromise have made it the most expensive jail per prisoner in England and Wales, when it was meant to be one of the cheapest, while the conditions are stark, the rate of violence is among the country\u2019s worst, and it is not even full yet. \u201cIt is against this bleak backdrop that the Ministry of Justice has allowed architects Bryden Wood to promote their plans for HMP Wellingborough, a \u00a3253m 1,600-capacity prison currently under construction in Northamptonshire,\u201d writes Oliver Wainwright, the Guardian\u2019s architecture critic. \u201cThe designs have done away with Victorian-style gallery cell blocks, removed the bars from windows, and arranged the cells in smaller groups around landscaped courtyards \u2026 These details aside, however, it looks very much like business as usual: endless warehouse-like sheds punctuated by tiny square windows, forming an institutional assembly line for inmates to be processed like Amazon parcels. So are we stuck with a template basically unchanged since the publication of Hints for the Improvements of Prisons in 1817, which prescribed that the buildings should be \u201cmade as gloomy and melancholy as possible\u201d? Sport Mauricio Pochettino felt that Tottenham recovered their togetherness during Sunday\u2019s helter-skelter 2-2 draw at Arsenal after a difficult start to the season and a raft of problems behind the scenes. Johanna Konta conquered her nerves and her opponent, Karolina Pliskova, in three compelling sets to become the first British woman to reach the quarter-finals of the US Open since Jo Durie 36 years ago. Serena Williams eased through a potentially tricky fourth-round meeting with Petra Martic, while Roger Federer comfortably beat David Goffin, winning 6-2, 6-2, 6-0 against the player who grew up idolising him. Charles Leclerc described his maiden Formula One victory as the realisation of a childhood dream but one that he would find difficult to enjoy after the death of his friend Anthoine Hubert. Eddie Hearn has called for the introduction of VAR into British boxing after video replays came to the rescue of the WBC flyweight champion Charlie Edwards. The England midfielder Jade Moore has expressed frustration that poor scheduling is stunting preparations for the new Women\u2019s Super League season. And Western Storm have become the first team to win the Kia Super League title twice, repeating their feat from 2017 against the same opposition as they once again pipped Southern Vipers at the post. Business Global stock prices have fallen after the US and China imposed new tariffs on each other\u2019s goods. Tokyo and Hong Kong declined. MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 0.3% led by the drop in the Hang Seng after another weekend of violent anti-government protests. Mainland Chinese shares fared better, with the CSI300 index rising 0.3% despite the trade row escalation. At the time of writing the pound is worth $1.215 and \u20ac1.106 while the FTSE looks like opening higher. The papers The Guardian leads with \u201cJohnson ready to sacrifice majority by withdrawing whip from rebels\u201d. The Telegraph has \u201cPM warns rebel MPs: back me or be sacked\u201d. The Times\u2019 headline is \u201cI\u2019ll kick you out of the party, Johnson tells Tory rebels\u201d. The FT zeroes in on what a Corbyn government might do: \u201cLabour would cost UK companies \u00a3300bn by shifting shares to staff\u201d, as it predicts an election is \u201clikely\u201d amid Brexit turmoil. The Express leads on the PM\u2019s threat to Tory MPs who don\u2019t toe his line: \u201cBoris vows to boot out Brexit rebels\u201d. The Mail echoes the Telegraph: \u201cBack me or I\u2019ll sack you\u201d. The i has \u201cFury at Gove warning on Commons no-deal vote\u201d. The Mirror and the Sun sidestep Brexit. \u201cBrits kill monkeys for \u2018fun\u2019\u201d is the Mirror\u2019s headline \u2013 it reports on what it calls \u201ctrophy hunt scandals\u201d where tourists are killing animals \u201con sick safaris\u201d. The Sun leads on Kellie Maloney\u2019s revelation that she attempted suicide after missing her former life as a male boxing promoter: \u201cKellie: I overdosed because I missed being Frank\u201d.

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s a very hard thing to do, to write about mental health issues with humour. There are so many possible missteps, especially during a heightened \u201ccancel\u201d culture. But it is clear the actor and comedian \u2013 and now writer and producer \u2013 Aisling Bea has nailed it in <a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/programmes/this-way-up/on-demand/65230-001\">This Way Up</a>, when, in the very first scene, her character, Aine, on leaving an expensive inpatient mental health facility, makes a comment about the lack of snacks and Jacuzzi.</p> <p>The first time I was a private inpatient, I campaigned to switch the decaf coffee for proper coffee, and made a point about the tepid, dribbling showers \u2013 apparently a safety thing, which I still don\u2019t understand, because who tries to self-harm with water pressure? \u201cJust some feedback \u2026\u201d says Aine\u2019s sister Shona (played by Sharon Horgan) to the receptionist. When an opening scene is as authentic as this, the tone and plot so perfectly, instantly established and recognisable \u2013 you know good things are to come.</p> <p>This Way Up focuses on Aine, an Irish woman living in London, who works as an English-as-a-foreign-language tutor, is very good at her job and clearly cares for her students. She is funny and engaging in the classroom, in contrast to the loneliness she feels in her personal life, as she gets back on her feet after what whispers refer to as a \u201cbreakdown\u201d. It\u2019s a show about recovery \u2013 hence the title \u2013 and everything that entails. Its original title was Happy AF.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2mcCLjUb8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dw2mcCLjUb8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Funny and engaging ... This Way Up.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>This Way Up has been a long time in the making. Bea mentioned it \u2013 as well as other projects with Horgan \u2013 to me a few years ago. It is written by Bea and executive-produced by the pair (and made by Merman, Horgan\u2019s production company). Back then, Bea referred to Horgan as a sort of older sister. Given that, the onscreen chemistry between the two makes perfect sense.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/press/news/first-look-image-and-casting-announced-c4s-aisling-bea-comedy-way\">In Channel 4\u2019s press release</a>, she explains: \u201cSharon and I first played sisters in a TV show that got cancelled about eight years ago, and we have gone on many drunken nights out since to stay in character.\u201d</p> <p>In This Way Up, Horgan displays the comic timing for which she is known, but we also get to see more of her straight acting. Shona struggles with the emotional labour of looking after \u2013 and constantly worrying about \u2013 a loved one who (it is heavily hinted) has attempted suicide, while being in her early 40s and facing the societal pressures of marriage and kids, which she is pretty sure she doesn\u2019t want. Meanwhile, there\u2019s a potential new sexual awakening outside her relationship and the difficulties of a workplace dominated by privately educated men.</p> <p>The sisterly bond between Aine and Shona is as good a creation as the one we saw in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/fleabag\">Fleabag</a>. The touches of uproarious laughter (doing Hannibal Lecter impressions when wearing face masks); the frustrations (\u201cOh, eat my ass, Shona!\u201d \u201cEat <em>my ass</em>!\u201d); the things kept to oneself. It is a relationship with multiple hues and textures but bound together with a double helix. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c013527b7e264d994bafc75cc2ef6c993eb57206\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c013527b7e264d994bafc75cc2ef6c993eb57206/539_0_1812_1887/960.jpg\" alt=\"The back and forth of falling in love ...

Tobias Menzies and Aisling Bea.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As for the subject of mental health, Bea <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/04/aisling-bea-my-fathers-death-has-given-me-a-love-of-men-of-their-vulnerability-and-tenderness\">wrote </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/04/aisling-bea-my-fathers-death-has-given-me-a-love-of-men-of-their-vulnerability-and-tenderness\">in the Guardian</a> in 2017 about her father, a \u201ccharismatic, handsome vet\u201d who took his own life, and has <a href=\"https://www.irishnews.com/lifestyle/2019/08/06/news/aisling-bea-talking-about-mental-health-or-suicide-doesn-t-make-you-not-funny--1676526/\">talked about her own experiences</a> of depression. She gets the random turmoil of it: the unwise sexual dalliances; the awkward jokes; the making your way back into the outside world, sometimes feeling that others are speaking an accented language that leaves you adrift. The feeling of being reduced to a child, because episodes of mental ill health can be infantilising.</p> <p>I almost caught my breath when Aine sinks to the floor of a bathroom, in the way that I have squatted under a shower with not enough energy to stand. But also, the coping mechanisms and shield of humour, sometimes combative, other times self-deprecating. In This Way Up, it is Aine referring to her inpatient stint as a \u201cteeny little nervous breakdown\u201d. In real life, it was a doctor enquiring what it was that had stopped me chucking myself in front of a bus and me replying that, as it drew closer, I saw the \u201csorry not in service\u201d sign.</p> <p>This Way Up has a diverse cast: not, as rightwing commentators would have it, because of political correctness, but because it is set in London. Aine\u2019s boss is a black man, her flatmate is a black man; her students are all immigrants (as, of course, are Aine and Shona). The two leads, as well as Charlotte, Shona\u2019s colleague, are, in the parlance of criticism, \u201cstrong female characters\u201d. Because that is real life. Charlotte is a brown, gay woman in a world of \u201crah\u201d bankers.</p> <p>I haven\u2019t even touched on the nuanced and complex relationship Aine has with her mother, played beautifully (if briefly) by Sorcha Cusack, who nails an emotionally fraught monologue when the two are left alone together. Or the back and forth of falling in love, or falling out of love; the staring at ceilings in the night.</p> <p>While I was writing this, Bea left me a voicemail explaining she has been overwhelmed by the positive reaction to the show. It has been praised by the likes of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/robdelaney/status/1164222259294277632\">Rob Delaney</a> and gained many fans. It is now available in the US on Hulu.</p> <p>Bea has said that, before the show aired, she <a href=\"https://www.irishnews.com/lifestyle/2019/08/06/news/aisling-bea-talking-about-mental-health-or-suicide-doesn-t-make-you-not-funny--1676526/\">decided not to catastrophise</a> about the reaction. \u201cI actively decided for myself, for the first time in my life, to not allow myself to do that, and to maybe believe compliments and lean in,\u201d she told the Irish Times.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B1M-F0egPvt/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s a very hard thing to do, to write about mental health issues with humour. There are so many possible missteps, especially during a heightened \u201ccancel\u201d culture. But it is clear the actor and comedian \u2013 and now writer and producer \u2013 Aisling Bea has nailed it in This Way Up, when, in the very first scene, her character, Aine, on leaving an expensive inpatient mental health facility, makes a comment about the lack of snacks and Jacuzzi. The first time I was a private inpatient, I campaigned to switch the decaf coffee for proper coffee, and made a point about the tepid, dribbling showers \u2013 apparently a safety thing, which I still don\u2019t understand, because who tries to self-harm with water pressure? \u201cJust some feedback \u2026\u201d says Aine\u2019s sister Shona (played by Sharon Horgan) to the receptionist. When an opening scene is as authentic as this, the tone and plot so perfectly, instantly established and recognisable \u2013 you know good things are to come. This Way Up focuses on Aine, an Irish woman living in London, who works as an English-as-a-foreign-language tutor, is very good at her job and clearly cares for her students. She is funny and engaging in the classroom, in contrast to the loneliness she feels in her personal life, as she gets back on her feet after what whispers refer to as a \u201cbreakdown\u201d. It\u2019s a show about recovery \u2013 hence the title \u2013 and everything that entails. Its original title was Happy AF. This Way Up has been a long time in the making. Bea mentioned it \u2013 as well as other projects with Horgan \u2013 to me a few years ago. It is written by Bea and executive-produced by the pair (and made by Merman, Horgan\u2019s production company). Back then, Bea referred to Horgan as a sort of older sister. Given that, the onscreen chemistry between the two makes perfect sense. In Channel 4\u2019s press release, she explains: \u201cSharon and I first played sisters in a TV show that got cancelled about eight years ago, and we have gone on many drunken nights out since to stay in character.\u201d In This Way Up, Horgan displays the comic timing for which she is known, but we also get to see more of her straight acting. Shona struggles with the emotional labour of looking after \u2013 and constantly worrying about \u2013 a loved one who (it is heavily hinted) has attempted suicide, while being in her early 40s and facing the societal pressures of marriage and kids, which she is pretty sure she doesn\u2019t want. Meanwhile, there\u2019s a potential new sexual awakening outside her relationship and the difficulties of a workplace dominated by privately educated men. The sisterly bond between Aine and Shona is as good a creation as the one we saw in Fleabag. The touches of uproarious laughter (doing Hannibal Lecter impressions when wearing face masks); the frustrations (\u201cOh, eat my ass, Shona!\u201d \u201cEat my ass!\u201d); the things kept to oneself. It is a relationship with multiple hues and textures but bound together with a double helix. As for the subject of mental health, Bea wrote in the Guardian in 2017 about her father, a \u201ccharismatic, handsome vet\u201d who took his own life, and has talked about her own experiences of depression. She gets the random turmoil of it: the unwise sexual dalliances; the awkward jokes; the making your way back into the outside world, sometimes feeling that others are speaking an accented language that leaves you adrift. The feeling of being reduced to a child, because episodes of mental ill health can be infantilising. I almost caught my breath when Aine sinks to the floor of a bathroom, in the way that I have squatted under a shower with not enough energy to stand. But also, the coping mechanisms and shield of humour, sometimes combative, other times self-deprecating. In This Way Up, it is Aine referring to her inpatient stint as a \u201cteeny little nervous breakdown\u201d. In real life, it was a doctor enquiring what it was that had stopped me chucking myself in front of a bus and me replying that, as it drew closer, I saw the \u201csorry not in service\u201d sign. This Way Up has a diverse cast: not, as rightwing commentators would have it, because of political correctness, but because it is set in London. Aine\u2019s boss is a black man, her flatmate is a black man; her students are all immigrants (as, of course, are Aine and Shona). The two leads, as well as Charlotte, Shona\u2019s colleague, are, in the parlance of criticism, \u201cstrong female characters\u201d. Because that is real life. Charlotte is a brown, gay woman in a world of \u201crah\u201d bankers. I haven\u2019t even touched on the nuanced and complex relationship Aine has with her mother, played beautifully (if briefly) by Sorcha Cusack, who nails an emotionally fraught monologue when the two are left alone together. Or the back and forth of falling in love, or falling out of love; the staring at ceilings in the night. While I was writing this, Bea left me a voicemail explaining she has been overwhelmed by the positive reaction to the show. It has been praised by the likes of Rob Delaney and gained many fans. It is now available in the US on Hulu. Bea has said that, before the show aired, she decided not to catastrophise about the reaction. \u201cI actively decided for myself, for the first time in my life, to not allow myself to do that, and to maybe believe compliments and lean in,\u201d she told the Irish Times. I didn\u2019t see much of Bea\u2019s work on panel shows, but her regular stints gained her a legion of fans. Now, with This Way Up, she joins a crop of new television auteurs variously producing and writing, as well as acting in their creations: Abbi Jacobson and Ilana Glazer\u2019s Broad City; Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s Fleabag; Charlie Covell\u2019s The End of the F****ing World; Natasha Lyonne\u2019s Russian Doll; and Mae Martin\u2019s forthcoming Mae and George (working title). As Bea herself has put it (and worn on a T-shirt): \u201cFemale is not a genre.\u201d None of these shows are the same or themed around gender; it is just that, finally, women are getting a fair crack. As many of the above have noted, the only way they felt they could play the roles they wanted was to write them themselves. To be clear: This Way Up also had me doubled up with laughter, not just nodding along with the darker moments. I would also shout out the fact that, as with many of the most recent successful shows, it is concise: just six 24-minute episodes.. It seems clear that a second series of This Way Up will follow, given the cliffhangers for Aine the other characters. And it seems \u2026 things are looking up? This way forward, then.",

The answer for most people will probably be the internal structure, the colour of the walls, the light entering through the windows. But stay a little longer and you might start to experience the space differently: you\u2019ll hear sound reverberating, you\u2019ll feel air currents, textures and materials, you\u2019ll smell wafts from the kitchen. For blind people, this multi-sensory experience is their first impression of a space. And now a new programme is trying to harness that unique ability by training more visually impaired people to become architects. As the first step in running a foundation course aimed at people who see things differently, the Bartlett School of Architecture at UCL ran an architecture and design workshop for people with visual impairments this summer. \u201cGoing to start an architecture degree as a visually impaired person is so horrendously daunting, there\u2019s so much that\u2019s inaccessible,\u201d said one of the students on the five-day course, Poppy Levison, who is about to start studying at Central Saint Martins. \u201cI\u2019ve been brought up to analyse spaces,\u201d she says. \u201cI remember my vision support worker when I was four asking: \u2018Is it better if the window\u2019s behind you in the classroom?\u2019 It\u2019s something I\u2019ve always been asked to think about.\u201d One key exercise in the workshop involves documenting how different spaces make you feel.

      "body": "<p>Helen Hunt was 34 when she won the best actress Oscar for As Good As It Gets, and the attention made her anxious. \u201cIt was a very famous time. I felt quite nervous because I was being followed,\u201d she says. \u201cI remember thinking: \u2018What if I can\u2019t turn this off? Am I always going to be walking to my car and there are people with cameras there? Does this last for ever?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The answer was no. Hunt is 56 now, and the intervening decades have brought her a more interesting, but intrinsically more private life. After starting her career as a television actor at the age of nine, she has forged a successful life behind the camera, as well as in front of it.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I have that kind of fame now,\u201d she says. \u201cI haven\u2019t been, in my personal life, so intriguing that I\u2019ll always be that famous. I haven\u2019t tried to make that happen. I\u2019d like to be well known so I can get more jobs, but it has quietened down.\u201d</p> <p>Does she remember the turning point? She traces it back to 2004, when she had her daughter, Makena Lei. \u201cI spent much less time working and doing interviews and more time in private, so it just naturally quietened down and that was nice. I don\u2019t get followed any more, and it doesn\u2019t disturb my life. I get good theatre tickets, and that\u2019s worth all of it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"449781df69790ff6ddefb0923bbe810ca0600478\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/449781df69790ff6ddefb0923bbe810ca0600478/0_0_3133_2070/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hunt with Jack Nicholson in the 1997 film As Good As It Gets.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"661\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hunt with Jack Nicholson in the 1997 film As Good As It Gets.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristar Pictures/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Much has been made of the idea that Hunt stepped away from the public eye after the release of four high-profile films in 2000: What Women Want, Cast Away, Pay It Forward and Dr T &amp; the Women. But she sees it very differently. \u201cIt\u2019s so funny when people ask: \u2018What happened to you?\u2019 Well, I had a baby \u2013 I made a whole person \u2013 and I co-wrote, directed and produced two entire films so it didn\u2019t seem so quiet to me. There\u2019s a difference between working hard and being famous.\u201d</p> <p>The films she is referring to are Then She Found Me (2007) and Ride (2014). The former centres on the complicated relationship between a 39-year-old woman (Hunt), who is estranged from her husband and longs for a child, and her biological mother (Bette Midler), who reappears in her life after the death of her adoptive mother. The film is loosely based on a novel by Elinor Lipman, but Hunt included a fertility struggle because, at the time, she was trying to get pregnant and it was all she could think about. \u201cHaving a biological clock pounding in my ears, I thought: \u2018Well, if I\u2019m going to play this part, she\u2019s got to either have a baby or want to have a baby.\u201d</p> <p>Hunt spent 10 years getting the film off the ground, only for the distributor, Think Film, to go bankrupt before the film\u2019s release, meaning there was no promotion and no advertising.</p> <p>\u201cThat was the most crushing \u2026\u201d she breaks off. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take away from the experience of making it, but then you want people to see what you did. So that was hard; that was very hard.\u201d In interviews from that time, she comes across as defensive and prickly. In hindsight, she was probably heartbroken. \u201cI would like to blink and have everybody in the world have seen it,\u201d she says now.</p> <p>When we meet in Los Angeles, she has come straight from the writers\u2019 room for the forthcoming reboot of Mad About You. The US comedy, about a newly married New York couple, ran from 1992 to 1999. Hunt won three Golden Globes for her razor-sharp portrayal of PR Jamie Buchman. She and her co-star, Paul Reiser (who played Jamie\u2019s husband), will executive produce and star in 12 new episodes. Hunt will also direct the first episode, having recently served as a director on episodes of the major US hits This Is Us and Feud, as well as The Politician, Ryan Murphy\u2019s latest big project for Netflix.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8dbe29892e1f266b72c9c8ca75253128302d60f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8dbe29892e1f266b72c9c8ca75253128302d60f1/0_0_3000_1956/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Helen Hunt with (left) Paul Reiser as her husband and Kevin Bacon as himself in Mad About You.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"652\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hunt with (left) Paul Reiser as her husband and Kevin Bacon as himself in Mad About You.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NBC/NBC via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m concerned that we\u2019ll wreck it,\u201d she says of Mad About You. \u201cBut you never know. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to be good in something, that\u2019s what makes it exciting; the risk that it might not go well. I\u2019m pretty practised at putting the worry aside.\u201d</p> <p>She and her daughter, who is now 15, are both politically engaged. They have attended marches together, including the Women\u2019s March held the day after Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration. Hunt has been active in fighting for equality on the Mad About You reboot. Most of the 11 directors are women, including women of colour. \u201cI\u2019ve tried very hard to fight for pay parity,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s much harder than you think. People who pay the money say: \u2018Well, I want pay parity, but this man has more experience.\u2019 To which we\u2019re replying: \u2018Yes, but what was the context? Was this woman given the same opportunities as this man?\u2019 It\u2019s entirely possible he had more options than she did, so we fight for pay parity in order to take that context into account.\u201d</p> <p>It is not something she thought about when starring opposite, say, Jack Nicholson in As Good As It Gets or Tom Hanks in Cast Away. \u201cAt that point in my career, I didn\u2019t know to fight for it. It never occurred to me I should be paid the same amount. Quite frankly, they could have argued people were buying tickets because of Jack or Tom, and that would have been correct.\u201d</p> <p>Has she noticed any other changes in the industry since the advent of the Time\u2019s Up movement? \u201cI think it has made movie sets somewhat safer; there\u2019s some amount of recourse if you feel in danger or objectified,\u201d she says. \u201cIt does feel like now you could get in trouble, and thank God.\u201d</p> <p>Over the years, she has worked with Mel Gibson, Kevin Spacey and Woody Allen. Should we be boycotting their work? \u201cHere\u2019s the only thing I can really contribute,\u201d she says, choosing her words carefully. \u201cI think a big part of the problem is that if a woman is assaulted, by the time they feel they can get the words out of their mouth, there are statute of limitation laws that say \u2018too late\u2019. So, while I understand the backlash of, \u2018you just point a finger at me and my career\u2019s over\u2019, until those laws are revised, it\u2019s going to be a giant, painful mess and it shouldn\u2019t be only up to the women who have been victimised to metabolise that.

      "bodyText": "Helen Hunt was 34 when she won the best actress Oscar for As Good As It Gets, and the attention made her anxious. \u201cIt was a very famous time. I felt quite nervous because I was being followed,\u201d she says. \u201cI remember thinking: \u2018What if I can\u2019t turn this off? Am I always going to be walking to my car and there are people with cameras there? Does this last for ever?\u2019\u201d The answer was no. Hunt is 56 now, and the intervening decades have brought her a more interesting, but intrinsically more private life. After starting her career as a television actor at the age of nine, she has forged a successful life behind the camera, as well as in front of it. \u201cI don\u2019t think I have that kind of fame now,\u201d she says. \u201cI haven\u2019t been, in my personal life, so intriguing that I\u2019ll always be that famous. I haven\u2019t tried to make that happen. I\u2019d like to be well known so I can get more jobs, but it has quietened down.\u201d Does she remember the turning point? She traces it back to 2004, when she had her daughter, Makena Lei. \u201cI spent much less time working and doing interviews and more time in private, so it just naturally quietened down and that was nice. I don\u2019t get followed any more, and it doesn\u2019t disturb my life. I get good theatre tickets, and that\u2019s worth all of it.\u201d Much has been made of the idea that Hunt stepped away from the public eye after the release of four high-profile films in 2000: What Women Want, Cast Away, Pay It Forward and Dr T &amp; the Women. But she sees it very differently. \u201cIt\u2019s so funny when people ask: \u2018What happened to you?\u2019 Well, I had a baby \u2013 I made a whole person \u2013 and I co-wrote, directed and produced two entire films so it didn\u2019t seem so quiet to me. There\u2019s a difference between working hard and being famous.\u201d The films she is referring to are Then She Found Me (2007) and Ride (2014). The former centres on the complicated relationship between a 39-year-old woman (Hunt), who is estranged from her husband and longs for a child, and her biological mother (Bette Midler), who reappears in her life after the death of her adoptive mother. The film is loosely based on a novel by Elinor Lipman, but Hunt included a fertility struggle because, at the time, she was trying to get pregnant and it was all she could think about. \u201cHaving a biological clock pounding in my ears, I thought: \u2018Well, if I\u2019m going to play this part, she\u2019s got to either have a baby or want to have a baby.\u201d Hunt spent 10 years getting the film off the ground, only for the distributor, Think Film, to go bankrupt before the film\u2019s release, meaning there was no promotion and no advertising. \u201cThat was the most crushing \u2026\u201d she breaks off. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take away from the experience of making it, but then you want people to see what you did. So that was hard; that was very hard.\u201d In interviews from that time, she comes across as defensive and prickly. In hindsight, she was probably heartbroken. \u201cI would like to blink and have everybody in the world have seen it,\u201d she says now. When we meet in Los Angeles, she has come straight from the writers\u2019 room for the forthcoming reboot of Mad About You. The US comedy, about a newly married New York couple, ran from 1992 to 1999. Hunt won three Golden Globes for her razor-sharp portrayal of PR Jamie Buchman. She and her co-star, Paul Reiser (who played Jamie\u2019s husband), will executive produce and star in 12 new episodes. Hunt will also direct the first episode, having recently served as a director on episodes of the major US hits This Is Us and Feud, as well as The Politician, Ryan Murphy\u2019s latest big project for Netflix. \u201cI\u2019m concerned that we\u2019ll wreck it,\u201d she says of Mad About You. \u201cBut you never know. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to be good in something, that\u2019s what makes it exciting; the risk that it might not go well. I\u2019m pretty practised at putting the worry aside.\u201d She and her daughter, who is now 15, are both politically engaged. They have attended marches together, including the Women\u2019s March held the day after Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration. Hunt has been active in fighting for equality on the Mad About You reboot. Most of the 11 directors are women, including women of colour. \u201cI\u2019ve tried very hard to fight for pay parity,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s much harder than you think. People who pay the money say: \u2018Well, I want pay parity, but this man has more experience.\u2019 To which we\u2019re replying: \u2018Yes, but what was the context? Was this woman given the same opportunities as this man?\u2019 It\u2019s entirely possible he had more options than she did, so we fight for pay parity in order to take that context into account.\u201d It is not something she thought about when starring opposite, say, Jack Nicholson in As Good As It Gets or Tom Hanks in Cast Away. \u201cAt that point in my career, I didn\u2019t know to fight for it. It never occurred to me I should be paid the same amount. Quite frankly, they could have argued people were buying tickets because of Jack or Tom, and that would have been correct.\u201d Has she noticed any other changes in the industry since the advent of the Time\u2019s Up movement? \u201cI think it has made movie sets somewhat safer; there\u2019s some amount of recourse if you feel in danger or objectified,\u201d she says. \u201cIt does feel like now you could get in trouble, and thank God.\u201d Over the years, she has worked with Mel Gibson, Kevin Spacey and Woody Allen. Should we be boycotting their work? \u201cHere\u2019s the only thing I can really contribute,\u201d she says, choosing her words carefully. \u201cI think a big part of the problem is that if a woman is assaulted, by the time they feel they can get the words out of their mouth, there are statute of limitation laws that say \u2018too late\u2019. So, while I understand the backlash of, \u2018you just point a finger at me and my career\u2019s over\u2019, until those laws are revised, it\u2019s going to be a giant, painful mess and it shouldn\u2019t be only up to the women who have been victimised to metabolise that. That issue is bigger than anybody sees. My understanding is that it has much more to do with a backlog in court. That\u2019s a real problem.\u201d She has been exploring issues around sexual violence in her latest role, in the new BBC One drama World on Fire. Hunt plays Nancy Campbell, a war correspondent who is a victim of sexual violence, loosely based on the trailblazing British journalist Clare Hollingworth, who broke the news of the outbreak of the second world war. Hunt did meticulous research, for better or worse. \u201cOn that set, I began to know things that some people don\u2019t, unless you do a deep dive in that particular area. Of course, there\u2019s sexual violence everywhere \u2013 it\u2019s one of the great atrocities of our age \u2013 but I didn\u2019t understand it was as institutionalised and organised.

The conventional way to tell the story of <a href=\"http://taybridgedisaster.co.uk/\">the rail bridge disaster of 1879</a>, when 75 people lost their lives on the crossing from Wormit to Dundee, would be to dramatise the facts of the case: engineer Sir Thomas Bouch, the grieving relatives, the public enquiry and the compellingly terrible poem by William McGonagall. (\u201cIt must have been an awful sight / To witness in the dusky moonlight.\u201d) Arnott has none of that. Instead, he imagines a kind of ghost-train-in-waiting and presents a sequence of vignettes about passengers who have nothing in common but their fate. By rights, such a theatrical collage could come across as fragmentary, but he pulls it off brilliantly thanks to vivid writing, political nous and thematic unity.</p> <p>As is the nature of journeys, the passengers are in transition, changing jobs, beginning new lives, reinventing themselves, and yet already they seem stalked by death. They\u2019re like a congregation reflecting on the journey of life, with Dundee as heaven and the Tay as a watery purgatory.</p> <p>The journey is made smooth by Andrew Panton\u2019s excellent production, kicking off <a href=\"https://www.dundeerep.co.uk/article/dundee-rep-and-scottish-dance-theatre-19-20-season-announced\">a double-anniversary season</a> to mark 80 years of the theatre and 20 years of the permanent ensemble. With strong performances all around, the cast seem to haunt the broken carriage of designer Emily James\u2019s rotating set as it mutates into pubs, classrooms and tenements with dream-like fluidity. Simon Wilkinson\u2019s ominous lighting and MJ McCarthy\u2019s rib-shaking sound design build to the closing moments when the inevitable ending gives shape and force to Arnott\u2019s adventurous structure.</p> <p>\u2022 At <a href=\"https://www.dundeerep.co.uk/event/tay-bridge\">Dundee Rep</a> until 21 September.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Peter Arnott has written enough plays to know you\u2019re not supposed to structure them like this. The conventional way to tell the story of the rail bridge disaster of 1879, when 75 people lost their lives on the crossing from Wormit to Dundee, would be to dramatise the facts of the case: engineer Sir Thomas Bouch, the grieving relatives, the public enquiry and the compellingly terrible poem by William McGonagall. (\u201cIt must have been an awful sight / To witness in the dusky moonlight.\u201d) Arnott has none of that. Instead, he imagines a kind of ghost-train-in-waiting and presents a sequence of vignettes about passengers who have nothing in common but their fate. By rights, such a theatrical collage could come across as fragmentary, but he pulls it off brilliantly thanks to vivid writing, political nous and thematic unity. As is the nature of journeys, the passengers are in transition, changing jobs, beginning new lives, reinventing themselves, and yet already they seem stalked by death. They\u2019re like a congregation reflecting on the journey of life, with Dundee as heaven and the Tay as a watery purgatory. The journey is made smooth by Andrew Panton\u2019s excellent production, kicking off a double-anniversary season to mark 80 years of the theatre and 20 years of the permanent ensemble. With strong performances all around, the cast seem to haunt the broken carriage of designer Emily James\u2019s rotating set as it mutates into pubs, classrooms and tenements with dream-like fluidity. Simon Wilkinson\u2019s ominous lighting and MJ McCarthy\u2019s rib-shaking sound design build to the closing moments when the inevitable ending gives shape and force to Arnott\u2019s adventurous structure. \u2022 At Dundee Rep until 21 September.",

The stunning locations used in the hit BBC1 drama have boosted tourism across Cornwall.</p>\n    <p>Visit Cornwall reckons that 13% of visitors cite the show as one of the key reasons - or the only reason - for coming to the region, where tourism is worth about \u00a32bn annually.</p>\n    <p>Malcolm Bell, chief executive of Visit Cornwall, said recently that he believed the 'Poldark effect' will continue to draw in tourists despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/aug/26/poldark-final-episode-review-as-gloriously-hammy-and-cheesy-as-a-croque-monsieur\">the final season having finished</a>.</p>\n    <p>\u201cCornwall is often referred to as one of the stars of Poldark,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.cornwalllive.com/news/celebs-tv/poldark-effect-continue-cornwall-after-2888528\">he told Cornwall Live</a>. \u201cAll my colleagues around the UK are so envious that we have had such an amazing high-quality programme over the last few years. Most, if not all, would cut off their right arms to have the exposure that Cornwall has had across the world.\u201d</p>\n    <p>A generation earlier, the BBC\u2019s adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, which produced its own heart throb in Colin Firth\u2019s Mr Darcy, could be argued to have sparked the start of the modern \u201cscreen tourism\u201d phenomenon. Visitor numbers in parts of Cheshire that featured in the drama, notably Lyme Park in Disley, which served as Jane Austen\u2019s Pemberley, rose almost 200% after the series first aired in 1995.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>And Game of Thrones, which ran from 2011 until earlier this year, has drawn hundreds of thousands of tourists a year to Northern Ireland.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Creative England has estimated that \u201cscreen tourism\u201d is worth perhaps as much as \u00a3200m a year outside London.</p>\n    <p>The Netflix/Sony co-production The Crown has sparked a holiday boost to regions including the Peak District, Lake District and the Cotswolds. Similarly Wolf Hall, the six-part adaptation of Hilary Mantel\u2019s novels about Henry VIII and Thomas Cromwell, boosted tourism at Tudor palaces and museums across the country that were used as locations.</p>\n    <p>And 'set-jetters' flocked to Highclere castle in Hampshire after its appearance in Downton Abbey. The ITV drama, which gained a huge following in the US where it aired on PBS, is set to provide a new tourism boost with the eagerly-anticipated film due to debut later this month.</p>\n    <p>However, some regions of the UK have had too much of a good thing. Last year, 'over-tourism' from Poldark was said to be putting Cornwall's coastline at risk . Last year, tourism chiefs asked fans to <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/poldark-cornwall-beaches-overcrowding-kynance-cove-porthcurno-a8489356.html\">stay away from two beaches featured in the series</a>.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThe Peaky effect is really gaining momentum here, with tours and events in the West Midlands selling out months in advance,\u201d says Andy Street, the region\u2019s mayor. \u201cRecord numbers of tourists are now visiting the region, with many people wanting to explore the places and stories associated with the show.\u201d</p> \n<p>Birmingham\u2019s visitor numbers increased by 26% between 2013 \u2013 when the first season aired on the BBC \u2013 and 2018, according to new figures from the West Midlands Growth Company (WMGC).

      "bodyText": "For the historically large and diverse field of Democrats seeking the presidential nomination, it has been a long hot summer. But with the arrival of the Labor Day holiday comes a time-honored transition to a new and more volatile stage of the race. The field is narrowing, the competition growing more sharp. Former vice-president Joe Biden has held his early lead despite a season of missteps and gaffes. He is trailed by Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, who has staked out healthcare as his defining issue. But both have lost ground to Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, who spent her summer churning out policy plans, working selfie lines and steadily climbing the polls. Rounding out the top tier are the California senator Kamala Harris and South Bend\u2019s mayor, Pete Buttigieg, who used televised events to break through a congested field but have seen their progress stall. Party leaders and strategists say the race remains fluid at the top as the contenders prepare to share a debate stage in Houston in two weeks\u2019 time. \u201cThe stakes are higher now but the race is still open,\u201d said Tom Vilsack, secretary of agriculture under Barack Obama and former governor of Iowa. \u201cA spark or a moment during the debate could catapult one of them forward.\u201d Polling last week showed Biden held a comfortable lead at 32%, with Warren and Sanders jostling for second. A USA Today/Suffolk University survey found Warren at 14% and Sanders at 12%; Quinnipiac showed Warren at 19%, four points ahead of Sanders. In both polls, Harris and Buttigieg were the other candidates to top 5%. But as Barack Obama and Donald Trump showed in 2008 and 2016, early assumptions and public polling are not always good indicators of who voters will choose. Biden has an advantage among black voters but faces competition from Harris and the New Jersey senator Cory Booker, the most prominent African American contenders who have targeted his record on race. \u201cThe nightmare scenario for Joe Biden is that Kamala Harris or Cory Booker emerge very strong in the Iowa caucuses and that leads to an erosion of support among African Americans,\u201d said Bill Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. The biggest moment of Harris\u2019 campaign so far was the first debate, when she clashed with Biden. But she has faded since.

      "body": "<p>All potential solutions to the post-Brexit Irish border are fraught with difficulty and would leave smaller businesses struggling to cope, experts have said, as leaked government papers outline major concerns just two months before Britain is due to leave the EU.</p> <p>A report summarising the findings of the government\u2019s official \u201calternative arrangements\u201d working groups concluded that there are issues with all the scenarios put forward to try to replace the backstop arrangement. There are also specific concerns over whether any technological solution could be delivered to monitor cross-border trade.</p> <p>Critics said the paper, seen by the Guardian, should \u201cring alarm bells\u201d across government over how likely it is that alternative arrangements to the backstop will be found.</p> <p>The dossier marked \u201cofficial-sensitive\u201d prepared for the EU Exit Negotiations Board is dated 28 August. It details how the findings of all advisory groups informing the government on the Northern Irish border are being kept deliberately under wraps to try to avoid hampering Britain\u2019s intended renegotiation of the backstop agreed to by Theresa May.</p> <p>Alternative systems to avoid a hard Northern Irish border after Brexit have become the central tenet of Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit strategy. He sees this as a way of unlocking a new deal with Europe and has claimed that there are \u201cabundant solutions\u201d.</p> <p>However, the damning report shows there is no single deliverable solution at present, despite the fact Johnson is almost a third of the way through the \u201c30 days\u201d target that the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, gave him to come up with a fresh border proposal.</p> <p>The report said: \u201cIt is evident that every facilitation has concerns and issues related to them. The complexity of combining them into something more systemic and as part of one package is a key missing factor at present.\u201d</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s claim that a hard border could be avoided with mobile checks of livestock and crops was dismissed by experts as the most unlikely option to work. The report said: \u201cOverall there were a number of concerns surrounding the deliverability of technological facilitations.\u201d</p> <p>Questions were also raised over whether a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/sep/17/brussels-nearing-impasse-with-may-over-irish-border-proposal\">trusted trader scheme</a> \u2013 the current favourite for a border solution \u2013 would require infrastructure to set it up.</p> <p>MP Tom Brake, the Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman, said: \u201cAs we continue to get closer to 31 October, with Boris Johnson attempting to shut down our democracy, this leaked document rings alarm bells. It proves the government has no deliverable solution to the Irish border, let alone being able to find one within the next few weeks.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact that in this document there is not a single option that can be put forward to the EU as a viable alternative to the backstop, and that No 10 do not want to release these findings as they know Boris Johnson\u2019s bluff will be revealed, simply shows why MPs must come together to stop no deal.\u201d</p> <p>Naomi Smith, the chief executive of the Best for Britain group, which is \u201ccommitted to finding a democratic way to stop Brexit\u201d, said: \u201cIt is utterly shameful that the government has found no practical solution to the question of the Irish border, despite its insistence that the backstop be removed.</p> <p>\u201cRemoving the backstop without something to take its place would fundamentally undermine the Good Friday agreement, and the fragile peace process started just 20 years ago which it guards.</p> <p>\u201cDespite the prime minister shutting down parliament, MPs must do all they can to block a damaging and undemocratic no-deal Brexit, and the reimposition of a hard border in Northern Ireland.\u201d</p> <p>The official report summarises the work of two groups tasked with coming up with border ideas: advisory groups involving agricultural and food experts, customs and legal specialists and senior Northern Irish figures; and a Whitehall-based group which is due to shortly come up with a negotiating position on how to rework the withdrawal agreement to present to the EU.</p> <p>Border solutions the report deems as having the most potential are listed as:</p> <ul> <li><p>Regulatory and industry assurance schemes.</p></li> <li><p>Trusted trader schemes.</p></li> <li><p>Smarter risking (a technological solution that involves data sharing).</p></li> <li><p>A Northern Ireland sanitary and phytosanitary zone to track contamination and disease.</p></li> </ul> <p>There were significant concerns about an artificial intelligence option, which experts felt might not detect disease and chemical contamination of food.</p> <p>Onboard vehicle technology which could track the location, weight and temperature of goods was also considered risky if a lorry might suddenly be taken out of service and goods offloaded into a non-registered vehicle.</p> <p>Physical goods checks through mobile units could take weeks and involve lengthy periods of quarantine, the report found. The units could also be vulnerable to \u201ctargeting\u201d and staff could be at risk, it said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/01/sheer-scale-of-crisis-facing-britains-constitution-has-been-laid-bare\">The sheer scale of the crisis facing Britain\u2019s decrepit constitution has been laid bare | Will Hutton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Significantly, smaller businesses in Northern Ireland could suffer through the additional administration required to send and receive goods across the border, as well as other constraints and costs, the report found. They might also struggle with data collection or be unwilling to share information due to concerns around privacy.</p> <p>\u201cThis is because they do not have the existing systems in place and are more likely to have non-standardised products and product ranges,\u201d it said.</p> <p>On keeping the work around border solutions secret as the government prepares to go back to the EU to discuss the withdrawal agreement, the report said: \u201cDExEU [the Department for Exiting the European Union] has been considering whether a paper consolidating the findings from all of the advisory groups should be published in late September/early October.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, we and other departments have cautioned against this given the potential negative impacts on the renegotiation with the EU and we understand No 10 are in agreement \u2026\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for the DExEU said: \u201cWe don\u2019t comment on leaked documents.\u201d</p> <p>Over the weekend, the Republic of Ireland\u2019s minister for foreign affairs, Simon Coveney, said his country <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/01/ireland-says-it-will-not-act-for-boris-johnsons-political-convenience\">would not agree to drop the backstop merely for the \u201cpolitical convenience\u201d</a> of the British prime minister.</p> <p>In a forthright interview with the Sunday Business Post newspaper, he said: \u201cThere isn\u2019t a single EU member state putting pressure on Ireland to move away from that position, despite the fact that the UK has spoken to all of them and used all of the persuasion that they can muster to actually move countries away from that position.\u201d</p> <p>He said dropping the backstop would only create problems for Ireland further down the line. \u201cI\u2019m not going to pretend to people that we can do that for political convenience now to get a deal, and then find that Irish politics is dominated by the border issue indefinitely into the future.

      "bodyText": "All potential solutions to the post-Brexit Irish border are fraught with difficulty and would leave smaller businesses struggling to cope, experts have said, as leaked government papers outline major concerns just two months before Britain is due to leave the EU. A report summarising the findings of the government\u2019s official \u201calternative arrangements\u201d working groups concluded that there are issues with all the scenarios put forward to try to replace the backstop arrangement. There are also specific concerns over whether any technological solution could be delivered to monitor cross-border trade. Critics said the paper, seen by the Guardian, should \u201cring alarm bells\u201d across government over how likely it is that alternative arrangements to the backstop will be found. The dossier marked \u201cofficial-sensitive\u201d prepared for the EU Exit Negotiations Board is dated 28 August. It details how the findings of all advisory groups informing the government on the Northern Irish border are being kept deliberately under wraps to try to avoid hampering Britain\u2019s intended renegotiation of the backstop agreed to by Theresa May. Alternative systems to avoid a hard Northern Irish border after Brexit have become the central tenet of Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit strategy. He sees this as a way of unlocking a new deal with Europe and has claimed that there are \u201cabundant solutions\u201d. However, the damning report shows there is no single deliverable solution at present, despite the fact Johnson is almost a third of the way through the \u201c30 days\u201d target that the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, gave him to come up with a fresh border proposal. The report said: \u201cIt is evident that every facilitation has concerns and issues related to them. The complexity of combining them into something more systemic and as part of one package is a key missing factor at present.\u201d Johnson\u2019s claim that a hard border could be avoided with mobile checks of livestock and crops was dismissed by experts as the most unlikely option to work. The report said: \u201cOverall there were a number of concerns surrounding the deliverability of technological facilitations.\u201d Questions were also raised over whether a trusted trader scheme \u2013 the current favourite for a border solution \u2013 would require infrastructure to set it up. MP Tom Brake, the Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman, said: \u201cAs we continue to get closer to 31 October, with Boris Johnson attempting to shut down our democracy, this leaked document rings alarm bells. It proves the government has no deliverable solution to the Irish border, let alone being able to find one within the next few weeks. \u201cThe fact that in this document there is not a single option that can be put forward to the EU as a viable alternative to the backstop, and that No 10 do not want to release these findings as they know Boris Johnson\u2019s bluff will be revealed, simply shows why MPs must come together to stop no deal.\u201d Naomi Smith, the chief executive of the Best for Britain group, which is \u201ccommitted to finding a democratic way to stop Brexit\u201d, said: \u201cIt is utterly shameful that the government has found no practical solution to the question of the Irish border, despite its insistence that the backstop be removed. \u201cRemoving the backstop without something to take its place would fundamentally undermine the Good Friday agreement, and the fragile peace process started just 20 years ago which it guards. \u201cDespite the prime minister shutting down parliament, MPs must do all they can to block a damaging and undemocratic no-deal Brexit, and the reimposition of a hard border in Northern Ireland.\u201d The official report summarises the work of two groups tasked with coming up with border ideas: advisory groups involving agricultural and food experts, customs and legal specialists and senior Northern Irish figures; and a Whitehall-based group which is due to shortly come up with a negotiating position on how to rework the withdrawal agreement to present to the EU. Border solutions the report deems as having the most potential are listed as: Regulatory and industry assurance schemes. Trusted trader schemes. Smarter risking (a technological solution that involves data sharing). A Northern Ireland sanitary and phytosanitary zone to track contamination and disease. There were significant concerns about an artificial intelligence option, which experts felt might not detect disease and chemical contamination of food. Onboard vehicle technology which could track the location, weight and temperature of goods was also considered risky if a lorry might suddenly be taken out of service and goods offloaded into a non-registered vehicle. Physical goods checks through mobile units could take weeks and involve lengthy periods of quarantine, the report found. The units could also be vulnerable to \u201ctargeting\u201d and staff could be at risk, it said. Significantly, smaller businesses in Northern Ireland could suffer through the additional administration required to send and receive goods across the border, as well as other constraints and costs, the report found. They might also struggle with data collection or be unwilling to share information due to concerns around privacy. \u201cThis is because they do not have the existing systems in place and are more likely to have non-standardised products and product ranges,\u201d it said. On keeping the work around border solutions secret as the government prepares to go back to the EU to discuss the withdrawal agreement, the report said: \u201cDExEU [the Department for Exiting the European Union] has been considering whether a paper consolidating the findings from all of the advisory groups should be published in late September/early October. \u201cHowever, we and other departments have cautioned against this given the potential negative impacts on the renegotiation with the EU and we understand No 10 are in agreement \u2026\u201d A spokesperson for the DExEU said: \u201cWe don\u2019t comment on leaked documents.\u201d Over the weekend, the Republic of Ireland\u2019s minister for foreign affairs, Simon Coveney, said his country would not agree to drop the backstop merely for the \u201cpolitical convenience\u201d of the British prime minister. In a forthright interview with the Sunday Business Post newspaper, he said: \u201cThere isn\u2019t a single EU member state putting pressure on Ireland to move away from that position, despite the fact that the UK has spoken to all of them and used all of the persuasion that they can muster to actually move countries away from that position.\u201d He said dropping the backstop would only create problems for Ireland further down the line. \u201cI\u2019m not going to pretend to people that we can do that for political convenience now to get a deal, and then find that Irish politics is dominated by the border issue indefinitely into the future. We\u2019re not doing that,\u201d he said.",

Claiming to be the product of \u201cthe largest research project of its kind\u201d, the designs have done away with Victorian-style gallery cell blocks, removed the bars from windows, and arranged the cells in smaller groups around landscaped courtyards.

The practice was commissioned in 2016 to come up with a standardised design that could be rolled out in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2015/nov/10/super-prisons-michael-gove-1bn-government-plan\">a \u00a31.2bn programme of super-prisons</a> \u2013 a pre-existing plan that the new prime minister has merely re-announced. \u201cThe idea was to put loads of time and effort into understanding the optimum design of a house block,\u201d he adds. \u201cIf you\u2019re building 10,000 cells, it\u2019s worth spending ages getting the cell absolutely right.\u201d It was supposed to be the ultimate flat-pack kit for incarceration by numbers, fine-tuned for efficiency and cost-effectiveness.<br><br>Using virtual reality modelling, the architects tested countless layouts with prison staff, tweaking corridor widths and lengths, adjusting ceiling heights and modelling acoustics to come up with a layout that struck a balance between prisoner rehabilitation and operational efficiency \u2013 the two chief parameters of prison design, usually diametrically opposed, with the latter generally coming out on top.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"267259527357b5cd8841fc5055ed3f603a95de2c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/267259527357b5cd8841fc5055ed3f603a95de2c/998_0_3584_4480/800.jpg\" alt=\"Panopticon hangover \u2026 the K-Block design of HMP Wakefield.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Panopticon hangover \u2026 the K-Block design of HMP Wakefield.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: A.P.S. (UK)/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The most radical changes in the resulting Wellingborough plan include getting rid of the familiar two-storey atrium arrangement with galleried landings \u2013 loved by prison officers for the visibility they allow between floors, but which result in hellish echo chambers \u2013 and ditching the usual K-shaped formation of the housing blocks.</p> <p>The K-block, instantly recognisable as a prison from the air, has lingered for generations as a hangover from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/23/panopticon-digital-surveillance-jeremy-bentham\">the panopticon ideal</a>, developed by 18th-century reformer Jeremy Bentham. In theory, a single prison officer placed in the centre of the radial arms of corridors could \u201csurvey of the whole establishment in the twinkling of an eye\u201d, while imparting in the prisoners a crushing sense of constant surveillance. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/aug/22/pentonville-prison-overcrowded-and-drug-use-rife-says-watchdog\">Pentonville prison</a>, which opened in London in 1842, set the standard with radial wings, galleried landings and all-pervasive grimness. Even contemporary commentators described it as \u201cunnecessarily cruel\u201d and posited that \u201cmadness will seize those whom death has spared\u201d. Yet, over the following six years, 54 prisons were built to exactly the same template, from Preston to Leeds and Manchester, and the same basic principles have remained unchanged in modern super-prisons.<br><br>Bryden Wood\u2019s housing blocks attempt to be a little more humane. Their staggered cross-shaped form breaks up the corridors into smaller, more social zones, where prison staff might be able to develop better relationships with prisoners through more direct contact and conversation, rather than the usual physical separation and anonymity of miles of corridors. The perpendicular wings create usable outdoor space for sports and gardening, rather than awkward triangles left over in the armpits of a K-block, while a central hub will provide education, vocational training and social facilities in one place, \u201clike a high street\u201d, says Johnston \u2013 rather than scattering the facilities across the sprawling campus.<br><br>These details aside, however, it looks very much like business as usual: endless warehouse-like sheds punctuated by tiny square windows, forming an institutional assembly line for inmates to be processed like Amazon parcels. The design of the cells remains confidential, while a source close to the project says there has been significant \u201cvalue engineering\u201d, including the removal of the acoustic treatment. (An MoJ spokeswoman said: \u201cWe have worked closely with [contractor] Kier over the design at HMP Wellingborough, making improvements to each area of the prison at a price that is affordable for the taxpayer.\u201d) While the whole scheme was specifically designed for off-site prefabrication and repeatable economies of scale, it is instead being built with conventional construction methods, and will likely remain a one-off.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b5b3100e1102af9587c736e083960990d2abae8e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5b3100e1102af9587c736e083960990d2abae8e/0_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Akin to an Ikea cafe\u2019 \u2026 CGIs of the proposed HMP Wellingborough visitor centre.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Akin to an Ikea cafe\u2019 \u2026 CGI of the proposed HMP Wellingborough visitor centre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Bryden Wood</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Architect Roland Karthaus, whose <a href=\"https://www.matterarchitecture.uk/research/wellbeing-in-prisons/\">in-depth research on prison design</a> won a RIBA award last year, points to procurement as the biggest obstacle in realising decent, humane prisons. \u201cIn the past, a brief has been developed, then sent out to contractors, who appear to value engineer it to death,\u201d he says. \u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be any process of actually valuing what the impact of those changes might be.\u201d He says the low cell ceilings in HMP Berwyn were a result of cost-cutting, without due concern for the psychological impact of squeezing the prisoners\u2019 personal space. Karthaus also found that the layout of furniture in Berwyn\u2019s cells meant it was impossible to do press-ups on the floor, while the way the ventilation grilles had been fitted essentially made them redundant.<br><br>The failure of the modern prison estate is all the more galling given the extensive wealth of knowledge that exists in academia and practice about how to design environments that are actually conductive to rehabilitation. Johnston says his team constantly showed their client world-leading examples, such as Norway\u2019s celebrated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/may/18/halden-most-humane-prison-in-world\">Halden prison</a> \u2013 where inmates are trusted with kitchens equipped with knives to cook their dinner, and there\u2019s a little house on the campus where prisoners can stay with their families for a night \u2013 but that such features would require a fundamental shift in how we think about incarceration in this country.<br><br>\u201cThe Scandinavian mindset is that if someone is in prison, that\u2019s our fault as a society,\u201d he says. \u201cWe let you fall through the cracks, so it\u2019s our responsibility to rehabilitate you.\u201d Bryden Wood\u2019s design process, by contrast, was haunted by the spectre of the Daily Mail test, forever mindful of \u201cHoliday camps for prisoners!\u201d headlines if their plans were deemed too cushy. Prisons in England must not only punish, but be seen to punish, with politicians constantly citing public opinion to justify draconian measures.<br><br>So are we stuck with a template that remains basically unchanged since the publication of Hints for the Improvements of Prisons in 1817, which prescribed that the buildings should be \u201cmade as gloomy and melancholy as possible\u201d?<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a4a8b148486c65fb57094030cdf6516bbfc76672\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4a8b148486c65fb57094030cdf6516bbfc76672/14_200_5582_3349/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Environments that are actually conductive to rehabilitation\u2019 \u2026 Halden prison in Norway.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Environments that are actually conductive to rehabilitation\u2019 \u2026 Halden prison in Norway.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Trond Isaksen/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to Yvonne Jewkes, one of the UK\u2019s leading prison academics, we shouldn\u2019t be surprised that history continues to repeat itself, given the \u201cpervasive cautiousness perpetuated by an intricate network of individuals, companies and capital, and driven primarily by concerns for security, cost and efficiency.\u201d She points to the privatisation of both the construction and management of prisons in the 1990s as enshrining short-term cost-saving over long-term benefit. But she sees signs of hope in Scotland\u2019s prison programme, where three new prisons built since 2012 \u2013 HMP Low Moss, HMP Shotts and HMP Grampian \u2013 show a \u201cnod to Scandinavia\u201d in their more open, community-facing designs. Karthaus says the key to Scotland\u2019s success is the smaller scale of the operation: all the decision-makers can sit in a room and agree on the design, something that is currently impossible in England\u2019s bloated super-prison system.<br><br>Just as building more roads brings more traffic, history has shown that if you build more prisons, the prison population will only increase. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/24/england-and-wales-jail-shameful-numbers-of-people-says-report\">recent report by the Prison Reform Trust</a> described an \u201caddiction to imprisonment\u201d, and found that the number of people behind bars in England and Wales is nearly 70% higher than three decades ago. If Boris Johnson has any intention of reducing reoffending \u2013 which currently costs the taxpayer around \u00a315bn a year \u2013 he should focus on reducing the number of prison places, and prioritise rehabilitation over packing as many people as possible into ever more damaging containers.</p>",

It is against this bleak backdrop that the Ministry of Justice has allowed architects Bryden Wood to promote their plans for HMP Wellingborough, a \u00a3253m 1,600-capacity prison currently under construction in Northamptonshire. Claiming to be the product of \u201cthe largest research project of its kind\u201d, the designs have done away with Victorian-style gallery cell blocks, removed the bars from windows, and arranged the cells in smaller groups around landscaped courtyards. The visitor centre promises to be an airy timber-lined hall more akin to an Ikea cafe. \u201cWe really started from first principles,\u201d says Jaimie Johnston, director of Bryden Wood. The practice was commissioned in 2016 to come up with a standardised design that could be rolled out in a \u00a31.2bn programme of super-prisons \u2013 a pre-existing plan that the new prime minister has merely re-announced. \u201cThe idea was to put loads of time and effort into understanding the optimum design of a house block,\u201d he adds. \u201cIf you\u2019re building 10,000 cells, it\u2019s worth spending ages getting the cell absolutely right.\u201d It was supposed to be the ultimate flat-pack kit for incarceration by numbers, fine-tuned for efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Using virtual reality modelling, the architects tested countless layouts with prison staff, tweaking corridor widths and lengths, adjusting ceiling heights and modelling acoustics to come up with a layout that struck a balance between prisoner rehabilitation and operational efficiency \u2013 the two chief parameters of prison design, usually diametrically opposed, with the latter generally coming out on top. The most radical changes in the resulting Wellingborough plan include getting rid of the familiar two-storey atrium arrangement with galleried landings \u2013 loved by prison officers for the visibility they allow between floors, but which result in hellish echo chambers \u2013 and ditching the usual K-shaped formation of the housing blocks. The K-block, instantly recognisable as a prison from the air, has lingered for generations as a hangover from the panopticon ideal, developed by 18th-century reformer Jeremy Bentham. In theory, a single prison officer placed in the centre of the radial arms of corridors could \u201csurvey of the whole establishment in the twinkling of an eye\u201d, while imparting in the prisoners a crushing sense of constant surveillance. Pentonville prison, which opened in London in 1842, set the standard with radial wings, galleried landings and all-pervasive grimness. Even contemporary commentators described it as \u201cunnecessarily cruel\u201d and posited that \u201cmadness will seize those whom death has spared\u201d. Yet, over the following six years, 54 prisons were built to exactly the same template, from Preston to Leeds and Manchester, and the same basic principles have remained unchanged in modern super-prisons. Bryden Wood\u2019s housing blocks attempt to be a little more humane. Their staggered cross-shaped form breaks up the corridors into smaller, more social zones, where prison staff might be able to develop better relationships with prisoners through more direct contact and conversation, rather than the usual physical separation and anonymity of miles of corridors. The perpendicular wings create usable outdoor space for sports and gardening, rather than awkward triangles left over in the armpits of a K-block, while a central hub will provide education, vocational training and social facilities in one place, \u201clike a high street\u201d, says Johnston \u2013 rather than scattering the facilities across the sprawling campus. These details aside, however, it looks very much like business as usual: endless warehouse-like sheds punctuated by tiny square windows, forming an institutional assembly line for inmates to be processed like Amazon parcels. The design of the cells remains confidential, while a source close to the project says there has been significant \u201cvalue engineering\u201d, including the removal of the acoustic treatment. (An MoJ spokeswoman said: \u201cWe have worked closely with [contractor] Kier over the design at HMP Wellingborough, making improvements to each area of the prison at a price that is affordable for the taxpayer.\u201d) While the whole scheme was specifically designed for off-site prefabrication and repeatable economies of scale, it is instead being built with conventional construction methods, and will likely remain a one-off. Architect Roland Karthaus, whose in-depth research on prison design won a RIBA award last year, points to procurement as the biggest obstacle in realising decent, humane prisons. \u201cIn the past, a brief has been developed, then sent out to contractors, who appear to value engineer it to death,\u201d he says. \u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be any process of actually valuing what the impact of those changes might be.\u201d He says the low cell ceilings in HMP Berwyn were a result of cost-cutting, without due concern for the psychological impact of squeezing the prisoners\u2019 personal space. Karthaus also found that the layout of furniture in Berwyn\u2019s cells meant it was impossible to do press-ups on the floor, while the way the ventilation grilles had been fitted essentially made them redundant. The failure of the modern prison estate is all the more galling given the extensive wealth of knowledge that exists in academia and practice about how to design environments that are actually conductive to rehabilitation. Johnston says his team constantly showed their client world-leading examples, such as Norway\u2019s celebrated Halden prison \u2013 where inmates are trusted with kitchens equipped with knives to cook their dinner, and there\u2019s a little house on the campus where prisoners can stay with their families for a night \u2013 but that such features would require a fundamental shift in how we think about incarceration in this country. \u201cThe Scandinavian mindset is that if someone is in prison, that\u2019s our fault as a society,\u201d he says. \u201cWe let you fall through the cracks, so it\u2019s our responsibility to rehabilitate you.\u201d Bryden Wood\u2019s design process, by contrast, was haunted by the spectre of the Daily Mail test, forever mindful of \u201cHoliday camps for prisoners!\u201d headlines if their plans were deemed too cushy. Prisons in England must not only punish, but be seen to punish, with politicians constantly citing public opinion to justify draconian measures. So are we stuck with a template that remains basically unchanged since the publication of Hints for the Improvements of Prisons in 1817, which prescribed that the buildings should be \u201cmade as gloomy and melancholy as possible\u201d? According to Yvonne Jewkes, one of the UK\u2019s leading prison academics, we shouldn\u2019t be surprised that history continues to repeat itself, given the \u201cpervasive cautiousness perpetuated by an intricate network of individuals, companies and capital, and driven primarily by concerns for security, cost and efficiency.\u201d She points to the privatisation of both the construction and management of prisons in the 1990s as enshrining short-term cost-saving over long-term benefit. But she sees signs of hope in Scotland\u2019s prison programme, where three new prisons built since 2012 \u2013 HMP Low Moss, HMP Shotts and HMP Grampian \u2013 show a \u201cnod to Scandinavia\u201d in their more open, community-facing designs. Karthaus says the key to Scotland\u2019s success is the smaller scale of the operation: all the decision-makers can sit in a room and agree on the design, something that is currently impossible in England\u2019s bloated super-prison system. Just as building more roads brings more traffic, history has shown that if you build more prisons, the prison population will only increase. A recent report by the Prison Reform Trust described an \u201caddiction to imprisonment\u201d, and found that the number of people behind bars in England and Wales is nearly 70% higher than three decades ago. If Boris Johnson has any intention of reducing reoffending \u2013 which currently costs the taxpayer around \u00a315bn a year \u2013 he should focus on reducing the number of prison places, and prioritise rehabilitation over packing as many people as possible into ever more damaging containers.",

Farther out, the blue-white haze of a sea fret softens the angularity of the vast Blyth wind turbines. I\u2019m standing in the shadow of an older piece of maritime architecture: the salt-washed white column of St Mary\u2019s lighthouse, circled by fulmars, the blue sky above swept at intervals by huge flocks of golden plovers. I lean on a railing and watch the grey seals. I count about a dozen on the rocks and another four or five bobbing in the sea, each grey head as glossy as a wet pebble. Fewer than there ought to be. St Mary\u2019s is a tidal island, linked to the mainland by a causeway that is subsumed by the North Sea each high tide. Its uneven skirts of rock offer hauling-out spots \u2013 places to moult or rest up, to lounge, as these are doing, in the morning sun \u2013 for the grey seals that breed at Coquet and the Farne Islands. Polite notices propped on the rocks ask visitors \u2013 birdwatchers, rockpoolers, photographers, country diarists \u2013 to keep away from the seals. Still, the best views are to be had from up by the lighthouse (and with no danger of slipping on a damp hank of egg wrack underfoot). But the seals still get pestered \u2013 not least, in the holidays of high summer, from the ocean side of the island, by unwitting kayakers, canoeists and paddleboarders. It\u2019s recommended that seals be given at least 50 metres of room. It doesn\u2019t sound much to ask. I watch as one pale seal pulls itself into a fat banana-shape and sploshes sideways into the shallows. Curlews whinny from the rockpools behind me. Something small and streaked \u2013 a twite? \u2013 zips across the limpet-studded stone. A pair of greater black-backed gulls, officer-thugs, thick-necked in crisp whites and greys, come thumping through the air, not far above the wave tops. I think of them again later when, just this side of dusk, by the mainland end of the causeway, we see a short-eared owl hovering over the long grass. Its pounding wings whump the air like carpet-beaters. \u2022 The caption to the main photograph was amended on 3 September 2019.",

      "bodyText": "In Avalanche: A Love Story, Julia Leigh\u2019s 2016 memoir about the struggles to conceive using IVF, the author writes: \u201cBut what if my period hadn\u2019t arrived? What if the test had been positive? My whole life would have changed. Just like that.\u201d And yet her life doesn\u2019t change, at least not in the way she wants. By the end of the book Sydney-based Leigh had undergone no less than six rounds of IVF. At times, she got close to having a much-wanted child. But as she put it: a near miss is still a miss. At one point her sister \u2013 a mother of two \u2013 takes her aside. \u201cYou need to find another way to be happy,\u201d she tells her. Leigh has since turned her memoir into a play of the same name. Avalanche: A Love Story, a co-production between Sydney Theatre Company and the UK\u2019s Barbican Theatre, premiered in London earlier this year at the Fertility Fest, which pegs itself as the world\u2019s first arts festival dedicated to reproductive science. As in the UK, the Sydney leg stars accomplished English TV actor Maxine Peake, of Shameless and Dinnerladies fame. Alone on stage, she performs a one-woman monologue. With brutality and honesty, she regales her character\u2019s journey: from falling in love in her late 30s, to marriage, to the joint decision to have a child, to divorce, and then, finally, the resolution to forge ahead and become a single parent. Most narratives about hardship end in triumph of some sort. But Avalanche reeks of unhappiness and an accumulating sense of dread. It is painful. Raw. Exhausting. Resentful. Even the jokes \u2013 and there are many jokes \u2013 are bitter. It\u2019s lucky, then, that Peake has the talent, as well as the experience, to navigate such source material. Peake, 45, has been open in interviews about her own attempts at IVF and her ambivalence about motherhood (she went through three rounds before deciding to stop). In Avalanche, she so wholly embodies Leigh\u2019s character of Woman that it is hard to believe she isn\u2019t telling her own story up there, solitary and vulnerable.

The government in Jakarta maintains Papua and West Papua are integral and indivisible parts of the state of Indonesia: this position has the support of major powers in the region and around the world. Known as Irian Jaya until 2000, it was split into two provinces, Papua and West Papua, in 2003. They have semi-autonomous status. The provinces have suffered from systemic underdevelopment but they are rich with natural resources, including gold, copper, and timber and generate billions of dollars for Indonesia.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why is independence a big issue?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Political control of the region has been contested for more than half a century and Indonesia has consistently been accused of human rights violations and violent suppression of the region\u2019s independence movement. The people indigenous to the province are Melanesian, ethnically distinct from most of the rest of Indonesia and more closely linked to the people of Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Fiji and New Caledonia.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>So how did it become part of Indonesia?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Formerly the Netherlands New Guinea, Papua was retained by the Dutch after Indonesian independence in 1945 but the province was annexed by Jakarta in 1963. Indonesia formalised its control over West Papua in 1969 when its military hand-picked 1,025 of West Papua\u2019s population and compelled them into publicly voting in favour of the takeover under a UN-supervised, but undemocratic, process known as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/29/west-papua-independence-history\">Act of Free Choice</a>. The British and Foreign Commonwealth Office reported at the time \u201cthe process of consultation did not allow a genuinely free choice to be made\u201d, while the US embassy reported it was \u201cunfolding like a Greek tragedy, the conclusion pre-ordained\u201d.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How much support does the independence movement have?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Many Papuans regard the Indonesian takeover as an illegal annexation. In 2017, an illegal petition calling for a free vote on independence, signed by 1.8 million people (about 70% of the Papuan population) and secretly carried around the provinces, was presented to the UN\u2019s decolonisation committee, and the human rights commissioner.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is there an armed struggle?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Free Papua Movement has led a low-level insurgency for decades. That insurgency has long been the rationale for significant Indonesian military involvement in Papua. With the heightened police and military presence, there have been reports of security force abuses including extrajudicial killings, torture, arbitrary detention, excessive use of force and mistreatment of peaceful protesters. Dozens of Papuans remain behind bars for peaceful demonstration or expressing solidarity with the independence movement. West Papuan sources have claimed white phosphorous, a banned chemical weapon, has been used to attack civilians, though this has not been categorically proven. This claim has been strenuously denied by Indonesia.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is there any outside support for independence?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There has always been concern about the annexation of the region. A <a href=\"https://www.law.yale.edu/system/files/documents/pdf/Intellectual_Life/West_Papua_final_report.pdf\">report in 2004 by the International Human Rights Clinic at Yale Law School</a> said Indonesian military leaders \u201cbegan making public threats against Papuan leaders \u2026 vowing to shoot them on the spot if they did not vote for Indonesian control\u201d. In May 2019, the then UK government\u2019s minister for Asia and the Pacific, Mark Field, described the Act of Free Choice as an \u201cutterly flawed process\u201d, but said there was no appetite in the international community to revisit the question of the legitimacy of Indonesia\u2019s control. The Free West Papua movement has strong support from Melanesian neighbours, in particular Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands, but regional powers, such as Australia, support Indonesian control of the province.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThe crowd shot arrows and threw rocks at security personnel in front of the Deiyai regent\u2019s office and there were even sounds of gunfire from the direction of the crowd, leading security personnel to shoot at the attackers,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Demonstrations have broken out across Papua and West Papua, often descending into violence after being opposed by security forces and vigilante groups. Because of an internet shutdown across the remote provinces, information on clashes is emerging slowly, and is hard to verify.</p> \n<p>Footage from Fakfak on the south-west coast of Papua on 21 August has also emerged, showing armed militia, some carrying Indonesian flags, clashing with Papuan protesters.

Our enemy is only the system of colonisation. We will not be provoked. Our peaceful struggle is for a referendum.\u201d</p> \n<p>Dame Meg Taylor, the secretary general of the Pacific Islands Forum, said she was deeply concerned by the escalating violence, and called for calm and restraint from all parties. She said the \u201croot causes of the conflict\u201d must be addressed by peaceful means. \u201cThese events make the proposed visit of the UN high commissioner for human rights to West Papua even more important.\u201d</p> \n<p><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Three West Papuan students have reportedly been shot in their dormitories by militia groups amid growing tensions in the region, as disturbing footage emerged of Indonesian soldiers firing on peaceful demonstrators during clashes last week in which protesters say six died. The Papuan students were attacked in a dormitory in Abepura district, Jayapura, by police-backed armed militias on Sunday. One student was killed by a bullet wound to the chest. The students were reportedly attacked as they tried to defend themselves from vigilantes from a pro-Jakarta group calling itself Masyarakat Nusantara (Archipelago Community). Papuan protesters allege non-Papuan vigilante groups are being encouraged by police and military to attack Papuans during what has been more than a fortnight of protests over racial discrimination and abuse as well as calls for independence from Indonesia. Despite an internet blackout across Papua and West Papua, footage has emerged showing soldiers firing at a crowd of demonstrators outside a government office in Deiyai last week: some of the demonstrators are standing with their hands in the air, as soldiers move in. Protesters say six people were killed in the confrontation, and more than a dozen injured, after a police opened fire on a peaceful demonstration that had occupied the regent\u2019s office in the middle of Deiyai city. Victor Yeimo from the West Papua National Committee said: \u201cThey [went] inside peacefully, but suddenly, without any provocation police opened fire into the mass of demonstrators. Then \u2026 people attacked with bow and arrow.\u201d Photos have emerged of the body of one Indonesian soldier killed in the clash last Wednesday, his body pierced with arrows. Papua police spokesperson Commander Anton Ampang has disputed the death count, saying one protester was killed, and that security forces opened fire only after being attacked. \u201cAround 1,000 people armed with arrows, spears and machetes joined the protesters and started to dance the Waita dance [a traditional war dance] and threw rocks at the security forces,\u201d Anton said in a statement. Military personnel in a car were attacked, he said. \u201cThe crowd shot arrows and threw rocks at security personnel in front of the Deiyai regent\u2019s office and there were even sounds of gunfire from the direction of the crowd, leading security personnel to shoot at the attackers,\u201d he said. Demonstrations have broken out across Papua and West Papua, often descending into violence after being opposed by security forces and vigilante groups. Because of an internet shutdown across the remote provinces, information on clashes is emerging slowly, and is hard to verify. Footage from Fakfak on the south-west coast of Papua on 21 August has also emerged, showing armed militia, some carrying Indonesian flags, clashing with Papuan protesters. Police and military personnel move among the pro-Jakarta militia, and gunshots can be heard. Alfa Isnaeni of the nationalist Banser militia, the paramilitary wing of Indonesia\u2019s largest independent Islamic organisation Nahdlatul Ulama, said 2,000 members were conducting \u201ccombing out\u201d operations, seeking information on anti-Indonesia groups, but said militia members were prepared to conduct security operations if requested. \u201cIf the TNI [Indonesian military] commander or the defence minister asks us, the only thing we can say is that we\u2019re ready,\u201d Isnaeni said. And in Jayapura, a lone protester scaled a giant flagpole to tear down the Indonesian national flag, replacing it with the Morning Star flag on West Papua, an act that carries a potential 15-year jail term. Police have responded to weeks of demonstrations by banning \u201canarchist\u201d demonstration, and arresting dozens on Papuans accused of rioting in the region\u2019s capital. \u201cEveryone is forbidden from carrying out demonstrations and conveying opinions in public that could give rise to anarchist acts, damage, and burning of public facilities,\u201d a six-point police order said. Indonesia earlier said it would deploy about 2,500 more police and troops to Papua, adding to about 1,200 personnel it had already sent after unrest first broke out. The mineral-rich but under-developed and impoverished region of Papua has been the scene of a low-level insurgency against Indonesia\u2019s rule for decades. But protests marking the August anniversaries of the New York Agreement and the Act of Free Choice - the political acts which formalised Indonesian control of Papua - have been further sparked by racist bullying of Papuan students in Java, and police reprisals against them for demonstrating. The exiled leader of the United Movement for the Liberation of West Papua Benny Wenda said the independence movement was peaceful and that a free and fair referendum was the only solution to the long-running contestation of the region. \u201cAs Indonesia deliberately tries to create ethnic conflict in West Papua with militia, I must stress that for West Papuans our enemy is not the Indonesian people. Our enemy is only the system of colonisation. We will not be provoked. Our peaceful struggle is for a referendum.\u201d Dame Meg Taylor, the secretary general of the Pacific Islands Forum, said she was deeply concerned by the escalating violence, and called for calm and restraint from all parties. She said the \u201croot causes of the conflict\u201d must be addressed by peaceful means. \u201cThese events make the proposed visit of the UN high commissioner for human rights to West Papua even more important.\u201d",

Wong was again repeatedly accused of lying and \u201cmaking all this up as you go along\u201d as he continued his evidence to the Independent Commission Against Corruption on Monday. The commission is investigating whether Huang Xiangmo, a Chinese billionaire and property developer, funnelled $100,000 in cash to NSW Labor in breach of state laws barring property developer donations. Icac has been particularly focused on a Chinese Friends of Labor fundraising dinner held shortly before the 2015 state election, and previous evidence claimed a series of straw donors, or fake donors, may have been used to mask the origins of Huang\u2019s money. It is alleged that Wong helped procure false donation records following the 2015 dinner. The commission heard Wong had met with two key witnesses after the anti-corruption investigation began in January last year. That included a meeting in his parliament office with Steve Tong, one of the alleged straw donors, who was angry that his name had been falsely used on records purporting to show a $5,000 donation to Labor. Visitor records show Wong met with Tong in September 2018. \u201cHe did say that he was not the actual one who paid that particular donation,\u201d Wong said. Counsel assisting, Scott Robertson, accused Wong of using the meeting to tell Tong to \u201ckeep his mouth shut\u201d.

Internal emails show Wong asking an acquaintance \u2013 Quanbao \u201cLeo\u201d Liao, a senior figure at property development firm Wu International \u2013 to send him two signed donation disclosure forms after the fundraising dinner. Wong attached a partially pre-filled disclosure form in his email to Liao, which had been scanned at his parliamentary office. It listed a donation amount of $5,000, just below the legal maximum, and struck out all possible payment options aside from cash. An email was returned to him with signed donation declarations from Tong, a Wu International worker, and Liao.

      "bodyText": "The prime minister says he cannot \u201cin good conscience\u201d allow a Tamil couple and their Australian-born children facing deportation to stay in Australia, saying any softening of the government\u2019s hardline boats policy would be exploited by people smugglers. Despite public rallies over the weekend in support of the family and calls from Labor to show \u201ccompassion\u201d in the case, Scott Morrison said he would not be granting an exception. \u201cThat\u2019s not how you run strong borders,\u201d he said. \u201cI do understand the real feeling about this and the desire for there to be an exception but I know what the consequences are of allowing those exceptions. \u201cI know what happens when you send those messages back into those communities, whether it\u2019s in Sri Lanka or the more than 10,000 people sitting in Indonesia right now who would get on a boat tomorrow if they thought this government was changing its position.\u201d When asked if his government was out of step with the public mood, Morrison said: \u201cIt\u2019s not about the public mood, it\u2019s about what is the right decision in Australia\u2019s national interests to ensure that the integrity of our border protection regime is maintained.\u201d The prime minister also encouraged the family to apply to come to Australia once they were retuned to Sri Lanka using \u201cthe same processes as everyone else anywhere else in the world\u201d. \u201cI would hope they do, but they didn\u2019t come to the country in the appropriate way, they have not been found to have an asylum claim, and to change our policy on this or to exercise intervention powers on this would be to send exactly the wrong message to those who are looking to sell tickets to vulnerable people looking to get on boats,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would send them the exact wrong message and that\u2019s not something that I, in good conscience, can allow to happen.\u201d Morrison who, when immigration minister in the Abbott government, repeatedly refused to discuss \u201con-water matters\u201d, defended the Coalition\u2019s decision to publicise information about recent Sri Lankan boat interceptions in the Australian newspaper on Monday. \u201cThe government releases information as it believes it\u2019s important to do so. We followed a practice that we have in the past and I think that keeps the issue of the ever-present threat of illegal arrivals to Australia foremost in the public\u2019s mind.\u201d Morrison\u2019s comments come after Peter Dutton hit back at refugee advocates and \u201cLabor opportunists\u201d for trying to prevent the deportation of a Tamil couple and their Australian-born children to Sri Lanka, saying they are not refugees. Arguing that there are 68 million displaced people who have a more \u201ccompelling\u201d case to be resettled in Australia than the family who settled in Biloela, the home affairs minister used an opinion piece in the Courier-Mail on Monday to stress that the government needed to make \u201ctough decisions\u201d. \u201cThe case of the family from Sri Lanka is also a complex case and has attracted a lot of media attention with many false claims by refugee advocates and Labor opportunists,\u201d he said. \u201cLabor initially put them into detention and they were told all those years ago that, on the details they provided, they were not refugees under the UN definition so they would have to go home. \u201cThey were told that they would never settle permanently in Australia, just like many others who arrived by boat. They never accepted that decision.\u201d Dutton\u2019s intervention comes as lawyers make a last-ditch effort in the federal circuit court to prevent the deportation of the family who are now being held in detention on Christmas Island. An interim injunction blocking the deportation of Priya, her husband, Nadesalingam, and their children Kopika, four, and Tharunicaa, two, has been extended until Wednesday. Lawyers acting for the family in the federal circuit court today were successful in having the two cases for the family combined ahead of the federal court hearing on Wednesday. The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, and the home affairs secretary, Mike Pezzullo, have also been added to the case. Carina Ford, and immigration lawyer who is leading the case for the family, told journalists outside court even if the family wins on Wednesday, it will still require Dutton to have a \u201cchange of heart\u201d when he considers the application for a visa for Tharunicaa. \u201cThat\u2019s the battle we have. Ultimately, we need a change of heart.\u201d Ford said on Monday that she didn\u2019t believe that if Dutton intervened to grant a visa there would be a flow of boats to Australia. \u201cThe reality is, anyone who arrives by boat today is processed offshore, that\u2019s what the Migration Act says.\u201d In response to criticism about the campaign around the family having a detrimental effect on their case, Ford said the situation would have been the same if there was no campaign. \u201cWe had tried to deal with the situation in-house. Obviously it had a media presence for so long anyway, pretty much since they were put in detention. It wasn\u2019t working trying the other way either.\u201d She said while the overwhelming response from the public had been positive, her office had received some hate mail. Rallies were held across the country on Sunday in support of the family, and the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, has appealed directly to the prime minister, Scott Morrison, to show compassion in the case. Dutton also defended the release of information to the Australian about boat arrivals from Sri Lanka, saying there was an ongoing threat of a revival of the people-smuggling trade. He denied the information had been released to make a political point. \u201cWe have provided a lot of detail since I\u2019ve been minister at different points,\u201d he told the Nine Network on Monday. \u201cI think we have publicly made available information in relation to every venture \u2013 we\u2019ll continue to provide that information. \u201cWe need to remind ourselves this is significant. People smugglers are watching everything that happens in Australia. I\u2019m determined that we don\u2019t have any death at sea.\u201d He said the \u201cthreat\u201d out of Sri Lanka was concerning. \u201cIt is the reason Sri Lanka was the first country I visited after the election, to make sure we can keep these boats stopped,\u201d he told the Courier-Mail. \u201cThis threat is very real. \u201cLabor wants people to believe that the threat of new boat arrivals is not real. It is. We are dealing with it every day.\u201d With Australian Associated Press",
