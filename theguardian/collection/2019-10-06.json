Lavanini saw red but Tuilagi escaped with just a penalty after taking out Emiliano Boffelli in the air, fairly as the full-back was a few centimetres from the ground when he was hit.One mistimed challenge and the best-laid plans need redrafting; and a consequence of the crackdown has been an import from football, players demanding cards for opponents and putting pressure on referees, something about which Nigel Owens warned England, through Farrell. \u201cWe are where we need to be and we have not played at our best yet,\u201d said Jones. When England come to the boil, so will their head coach, but it won\u2019t be just yet.",

      "bodyText": "The French president has given Boris Johnson until the end of the week to fundamentally revise his Brexit plan, in a move that increases the chances of the negotiations imploding within days. The UK proposals tabled last week are not regarded in Brussels as being a basis for a deal and Emmanuel Macron emphasised it was up to the UK to think again before an upcoming EU summit. After declining to meet with the prime minister in person, Macron further insisted during a phone call on Sunday that the talks would only be advanced through Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator. \u201cBoris Johnson presented his latest proposals,\u201d an official at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace said of the conversation. \u201cThe president told him that the negotiations should continue swiftly with Michel Barnier\u2019s team in coming days, in order to evaluate at the end of the week whether a deal is possible that respects European Union principles.\u201d Barnier has already said he does not have a mandate from the EU27 to agree a deal on the terms so far presented by Downing Street. The prime minister\u2019s chief negotiator, David Frost, has also been repeatedly told there will be no last-minute negotiations with leaders at the summit on 17 October. The British proposals involve the return of a customs border on the island of Ireland and a Democratic Unionist party veto on Northern Ireland staying in the EU\u2019s single market for goods, an arrangement designed to avoid checks on the border. Macron\u2019s message to Johnson echoed the words of the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, who reportedly told the prime minister in a call on Saturday that the EU27 would not accept an agreement that created a customs border in Ireland. \u201cImportant questions remain about the British proposals,\u201d Rutte later tweeted. Opposition MPs are expected on Monday to push for a vote demanding publication of the full 40-page legal text of the alternative backstop plan presented to the EU by the UK. So far only a seven-page explanatory note has been published. The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, said it was important to see the legal detail \u201cbecause we suspect it will confirm that the government\u2019s proposals unavoidably mean the introduction of infrastructure in Northern Ireland, and that this will contradict the assurances that Johnson gave in the house on Thursday [that no new infrastructure would be required]\u201d. Starmer also said the legal text would clarify whether or not workers\u2019 rights were being protected. Opposition MPs have been able in the past to use the Commons standing order 24 to trigger an emergency debate on a binding \u201chumble address\u201d motion demanding the release of government papers, but such a debate would only go ahead with the approval of the Speaker. With just a few days remaining for the UK to backtrack on key aspects of its proposals, officials in Brussels described the talks as a \u201cfarce\u201d. The two sides appear locked in an impasse. Frost told European commission officials on Friday the UK would not move on its negotiating position until Brussels accepted its main proposals as a basis for the talks. Johnson\u2019s most senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, has told Conservative aides that the government will not fundamentally change its proposals. Meanwhile Latvia\u2019s prime minister, Kri\u0161j\u0101nis Kari\u0146\u0161, told the BBC the onus was on Johnson to make a move. He said: \u201cIf the offer from the UK turns out to be a take-it-or-leave-it, it\u2019s going to be very difficult I see in agreeing. It\u2019s fully dependent on the will of Mr Johnson because from the European side, we\u2019re always open and looking towards a deal.\u201d Given the gap in positions, senior EU sources said Brussels had all but written off the chance of a deal being struck and that the onus was now on avoiding blame. \u201cIncreasingly capitals have the impression the legal text was tabled to be rejected and never meant to a basis for discussion,\u201d said one EU diplomat. Downing Street said that when Johnson spoke to Macron, the prime minister said: \u201cWe have to push forward.\u201d He told the French president that the EU should not be lulled into the mistaken belief that the UK would stay in the EU beyond 31 October in the event of no deal, No 10 said. Stressing that his plan now had more support from MPs than any previous proposal, Johnson told Macron that it was now up to the EU to compromise. A senior No 10 source said: \u201cThe UK has made a big, important offer but it\u2019s time for the commission to show a willingness to compromise too. If not, the UK will leave with no deal. \u201cIf EU leaders are betting that [the Benn act] will prevent no deal, that would be a historic misunderstanding.\u201d Johnson, who also spoke to the Portuguese prime minister, Ant\u00f3nio Costa, at the weekend, is scheduled to have further talks with EU leaders on Monday. Frost is continuing talks with commission officials, and Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, is visiting EU capitals. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, will host another meeting of opposition party leaders at Westminster on Monday, the first since the PM\u2019s plan was published. \u201cThe cross-party meeting will decide what next steps we can take together to hold the government to account, and to ensure the prime minister adheres to the law in seeking an extension if no deal is reached by 19 October,\u201d Corbyn said. Under the Benn act, Johnson will have to request an extension to the UK\u2019s EU membership by 19 October if a deal has not been agreed. In response to claims in the Sunday Telegraph that Johnson would seek to provoke the EU to veto an extension by threatening to be an obstructive member state, one EU official described the government as \u201cbeyond pathetic\u201d. Claims that the government could veto the EU\u2019s budget or impose Nigel Farage as the British commissioner were said to be \u201cnonsense\u201d. The budget is unlikely to be finalised and put to a vote until June next year. The commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, or the European parliament can reject a member state\u2019s nomination for a commissioner portfolio.",

      "bodyText": "Football supporters could have more influence over the way their clubs are run under plans announced by the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn. He said that a Labour government would legislate to ensure that supporters\u2019 trusts had the right to appoint, and sack, at least two members of a club\u2019s board of directors. Labour would also legislate to give supporters\u2019 trusts the right to purchase shares in a club when it changed hands. \u201cA football club is more than just a club, it is an institution at the heart of our communities,\u201d said Corbyn, an enthusiastic Arsenal fan. \u201cClubs are part of the social fabric that binds us together. They are too important to be left in the hands of bad owners who put their business interests ahead of everything else, marginalise supporters and even put the financial security of clubs at risk.\u201d Corbyn announced the plan as part of a package of proposals that he said would \u201cempower fans\u201d and improve football governance. Labour is committed to reviewing the way football is run, ensuring that the Premier League invests 5% of its income from TV rights in the grassroots game and enforcing legislation designed to stop ticket-tout websites selling tickets at inflated prices. It also wants to ensure that the Women\u2019s World Cup is included in the list of key sporting events broadcast free-to-air, and improve access to stadiums for disabled people. Corbyn said that football clubs should be run in the interests of supporters, not their wealthy owners. \u201cSport must be run in the interests of those who participate in it, follow it and love it, not just for the privileged and wealthy few. We will ensure that supporters have a say over how their club is run and review how fans can have more of a say about how all of our sporting bodies are run,\u201d he said. He also said that staff working in football clubs would benefit from Labour\u2019s plans to ban the use of zero-hour contracts and introduce a living wage worth at least \u00a310 an hour.",

      "bodyText": "As Donald Trump strived to enforce message discipline among Republicans in the face of a building threat that he will be impeached, new forces beyond the US president\u2019s control appeared likely to accelerate the congressional impeachment inquiry further in the coming week. At least one additional whistleblower has stepped forward to describe an alleged scheme by Trump to extort Ukraine for dirt on Democratic 2020 presidential rival Joe Biden, the individual\u2019s lawyer announced. Congress is preparing to take testimony on Tuesday from a major figure in the Ukraine scandal, Gordon Sondland, a wealthy hotelier and major Trump donor who was made US ambassador to the European Union. Similar testimony last week by former US special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker led to the disclosure of a damaging series of text messages further implicating Trump in the scandal. And Trump\u2019s would-be defenders in the Republican ranks, with the notable exception of two figures who themselves are deeply implicated in the Ukraine affair \u2013 the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, and Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani \u2013 have fallen mostly silent. No Trump defender from the White House appeared on the US Sunday morning news shows, nor did any members of the congressional Republican political leadership. Trump\u2019s course of self-defense, meanwhile, appeared to be increasingly erratic. The president told House Republicans that his reportedly outgoing energy secretary, Rick Perry, was the secret Machiavelli behind a phone call Trump held with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, central to the scandal, Axios reported. \u201cNot a lot of people know this but, I didn\u2019t even want to make the call,\u201d Trump was quoted as saying. \u201cThe only reason I made the call was because Rick asked me to.\u201d A spokesperson said that Perry had urged Trump to speak with Ukraine about natural gas but not about Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, or a conspiracy theory about Ukrainian election tampering, which were the topics Trump raised on the July call. \u201cLesson to all of you Trump aides,\u201d tweeted Neera Tanden, president of the liberal Center for American Progress, \u201che\u2019s taking you all down with him so you might as well get off the boat while you can.\u201d After a week in which his campaign seemed to dither over Trump\u2019s constant attacks, Biden published a pugilistic op-ed in the Washington Post declaring \u201cenough is enough\u201d. \u201cYou won\u2019t destroy me, and you won\u2019t destroy my family,\u201d the piece concluded. \u201cAnd come November 2020, I intend to beat you like a drum.\u201d On Sunday afternoon, Biden criticized Trump on Twitter. News of at least one more whistleblower with direct knowledge of Trump administration interactions with Ukraine emerged Sunday. \u201cI can confirm that my firm and my team represent multiple whistleblowers in connection to the underlying 12 August disclosure to the Intelligence Community Inspector General,\u201d tweeted Andrew Bakaj. \u201cNo further comment at this time.\u201d Trump spent Sunday morning tweeting outrage at Democrats and at Mitt Romney, who has been the only GOP senator to condemn Trump\u2019s Ukraine dealings in strong, clear terms. At the weekend, Maine Republican senator Susan Collins said of Trump\u2019s comments last week saying China should investigate the Bidens: \u201cI thought the president made a big mistake by asking China to get involved in investigating a political opponent. It\u2019s completely inappropriate.\u201d But the efficacy of Trump\u2019s efforts to keep Republicans onside in his defense was also visible at the weekend, with Pompeo telling reporters in Athens that it was the government\u2019s \u201cduty\u201d to investigate a conservative conspiracy theory placing Ukraine instead of Russia at the heart of 2016 election tampering. That conspiracy theory has been debunked thoroughly. Another Republican senator, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, scrambled on Sunday to make amends for his admission on Friday that he had heard the state department was trying to put together a deal in which military aid for Ukraine would be tied to Zelenskiy\u2019s cooperation in Trump\u2019s alleged conspiracy against Biden. Johnson used an appearance on NBC News\u2019 Meet the Press to become adamant about how Trump had personally told him there was no such linkage, and then, to the intense frustration of host Chuck Todd, Johnson peddled the Ukraine election tampering conspiracy. \u201cWhat happened in 2016?\u201d said Johnson. \u201cWho set him up? Did things spring from Ukraine?\u201d But Colin Powell, the former secretary of state under George W Bush, called the whistleblower a \u201cpatriot\u201d in an appearance on CNN. \u201cThe Republican party has got to get a grip on itself,\u201d Powell said. \u201cRepublican leaders and members of the Congress \u2026 are holding back because they\u2019re terrified of what will happen [to] any one of them if they speak out.\u201d Meanwhile the former Republican congressman Joe Walsh, who has mounted a primary run against Trump, accused Trump of betrayal. \u201cThis president deserves to be impeached,\u201d Walsh said on CNN\u2019s State of the Union. \u201cThis president betrayed his country again this week \u2026 He stood on the White House lawn and told two foreign governments to interfere in our election.

The man, 24, was also charged with one count of unlawful possession of marijuana, department spokesman Martin Brown said. The suspect had been arrested in the deaths of four homeless men who were bludgeoned with a metal pipe as they were sleeping on New York streets, and he has undergone a psychiatric evaluation. Randy Rodriguez Santos was arrested on Saturday in connection with a gruesome night-time attack in the early hours of that day that left the men dead in the Chinatown neighborhood, and resulted in another homeless man suffering serious injuries. The vicious attack left blood splattered on the doorways and sidewalks where the victims had been resting. Police identified one of the victims as an 83-year-old man and haven\u2019t released other information on the victims yet. Police say Santos is also homeless and he was taken into custody with the weapon in his hands as he was fleeing. He has been arrested at least six other times in the past two years. It was unclear early Sunday afternoon if he had an attorney to represent him. Manhattan detective Michael Baldassano had said at a Saturday news conference that the men were attacked at random and police responded to a 911 call just before 2am as one assault was in progress. Two witnesses told responding officers that the suspect was wearing a black jacket and black pants, which helped police find him quickly just a few streets away. Two of the men were killed on the Bowery, a long thoroughfare that cuts north-south in downtown Manhattan, including through the heart of Chinatown, and has for decades been known as New York\u2019s skid row, inhabited by homeless people.

      "bodyText": "Eddie Jones plans to ring the changes against France on Saturday, with England having already qualified for the World Cup quarter-finals, but dismissed suggestions his side would be better off losing and finishing second in their pool. Saturday\u2019s victory over Argentina confirmed England had reached the quarter-finals for the first time since 2011. Jones\u2019s side ran out comfortable winners after Tom\u00e1s Lavanini\u2019s 18th-minute red card and the only downside was Billy Vunipola\u2019s twisted ankle. England are set to confirm the extent of that injury on Monday. Victory, however, means that if England beat France this weekend they will top Pool C. That would most likely mean a quarter-final against Australia with the winner of that match on a collision course with New Zealand \u2013 who racked up the highest points score of the tournament so far against Namibia on Sunday \u2013 in the last four. The losers, meanwhile, are expected to face Wales in the quarter-finals but would be on the opposite side of the draw to the All Blacks and could not meet them until the final. Last year, England\u2019s footballers found themselves in a similar position before their last World Cup group match against Belgium. Gareth Southgate made nine changes to his side with England already assured of qualification and the 1-0 defeat ensured they were on the opposite side of the draw to France \u2013 the eventual winners \u2013 Brazil and the European champions, Portugal. Jones, however, claimed that he has not even looked at permutations despite a likely meeting with his home country. Asked if England need to beat France, Jones said: \u201cI don\u2019t know, [I\u2019m] not even looking at it. The only thing I know is we are playing France. I don\u2019t know any of the permutations, I don\u2019t know where the quarter-final is. It doesn\u2019t concern me because all I\u2019m concerned about is France next week. \u201cWe are where we need to be and we haven\u2019t played to our best yet \u2013 which is good, because we\u2019ve got growth and that\u2019s what this competition is about. It\u2019s about growing, it\u2019s about building, it\u2019s about being right when you need to be right. It\u2019s our next game, our most important game. We want to win every game. I think we can improve the team [against France]. That\u2019ll be the challenge: how can we improve the team?\u201d Mako Vunipola made his comeback from his hamstring injury against Argentina, coming off the bench on 63 minutes and he is likely to start against France. He first suffered the injury in Saracens\u2019 Champions Cup final victory in May but having aggravated it in the World Cup warm-up victory over Ireland last month, Vunipola thought his tournament may have been over. \u201cI had a fear that that could be it,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t really know exactly and didn\u2019t understand what had happened. When I had the scan and got the results back it wasn\u2019t ideal but luckily the specialist was able to clear it up and I am just happy to be here now and get that game under my belt. \u201cWe want to win everything we play in. Next week will be no different, so we want to have a good week\u2019s preparation, prepare for France as best we can and then go out there and try to win the game. It would be difficult for a player to go out there and not have anything but that in their head, that\u2019s how injuries happen and you start overthinking things.\u201d George Ford, who again shone at fly-half against Argentina, was similarly dismissive of the suggestion England should aim to finish second in their pool. \u201cWe can\u2019t fall into that trap one bit. We\u2019ve got to take each game as it comes and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done so far,\u201d he said. \u201cThree games down, we just go for the next one now which is France, who are challenging opponents. I think to win this [tournament] you\u2019ve got to win every single game, so it\u2019s just the next one for us.\u201d Despite already securing England\u2019s qualification, Jones will not be able to attend the funeral of his friend and former Randwick club mentor Jeff Sayle in Australia this week. Jones had hoped to fly back to attend the funeral on Friday before returning for Saturday\u2019s match against France in Yokohama but will now be staying in Japan.

Serie B minnows Arezzo take a punt on a young and unproven manager called Antonio Conte, granting the former Juventus enforcer his first job in management. It doesn\u2019t go well: Conte is given the boot after nine league games, during which his team have cobbled together two goals and two points. His replacement? A bespectacled lower-league journeyman by the name of Maurizio Sarri. It doesn\u2019t go well: Sarri is given the boot after 19 games, with Arezzo rock bottom. His replacement? One Signor Conte. Arezzo rally but in the end cannot escape the drop into Serie C.</p> <p><strong>West London, summer 2018</strong>. Chelsea, a trophy-hoarding Premier League juggernaut, are coming to the end of their patience with Antonio Conte, by now a grizzled serial title-winner. His replacement? Maurizio Sarri, these days one of the hottest properties in Europe following his spectacular transformation of Napoli into the continent\u2019s most thrilling side. Small world.</p> <p><strong>San Siro, October 2019</strong>. Two of Italy\u2019s heavyweights meet for Europe\u2019s game of the season so far with Antonio Conte, newly installed at Inter, looking like he might just manage what Maurizio Sarri never could: break Juventus\u2019 iron grip on Serie A. It\u2019s eight in a row now for Juve and given that three of those were won by Conte, it would be quite the drama if he was the man to end the run \u2013 not to mention a pretty bad look for the incoming Sarri, whose list of so-called major trophies currently begins and ends with last season\u2019s Europa League.</p> <p><strong>All the pieces are in place for a gripping game</strong>: a reigning superpower against a rallying force, a host of high-class one-on-one battles (Asamoah v Cuadrado, Sensi v Pjanic, Ronaldo v Godin) and the chance for the insurgents to make a statement and open up a five-point lead at the top. Forget second-division relegation scraps \u2013 this game could go some way to deciding the top-flight title. We\u2019ve come a long way since Arezzo.

Inter may have come into this meeting as leaders but Juve used this as a chance to clamp them in a headlock, march them around the playground and remind them just who the bigger boys are. It was a great contest \u2013 and the first half especially was sublime entertainment \u2013 but in truth Juve were the better side throughout and are well worth their win. Higuain is the hero from the bench, and Sarri is left looking a very smart man indeed. The champions are back on top \u2013 for now. 90+3: Juve\u2019s players have spent the lack few minutes taking it in turns to writhe around on the ground, and the clock ticks down accordingly. Not long now. 88 mins: Inter force a corner but Szczesny does exactly what\u2019s needed and come out to claim commandingly. Then Barella goes down on the edge of the box in a desperate bid for a free-kick. He\u2019s rewarded with a yellow card. Juve look like holding on here. 86 mins: Golden chance for Vecino, who is put through by a slide-rule D\u2019Ambrosio pass but \u2013 on the stretch \u2013 can\u2019t quite lift his shot over Szczesny. That Juve goal in all its glory: 82 mins. Inter need something now, and have enough time to put together a feasible kitchen-sink job. Emre Can is booked for a clumsy foul. 80 mins: Brilliant goal. Juventus work their way to the edge of the box, where Ronaldo and Bentancur exchange precision passes before the latter releases Higuain, who\u2019s wriggled into space between the centre-back and full-back in the inside right channel. He latches on to the ball, controls and drills a no-frills finish under Handanovic. Quick, simple and brutally effective. 77 mins: Inter break and again it\u2019s Martinez looking to provide the cutting edge, turning on the D and hitting an early strike. It\u2019s scuffed, but it gets a deflection. Corner. That\u2019s his last contribution, as Conte sends on Politano. A shame. 74 mins: Ronaldo escapes down the left again and sends a laser-guided cutback towards Higuain, who dummies and leaves it for Bentancur but he\u2019s beaten to the ball \u2013 by a split-second \u2013 by Brozovic. Juve want a penalty but they aren\u2019t getting one. 70 mins: A first contribution from Higain as he muscles off Brozovic and feeds Ronaldo down the inside left. He offers his marker a quick stepover then blams a low left-foot drive at Handanovic, who gets down to save. Emre Can enters the fray Dybala. 69 mins: Vecino spins on the edge of the box and unleashes on goal. A huge deflection takes the ball inches wide, with Szczesny rooted to the spot. That could have gone anywhere. 66 mins: The electric Martinez slaloms into the box, but tries to beat the last defender rather than squaring to a teammate who would\u2019ve had a clearcut chance. Lovely play \u2013 but greedy play. A minute later Bonucci bundles Lukaku down inside the box, less shoulder-to-shoulder than shoulder-to-back. But no pen. 61 mins: The first change for Juve: Bentancur comes on for Khedira. And, more importantly, the second: Higuain for Bernardeschi. Juve are going for this. 58 mins: Lovely feet by Bonucci, dancing around Lukaku on halfway and caressing a pass into the feet of Bernardeschi, who is quickly pounced on and dispossessed by De Vrij. He goes down clutching his face, but there was nothing untoward about that \u2013 yet Inter are still obliged to kick the ball out rather the mount an attack. Yawn. 56 mins: Juve attack again. Ronaldo holds it up well and offloads to Lhedira, whose through-ball to Dybala is perfectly timed. But the striker can barely collect the ball before Handanovic is at his feet, smothering the initial effort and doing enough to force the rebound over. Still 1-1, but starting to look ominous for Inter. 54 mins: Alex Sandro and Matuidi work their way neatly forward down the left before laying off to an onrushing Ronaldo, who lashes wide from distance. Conte makes his second change, Bastoni replacing Godin. 51 mins: Martinez v De Ligt is turning into the battle of the night, and they lock horns again as the Dutchman slides in to dispossess the attacker, who has flicked and tricked his way to the edge of the box. Down the other end, Inter engage in some absurdly risky possession-keeping between their defenders and keeper, each pass inviting a deadly interception. Brozovic eventually sees sense and hoofs the ball violently clear. 47 mins: Matuidi scoots down the left and fires a low cross into Dybala, but his snapshot is sliced into oblivion. A minute later Ronaldo goes down under a frisky challenge on the edge of the box \u2013 a running theme so far \u2013 but no foul. Frown, pout, scowl. The second half kicks off, and within seconds Inter are pressed into an early error. Juve throw. \u2026 and here\u2019s Ronaldo\u2019s non-goal: Half-time viewing \u2013 Matthijs de Ligt\u2019s moment of silliness, punished according by Lautaro Mart\u00ednez: Dybala storms into the box in stoppage time and takes a tumble after an imaginary foul from Godin. The referee isn\u2019t fooled and waves play on \u2013 and Inter hurtle down the pitch to release Lukaku, but he is forced wide, his shot is blocked and cleared. Then peep-peep, and both sets of players use the half-time whistle as the green light to enter into a mass ruckus on their way down the tunnel. Coaching staff enter the fray to calm it all down \u2013 lovely stuff. This has been breathless. 41 mins: Ronaldo comes close to putting Juventus back into the lead. It\u2019s a lovely move which he starts by drifting out to the left and feeding Matuidi, whose low cross is laid off first-time by Dybala to Ronaldo. His low shot is firm but saved by Handanovic. And yet seconds later he latches on to another Dybala pass to fire Juventus ahead! Except he hasn\u2019t! The Argentine had strayed just offside, and celebrations are cut short. But I\u2019ll tell you a secret: that Ronaldo goal is most definitely coming. 36 mins: The game has settled down somewhat and Juve are asserting themselves. Ronaldo is heavily involved and Cuadrado inevitably dangerous when he gets forward from right-back. But he\u2019s a liability, too: under no pressure near his own corner flag, he passes right across the face of his own box and comes within inches of seeing it intercepted by the onrushing Martinez. Clearly they don\u2019t teach Catenaccio in Colombia. Juve\u2019s first goal: 33 mins: Stefano Sensi\u2019s game is over, he\u2019s picked up an injury and trudges off in a huff, Mat\u00edas Vecino his replacement. 28 mins: Pjanic aims a deep cross for Ronaldo, who can\u2019t quite do enough to meet a ball that\u2019s just behind him. But the Portuguese has seen lots of the ball so far, dropping deep to get it in a manner unusual for his latter-years self. Then Lukaku and Martinez link again, the former nutmegging De Ligt on the turn to feed his strike partner, who unleashes from distance to force a flying save from Szczesny. This has been sensational entertainment. 25 mins: A frenzied opening quarter finally hits something resembling a lull, with a bout of unhurried possession play from either side. The livewire Martinez charges forward and exchanges passes with Lukaku, forcing Szczesny to come out and intercept. 21 mins: Juve free-kick 30 yards out. Ronaldo adopts his alpha-dog stance, puffs out his chest and belts it purposefully into the wall. Martinez steps up and drills his kick low and hard into the bottom corner, Szczesny guessing the right way yet left with no chance. But what on earth was De Ligt doing?! He should have headed it \u2013 instead he practically punched it away. Penalty to Inter! De Ligt goes to meet a cross but inexplicably leads with his elbow, and handballs it to \u201csafety\u201d. Madness. 15 mins: Inter put together their first spell of sustained possession, working the ball neatly from left to right and Barella eventually seeing his cross headed away. The corner comes to nothing, half-cleared to Barella whose volley is wild and wide. 12 mins: Alex Sandro is booked for stopping Inter taking a quick throw. 11 mins: Godin leaves Ronaldo in a heap again as the pair tangle on halfway. No foul this time. Ronaldo aims an angry pout in the direction of the ref. Then a fired-up Skriniar does the same to Dybala \u2013 foul. Very tasty so far. 9 mins: Juve attack down the left again, Ronaldo cutting inside this time and rattling the bar with a piledriver from the edge of the box. Inter charge up the other end and feed Lukaku, but the angle tightens and the chance never quite materialises. What a game! 8 mins: Juve pull off an eerily similar move, this time releasing Ronaldo down the inside-left channel and into the box. Inter\u2019s defence have learned their lesson, though, and close down early. Shot blocked. What a start! First blood to Juve and Sarri\u2019s big call is vindicated immediately as Dybala collects a lofted pass from Pjanic, dribbles into the box and is afforded just enough space to rifle an early left-foot shot past a suspiciously flat-footed Handanovic. 4 mins: A first touch for Ronaldo, and within a split second he\u2019s clattered by Godin. The striker, in a heap, wins a free-kick on halfway. 3 mins: D\u2019Ambrosio breaks down the right for Inter and exchanges passes with Barella before seeing his low cross deflected out for a corner. Nice move. And we\u2019re off. Juventus take kickoff and within a minute have whipped a couple of crosses into Inter\u2019s box. Godin clears with conviction. The teams observe a minute\u2019s silence to mark the death of Sassuolo president Giorgio Squinzi on Wednesday. The teams are out, and we\u2019re treated to a brief operatic anthem before they disperse into formation. Sarri and Conte embrace, all smiles. Kickoff imminent. So Federico Bernardeschi gets the nod over Aaron Ramsey in the Juventus midfield, quite possibly thanks to his goal in the Champions League on Tuesday. No such luck for Gonzalo Higuain, though, who scored one and set one up in midweek but is dropped to the bench today. In his stead, Paulo Dybala, a more mercurial player but one who brings an energy and trickery Higuain doesn\u2019t. Alongside him: You Know Who. As for Inter, it\u2019s as expected: Romelu Lukaku next to Lautaro Mart\u00ednez up top, and Stefano Sensi tasked with lying on the chances. Diego Godin will marshall Antonio Conte\u2019s signature three-man backline, and resume his rivalry with You Know Who. A comprehensive scene-setter: Inter: Handanovic; Godin, De Vrij, Skriniar; D\u2019Ambrosio, Barella, Brozovic, Sensi, Asamoah; Lautaro, Lukaku. Juventus: Szczesny; Cuadrado, Bonucci, De Ligt, Alex Sandro; Khedira, Pjanic, Matuidi; Bernardeschi; Ronaldo, Dybala Tuscany, summer 2006. Serie B minnows Arezzo take a punt on a young and unproven manager called Antonio Conte, granting the former Juventus enforcer his first job in management. It doesn\u2019t go well: Conte is given the boot after nine league games, during which his team have cobbled together two goals and two points. His replacement? A bespectacled lower-league journeyman by the name of Maurizio Sarri. It doesn\u2019t go well: Sarri is given the boot after 19 games, with Arezzo rock bottom. His replacement? One Signor Conte. Arezzo rally but in the end cannot escape the drop into Serie C. West London, summer 2018. Chelsea, a trophy-hoarding Premier League juggernaut, are coming to the end of their patience with Antonio Conte, by now a grizzled serial title-winner. His replacement? Maurizio Sarri, these days one of the hottest properties in Europe following his spectacular transformation of Napoli into the continent\u2019s most thrilling side. Small world. San Siro, October 2019. Two of Italy\u2019s heavyweights meet for Europe\u2019s game of the season so far with Antonio Conte, newly installed at Inter, looking like he might just manage what Maurizio Sarri never could: break Juventus\u2019 iron grip on Serie A. It\u2019s eight in a row now for Juve and given that three of those were won by Conte, it would be quite the drama if he was the man to end the run \u2013 not to mention a pretty bad look for the incoming Sarri, whose list of so-called major trophies currently begins and ends with last season\u2019s Europa League. All the pieces are in place for a gripping game: a reigning superpower against a rallying force, a host of high-class one-on-one battles (Asamoah v Cuadrado, Sensi v Pjanic, Ronaldo v Godin) and the chance for the insurgents to make a statement and open up a five-point lead at the top. Forget second-division relegation scraps \u2013 this game could go some way to deciding the top-flight title. We\u2019ve come a long way since Arezzo. Strap in.",

Algol is located in the constellation of Perseus and is one of only a few stars that can be seen to change brightness with the naked eye. This extraordinary characteristic led our ancestors to associate it with the severed head of the gorgon Medusa being held in Perseus\u2019s hand. The name Algol derives from an Arabic word that translates into ghoul or demon. Algol\u2019s brightness changes because there is a smaller, dimmer star in orbit around it.

      "bodyText": "This week offers northern hemisphere observers a good opportunity to see a variable star in action. Algol is located in the constellation of Perseus and is one of only a few stars that can be seen to change brightness with the naked eye. This extraordinary characteristic led our ancestors to associate it with the severed head of the gorgon Medusa being held in Perseus\u2019s hand. The name Algol derives from an Arabic word that translates into ghoul or demon. Algol\u2019s brightness changes because there is a smaller, dimmer star in orbit around it. Every 2.87 days, that smaller star passes in front of its larger, brighter companion, blocking out some of its light. From beginning to end, these eclipses last for about 10 hours. The chart shows the view looking east at 20.55 GMT on 8 October. At this time, Algol will be in mid-eclipse and its brightness will be less than half its normal value. Over the next five hours, it will return to full brightness.",

Woolworths, Caltex, Origin Energy, AMP and Incitec Pivot are among 13 companies that declared sizeable political donations to the Liberal and Labor parties to the Australian Electoral Commission, but failed to declare them when seeking approval to develop property in NSW. In one case Woolworths failed to declare more than $100,000 in donations to the NSW Liberals and Nationals while seeking to secure minor approvals for a supermarket at Mullumbimby. The revelations have prompted an investigation by the state\u2019s planning department, which pledged to \u201ctake action\u201d if it confirmed breaches detected by the Guardian.</p> <p><strong>A second whistleblower </strong><strong>has described an alleged plot by Donald Trump to extort Ukraine </strong><strong>for dirt on one of his Democratic rivals, Joe Biden, </strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/06/trump-ukraine-scandal-second-whistleblower-comes-forward\">according to Mark Zaid, a lawyer for the first whistleblower in the case</a>.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Stephen Smiley bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 7 October. Top stories Some of Australia\u2019s biggest corporations have hidden political donations from planning authorities, which is a criminal offence in New South Wales, a Guardian investigation has found. Woolworths, Caltex, Origin Energy, AMP and Incitec Pivot are among 13 companies that declared sizeable political donations to the Liberal and Labor parties to the Australian Electoral Commission, but failed to declare them when seeking approval to develop property in NSW. In one case Woolworths failed to declare more than $100,000 in donations to the NSW Liberals and Nationals while seeking to secure minor approvals for a supermarket at Mullumbimby. The revelations have prompted an investigation by the state\u2019s planning department, which pledged to \u201ctake action\u201d if it confirmed breaches detected by the Guardian. A second whistleblower has described an alleged plot by Donald Trump to extort Ukraine for dirt on one of his Democratic rivals, Joe Biden, according to Mark Zaid, a lawyer for the first whistleblower in the case. Zaid has described the person as a member of the intelligence community. An account by a second whistleblower reinforcing the original whistleblower complaint, which was made public two weeks ago, could accelerate the impeachment inquiry against Trump announced by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on 24 September. The French president Emmanuel Macron has given Boris Johnson until the end of the week to fundamentally revise his Brexit plan, in a move that increases the chances of the negotiations imploding within days. The UK proposals tabled last week, which include the return of a customs border on the island of Ireland, are not regarded in Brussels as being a basis for a deal. After declining to meet with the prime minister in person, Macron emphasised that it was up to the UK to think again about its offer before an upcoming EU summit. World Thousands of people have turned out in heavy rain across Hong Kong to denounce a ban on face masks. But instead of cowing protesters, the ban has enraged them, with the marching crowds shouting \u201cHong Kong resist\u201d and \u201cwearing a mask is not a crime\u201d. An Iraqi interior ministry spokesman says an investigation is underway to determine the source of live fire that killed protesters during six days of unrest that have left more than 100 people dead and thousands injured. Saudi Arabia has lifted some restrictions on tourists travelling in the country, with new guidelines allowing foreign men and women to share a room without proof of marriage. The change comes after Riyadh launched its first tourist visa scheme. Ginger Baker, one of the most brilliant, versatile and turbulent drummers in the history of British music, has died aged 80. According to a post on his Facebook page, the Cream drummer, who straddled jazz, blues and rock, \u201cpassed away peacefully\u201d. Authorities in Kansas City, Kansas, say two men who opened fire in a bar, killing four, had apparently been in some sort of disagreement with people inside. They say the men had left the bar but returned with handguns. Opinion and analysis The dire conditions in a refugee camp in Greece give traumatised children little hope of healing, writes neurologist and author Jules Montague: \u201cAyesha is nine years old.

      "bodyText": "Sebastian Coe says he has not yet read the report that led to Alberto Salazar being banned for four years by the US Anti-Doping Agency \u2013 but insists that athletics does more than most sports to catch drug cheats. The revelation came when the International Association of Athletics Federations president was asked what he thought about the Nike CEO, Mark Parker, exchanging emails with Salazar, in which they discussed testing testosterone on the legendary US coach\u2019s son. Lord Coe, who was a long-term consultant for Nike, replied: \u201cI haven\u2019t actually read the report. I\u2019ve read the executive summary, which took me through what was actually said. That was enough for me to get into business mode, which was to make sure that athletes don\u2019t have a relationship with a suspended coach.\u201d Coe also cautioned those criticising Sifan Hassan, the Dutch athlete previously coached by Salazar, after she raced away from her rivals to win gold at the 10,000m and 1,500m. When it was put to Coe that the British athlete Laura Muir had said that the race would be \u201cunder a cloud\u201d because of Salazar\u2019s ban, he answered: \u201cSadly it is the world we live in.

We\u2019re encouraged to rummage around, but look too closely and the illusion starts to fall away; empty files, unfilled patient forms and charity-shop price stickers still stuck on. If plot and game mechanics are limited, the adrenaline \u2013 for a while at least \u2013 delivers. It\u2019s hard not to have fun, and you should try not screaming when a drooling zombie hurtles at you in a pitch-black room. My friend and I leave dusty, sweaty and \u2013 in second and fourth place \u2013 pretty pleased with ourselves. But as we leave the building, I start to feel a bit faint. Is that a bite mark on my leg? \u2022 At 39 New Oxford Street, London, until 31 December.",

Peace and love to his family.\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaulMcCartney/status/1180831912811782144\">Paul McCartney tweeted</a>: \u201cGreat drummer, wild and lovely guy \u2026 Sad to hear that he died but the memories never will.\u201d</p> <p>The family of the late Jack Bruce, the band\u2019s lead vocalist and bassist in one of Baker\u2019s bands Cream, published a statement on Twitter saying: \u201cSurviving a love-hate relationship, Ginger was like an older brother to Jack, their chemistry was truly spectacular. RIP Ginger, one of the greatest drummers of all time.\u201d</p> <p>Baker was born Peter Edward Baker in 1939 in Lewisham, south London, and grew up amid the blitz; his father was killed in action in 1943. He began drumming in his mid-teens, remembering in 2009: \u201cI\u2019d never sat behind a kit before, but I sat down \u2013 and I could play! One of the musicians turned round and said, \u2018Bloody hell, we\u2019ve got a drummer\u2019, and I thought, \u2018Bloody hell, I\u2019m a drummer!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Early work came with the jazz guitarist Diz Disley \u2013 which ended when an 18-year-old Baker set fire to a hotel while on tour in Europe \u2013 and with bandleader Terry Lightfoot. He played blues in Blues Incorporated \u2013 including guest appearances with an early incarnation of the Rolling Stones \u2013 and US R&amp;B with the Graham Bond Organisation, both alongside Jack Bruce on bass guitar.</p> <p>Despite considerable friction between Baker and Bruce, the pair in 1966 formed Cream with Eric Clapton, who had previously played with the Yardbirds and John Mayall. Cream helped define the psychedelic rock sound of the decade, with Baker bringing both a jazz sensibility \u2013 Toad, from debut album Fresh Cream, features one of the first ever drum solos in rock \u2013 and a hard-hitting style, using two bass drums, that pointed towards heavy metal.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hftgytmgQgE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hftgytmgQgE?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Cream sold more than 15m records worldwide and had hits including Sunshine of Your Love, Strange Brew and White Room; three of their four albums reached both the US and UK top five.</p> <p>The band split in 1968, releasing a final album in 1969. A reunion in 2005 ended in animosity, with Baker and Bruce shouting at each other on stage in New York. In 1969, Baker and Clapton formed the short-lived band Blind Faith with Steve Winwood and Ric Grech, and the latter pair joined Baker in his next project, jazz-rock band Ginger Baker\u2019s Air Force.</p> <p>Winwood said yesterday that Baker\u2019s death was \u201ca very sad loss ... a loss also for his contribution to music. He was well-grounded in jazz from very early on and later managed to combine this with African and rock music to create his own inimitable style of playing.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cBeneath his somewhat abrasive exterior, there was a very sensitive human being with a heart of gold.

      "bodyText": "So that\u2019s it for another week! I\u2019ll be back next Saturday at the earlier time of 6.40pm for another spin round the liveblog dancefloor \u2013 thank you so much for all your brilliant comments, and don\u2019t forget to pop back on Tuesday for Rhik\u2019s GBBO liveblog. Have a fabulous week! Hx They say lovely things about each other, then take to the floor for their final dance to \u2018My Heart Will Go On\u2019 from Titanic. Presumably because Kate Winslet\u2019s door was less wooden than Anneka, but I still love her. In a verdict that will surprise precisely nobody, all the judges save David and Nadiya. Which means ANNEKA AND KEVIN are leaving the competition. That\u2019s a very early exit for Kevin this year, he\u2019s going to have an awful lot of time on his hands to polish his glitterball. Gotta love Anneka \u2013 her taxi is running and she\u2019s not really trying. I can\u2019t remember if this was a Charleston or a Jive, and it\u2019s really impossible to tell from watching the steps. \u201cAnneka and Kevin have done all they can\u201d, aka the absolute bare minimum. OK that\u2019s over - let\u2019s revisit Nadiya\u2019s frock, which is exquisite. Hands up if you have any interest in watching these two routines again. Nope, me neither. So who is joining Anneka and Kevin in the bottom two? Saffron and AJ are safe, along with Chris and Karen, Michelle and Giovanni and Mike and Katya. Which means DAVID AND NADIYA are in the dance-off. Katya looked a bit sick there for a minute. I don\u2019t think this is going to end well for Anneka \u2013 David looked a little improved last night, and there was real sensitivity in their American Smooth. Also that rubber mask was weirdly attractive, but that\u2019s by the by. I\u2019m so glad we\u2019re revisting #teethgate. Will never not be funny. Craig\u2019s jacket is like one of those magic eye pictures. If you stare at it long enough, a 3D dolphin emerges. I\u2019m not sure if his microphone is a bit shonky, but Harry sounds like he\u2019s singing from the bottom of a well. I know anything goes, but that seems like a weird take. Also: Anton and Nadiya dancing in a rather splendid fashion. Time for a musical interlude, courtesy of vintage crooner Harry Connick Jr. I think of him as a 1990s version of Michael Buble, but cooler and less Christmassy. He\u2019s singing the Cole Porter classic \u2018Anything Goes\u2019. Also through to next week: Catherine and Johannes, Dev and Dianne, Will and Janette and Karim and Amy. So which couples are safely through to next week? Emma and Anton are through, along with Kelvin and Oti, Alex and Neil and Emma and Aljaz. First couple in the bottom two: ANNEKA AND KEVIN. Well, that\u2019s not a huge surprise. Taxi for Kevin, helicopter for Anneka. Re. first tens for Kelvin and Oti, I notice there have been a few rumblings about him being a ringer. As far as I can tell he did a year of ballet lessons at the age of 8; so did I, and I\u2019m still a terrible dancer. If it were that easy, we\u2019d all be in the Pussycat Dolls. Previously on Strictly: Movie Week! A few award winners, a few rotten tomatoes, and a few that probably should have gone straight to DVD. Also featured a classic Strictly moment during Emma and Anton\u2019s judging \u2013 if you haven\u2019t seen it, watch on iPlayer or BBC Strictly on Instagram, is still making me laugh 24 hours on. Also apologies to anyone with a Strictly Come Bingo hangover, I really must try to go to the cinema more often. TESS AND CLAUDIA DRESS WATCH: Tess in black velvet swagging with shoulders so huge It looks like she\u2019s left the coat hanger in, and Claudia in another sparkly bin bag. Both deeply unflattering. And we\u2019re off! Tonight\u2019s pro dance is taking us on a magical tour of cinematic history, from Giovanni as Charlie Chaplin to Nadiya as Julie Andrews. It\u2019s rather wonderful, and I must watch it again later to catch all the details. Tonight\u2019s Countryfile Casual Weatherperson is the lovely Helen Willets, looking wonderfully autumnal in a mustard knit and necklace made of giant chocolate buttons. Sadly she\u2019s a bit smart compared to Ben Rich last week - Ben was a Casual 9/10, Helen is a 5 at best. I\u2019ll be scoring their casualness all season, mostly because I can. Feel like I should actually buy a Countryfile Calendar this year, despite it featuring a ringer harvest mouse. All this harvest chat on Countryfile is making me hungry. Really fancy an apple. Or ideally a cider. Evening all, and welcome back for the Sunday night results show! It\u2019s the evening after the night before, and we\u2019ve all had time to reflect on Strictly Movie Night. Was it bad, or good? Or so bad it was good? I actually really enjoyed it; it was proper Saturday night escapist entertainment, and god knows we could all do with a bit of that right now. The Panda Samba thing was mad though, let\u2019s pretend that never happened. Tonight we need to send another couple on their way \u2013 my guess is a David/Anneka showdown, but am a bit worried for Alex and Neil doing a Rumba in the slot of death. Kick off is at 7.15pm, see you then! Thanks everyone for joining in \u2013 I\u2019m off to lie down in a darkened room to read your comments \u2013 please come and say hello on Twitter @heidistephens if you\u2019re passing. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow for the Results Show at 7.15, so see you then! Hx Time for an interminable recap \u2013 my faves this week were Michelle and Giovanni, Kelvin and Oti, Dev and Dianne and Anton\u2019s teeth. Surely David and Anneka have to be lining up for the bottom two? So that\u2019s it for the dancing, and the voting is now open! WHAT a week, I\u2019m so sorry about the boozy bingo. Who knew I\u2019d seen so few films?? Scores: 9,9,9,9 - a total of 36 for Dev and Dianne. Bruno thought it was genius \u2013 inspired, original and a magical carpet ride. Craig though Dev danced it brilliantly, and Motsi agrees \u2013 it was epic and it\u2019s one of those dances they\u2019ll remember forever. Shirley is speechless at all the performances this evening, but Dev\u2019s dance was stunning. Dev is distractingly blue (bare chest DRINK), and there\u2019s some great choreography in this routine. It feels a bit disjointed in places but Dev can clearly dance and he\u2019s giving this both barrels with some pretty epic footwork. No idea what criteria I\u2019m supposed to be judging this on (does anyone?), but enjoyed it very much. And FINALLY, it\u2019s DEV AND DIANNE! This week they\u2019re dancing a Couples\u2019 Choice routine to \u2018Friend Like Me\u2019 by Will Smith from Aladdin. Oh lord, I\u2019d forgotten Couples\u2019 Choice was a thing. Why is it still a thing? They\u2019ve gone for the street/commercial option. I\u2019ve seen the animated version of this film, but not the new version. We\u2019ll count that as a win in support of your ruined livers. Scores: 6,7,7,7 - a total of 27 for Emma and Anton. BREATHE, Heidi. Shirley thought it had nice rotation and Emma executed it with great enjoyment. Bruno loved the swinging 60s flavour with nice stylistic touches, but she could have sold it a bit more. Craig was distracted by Anton\u2019s wig and fake teeth, and Emma underdanced it a bit. It turns out that they\u2019re Anton\u2019s own teeth, and the studio has lost it. Craig looks mortified, this is classic. I have no idea what Motsi said, I\u2019m in bits. I am loving Emma\u2019s dress and boots, they are outstanding. This is lacking a bit of party energy and I\u2019ve had liked it to be a bit more cheeky given the film, but Emma can definitely dance and her footwork is great. Sadly we wanted Beyonce, but got Liz Hurley. Only two left! Next up it\u2019s EMMA AND ANTON. This week they\u2019re dancing the Salsa to \u2018Soul Bossa Nova\u2019 by Quincy Jones from Austin Powers. Obviously I\u2019ve seen this film, but I can\u2019t imagine that anything other than hard liquor is going to get us through Anton as Austin Powers. Scores: 4,4,4,4 - a total of 16 for David and Nadiya. Motsi thought David came back fighting, but she definitely saw an improvement. Shirley agrees, there were lots of nice sensitive parts to the dance. Bruno liked the movement and connection, David is moving in the right direction. Craig thought there was too much rise and fall and David needed more expression in the arms, but there was a modicum of improvement. In flies David, like the world\u2019s most nonchalant Batman. Lots of fog obscuring his feet, which is something of a blessing. This is definitely better than last week, and he handles the lifts nicely. Actually rather enjoyed that; dancing aside, David performed that really well. Next up it\u2019s DAVID AND NADIYA! Their Movie Week dance is the American Smooth (Viennese Waltz version) to \u2018Kiss From A Rose\u2019 by Seal from Batman Forever. It will surprise precisely nobody that I have not seen this film. Please drink. Is anyone still conscious? Frankly some kind of miraculous dance transformation is going to keep David out of the bottom two this week, but maybe being Batman will help. Or maybe it will just be another cape he doesn\u2019t have a clue what to do with. Scores: 3,5,5,5 -. a total of 18 for Mike and Katya. Craig thought it looked like Mike\u2019s jockstrap was too tight, as there was no hip action. But Mike went for broke. Motsi wanted to watch it again, she loves how he \u2018interprets dancing\u2019. Shirley thought it was better than last week, but his feet need to make a phone call to his tummy and his middle bits (OKAY). Bruno thought it wasn\u2019t quite magic and nearly tragic. Mike Bushell slides down the firefighter\u2019s pole, absolutely channelling the spirit (if not the abs) of Channing Tatum. Off comes a layer of clothing, to reveal a sparkly shirt and tie (oh thank goodness). As a Cha Cha Cha it\u2019s perfectly average, but who cares - actual Mike Bushell is giving it full hip thrust. Oh my god he just dropped Katya. Incredible. It\u2019s time for MIKE AND KATYA! This week they\u2019re dancing the Cha Cha Cha to \u2018It\u2019s Raining Men\u2019 by The Weather Girls from Magic Mike. I haven\u2019t seen the film, but I have definitely looked at the pictures. Have already lined up ALL the cushions to hide behind. Drink everything within reach. Ten couples down, four to go! Stay with me, people. Scores: 7,7,7,7 - a total of 28 for Saffron and AJ. Bruno loved the fighting spirit, but it needed more Spanish flavour. Craig thought the footwork was a bit haphazard, but he loved the performance \u2013 it was strong and focussed. Motsi loved the intensity, Saffron gave 110% but she needs to breathe more in the slower dances. Shirley loved the performance, but Saffron needs to secure her balance as she moves forward in the competition. This is festival of pleather and foot-obscuring fog, but some lovely footwork from Saffron and lots of great atmosphere. It\u2019s a bit stompy in places, but actually really enjoyed that. It\u2019s time for SAFFRON AND AJ. This week they\u2019re dancing the Paso Doble to \u2018Everybody Wants To Rule The World\u2019 by Lorde from The Hunger Games. I have seen this film many times, the daughter was a huge fan. Don\u2019t remember this song though, assuming it\u2019s the John Lewis version of the Tears for Fears 80s classic. Can\u2019t wait to see how AJ has choreographed this Paso, nothing says Strictly sparkle like portraying a dystopian gameshow where children have to kill each other through the medium of dance. Scores: 2,3,3,3 - a total of 11 for Anneka and Kevin. Shirley thought Anneka was stunning, and she handled the props and speed well. But she needs to work on the timing, it was a bit frenetic. Bruno thought Anneka did \u2018slaughter the Charleston\u2019 rather than \u2018Kill Bill\u2019. Craig thought it was stopping and starting like a bad internet connection, and really wasn\u2019t very good. Motsi liked the energy, there was a LOT of running. Mostly this Charleston involves stick waving, which gives us something else to look at other than Anneka\u2019s feet, which appear to be dancing to something else entirely. She\u2019s a great sport and I love the personality, but as a Charleston it\u2019s a bit shambolic. Next up it\u2019s ANNEKA AND KEVIN. Their Movie Week dance is the Charleston to \u2018Woo Hoo\u2019 by The 5.6.7.8\u2019s from Kill Bill. I have seen this film! Also I can\u2019t get the idea out of my head that \u2018Woo Hoo\u2019 is actually Blur\u2019s Song 2, which would be a mad but excellent choice for a Charleston. Scores: 7,7,7,7 - a total of 28 for Emma and Aljaz. Motsi thought the choreography was beautiful and sensitive, but Emma lost it a little in hold. Shirley agrees that Emma needs to get her top line in order, but the timing was exquisite. Bruno thought they provided very pleasing service, but Emma needs to work on her core to sustain her top line. Craig agrees on Emma\u2019s frame and there was gapping throughout, but he loved the concept. So Emma is a maid, and Aljaz is a sexy butler. The music is beautiful, and this is a wonderfully romantic and moving Foxtrot. Emma\u2019s top line looks slightly on the wonk and there\u2019s a LOT of gapping, but charming nonetheless. It\u2019s time for EMMA AND ALJA\u017d. This week they\u2019re dancing the Foxtrot to \u2018Downton Abbey\u2019 by John Lunn from the film Downton Abbey. Of course I haven\u2019t seen it, it\u2019s only been in the cinema for five minutes. Also it\u2019s the movie version of Downton Abbey, are you insane. In training, Mrs Hughes! Scores: 9,9,10,10 - a total of 38 for Kelvin and Oti. Drink everything. Craig thought it was FABULOUS, Motsi thought it had charm, energy and loads of tiny details. Shirley thought Kelvin made a difficult routine look easy on the eye \u2013 absolutely superb. Bruno thought it was as good as anything he\u2019s seen on the West End stage. Are we going to see our first 10 of the series??? Ooh, flaming torches AND a load of Strictly lampposts! As expected, Kelvin is smashing this Charleston with great swivel and characterisation, although the lifts were a bit wobblesome. Great fun and an incredible performance, really enjoyed that. Next up it\u2019s KELVIN AND OTI! Their Movie Week dance is the Charleston to \u2018Trip A Little Light Fantastic\u2019 by Lin Manuel Miranda from Mary Poppins Returns. I haven\u2019t seen this (DRINK), although I\u2019ve seen the first one about 500 times. Christ, they\u2019re wheeling out ALL the cute kids this week. Scores: 6,6,5,6 - a total of 23 for Will and Janette. Bruno loved the power and aggression, but he would have liked more artistry from Will. Craig thought it had strength, intent and purpose. Motsi liked the tension in Will\u2019s body, he unleashed some power. Shirley thought it was a bit staccato, but a very good try. Obviously I have no idea what on earth is going on, but Will kicks off with a lovely Spanish line and that\u2019s all I\u2019m after. A bit stompy, but he has great timing and excellent Paso face. Happy to ignore Janette being dressed as a banana that\u2019s been left in the fruitbowl too long, enjoyed that very much. It\u2019s time for WILL AND JANETTE! This week they\u2019re dancing the Paso Doble to \u2018Gotta Catch \u2018Em All\u2019 \u2013 the original theme from Pokemon. Ooh I\u2019ve seen this! Haha only kidding, of course I haven\u2019t. DRINK. Scores: 8,8,8,8 - a total of 32 for Catherine and Johannes. Shirley was overwhelmed \u2013 normally Week 3 Rumba\u2019s make Shirley cringe (SHADE for Alex and Neil), but it was lovely. Bruno thought it had great fluidity and expression \u2013 it was Catherine\u2019s breakthrough dance. Craig noticed there were times when Catherine didn\u2019t have a foot on the ground, but otherwise stunning. Motsi loved how Catherine\u2019s whole body was alive, it was absolutely sensational. Well this is a lovely romantic Rumba, despite a guitar playing the third wheel. Definitely some hip action from Catherine, as Rumbas go that was rather good I thought. Ignore what I said about Johannes, he smashed that choreography. It\u2019s time for CATHERINE AND JOHANNES. Their Movie Week dance is the Rumba to \u2018Shallow\u2019 by Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga from a A Star Is Born. Haven\u2019t seen it, looks terrible. DRINK. Also, I have An Opinion (BRACE BRACE): based on the previous two weeks Johannes is falling into the trap that Graziano fell into last year, which is making the dance all about him and not choreographing a routine that makes Catherine the star. Much as I love Johannes, this is a bad strategy that never works. Other than in a zero-talent emergency, pros need to reflect their gloriousness onto the celeb \u2013 Kevin is really good at it, which is why has such a great track record on Strictly. Scores: 6,7,6,7 - a total of 25 for Karim and Amy. Motsi though Karim had all the right moves, and Karim had precise footwork. Shirley thought the solo bits were great, but the Samba sections weren\u2019t up to scratch. Bruno thought it was the cutest, cuddliest Samba ever, but it felt a bit spiky. Craig liked how sharp and clean it was, but it needed more natural bounce. OK what is happening please? Karim looks like a cat in flares, whilst Amy is a tiger in heels. Karim\u2019s footwork is great, but this is some kind of fever dream where animals have sexy latin fur-clad hips, and I just can\u2019t. Next up it\u2019s KARIM AND AMY! This week they\u2019re dancing the Samba to \u2018Kung Fu Fighting\u2019 by Carl Douglas from Kung Fu Panda. I have not seen (or indeed heard of) this film, and right now the idea of a Samba to Kung Fu Fighting is not something I\u2019m prepared to accept. DRINK. I\u2019m so sorry. I will watch more films. Scores: 4,6,6,6 - a total of 22 for Chris and Karen. Craig didn\u2019t like it, Chris\u2019s chin was forward and he needed to point his toes. Plus a load of other stuff I can\u2019t be arsed to type. Motsi thought it was a huge improvement on last week, and Shirley agrees, but there were some posture issues. Bruno thought Chris had guts and it wasn\u2019t a disaster \u2013 it was a fitting tribute to what the number represents. Karen is dressed in ALL the swans, and Chris scrubs up nicely. This is all rather charming, and it\u2019s nice from Chris \u2013 a few posture and footwork issues but generally he\u2019s coming on leaps and bounds. One to watch this series, he could be journey of the year. It\u2019s time for CHRIS AND KAREN! This week they\u2019re dancing the American Smooth (Foxtrot version) to \u2018Cheek To Cheek\u2019 by Fred Astaire from Top Hat. I must have seen this film, it\u2019s the kind of thing you watch when you\u2019re sick off school, chugging a bottle of Lucozade under a blanket. Scores - 5,6,6,6 - a total of 23 for Alex and Neil Bruno thought it was a bit hesitant and contained, and Craig agrees \u2013 it was a bit stilted and he wasn\u2019t a fan of the backward roll at the end. Motsi wanted Alex to let go into her hips, it would have been more sensual. Shirley liked the Rumba walks and felt Alex is starting to find her inner woman. Ooh, barefoot Rumba is risky, but Alex looks glorious. It\u2019s lacking flow and some foot pressure and hip action from Alex, and very much one of the less sexy Rumbas we\u2019ve seen (is Neil supposed to be the sea? Or a fish?) but rather magical all the same. Hmm, not sure about that backward roll to finish - would\u2019t get your BAGA 2 for that (ask your mum). Next up It\u2019s ALEX AND NEIL! This week they\u2019re dancing the Rumba to \u2018How Far I\u2019ll Go\u2019 by Auli\u2019I Cravalho from the film Moana. Haven\u2019t seen it, drink. Week 3 Rumba, drink. Cute kids in the VT, drink. Time for the Terms and &amp; Conditions, courtesy of Hollywood legend Hayley Mills. The Parent Trap is one of my fave films ever, but the daughter loves the Lindsey Lohan version. Whatever. Scores: 8,9,9,9 - a total of 35 for Michelle and Giovanni, and three drinks! Shirley though it was magnifique and absolutely brilliant. Bruno thought it was a showstopper of divine decadence, and Michelle kept the actual Quickstep incredibly refined. Craig noticed an extra step, but the rest was A-MAY-ZING. Motsi wasn\u2019t disappointed \u2013 great posture and footwork, and Michelle owned it. I\u2019ve decided I really like Tess\u2019s dress. It\u2019s rather gorgeous. OMG Michelle looks incredible, and Giovanni makes an excellent emcee. Michelle is owning this dancefloor, and her Quickstep footwork looks pretty good. Quite a lot out of hold so not a much actual Quickstep as we might have liked, but incredible showmanship and hugely entertaining. LOVED that. First up tonight It\u2019s MICHELLE AND GIOVANNI! This week they\u2019re dancing the Quickstep to \u2018Cabaret\u2019 by Liza Minelli from the film Cabaret, which I have not seen so DRINK. Also technically this is a Musical, thus making a mockery of Musicals Week. Still, I am very much here for a Michelle/Liza crossover. Out come the stars! This is quite the selection of costumes \u2013 most worrying is Mike Bushell in a fireman\u2019s outfit. That\u2019s clearly coming off, and I have no idea what\u2019s underneath. TESS AND CLAUDIA DRESS WATCH: Tess in a vast rainbow curtain, Claudia in a one-shouldered bin bag that looks like she\u2019s put her head in the wrong hole. Meanwhile Motsi has gone full Disney princess. Ooh, a bonus feem week pro dance! This one kicks off an Incredibles theme, because that\u2019s a film. There\u2019s a lot of pants-over-tights action, including Anton. My EYES. We\u2019ve switched to Disney\u2019s Up, including the most environmentally questionable quantity of balloons ever. And now it\u2019s Toy Story, including Aljaz\u2019s Woody. Insert joke of choice here. Goodness, I\u2019m already exhausted. That must have taken AGES to film. And we\u2019re off! It\u2019s Movie Week, in case you hadn\u2019t noticed. This week\u2019s show is introduced by a Voiceover Man who sounds like he\u2019s gargling peanuts. Tonight\u2019s Strictly Come Bingo Movie Night Special Edition! A slurp from your 16oz booze megabucket for every occurrence of the following: A dance representing a movie I haven\u2019t seen, whether you\u2019ve seen it or not.

Despite us saying every year that Week 3 is far too soon for a theme, they\u2019ve emptied out the BBC prop department once again for MOVIE WEEK. I find it helps to embrace it in the way you would a blockbuster film you\u2019ve been really looking forward to that turns out to be a bit of a hot mess. I\u2019ve updated Heidi\u2019s Hunches below \u2013 human canoe James Cracknell has gone (boo), and I\u2019ve moved Emma W down a group; she\u2019s positively regal in floaty ballroom but I have a feeling that Latin and character-led dances are going to let her down. Happy to be proved wrong. Group 1: driving for December \u2013 Kelvin and Oti, Michelle and Giovanni, Karim and Amy, Dev and Dianne, Saffron and AJ Group 2: battling for Blackpool \u2013 Emma B and Anton, Alex and Neil, Catherine and Johannes, Will and Janette Group 3: happy to see Halloween \u2013 Chris and Karen, Mike and Katya, Emma W and Aljaz Group 4: dodging the dance-off \u2013 David and Nadiya, Anneka and Kevin As usual I\u2019ll be following all the lights, camera and action up here, dressed in a full Grace Kelly get-up*.

      "bodyText": "Prince Harry\u2019s legal action against newspaper publishers over phone-hacking is likely to take a year to come to court, it has emerged, as pressure builds over the tabloids\u2019 treatment of the royal family. His decision to join group litigation launched by others who have said they were victims of phone-hacking came shortly after his wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, sued the publisher of the Mail on Sunday for disclosing a handwritten letter she had sent to her estranged father. In Harry\u2019s lawsuit the publishers of the Mirror, Sun and now defunct News of the World are to face allegations in court that evidence of misconduct has been concealed and destroyed, according to members of Hacked Off, the campaign group that works closely with victims of what it terms \u201cpress abuse\u201d. Such claims are being repeatedly raised in the phone-hacking cases currently before the courts. Senior executives of what was then News International were cleared in 2014 of perverting the course of justice. News Group Newspapers, publisher of the Sun and the now defunct News of the World, has confirmed that a claim has been issued against it by the prince. Reach Plc, which now owns the Daily Mirror, is also aware that proceedings have been issued. Hugh Tomlinson QC, chairman of Hacked Off, told the Guardian that the case illustrated the need to re-open the uncompleted Leveson inquiry. \u201cPrince Harry\u2019s case reminds us of the scale of wrongdoing by certain newspapers which went on over many years,\u201d Tomlinson said. \u201cHacked Off has long campaigned for part two of the Leveson inquiry to find out what actually happened. This reminds us of the need for that. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting that the action brought by the Duchess of Sussex reminds us that the press misconduct, which newspapers have said is a thing of the past, is still continuing. It emphasises the urgent need for an inquiry.\u201d Prince Harry\u2019s phone-hacking action was first reported by the Byline Investigates website, which has been monitoring what is known as the mobile telephone voicemail interception litigation (MTVIL) that is being managed by Mr Justice Mann in the chancery division of the high court. Because there are so many claims against Newsgroup Newspapers and Mirror Group Newspapers the cases have been joined together and are being heard in regular batches. Most are settled out of court through payments; the prince\u2019s claims are not expected to come to trial, if they reach court, until next October at the earliest. Many familiar faces from the phone-hacking inquiry are likely to face questions again about their past role. In December 2015, Alison Saunders, then the director of public prosecutions, said that after studying files submitted by police, in relation to corporate liability at News Group Newspapers and against 10 individuals at Mirror Group Newspapers for alleged phone hacking, she had decided to cease pursuing criminal investigations against Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News UK, and against Piers Morgan and other former editors at Mirror Group Newspapers. The solicitor understood to be representing Prince Harry in the latest phone-hacking claims did not comment. Responding to the duchess\u2019s legal claim, the Mail on Sunday has defended its publication of a private letter to her father. The newspaper carried a report quoting Thomas Markle, 75, the duchess\u2019s estranged father, saying he had not intended to share a private letter sent by her but felt pressured to do so after he was \u201cmischaracterised\u201d in a magazine article. The retired lighting director said he was \u201cdevastated\u201d when it was first mentioned publicly in the American magazine. He said: \u201cI decided to release parts of the letter because of the article from Meghan\u2019s friends \u2026 I have to defend myself. I only released parts of the letter because other parts were so painful. The letter didn\u2019t seem loving to me. I found it hurtful.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 7 October 2019 to clarify that the claim is against News Group Newspapers, publisher of the Sun and the now defunct News of the World.",

      "bodyText": "Thanks all for your company \u2013 enjoy what\u2019s left of the weekend. Cheerio. Anyway, the 2019 World Athletics Championships are in the books. They were, unfortunately, a curious mix of sportswashing, empty stands and drug cheats \u2013 along with all the usual brilliance. I really, really hope athletics can sort itself out, because it really, really doesn\u2019t need to be this way \u2013 and the sport really, really can\u2019t afford for it to be. That British drop, dearie me. Yousif set off too early, missed the baton and grabbed Harris\u2019 hand, down Harris went and that was that. As it goes, they weren\u2019t on for a medal or getting close, but of course they\u2019ve plenty of professional pride so it\u2019s going to sting. Another humungous win for USA, who just have such ludicrous strength in depth. Jamaica take silver and Belgium the bronze. Jamaica close on USA, but the USA pull away down the home straight and suddenly, after the final change, the lead is enormous! They change again, and USA lead Jamaica ... and GB, who weren\u2019t anywhere near anything, drop the baton. USA change first, and as the stagger unwinds, they lead by three metres from Jamaica. BANG! It\u2019s a pretty even break - Jamaica lead, perhaps. Down they go... The start list: Great Britain France USA Jamaica Colombia Belgium Italy Trinidad &amp; Tobago Down go the lights! Everything I think about right and wrong has been consumed by lasers. I think there\u2019s a fair chance USA win it. So, eyes down for the final event of the meet: the men\u2019s 4x400m relay, which gets underway in three minutes or so. Poland take the silver and Jamaica the bronze \u2013 that\u2019s a massive oversight from Sharika Jackson, who went off far too quickly on the anchor. Great Britain finish fourth. GB\u2019s Nielsen attacks but Poland hang on ... and pass Jamaica! USA take the baton and the lead is vast; Sharika Jackson of Jamaica moves into second. USA are miles in front now, with Poland, GB and Jamaica contesting the minor medals. USA lead as they break, Poland and GB chasing \u2013 but five or six metres down. Jamaica are fourth, but have plenty on the last two legs. Phyllis Francis of USA looks strong down the back straight, and she storms ahead around the top bend! She hands over a second or two in front... They\u2019re down ... and they\u2019re away! The light show is going, and has persuaded me to forget absolutely everything but it. So clever! The women are out for the 4x4. The start list: Belgium Netherlands Jamaica Great Britain Poland USA Ukraine Canada Kirt of Estonia takes silver and Vetter of Germany takes bronze. It\u2019s worth noting that Peters had two throws longer than anyone else\u2019s which tells you what a great win this is. The women\u2019s 4x400m is off in 10 minutes, as we see poor Magnus Kurt diddle his shoulder, falling after release. He should still be good for the silver, which is fair consolation. Grenada\u2019s Anderson Peters still leads the javelin into the fifth round - he actually extended it by 20cm in round four. Keni Harrison says she\u2019s pleased an American won, and she\u2019s pleased to get her first medal at a major championships. It must be odd to be the world record holder but not have anything to show for it, so well done her. That\u2019s our final individual race of the championships. The 4x4s to come. Ali got quicker through the competition, whereas Williams ran slower than in her semi. It would\u2019ve taken something special to beat Ali here, though Williams\u2019 PB is 0.02 quicker than her winning time. Harrison takes second in 12.46s and Williams third in 12.47s! What a run from Ali! She gave birth to a son in June 2018 \u2013 with Andre De Grasse, noch \u2013 and here she is! ...and Williams fades as Harrison passes her too! Williams gets out well but Nia Ali closes... They\u2019re stretching on the line ... and they\u2019re down... Back to the hurdles, Williams will win if she gets a better start than in the semi. Harrison can beat her if she runs well, but the form isn\u2019t with her. Bekh-Romanchuk of Ukraine takes silver and Brume of Nigeria bronze. That wasn\u2019t close or even close to close. Here comes Bekh-Romanchuk ... her last go to snaffle the gold from Mihambu... Thinking about those two men\u2019s finals we\u2019ve seen, Cheruiyot did exactly what he wanted to do and it worked; Cheptegei did too, except it didn\u2019t have quite the desired effect on the rest, and he won anyway. Brilliant from both. Mikhambo is still miles ahead in the women\u2019s long jump, where Bekh-Romanchuk of Ukraine has just moved into second place. We\u2019ve got the final of the women\u2019s 100m hurdles coming up in 15. That was a brilliant run! He didn\u2019t want Kejelcha on his shoulder, but when that happened anyway, he ran a brilliant line on the curve, forcing his man to go around him and he couldn\u2019t! So it\u2019s bronze for Ethiopia, and Kipruto of Kenya takes bronze. Cheptegei holds it down, and it\u2019s down to him and Kejelcha! Kejelcha tries, but he can\u2019t get around Cheptegei! Cheptegei puts it in and Kejelcha of Ethiopia, who\u2019s been so quiet, is on his shoulder at the bell! This is so fast, and Cheptegei can\u2019t let Kejelcha past! Cheptegei takes it up; surely he\u2019s going to attack? Mande has been dropped, but Kwemoi, who looked spent, is back! We\u2019ve 800m to go! Kwizera of Burundi moves to the front, but Kipruto is having no such thing, so back he goes, Three laps to go... 8000m gone, and Ahmed and Lomong are struggling - the leaders are going to drop them unless the pace eases, winding up for the finish. Kwemoi, Kipruto and Cheptegei swap the lead - there are five behind them. We nipped off to see not much in the javelin, but it\u2019s still the two Kenyans who lead from Cheptegei and suddenly it\u2019s not so relaxing anymore. The main group is stretching out. They\u2019re running at roughly 27 minute pace, and Kipruto still leads \u2013 but only nominally. Kipruto and Kwemoi move to the front, and the pace is still pretty hectic at 4400m. It\u2019s impossible to know what\u2019s going to happen because all of the leading bunch look like they\u2019ve got plenty left. It\u2019s slowed again now, Cheptegei in front. He looks happy. Back in the 10,000m Kipruto of Kenya has decided that they\u2019re not suffering enough, so he goes to the front and injects some calming pace. Kurt of Estonia has taken the lead in the javelin with 83.95m, but Peters of Grenada immediately betters it with 86.69m. Cheptegei looks extremely chilled \u2013 or chill as we have to say these days. I\u2019m not sure if Mande is setting the pace for him, or is doing his own thing. The first lap is a quick one, Mande then Cheptegei at the front. Mande of Uganda goes to the front, with Belihu of Ethiopia behind him. Bang! The men warm up for the 10,000m, which sounds a bit odd, given how hot it is here in Qatar. We\u2019re now allowed to see that Mihambo jump, and I can confirm that it was an absolute monster. Time\u2019s up! Mihambo charges down the runway and takes it off the set! She lands at 7.30m, and I\u2019d be staggered if that wasn\u2019t enough for gold. She had a little chat with her coach after her previous effort and it did the trick. Back to Cheruiyot though, that was such a run \u2013 a proper unfurling of le smack. He knew he was miles better than the rest and ran a race that was beyond all of them. Next we\u2019ve got the final of the men\u2019s javelin, and on the track the men\u2019s 10,000m - that gets going on the hour, and should be a blast. Yomif Kejelcha of Ethiopia is favourite, but Joshua Cheptegei of Uganda will fancy it too. Back in the sandpit, Brume still leads; Bekh-Romanchuk is second and Rotaru third, of Ukraine and Romania respectively. Irozuru of Great Britain is third, and Mikhambo is seventh. Jake Wightman of Great Britain was fifth, and he ran well; perhaps if he\u2019d focused on this, he\u2019d have had enough to snaffle a medal. That\u2019s a brilliant run, an absolute deconstruction of the field! He led from gun to tape, and was more than two second ahead of Makhloufi of Algeria, who got silver; Lewandowski of Poland took bronze. Cheruiyot pounds round the top bend, and makloufi is second... Cheruiyot leads by miles at the bell! Cheruiyot goes away! Will the others let him take gold and fight for the the minor medals? The others decide to decide: do they allow the Kenyans to run their own race? The first lap is a quickie, 55s I think, and it\u2019s the two out front with a five metre lead. Centrowitz is third, but the gap is increasing now; the plan, it is reckoned, is for a slower third lap, then a sprint finish. Cheruiyot and Kwemoi, his team-mate, get to the front straight away to control the pace. Off we go! Anyone else miss Tom McKean getting boxed and Peter Elliott sneaking a surprise medal? Mihambo has taken her second jump, though BBC decided what we needed to see was people warming up. She fouled. The 12 men who\u2019ll give us the 1500m final are on the track: Great Britain has three Scots representing, Josh Kerr, Neil Gourley and Jake Wightman. None of them are getting close to Kenya\u2019s Timothy Cheruiyot. I should add, all the competitors get three jumps, the top eight get three more, and then there\u2019s a re-rank after five with whoever leads at that point going last. We\u2019ve got the final of the men\u2019s 1500m at 5.40pm, but in the meantime, Brume increases her lead to 6.91m. Mihambo, who\u2019s up shortly, needs something and she knows it. And here she comes, with proper pace down the runway, but leaps from well before the board and ends up with 6.52m. That puts her sixth, behind Ese Brume of Nigeria, who leads with 6.83m; Abigail Irozuru of GB is third with 6.64m. The women\u2019s long jump final is just about to get going; Germany\u2019s Malaika Mihambo is the favourite. So our finalists, in semi-final time order: Williams JAM Ali USA Amusan NIG Harrison USA Brown JAM Tapper JAM Vargas CRC Visser NED The medals will be decided at 6.50pm UK time. Away first time and Janeek Brown leads, but Amusan runs her down! She wins in 12.48 and Brown is second in 12.62; Vargas, of Costa rica is third in 12.65 and she moves into the final too, likewise Visser. poor old Anna Zagre of Belgium fell after clattering the final hurdle, but bounced along the track to snatch fifth spot. Nigeria\u2019s Tobi Amusan is quickest out of these, but this is the weakest of the heats. They\u2019re pretty much ready for the third semi. Cindy Ofili, of Great Britain, comes sixth in 12.95 - she lost her balance just after halfway, which cost her. Yanique Thompson of Jamaica is third in 12.80, good news for Visser. First time away and Megan Tapper of Jamaica gets off very well, but Harrison runs her down and those are the two, Harrison in 12.58 and Tapper in 12.61. Right, off we go with the second heat; Kendra Harrison of USA is the quickest in the race, and she\u2019ll fancy herself for a medal at the very least. While we wait for the second race, I\u2019m going to think about how much I\u2019d like to go to Jamaica, immediately. Not many places can compare when it comes the holiday mix of scenery, culture, people, beaches, food and drink. Nadine Visser of Netherlands was third in 12.62 - she\u2019ll have to wait and see. Williams and Nia Ali cross the line together, Williams just in front - 12.41 versus 12.44. Two to qualify by right, then the two fastest losers from the three heats... Hi friends! We\u2019ve got the semis of the women\u2019s 100m hurdles coming up; the first lot are on the track, and Jamaica\u2019s Danielle Williams, the favourite, is among them. On a less uplifting note, the editorial from today\u2019s Observer: And here\u2019s our report from the midnight marathon, where Callum Hawkins finished fourth: We\u2019ve got just about half an hour until three heats of semi-finals separate the best women\u2019s hurdlers from the rest. In the meantime, treat yourself to a recap of yesterday evening\u2019s high drama: Hello and welcome to our coverage of the final day of what\u2019s been a rollercoaster championships in Doha. Yesterday saw Laura Muir declare that a \u201ccloud\u201d hung over an ostensibly stunning 1500m victory by Sifan Hassan, before Dina Asher-Smith stole the headlines once again with a historic third medal in the 4x100 relay \u2013 with the men\u2019s team also taking silver. Today kicks off with the women\u2019s 100m hurdle semi-final before we move on to a series of pulse-racing finals \u2013 namely the women\u2019s long jump and 100m hurdles, and the men\u2019s 1500m, javelin and 10,000m. All that, plus a pair of 4x400m relay finals to finish it all off. Stay tuned!",

The football is turgid, and goals are hard to find. Yes, take your pick of which of Newcastle United and Manchester United that refers to. The cap fits both of them. The days when this was one of the grandest fixtures in the Premier League have receded as far as Alan Shearer\u2019s hairline. Steve Bruce was club captain of Manchester United when this pairing met in March 1996 and Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r was just a glint in the eye of Alex Ferguson\u2019s scouting department. Today\u2019s managers were never Old Trafford colleagues, with Bruce shipped out in the 1996 summer the \u2018little Norwegian\u2019, as he became known, arrived in Manchester. They are, though, both favourite sons of Fergie and both have admitted to seeking advice from the grand old man. <br><br>Their teams have much to improve on. Newcastle\u2019s 5-0 pummelling at Leicester was relegation writ large. For Manchester United, Monday\u2019s draw with Arsenal was perhaps the lowest-amped match ever between another pair of fallen giants while that 0-0 draw with AZ Alkmaar was the football equivalent of being locked in a room with only a long read on protein shakes for company. <br><br>And so a classic cannot be expected but then again, this is the best league in the world. <br><br><strong>Kick-off: 4.30pm BST</strong> </p> \n </div> \n</div>",

You need your team and your staff to rally round. When you get beat everybody comes under the pump. For a young kid to come in and smash one in is something else. Since China, I have said \u2018who is this kid?\u2019 He plays with enthusiasm, he lights up our day. David de Gea speaks and he looks dumbfounded. Everything, a lot of things to improve. I don\u2019t know what to say. Keep fighting, keep fighting, it\u2019s a difficult moment for us. Probably, it\u2019s the most difficult time since I have been here. I don\u2019t know what is happening. We cannot score a goal in two games. We have to say sorry to the fans. Not just this game, this whole season but let\u2019s keep fighting and keep working. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s post-match interview was a little wide-eyed and included plenty of rambling. Some edited highlights. We lacked a few key players but that is no excuse. At the moment, we are in a position we are not used to. It\u2019s symptomatic of where we are at. We work hard and we don\u2019t create. Luckily, it\u2019s the international break. We have time to analyse. Hopefully, we will get some some players back. It\u2019s my responsibility and I need to sort their heads out. They are human beings, young footballers who all work hard. We want to see those results. Rashford is working hard. He is running, running, running and not getting the service. The first half was the worst we have played. The second we dominated, and we don\u2019t get the win. We have six out from the starting XI against Chelsea...we have come together and decided the direction, if you work on sunny days you will never get to where you are going. Here\u2019s Louise Taylor\u2019s match report. \u201cSolskjaer, Pochetino, whoever - it makes no difference who\u2019s in charge of Utd while their wage structure rewards mediocrity to such an outrageous degree,\u201d says Sean King. \u201cDavid Moyes is available,\u201d says Nick Smith. The brothers Longstaff speak and they cannot stop smiling. Matty Longstaff: Bit in awe, to be honest. I am over the moon and bit speechless. Sean Longstaff: I am over the moon for him. He\u2019s been unlucky not to be in the team to be honest. He\u2019s been the best player in training since pre-season. I couldn\u2019t be happier. ML: I found out yesterday. He read out my name and the butterflies began to go off. SL: He makes my life easier. He was a lot quieter than normal. He deserves all the credit he\u2019s going to get. ML: It was hit and hope to be honest. I can\u2019t really describe it, I just ran to the fans. To get that in front of the Gallowgate End makes it more special. SL: It\u2019s been a tough week in training. That\u2019s us grafting, that\u2019s how we are going to be successful. Here come the stats. Howay the lad. Steve Bruce actually took a while to break into a smile there but did so in the end. The drought is over against his old club. It looks like he is getting the better advice from Sir Alex Ferguson. Newcastle are 16th, and Manchester United are 12th, just a point above their conquerors. Crisis? Oh yes, this is a crisis. Those who want Solskj\u00e6r given time are probably going against the tide at this point. And there has to be the thought that he might not want to stick around himself. That\u2019s it, Newcastle have done it. What a day for Steve Bruce, what a day for Matty Longstaff, who was superb even before his goal. Manchester United were dreadful, again, and the Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r romance is all but dead. Will he be in charge by the time United play Liverpool on October 20th? 90+4 min: A Krafth handball gifts a set-piece chance to United. Pereira takes after a tussle in the box. De Gea goes up for it. And Pereira hooks it high and into Dubravka\u2019s arms. 90+2 min: Fred loops up a long ball but Rashford is no Andy Carroll. Yedlin excitedly runs down the other end, and loses the ball. But do Manchester United have what it takes to hurt them? 90+1 min: Where are the wave upon waves of Manchester United attacks in this circumstance? Way back in the past by the looks of this game and many others over the last six years. 90 min: Final Newcastle sub. Almiron slopes off and on comes Emile Krafth. There will be four minutes to be added on. 89 min: Matty Longstaff and Scott McTominay get involved and the debutant looks pure radge as he confront someone six inches taller. 88 min: Marcus Rashford\u2019s body language is meanwhile desolate. He has not been lucky enough to play in a good United team and he is not receiving much service as a young player but he looks like someone shrinking under the responsibility. 87 min: Ole gesticulating wildly on the touchline and his reactions suggest he is not happy with the responses he is receiving. 86 min: Final Manchester United sub. On comes Tahith Chong for Ashley Young. Who takes United\u2019s free-kicks now? 84 min: Newcastle sat back, with even Andy Carroll sat deep. This has turned into a game of attack versus defence. Or to put it properly, a slightly shaky defence against a blunt instrument of an attack. Greenwood\u2019s header is saved easily by Dubravka. 83 min: Newcastle sub: Saint-Maximin for Atsu, who will be expected to replicate his predecessor\u2019s hard running. 82 min: Free-kick to United in dangerous position, though, on the edge of the box. Pereira hits the wall and then poor Fred makes a mess of his attempt to get a shot in. 80 min: Fred is jeered as he launches a shot that lands somewhere in the Jesmond area of Tyneside. United have been aimless and hopeless, even more so after the goal went in. 79 min: Rashford, who looks anything less than his free-spirited best, plays a terrible ball into the area. Remember that aimless hoof by Victor Lindelof the other night? Think that, but not by someone attempting to clear his lines. Oh dear. 78 min: Marcos Rojo, as is customary, has been booked for a piece of foul play. 77 min: Newcastle confident now. Sean Longstaff shoots from distance but is not quite as deadly as his brother. David de Gea saves with ease. 75 min: Oh Ole, what can you find now? Maguire, somewhat culpable in the goal, drives the ball forward. Ashley Young attempts a cross from the flank, but Mason Greenwood cannot get on the end of of it. 73 min: The brothers Longstaff had been struggling in midfield for a few minutes but the younger brother stepped up there. Remember, he hit the bar earlier. United wanted brother Sean in the summer; do they want both now? Mike Ashley will be only too happy to name his price. 72 min: Saint-Maximin ran deep into United territory, and then Willems makes space with some neat skill and a pass that tees up Longstaff minor to drill home. What a story, what a goal.... 71 min: Rashford had the goal begging from a fine piece of James play but Schar manages to get the ball away. Just. United win another corner to follow that. Young hits Maguire again but the header is askew. 69 min: Greenwood almost plays Young in, but the choice of cross rather than shot allows Newcastle to clear. Saint-Maximin\u2019s run to the other end of the field causes mild panic before it\u2019s overrun. Space opening up now for both teams. 68 min: Newcastle still back in numbers when United attack. Fred in particular seems bamboozled by having so many defenders in front of him. However, the home team are edging back, and inviting pressure. 66 min: Almiron booked for diving over a tackle by Rojo. Did he learn that in The MLS? Meanwhile, a Manchester United change sees Mason Greenwood come on for Juan Mata. 65 min: Carroll nods over. Yedlin\u2019s cross finds the centre of the box and Tuanzebe read the run well and put the big man off. 63 min: The game has opened up a little since that Carroll arrival. It\u2019s a move that suggests that Bruce fancies sneaking a win and opens the route to a United goal, too. Not that their forwards look capable of doing much, save perhaps for Daniel James. 61 min: That means Tuanzebe is playing full-back, which is not much of a franking of Ole\u2019s belief in the youngster. Having said that, Dalot is reported as injured. Another muscle injury. All that sweat in the Far East and Asia doesn\u2019t seem to have done much for United\u2019s sick bay. 60 min: On comes Marcos Rojo for Diogo Dalot, which doesn\u2019t look like an injury-enforced change. Tactical to deal with Carroll? It looks like it as Rojo is immediately on the local hero\u2019s shoulder. 58 min: United chance! Pereira whips in a ball from the left and Daniel James cannot get there as Willems just manages to put him off. 57 min: The first missile is launched by Willems at Carroll as Maguire manages to get the ball clear. Every time the ball comes close to Carroll, the Toon Army\u2019s volume increases. 56 min: Here comes Plan B, here comes Andy Carroll, on as a sub for Joelinton. Here is a test for Maguire and especially Tuanzebe. 55 min: Young takes, as dead-ball \u2018expert\u2019 and the target is again Maguire. Newcastle get it away, somewhat chaotically and then Daniel James\u2019 shot is blocked. 53 min: Rashford\u2019s defection to the left means Manchester United have nobody in the centre when the likes of James, Dalot and Young get the ball. James and Dalot, though, force a corner. 51 min: Marcus Rashford looking a little tentative in his movement. He has begun the half in an inside left position, so as to get on his right foot. Jose Mourinho has been at pains to point out he has only one foot. 49 min: Ashley Young is down, having taken a second bang to the head of this game. Mike Dean decides on a drop ball as Pereira disputes that decision. Newcastle play on, having decided not to be sportsmanlike. Oh well, game\u2019s gone. 47 min: A booking for Schar for what was a deliberate handball after a Rashford run. Almiron, who was also pulling the Longsight flier\u2019s shirt, is soon given a chance to make his own run but shoots wide. It is beginning to look like he left his radar in The MLS. 46 min: The second half is underway and Mata is clearly being pushed up close to Marcus Rashford, who was a bystander to the first half. The Blaydon Races ring out and the teams take to the field once more. Gary Naylor again: \u201cIs it wrong to think of Juan Mata as a loyal gundog who can no longer deliver the prey to the rifle (or whatever it is they do) and now needs a happy retirement gambolling after butterflies in a lush meadow? He\u2019s only 31, but seems nearer 40 somehow.\u201d Gavin Reddin writes: \u201cI know Ole has little to work with at the moment, but surely the 11 he\u2019s put out are better than the 11 Newcastle have put out and yet they\u2019ve been dire. Do you think a top-class manager, a Conte, say, would get a better song out of this group?\u201d You would have to say so. Poor Ole\u2019s suffered in terms of tactics and it seems these days that motivation is a problem. And Robert Darby has some harsh words: \u201cIs this too early in the season to call this a relegation 6 pointer, or am I doing a disservice to ... Newcastle?\u201d A quick glance at the first-half highlights pinpoints how well the Longstaff brothers have played today. Manchester United\u2019s midfield, save for perhaps McTominay, has been peripheral. There was some actually quite exciting Premier League football today... Gary Naylor asks: \u201cIt\u2019s a long time since I read any Asterix but weren\u2019t Longstaff, Longstaff and Saint-Maximin all friends of Obelix?\u201d Getafix, oh druid etc etc. \u201cWhy on earth don\u2019t the Longstaff brothers have the first letter of their first name on the back of their shirts along with their surname?\u201d asks JR in Illinois. \u201cI guess ultimately it doesn\u2019t matter that much as one can\u2019t read the lettering or even see the number against the black and white stripe background on the back of the Newcastle shirt. A point of interest, when Gerard Deulofeu was on Everton he had \u201cG. Deulofeu\u201d on the back of his shirt and I always wondered why as there were no other Deulofeus around.\u201d They exchanged decent chances at the end of the half, with Maguire going closest, but this has been an even contest in which Newcastle had been the team who looked like they were getting what they wanted out of the game. Steve Bruce still has a chance of getting a first ever win over his old club. And, frankly, he might not get many better chances than this Manchester United team. 45 min: Two minutes of time added on in this half. 44 min: A scare for Newcastle. Two of them, in fact. Dalot\u2019s ball is hurriedly cleared behind Schar. Young\u2019s corner is excellent and Harry Maguire\u2019s slab head was on the end of it. Somehow, he missed. 43 min: Nice skill by James beats Willems but he finds himself with little support. 42 min: Better from Fred, as he stops Willems being able to cut inside and launch a shot in the fashion he did against Liverpool a few weeks ago. 41 min: Manchester United\u2019s attempts to carve a shooting chance have been woeful, which is testament to the excellence of Newcastle\u2019s defending, but Maguire steps up and plays in Pereira, who releases what must be the first shot of the game from United. Dubravka, though, had no trouble dealing with it. 39 min: Manchester United attempt to work a passing move, and it results in a pass from Fred that was to nobody. Daniel James and Marcus Rashford had not read his mind...and up the other end, Almiron almost escaped, but Harry Maguire came across to stop a player who is not exactly brimming with confidence in front of goal. Danger averted. 37 min: Poor pass from Tuanzebe finds Longstaff Major, whose ball to Joelinton allows Tuanzebe chance to redeem himself with some calm, collected defending. 35 min: Saint-Maximin continues to cause trouble. He wins a corner that results in not much more than a collision between Young and Schar, with both requiring treatment that seems to be enough to revive them. 33 min: Long ball looped up to Juan Mata, and he cannot get to the ball. He is not a man to launch it to. Fred receives an admonishment for choosing that option. 32 min: Newcastle are the better team here, make no mistake. And they aren\u2019t having to play brilliantly to be so. 30 min: Yellow card for McTominay, as he catches Longstaff Major with a trailing boot that was a little high. That was an orange card, if we are truthful. It is VAR-ed, and McTominay escapes having the first squeeze of Pantene. 29 min: Oof, close, as Schar runs on to a corner and flicks it over the bar. Newcastle have had by far the better chances. And their gameplan is working much better, too. 28 min: Matty Longstaff hits the bar! Saint-Maximim plays in a short pass and he lashes a shot that had De Gea beaten. That was almost a dream debut. 27 min: Corner to MUFC, taken again by Young and it drifts into the air and into Dubravka\u2019s hands. It was meat and drink to the Newcastle keeper. 25 min: Maguire steps across to stop Joelinton in his tracks and pulls up afterwards. Let\u2019s see how he is after that. Ashley Young, at the other end, forces a decent defensive header from Ciaran Clark. 24 min: Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r looks pensive, and is attempting to direct traffic. 23 min: Another free-kick for a foul on James. Young takes again and it is headed clear. United\u2019s set piece record is atrocious, the worst in the Premier League, without a goal from one in over 200 days. 22 min: Harry Maguire is seeing an awful lot of the ball, operating as a Koeman-esque playmaker but with worse teammates. His pass to James sees the winger turn Schar and win a free-kick. Young takes it from a deep position by the touchline. It goes straight to Dubravka. 20 min: Rashford gets chance for a sprint but across comes Lascelles to stop that. United then take an age over a throw-in. Back in those 1990s glory days, they used to speed such moments up. Rarely did they ever not take a free-kick short and keep going but this is a very different team, and one with no obvious confidence in itself. 18 min: Newcastle attack breaks down but United fail to break at any speed. Too much traffic to get through. 17 min: A United passing move comes to naught, as Juan Mata strays offside. McTominay was the player driving it on as he appears to be do much of the time these days. He is flourishing, but what is he rising above? Not much, it has to be said. 15 min: Instead, Yedlin gets a yellow card for a flying challenge on McTominay. No complaints there, not even from the American. 14 min: Daniel James brings down Yedlin after the full-back is released by Longstaff Minor. The home fans call for a yellow but don\u2019t get it. 13 min: Midfield is a morass of bodies. And that\u2019s the way Brucey wants it. 11 min: Maguire steps forward, Fred spreads play to Dalot but Willems clears the danger. Newcastle have men back in numbers. A long launched ball to Joelinton almost results in a flick to Saint-Maximin, but the ball gets back to De Gea. That would appear to be the pattern of play. Saint-Maximin looks liveliest and has a shot from long range that goes wide. 9 min: Newcastle\u2019s fast start has slowed up and they are prepared to sit back. Steve Bruce\u2019s aim appears to be denying Marcus Rashford and Daniel James space. When David de Gea booms a goal kick long and out of play, it is a reflection of a tepid start. 7 min: The away fans are singing of Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r and 1999. They obviously don\u2019t want to forget the 1990s even if he is now trying to. Matty Longstaff, by the way, has started the game brightly, and is very similar to his brother if perhaps a little more ruddy of complexion. 5 min: Newcastle\u2019s 5-4-1 has flooded the midfield and allowed the visitors space to play the ball around. This season, they have not been much of a team for flowing passing moves that pull their opponents apart. 3 min: More danger for MUFC, as Fred fouls Almiron, and gets a very quick booking. The resultant free-kick is cleared readily enough but the home team and very much on the front foot. 1 min: The weather has been rotten, by the way, and Manchester United are already under pressure, with Saint-Maximin forging deep into their defence before Ashley Young clears the ball. Steve Bruce and Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r exchange a warm embrace, having met at their old boss\u2019s golf days. \u201cHaving brothers together in centre mid is going to get confusing,\u201d says Felix Wood. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with using first names for footballers, so we may have to go with Longstaff and Shortstaff.\u201d The sequence of The Ramones\u2019 Blitzkrieg Bop, Carmina Burana and then the theme from Local Hero means that it\u2019s game time at St James\u2019. Broken up by that Premier League dirge anthem but briefly. Is there a song that finishes as suddenly as Knopfler\u2019s Local Hero, aside maybe from Dennis Waterman\u2019s theme from On The Up? The last brothers to play for Newcastle together were, of course, and actually quite recently, Shola and Sammy Ameobi in September 2014. The Toon Army were left to lament a 3-0 loss to Sunderland that day, Steve Bruce speaks. You had to change something. We have people who haven\u2019t had chance so far, people like Ciaran Clark who trains like every day is his last. [On the Longstaff brothers] There is a wonderful connection there. It\u2019s not often you get brothers playing for the same team. [On Matthew Longstaff] He\u2019s caught my eye with the energy and the way he plays. They have both risen very quickly. Sean did very very well last season. I understand that you don\u2019t get a lot of time but we are seven games in. But we have played four of the top six or seven. You always need a bit of time. Some of the performances have been decent, and we need a big one today. Tuanzebe will play centre-back, his favoured position, with Ashley Young and Diogo Dalot as full-backs. A chance to see how he matches up alongside Harry Maguire. Ole Gunnar speaks. [On Lindel\u00f6f and Lingard] Yes, and both got injuries on Thursday night. It\u2019s part and parcel of the game. Axel [Tuanzebe] is coming in and Diogo [Dalot] is coming in. The plastic pitch locked his [Lindelof\u2019s] back. He travelled with us and he will need a week off. Today is important, as we haven\u2019t had the results we have wanted to. We have to make sure we play with enthusiasm, play as a team. The injuries mean we cannot work on set patterns. My focus is on solutions for this game. The players will come back when they come back. Yes [I Have confidence in Tuanzebe]. He\u2019s been brilliant since pre-season so I am absolutely not worried. Stat attack time. It\u2019s just possible that this will not be seen as the biggest result of the day. And Ole laments that we\u2019re not in the 1990s any more, worse luck. Fergie remains a favoured hotline. Steve Bruce has made the promised changes and gives Matthew Longstaff his debut alongside big brother Sean. Emil Krafth, Paul Dummett, Issac Hayden, Yoshinori Muto and Christian Atsu have been dropped. Longstaff the younger, Ciaran Clark, Allan Saint-Maximim, Jetro Willems and DeAndre Yedlin are given a go. It all looks a bit League Cup, to be quite honest. For both teams. Even allowing for Newcastle\u2019s problems this season, that is not a very strong Manchester United team. Far from it, in fact. Two defenders playing out of position, no Paul Pogba, the enigmatic Fred in midfield and an attack that is youthful yet not exactly dynamic. Newcastle: Dubravka, Clark, Schar, Lascelles, Willems, Yedlin, S Longstaff, M Longstaff, Saint-Maximin, Almiron, Joelinton. Subs: Darlow, Dummett, Carroll, Shelvey, Gayle, Krafth, Atsu. Manchester United: De Gea, Young, Maguire, Dalot, Tuanzebe, Fred, McTominay, Pereira, Mata, James, Rashford. Subs: Romero, Rojo, Greenwood, Gomes, Matic, Chong, Williams. The fans loathe the owner and are not sure of the manager, even though he professes to be one of them, a long-standing lover of their club. The football is turgid, and goals are hard to find. Yes, take your pick of which of Newcastle United and Manchester United that refers to. The cap fits both of them. The days when this was one of the grandest fixtures in the Premier League have receded as far as Alan Shearer\u2019s hairline. Steve Bruce was club captain of Manchester United when this pairing met in March 1996 and Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r was just a glint in the eye of Alex Ferguson\u2019s scouting department. Today\u2019s managers were never Old Trafford colleagues, with Bruce shipped out in the 1996 summer the \u2018little Norwegian\u2019, as he became known, arrived in Manchester. They are, though, both favourite sons of Fergie and both have admitted to seeking advice from the grand old man. Their teams have much to improve on. Newcastle\u2019s 5-0 pummelling at Leicester was relegation writ large. For Manchester United, Monday\u2019s draw with Arsenal was perhaps the lowest-amped match ever between another pair of fallen giants while that 0-0 draw with AZ Alkmaar was the football equivalent of being locked in a room with only a long read on protein shakes for company. And so a classic cannot be expected but then again, this is the best league in the world. Kick-off: 4.30pm BST",

      "bodyText": "Counter-terror police across the UK have been running a secret database containing details of thousands of individuals referred to the government\u2019s controversial anti-radicalisation Prevent programme, the Guardian can reveal. The National Police Prevent Case Management (PCM) database is managed centrally by national counter-terrorism policing headquarters. It is accessible to all police forces across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and the Home Office are able to request data from it, according to documents sent to the human rights group Liberty and seen by the Guardian. The stated aim of Prevent, a voluntary programme, is to divert people from terrorism before they offend and crucially deals with individuals who have yet to cross the criminality threshold. Each Prevent referral received is added to the PCM database by individual police forces, including personal details and reasons for the referral, but the person is not notified, responses to Freedom of Information (FOI) requests submitted by Liberty showed. Other agencies are able to request information held on the database. The revelations about the existence of the database come at a time when Prevent is facing renewed scrutiny as an independent review begins, sparked by years of accusations that the programme had become a toxic brand that disproportionately targeted Muslims. Police chiefs said recording referrals ensured accountability and allowed forces to understand when vulnerabilities are increasing. Gracie Bradley, Liberty policy and campaigns manager, said: \u201cThis secret database isn\u2019t about keeping us safe. It\u2019s about keeping tabs on and controlling people \u2013 particularly minority communities and political activists. \u201cIt is utterly chilling that potentially thousands of people, including children, are on a secret government database because of what they\u2019re perceived to think or believe.\u201d Any rank of police officer or staff can access the database but users must be Prevent practitioners, who are vetted and given training prior to access. Chief constables are the designated data controllers within their respective forces. The exact number of individuals on the database is currently unknown but forces that responded to Liberty\u2019s request for information said all referrals were added at the time of receipt and official statistics show that 21,042 individuals have been referred in the three years to March 2018 alone. In the most recent year available, 2017/18, a total of 7,318 individuals were subject to a referral but 3,096 or 42% left the process requiring no further action and 3,466 left the process and were signposted to alternative services. The majority \u2013 4,144 or 57% \u2013 were aged 20 years or under. Within this figure, 2,009 were under 15 and 2,135 were aged 15 to 20. Ultimately, only 394 were escalated to the Channel process, which provides specialist support to people who were deemed at risk of being drawn into terrorism following a number of assessments. Police Prevent practitioners also have access to the Channel Management Information System which is a database of Prevent Channel cases, the responses said. CMIS is owned and managed by the Home Office. Information on the database is derived from referrals made by public servants like teachers and doctors as well as police, who are compelled to monitor and report signs of what they believe could indicate extremism under a controversial statutory duty. In its response, the Met police said an individual can challenge the decision and have their details removed but the challenge may not always be successful depending on the circumstances. However, the force did not elaborate on how that would be possible given that individuals are not aware their details are entered on the database. Harun Khan, secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, said: \u201cThat a database is being compiled by police forces detailing every Prevent referral is deeply worrying. That it is secret is even more concerning. \u201cThis database \u2013 over and above being a hugely authoritarian tool \u2013 will mean that the vast majority of those referred, who are found to have no terrorism link, will still be perceived as potential risks by the state, and this will disproportionately affect Muslims. \u201cOur questions on transparency, accountability and oversight around Prevent now become even more important.\u201d The independent review of Prevent, announced in January, attracted controversy itself when it emerged the man appointed to lead the exercise, Lord Carlile, had admitted to parliament that he \u201cmay be somewhat biased towards\u201d the programme and had pledged his \u201cconsidered and strong support\u201d to it, prompting calls for him to step down. Further criticism was triggered by the terms of reference for the review, published last month, which suggested the exercise would not \u201cconsider past decisions\u201d made under the programme. Lord Carlile sought to reassure critics by claiming that \u201ceverything is up for discussion, including scrapping\u201d the programme. One of four strands of the government\u2019s counter-terrorism strategy known as Contest, Prevent was created by the Labour government in 2003 and its remit was widened by the coalition government in 2011. The statutory duty on schools, NHS trusts, prisons and local authorities to report concerns about people who may be at risk of turning to extremism or terrorism was introduced in 2015.

      "bodyText": "The unveiling of a secret database holding all referrals to Prevent has sparked a fresh debate over the controversial anti-radicalisation programme. What is Prevent? Prevent is one of the four \u201cPs\u201d of the government\u2019s counter-terrorism strategy, along with Pursue, Protect and Prepare. Prevent was created by the Labour government in 2003 and its remit was widened by the coalition government in 2011. Its stated purpose is to safeguard and support those vulnerable to radicalisation and to stop them from becoming terrorists or supporting terrorism. How does it prevent people from becoming terrorists? Individuals suspected of being vulnerable to radicalisation can be referred to police for further assessment. One of the most controversial aspects of Prevent was the statutory duty introduced in 2015 on schools, NHS trusts, prisons and local authorities to report concerns about people who may be at risk of turning to extremism or terrorism. Once referred, the individual will be assessed to see whether or not further intervention is required. If an individual is assessed to be vulnerable to radicalisation, they may be offered support through the Channel programme in England and Wales, or the Prevent Professional Concerns (PPC) programme in Scotland. This is a voluntary process. Channel is run in every local authority in England and Wales and addresses all types of extremism, including extreme rightwing and Islamist-related. Between 2017 and 2018, a total of 7,318 individuals were subject to a referral but only 394 were escalated to the Channel process. There are other aspects to the Prevent strategy. For example, the strategy says the government seeks to stop the spreading of terrorist material online as well as build counter-terrorist narratives. In 2016, the Guardian revealed the UK government had embarked on a series of clandestine propaganda campaigns intended to bring about \u201cattitudinal and behavioural change\u201d among young British Muslims. Why is Prevent controversial? The most common criticism levelled at the Prevent strategy is that it disproportionately impacts people of Muslim faith or background and inhibits legitimate expression. There have been numerous reports over the last 15 years that have fuelled this perception: an eight-year-old questioned by Prevent after his teachers mistook his T-shirt slogan for Islamic State propaganda, a 17-year-old referred because he wore a \u201cFree Palestine\u201d badge to school and a student of counter-terrorism questioned after an official spotted him reading a textbook entitled Terrorism Studies. The Prevent brand has been labelled \u201ctoxic\u201d in parts of the Muslim community. But senior policing and security figures continue to back Prevent. The UK\u2019s most senior counter-terrorism officer, Neil Basu, vigorously defended the programme in a speech in Israel last month, while security ministers and former home secretaries have insisted it has saved lives.",

      "body": "<h2>Are we finally going to learn this week whether there will be a Brexit deal?</h2> <p>Perhaps. The EU summit starting on 17 October has long been seen as a hard deadline, but EU leaders will not negotiate legal text in the middle of the night and, realistically, for a deal to happen most of the components would have to be in place by next weekend. Emmanuel Macron <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/06/macron-gives-boris-johnson-end-week-overhaul-brexit-plan\">has floated this Friday</a> as a deadline, although No 10 thinks 14 October will in practice be the last possible moment for a deal.</p> <h2>What are the main issues dividing the two sides?</h2> <p>There are two, both relating to Northern Ireland. To avoid a hard border after Brexit, a longstanding goal for both sides, Boris Johnson has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/06/boris-johnson-brexit-border-plan-break-deadlock-analysis\">produced a plan</a> for a new version of the backstop that would keep Northern Ireland in the single market for goods while also keeping it in UK customs territory. This means there would have to be some sort of checks on goods crossing the north/south border. </p> <p>The UK has produced a minimalist blueprint for how these might operate. But the EU is not convinced the plan would work, thinks it would require new infrastructure that would become a terrorist target, and is alarmed that even the UK is admitting the full details would have to be worked out over the next year.</p> <p>The UK plan also involves effectively giving the Democratic Unionist party a veto before these arrangements are introduced, and then every four years when they are renewed. This is unacceptable to the other parties in Northern Ireland and, from the EU\u2019s point of view, means a system designed to protect the integrity of the single market is entirely dependent on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/04/arlene-foster-out-on-her-own-with-history-in-her-hands\">the goodwill of Arlene Foster</a>.</p> <h2>Will there be a deal?</h2> <p>Who knows, but it is not looking likely.</p> <p>On the plus side, Johnson has got the DUP and most of the die-hard Tory Brexiters from the European Research Group to support his plan, which means he is close to having a Commons majority for it. It is also undoubtedly true that a no-deal Brexit would be damaging to both sides, which implies that a compromise should theoretically be possible.</p> <p>But at stake are fundamental issues (essentially, whether it is possible to leave the EU customs union and still have most of the frictionless border advantages of being in), not minor customs technicalities, as Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2019/oct/02/boris-johnsons-speech-to-the-tory-party-conference-annotated\">claimed in his party conference speech</a>. And if the UK were to compromise further, as the EU is demanding, the fragile Tory/DUP coalition that Johnson has assembled behind his plan would start to crumble.</p> <p>Both sides intend to keep talking this week, but that does not necessarily mean they are convinced they can get a deal. The EU does not want to be seen to be pushing a member out (its harsh treatment of Greece during the eurozone crisis was a propaganda bonanza for anti-Europeans). And Johnson wants to be seen to be doing all he can to secure an agreement, to give credibility to claims (already being rehearsed by the Tories) that the EU would be to blame for no deal.</p> <h2>If there is no deal, will the UK leave anyway on 31 October, as Johnson claims, or will the Benn act ensure an extension?</h2> <p>No one knows for sure, although supporters of the act, which will require the PM to \u201cseek to obtain\u201d a three-month Brexit extension under article 50 by 19 October if the government has not passed a deal, believe the legislation is robust.</p> <p>No 10 says Johnson will obey the law. But he has also said he will not resign and would rather be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/05/boris-johnson-rather-be-dead-in-ditch-than-agree-brexit-extension\">\u201cdead in a ditch\u201d</a> than extend Brexit, and his aides have claimed they are considering various unspecified schemes to subvert the act, which cannot guarantee an extension anyway because the EU could always say no (although that is thought unlikely).</p> <p>In practice, this is another matter that could get settled in the supreme court. But it may be significant that in private the PM\u2019s team is now more willing than it was to accept an extension might have to happen. They used to think it would be electoral suicide for the Tories, but now they believe Johnson could win anyway, provided he was seen to have tried to deliver Brexit by the end of October.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Are we finally going to learn this week whether there will be a Brexit deal? Perhaps. The EU summit starting on 17 October has long been seen as a hard deadline, but EU leaders will not negotiate legal text in the middle of the night and, realistically, for a deal to happen most of the components would have to be in place by next weekend. Emmanuel Macron has floated this Friday as a deadline, although No 10 thinks 14 October will in practice be the last possible moment for a deal. What are the main issues dividing the two sides? There are two, both relating to Northern Ireland. To avoid a hard border after Brexit, a longstanding goal for both sides, Boris Johnson has produced a plan for a new version of the backstop that would keep Northern Ireland in the single market for goods while also keeping it in UK customs territory. This means there would have to be some sort of checks on goods crossing the north/south border. The UK has produced a minimalist blueprint for how these might operate. But the EU is not convinced the plan would work, thinks it would require new infrastructure that would become a terrorist target, and is alarmed that even the UK is admitting the full details would have to be worked out over the next year. The UK plan also involves effectively giving the Democratic Unionist party a veto before these arrangements are introduced, and then every four years when they are renewed. This is unacceptable to the other parties in Northern Ireland and, from the EU\u2019s point of view, means a system designed to protect the integrity of the single market is entirely dependent on the goodwill of Arlene Foster. Will there be a deal? Who knows, but it is not looking likely. On the plus side, Johnson has got the DUP and most of the die-hard Tory Brexiters from the European Research Group to support his plan, which means he is close to having a Commons majority for it. It is also undoubtedly true that a no-deal Brexit would be damaging to both sides, which implies that a compromise should theoretically be possible. But at stake are fundamental issues (essentially, whether it is possible to leave the EU customs union and still have most of the frictionless border advantages of being in), not minor customs technicalities, as Johnson claimed in his party conference speech. And if the UK were to compromise further, as the EU is demanding, the fragile Tory/DUP coalition that Johnson has assembled behind his plan would start to crumble. Both sides intend to keep talking this week, but that does not necessarily mean they are convinced they can get a deal. The EU does not want to be seen to be pushing a member out (its harsh treatment of Greece during the eurozone crisis was a propaganda bonanza for anti-Europeans). And Johnson wants to be seen to be doing all he can to secure an agreement, to give credibility to claims (already being rehearsed by the Tories) that the EU would be to blame for no deal. If there is no deal, will the UK leave anyway on 31 October, as Johnson claims, or will the Benn act ensure an extension? No one knows for sure, although supporters of the act, which will require the PM to \u201cseek to obtain\u201d a three-month Brexit extension under article 50 by 19 October if the government has not passed a deal, believe the legislation is robust. No 10 says Johnson will obey the law. But he has also said he will not resign and would rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d than extend Brexit, and his aides have claimed they are considering various unspecified schemes to subvert the act, which cannot guarantee an extension anyway because the EU could always say no (although that is thought unlikely). In practice, this is another matter that could get settled in the supreme court. But it may be significant that in private the PM\u2019s team is now more willing than it was to accept an extension might have to happen. They used to think it would be electoral suicide for the Tories, but now they believe Johnson could win anyway, provided he was seen to have tried to deliver Brexit by the end of October.",

Alex Cobham, chief executive at the Tax Justice Network and a co-author of the study, said: \u201cWe\u2019re concerned the OECD may be fumbling a golden opportunity to lead the world into a new era of equitable international tax rights. \u201cAfter promising the radical shift in international rules that is urgently necessary, the OECD seems to be lapsing back into tinkering at the margins \u2013 doing little to redistribute profits from tax havens, and even less for the lower-income countries that lose the most to corporate tax abuse.\u201d The study relies on aggregate statistics from multinational companies\u2019 country-by-country reporting. Cobham said that the release of that data \u2013 made publicly available only this year after demands for greater transparency \u2013 fell short of what was needed for countries who were signed up to the framework deal to be able to scrutinise the proposals fully. \u201cThey should demand the OECD release its full country-by-country data so that governments can make informed decisions on the likely impacts on their economies and their citizens,\u201d it said. The OECD said the criticism ignored vital features of its work and misrepresented the outcome for developing world countries. It said the base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) programme has expanded to include 134 countries and it has consulted widely with developing world leaders on the best way to tackle tax abuses. \u201cThere is no recognition of this fact which is important because we now serve all these countries and a compromise will have to be found among all of them,\u201d said Pascal Saint-Amans, head of the BEPS project. \u201cWe are not drafting books for the shelves or speeches for whoever, we are trying to get all countries to agree which means that a solution will have to be somewhere between the current proposals on the table. If there is no agreement there will be a much worse situation for all, starting with developing countries,\u201d he said.",

Perhaps the home manager\u2019s bravery in offering 19-year-old Matty Longstaff his Premier League debut alongside his older brother Sean in central midfield will one day come to be regarded as a watershed moment on both sides of the Pennines. Whatever the future holds for Bruce and his increasingly beleaguered Manchester United counterpart, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, the Longstaff family will never forget the afternoon tears tumbled down Matty\u2019s cheeks after he registered an imperiously unerring 25-yard winning goal which might as well have been an arrow through the Norwegian\u2019s heart. In simultaneously relieving the considerable stress building around Newcastle\u2019s manager and increasing the pressure mounting on Solskj\u00e6r, Longstaff minor lifted his team out of the relegation zone and left the visitors hovering only two points above the bottom three. Manchester United\u2019s manager watched in dismay as his side \u2013 without an away win since March \u2013 exhibited an almost painful lack of invention, improvisation and incision in the course of another horribly ponderous, at times almost slow motion performance, in the north-east rain. Last Sunday night Newcastle had flown back to Tyneside in silence after a 5-0 thrashing at Leicester but a week on it was Manchester United\u2019s turn to endure what must have been an excruciatingly uncomfortable plane ride home. At a time when his tenure is being compared unfavourably with that of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s it is hard to envisage Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s Old Trafford reign extending beyond the short term. Not that Bruce had much sympathy as he celebrated his first managerial victory against the club where he once proved a bedrock of Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s defence.

Newcastle immediately looked radically improved with the excellent Allan Saint-Maximin\u2019s left-sided advances repeatedly ruffling their guests and Matty Longstaff, looking very much at home. Only the woodwork came between the latter and a first-half goal after he collected Jetro Willems\u2019 short pass, took a steadying touch with his left foot and then unleashed a sublime right footed 20-yard half volley which ricocheted back off the crossbar. Not to be upstaged by his younger brother, Sean Longstaff \u2013 apparently targeted by Manchester United last summer \u2013 whipped in a corner for Fabian Sch\u00e4r to head narrowly off target. Manchester United had still to register a shot on target but that finally changed in the 42nd minute when Andreas Pereira directed a long-range effort straight at Martin Dubravka in the Newcastle goal. With Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s players retaining quite a bit of possession yet doing precious little with it, Newcastle\u2019s counterattacking tactics afforded them a much more menacing look.

Bruce cursed beneath his breath but Marcus Rashford made a much more minimal impact than the Paraguayan, barely touching the ball in a first half when Manchester United\u2019s \u00a3250,000-a-week striker invariably found himself isolated in attack. There is no danger of Andy Carroll walking alone on Tyneside and, sure enough, the returning local hero was cheered to the rafters as he replaced Joelinton early in the second period.

Last week the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/oct/03/women-not-entitled-to-pension-age-change-compensation-rules-high-court\" title=\"\">high court rejected the arguments</a> in a judicial review brought by the campaign group BackTo60. The group argued that changes to the law in 1995 and 2011 were discriminatory on grounds of sex and age, and that 3.8 million women should be compensated. But while last Thursday\u2019s loss was a setback, the campaign is far from over. An appeal is one possibility. Continuing pressure on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/03/older-women-pensions-retirement-age\" title=\"\">politicians \u2013 including the prime minister</a>, who pledged during his leadership campaign to take a fresh look at the sums \u2013 is a certainty.</p> <p>The principle of pension age equalisation is not contested. Neither the BackTo60 group (despite its name) nor Women Against State Pension Inequality (Waspi) believes that changes to the law should be reversed so that women continue to receive state pensions at a younger age than men. Equalisation has been the work of several governments, with a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-46101343\" title=\"\">crucial landmark passed last year</a> when 65-year-old women became the first to qualify at the same age as men.</p> <p>But 1950s-born women argue that the pace of change has been too rapid, penalising them as a cohort. In addition, the women and their supporters \u2013 who include the former Conservative pensions minister Ros Altmann \u2013 believe that not enough was done to inform them of the changes, either when they were brought in or since. The consequence has been that many (no one knows precisely how many) simply did not find out. Those without workplace pensions or private wealth, who expected to be living on their state pensions from the age of 60, are now trapped on working-age benefits with all that entails in terms of the requirement to seek work (campaigners cite cases of women in their 60s being told to apply for apprenticeships).</p> <p>That this is far from the only injustice of a failing benefits system does not make the Waspi women undeserving. Nor does the protection of pensioner incomes relative to other groups, under the 2011 triple lock, mean that the poverty of younger sixtysomethings is unimportant. On the contrary, the growing gap between working-age and pensioner benefits is one reason why the 1950s-born women are so determined. Another is the prejudice routinely encountered by older jobseekers. A third is that age and poor health, even when these do not amount to disability, restrict what is possible, as do the caring responsibilities routinely and disproportionately shouldered by women.</p> <p>While the judges rejected BackTo60\u2019s case on grounds that the previous arrangement, under which men were expected to work longer, discriminated against them, the most cursory grasp of sexual politics points to a more complex truth. While pension rules, considered narrowly, may have favoured women, the reasons why they were expected to retire earlier were far from advantageous. Before women\u2019s liberation movements led to legislation such as the 1970 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/sep/02/carrie-gracie-i-learned-about-equal-pay-the-hard-way\" title=\"\">Equal Pay Act</a>, women\u2019s work was regarded as secondary; their domestic and reproductive labour was considered their most important role. Many were expected to stop working when they married. Some who continued were excluded from pension schemes as part-timers.</p> <p>This is the world that the 1950s-born women grew up in. For ministers, courts or society as a whole to refuse to offer them some form of redress smacks of victim-blaming, while the acceleration of changes in 2011 was only \u201cless controversial\u201d than other cuts \u2013 in <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/work-until-you-re-70-chancellor-accused-of-living-in-fantasy-land-over-autumn-statement-pension-8983752.html\" title=\"\">George Osborne\u2019s phrase</a> \u2013 because those affected did not know what was going on. That the law must be changed so that any future changes are properly communicated is one of the more obvious lessons of last week. That the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/26/uk-pensions-gender-gap-widens-past-decade-figures\" title=\"\">growing gender pension gap</a> should face similar scrutiny to the gender pay gap is another. Given the current huge disparity in retirement incomes, a scheme granting at least some 1950s-born women early access to their state pensions, or means-tested pension credits, is the least that ministers ought to do as soon as possible.</p>",

On the contrary, the growing gap between working-age and pensioner benefits is one reason why the 1950s-born women are so determined. Another is the prejudice routinely encountered by older jobseekers. A third is that age and poor health, even when these do not amount to disability, restrict what is possible, as do the caring responsibilities routinely and disproportionately shouldered by women. While the judges rejected BackTo60\u2019s case on grounds that the previous arrangement, under which men were expected to work longer, discriminated against them, the most cursory grasp of sexual politics points to a more complex truth. While pension rules, considered narrowly, may have favoured women, the reasons why they were expected to retire earlier were far from advantageous. Before women\u2019s liberation movements led to legislation such as the 1970 Equal Pay Act, women\u2019s work was regarded as secondary; their domestic and reproductive labour was considered their most important role. Many were expected to stop working when they married. Some who continued were excluded from pension schemes as part-timers. This is the world that the 1950s-born women grew up in. For ministers, courts or society as a whole to refuse to offer them some form of redress smacks of victim-blaming, while the acceleration of changes in 2011 was only \u201cless controversial\u201d than other cuts \u2013 in George Osborne\u2019s phrase \u2013 because those affected did not know what was going on. That the law must be changed so that any future changes are properly communicated is one of the more obvious lessons of last week. That the growing gender pension gap should face similar scrutiny to the gender pay gap is another. Given the current huge disparity in retirement incomes, a scheme granting at least some 1950s-born women early access to their state pensions, or means-tested pension credits, is the least that ministers ought to do as soon as possible.",

      "bodyText": "Some of Australia\u2019s biggest corporations have hidden political donations from planning authorities, which is a criminal offence in New South Wales, a Guardian investigation has found. Woolworths, Caltex, Origin Energy, AMP and Incitec Pivot are among 13 companies that declared sizeable political donations to the Liberal and Labor parties to the Electoral Commission, but failed to declare them when seeking approval to develop property in NSW. The revelations have prompted an investigation by the state\u2019s planning department, which pledged to \u201ctake action\u201d if it confirmed breaches detected by the Guardian. The law compels companies to declare recent donations above $1,000 when lodging applications to develop or modify property in NSW, a measure designed to prevent property developers from corrupting the political process. The former anti-corruption commissioner Anthony Whealy QC said he suspected the important transparency measure was \u201coften ignored\u201d and went largely unenforced. \u201cYou can have as many prohibitive laws and regulations as you like,\u201d Whealy told the Guardian. \u201cHowever, the absence of an efficient regulator, and the absence of effective oversight, leads inevitably to the law being disregarded. Apparently this is what has happened in these instances.\u201d Guardian Australia cross-checked property records against donations made in NSW and found hundreds of thousands of dollars of donations had been hidden from planning authorities by 13 companies. Woolworths failed to declare more than $100,000 in donations to the NSW Liberals and Nationals while seeking to secure minor approvals for a supermarket at Mullumbimby, near Byron Bay. After being contacted by the Guardian, the company acknowledged the error, committed to a full review of its past planning applications and referred itself to the NSW planning department. \u201cWhile we fully disclosed historical political donations to the NSW Electoral Commission as required, it would appear that parts of our business which manage planning applications were regrettably not aware of these disclosures,\u201d the company said. In another case, the wealth manager AMP, which endured a torrid time at the banking royal commission, failed to declare a $1,650 fee for membership of the Liberal party\u2019s Millennium Forum and several other small donations to the NSW Liberal and Labor parties while seeking approval for a luxury apartment development at Sydney\u2019s Circular Quay. The Millennium Forum \u2013 which facilitates interactions between corporate Australia and the Liberal party \u2013 gained notoriety at the Independent Commission Against Corruption in 2014 over allegations it was used to funnel prohibited donations to the Liberal party from property developers. AMP said it did not believe it needed to disclose the Millennium Forum membership fee to planning authorities because it \u201cwas not considered to be a political donation\u201d, and noted the development application and the donations were lodged by separate AMP entities. Other companies have previously been prosecuted for failing to declare payments to attend political party events. The Department of Planning, Industry and Environment said it would launch an investigation into the undeclared donations after the Guardian passed on its findings. \u201cIn the event that any breach is identified, the department will take action in accordance with its compliance policy,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cApplicants are responsible for disclosing their own political donations at the time of submitting their application, and face penalties for failing to do so.\u201d The spokesman said the department\u2019s compliance team had carried out annual audits of donation disclosures since 2016, investigating dozens of cases and taking appropriate action where required. It has also recently improved disclosure processes to prevent \u201cinadvertent failures\u201d to declare donations, and prosecuted companies including AGL and Optus. Most of the companies said the errors were \u201cadministrative\u201d in nature, and said the donations had been declared to electoral authorities, just not to the planning department. But failure to comply with the laws can still have significant consequences, regardless of whether the error was deliberate. Most recently, Optus was convicted of a criminal offence, fined $25,000, and ordered to pay $40,000 in legal costs for accidentally failing to declare six donations worth $5,400 to the Liberal and Labor party while seeking approval for work in the Snowy Mountains ahead of the ski season. The donations it failed to declare were described as \u201csmall payments to attend events\u201d. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Whealy said it would be preferable if corporations did not see it necessary to make political donations at all. \u201cThey would not be made unless the donor expected to get something out of it. This is the reality,\u201d he said. \u201cThe perception, and sadly sometimes the reality, is that the donor expects favourable treatment ... this is totally unacceptable.\u201d Fuel giant Caltex failed to declare $16,727 in donations to the NSW branch of the National party in applications made in 2010 and 2013 to modify its Kurnell fuel refinery. A spokesperson for the company said it was policy to disclose all donations to the relevant electoral authorities, but \u201cit is not clear why there are discrepancies between these disclosures and those made in development applications in 2010 and 2013\u201d. Origin Energy, which left $4,565 off forms requesting approval to modify the Eraring ash dam, said an \u201cadministrative oversight resulted in us not detailing our attendance at a small number of political events when we lodged our application\u201d. The company said it had \u201csubsequently updated [its] donations disclosure\u201d. ABC Tissue, whose then managing director Henry Ngai sat on the board of the Huang Xiangmo-founded Australia-China Relations Institute, admitted it made a $25,000 donation to the NSW Liberal party without filing a disclosure form in an application to modify its Wetherill Park paper mill. A company spokesperson said that \u201cat the time [it] completed the application\u201d the company was \u201cnot aware\u201d of the donation, even though it was declared to the NSW Electoral Commission. Scott Nash, a barrister practising in local government and property planning law who has experience lodging disclosures, said transparency measures were key, as a \u201cdevelopment application may be determined by the elected [local] councillors\u201d, and a record of donations assisted them in identifying any \u201cconflict of interest preventing them from voting\u201d. \u201cIt would be naive to say the source of funding doesn\u2019t affect decision-making in the political process.\u201d Serena Lillywhite, chief executive of Transparency International Australia, said the failure to declare donations was \u201cfundamentally bad for our democracy\u201d. \u201cLobbying and undue influence is increasingly characterising the political landscape in Australia,\u201d she said. Beef suppliers Teys Australia, ski resort operator Kosciuszko Thredbo and waste management specialists Veolia Environmental Services combined for $8,898 in undisclosed donations on planning applications. Veolia said the matter was under review, but had no further comment. Teys and Kosciuszko Thredbo declined to comment. Riverina Oils and Bio Energy, which manufactures consumer oil products, conceded that an \u201cadministrative error was made\u201d in a 2015 application that omitted $2,000 in donations to the NSW Liberal MP Daryl Maguire. \u201cWe have officially informed the planning department of the administrative error,\u201d a spokesman said.",

Sure, the Wallabies will not want to see any of their top players injured against Georgia, but the risk of injury is just as great at training. If key Wallabies are rested against Georgia, they will have received either no game time, or very little, since the loss to Wales, diminishing their match fitness.</p> \n<p>The All Blacks fielded a near full-strength team against Tonga in their World Cup warm-up to prepare for the opening game of the tournament against South Africa. The Wallabies should treat Georgia the same way, a full dress rehearsal for the quarter-final, honing their combinations and skills for the sudden-death game.</p> \n<p>The question is, what is the Wallabies best team? Do the selectors even know? The tight-five of Scott Sio, Tolu Latu, Allan Alaalatoa, Rory Arnold and Izack Rodda is pretty much settled as it has been the Wallabies\u2019 best-performing area so far in the tournament.</p> \n<p>But positions from number six to number 10 remain something of a mystery. We can be almost certain the \u201cPooper\u201d back-row combination of David Pocock and Michael Hooper will start the quarter-final, despite calls for a big blindside flanker. It has been duly noted that Pocock, regarded as the best breakdown forward in world rugby, has not won any turnovers in this tournament.</p> \n<p>That is largely because of a key law change at the breakdown that favours the team in possession at the tackle contest, making it much more difficult to pilfer the ball. But the real strength of the \u201cPooper\u201d combination is not so much playing hard on the ball, but their solid defence. Without Pocock and Hooper on the field at the same time, the Wallabies are very vulnerable defensively.</p> \n<p>As long as the Wallabies have a big number eight such as Isi Naisararni, they should be able to get away with having two shorter flankers. But Naisarani will face a strong challenge from Jack Dempsey for the gold number eight jersey. Dempsey showed brilliant footwork and physicality against Uruguay. If he can\u2019t dislodge Naisarani, he might beat blindside flanker Lukhan SalaKaia-Loto for a spot on the bench.</p> \n<p>But do the Wallabies want to deny themselves the option of adding size to the back-row should they need it? The pressing question is who will start in the halves? Nic White and Christian Lealiifano or Will Genia and Bernard Foley?</p> \n<p>Before the World Cup coach Michael Cheika hinted he would adopt a horses-for-courses approach and has flipped the halves combination in each game. It is Genia and Foley\u2019s turn to start against Georgia, but are they the best combination? Probably not. White and Lealiifano should start against Georgia, unless Cheika is keeping Matt Toomua up his sleeve as a number 10 option.</p> \n<p>The mid-field combination of Samu Kerevi and James O\u2019Connor as well as left winger Marika Koroibete seem the only certain starters in the backline. At fullback, the selectors must decide between the safety-first option of Dane Haylett-Petty and the x-factor of Kurtley Beale. At this stage it looks as if Beale will continue his role as a super-sub.</p> \n<p>And, of course, the arrival of teen sensation Jordan Petaia has given the selectors something to mull over in relation to the right wing. Petaia, 19, made a wonderful debut against Uruguay, scoring a try, but is he ready to start in the quarter-final ahead of the likes of Reece Hodge, Adam Ashley-Cooper or even Haylett-Petty? There is an old truism in rugby that if you are good enough, you are old enough, and Petaia certainly looked good enough, albeit he was only playing against Uruguay.</p> \n<p>Whoever the selectors decide to go with for Georgia, they need to pick the best possible Wallabies team to prepare for the quarter-final. Eddie Jones unwittingly tipped the Wallabies into the danger of the draw and they would be wise to listen to the former Australia mentor.</p>",

The All Blacks fielded a near full-strength team against Tonga in their World Cup warm-up to prepare for the opening game of the tournament against South Africa. The Wallabies should treat Georgia the same way, a full dress rehearsal for the quarter-final, honing their combinations and skills for the sudden-death game. The question is, what is the Wallabies best team? Do the selectors even know? The tight-five of Scott Sio, Tolu Latu, Allan Alaalatoa, Rory Arnold and Izack Rodda is pretty much settled as it has been the Wallabies\u2019 best-performing area so far in the tournament. But positions from number six to number 10 remain something of a mystery. We can be almost certain the \u201cPooper\u201d back-row combination of David Pocock and Michael Hooper will start the quarter-final, despite calls for a big blindside flanker. It has been duly noted that Pocock, regarded as the best breakdown forward in world rugby, has not won any turnovers in this tournament. That is largely because of a key law change at the breakdown that favours the team in possession at the tackle contest, making it much more difficult to pilfer the ball. But the real strength of the \u201cPooper\u201d combination is not so much playing hard on the ball, but their solid defence. Without Pocock and Hooper on the field at the same time, the Wallabies are very vulnerable defensively. As long as the Wallabies have a big number eight such as Isi Naisararni, they should be able to get away with having two shorter flankers. But Naisarani will face a strong challenge from Jack Dempsey for the gold number eight jersey. Dempsey showed brilliant footwork and physicality against Uruguay. If he can\u2019t dislodge Naisarani, he might beat blindside flanker Lukhan SalaKaia-Loto for a spot on the bench. But do the Wallabies want to deny themselves the option of adding size to the back-row should they need it? The pressing question is who will start in the halves? Nic White and Christian Lealiifano or Will Genia and Bernard Foley? Before the World Cup coach Michael Cheika hinted he would adopt a horses-for-courses approach and has flipped the halves combination in each game. It is Genia and Foley\u2019s turn to start against Georgia, but are they the best combination? Probably not. White and Lealiifano should start against Georgia, unless Cheika is keeping Matt Toomua up his sleeve as a number 10 option. The mid-field combination of Samu Kerevi and James O\u2019Connor as well as left winger Marika Koroibete seem the only certain starters in the backline. At fullback, the selectors must decide between the safety-first option of Dane Haylett-Petty and the x-factor of Kurtley Beale. At this stage it looks as if Beale will continue his role as a super-sub. And, of course, the arrival of teen sensation Jordan Petaia has given the selectors something to mull over in relation to the right wing. Petaia, 19, made a wonderful debut against Uruguay, scoring a try, but is he ready to start in the quarter-final ahead of the likes of Reece Hodge, Adam Ashley-Cooper or even Haylett-Petty? There is an old truism in rugby that if you are good enough, you are old enough, and Petaia certainly looked good enough, albeit he was only playing against Uruguay. Whoever the selectors decide to go with for Georgia, they need to pick the best possible Wallabies team to prepare for the quarter-final. Eddie Jones unwittingly tipped the Wallabies into the danger of the draw and they would be wise to listen to the former Australia mentor.",

That day police shot a protester with live ammunition for the first time, seriously injuring the teenager. Three days later another schoolboy was shot in the thigh. There have been other serious casualties, including a journalist blinded in one eye, and more than 1,100 people have been treated at hospitals for injuries from the protests. Water cannons laced with dye, beanbags, rubber and sponge-tipped bullets, pepper spray, baton charges and mass arrests have all become common.

Many bookmakers will be pleading poverty should she make history today before sprinting sensation Battaash follows up, but the bigger problem for the firms may arise down the line when Frankie finally hangs up his boots as today\u2019s evidence suggests recreational betting fans are more than happy to get involved when the Italian is lining up to ride a surefire winner.

It was seriously, almost unpleasantly, hot. A different experience awaits horses and racegoers in the Bois de Boulogne this afternoon, as the intermittent but heavy showers which hit Paris on Saturday are expected to continue up to and after the Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe at 3.05pm British Standard Time. The sun, as it happens, is out at the moment but as far as the ground goes, the damage has been done. <br><br>The good news for fans of Enable, who will be attempting to record a historic third success in the Arc, is that she has three Group One wins on soft ground to her name, in the Arc (at Chantilly) in 2017, the King George at Ascot the same year and the Breeders\u2019 Cup Turf last November. <br><br>When it comes to her main market rivals, the situation is less clear-cut. Japan won his maiden on soft ground in September last year but has done all his racing since on good ground or better. Ghaiyyath has yet to race on anything slower than good, while a Listed win on good-to-soft is all that Sottsass brings to the party. And when it comes to the three Japanese runners \u2013 Kiseki, Blast Onepiece and Fierement \u2013 they have scarcely a couple of runs on anything other than firm ground to rub together. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"660413c31df043477daad1a67c0969ae70228a21\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/660413c31df043477daad1a67c0969ae70228a21/0_94_4490_2694/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Enable just winning the 2019 Prix de l\u2019Arc De Triomphe.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Enable just winning the 2019 Prix de l\u2019Arc De Triomphe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philippe Lopez/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So even the weather, it seems, is on Enable\u2019s side, but win or lose for John Gosden\u2019s mare, French racing also is bending over backwards to ensure that travelling fans go home with much happier memories of Longchamp this year than last, when the magnificent new grandstand failed to cope with the experience of meeting its first serious crowd. <br><br>A quick stroll around the enclosures just now suggests that, for now at least, the supply of drinks, food and toilet facilities is more than keeping up with demand. If so, all we need now is for the heaviest showers to head elsewhere and Enable to win the Arc for this to be one of the great racing days. The odds on the latter are around 8-11.

      "bodyText": "Enable failed to win the Arc for the third time and Frankie Dettori\u2019s cat better watch out. But the mercurial jockey, who will be on a downer for some time after a dreadful day all round for him, shouldn\u2019t be too hard on himself. He gave the great mare every chance of winning and she could race again. Andre Fabre, the greatest living European trainer, won with Waldgeist. Everything else seemed an anti-climax on the day with some very strange results on the extremely soft ground but we\u2019ll be back next year for Europe\u2019s premier horserace and hoping for similar drama. 1st One Master 3-1fav 2nd City Light 7-2 3rd Speak In Colours 18-1 And they\u2019re off ...

Pierre-Charles Boudot, the jockey of Waldgeist, triumphs for Newmarket trainer William Haggas.

El Astronaute leads early ... Glass Slippers takes it up ... Battaash is struggling and Glass Slippers goes away to win very easily. Frankie Dettori has had his say, and thought the ground was the key factor in Enable\u2019s defeat in the Arc. He said: \u201cThe ground was very sticky and I struggled in the first bit of the race. I let her find her feet and she came good to me in the false straight. I waited for the 300 metres [marker], but didn\u2019t find as much as I thought. \u201cShe just folded a bit and the winner was too good for me today, but my filly was already tired. I passed the 200 [metre pole] and I was a spent force then. I think ground had a lot to do with it.\u201d 4-5 Battaash 7-1 Mabs Cross 10-1 Fairyland 10-1 Spinning Memories 12-1 So Perfect 12-1 Soldier\u2019s Call 14-1 Glass Slippers 16-1 Invincible Army 20-1 Shades Of Blue 25-1 Gold Vibe 33-1 El Astronaute 33-1 Ken Colt 33-1 Sestilio Jet 40-1 Finsbury Square 40-1 Recon Mission 66-1 Jolie Latest betting here at Oddschecker. One question worth asking is why was the Arc run so early. International TV scheduling maybe? It\u2019s a strange one as it has added to the deflated atmosphere around the track. Race meetings are much better when the build to the big-race climax. Enable may have been beaten in the Arc but she ran a brave race and Frankie Dettori seemed to have her in the perfect place in the home straight, just being outstayed in the final furlong. She still got a great welcome on her return to the unsaddling enclosure ... 1st Villa Marina 18-1 2nd Fleeting 16-1 3rd Watch Me 10-1 And they\u2019re off ... Mehdaayih and Frankie Dettori have the lead, the rider determined to get back in the winner\u2019s enclosure ... Terebellum, the stablemate, is second, with Commes close up ... it\u2019s wide open ... Villa Marina just holds the fast-finishing Fleeting in a blanket finish. It\u2019s not Frankie\u2019s day, the favourite well beaten under the Italian. For those of a nervous disposition look away now. The bookies have had their say on that ultimately deflating Arc de Triomphe. A Bookmakers.tv spokesperson said: \u201cEnable fever allowed Waldgeist to go off at a huge price in the UK relative to his form and he\u2019s saved British firms a record Arc payout by picking up the mare in the dying strides. \u201cHowever favourable the result for the trading departments of the bookmakers, it\u2019s a huge anti-climax on what would have been a monumental day for racing. Another win for Frankie and Enable would have lead the news bulletins at a perfect time in the build up to Ascot\u2019s Champions Day and this highlights the risks of a one-horserace marketing strategy in such an unpredictable sport.\u201d Both trainer John Gosden and Teddy Grimthorpe, racing manager for Enable\u2019s owner Khalid Abdullah, declined to confirm Enable\u2019s anticipated immediate retirement. Grimthorpe said: \u201cWe\u2019ve always said Prince Khalid will make the decisions. Whatever happened it wasn\u2019t going to be in a hurry, and I think we will get her back. Prince Khalid will want to reflect on all the various possibilities, give it some good thought \u2013 and hopefully we\u2019ll come up with a good answer. \u201cHow can we complain? She\u2019s been the most fantastic filly. Prince Khalid has just enjoyed every moment of her. It was not what we all wanted obviously but in the end we have to accept these things in racing. We don\u2019t love her any less.\u201d 7-4 Mehdaayih 9-2 Terebellum 7-1 Watch Me 7-1 With You 10-1 Commes 12-1 Pink Dogwood 14-1 Fleeting 16-1 Etoile 16-1 Goddess 20-1 Villa Marina 33-1 Cartiem 33-1 Ligne D\u2019Or Full betting at Oddschecker here. If you\u2019re sticking around for the rest of the afternoon\u2019s action it is live on Sky Sports Racing and it\u2019s all high quality. Enable had to make do with the runner-up spot in her bid for history and a third victory in the Qatar Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe as Waldgeist provided Andre Fabre with a record eighth success. Having stretched her Group One tally to 10 with victories in the Coral-Eclipse, the King George and the Yorkshire Oaks this season, all eyes were on John Gosden\u2019s brilliant mare as she aimed to become the first three-time winner of Europe\u2019s premier middle-distance contest. Frankie Dettori had to niggle the 4-6 favourite along during the early stages, but she was back on the bridle at the top of the home straight and looked well positioned to race into the record books. Once asked to quicken, Enable did manage to pull clear \u2013 and the packed grandstands in Paris roared in expectation. However, her stride began to shorten in the final furlong on the testing ground and she was unable to resist the fast-finishing 16-1 shot Waldgeist - fourth in last year\u2019s renewal and beaten by Enable on each of the three previous occasions they had met. PA Read the full story here. 1st Waldgeist 16-1 2nd Enable 4-6fav 3rd Sottsass 8-1 They\u2019re off ... Soft Light is slowly away and Fierement leads with Blast Onepiece just behind with Enable in midfield ... and Ghaiyyath now takes the lead ... and the Godolphin runner will attempt to make all the running from now on in with Enable in fourth ...

Andre Fabre, when asked about how his horse, Waldgeist, was going to beat Enable in the Arc replied: \u201cI don\u2019t want to kill Bambi!\u201d The great French trainer was more forthcoming about his Prix Jean-Luc Lagardere winner Victor Ludorum, who maintained his unbeaten record with an impressive display. Fabre \u2013 who also trains Middle Park winner Earthlight in the Godolphin blue \u2013 said: \u201cI think he is really good, as he is a laid-back horse and has a fantastic attitude. He does everything easily. \u201cThe ground was a big concern, as he is a light mover, but he handled it very well. Race after race he remains unbeaten and does everything easily. He could be a very good horse. We will aim for a Classic campaign and the French Guineas, I\u2019d imagine.\u201d He added: \u201cHe is not too big or small, he is a neat horse. We will have discussions with Sheikh Mohammed, as he has a good bunch of two-year-olds, but I\u2019d imagine he will be aimed at the French Guineas and the Prix du Jockey Club. \u201cHe is less precocious than Earthlight and is not a natural two-year-old like Earthlight and has less natural speed than Earthlight, but he would stay further than him, for sure.\u201d Guardian sport and agencies Andre Fabre, European trainer par excellence, is very enamoured of Victor Ludorum, speaking of him, prefaced by a \u201cif I dare\u201d, in the same breath as Mill Reef. 1st Victor Ludorum 2-1fav 2nd Alson 11-1 3rd Armory 9-4 Albigna bounced back to winning ways with an ultimately clear-cut success in the Prix Marcel Boussac at ParisLongchamp. Jessica Harrington\u2019s charge had looked every inch a top-class filly in the making after winning a maiden and the Group Two Airlie Stud Stakes at the Curragh earlier the season. The Niarchos family-owned juvenile disappointed when strongly fancied for the Moyglare Stud Stakes three weeks ago, but was later found to be in season. This one-mile contest presented the daughter of Zoffany with a second chance to grab Group One glory - and while she was under pressure in the hands of Shane Foley before the home turn, she responded admirably to her rider\u2019s urgings. Harrington said: \u201cI wasn\u2019t really confident beforehand as she has only run on good and good to firm ground, so we were going into the unknown. I was really not that confident going into today, but she showed the real Albigna that we see at home. \u201cI\u2019ve only seen it the once and I thought she wasn\u2019t travelling that great, but Shane said afterwards that she likes to find her feet, which she did in her first two races. In the Moyglare she ran a bit free and was found to be in season afterwards.\u201d RaceBets, Betfair and Coral all cut Harrington\u2019s charge to 14-1 from 25-1 for next year\u2019s 1,000 Guineas. Harrington said: \u201cIt is wonderful to win this race and I\u2019m grateful to the Niarchos family for sending me these beautifully-bred yearlings \u2013 after the year we had last year with Alpha Centauri I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d possibly have a year like this with the two-year-old fillies. \u201cI would imagine so [she will go to the Guineas], she gets the mile well and she is a big filly and I\u2019d imagine she would stay further than a mile. This is a \u2018win and you\u2019re in\u2019 for the Breeders\u2019 Cup and I know that it is very close to the heart of Maria [Niarchos], the Breeders\u2019 Cup, so we will talk about that after the dust has settled here. \u201cI would say she is probably top of the pecking order (of the stable\u2019s fillies) as she stayed the mile so she looks more like a Classic filly.\u201d PA They\u2019re off ... Alson and Frankie Dettori lead with Armory close behind ... Ecrivain is in third ... Alson running free in the lead ... Armory still close behind ... they kick for home with Victor Ludorum coming through fast to hold on an keep his unbeaten record with Alson and Helter Skelter following him home. Back to memory lane and another great Arc winner in Mill Reef, winning in 1971 after his success in the Derby that year ... 2-1 Victor Ludorum 7-2 Ecrivain 9-2 Armory 8-1 Helter Skelter 8-1 Kenway 12-1 Alson 33-1 Chachnak Full betting here at Oddschecker 1st Albigna 4-1 2nd Mareita 11-2 3rd Flighty Lady 7-1 They\u2019re off ...

Mareita tries to kick on and Savarin is under pressure ... Marieta weakens close home and finishes second to the strong-finishing Albigna, trained by the Irish handler Jessica Harrington. Savarin, the mount of Yutaka Take, as big a name in Japan as David Beckham was at the height of his fame here, is favourite for the opener on Arc day and he looks ready. The race will be off in less than ten minutes 100-30 Savarin 4-1 Albigna 6-1 Bionic Woman, 6-1 Marieta, 8-1 Flighty Lady, 10-1 Kenlova, 10-1 Plegastell 20-1 Nunzia, 100-1 Fee Historique Full betting on Oddschecker here. Enable is at the track ... We are going to miss Frankie Dettori when he hangs up his boots - and whisper it but it would not be the biggest surprise in the world if he did so after he wins the big race - but the bookies will too. And it\u2019s no surprise to hear how much impact he has on the betting. There are plenty of British punters piling on the Enable-Battaash double today. Battaash is the hot favourite for the Prix de l\u2019Abbaye whihc is off at 4.30pm. A spokesman for bonuscodebets.co.uk said: \u201cThe Frankie factor and Enable\u2019s superstar status mean today\u2019s Arc looks set to smash betting records. Many bookmakers will be pleading poverty should she make history today before sprinting sensation Battaash follows up, but the bigger problem for the firms may arise down the line when Frankie finally hangs up his boots as today\u2019s evidence suggests recreational betting fans are more than happy to get involved when the Italian is lining up to ride a surefire winner. It\u2019s difficult to see anyone else whip the mainstream market into such a frenzy when he\u2019s gone.\u201d And here are Greg Wood\u2019s Sunday tips in full for today\u2019s domestic races. Our trip down Arc memory lane continues with what many Turfistes believe is the greatest Arc winner, Sea-Bird. The brilliant colt is the only horse to have won the Derby on the bridle and in 1965 beat what is widely regarded as the greatest field to assemble for the Arc with ease. Here, with Peter O\u2019Sullevan commentary, is Sea-Bird ... On Arc trials day at Longchamp three weeks ago, there was scarcely a cloud in the sky and the mid-afternoon temperature peaked at around 27 degrees. It was seriously, almost unpleasantly, hot. A different experience awaits horses and racegoers in the Bois de Boulogne this afternoon, as the intermittent but heavy showers which hit Paris on Saturday are expected to continue up to and after the Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe at 3.05pm British Standard Time. The sun, as it happens, is out at the moment but as far as the ground goes, the damage has been done. The good news for fans of Enable, who will be attempting to record a historic third success in the Arc, is that she has three Group One wins on soft ground to her name, in the Arc (at Chantilly) in 2017, the King George at Ascot the same year and the Breeders\u2019 Cup Turf last November. When it comes to her main market rivals, the situation is less clear-cut. Japan won his maiden on soft ground in September last year but has done all his racing since on good ground or better. Ghaiyyath has yet to race on anything slower than good, while a Listed win on good-to-soft is all that Sottsass brings to the party. And when it comes to the three Japanese runners \u2013 Kiseki, Blast Onepiece and Fierement \u2013 they have scarcely a couple of runs on anything other than firm ground to rub together. So even the weather, it seems, is on Enable\u2019s side, but win or lose for John Gosden\u2019s mare, French racing also is bending over backwards to ensure that travelling fans go home with much happier memories of Longchamp this year than last, when the magnificent new grandstand failed to cope with the experience of meeting its first serious crowd. A quick stroll around the enclosures just now suggests that, for now at least, the supply of drinks, food and toilet facilities is more than keeping up with demand. If so, all we need now is for the heaviest showers to head elsewhere and Enable to win the Arc for this to be one of the great racing days. The odds on the latter are around 8-11. As for the rain, check in here for updates as the afternoon unfolds. Enable would be joining a long list of Arc greats if winning today, to be mentioned in the same breath as ... well I\u2019ll be introducing you to them or reminding you of them ... depending how old or how committed a racing fan you aree. We\u2019ll start with Ribot, who won the Arc in 1955 and 1956. Here\u2019s Pathe film of his second win, with some ripe Pathe commentary, including how the \u201ccompetition in the ooh-la-la section was also pretty strong\u201d ... ladies and gentlemen the great, unbeaten Ribot ... It\u2019s Arc day and horse racing fans have been waiting for this since the moment Enable just managed to hold off the last-gasp challenge of Sea Of Class and cross the line for her second victory in Europe\u2019s most prestigious race last year. Enable\u2019s story has proved the most riveting on the Flat racing circuit since the mighty Frankel\u2019s road to greatness and she would take her place in the European racing pantheon with a third straight win at Longchamp today. Frankie Dettori\u2019s mount is an odds-on shot but victory is by no means assured especially with the persistent rain resulting in very soft ground for the big race. Or as the French say, Tres Souple! Greg Wood, our man at the track, has suggested runaway Baden-Baden winner Ghaiyyath as an each-way alternative at 12-1. There are no less than six Group One races on the Longchamp card today, with the first race off at 1.15pm \u2013 so sit back and relax and let me and Greg Wood in Paris be your guide to what could prove a historic day for racing.",

He is obviously not a very good leader and not very charismatic, but I can see nothing which justifies the extent of the prejudice against him. The principal issue which makes him \u201cunfit\u201d to be prime minister seems to be that he is accused of promoting a \u201chard left\u201d or \u201cextreme left\u201d agenda. When I examine the policies promoted by the Labour party under his leadership (a party of which I am not a member or even a voter), I am baffled by such a description.</p> <p>For me, \u201chard left\u201d or \u201cextreme left\u201d implies a rigid state authority imposing a universalist state economy and social levelling, with insufficient priority for values of democracy or tolerance or personal freedom. The Labour party under Corbyn is nothing of this kind, promoting, yes, greater state management and regulation of the economy and greater equality, but simply as a push towards a more mixed economy and a necessary rebalancing after 40 years of continuous rightwing neoliberal change. Little that they propose would have been out of place in a Liberal or Social Democratic party manifesto of former times. Nor do I detect any sympathy with undemocratic, intolerant or illiberal means to achieve these limited ends.</p> <p>The leader of the Labour party has always suffered from the vilification and smears of the predominant rightwing press, but what has given this propaganda much greater traction with the public in Corbyn\u2019s case is the support for this campaign by significant elements within the Labour party, including very many MPs, and their lack of any meaningful support for their elected leader. I am dismayed that, faced with the genuine unfitness of Boris Johnson and his odious team, the next election will be lost to progressives as a result.<br><strong>Stephen Smith</strong><br><em>Glasgow</em></p> <p>\u2022 Unless the Labour party changes direction soon, it will be complicit in the huge damage the UK will suffer if we leave the EU, with or without a deal, on Boris Johnson\u2019s terms. By failing to unite around a leader who has a chance of being elected by the British people and a clear policy on Brexit itself, Labour has played into the hands of the Conservative and Brexit parties.

After Brexit, Scotland would almost certainly demand a second independence referendum, with a strong chance of a vote to leave the union.</p> <p>The stakes could not be higher. For the sake of this country, Labour needs to get a grip: find a leader who can win wide support around the country; stop hedging its bets on Brexit; and join the other opposition parties to stop Boris Johnson destroying the UK.

      "bodyText": "Gary Younge\u2019s article (For those who want to stop no deal, Corbyn is the only hope, 4 October) made me rack my brains again to try to understand the consensus of aversion against Jeremy Corbyn. He is obviously not a very good leader and not very charismatic, but I can see nothing which justifies the extent of the prejudice against him. The principal issue which makes him \u201cunfit\u201d to be prime minister seems to be that he is accused of promoting a \u201chard left\u201d or \u201cextreme left\u201d agenda. When I examine the policies promoted by the Labour party under his leadership (a party of which I am not a member or even a voter), I am baffled by such a description. For me, \u201chard left\u201d or \u201cextreme left\u201d implies a rigid state authority imposing a universalist state economy and social levelling, with insufficient priority for values of democracy or tolerance or personal freedom. The Labour party under Corbyn is nothing of this kind, promoting, yes, greater state management and regulation of the economy and greater equality, but simply as a push towards a more mixed economy and a necessary rebalancing after 40 years of continuous rightwing neoliberal change. Little that they propose would have been out of place in a Liberal or Social Democratic party manifesto of former times. Nor do I detect any sympathy with undemocratic, intolerant or illiberal means to achieve these limited ends. The leader of the Labour party has always suffered from the vilification and smears of the predominant rightwing press, but what has given this propaganda much greater traction with the public in Corbyn\u2019s case is the support for this campaign by significant elements within the Labour party, including very many MPs, and their lack of any meaningful support for their elected leader. I am dismayed that, faced with the genuine unfitness of Boris Johnson and his odious team, the next election will be lost to progressives as a result. Stephen Smith Glasgow \u2022 Unless the Labour party changes direction soon, it will be complicit in the huge damage the UK will suffer if we leave the EU, with or without a deal, on Boris Johnson\u2019s terms. By failing to unite around a leader who has a chance of being elected by the British people and a clear policy on Brexit itself, Labour has played into the hands of the Conservative and Brexit parties. It is just too easy for them to whip up anti-Labour sentiment with claims of Marxist tendencies, policy dithering and antisemitism, whatever the truth. This is now really urgent. With the Brexit deadline rapidly approaching, Labour needs to do something different. Does the party really believe it could win a majority in a general election in its current state, with so many Labour party supporters unsure of how they would vote and the Liberal Democrats resurgent? There is a very serious risk that the Conservatives would win a working majority when we go to the polls, destroying any chance for Labour to implement a progressive agenda. After Brexit, Scotland would almost certainly demand a second independence referendum, with a strong chance of a vote to leave the union. The stakes could not be higher. For the sake of this country, Labour needs to get a grip: find a leader who can win wide support around the country; stop hedging its bets on Brexit; and join the other opposition parties to stop Boris Johnson destroying the UK. This will require tough compromises. But in my book, that is exactly what leadership means. Patrick Davies Former deputy UK ambassador to the US \u2022 As many commentators (from Dominic Grieve to Polly Toynbee) recognise, the current coalition of opposition MPs, including the independent conservatives, is the most precious resource that we have in these dangerous times for UK decency and democracy.

The Spanish Inquisition viewed diet as a good indication of religious belief; refusing pork was considered prima facie evidence of Jewish or Muslim identity. The detailed records of the Holy Office note many sad cases of individuals desperately trying to explain away why they declined a nice piece of ham offered by a neighbour by citing their delicate stomach or the fact that they\u2019d already had dinner. Pedro S\u00e1nchez, the prime minister, may be under attack for his \u201cserious error\u201d of confusing jam\u00f3n serrano with jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico, but it\u2019s worth recalling that in past centuries much more than political reputation could be at stake when it came to pork.

      "body": "<p>The poet Ciaran Carson, who has died aged 70 of cancer, grew up in the Catholic Falls Road area of Belfast. He went on to transfigure his native city, and transfix his readers, with a rich accumulation of poems, metafictions and other unclassifiable prose works, the most recent of which, Exchange Place (2012), was lauded for its elegance and precision.</p> <p>Carson had Belfast lore and topography at his fingertips, but he superimposed a psychic overlay on the city\u2019s mundane streets and terraces, its feuds and factions, the aggravations and atrocities of the bloody 30-year Troubles.</p> <p>The title of his 1989 collection, Belfast Confetti, can refer to the debris falling after an explosion, bits of type erupting from a typewriter (as in its cover image), or a hail of bullets. The high-pressure contents of this book are compressed into an enigmatic and exhilarating pattern of reflections and events.</p> <p>Belfast Confetti is dedicated to the poet\u2019s father: William Carson, a postman and Irish-language aficionado.

      "bodyText": "The poet Ciaran Carson, who has died aged 70 of cancer, grew up in the Catholic Falls Road area of Belfast. He went on to transfigure his native city, and transfix his readers, with a rich accumulation of poems, metafictions and other unclassifiable prose works, the most recent of which, Exchange Place (2012), was lauded for its elegance and precision. Carson had Belfast lore and topography at his fingertips, but he superimposed a psychic overlay on the city\u2019s mundane streets and terraces, its feuds and factions, the aggravations and atrocities of the bloody 30-year Troubles. The title of his 1989 collection, Belfast Confetti, can refer to the debris falling after an explosion, bits of type erupting from a typewriter (as in its cover image), or a hail of bullets. The high-pressure contents of this book are compressed into an enigmatic and exhilarating pattern of reflections and events. Belfast Confetti is dedicated to the poet\u2019s father: William Carson, a postman and Irish-language aficionado. He is a strong presence in his son\u2019s literary output. Ciaran\u2019s mother, Mary Maginn, a one-time mill-girl, gets a look-in too; but the father is predominant. From Carson Sr, Ciaran inherited a love of Irish (the five children of the family grew up bilingual), a flair for traditional music and storytelling and a respect for education as a way of making a mark in the world. Following his schooling at St Mary\u2019s Christian Brothers\u2019 grammar school, Ciaran went on to study for a degree in English at Queen\u2019s University \u2013 where one of his tutors was Seamus Heaney, and two other poets, Medbh McGuckian and Paul Muldoon, were fellow students. He subsequently became an officer with the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, with responsibility for traditional music, and throughout the 1970s and 80s travelled all over Ireland, playing the flute and the tin whistle in pubs and back rooms, often accompanied by his future wife Deirdre Shannon (herself a gifted fiddle-player). They married in 1982. One result of all this jollification was the eccentric and beguiling prose account of those heady days, Last Night\u2019s Fun (1996). \u201cOne of the most inventive looks at Irish music,\u201da reviewer called it, while John Banville summed it up in four words: \u201cWild nights; ashen days\u201d. It\u2019s the wild nights, with all their spark and fervour, that stay in the mind. The New Estate (1976) announced the arrival on the poetic scene of a confident new voice. By 1987, however, the lyrical tone of this first book had given way to the disruptions and dislocations of The Irish for No, as \u201cBelfast tore itself apart and patched itself up again\u201d. Other collections followed with increasing rapidity: First Language (1993); Opera Et Cetera (1996), with its display of technical virtuosity; and the marvellously subversive and narcotic sonnet sequence The Twelfth of Never (1998), in which some of Ireland\u2019s most cherished myths and symbols are taken to pieces and audaciously reassembled. At the same time, the poetry was interspersed with idiosyncratic prose works: Fishing for Amber (1999), Shamrock Tea (2001), The Pen Friend (2009), and The Star Factory (1997). The last is Carson\u2019s partly autobiographical, wholly inspirational book about Belfast, which evokes the poet\u2019s \u201cdark city\u201d in all its pungency and particularity. Asked by the Irish Times earlier this year to nominate his current favourite book, Muldoon chose Carson\u2019s From There to Here: Selected Poems and Translations (2018). Praising his \u201cability to find connections in so many aspects of the world\u201d, he was echoing an earlier comment of his own, that Carson, as an incomparable poet and luminous prose writer, was \u201cterrifically engaged by everything and anything \u2013 stamp-collecting, hurley, cooking\u201d. It is this abundance, alongside felicity of expression, humour and immense erudition, that gives Carson\u2019s work its wonderful zest and intricacy. Other recognition came in the form of the TS Eliot prize, the Irish Times Irish literature prize, the Cholmondeley award, and the Forward prize. Carson\u2019s achievement as a translator was acknowledged with the Oxford-Weidenfeld Translation prize in 2002, for his version of Dante\u2019s Inferno; he also translated The T\u00e1in (2007) and many poems from the original Irish, as well as the French poet Jean Follain (From Elsewhere, 2014). Influences absorbed and cast in a new light \u2013 Rimbaud, Baudelaire, Keats, Borges, Calvino, Flann O\u2019Brien, Alberto Manguel \u2013 impart a cosmopolitan flavour to Carson\u2019s oeuvre, without diluting its intense attachment to his home territory. Some years after resigning from the Arts Council, Carson became the first director of the Seamus Heaney Centre for Poetry at Queen\u2019s, a post he held from 2004 until his retirement in 2016. He was a longstanding member of Aosd\u00e1na, the association of Irish artists. Stylish in his bones, he might have applied his comment on Follain \u2013 that he \u201cwas invariably properly dressed for every occasion\u201d \u2013 to himself, with his love of traditional hand-made suits and shoes, antique tweed jackets, silk shirts and subtle ties. \u201cHardy-handsome,\u201d Heaney called him, referring to the portrait of Carson by Jeffrey Morgan, \u201cwith his Black Mountain behind him and his talismanic flute \u2026\u201d Carson remained characteristically stoical in the face of his illness. His first action on receiving the diagnosis of lung cancer was to embark on a series of poems, ostensibly about paintings (by Poussin, Canaletto and Thomas Jones, among others), but also celebrating his life with Deirdre in a particular part of north Belfast, and of the area itself. The new poems, under the title Still Life, will be published this month. His poem Letters from the Alphabet, reaches \u201cZ\u201d, the end-point, and culminates in a two-line stanza that makes an appropriate valediction for the postman\u2019s son: \u201cIn the morning you will open up the envelope. You will get whatever/ Message is inside. It is for all time. Its postmark is The Twelfth of Never.\u201d He is survived by Deirdre and their children, Manus, Gerard and Mary. \u2022 Ciaran Carson, poet, born 9 October 1948; died 6 October 2019",

In East Anglia, roads were closed and trains faced mass disruptions on Sunday because of flooding, prompting police to warn people to travel only if essential. Norfolk Fire and Rescue Service said it had been \u201cinundated\u201d with 999 calls about \u201cwidespread flooding\u201d as residents were advised to turn off the electricity supply and move their valuables upstairs in precautionary measures. Greater Anglia train services between Norwich, Lowestoft, Great Yarmouth and Sheringham were disrupted due to flooding on railway tracks. Residents were advised against traveling on these routes, with a small number of rail replacement bus services put in place. The Met Office issued an amber warning of possible risk to life and property and issued a statement on Sunday saying Cromer on the Norfolk coast had experienced the highest total rainfall of 46.4mm in the past 12 hours followed by 45.6mm falling at Weybourne and 44.6mm at Tibenham Airfield, both also in Norfolk. Helen Roberts, a Met Office meteorologist, said 64.9mm was the average for such locations in the whole of October. Islay in Scotland also saw heavy rainfall of 55.6mm in 24 hours, while in northern England some areas saw around 20mm. Norfolk police said the issue of surface water on roads was \u201cparticularly acute\u201d in the east of the county, as motorists continue to bear the brunt of the floods. Police in North Yorkshire also warned drivers of the risks posed by standing water on thoroughfares. Five flood warnings, issued by the Environment Agency, were in place on Sunday, covering rivers on the Welsh border near Shrewsbury, Aintree on Merseyside and Reeth in North Yorkshire. A further 51 flood alerts were issued advising people to prepare for possible flooding across northern, central and south-east England. Roberts said: \u201cThe rain in East Anglia will gradually pass and clear but on Monday morning there will be another spell of wet and windy weather pushing in from the west. That will gradually push its way eastward across the UK.\u201d She said by the time it got to East Anglia on Monday it would have lessened but that western and northern areas would take the brunt of the downpours, experiencing \u201ca good few hours of persistent rain\u201d. Roberts said that more blustery showers would hit the north and west on Tuesday and Wednesday with conditions remaining unsettled for the rest of the week. The heavy rain on the weekend came after downpours last week caused flash flooding across the UK and left residents trapped in their homes on the Isle of Man, where a major incident was declared after a river burst its banks. The wet start to the month follows a rainier than average September in which 122.4mm of rain fell \u2013 27% more than the monthly average of 96.4mm.",

      "bodyText": "Labour would not back an interim government to replace Boris Johnson\u2019s administration that was led by anyone other than Jeremy Corbyn, the shadow chancellor John McDonnell has said. The party has always been dismissive of the prospect of Labour MPs voting for anyone other than Corbyn to head a cross-party government tasked with the job of avoiding a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, but Corbyn has been careful not to absolutely rule out the prospect. In an interview published at the weekend McDonnell went further, saying: \u201cThere\u2019s no way we would accept that [an interim government without Corbyn as PM].\u201d The idea is attracting renewed interest at Westminster because, although MPs have passed legislation, the Benn act, designed to rule out a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, No 10 has repeatedly hinted that Johnson might try to circumvent this law. One alternative would be for MPs to seek to replace him with another prime minister willing to negotiate a Brexit delay with the EU in good faith. Given that a replacement PM could only be elected with the backing of Liberal Democrat MPs and former Tories who have lost the whip for rebelling over Brexit, there has been speculation about whether an anti-Johnson majority could unite behind a respected backbencher like Ken Clarke or Harriet Harman, or even the Speaker, John Bercow. Corbyn will meet other opposition party leaders on Monday to decide the next steps to ensure the government abides with the Benn act. In an interview with the Italian news organisation La Repubblica, McDonnell said that the normal process, in the event of the prime minister losing a no-confidence vote, was for the leader of the opposition to form a government and that most other opposition parties, like the SNP, accepted that. He acknowledged that the Lib Dems were resisting the idea that Corbyn should be elected PM in these circumstances, but he added: \u201cI don\u2019t think that [position] will last very long.\u201d Having someone else lead an interim government \u201cwouldn\u2019t work\u201d, McDonnell went on. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t gain support of Labour MPs, full stop,\u201d he said. In the event of Johnson losing a confidence vote, McDonnell said that Corbyn should be allowed to form a government and \u201cthe other opposition parties will then have to make their minds up because if they don\u2019t swing their support behind Jeremy Corbyn, they will be blamed for the no-deal.\u201d Corbyn has said that he wants to call a confidence vote when he has the best chance of winning, and that if be became PM he would form a \u201cstrictly time-limited, temporary government\u201d to extend article 50 and then call a general election. Asked if McDonnell\u2019s comments marked a shift in the party\u2019s position, a senior party source said that he was just reflecting reality and that the idea of anyone other than Corbyn leading an interim government was \u201cnot a realistic prospect\u201d. In an interview on the Andrew Marr Show, the shadow attorney general, Shami Chakrabarti, said that the idea of installing the Speaker as head of an interim government was just a \u201cfantasy football\u201d option and \u201cvery unlikely\u201d. But, when asked if she was saying Corbyn would never accept anyone else taking over as caretaker PM, she replied: \u201cI\u2019m not saying that.

      "body": "<p>Sixty years ago, when Caribbean migration to the UK peaked, the BBC produced a handy little booklet \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/bbc-pamphlet-going-to-Britain\" title=\"\">Going to Britain?</a> \u2013 as a guide to what new arrivals might expect. \u201cIn the shop or in the store, wherever you go you will most likely find people standing one behind the other waiting for service,\u201d readers were told. \u201cThey call this line a queue, and your place in this \u2018Q\u2019 is Z \u2013 that is at the end of the line.\u201d</p> <p>The black and white cover photo featured a neat, pensive young woman at a London train station, beside a pile of suitcases that seem suddenly to have become too cumbersome for her to carry. She has the bearing of a schoolteacher, but the suggestion of fastidiousness draws attention to the one real oddity: her overcoat is two or three sizes too big. She is emblematic of the times and of the women I interviewed for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/29/homecoming-colin-grant-windrush-betrayal-amelia-gentleman-review\" title=\"\">Homecoming: Voices of the Windrush Generation</a>. The book will be published into an environment that is still full of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/02/nhs-doctor-mu-chun-chiang-faces-deportation-visa-application-error\" title=\"\">toxic narratives around immigration</a>, and at a time when the Home Office has failed to learn lessons from what has become known as the -<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/18/home-office-immigration-windrush-applications-assessments-persecution\" title=\"\">Windrush scandal</a>. </p> <p>Setting out from the Caribbean in the 1950s and 60s, many could not conceive of snow, and winter coats were almost impossible to acquire. Such women remind me of my mother, Ethlyn, and all of her Caribbean peers memorialised in the book. These giants of my childhood were extraordinary dreamers and romancers who had dared to travel 4,000 miles to a place they had only imagined from arcane ceremonies carried out by governors and other colonial officials, from Path\u00e9 newsreels and from the West Indian Reader textbooks sent from England. Some, such as George Mangar, were better prepared. Mangar\u2019s mother packed 100 shirts into a travelling trunk when he left British Guiana (now Guyana). In his first winter in frosty Britain, he wore three at a time. Others were more cavalier. \u201cSummerwear\u201d got his nickname following his determination on leaving Jamaica to wear light summer suits in England no matter the weather, come hail or storm. \u201cWhatever became of Summerwear?\u201d I asked Ethlyn when researching the book. \u201cWell,\u201d she said, \u201cwithin a few months he caught a chill and died.\u201d</p> <p>Growing up in 1970s Luton, I was always impressed by what I considered a West Indian code \u2013 the phlegmatic shrug and the great store of humour that eased their passage through life. Struggling to find work in a prejudicial environment, one man was often informed that it was \u201ca terrible shame but you\u2019ve just turned up a little too late\u201d. His wry assessment of the news was typically West Indian: \u201cBoy, the Englishman is the nicest man out when he\u2019s telling you \u2018no\u2019.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/14/scale-misery-devastating-inside-story-reporting-windrush-scandal\">Chased into 'self-deportation': the most disturbing Windrush case so far</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Faced with rejection, West Indians mostly pulled up the collar of their coats and walked on \u2013 at least that was their initial remembrance as I sat down with them. The palpable veil of respectability, which descended almost as soon as I began to record them, was testament to the peculiar reserve and reticence among West Indians of my parents\u2019 generation to share information. \u201cMe don\u2019t like chat people\u2019s business\u201d is a phrase you\u2019ll often hear in West Indian households. But perhaps because of my Jamaican background, when interviewing these octogenarians that guardedness dissolved as they immersed themselves in reminiscences. They soon reverted to the kind of salty, mischievous and thrilling behaviour that took me back to the 60s and 70s.</p> <p>The poet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/17/derek-walcott-obituary\" title=\"\">Derek Walcott</a> once asserted: \u201cAll Port of Spain is a noon-day show.\u201d As a child that same vibrancy was evident at almost any gathering I attended of Caribbean people. They were a contrast to the British, who seemed to have worked out that the whole point to life was to proceed, with as little fuss as possible, towards death. Yet in the 70s, our Caribbeanness rarely found expression outside of the four walls that bound us. </p> <p>Even so, I\u2019ve long felt the Caribbean influence in Britain.

      "bodyText": "Sixty years ago, when Caribbean migration to the UK peaked, the BBC produced a handy little booklet \u2013 Going to Britain? \u2013 as a guide to what new arrivals might expect. \u201cIn the shop or in the store, wherever you go you will most likely find people standing one behind the other waiting for service,\u201d readers were told. \u201cThey call this line a queue, and your place in this \u2018Q\u2019 is Z \u2013 that is at the end of the line.\u201d The black and white cover photo featured a neat, pensive young woman at a London train station, beside a pile of suitcases that seem suddenly to have become too cumbersome for her to carry. She has the bearing of a schoolteacher, but the suggestion of fastidiousness draws attention to the one real oddity: her overcoat is two or three sizes too big. She is emblematic of the times and of the women I interviewed for Homecoming: Voices of the Windrush Generation. The book will be published into an environment that is still full of toxic narratives around immigration, and at a time when the Home Office has failed to learn lessons from what has become known as the -Windrush scandal. Setting out from the Caribbean in the 1950s and 60s, many could not conceive of snow, and winter coats were almost impossible to acquire. Such women remind me of my mother, Ethlyn, and all of her Caribbean peers memorialised in the book. These giants of my childhood were extraordinary dreamers and romancers who had dared to travel 4,000 miles to a place they had only imagined from arcane ceremonies carried out by governors and other colonial officials, from Path\u00e9 newsreels and from the West Indian Reader textbooks sent from England. Some, such as George Mangar, were better prepared. Mangar\u2019s mother packed 100 shirts into a travelling trunk when he left British Guiana (now Guyana). In his first winter in frosty Britain, he wore three at a time. Others were more cavalier. \u201cSummerwear\u201d got his nickname following his determination on leaving Jamaica to wear light summer suits in England no matter the weather, come hail or storm. \u201cWhatever became of Summerwear?\u201d I asked Ethlyn when researching the book. \u201cWell,\u201d she said, \u201cwithin a few months he caught a chill and died.\u201d Growing up in 1970s Luton, I was always impressed by what I considered a West Indian code \u2013 the phlegmatic shrug and the great store of humour that eased their passage through life. Struggling to find work in a prejudicial environment, one man was often informed that it was \u201ca terrible shame but you\u2019ve just turned up a little too late\u201d. His wry assessment of the news was typically West Indian: \u201cBoy, the Englishman is the nicest man out when he\u2019s telling you \u2018no\u2019.\u201d Faced with rejection, West Indians mostly pulled up the collar of their coats and walked on \u2013 at least that was their initial remembrance as I sat down with them. The palpable veil of respectability, which descended almost as soon as I began to record them, was testament to the peculiar reserve and reticence among West Indians of my parents\u2019 generation to share information. \u201cMe don\u2019t like chat people\u2019s business\u201d is a phrase you\u2019ll often hear in West Indian households. But perhaps because of my Jamaican background, when interviewing these octogenarians that guardedness dissolved as they immersed themselves in reminiscences. They soon reverted to the kind of salty, mischievous and thrilling behaviour that took me back to the 60s and 70s. The poet Derek Walcott once asserted: \u201cAll Port of Spain is a noon-day show.\u201d As a child that same vibrancy was evident at almost any gathering I attended of Caribbean people. They were a contrast to the British, who seemed to have worked out that the whole point to life was to proceed, with as little fuss as possible, towards death. Yet in the 70s, our Caribbeanness rarely found expression outside of the four walls that bound us. Even so, I\u2019ve long felt the Caribbean influence in Britain. Recently my ears pricked up when listening to PJ Harvey\u2019s Let England Shake. One of that album\u2019s most stunning tracks derives its power from the reggae chorus of Niney the Observer\u2019s Blood and Fire: \u201cthere is no more water to put out the fire, let it burn, let it burn\u201d. It might very well be an anthem for our times, heralding the embrace of chaos which borders on nihilism. Going to Britain? could not have prepared the West Indian pioneers for this moment, nor for the fact that, 60 years after their arrival, some of them would be scandalously deported. Joyce Trotman, now aged 91, gives an overview of how British West Indians have been cast since her arrival in 1954. \u201cFirst we were children of empire, then citizens of the Commonwealth, and now foreigners and immigrants.\u201d Those who found themselves ejected from the bosom of the motherland were further insulted by the cultural advice offered by British officials about what to expect on arrival back in Jamaica. Lesson one was how to \u201csound Jamaican\u201d and not to attract attention to their Britishness. The sense of shame of these insulted black Britons is compounded by the notion that you left the Caribbean poor, with a desire to travel to Britain to better yourself; you were not expected to return empty and broken. \u201cRespect\u201d is the most important word in the Jamaican lexicon. To ensure that a mess like the Windrush scandal never happens again, the government should empty the coffers of the Treasury and give the forced returnees whatever sum might assuage their pain. The financial consequences must be such that officials would think twice in the future. And while we\u2019re at it, let\u2019s strip those enforcers of the hostile environment policy of any honours they may subsequently have received. Perhaps no level of apology can compensate for the humiliation inflicted. But 60 years on from Going to Britain? we will have reached a dangerous point if there\u2019s an absence of water to put out the fire of resentment that burns in the bosom of all of us, ashamed at the reckless and callous treatment of the most vulnerable members of the Windrush generation. \u2022 Colin Grant is the author of Homecoming: Voices of the Windrush Generation",

      "bodyText": "Right then, that\u2019s absolutely us. Enjoy the rest of the weekend \u2013 ta-ra. Otherwise, that\u2019s nearly us. Join John Brewin for Newcastle United v Manchester United... That was an absolute jazzer of an early afternoon. It\u2019s only October but already City are in all sorts \u2013 they\u2019ve lost two of their first eight games and trail Liverpool by eight points. It\u2019s a long way back and, at the very least, they\u2019ll probably need to beat Liverpool twice to have a chance of making it three in a row. But it\u2019s not all about that: Wolves were excellent, and what a week it\u2019s been for them. After a sketchy start to the season, they\u2019re back. Chelsea, meanwhile, are purring. Their solidity in midfield gives them such freedom in attack, and their finishing is very, very good at the moment. Southampton, meanwhile defended like children, and if they don\u2019t sort it out they\u2019re going to struggle. As for Arsenal, they move up to third but today\u2019s effort did nothing to suggest that Unai Emery has a plan. They might improve, they might not. As for Bournemouth, they\u2019ll play worse and win. Unconvincing from Arsenal. Bournemouth played well in the second half and looked more likely to equalise than Arsenal did to clinch it, but couldn\u2019t quite make it happen. A brilliant performance and result from Wolves, who were the better side in the first half, before holding it down in the second then taking their chances brilliantly. Nuno has done such a job with Adama Traore. An absolute photostat! Again Jimenez finds Traore and again he keeps the head, steadying himself as a challenge comes in to slot past Ederson inside that same near post! Brilliant from Wolves, and is City\u2019s title nearly gone already?! Callum Wilson finds space for a shot with two minutes left of injury-time, but drills too close to Leno. Chelsea now have 18 goals in their last seven league games and move up to fifth in the table. Five additional minutes at the Etihad.... At St Mary\u2019s, the away end are serenading their manager, and it has to be said he\u2019s playing a tricky hand with no little skill. It\u2019s fair to acknowledge that he has decent senior pros to hold things together for the youngsters, but he\u2019s got his team playing with purpose and poise. I\u2019d been waiting for this: it\u2019s Pete Higginson again! \u201cYou must admit that though I admittedly have the predictive powers of a chicken\u2019s entrails, this was a good one (apart from the fact that it wasn\u2019t Cutrone).\u201d I do indeed. Wolves have been well worth the win, assuming they hang on. At the Emirates, Steve Cook has just headed a corner over the top. Nice from Chelsea, Batshuayi into Pulisic who plays a clever return into the box, and Batshuayi is right there to slam past Gunn. He\u2019s had better days. \u201cWhat makes Figo Does Guilford even more bizarre is there is an astronaut heading towards him, with almost threatening intent,\u201d says Ben Bennett. The teams for our 4.30pm kick-off are in. Newcastle: Dubravka, Clark, Schar, Lascelles, Willems, Yedlin, S Longstaff, M Longstaff, Saint-Maximin, Almiron, Joelinton. Subs: Darlow, Dummett, Carroll, Shelvey, Gayle, Krafth, Atsu. Manchester United: De Gea, Young, Maguire, Dalot, Tuanzebe, Fred, McTominay, Pereira, Mata, James, Rashford. Subs: Romero, Rojo, Greenwood, Gomes, Matic, Chong, Williams. That Manchester United effort is an absolute abomination. You can follow along here, with John Brewin. Eight points at this stage of the season is a huge lead, and if City can\u2019t score, that\u2019s the deficit they\u2019ll be facing. Liverpool have started the season with the swagger of a team who know, and if City drop points again before they do, it\u2019ll be close to over. Cancelo plays a poor pass and Jimenez counters, squaring to Traore at precisely the right moment! And Traore draws Ederson - it\u2019s a pretty good likeness too! \u2013 opens his body and slots inside the near post! Lovely goal, beautifully taken. Double change for Southampton: Ings and Redmond off, Adams and Boufal on. That should sort it. At the Etihad, Jonny is on for Cutrone - Wolves will take their point now - and Jesus is on for David Silva - City won\u2019t. \u201cIt seems Man City players are finally getting yellows for those \u2018tactical fouls\u2019 they absolutely do not commit at all,\u201d says Ian Copestake. \u201cEver.\u201d I don\u2019t object to them doing it. The question is whether the laws need amending in some way to prevent it from being done. Ander Herrera was sent off at Chelsea the season before last when he and his team-mates took it in turns to foul Eden Hazard. The ref seemed to indicate his second yellow was on behalf of everyone. \u201cMe again,\u201d sayd Tim Martin, \u201cyes a lack of a plan and Aubameyang gets goals buzettet Laca is the guy we need to break teams down. Defenders don\u2019t like playing against him.\u201d If I was playing centre-back I\u2019d much prefer Lacazette, who isn\u2019t going to run in behind or turn me around. He\u2019s a decent player, but as someone who supports a team competing against Arsenal, one I\u2019m very happy for them to have. Gundogan has just been booked for a foul \u2013 that\u2019s four yellows for City today. City have a free-kick just outside the box, right of centre ... and David Silva strokes against the bar! That was beautifully hit, and the closest his team have come to a goal, by far. Yoshida\u2019s assets are in his mouth when Alonso punches across the six-yard box and his touch isn\u2019t sure, but it sends the ball behind and the corner comes to nowt. Perfectly normal behaviours. It\u2019s been relatively quiet at St Mary\u2019s, but I\u2019d still expect another Chelsea goal at some point. At \u201cEmirates Stadium\u201d, Bournemouth are giving Arsenal plenty; Luiz just had to slide away a King cross, the resultant corner coming to nothing. I\u2019m not having that Ozil wouldn\u2019t be useful for Arsenal right about now. Bournemouth home is his perfect game. Bernardo Silva and Guardiola are deep in touchline discussion. I\u2019d expect Mahrez to be hooked not long from now ... and there it is. \u201cCan VAR be used to reassess Brexit?\u201d asks Ian Copestake. I think that needs DRS, put in place to \u201celiminate against the howler\u201d. City press at the Etihad, but when Mahrez curls in a corner, Rui Patricio punches clear. They\u2019re missing Leroy Sane\u00e9 something fierce. Southampton have a free-kick just outside the D, Ward-Prowse - who did a pre-match spot with Matt Le Tissier on this precise thing - behind it. He curls over. \u201cKroenke run all his teams (here in US) as businesses,\u201d says Damian Durrant. \u201cThey are not passion projects and nor frankly do they win trophies much -- but they make money. A cChampions League spot and the moolah they results is the benchmark for Unai. I think he has to end of this season to at least get very close.\u201d Yes, agreed \u2013 if Arsenal miss the top four again, that\u2019ll probably be it for him. Bournemouth are giving Arsenal agita now, Wilson dashing into the box and forcing Leno to tip over after shooting from a tight angle. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong that City will improve,\u201d says Peter Higg. \u201cI\u2019m predicting a 1-0 to Wolves especially when Cutrone gets his scoring boots on. Then, as we climb the table, we storm to victory in Europe and Nuno is made a Wolverhampton saint!\u201d There it is. At the Etihad, Rodri is booked for fouling Cutrone and the ref books Cancelo at the same time, for an earlier foul on Neves. Liverpool will be loving this. Meanwhile, Bournemouth rip into Arsenal, Solanke sliding in Wilson who skates beyond the defence! He could screw a shot from a tight angle but opts to square instead, unable to pick out a team-mate. Willlian stamps on the gas and moves from right to centre, sliding in Hudson-Odoi! His first touch is perhaps a little heavy but he still opens his body to shoot ... only to punch straight at Gunn\u2019s extended foot. That needed lifting. Aubameyang runs at the Bournemouth defence, but is stopped by a well-timed sliding tackle - I\u2019m not sure whose, though. And everywhere else. Back underway at St Mary\u2019s. \u201cDo the former abusers of Jorginho now get his obvious brilliance?\u201d asks Duncan Edwards. \u201cTogether with Kante, Chelsea have two fabulous midfield players who would improve any team in the country. As a Man United fan I\u2019m jealous. Mason Mount has a pair of model professionals to learn from.\u201d I definitely think playing in a two helps him, but if I was an opposing striker I\u2019d still be looking to rush him at every opportunity. But yes, I agree that Sarri\u2019s method was not great. I should have noted that Arsenal almost had a penalty \u2013 VAR decided Pepe hadn\u2019t been fouled in the box. It was very close, and probably more yes than no, but tricky to overrule. Wolves are not a good matchup for City, not their passing equals but pretty nifty at it, and taking all the pace out of the game. They\u2019ve had three good chances and will be disappointed not to be in front; City will surely improve after the break. Southampton have played pretty well, except for the fact that their defending would turn milk. Chelsea haven\u2019t played especially well, but they\u2019re so confident going forward and will expect to score a few more in the second half. It\u2019s been one-way traffic at the Emirates, with Arsenal dominant though struggling to create. In the final minute at the Etihad, Walker fancies himself a shy, driving low, but Rui Patricio is there to collect. In injury-time at St Mary\u2019s, Tomori tries to dribble his way out of trouble before flicking a backpass that Ings seizes upon! But his first touch forces him wide such that when he shoots, he can beat Kepa but not Jorginho, whose slide saves the livener. But of course! Maybe Emery and Solskjaer are doing similar jobs: demolition, before someone skilled comes in to decorate. \u201cI hear what you say but disagree with the idea Emery doesn\u2019t promote the younger players,\u201d says Tim Martin. \u201cI know Lacazette is injured but we have seen Saka start a few times and there are others in defence and midfield around the 20 year-old mark. I see Emery as a good start to challenge again but you\u2019re right about more magic needed to win a big one.\u201d I\u2019m not saying he doesn\u2019t play the younger players, I\u2019m saying it\u2019s hard to discern a coherent plan. I actually think Lacazette\u2019s injury was a blessing in disguise \u2013 not a point I enjoy making \u2013 but Aubameyang is better and can now play through the middle, with proper wide men either side. The fiddling wasn\u2019t helping anyone. It never rains but sometimes it destroys your life. Just as Southampton are threatening a comeback, Kante takes a pass from Alonso and shoots down Gunn\u2019s throat, then a looping deflection off Bednarek leaves him grabbing air. \u201cI disagree with almost everything Daniel Taylor or Mark Kerry have written (the exception being that Ozil should be on the bench),\u201d says Jan Wetzel. \u201cPossibly because I don\u2019t subscribe to this all or nothing \u2018now\u2019 thinking. The PL is a 2 horse race at the moment, which puts \u2018competing at the top\u2019 in relative terms. It\u2019s still Pepe\u2019s first season, and the speed of passing the front three can muster is almost City-esque. Arsenal often play better second halves because Emery can read a game and doesn\u2019t fear change, something Wenger refused. If Arsenal comes in at 3rd or 4th I will consider this a successful and improved season.\u201d Nah, I\u2019m not having that. City\u2019s front three is in a different postcode to Arsenal\u2019s, and if you have to keep changing team and tactics for the second half it means you got them wrong in the first place. It\u2019s not about needing things now, it\u2019s about seeing nothing in a manager that makes you think they\u2019ve got what it takes to ever get there. Wolves have had by far the better of the chances at the Etihad, but haven\u2019t scored. I fear for them. As I was saying! Valery takes a tap from Redmond and somehow sashays between four tackles, or \u201ctackles\u201d \u2013 in the studio, Graeme Souness rubs thighs \u2013 squares, and Ings slides home. Game on! Another defensive error from Southampton, Long passing straight to Mount, has Hasenhuttl shaking his head on the touchline. But when Abraham tees up his pal, Mount sweeps wide. Southampton are going to get gubbed here if they don\u2019t start paying attention. At the Etihad, Jimenez intercepts a typically useless pass from Otamendi and dashes goalwards! But he dithers, narrowing his own angle and allowing Fernandinho to buffet him from behind. It\u2019s enough to knock him down, and another opportunity evapor8s. Something is happening here! Southampton make about 687 consecutive errors clearing the ball but Chelsea savage them with an absolute absence of ruth, Jorginho finding Willian who slips through to Mount. He takes a touch, has a look and absolutely lamps past Gunn from close range. Southampton have started well here, but here they are! Mahrez gives it away and Wolves break, Jimenez beating Rodri then walloping a shot that Fernandinho blocks. But Cutrone picks up the loose ball and rifles goalwards! But Fernandinho dives to block again! \u2018Is Tammy Abraham going to Harry Kane me,\u201d says Niall Mullen \u201cby being actually good after I\u2019ve been saying he\u2019s useless for ages?\u201d There\u2019s more than a whiff of that isn\u2019t there? His finishing has been so smooth so you could argue that he won\u2019t score as many hard ones next season, or use it as evidence that he\u2019s a class act. I\u2019ve not seen enough to be sure. \u201cI love Frank Lampard as much as the next Blues fan,\u201d tweets @Rosscommon_cat, \u201cbut his ability to speak the obvious has been a revelation this year. His answers are cringeworthy in their straightforwardness. Can Jos\u00e9 do his pressers?\u201d An in-form Mourinho is a glorious thing \u2013 I hope he relocates his mojo. Chelsea had done nothing in the game prior to then, but when you\u2019ve got a striker playing with such brio, all you need is a sniff. A clipped ball over the top sees Gunn and Yoshida leave leave it to each other. That, Abraham cannot have, and he insinuates himself between them to flick over the former; the latter does his best to hack off the line, but ball was well over. What a finish that is! David Silva crosses from the left, but Vinagre heads away before Mahrez can head for goal. Meanwhile, Saiss, who was down earlier, is down again and that\u2019ll be his afternoon I\u2019m afraid. Ryan Bennett replaces him. Kante snaps into Long, who slips in the challenge and stays down for a while, but he limps back to his feet and should be ok. Long pulls Azipilcueta\u2019s shorts and makes off with the ball, megging Kante for good measure ... so Jorginho slides straight through him and is booked. Southampton are putting it on Chelsea, but Hudson-Odoi then runs the channel and cuts back to Abraham, who drills a low shot just wide. He\u2019s playing with so much confidence. Pepe cirls in a corner from the right and Luiz, running across towards the front post, is up earliest, glancing gently across Ramdsdale and into the far corner. \u201cIs it just me,\u201d wonders Gary Naylor, \u201cor does it feel like Liverpool should be first, Manchester City second, Newcastle 20th and everyone else 10th? It feels like a Wacky Races dusty mass finish is coming in May, with Penelope Pitstop having already won and Dick Dastardly coming in last.\u201d The answer is nearly always yes, but I agree: there are two good sides in the league \u2013 there aren\u2019t many more in world football \u2013 and a lot of dross. Aubameyang takes possession outside the box, left of centre, and flings his entire corporeality into a shot which screeches wide of the far post. City press Wolves, and Steerling botches a chance to square for Mahrez. It\u2019s a tricky one, Mahrez finally playing well, because it means Sterling has to swap flanks. At Arsenal, a bit of early pressure from the home side led to Guedouzi forcing a corner, which came to nothing. \u201cThe Ozil situation is just the tip of the iceberg,\u201d says Mark Kerry. \u201cEmery has been in charge over a year now and there has been absolutely no improvement in the team since the late Wenger era. I actually think they\u2019re worse. He never picks the same 11 and couldn\u2019t pick a captain til last week. This indecision has spread to making Ozil a captain... but not playing him. And no matter what your thoughts are on that player being a long term solution at Arsenal, it would surely be beneficial to all parties (fans, manager, players) to at least have him on the bench, as he can be a very potent attacking threat. Emery does not have a clue, it\u2019d be great to see him go in January.\u201d Yeah, I agree with that, pretty much. To make Arsenal competitive at the top will require a genius or close, and Emery isn\u2019t that. He does have good young players coming through, but is naturally cautious which doesn\u2019t suit what he\u2019s got, and why he can\u2019t settle on an XI or a style. Have a look! Hojbjerg finds Redmond and Alonso back off, so Redmond absolutely clatters a drive that flies just over the top. In east Manchester, Pep Guardiola salutes the crowd. Off we go! At St Mary\u2019s, the players are on their way out! Flamethrowers are involved, which really brings home to me the previously unfathomable import of proceedings. Email! \u201cFeels kinda like a Lerma red card day to me,\u201d says JR in Illinois. \u201cI suppose most days feel like Lerma red card days to me but I just woke up and it was the first thought I had when seeing the lineups.\u201d Ok, I\u2019m going to go for Steve Cook. Frank Lampard says he\u2019s had to be careful with Hudson-Odoi given the severity of his injury, but says he\u2019s ready. His team always try to be adaptable, so it\u2019s not big deal to change to four at the back \u2013 different games pose different challenges \u2013 and he\u2019s expecting a hard game. Southampton are 16th in the table at the moment, a circumstance they\u2019ll find slightly worrying. They\u2019re better than that \u2013 ok, they can\u2019t be because the table tells us they can\u2019t be \u2013 but they have the potential for more. They need to find themselves some goals as a matter of urgency, but today I\u2019d expect them to sit tight and try to shade a low-scorer. I think Inter brought in 12 players this summer. They\u2019re currently top of Serie A. On Sky a little earlier, Gary Neville was talking about how Manchester United \u2013 who play Newcastle later \u2013 need a few windows to rebuild, and I must say I do not see why. Or I do, but he didn\u2019t give us the reason. United make enough money to buy all they need in one or two, it\u2019s just they have owners whose focus is filling their pockets, not having a winning football team. You\u2019ve got to laugh. That contract they gave him has got to be one of the all-time worst calls, though I do find it weird that Emery can\u2019t find a use for him. Given Tierney is on the bench, would he really be of less use than Maitland-Niles? Nicolas Pepe, then: is he any use? I was surprised by the excitement when Arsenal bought him on the basis that not many people spend that much of their time watching Lille, so who could say with certainty how good he was? Also, he\u2019d had one decent season in a league whose standard is not all that, and no other club wanted to stump up for him. None this means he\u2019s not brilliant, of course, but I was suspicious. Anyway, he\u2019s been absolutely rotten every time I\u2019ve watched Arsenal this season and was properly shown up by Saka on Monday night. He badly needs a performance and a goal that isn\u2019t a sympathy goal \u2013 I guess his manager\u2019s fate is tied to his fate, which is why he\u2019s not been dropped yet, but he can\u2019t be far off. Unai Emery largely returns to the side who were horrible at Old Trafford on Monday, rather than the one who were much improved against Liege on Thursday. The full-backs change again, Bellerin and Tierney dropping out with Chambers and Kolasinac coming in; I\u2019m not sure those two will be playing league football for very much longer. Then, in midfield, Ceballos retains his spot with Xhaka and Guendouzi returning, meaning Torreira has to sit at the side; then, up front, it\u2019s back to OT, with Saka, Aubameyang and Pepe in again. Bournemouth are unchanged. Pep Guardiola makes two changes from the midweek cruise against Dinamo Zagreb: Mendy is replaced by Walker and Sterling comes in for Bernardo. Wolves, meanwhile, who had a great win at Besiktas on Thursday, change the wing-backs as you might expect, Jonny and Doherty replaced by Vinagre and Traore, with Dendoncker and Cutrone also coming in, for Neto and Gibbs-White. So what does it all mean? Southampton make one change from last weekend\u2019s humiliating defeat to the ten men of Spurs, Boufal dropping out and Long coming in. I guess that\u2019s Ralf Hasenhuttl looking for graft rather than guile. Chelsea, meanwhile, leave out James, bringing in Hudson-Odoi. This is probably close to Lampard\u2019s first XI, and I reckon they\u2019ll move from 3-4-2-1 to 4-3-3. Southampton (what looks like a sophisticate\u2019s 4-2-2-2): Gunn; Bertrand, Bednarek, Yoshida, Valery; Hojbjerg, Romeu; Ward-Prowse, Redmond; Ings, Long. Subs: McCarthy, Stephens, Adams, Arsmtrong, Boufal, Obafemi, Danso. Chelsea (a getting it 4-2-3-1): Arrizabalaga; Azpilicueta, Zouma, Tomori, Alonso; Kante, Jorginho; Willian, Mount, Hudson-Odoi; Abraham. Subs: Caballero, Christensen, Barkley, Kovacic, Pulisic, Batshuayi, James. ** Manchester City (an implacable 4-3-3): Ederson; Walker, Otamendi, Fernandinho, Cancelo; Rodri, Gundogan, D.Silva; Mahrez, Aguero, Sterling. Subs: Bravo, Jesus, Zinchenko, Angelino, B.Silva, Foden, Garcia. Wolverhampton Wanderers (a formulaic 3-5-2): Rui Patricio; Boly, Coady, Saiss; Dendoncker, Joao Moutinho, Vinagre, Neves, Traore; Cutrone, Jimenez. Subs: Ruddy, Doherty, Vallejo, Bennett, Gibbs-White, Jonny, Kilman. ** Arsenal (a settling 4-3-3): Leno; Chambers, Sokratis, Luiz, Kolasinac; Guendouzi, Xhaka, Ceballos; Saka, Aubameyang, Pepe. Subs: Martinez, Tierney, Torreira, Maitland-Niles, Holding, Willock, Martinello. AFC Bournemouth (a cultured 4-4-2): Ramsdale; Stacey, Ake, Steve Cook, Rico; Harry Wilson, Billing, Lerma, King; Solanke, Callum Wilson. Subs: Boruc, Francis, Surman, Groeneveld, Lewis Cook, Fraser, Kelly. Right, let\u2019s get on with some team news... Afternoon all. A triptych of techniquing awaits us this afternoon, with three fixtures featuring six teams, all of whom will endeavour to play the game most commonly known as \u201cproper football\u201d. At St Mary\u2019s, Southampton will look to pass their way around Frank Lampard\u2019s Franklampardschelsea, whose fast, attacking style is doing pretty nicely at the moment; at the Emirates, Arsenal will look to recapture the flowing, youthful brio that wasted Standard Liege in midweek; and at the Etihad, Manchester City will seek to impose their hyper-speed passing on Wolves\u2019 slowmotion passing, thereby closing the gap at the top of the table to a mere five points. And it\u2019s live! Kick-offs (or kicks-off): 2pm BST",

A City foray broke down and Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez made a mug of Otamendi then found the Spaniard, who showed plenty of composure with his finish.

Now, the Argentinian hit a second loose City pass. Again, Jim\u00e9nez was the beneficiary. This time a combination of Fernandinho and Ederson kept the scores level, the No 9 ending on top of the latter in a sight reminiscent of mixed-martial arts.</p> <p>Guardiola has discussed the need to be more solid at the back with regard to eliminating \u201cclear chances\u201d. What he was witnessing was City proving most at sea since Stones went down last month.</p> <p>Five successive victories and only one goal conceded had followed. Yet when Jim\u00e9nez skated past Jo\u00e3o Cancelo along the right and crossed, the ball travelled across the area to the unmarked R\u00faben Vinagre as more gaps were exposed. City rushed towards the winger, though, and a shot that might have troubled Ederson was deflected away.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2e1a7b3bb30e5ca5d741c3893e8934058340d47\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2e1a7b3bb30e5ca5d741c3893e8934058340d47/108_365_3386_2032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manchester City players are disconsolate after Wolves\u2019 second goal guaranteed their defeat\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manchester City players are disconsolate after Wolves\u2019 second goal guaranteed their defeat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Attack-as-defence is a truism of Guardiola\u2019s virtuoso side, one he cited in the buildup. The problem, though, was a lack of a consistent edge near Patr\u00edcio\u2019s goal. When the blue wave next went at Wolves Raheem Sterling did cause the goalkeeper to beat the ball out. More encouragement came via a Cancelo shot, a Sergio Ag\u00fcero header back at goal, and a Silva cross. Yet, Wolves held firm. As Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo noted afterwards his players pressing in numbers caused City to hurry. When Cancelo collected in front of the Wolves D, four black-shirted opponents stymied him.</p> <p>By the break City could reflect on a late Kyle Walker attempt, saved by Patr\u00edcio, but the vulnerability in the rearguard was their glaring problem.</p> <p>The City full-back, recovering from an infection, was replaced by Oleksandr Zinchenko for the second half. This meant Cancelo going to right-back and the Ukrainian taking his berth.</p> <p>City, though, remained open to the counterattack. A Cutrone burst had Rodri scything him down, causing Craig Pawson to book the midfielder, the referee also showing yellow to Cancelo for an infringement earlier in the move.</p> <p>If J\u00fcrgen Klopp and his Liverpool players were watching the conclusion was clear: City lacked the vibrancy and ruthlessness that had swept them to the last two titles.</p> <p>If J\u00fcrgen Klopp and his Liverpool players were watching the conclusion was clear. City are lacking the vibrancy and ruthlessness that has swept them to their last two titles. The stuttering display had Guardiola introducing Bernardo Silva for Mahrez on the hour. Yet City frustration continued. David Silva seemed to make a fair challenge near Wolves\u2019 area but Pawson gave a foul. Nuno\u2019s men moved upfield and won a corner. Ederson complained about the initial decision and was booked.</p> <p>There was better when David Silva crashed a free-kick off Patr\u00edcio\u2019s bar and in the ensuing action the same player went close with a hooked effort.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-table element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://frontend.gutools.co.uk/admin/football/tables/league/100/top\"> <table data-embed-type=\"table\" class=\"table table--football table--striped\"> <thead> <tr> <th class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\"><abbr title=\"Position\">Pos</abbr></th> <th class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Team</th> <th class=\"football-stat--played\"><abbr title=\"Played\">P</abbr></th> <th class=\"football-stat--difference\"><abbr title=\"Goal difference\">GD</abbr></th> <th class=\"football-stat--points\"><abbr title=\"Points\">Pts</abbr></th> </tr> </thead> <tbody>  <tr class=\" \"> <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">1</td> <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Liverpool</td> <td class=\"football-stat--played\">8</td> <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">14</td> <td class=\"football-stat--points\">24</td> </tr>  <tr class=\" \"> <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">2</td> <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Man City</td> <td class=\"football-stat--played\">8</td> <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">18</td> <td class=\"football-stat--points\">16</td> </tr>  <tr class=\" \"> <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">3</td> <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Arsenal</td> <td class=\"football-stat--played\">8</td> <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">2</td> <td class=\"football-stat--points\">15</td> </tr>  <tr class=\" \"> <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">4</td> <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Leicester</td> <td class=\"football-stat--played\">8</td> <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">7</td> <td class=\"football-stat--points\">14</td> </tr>  <tr class=\" \"> <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">5</td> <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Chelsea</td> <td class=\"football-stat--played\">8</td> <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">4</td> <td class=\"football-stat--points\">14</td> </tr>  </tbody> </table> </figure>  <p>Guardiola\u2019s final substitution was telling: on came Gabriel Jesus \u2013 not for Ag\u00fcero but David Silva, the manager feeling the need for both strikers.</p> <p>It yielded nothing as this ended as the black-shirted Wolves\u2019 first league triumph over City in nine years.

Guardiola has discussed the need to be more solid at the back with regard to eliminating \u201cclear chances\u201d. What he was witnessing was City proving most at sea since Stones went down last month. Five successive victories and only one goal conceded had followed. Yet when Jim\u00e9nez skated past Jo\u00e3o Cancelo along the right and crossed, the ball travelled across the area to the unmarked R\u00faben Vinagre as more gaps were exposed. City rushed towards the winger, though, and a shot that might have troubled Ederson was deflected away. Attack-as-defence is a truism of Guardiola\u2019s virtuoso side, one he cited in the buildup. The problem, though, was a lack of a consistent edge near Patr\u00edcio\u2019s goal. When the blue wave next went at Wolves Raheem Sterling did cause the goalkeeper to beat the ball out. More encouragement came via a Cancelo shot, a Sergio Ag\u00fcero header back at goal, and a Silva cross. Yet, Wolves held firm. As Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo noted afterwards his players pressing in numbers caused City to hurry. When Cancelo collected in front of the Wolves D, four black-shirted opponents stymied him. By the break City could reflect on a late Kyle Walker attempt, saved by Patr\u00edcio, but the vulnerability in the rearguard was their glaring problem. The City full-back, recovering from an infection, was replaced by Oleksandr Zinchenko for the second half. This meant Cancelo going to right-back and the Ukrainian taking his berth. City, though, remained open to the counterattack. A Cutrone burst had Rodri scything him down, causing Craig Pawson to book the midfielder, the referee also showing yellow to Cancelo for an infringement earlier in the move. If J\u00fcrgen Klopp and his Liverpool players were watching the conclusion was clear: City lacked the vibrancy and ruthlessness that had swept them to the last two titles. If J\u00fcrgen Klopp and his Liverpool players were watching the conclusion was clear. City are lacking the vibrancy and ruthlessness that has swept them to their last two titles. The stuttering display had Guardiola introducing Bernardo Silva for Mahrez on the hour. Yet City frustration continued. David Silva seemed to make a fair challenge near Wolves\u2019 area but Pawson gave a foul. Nuno\u2019s men moved upfield and won a corner. Ederson complained about the initial decision and was booked. There was better when David Silva crashed a free-kick off Patr\u00edcio\u2019s bar and in the ensuing action the same player went close with a hooked effort. Guardiola\u2019s final substitution was telling: on came Gabriel Jesus \u2013 not for Ag\u00fcero but David Silva, the manager feeling the need for both strikers. It yielded nothing as this ended as the black-shirted Wolves\u2019 first league triumph over City in nine years. Nuno\u2019s side can boast a fine victory that moves them up to mid-table while City stare at a yawning gap to Liverpool well before the clocks go back at the end of the month at the end of the month. Their two defeats make this City\u2019s poorest start since 2013-14. City finished that season as champions but were only three points behind the leaders at this stage. There is enough time to erase the current deficit but what may privately worry Guardiola is how sluggish his players look so early in the campaign. They had done so, too, at Everton last Saturday before eventually winning 3-1. This was City\u2019s first home league defeat since going down 3-2 to Crystal Palace on 22 December last year. Now, the manager will need the impending international break to regroup ahead of resuming the championship defence in a fortnight.",

Drug-related deaths rose to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/aug/15/drug-poisoning-deaths-in-england-and-wales-at-highest-level-ever-recorded\">record 4,359 </a> last year from<a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsrelatedtodrugpoisoninginenglandandwales/2013-08-28#main-findings\"> 1,496 in 2012</a> and there has been a greater focus <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/98010/recovery-roadmap.pdf\">on abstinence-based support</a> amid sustained cuts to treatment budgets.</p> <p>Stevens said the government had ignored the advice of the ACMD on how to reduce the deaths despite <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/632416/20170719-ACMD-Ministerial_Letter-Signed.pdf\">accepting a number of recommendations in 2017</a>, eight months after the <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/576560/ACMD-Drug-Related-Deaths-Report-161212.pdf\">report he co-authored was published</a>.</p> <p>His analysis of government figures showed a 27% reduction<a href=\"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/uk-drug-deaths-continue-rise-085316670.html?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAAUjw8SyP-J19gKeZVRqlbJWnbJJ6fPk5o1omk0hfnJd96_LxJvbaN2ZonZlmSb6bsWS0RkGgHYKcro3H0-JCRMly8brywhBp8inrAOZlfRruprY5Y_f-pU_JHyxVbjFszJ66W6R4_SmTtyVWF8gbL1IbbUaiwj92silk9Ugcfb1&amp;guccounter=2\"> in spending on drug treatment services</a> for adults since 2015-16.</p> <p>\u201cThe government accepted the recommendation to maintain investment in opioid-substitute therapy, but it has seen substantial cuts,\u201d Stevens said.</p> <p>\u201cBut I haven\u2019t resigned because ministers ignore advice, that is their prerogative, but because the ACMD is no longer the independent body it was when I joined it.

Stevens said he knew of at least one other person who has been barred from serving on the council after government vetting, amid growing calls for a fundamentally new approach to drug policy. \u201cI have resigned because of my concerns over the political vetting of potential members of the ACMD,\u201d he said. \u201cThese were raised at a meeting in April where I asked for the minister to provide information on how many people had been excluded from serving on the panel. I also asked for further information on what the checking process consists of.\u201d Stevens, a professor in criminal justice at the University of Kent, said the information was not provided and there was no assurance it would not happen again. He criticised the opaque vetting process, with candidates not told how they were going to be checked. \u201cThe political vetting fundamentally undermines the independence of the council,\u201d Stevens added. \u201cIt is supposed to be protected by the working protocol between the home secretary and the ACMD. This does not seem compatible if ministers exclude those who disagree with them.\u201d It emerged in June that Eastwood had been blocked from serving on the ACMD by Atkins. Although her expertise was recognised, previous tweets critical of government policy were highlighted during the vetting. Eastwood has repeatedly called for legal alternatives to the criminalisation of drug users and the introduction of drug consumption rooms. The Guardian is in contact with two other people who have claimed they were blocked from serving on the ACMD after initially being recommended. The working protocol between the home secretary and the ACMD states: \u201cThe ACMD and ministers are committed to ensuring that the best evidence-based advice is available to government on drug misuse, working together with the common purpose of reducing drug-related harms in the UK. \u201cIn doing so, ministers acknowledge the independence of the ACMD and its statutory duties.\u201d However, the government has been under pressure to adopt an evidence-based approach to drug policy. Drug-related deaths rose to a record 4,359 last year from 1,496 in 2012 and there has been a greater focus on abstinence-based support amid sustained cuts to treatment budgets. Stevens said the government had ignored the advice of the ACMD on how to reduce the deaths despite accepting a number of recommendations in 2017, eight months after the report he co-authored was published. His analysis of government figures showed a 27% reduction in spending on drug treatment services for adults since 2015-16. \u201cThe government accepted the recommendation to maintain investment in opioid-substitute therapy, but it has seen substantial cuts,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t resigned because ministers ignore advice, that is their prerogative, but because the ACMD is no longer the independent body it was when I joined it. That means I can no longer be part of the council.\u201d Six government drug advisers resigned in protest after Prof David Nutt was famously forced to step down as chair of the ACMD in 2009 after accusing ministers of \u201cdevaluing and distorting\u201d evidence during the reclassification of cannabis as a class B drug, against the advice of the council. A government spokesperson said: \u201cMinisters are responsible for appointing members to the boards of public bodies and do so in line with the governance code for public appointments. \u201cThe names of candidates are submitted to ministers following assessment by an independent advisory assessment panel. It is then for ministers to determine merit and make the final appointment. \u201cIt is important that candidates who are considered for these roles undergo appropriate checks to ensure they are suitable to hold these vital public positions\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>The orange lifebuoys that pop up at random points in the countryside are the first sign of what the naturalist Chris Packham calls the biggest deforestation project in Britain since the first world war. They hang from posts beside shallow, newly dug ponds, surrounded by neat rows of spindly saplings.</p> <p>These new landscapes are \u201ccompensation\u201d for the partial destruction of 63 ancient woods that stand in the intended path of HS2, the high-speed rail line being carved through the countryside between London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. (According to the Woodland Trust, 108 ancient woods are in the frame, when you also count those indirectly affected.) The idea is that, when the woods are felled after centuries of quiet growth, their wildlife, from great-crested newts to woodcock, may seek refuge in these new habitats.</p> <p>Although HS2 has come under review, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/03/hs2-to-be-delayed-by-up-to-five-years\" title=\"\">after its projected cost rose to \u00a388bn</a> (with the possibility it could be cancelled), \u201cenabling\u201d work for the construction effort continues. According to HS2 Ltd, the government-funded company building the line, it will destroy only a tiny fraction of England\u2019s 52,000 ancient woodlands \u2013 with 80% of \u201caffected\u201d woodlands left intact as the new line arrows through them. There will be generous compensation, it claims. But can ancient woods be replaced? And what do the people living beside these imperilled old woods think?</p> <p>South Cubbington wood in Warwickshire, on a hill above the scenic River Leam, has been fenced off in preparation for the chainsawing of old oaks and wild service trees. A deep cutting wider than a motorway will be carved through it. Beside the wood, a 250-year-old pear tree is surrounded by plastic fencing and awaiting execution. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/08/pear-tree-hs2-woodland-trust-cubbington\" title=\"\">It was crowned England\u2019s \u201ctree of the year\u201d in 2015</a>. Now, dumper trucks thunder past.</p> <p>\u201cIt breaks my heart seeing all this,\u201d says one local resident, Elaine Barker. \u201cThe wildlife won\u2019t have the freedom to go from wood to meadow to river because they\u2019ll have a great big concrete line in front of them. And neither will we. We live in Leamington Spa, one of the most polluted towns in Britain, and I have asthmatic children.

Breathe the air, <a href=\"https://www.hs2-cubbington.net\" title=\"\">says a group of Cubbington residents</a> when we enter the woods: it smells cool, damp, mushroomy. Just 2% of Britain is ancient woodland (older than 400 years, in England and Wales). It often features old trees, dead wood (a habitat for rare beetles) and flora such as native bluebells. But the key, say ecologists, is its soils \u2013 even where ancient woodland has been replanted with newer trees, its soil is still undisturbed, chemical-free and rich in fungi, micro-organisms and the seeds of future life.</p> <p>In recent months, despite a continuing review by the retired engineer Douglas Oakervee, HS2 has become increasingly visible <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/17/hs2-the-human-cost-of-britains-most-expensive-rail-project\" title=\"\">to those living near the London-Birmingham route</a>. Roads and footpaths are abruptly closed; rolling countryside is studded with the orange and yellow of diggers, and fences spring up. Construction tracks are laid down; hedgerows are grubbed up. And people have woken up. A week ago, protesters evaded security around South Cubbington to begin a peaceful protest camp. Barker is heartened. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely lovely to see the whole community coming together and saying: \u2018We don\u2019t want this.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/09/hs2woods-zip/giv-3902blyAaN6hQkkd\" data-alt=\"Map of threatened woodlands\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/09/hs2woods-zip/giv-3902blyAaN6hQkkd\">Map of threatened woodlands</a> </figure>  <p>HS2 Ltd\u2019s plans to minimise woodland destruction appear impressive. It is planting 7m trees and shrubs, creating 3,300 hectares of wildlife habitat \u2013 a third greater than there is today. Ecologists say one crucial part of ancient woodland is its (untouched, chemical-free) soil, and so in South Cubbington the forest floor will be dug up and dumped on to new sites. Ironically, the wood\u2019s imminent destruction is because winter is the most wildlife-friendly time to relocate its soil.</p> <p>But ancient woodland, says Luci Ryan, of the Woodland Trust, is irreplaceable. Every developer threatening ancient woodland (there are 995 examples of development on or beside ancient woodland) <a href=\"https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/protecting-trees-and-woods/campaign-with-us/\" title=\"\">claims theirs is just a small slice</a>; a finite resource continues to be eroded. Although the Woodland Trust says no new planting can offset the destruction of such forests, it wants a planting/loss ratio of 30:1. HS2 Ltd has not listed the precise compensation planting for each ancient woodland lost. \u201cIf we\u2019re being really generous,\u201d says Ryan, \u201cthe planting ratio is about six hectares to every one lost\u201d for phase one of the project (London to Birmingham). \u201cPeople say: \u2018It\u2019s just trees, and people are losing homes and businesses,\u2019 but the problem is the way it was designed \u2013 if HS2 Ltd had considered the ancient woods in the beginning we wouldn\u2019t be seen as unreasonable.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c3fbcfdacdfe9424108eb55c783af297b2fe95ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3fbcfdacdfe9424108eb55c783af297b2fe95ea/0_214_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The protest camp in South Cubbington.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The protest camp in South Cubbington.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The fragmentation caused by the line slicing through ancient woods is highlighted by Mike Pollard of <a href=\"http://www.banburyornithologicalsociety.org.uk/index.php\" title=\"\">Banbury Ornithological Society</a>, which owns Glyn Davies wood in Northamptonshire. \u201cWe don\u2019t have much ancient woodland in this area; only little pockets of it survive,\u201d he says as he shows me its 300-year-old oaks and the skeletons of last spring\u2019s bluebells (another sign of ancient woodland). \u201cThere\u2019s all this deadwood, old trees, two species of elm; it\u2019s a really good sample of ancient woodland.\u201d Everyone knows ancient trees can\u2019t move, but even mobile bird species will be affected, Pollard says.

      "bodyText": "The orange lifebuoys that pop up at random points in the countryside are the first sign of what the naturalist Chris Packham calls the biggest deforestation project in Britain since the first world war. They hang from posts beside shallow, newly dug ponds, surrounded by neat rows of spindly saplings. These new landscapes are \u201ccompensation\u201d for the partial destruction of 63 ancient woods that stand in the intended path of HS2, the high-speed rail line being carved through the countryside between London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. (According to the Woodland Trust, 108 ancient woods are in the frame, when you also count those indirectly affected.) The idea is that, when the woods are felled after centuries of quiet growth, their wildlife, from great-crested newts to woodcock, may seek refuge in these new habitats. Although HS2 has come under review, after its projected cost rose to \u00a388bn (with the possibility it could be cancelled), \u201cenabling\u201d work for the construction effort continues. According to HS2 Ltd, the government-funded company building the line, it will destroy only a tiny fraction of England\u2019s 52,000 ancient woodlands \u2013 with 80% of \u201caffected\u201d woodlands left intact as the new line arrows through them. There will be generous compensation, it claims. But can ancient woods be replaced? And what do the people living beside these imperilled old woods think? South Cubbington wood in Warwickshire, on a hill above the scenic River Leam, has been fenced off in preparation for the chainsawing of old oaks and wild service trees. A deep cutting wider than a motorway will be carved through it. Beside the wood, a 250-year-old pear tree is surrounded by plastic fencing and awaiting execution. It was crowned England\u2019s \u201ctree of the year\u201d in 2015. Now, dumper trucks thunder past. \u201cIt breaks my heart seeing all this,\u201d says one local resident, Elaine Barker. \u201cThe wildlife won\u2019t have the freedom to go from wood to meadow to river because they\u2019ll have a great big concrete line in front of them. And neither will we. We live in Leamington Spa, one of the most polluted towns in Britain, and I have asthmatic children. These woods are a sanctuary.\u201d South Cubbington is cherished by local people, who tramp its tracks with their dogs, and admire carpets of anemones and bluebells in spring. Breathe the air, says a group of Cubbington residents when we enter the woods: it smells cool, damp, mushroomy. Just 2% of Britain is ancient woodland (older than 400 years, in England and Wales). It often features old trees, dead wood (a habitat for rare beetles) and flora such as native bluebells. But the key, say ecologists, is its soils \u2013 even where ancient woodland has been replanted with newer trees, its soil is still undisturbed, chemical-free and rich in fungi, micro-organisms and the seeds of future life. In recent months, despite a continuing review by the retired engineer Douglas Oakervee, HS2 has become increasingly visible to those living near the London-Birmingham route. Roads and footpaths are abruptly closed; rolling countryside is studded with the orange and yellow of diggers, and fences spring up. Construction tracks are laid down; hedgerows are grubbed up. And people have woken up. A week ago, protesters evaded security around South Cubbington to begin a peaceful protest camp. Barker is heartened. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely lovely to see the whole community coming together and saying: \u2018We don\u2019t want this.\u2019\u201d HS2 Ltd\u2019s plans to minimise woodland destruction appear impressive. It is planting 7m trees and shrubs, creating 3,300 hectares of wildlife habitat \u2013 a third greater than there is today. Ecologists say one crucial part of ancient woodland is its (untouched, chemical-free) soil, and so in South Cubbington the forest floor will be dug up and dumped on to new sites. Ironically, the wood\u2019s imminent destruction is because winter is the most wildlife-friendly time to relocate its soil. But ancient woodland, says Luci Ryan, of the Woodland Trust, is irreplaceable. Every developer threatening ancient woodland (there are 995 examples of development on or beside ancient woodland) claims theirs is just a small slice; a finite resource continues to be eroded. Although the Woodland Trust says no new planting can offset the destruction of such forests, it wants a planting/loss ratio of 30:1. HS2 Ltd has not listed the precise compensation planting for each ancient woodland lost. \u201cIf we\u2019re being really generous,\u201d says Ryan, \u201cthe planting ratio is about six hectares to every one lost\u201d for phase one of the project (London to Birmingham). \u201cPeople say: \u2018It\u2019s just trees, and people are losing homes and businesses,\u2019 but the problem is the way it was designed \u2013 if HS2 Ltd had considered the ancient woods in the beginning we wouldn\u2019t be seen as unreasonable.\u201d The fragmentation caused by the line slicing through ancient woods is highlighted by Mike Pollard of Banbury Ornithological Society, which owns Glyn Davies wood in Northamptonshire. \u201cWe don\u2019t have much ancient woodland in this area; only little pockets of it survive,\u201d he says as he shows me its 300-year-old oaks and the skeletons of last spring\u2019s bluebells (another sign of ancient woodland). \u201cThere\u2019s all this deadwood, old trees, two species of elm; it\u2019s a really good sample of ancient woodland.\u201d Everyone knows ancient trees can\u2019t move, but even mobile bird species will be affected, Pollard says.

      "bodyText": "Ian McKellen: The Biography Garry O\u2019Connor W&amp;N, \u00a320, pp368 Sir Ian McKellen got cold feet about writing his memoirs, in the end returning a substantial advance to his publisher. In its stead his old friend Garry O\u2019Connor has produced a fascinating account of the actor\u2019s life and career \u2013 his passions, his craft, his gay rights activism, not to mention his generosity (\u201cGandalf pays\u201d\u2019 is his habitual cry at the end of a meal). The occasional questionable value judgment on his work aside, this is surely the definitive McKellen biography. The Jewel Neil Hegarty Head of Zeus, \u00a37.99, pp320 With his second novel (following the excellent Inch Levels) the Irish author Neil Hegarty proves again that he is one to watch. After an atmospheric prologue dealing with the making of a Victorian painting, The Jewel, the narrative moves to the present day where we are given detailed perspectives on the curation, theft and recovery of the picture. Hegarty writes with sharp intelligence, which coupled with his strong storytelling and well-defined characters, results in a gripping plot that also offers an affecting insight into how artifice permeates our lives. Five Days of Fog Anna Freeman W&amp;N, \u00a38.99, pp368 The quote on the dustjacket (\u201cIt\u2019s Peaky Blinders with a feminist twist!\u201d) sells Anna Freeman\u2019s intelligent and stylish novel short. Like Dominick Donald\u2019s Breathe, it\u2019s a crime story set in the great smog of London in 1952, but while Donald used the fog as a metaphor for the crimes of John Christie, Freeman focuses on a gang of female thieves, led by Florrie, who is beginning to have doubts about her purpose and vocation. The author has an ear for snappy argot, whether it\u2019s a sharp one-liner or slangy insult, making for a promising debut. \u2022 To order Ian McKellen: The Biography or Five Days of Fog go to guardianbookshop.com or call 0330 333 6846.

Cream is now seen as the first \u201csupergroup\u201d, comprising outstanding musicians each of whom was blazing a trail on his respective instrument. Baker brought a freewheeling energy to his drumming, prompting comparisons to the jazz drummer <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQt2QMtDDiI\" title=\"\">Art Blakey</a>. He was not abnormally fast or flashy, but he was innovative, using twin bass drums and displaying a flair for African-influenced beats, to which he had been introduced by the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZR4ZfCh601k\" title=\"\">British jazz drummer Phil Seamen</a>. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN0ZgGa1ejY\" title=\"\">Baker often claimed he never practised</a>, but relied on spontaneous inspiration when playing with other musicians. Cream\u2019s stage shows often featured improvisations lasting 20 minutes or more, and the group\u2019s 1968 double album Wheels of Fire included a 16-minute version of the Willie Dixon song Spoonful, and 16 more minutes of Baker\u2019s drumming showcase Toad.</p> <p>The idea of using the drumkit as a solo instrument was an innovation ascribed to Cream, though one that listeners would find a mixed blessing in years to come. The band was undeniably adept, however, at creating unusual but commercially potent singles. Hits such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9BwfcrN9hw\" title=\"\">I Feel Free (1966)</a>, White Room (1968), <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16h6vLy6n4A\" title=\"\">Sunshine of Your Love</a> (1968), Tales of Brave Ulysses (1967) and Badge (1969) are some of the most atmospheric, rhythmic and distinctive compositions of their era.</p> <p>In 1962 Baker, then a jobbing drummer in London\u2019s jazz clubs, had been recommended by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/feb/27/charlie-watts-it-wouldnt-bother-me-if-rolling-stones-split\" title=\"\">Charlie Watts</a>, the future Rolling Stones drummer, for a job with Alexis Korner\u2019s Blues Incorporated, where he first encountered Bruce. Along with Graham Bond and the saxophonist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/dec/22/guardianobituaries.arts\" title=\"\">Dick Heckstall-Smith</a>, the pair formed the <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Graham+Bond+Organisation\" title=\"\">Graham Bond Organisation</a>, playing a form of jazzy rhythm and blues that won them a devoted following. However, they also developed a hostility that eventually led to Baker firing Bruce from the band.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3035411d631fc21e9acea44e87921eff1aa31b7d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3035411d631fc21e9acea44e87921eff1aa31b7d/0_157_5083_3050/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cream performing in 1966.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cream performing in 1966.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ron Howard/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Baker then approached Clapton, the rising star of British blues, with a view to forming a new group. Clapton was enthusiastic, but insisted on bringing in Bruce on bass. Despite misgivings, Baker agreed. Cream\u2019s debut single, Wrapping Paper (1966), was uncharacteristic light jazzy pop, but their debut album, Fresh Cream, released that December, found the group already hitting its distinctive stride in powerful tracks such as NSU, I\u2019m So Glad and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPKQJQWQhKo\" title=\"\">Spoonful</a>. It reached No 6 on the UK album chart.</p> <p>The band released two further albums during its lifetime. Disraeli Gears (1967) was a formidable demonstration of their instrumental and compositional skills, while the live half of Wheels of Fire \u2013 a US chart-topper \u2013 illustrated the self-indulgence they were capable of in concert. The group split up in November 1968, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimclash/2016/01/21/famous-rock-feuds-jack-bruce-on-ginger-baker-and-ginger-literally-on-jack/#4f537600a147\" title=\"\">at least partly because of the violent antagonism between Baker and Bruce</a>, and a fourth album, Goodbye, appeared in February 1969. Despite being a short and scrappy collection of live and studio tracks, it gave them a UK No 1, and their four albums sold 15m copies between them.</p> <p>Following Cream\u2019s demise, Baker joined a new \u201csupergroup\u201d, Blind Faith, with Clapton, Steve Winwood (from Traffic) and bassist Ric Grech (from Family). Despite the huge success of Blind Faith\u2019s eponymous 1969 album, which topped both the US and British charts and sold half a million copies within a month of release, the band disintegrated that October, after completing a US tour. Baker was bitterly disappointed to find that Clapton was jumping ship (he departed to form Derek and the Dominoes) and decided he would form a band of his own.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bfb3be78c8bd4f238ad612b1d3523ef9b5e77c7e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bfb3be78c8bd4f238ad612b1d3523ef9b5e77c7e/0_309_2080_1248/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jack Bruce, Ginger Baker and Eric Clapton of Cream during their farewell performance at the Royal Albert Hall, London, 1968.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jack Bruce, Ginger Baker and Eric Clapton of Cream during their farewell performance at the Royal Albert Hall, London, 1968.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Susie Macdonald/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He brought Winwood and Grech into a new jazz-rock fusion project, Ginger Baker\u2019s Air Force. The 11-piece lineup included drummers Seamen and Remi Kabaka, Bond on Hammond organ and saxophone, Denny Laine on guitar and a trio of brass players. The music was an exuberant and improvisational blend of blues, R&amp;B, jazz and African music. Baker was always bitter that Bruce and the lyricist <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/pete-brown-feels-cream-244014/\" title=\"\">Pete Brown</a> (the unofficial \u201cfourth member\u201d of Cream) had claimed most of the songwriting royalties from Cream, and so with Air Force and most of his future projects he figured prominently in the writing credits.</p> <p>Winwood and Grech stayed long enough to appear on the group\u2019s first album, a double LP live recording of a concert at the Royal Albert Hall in January 1970, before departing to join a reunited Traffic. Without Winwood or Clapton, however, Baker could not pull the crowds.</p> <p>When the now nine-piece Air Force embarked on a US tour, it was met by miserable ticket sales and a lack of interest at radio stations. A second album, Ginger Baker\u2019s Air Force 2, was released in December 1970, but it failed to recapture the spontaneous magic of its predecessor, and both album and band slid into obscurity. </p> <p>After a near-fatal cocaine overdose that September, Baker realised he needed a complete break and, travelling by Land Rover, went to Lagos, Nigeria, where he opened a 16-track recording studio, Batakota (ARC) studios, and became close friends with local \u2013 later global \u2013 superstar <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/fela-kuti\" title=\"\">Fela Kuti</a>. Baker fully immersed himself in the rhythms of African music, and also joined the <a href=\"http://lagospolo.com/\" title=\"\">Lagos Polo Club</a>. He retained his enthusiasm for horses and polo for the rest of his life.</p> <p>During his spell in Lagos, Baker featured on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yrqYiFhcWY\" title=\"\">Kuti\u2019s 1971 album Live!</a>, while Kuti appeared on Baker\u2019s Stratavarious (1972). In 1973 Paul McCartney and Wings recorded Picasso\u2019s Last Words (Drink to Me), from Band on the Run, at ARC, on which Baker shook a tin of gravel as percussion, though he was disgruntled that McCartney recorded the rest of his album at EMI\u2019s Lagos studios.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab67442482438ce12d2b4d6531871e02bf16e776\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab67442482438ce12d2b4d6531871e02bf16e776/0_232_6089_3653/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ginger Baker performing with Baker Gurvitz Army, 1975.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ginger Baker performing with Baker Gurvitz Army, 1975.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colin Fuller/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1974 Baker formed the hard rock band Baker Gurvitz Army back in London, with brothers Adrian and Paul Gurvitz (on the guitar and the bass respectively), but after three albums \u2013 the last two of which failed to chart \u2013 in two years, the group fizzled out.</p> <p>Finding himself penniless and reduced to selling drugs, Baker left his wife, Liz (nee Finch), whom he had married in 1959, and their three children, and headed for Tuscany with his girlfriend, Sarah, to try to survive as an olive farmer (the pair married in 1983, but divorced the following year).</p> <p>He was rescued by the record producer <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Laswell\" title=\"\">Bill Laswell</a>, who tracked Baker down and took him to New York to play on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7RGMndpadw\" title=\"\">Album (1986)</a>, the fifth studio album by John Lydon\u2019s Public Image Ltd (PiL). \u201cThe farm was a disaster,\u201d Laswell commented of Baker\u2019s Tuscan retreat. \u201cThere was no electricity, and he had this tiny bed he would sleep in with his dogs. It\u2019s a miracle that he was still alive.\u201d</p> <p>Born in Lewisham, south-east London, Peter Baker \u2013 his red hair earned him the unoriginal nickname of \u201cGinger\u201d \u2013 was the son of Ruby Streatfield, who worked in a tobacconist\u2019s, and Frederick Baker, a brick-layer who was killed while serving with the Royal Corps of Signals in 1943. The young Ginger was aimless and unmotivated until he discovered a passion for competitive cycling.</p> <p>This ended abruptly after his bike was wrecked in a collision with a London taxi. Then he experimented with playing drums belonging to a friend from Shooter\u2019s Hill grammar school, which inspired him to buy his own set for \u00a33. \u201cI thought, good God, at last there\u2019s something I can do,\u201d he recalled.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O5IgyDcohQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8O5IgyDcohQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Cream performing Sunshine of Your Love</figcaption> </figure>   <p>He began playing music part-time while working as a signwriter and then with an advertising agency, but after earning \u00a312 for a week\u2019s work with the <a href=\"https://www.discogs.com/artist/990817-Storyville-Jazz-Band\" title=\"\">Stor</a><a href=\"https://www.discogs.com/artist/990817-Storyville-Jazz-Band\" title=\"\">yville Jazz Band</a> he decided to turn professional. By the end of the decade he had played with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/mar/19/terry-lightfoot\" title=\"\">Terry Lightfoot</a>\u2019s New Orleans Jazzmen and bands run by the jazz clarinettist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/nov/03/acker-bilk\" title=\"\">Acker Bilk</a> and the jazz guitarist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/apr/15/diz-disley-obituary\" title=\"\">Diz Disley</a>. However, the opinionated, combative Baker found himself frustrated by both his bandmates and the music\u2019s stylistic limitations. An unfortunate side-effect of his stints in London jazz clubs was a heroin habit that would dog him into the 80s.</p> <p>Baker weaned himself off the drug in that decade and, following, his work with PiL, continued to collaborate with Laswell, with his own album Horses &amp; Trees (1986), an eclectic set featuring the violinist L Shankar and percussionist A\u00efyb Dieng, and Middle Passage (1990), a mix of Afrobeat, rock and jazz-fusion.</p> <p>In 1988 Baker had moved to Los Angeles, where he met and married his third wife, Karen Loucks. In 1993 he moved to a ranch in Colorado to raise polo ponies. Also that year he recorded Sunrise on the Sufferbus with the hard rock band Masters of Reality, an album that produced the hit single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beyj3BE7RPY\" title=\"\">She Got Me (When She Got Her Dress On)</a>.</p> <p>He managed to fit in stints with the Ginger Baker Trio, with the guitarist Bill Frisell and the bassist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jul/13/charlie-haden\" title=\"\">Charlie Haden</a>, and even briefly reunited with Bruce alongside the guitarist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/feb/07/gary-moore-obituary\" title=\"\">Gary Moore</a> in BBM. However, in the late 90s, problems with the tax and immigration authorities forced him to leave the US for good.</p> <p>He bought a farm in KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa, but upset the local all-white polo club by importing a team of black Nigerian players. Again forced to move, he resettled in Tulbagh in the Western Cape. In 2010, he was married for the fourth time, to a Zimbabwean woman, Kudzai Machokoto.</p> <p>In 2005, Cream reunited for a series of concerts at the Royal Albert Hall and New York\u2019s Madison Square Garden, preserved on the album <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Albert_Hall_London_May_2-3-5-6,_2005\" title=\"\">Royal Albert Hall London May 2-3-5-6</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Albert_Hall_London_May_2-3-5-6,_2005\" title=\"\"> 2005</a>.

Hits such as I Feel Free (1966), White Room (1968), Sunshine of Your Love (1968), Tales of Brave Ulysses (1967) and Badge (1969) are some of the most atmospheric, rhythmic and distinctive compositions of their era. In 1962 Baker, then a jobbing drummer in London\u2019s jazz clubs, had been recommended by Charlie Watts, the future Rolling Stones drummer, for a job with Alexis Korner\u2019s Blues Incorporated, where he first encountered Bruce. Along with Graham Bond and the saxophonist Dick Heckstall-Smith, the pair formed the Graham Bond Organisation, playing a form of jazzy rhythm and blues that won them a devoted following.

It reached No 6 on the UK album chart. The band released two further albums during its lifetime. Disraeli Gears (1967) was a formidable demonstration of their instrumental and compositional skills, while the live half of Wheels of Fire \u2013 a US chart-topper \u2013 illustrated the self-indulgence they were capable of in concert. The group split up in November 1968, at least partly because of the violent antagonism between Baker and Bruce, and a fourth album, Goodbye, appeared in February 1969. Despite being a short and scrappy collection of live and studio tracks, it gave them a UK No 1, and their four albums sold 15m copies between them.

Baker was always bitter that Bruce and the lyricist Pete Brown (the unofficial \u201cfourth member\u201d of Cream) had claimed most of the songwriting royalties from Cream, and so with Air Force and most of his future projects he figured prominently in the writing credits. Winwood and Grech stayed long enough to appear on the group\u2019s first album, a double LP live recording of a concert at the Royal Albert Hall in January 1970, before departing to join a reunited Traffic. Without Winwood or Clapton, however, Baker could not pull the crowds. When the now nine-piece Air Force embarked on a US tour, it was met by miserable ticket sales and a lack of interest at radio stations. A second album, Ginger Baker\u2019s Air Force 2, was released in December 1970, but it failed to recapture the spontaneous magic of its predecessor, and both album and band slid into obscurity. After a near-fatal cocaine overdose that September, Baker realised he needed a complete break and, travelling by Land Rover, went to Lagos, Nigeria, where he opened a 16-track recording studio, Batakota (ARC) studios, and became close friends with local \u2013 later global \u2013 superstar Fela Kuti. Baker fully immersed himself in the rhythms of African music, and also joined the Lagos Polo Club. He retained his enthusiasm for horses and polo for the rest of his life. During his spell in Lagos, Baker featured on Kuti\u2019s 1971 album Live!, while Kuti appeared on Baker\u2019s Stratavarious (1972). In 1973 Paul McCartney and Wings recorded Picasso\u2019s Last Words (Drink to Me), from Band on the Run, at ARC, on which Baker shook a tin of gravel as percussion, though he was disgruntled that McCartney recorded the rest of his album at EMI\u2019s Lagos studios. In 1974 Baker formed the hard rock band Baker Gurvitz Army back in London, with brothers Adrian and Paul Gurvitz (on the guitar and the bass respectively), but after three albums \u2013 the last two of which failed to chart \u2013 in two years, the group fizzled out. Finding himself penniless and reduced to selling drugs, Baker left his wife, Liz (nee Finch), whom he had married in 1959, and their three children, and headed for Tuscany with his girlfriend, Sarah, to try to survive as an olive farmer (the pair married in 1983, but divorced the following year). He was rescued by the record producer Bill Laswell, who tracked Baker down and took him to New York to play on Album (1986), the fifth studio album by John Lydon\u2019s Public Image Ltd (PiL). \u201cThe farm was a disaster,\u201d Laswell commented of Baker\u2019s Tuscan retreat. \u201cThere was no electricity, and he had this tiny bed he would sleep in with his dogs. It\u2019s a miracle that he was still alive.\u201d Born in Lewisham, south-east London, Peter Baker \u2013 his red hair earned him the unoriginal nickname of \u201cGinger\u201d \u2013 was the son of Ruby Streatfield, who worked in a tobacconist\u2019s, and Frederick Baker, a brick-layer who was killed while serving with the Royal Corps of Signals in 1943. The young Ginger was aimless and unmotivated until he discovered a passion for competitive cycling. This ended abruptly after his bike was wrecked in a collision with a London taxi. Then he experimented with playing drums belonging to a friend from Shooter\u2019s Hill grammar school, which inspired him to buy his own set for \u00a33. \u201cI thought, good God, at last there\u2019s something I can do,\u201d he recalled. He began playing music part-time while working as a signwriter and then with an advertising agency, but after earning \u00a312 for a week\u2019s work with the Storyville Jazz Band he decided to turn professional. By the end of the decade he had played with Terry Lightfoot\u2019s New Orleans Jazzmen and bands run by the jazz clarinettist Acker Bilk and the jazz guitarist Diz Disley. However, the opinionated, combative Baker found himself frustrated by both his bandmates and the music\u2019s stylistic limitations. An unfortunate side-effect of his stints in London jazz clubs was a heroin habit that would dog him into the 80s. Baker weaned himself off the drug in that decade and, following, his work with PiL, continued to collaborate with Laswell, with his own album Horses &amp; Trees (1986), an eclectic set featuring the violinist L Shankar and percussionist A\u00efyb Dieng, and Middle Passage (1990), a mix of Afrobeat, rock and jazz-fusion. In 1988 Baker had moved to Los Angeles, where he met and married his third wife, Karen Loucks. In 1993 he moved to a ranch in Colorado to raise polo ponies. Also that year he recorded Sunrise on the Sufferbus with the hard rock band Masters of Reality, an album that produced the hit single She Got Me (When She Got Her Dress On). He managed to fit in stints with the Ginger Baker Trio, with the guitarist Bill Frisell and the bassist Charlie Haden, and even briefly reunited with Bruce alongside the guitarist Gary Moore in BBM. However, in the late 90s, problems with the tax and immigration authorities forced him to leave the US for good. He bought a farm in KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa, but upset the local all-white polo club by importing a team of black Nigerian players. Again forced to move, he resettled in Tulbagh in the Western Cape. In 2010, he was married for the fourth time, to a Zimbabwean woman, Kudzai Machokoto. In 2005, Cream reunited for a series of concerts at the Royal Albert Hall and New York\u2019s Madison Square Garden, preserved on the album Royal Albert Hall London May 2-3-5-6 2005. In 2009 Baker published Hellraiser: The Autobiography of the World\u2019s Greatest Drummer, co-written with his daughter Nettie. Jay Bulger\u2019s documentary Beware of Mr Baker premiered at the SXSW festival in 2012, and its raw portrayal of Baker\u2019s extraordinary life won it the grand jury award for best documentary feature. The same year, an impoverished Baker had to sell up and leave South Africa. He returned to London and formed a new quartet, Jazz Confusion, which in 2014 released Why? Baker, who had been suffering from degenerative osteoarthritis and a smoking-related pulmonary condition, is survived by Kudzai, his children, Nettie, Leda and Kofi, and a stepdaughter, Lisa. \u2022 Peter Edward \u201cGinger\u201d Baker, drummer, born 19 August 1939; died 6 October 2019",

It will probably be nasty, brutish and, with the phone hacking case not coming to trial for a year at least, not particularly short. Wherever your sympathies lie, there are also unlikely to be any winners.</p> <p>Part of the problem is that proper debate on a case-by-case basis no longer seems possible.

Respect for family life is at the heart of article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Its first line reads, \u201cEveryone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.\u201d A handwritten note to your estranged father seems to tick \u201cprivate\u201d, \u201cfamily\u201d and \u201ccorrespondence\u201d all at once.</p> <p>Mail lawyers are likely to argue that, as the letter was first mentioned in a People magazine article sympathetic to Meghan, her father had the right to reply. This would surely have justified an interview, but not so many extracts and discussion of her letter.</p> <p>On the issue of copyright, which everyone accepts Meghan owns, there is no public interest defence at all.

But it is possible to be \u201cTeam Meghan\u201d and still think it acceptable to question the cost to taxpayers of royals renovating their home, or taking four private jets in 11 days. This is not the press protecting their own, even those who behave badly, but an essential defence of what journalism is \u2013 holding the powerful to account.

      "bodyText": "A paranoid and exhausted Mike Pence (Beck Bennett) opened this week\u2019s Saturday Night Live in full crisis control mode over the latest developments in the Trump-Ukraine impeachment inquiry scandal. Rather than \u201cseeing the new Judy Garland movie with mother\u201d, as he should be doing, he finds himself strategizing with fellow embattled Trump cronies Rudy Giuliani (Kate McKinnon), attorney general William Barr (Aidy Bryant), and secretary of state Mike Pompeo (Matthew Broderick), the latter of whom is supposed to be testifying before Congress, but who pulled a Ferris Bueller and ditched it. Giuliani suggests closing ranks, while Pompeo floats fleeing to friendlier shores: \u201cThere\u2019s a whole list of countries that would love to have us. North Korea \u2026 Saudi Arabia \u2026 end of list.\u201d After a couple quick appearances from the likes of Ben Carson, Stephen Miller (a literal serpent), and the confused president of Finland, things wrap up with another lazy Ferris Bueller callback and a pointless Joker reference.

      "body": "<p>It is the heels I see first \u2013 towering, spiky, perhaps not ideal driving footwear \u2013 as Shirley Ballas gets out of her shiny red Porsche. I have been waiting on the doorstep of her house, feeling a little scruffy. This is compounded when we get inside: it is the most spotless home I have ever seen. It almost feels a little unreal, like a film set, as if I have stepped into a Ballas biopic (and someone should do one) where our heroine is sitting, looking perfect in tight denim, having very definitely made it.</p> <p>Ballas came to widespread public attention in 2017, at the age of 56, when she was made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/may/09/queen-of-latin-shirley-ballas-replace-len-goodman-strictly-come-dancing-head-judge\" title=\"\">head judge of the TV dance competition Strictly Come Dancing</a>. Now it seems the inevitable crowning achievement in an unstoppable career propelled by grit and talent, although she says it was \u201ca total shock\u201d.</p> <p>The 17th series of Strictly has just started \u2013 it is Ballas\u2019s third \u2013 and there is no sign that it is losing its sheen. It is a \u201cmagical\u201d show, she says. \u201cI think it\u2019s got everything \u2013 it\u2019s funny, it\u2019s got glitz and glamour. You watch these people go through this emotional journey every single week and what you see is real. It\u2019s not staged.\u201d</p> <p>Her appointment seemed to repair some of the damage done in 2009 when a former judge, the vastly experienced Arlene Phillips, was replaced by the much younger Alesha Dixon, a former contestant, and <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">the show was accused of ageism</a>. Ballas is pleased if her appointment showed the power of older women. \u201cPeople seem to think that, by the time you hit 45 or 50, you might as well just pack it in and call it a day,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like that in my own industry [dance] as well \u2013 it\u2019s run by men and an older woman just doesn\u2019t seem to have a part in anything. So, I think it flew the flag for everybody. Don\u2019t give up hope if you feel like you belong somewhere, or you can do it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea203eb6bfbd61c231c9a0c11d5e8da42cee3e66\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea203eb6bfbd61c231c9a0c11d5e8da42cee3e66/0_0_4285_2858/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shirley Ballas with her fellow Strictly judges Craig Revel Horwood, Motsi Mabuse and Bruno Tonioli\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I think Strictly has everything \u2013 it\u2019s funny, it\u2019s got glitz and glamour\u2019 ... with her fellow judges, Craig Revel Horwood, Motsi Mabuse and Bruno Tonioli.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kieron McCarron/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I tell her that I love that one of the biggest shows on TV is female-led \u2013 it is presented by Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman, while the production team is run by women. \u201cWell, I think they lead it better than men,\u201d says Ballas with a smile.</p> <p>We talk about how the quality of the dancing this series seems so high \u2013 \u201cSending somebody home each week is not going to be easy,\u201d she says \u2013 and about whether it is fair to pit people who have never danced before against former pop stars: \u201cIf everybody was the same level, could you imagine how boring it would be?\u201d She says she was \u201cvery sad\u201d when the former ballerina <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/gallery/2019/apr/27/darcey-bussell-ballerina-50-strictly-come-dancing-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Darcey Bussell</a> decided not to return as a judge, but that she was \u201cabsolutely thrilled\u201d when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jul/22/motsi-mabuse-to-join-strictly-come-dancing-judging-panel\" title=\"\">Motsi Mabuse</a>, whom she has known for 20 years, got the job. \u201cWe have the same sense of humour, we\u2019re on the same page, she\u2019s from the same industry.\u201d She used to judge Mabuse in competitions. \u201cShe was just like this bottle of champagne \u2013 full of bubbles and sparkle when she danced.\u201d</p> <p>I mention the so-called Strictly curse, whereby some celebrities end up leaving their marriages for their dance partners. I have always wondered whether the producers are dismayed at such scandal rocking a family show, or pleased that it makes it more talked-about. \u201cThat question I couldn\u2019t answer; that\u2019s above my pay grade,\u201d she says. Is it inevitable that people fall in love when they dance together? \u201cYou mean to tell me in your office that\u2019s never happened? But ours happens to be on TV, on one of the biggest TV shows, and so it\u2019s just magnified. If you go into any industry, it happens all the time and it\u2019s not a big deal. But it seems to be when it happens on Strictly.\u201d Does everyone gossip about it behind the scenes? She smiles, hard as a diamond. \u201cI am there to judge a dance competition: I\u2019m there to judge your footwork, your rhythm, how you look and how you are. I am not there to judge your private life.\u201d</p> <p>By the time Ballas was 25, she had been engaged to three of her dance partners and married to two. \u201cMy mother collects engagement rings,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cI remember my teacher telling me at 17: \u2018Everybody [in dance] gets married, Shirley.\u2019 And I said: \u2018But we hardly know each other.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7a194f9b187dc6a867d27888629dcc8e8070405c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a194f9b187dc6a867d27888629dcc8e8070405c/0_0_3024_4032/750.jpg\" alt=\"Shirley Ballas in 1975\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I\u2019m competitive with myself all the time\u2019 ... Ballas in 1975.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HANDOUT</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ballas grew up in Merseyside, raised by her single mother, Audrey; her father left when she was two \u2013 \u201cNot a penny was given ... not even a pair of shoes\u201d \u2013 along with her older brother, David. Audrey, to whom Ballas is extremely close, took every job she could. She worked in a chocolate factory and went for a job as a forklift-truck driver there because it paid more. Audrey must have been the only woman, all 5ft of her, driving one of their forklifts in the 60s. It probably goes some way to explaining her daughter\u2019s determination.</p> <p>When Ballas was seven, she went to Brownies one night and noticed an adult ballroom-dancing class next door. She remembers standing on tiptoes to look through the window. \u201cI went in and asked the man: \u2018Do you do this for children?\u2019 He said: \u2018We\u2019re starting on Saturday.\u2019\u201d Ballas was hooked instantly. \u201cIt\u2019s the love of music \u2013 the minute it goes, I can\u2019t keep my feet still. I just feel like I need to keep moving and I just love everything about it. I think dancing was a way of showing your femininity and, through the years, your strength, because it\u2019s a male-dominated industry ... to still be standing in my industry today is huge, with the amount of people who\u2019ve tried to stop me getting where I\u2019m going.\u201d</p> <p>She started competing when she was 10. When she was 14, she moved to Yorkshire so she could be paired up with the young British ballroom champion, Nigel Tiffany. It wasn\u2019t difficult to leave home, she says: by now it was her dream to become a professional dancer. \u201cI just knew that we didn\u2019t have the resources,\u201d she says. They didn\u2019t have a car, or spare money, so ferrying her around the country to training sessions and competitions wasn\u2019t an option. \u201cMy mum said I was a very logical thinker.\u201d</p> <p>At 16, Ballas and Tiffany moved to London and got engaged, but Ballas\u2019s dance teacher advised her to have a try-out with another dancer, Sammy Stopford. Tiffany broke off their engagement. (He is now her financial adviser and one of her dearest friends. Stopford \u2013 whom she left for her second husband a few years later \u2013 lives on her road.)</p> <p>She and Stopford won lots of major titles, but then she met Corky Ballas, while she and Stopford were teaching in the US. Corky was handsome and charismatic \u2013 and her head was turned. Their son Mark, born when she was 25, was a \u201cpleasant surprise\u201d, but at that time, she says, most professional dancers didn\u2019t have children \u2013 or, if they did, their careers ended. \u201cI said to my mum: \u2018There\u2019s just no way I\u2019m going to be able to do this.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Her mother stepped in, looking after Mark while Ballas and Corky travelled the world to compete, although often she would take him with them. \u201cIt was very, very difficult,\u201d she says. \u201cBut you\u2019re young, you\u2019re striving for your own career. My mum was there, she took care of him.\u201d It helped, she says, that Mark \u201ccame out of the womb dancing. If the fridge light went on, he thought he was on stage. He loved to dress up. He got our industry.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If I could go back to my younger self, I would say: \u2018You\u2019re fine as you are\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Ballases won the International Latin American Dance championship when she was 35; she had won it with Stopford for the first time at 23. She retired from competition soon after. Was it hard to walk away? \u201cNo. At 36 \u2013 and Mark was 11 \u2013 it was enough.\u201d She had always taught and given demonstrations to earn a living, so she threw herself into this. They also took in the two children \u2013 Derek and Julianne Hough \u2013 of family friends (they are now renowned dancers in the US). Mark was showing signs of becoming a professional dancer, too.</p> <p>When she refers to her children, she means Mark and the Hough siblings, but also her niece, Mary, whom she helped raise after the suicide of her brother in 2003, at the age of 44 (Mary lost her mother not long afterwards). What was the effect of David\u2019s death on the family? \u201cI don\u2019t think my mother will ever get over it,\u201d she says quietly. \u201cNeither of us. He was very much the protector of the family. He was always the one who stood fast behind me, and then suddenly he wasn\u2019t there.\u201d She blamed herself, she says. They knew David was depressed, but not what it meant. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know anything about mental health,\u201d she says. \u201cThere just wasn\u2019t access. There was nothing on TV, there was nothing to read.\u201d Ballas had persuaded their mother to visit her in London, leaving David alone; they had no idea he was feeling suicidal. \u201cI\u2019ll live with that for ever.\u201d Tears spring in her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m going to get upset, sorry.\u201d What she can do now, she says, her voice trembling, \u201cis campaign for the good of men\u2019s mental health\u201d.</p> <p>It hadn\u2019t been long since she and Corky had broken up. Growing up without a father meant \u201cthere was no gauge, really \u2013 what you\u2019re looking for when you get married, how should a man treat you? I didn\u2019t have any scale. So, you know, if you were badly treated, to me it was acceptable, when in actual fact, what I\u2019m realising now, is that it wasn\u2019t.\u201d Was she badly treated? \u201cI won\u2019t go into that part,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"824737460cc8b5309377610e3e1a239ff4ed6b45\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/824737460cc8b5309377610e3e1a239ff4ed6b45/0_0_2412_3648/661.jpg\" alt=\"Shirley Ballas with Bruno Tonioli on Strictly in 2017\" width=\"661\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It\u2019s the love of music \u2013 the minute it goes, I can\u2019t keep my feet still\u2019 ... with Tonioli on Strictly in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Fisher/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She met her current partner, the actor Danny Taylor, when they were doing panto last Christmas. \u201cI never, ever thought in my lifetime I would meet a man who, with the exception of my brother \u2026\u201d She doesn\u2019t finish the sentence. \u201cHe\u2019s just a really, really good man. He\u2019s definitely restored some confidence in me that perhaps I had when David was alive, but I haven\u2019t had since.\u201d</p> <p>She doesn\u2019t strike me as someone with low confidence. \u201cLower than you would imagine,\u201d she says. \u201cAll the time. Even on Strictly, I can\u2019t deal with somebody telling me I look lovely. It\u2019s a personal thing for me.\u201d Being a dancer must give you an unusual amount of awareness about the way you look. \u201cOf course,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you\u2019re serious about your trade, you\u2019ve got to take care of yourself. You\u2019ve got those flimsy Latin dresses on, you know you\u2019re flashing your panties, you have to be in a good shape. But it comes at a price.\u201d</p> <p>Ballas doesn\u2019t lack confidence in her abilities as a judge and a teacher \u2013 she says it is her \u201csafe place, because I know my job inside and out. All my confidence I have is in my trade, and I think my own personal issues are my own personal issues, from different marriages and from different things throughout my life.\u201d</p> <p>Later this month, Ballas will have her breast implants removed, having become worried that they make mammogram screening more difficult. Her mother and aunt were both recently diagnosed with cancer, although not breast cancer. She had them in the first place, she says, because of a lack of confidence. \u201cIf I could go back to my younger self, I would say: \u2018You\u2019re fine as you are, and God makes people in different ways; we\u2019re all different shapes and sizes.\u2019 But I think when you have people telling you different things about yourself, it\u2019s like: chip, chip, chip, and you don\u2019t believe anything you\u2019ve got is nice or pretty. I think I got implants more because I was searching to find something that was beautiful, when perhaps I didn\u2019t realise, as Danny says, it\u2019s inner beauty that counts the most.\u201d</p> <p>What is impressive about Ballas, what counts the most, is what a grafter she seems to be \u2013 that and the way she has given her knowledge and support to countless proteges. At almost 60, with five decades in the business, she should be revered in the dance world. Largely, she is, but she describes an industry rife with bullying and vitriol, at least at the top. Although she is adamant she has no knowledge of anything that could fuel a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/metoo-movement\" title=\"\">#MeToo movement</a> within the industry, she says it is a male-dominated world. \u201cIf you\u2019re doing well as a female and somebody feels threatened, then they make it difficult for you.\u201d One of the reasons she jumped at the Strictly job was \u201cbecause there were men at the top that were trying to push my nose out\u201d. She says she has been prevented from judging competitions, while couples she has trained have been told they would never win competitions if they stayed with her. How has she coped? \u201cYou have to have a steel spine, darling: you won\u2019t last five minutes in this kind of industry if you don\u2019t. And I\u2019m sure that\u2019s the same for any woman in any industry, at the top.\u201d</p> <p>Recently, one of the dancers she trained became a pro on Dancing With the Stars (the US version of Strictly) and he sent her a video of himself. \u201cI was crying, I was so moved,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was his dream, and to see that boy live his dreams is \u2026 it just touches me.\u201d She likes to see people do well, she says. \u201cI haven\u2019t got a green bone in my body. I have not got a jealous streak of any type at all.\u201d But she must be competitive? She smiles. \u201cWell, that\u2019s different,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m competitive with myself all the time \u2013 everything from the way I look to how I do on TV. I\u2019m competitive with myself because I want to be all that I can be.\u201d</p> <p><em>Strictly Come Dancing is on Saturday nights on BBC One</em></p> <p><em>In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or by emailing <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.org\" title=\"\">jo@samaritans.org</a> or <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.ie\" title=\"\">jo@samaritans.ie</a>.

      "bodyText": "It is the heels I see first \u2013 towering, spiky, perhaps not ideal driving footwear \u2013 as Shirley Ballas gets out of her shiny red Porsche. I have been waiting on the doorstep of her house, feeling a little scruffy. This is compounded when we get inside: it is the most spotless home I have ever seen. It almost feels a little unreal, like a film set, as if I have stepped into a Ballas biopic (and someone should do one) where our heroine is sitting, looking perfect in tight denim, having very definitely made it. Ballas came to widespread public attention in 2017, at the age of 56, when she was made head judge of the TV dance competition Strictly Come Dancing. Now it seems the inevitable crowning achievement in an unstoppable career propelled by grit and talent, although she says it was \u201ca total shock\u201d. The 17th series of Strictly has just started \u2013 it is Ballas\u2019s third \u2013 and there is no sign that it is losing its sheen. It is a \u201cmagical\u201d show, she says. \u201cI think it\u2019s got everything \u2013 it\u2019s funny, it\u2019s got glitz and glamour. You watch these people go through this emotional journey every single week and what you see is real. It\u2019s not staged.\u201d Her appointment seemed to repair some of the damage done in 2009 when a former judge, the vastly experienced Arlene Phillips, was replaced by the much younger Alesha Dixon, a former contestant, and the show was accused of ageism. Ballas is pleased if her appointment showed the power of older women. \u201cPeople seem to think that, by the time you hit 45 or 50, you might as well just pack it in and call it a day,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like that in my own industry [dance] as well \u2013 it\u2019s run by men and an older woman just doesn\u2019t seem to have a part in anything. So, I think it flew the flag for everybody. Don\u2019t give up hope if you feel like you belong somewhere, or you can do it.\u201d I tell her that I love that one of the biggest shows on TV is female-led \u2013 it is presented by Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman, while the production team is run by women. \u201cWell, I think they lead it better than men,\u201d says Ballas with a smile. We talk about how the quality of the dancing this series seems so high \u2013 \u201cSending somebody home each week is not going to be easy,\u201d she says \u2013 and about whether it is fair to pit people who have never danced before against former pop stars: \u201cIf everybody was the same level, could you imagine how boring it would be?\u201d She says she was \u201cvery sad\u201d when the former ballerina Darcey Bussell decided not to return as a judge, but that she was \u201cabsolutely thrilled\u201d when Motsi Mabuse, whom she has known for 20 years, got the job. \u201cWe have the same sense of humour, we\u2019re on the same page, she\u2019s from the same industry.\u201d She used to judge Mabuse in competitions. \u201cShe was just like this bottle of champagne \u2013 full of bubbles and sparkle when she danced.\u201d I mention the so-called Strictly curse, whereby some celebrities end up leaving their marriages for their dance partners. I have always wondered whether the producers are dismayed at such scandal rocking a family show, or pleased that it makes it more talked-about. \u201cThat question I couldn\u2019t answer; that\u2019s above my pay grade,\u201d she says. Is it inevitable that people fall in love when they dance together? \u201cYou mean to tell me in your office that\u2019s never happened? But ours happens to be on TV, on one of the biggest TV shows, and so it\u2019s just magnified. If you go into any industry, it happens all the time and it\u2019s not a big deal. But it seems to be when it happens on Strictly.\u201d Does everyone gossip about it behind the scenes? She smiles, hard as a diamond. \u201cI am there to judge a dance competition: I\u2019m there to judge your footwork, your rhythm, how you look and how you are. I am not there to judge your private life.\u201d By the time Ballas was 25, she had been engaged to three of her dance partners and married to two. \u201cMy mother collects engagement rings,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cI remember my teacher telling me at 17: \u2018Everybody [in dance] gets married, Shirley.\u2019 And I said: \u2018But we hardly know each other.\u2019\u201d Ballas grew up in Merseyside, raised by her single mother, Audrey; her father left when she was two \u2013 \u201cNot a penny was given ... not even a pair of shoes\u201d \u2013 along with her older brother, David. Audrey, to whom Ballas is extremely close, took every job she could. She worked in a chocolate factory and went for a job as a forklift-truck driver there because it paid more. Audrey must have been the only woman, all 5ft of her, driving one of their forklifts in the 60s. It probably goes some way to explaining her daughter\u2019s determination. When Ballas was seven, she went to Brownies one night and noticed an adult ballroom-dancing class next door. She remembers standing on tiptoes to look through the window. \u201cI went in and asked the man: \u2018Do you do this for children?\u2019 He said: \u2018We\u2019re starting on Saturday.\u2019\u201d Ballas was hooked instantly. \u201cIt\u2019s the love of music \u2013 the minute it goes, I can\u2019t keep my feet still. I just feel like I need to keep moving and I just love everything about it. I think dancing was a way of showing your femininity and, through the years, your strength, because it\u2019s a male-dominated industry ... to still be standing in my industry today is huge, with the amount of people who\u2019ve tried to stop me getting where I\u2019m going.\u201d She started competing when she was 10. When she was 14, she moved to Yorkshire so she could be paired up with the young British ballroom champion, Nigel Tiffany. It wasn\u2019t difficult to leave home, she says: by now it was her dream to become a professional dancer. \u201cI just knew that we didn\u2019t have the resources,\u201d she says. They didn\u2019t have a car, or spare money, so ferrying her around the country to training sessions and competitions wasn\u2019t an option. \u201cMy mum said I was a very logical thinker.\u201d At 16, Ballas and Tiffany moved to London and got engaged, but Ballas\u2019s dance teacher advised her to have a try-out with another dancer, Sammy Stopford. Tiffany broke off their engagement. (He is now her financial adviser and one of her dearest friends. Stopford \u2013 whom she left for her second husband a few years later \u2013 lives on her road.) She and Stopford won lots of major titles, but then she met Corky Ballas, while she and Stopford were teaching in the US. Corky was handsome and charismatic \u2013 and her head was turned. Their son Mark, born when she was 25, was a \u201cpleasant surprise\u201d, but at that time, she says, most professional dancers didn\u2019t have children \u2013 or, if they did, their careers ended. \u201cI said to my mum: \u2018There\u2019s just no way I\u2019m going to be able to do this.\u2019\u201d Her mother stepped in, looking after Mark while Ballas and Corky travelled the world to compete, although often she would take him with them. \u201cIt was very, very difficult,\u201d she says. \u201cBut you\u2019re young, you\u2019re striving for your own career. My mum was there, she took care of him.\u201d It helped, she says, that Mark \u201ccame out of the womb dancing. If the fridge light went on, he thought he was on stage. He loved to dress up. He got our industry.\u201d The Ballases won the International Latin American Dance championship when she was 35; she had won it with Stopford for the first time at 23. She retired from competition soon after. Was it hard to walk away? \u201cNo. At 36 \u2013 and Mark was 11 \u2013 it was enough.\u201d She had always taught and given demonstrations to earn a living, so she threw herself into this. They also took in the two children \u2013 Derek and Julianne Hough \u2013 of family friends (they are now renowned dancers in the US). Mark was showing signs of becoming a professional dancer, too. When she refers to her children, she means Mark and the Hough siblings, but also her niece, Mary, whom she helped raise after the suicide of her brother in 2003, at the age of 44 (Mary lost her mother not long afterwards). What was the effect of David\u2019s death on the family? \u201cI don\u2019t think my mother will ever get over it,\u201d she says quietly. \u201cNeither of us.

The action is scheduled to get underway sometime after 7.30pm.</p> <p>We should be in for a closely fought contest tonight between two of the standout sides of 2019. They have both beaten the minor premiers Melbourne Storm this finals campaign, the Raiders doing so at AAMI Park three weeks ago to turbocharge their pursuit of the Provan-Summons Trophy. It\u2019s 25 years since they were last on this grandest of stages so the Green Machine are arriving with nothing to lose, and plenty of sentimental support. </p> <p>By contrast the Roosters are old hands at this NRL grand final lark. This is their eighth since the turn of the millennium and as defending champions they\u2019re bidding to go back-to-back for the first time in a generation. </p> <p>It\u2019s second vs fourth from the regular season ladder with the Roosters holding the upper hand. They also won both the head-to-head match-ups this year but by margins of just six and four points. It\u2019s clear who the favourites should be, but grand finals have a habit of upsetting the form book. </p> <p>If you want to drop me a line before the action gets underway you can do so by <a href=\"mailto:jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com\">email</a> or via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jphowcroft?lang=en\">Twitter</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2756fbb2a4ae6afda513f948653c3352c9b3e7a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2756fbb2a4ae6afda513f948653c3352c9b3e7a7/0_0_3844_2563/1000.jpg\" alt=\"NRL grand final\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Canberra Raiders fan Simon Tayoun prepares for the NRL Grand Final between the Canberra Raiders and the Sydney Roosters at ANZ Stadium.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joel Carrett/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-06T07:58:05.437Z\">at 8.58am BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "The Roosters were superb all season and they end it worthy champions. They defeated Melbourne Storm, South Sydney and Canberra Raiders in the finals with some of the finest defensive displays imaginable. They rode their luck tonight - especially with that phantom call for another set to the Raiders - but they took full advantage in the most thrilling fashion. The Raiders can hold their heads high. It surely won\u2019t be another 25 years before they\u2019re back on the big stage. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. Thank you for your company. Unsurprisingly, the team of referees, led by Ben Cummins, are roundly booed when they arrive on the dais to accept their medals. Not often you see a player from the losing side claim man of the match honours but Canberra\u2019s halfback put on an excellent show and scored his team\u2019s only try. Sia Soliola has been awarded the Ken Stephen medal. The honour recognises the efforts of an NRL player who has not only achieved on the field, but has committed time off the field to community projects. \u201cIt\u2019s an honour to be talked about in the same sentence as Artie Beetson,\u201d says Boyd Cordner about skippering consecutive Roosters premierships. \u201cIt feels like a punch in the stomach\u201d says a disconsolate Josh Hodgson. That\u2019s to take nothing away from the Roosters who defended bravely all night, including a ten-minute spell with just 12 men on the field. Raiders fans can feel hard done to by the referees. That overturned call before the Roosters scored was the decisive moment in the match. It will be fascinating to see what the NRL comes out with in their defence. I don\u2019t know how they did it, but they did. Somehow, despite defending for almost the entirety of the second half the Roosters repelled the Raiders and are the 2019 premiers. Cooper Cronk retires a champion. Sydney Roosters go back-to-back! 79 mins: Roosters 14-8 Raiders: Safe set from the Roosters, full of slow restarts and ending with a kick that goes out of touch off a Raider who did not play at the ball. One final set for Canberra to rescue something. 77 mins: Roosters 14-8 Raiders: Friend has been canny since he came on and he gains metres again by timing a superb pass to the onrushing Tedesco. Canberra are going to have do something miraculous to score from the final couple of plays with no field position. 75 mins: Roosters 14-8 Raiders: That refereeing signal on the Canberra attack immediately before the Roosters scored is the story of the grand final. Mitchell rams home his side\u2019s unlikely advantage. That previous Roosters salvo has restored some balance back to this contest after the Raiders onslaught but Canberra have the bit between their teeth again after a bomb bounces back their way off a blue jersey. But, hang on, despite the onfield referee signalling a repeat set there\u2019s a handover at the next tackle. What happened there!? Sydney don\u2019t care, they break down the left through Mitchell\u2019s wonderful offload, Tupou\u2019s pace, and Tedesco\u2019s support play. The man of the year dives over and, improbably, the Roosters are back in front. In other news, cramp looks to have ended Nicoll-Klokstad\u2019s night. 69 mins: Roosters 8-8 Raiders: Mitchell tugs his penalty attempt wide from about 35m out. Let-off for the Raiders. 67 mins: Roosters 8-8 Raiders: Another spell of attacking play from the Raiders ends with Morris pulling down yet another high ball into his corner - and finally, after long last - there\u2019s a line-break to ease the pressure, Taukeiaho skipping along the turf to the delight of Roosters fans. The kick at the end of the set is knocked-on in the air by the Raiders and as soon as Sydney reclaim possession there\u2019s a penalty for a high tackle and Mitchell has an opportunity to kick his side back in front. 65 mins: Roosters 8-8 Raiders: The Raiders keep chipping away through the middle but whenever they look to expand or try something funky they either lack execution or the Roosters are just too good defensively. However, Easts are always on the back foot and exhausted when they regain the ball giving them no options to stop the onslaught. If this was boxing, the Raiders are controlling the centre of the ring but they can\u2019t find the knockout blow. 62 mins: Roosters 8-8 Raiders: The Roosters do the basics in possession again - they\u2019ve barely offered anything in attack this half - and the Raiders have to build from deep once again. They make it as far as halfway before Nicoll-Klokstad is grounded with cramp. He gets up and returns to the fray seconds later though, counterattacking after collecting a charge-down, setting the Raiders for another assault. On the last tackle of that set Sezer goes aerially to the corner but Morris is safe with his feet off the ground and is happy to concede a drop-out. It has been all Canberra since half-time but they have yet to make it count. 60 mins: Roosters 8-8 Raiders: The Raiders have struggled to create much from these kind of situations all night and they look blunt again until Leilua has a two-on-one on the right wing but instead of just catching and passing he accepts contact and slips the offload fractionally forward letting the Roosters off the hook. 59 mins: Roosters 8-8 Raiders: Ohhhh, just when the Roosters were starting to take the sting out of the contest Lui drops the ball in contact, seconds before Cronk returns, and the Raiders have set-piece ball just beyond halfway. 57 mins: Roosters 8-8 Raiders: The Raiders have struggled to assert themselves since Cronk\u2019s sin-binning. Morris\u2019s spectacular leaping take denies them a repeat set and an opportunity to establish field position. Instead, the Roosters drive safely downfield and force Canberra to attack from deep, a task near impossible against this brilliant defensive wall. 54 mins: Roosters 8-8 Raiders: Superb defence from the Roosters pins the Raiders inside their own half for a full set. They respond in possession by stuffing the ball up the jersey of five different forwards before Friend cleverly kicks to touch to slow the game down. Confirmation, belatedly, that Aubusson is out of the game following that awkward fall early in the game. 52 mins: Roosters 8-8 Raiders: The Raiders are buzzing now, keeping the ball alive in possession and chasing like dervishes when they kick. The Roosters just have to weather this storm and they do so for the time being, with the help of Jake Friend who\u2019s now on the field. Croker makes no mistake from point-blank range. The Raiders already had the momentum, now, can they make it count in the next ten minutes against 14 men? 50 mins: Roosters 8-6 Raiders: Canberra look immediately dangerous from their next set, Nicoll-Klokstad breaking a tackle down the right and wriggling towards the line before he\u2019s stopped. From the next play Papali hits the pass on the burst but the ball goes to ground. What happened there? Was it a professional foul? Cronk tackled the man before he received possession and the TMO has confirmed a professional foul. Ten minutes in the bin too for Cronk! Oof, that was close to a penalty try as well. Drama at ANZ Stadium! 49 mins: Roosters 8-6 Raiders: After that frenetic start to the half both sides are now happy to keep things safe and central before inviting a halfback to roost the ball into the Sydney sky. That to-me, to-you, dance ends with the Roosters conceding a needless penalty at the ruck allowing the Raiders another attacking burst. 47 mins: Roosters 8-6 Raiders: The Raiders are pushing and pushing and have come out after half-time with much more attacking verve. But, oh, one offload too many hands possession back to the Roosters and the momentum is halted. Sydney drive all the way down to the Canberra 10m line meaning that despite the best lung busting efforts of Papali the Raiders have to settle for field position. 44 mins: Roosters 8-6 Raiders: That set begins well with Papali finding an offload, and gets even better after four tackles when Leilua breaks the line. The final passage is dangerous with play switching to the left but the finishing touch eludes Canberra with Tedesco on hand to touch down in-goal. 43 mins: Roosters 8-6 Raiders: The Raiders have the first hit-up of the half, and not for the first time tonight they kick before they need to. The Roosters attack from their own 30m line and drive to about the same distance from the Raiders\u2019 line allowing Cronk to stab a kick forward that is defused with ease. Almost immediately Canberra benefit from an infringement at the play-the-ball. 41 mins: Roosters 8-6 Raiders: The second half is underway! Both sides did superbly defensively in that first half. The Roosters looked impregnable while the Raiders managed to keep Tedesco and Mitchell quiet. Not a lot to shout about in the half-time stats. Both teams have high completion rates, low error counts, and, crucially, just one line-break apiece. Individually, Waerea-Hargreaves is the first and only man to pass 100m with ball in hand. He\u2019s also the only man with more than eight carries. Mitchell drags his left-footed penalty from the right touchline wide and there\u2019s just two points separating the sides at the interval. 40 mins: Roosters 8-6 Raiders: The Roosters take no risks with their final set of the half until Cronk kicks high to the right corner. Canberra claim the bomb but there\u2019s a whistle - a well-spotted penalty against Croker for obstructing Morris. Mitchell will kick after the siren... 38 mins: Roosters 8-6 Raiders: Ill discipline from the Roosters gifts Canberra good field position. For the first time tonight Nicoll-Klokstad has a look but the Roosters hold him up despite a fierce burst. The ball gets shuffled left and Croker is then inches away from snaffling a teasing kick. This is turning into a fair old end-to-end ding-dong. 36 mins: Roosters 8-6 Raiders: It\u2019s been all Sydney since the Raiders scored, and another set in Raiders territory almost led to tries to Tupou and Mitchell down the left before desperate defence - led by Croker - keeps them at bay and forces the turnover. That felt like an important passage of play for Canberra. They withstood a fierce burst from a stung Sydney and they remain standing. 33 mins: Roosters 8-6 Raiders: The Raiders handover possession cheaply about 10m out from their own line early in the set following the restart. Can the Roosters capitalise? No - they don\u2019t fall far short but Keary\u2019s grubber is tipped out of harm\u2019s way with Cordner circling. Croker adds a couple more points and it is game on at ANZ Stadium. And from that set the Raiders score their opening try of the grand final. After a long spell of Raiders pressure the Roosters finally started to look fatigued and Wighton took a couple of steps off his left to profit from that uncertainty. It was coming. 30 mins: Roosters 8-0 Raiders: Mitchell kicks this time after a lacklustre set from the Roosters. The Raiders might just be getting the upper hand in close now. Can they find some inspiration with ball in hand? Hodgson tries, then Sezer, but there are no gaps in the Roosters defence. Wighton has to kick but this time the Roosters spill the bomb into the corner and the Raiders get another set... 29 mins: Roosters 8-0 Raiders: Another solid set from the Roosters sees JWH become the first man to carry for over 100m for the night. The Raiders respond positively but again decent field position ends without much adventure and the bomb to the corner is accepted by the Roosters without fanfare. 27 mins: Roosters 8-0 Raiders: A rare Raiders offload deep in their own half creates some broken play. From the resulting tackle - the third of the set - Hodgson kicks deep into the left corner and Morris lets it roll out for the scrum. 25 mins: Roosters 8-0 Raiders: Canberra get deep into Roosters territory before they get another set following a Sydney hand interfering with the play-the-ball. They can\u2019t capitalise though because this awesome tricolour wall is smothering everything in every direction and eventually it forces an error. It is hard to see how the Raiders are going to get through tonight. 23 mins: Roosters 8-0 Raiders: First proper handling error of the night from the Roosters and it\u2019s that man Radley, fresh from a whack on the face, he drops the ball in a straightforward passage of play. He immediately exits the game for a HIA and we all scratch our heads at the treatment of concussion and head injuries in professional sport. The Roosters extend their lead with a penalty from 35m out directly in front after Tapine\u2019s swinging arm caught Radley\u2019s nose in a poorly executed tackle. 19 mins: Roosters 6-0 Raiders: Another safe Roosters set ends with Cronk kicking from halfway. The highlight of the passage was a solid tackle on Cordner that shook captain Chook. The Raiders pack aren\u2019t hitting the line as hard as their Roosters counterparts, meaning the halfback kicking game is much more conservative, allowing Tedesco, Tupou and Morris plenty of time to pouch and counterattack. 17 mins: Roosters 6-0 Raiders: Tedesco makes his first decent metres of the night to set up field position for Cronk to launch an almighty Garryowen that almost comes back Sydney\u2019s side. Canberra survive and we\u2019re back into forward exchanges down the centre of the pitch. 15 mins: Roosters 6-0 Raiders: The Raiders have the luxury of a full set within striking distance but the Roosters defence is intimidatingly good. There is no chink in the armour with holes being plugged in the middle and runners covered left and right. A limp attack ends with a grubber deflected out of play off a green hand. 14 mins: Roosters 6-0 Raiders: The Roosters gain little ground on their set allowing the Raiders, backed by a vociferous crowd, to launch another attack. Their set ends with Wighton again going to his boot but he\u2019s stopped illegally in his chase and Canberra get a penalty in a dangerous area. Bad news for the Roosters with Aubusson limping off in the hands of trainers with what looks to be a left knee injury. 12 mins: Roosters 6-0 Raiders: First decent attacking territory for the Raiders following that penalty. Papalii and Hodgson drive them forward then Wighton kicks unexpectedly on tackle four, the ball claimed in the air near the left corner but possession can\u2019t be recycled back with enough space to cross. 10 mins: Roosters 6-0 Raiders The Raiders can\u2019t catch a break. The Roosters are on the attack straight away from the restart, helped by an infringement at the play-the-ball handing them repeat sets. It\u2019s nearly seven minutes between possession for the Raiders and when they do get their hands on the ball it\u2019s on their own try line. They do finally get a respite when a third defender flops on the prone carrier and concedes a very sloppy penalty. The most prolific scorer in the competition doesn\u2019t miss from there. The Roosters have just been coming and coming since the start of their second set and finally the green wall is pierced by Sam Verrills. Sydney\u2019s halves probed one way then the other eventually settling on the right flank before Verrills spotted a gap and dived just to the side of the uprights. 5 mins: Roosters 0-0 Raiders: From that set-piece the Roosters snipe on both edges before Cordner scrambles his way towards the line but he\u2019s held up on his back. From the next play Keary tests the Raiders with a nice bomb that ends with a line drop-out. The Roosters making the early running. 4 mins: Roosters 0-0 Raiders: The first incident of the night arrives towards the end of the Roosters\u2019 second set. Keary is late on his kick and it\u2019s charged down by the head of Soliola. The ball ricochets at speed downfield but strikes the Roosters\u2019 trainer! It all ends with a Sydney scrum. 2 mins: Roosters 0-0 Raiders: Solid opening set from the Roosters. Waerea-Hargreaves took the first carry, of course, then the fifth, bulldozing his way down the middle of the field. The Raiders regained possession 30m out from their own line and kept ball in hand safely to establish a foothold before kicking high to Tedesco. Safe and sound from both sides early doors. The Raiders have struck the opening kick and we\u2019re underway in the 2019 NRL grand final! Nothing says NRL grand final quite like Natalie Bassingthwaighte singing the national anthem, so that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got. Thankfully the rugby league has intervened. The Provan-Summons trophy has been carried carefully onto the ANZ Stadium turf, and the two sides are out. There\u2019s a massive wallop of a viking clap at one end, fireworks and tricolour banners at the other. \u201cWhat do you see when you look deep into a person\u2019s soul?\u201d asks Billy Slater, on the telly. That can only mean the lengthy pregame montage has begun. No prizes for guessing the favourite for the Clive Churchill Medal. James Tedesco has swept all the individual awards so far this season and as the dominant force in rugby league the Roosters fullback is the man to stop. \u201cWe\u2019re the only people who don\u2019t believe we are mate,\u201d says Ricky Stuart to Darren Lockyer when asked about his side being underdogs. Stuart, remember, has won premierships with both clubs in his time in the game. Trent Robinson? \u201cI feel good. Ready to get it on.\u201d The Raiders have the luxury of an unchanged 17 despite a couple of scares earlier in the week to Josh Hodgson (flu) and Joey Leilua (concussion). 1. Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad, 2. Nick Cotric, 3. Jarrod Croker (C), 4. Joey Leilua, 5. Jordan Rapana, 6. Jack Wighton, 7. Aidan Sezer, 8. Josh Papalii, 9. Josh Hodgson (C), 10. Sia Soliola, 11. John Bateman, 12. Elliott Whitehead, 13. Joe Tapine, 14. Bailey Simonsson, 15. Emre Guler, 16. Corey Horsburgh, 17. Dunamis Lui Two changes for the Roosters from the squad that downed the Storm, one expected, one a significant late surprise. The big call is the last-minute inclusion of Jake Friend on the interchange bench. The hooker and co-captain has only featured five times this season and has recently been battling a calf strain following a long absence with a fractured arm. Zane Tetevano is the unlucky man to miss out. Jared Waerea-Hargreaves is the other inclusion following his preliminary final suspension. He starts ahead of Siosiua Taukeiaho with Lindsay Collins missing out altogether. 1. James Tedesco, 2. Daniel Tupou, 3. Latrell Mitchell, 4. Joseph Manu, 5. Brett Morris, 6. Luke Keary, 7. Cooper Cronk, 8. Jared Waerea-Hargreaves, 9. Sam Verrills, 10. Isaac Liu, 11. Boyd Cordner (c), 12. Mitchell Aubusson, 13. Victor Radley, 14. Angus Crichton, 15. Zane Tetevano, 16. Nat Butcher, 17. Siosiua Taukeiaho Canberra have won the toss and they will kick-off tonight. It\u2019s a warm dry night in Sydney with temperatures in the low 20s. The northerly that\u2019s currently skipping across ANZ Stadium will die down during the game. The contrast between the two clubs and their supporter bases this grand final is stark. The Roosters are success personified. The Raiders meanwhile are busy building a brand new bright green bandwagon. \u201cI know we\u2019re American,\u201d says Ryan Tedder, \u201cbut we love our footy.\u201d It does feel more like a summer blue light festival at the moment, rather than a first grade granny, but the kids look to be enjoying themselves. *Shrug emoji*. The pregame is underway at ANZ Stadium. Sam Thaiday has just introduced One Republic, who are doing their dance pop thang on halfway surrounded by a gaggle of delighted teenage girls. Hello everybody and welcome to live set-by-set coverage of the 2019 NRL grand final between the Sydney Roosters and Canberra Raiders from ANZ Stadium. The action is scheduled to get underway sometime after 7.30pm. We should be in for a closely fought contest tonight between two of the standout sides of 2019. They have both beaten the minor premiers Melbourne Storm this finals campaign, the Raiders doing so at AAMI Park three weeks ago to turbocharge their pursuit of the Provan-Summons Trophy. It\u2019s 25 years since they were last on this grandest of stages so the Green Machine are arriving with nothing to lose, and plenty of sentimental support. By contrast the Roosters are old hands at this NRL grand final lark. This is their eighth since the turn of the millennium and as defending champions they\u2019re bidding to go back-to-back for the first time in a generation. It\u2019s second vs fourth from the regular season ladder with the Roosters holding the upper hand. They also won both the head-to-head match-ups this year but by margins of just six and four points. It\u2019s clear who the favourites should be, but grand finals have a habit of upsetting the form book. If you want to drop me a line before the action gets underway you can do so by email or via Twitter.",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s hard to believe that when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/alicecooper\">Alice Cooper</a> emerged in the early 70s, his horror makeup, songs about sex and death and theatrical hangings were seen as a threat to the moral fibre of society. Today, while the shock-rock pioneer\u2019s vast influence stretches from punk to \u201cantichrist superstar\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/marilyn-manson\">Marilyn Manson</a>, he\u2019s more pantomime villain than shocking. Where Cooper once channelled the feeling of unease in the post-summer-of-love era, these days his show is considerably more \u201cHe\u2019s behind you!\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s still a great night out. The former hell-raiser may now spend much of his time as Vincent Furnier \u2013 a mild-mannered, sober, married man who prefers the celebrity golf circuit to horror \u2013 but he can slip on the old persona as easily as a golf shoe.</p> <p>It certainly takes chutzpah for a 71-year-old to begin a concert with a droll song called Feed My Frankenstein, about his insatiable libido, while sharing the stage with a giant monster. Cooper\u2019s deathly croak may have lost a smidgeon of its power but he looks even more as if he has been recently exhumed from the nearest cemetery. He is part-ham, part-showman, the Phantom of the Opera reincarnated as a rock god.</p> <p>He strides out of his \u201cnightmare castle\u201d, with top hat and twirling cane, and kisses a ghost bride (his wife, Sheryl Goddard) who disappears in smoke. Half the time it\u2019s like a low-budget slasher movie soundtracked by hard glam rock, especially when an actor has her throat theatrically slashed by a sabre-wielding masked slayer. The sight of the straitjacketed singer being restrained from attacking a baby (thankfully, a doll) with a meat cleaver is slightly more disturbing (and has reportedly led to some American punters walking out in disgust). Cooper, though, gets his comeuppance \u2013 by being apparently guillotined. The giant contraption and fake \u201cAlice\u201d head have been part of the act for aeons.</p> <p>He\u2019s never stopped releasing new music \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMd8K9DxG0I&amp;list=OLAK5uy_mwoP4GVFiQqboWrfWXycuvfDUpkmvL-Ds\">Breadcrumbs EP</a> came out only last week \u2013 but it\u2019s mostly ignored in favour of live staples from his heyday. Still, 1970\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ1MdRgU7Hw\">I\u2019m Eighteen</a> \u2013 a song with which Johnny Rotten auditioned for the Sex Pistols \u2013 packs a new kind of raw power as Cooper rages against infirmity.</p> <p>There\u2019s enough in his mammoth catalogue for him to leave out classics such as Elected and Only Women Bleed in favour of the hair-metal anthem <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUhjIoDC7Pg\">Poison</a> and proto-goth I Love the Dead. A youngish band featuring guitarist Nita Strauss and drummer Glen Sobel make Under My Wheels and No More Mr Nice Guy rock vigorously.</p> <p>Cooper ends, as ever, with 1972\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Oo8QzDHimQ\">School\u2019s Out</a>.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s hard to believe that when Alice Cooper emerged in the early 70s, his horror makeup, songs about sex and death and theatrical hangings were seen as a threat to the moral fibre of society. Today, while the shock-rock pioneer\u2019s vast influence stretches from punk to \u201cantichrist superstar\u201d Marilyn Manson, he\u2019s more pantomime villain than shocking. Where Cooper once channelled the feeling of unease in the post-summer-of-love era, these days his show is considerably more \u201cHe\u2019s behind you!\u201d It\u2019s still a great night out. The former hell-raiser may now spend much of his time as Vincent Furnier \u2013 a mild-mannered, sober, married man who prefers the celebrity golf circuit to horror \u2013 but he can slip on the old persona as easily as a golf shoe. It certainly takes chutzpah for a 71-year-old to begin a concert with a droll song called Feed My Frankenstein, about his insatiable libido, while sharing the stage with a giant monster. Cooper\u2019s deathly croak may have lost a smidgeon of its power but he looks even more as if he has been recently exhumed from the nearest cemetery. He is part-ham, part-showman, the Phantom of the Opera reincarnated as a rock god. He strides out of his \u201cnightmare castle\u201d, with top hat and twirling cane, and kisses a ghost bride (his wife, Sheryl Goddard) who disappears in smoke. Half the time it\u2019s like a low-budget slasher movie soundtracked by hard glam rock, especially when an actor has her throat theatrically slashed by a sabre-wielding masked slayer. The sight of the straitjacketed singer being restrained from attacking a baby (thankfully, a doll) with a meat cleaver is slightly more disturbing (and has reportedly led to some American punters walking out in disgust). Cooper, though, gets his comeuppance \u2013 by being apparently guillotined. The giant contraption and fake \u201cAlice\u201d head have been part of the act for aeons. He\u2019s never stopped releasing new music \u2013 the Breadcrumbs EP came out only last week \u2013 but it\u2019s mostly ignored in favour of live staples from his heyday. Still, 1970\u2019s I\u2019m Eighteen \u2013 a song with which Johnny Rotten auditioned for the Sex Pistols \u2013 packs a new kind of raw power as Cooper rages against infirmity. There\u2019s enough in his mammoth catalogue for him to leave out classics such as Elected and Only Women Bleed in favour of the hair-metal anthem Poison and proto-goth I Love the Dead. A youngish band featuring guitarist Nita Strauss and drummer Glen Sobel make Under My Wheels and No More Mr Nice Guy rock vigorously. Cooper ends, as ever, with 1972\u2019s School\u2019s Out. Scores of huge black balloons tumble from the ceiling, and the sight of grown men and women cascading over their seats to burst them is as comical and faintly disturbing as anything in the show. \u2022 At First Direct Arena, Leeds, 7 October. Then touring.",

The last of the world\u2019s most massive trees now live on just 73 groves scattered across the Sierras.

Now, in an ambitious bid to secure a future for them, a conservation group has struck an unusual deal to acquire the last, largest privately owned sequoia grove.</p> <p>The deal is the result of two decades of discussions between the not-for-profit conservation group Save the Redwoods and the Rouch family, which has owned the 530-acre Alder Creek grove since before the second world war. The forest is home to hundreds of sequoias, including the Stagg Tree which \u2013 at more than 240ft tall and 100ft around \u2013 is the fifth-largest in the world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"39d6f19bb8f7de8bd7205dca61ab0be9c97f03f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39d6f19bb8f7de8bd7205dca61ab0be9c97f03f8/0_100_5652_3391/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A conservation group has struck an unusual deal to acquire the last, largest privately owned sequoia grove.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A conservation group has struck an unusual deal to acquire the last, largest privately owned sequoia grove.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lee Nicholson/Guardian Community</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Rouches agreed to sell their land for $15m, which the organization hopes to raise by the end of this year. Once they acquire the land, the group plans to work with ecologists to help the forest build resilience against global heating and its catastrophic consequences,</p> <p>\u201cThe forest is truly ancient,\u201d said Sam Hodder, the president of Save the Redwoods. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve now got this extraordinary, unique opportunity to restore and protect it.\u201d</p> <p>Although sequoias have evolved to withstand temperature changes, extreme heat and fire, drought and destructive wildfires are now proving to be the biggest threats to their survival.</p> <p>Curiously, decades of humans fighting fires has made the problem worse.</p> <p>\u201cGiant sequoias really need wildfire,\u201d explained Kristen Shive, a forest ecologist with Save the Redwoods. Their cones are cued up to open with the heat of a fire, releasing seeds that like to germinate in freshly burned, fertile forest floor.</p> <p>For millions of years, \u201csequoias adapted to survive and thrive with regular, low-level fires\u201d, Shive says. With their thick barks and high crowns, most mature giant sequoias are immune to fires that burn though almost everything else around them. \u201cBut over the past century, we moved in, and started stopping fires everywhere.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8c4d2a9b1c382cfbacd41cb30d76dbe8059c3ecb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c4d2a9b1c382cfbacd41cb30d76dbe8059c3ecb/0_262_5150_3090/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Most giant sequoias lie within protected national parks.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Most giant sequoias lie within protected national parks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Woody debris began to accumulate on the forest floor, and small trees and saplings began to overcrowd it. \u201cThat serves as kindling,\u201d Shive says, feeding fires that burn longer, and hotter than sequoias can bear. Smaller trees serve as \u201cladders\u201d, allowing the fires to climb up to the sequoia\u2019s crowns and kill them.</p> <p>Climate change hasn\u2019t helped.

      "bodyText": "Few living beings have experienced as much as the giant sequoias. With ancestors dating back to the Jurassic era, some of the trees that now grow along California\u2019s Sierra Nevada Mountains been alive for thousands of years, bearing witness to most of human history \u2013 from the fall of the Roman empire to the rise of Beyonc\u00e9. But a couple hundred years of human encroachment on to the sequoias\u2019 habitat, combined with the climate crisis, increasingly intense wildfires, and drought have threatened the species\u2019 future. The last of the world\u2019s most massive trees now live on just 73 groves scattered across the Sierras. Most lie within protected national parks such as Sequoia national park, where visitors flock from around the world to marvel at General Sherman, the world\u2019s most massive tree. But not all sequoias are protected within the parks system. Now, in an ambitious bid to secure a future for them, a conservation group has struck an unusual deal to acquire the last, largest privately owned sequoia grove. The deal is the result of two decades of discussions between the not-for-profit conservation group Save the Redwoods and the Rouch family, which has owned the 530-acre Alder Creek grove since before the second world war. The forest is home to hundreds of sequoias, including the Stagg Tree which \u2013 at more than 240ft tall and 100ft around \u2013 is the fifth-largest in the world. The Rouches agreed to sell their land for $15m, which the organization hopes to raise by the end of this year. Once they acquire the land, the group plans to work with ecologists to help the forest build resilience against global heating and its catastrophic consequences, \u201cThe forest is truly ancient,\u201d said Sam Hodder, the president of Save the Redwoods. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve now got this extraordinary, unique opportunity to restore and protect it.\u201d Although sequoias have evolved to withstand temperature changes, extreme heat and fire, drought and destructive wildfires are now proving to be the biggest threats to their survival. Curiously, decades of humans fighting fires has made the problem worse. \u201cGiant sequoias really need wildfire,\u201d explained Kristen Shive, a forest ecologist with Save the Redwoods. Their cones are cued up to open with the heat of a fire, releasing seeds that like to germinate in freshly burned, fertile forest floor. For millions of years, \u201csequoias adapted to survive and thrive with regular, low-level fires\u201d, Shive says. With their thick barks and high crowns, most mature giant sequoias are immune to fires that burn though almost everything else around them. \u201cBut over the past century, we moved in, and started stopping fires everywhere.\u201d Woody debris began to accumulate on the forest floor, and small trees and saplings began to overcrowd it. \u201cThat serves as kindling,\u201d Shive says, feeding fires that burn longer, and hotter than sequoias can bear. Smaller trees serve as \u201cladders\u201d, allowing the fires to climb up to the sequoia\u2019s crowns and kill them. Climate change hasn\u2019t helped. Intense heat waves and drawn-out periods of drought have left California\u2019s forests drier, and more prone to wildfires. Droughts have also depleted giant sequoias, said Anthony Ambrose, a plant ecologist at the University of California, Berkeley, weakening them and leaving them vulnerable to possible bark beetle attacks. \u201cThere\u2019s a handful of giant sequoia trees that died in the recent drought,\u201d Ambrose said, probably from a combination of factors. \u201cRestoring these lands and stewarding these groves is going to be a big job,\u201d Ambrose said. \u201cIt takes a lot of money to take care of these lands.\u201d Save the Redwoods plans to make that investment in the coming years, as well as install trails and roads \u201cin a way that is mindful of the ecological sensitivity\u201d, said the CEO Hodder, before eventually transferring the land to National Parks. \u201cOnce it\u2019s ready, we really do want to give the public access to this area,\u201d Hodder said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s remarkable \u2013 the cinnamon bark, the incredible shades of green in the alpine meadows, that unique Sierra blue sky.\u201d \u201cI firmly believe that a walk in these woods can make you a better person,\u201d he said. Members of the Rouch family concur. \u201cWe talked to a few buyers over the years, but I\u2019m very happy we\u2019re selling it to Save the Redwoods,\u201d said Mike Rouch, who grew up in the forest, playing in the creeks and climbing the trees. Rouch\u2019s grandfather and father ran a logging business, and although they chopped down many fir, sugar pine and cedar trees to feed the family\u2019s lumber mill, they left most of the sequoias to stand. \u201cNobody in the family ever really wanted to cut them down,\u201d Rouch said. \u201cFor one, they\u2019re not very good, structural wood. And the other thing is you just have to look at them. They\u2019re so beautiful, and you realize once they\u2019re gone, they\u2019re gone.\u201d This article was amended on 9 October 2019 to clarify concerns over the effect of bark beetles on the sequoias.",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s three years since Ken Loach released <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/23/i-daniel-blake-ken-loach-review-mark-kermode\" title=\"\">I, Daniel Blake</a></em>, which won the Palme d\u2019Or at Cannes for its searing depiction of austerity-era Britain, with food banks a dismal fact of life and a benefits system that crushes rather than supports its supposed beneficiaries.</p> <p>Now Loach has turned his attention to another dehumanising trap of our neoliberal age: the world of zero-hours contracts. <em>Sorry We Missed You</em>, again set in Newcastle, tells the story of Ricky and Abbie, a fortysomething couple with two kids whose problems are less to do with finding work than stopping it from eating up their lives. Abbie, played by first-time actor Debbie Honeywood, is a home carer who covers the cost of her own travel between appointments and whose crammed schedule makes it impossible for her to bestow proper care on her vulnerable \u201cclients\u201d.</p> <p>Her husband, Ricky (Kris Hitchen), is a jobbing builder who has had enough of working for other people. Eager to earn extra money to get his family out of debt and into a house of their own, he applies for a driving job at a parcel-delivery company where he is told that \u201cyou don\u2019t work for us, you work <em>with</em> us\u2026\u201d</p> <p>What this means in practice is that Ricky has to provide his own vehicle, take responsibility for an expensive scanner that tracks and dictates his every move and face steep penalties if he takes time off work without arranging a replacement driver. Employment benefits such as sick and holiday pay don\u2019t factor here. \u201cYou\u2019re a master of your own destiny,\u201d is how the hard-faced branch manager puts it.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysjwg-MnZao\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ysjwg-MnZao?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysjwg-MnZao\">Watch a trailer for Sorry We Missed You.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>With this film, which also premiered to great acclaim at Cannes, the 83-year-old Loach and his regular screenwriter Paul Laverty are nothing if not timely. \u201cAn expertly judged and profoundly humane movie,\u201d noted the <em>Hollywood Reporter</em>. \u201cYou\u2019d have to be made of stone not to be moved to your core by it.\u201d</p> <p>In recent years, stories from the sharp edge of the gig economy have been filtering into the news with increasing regularity. In January 2018, Don Lane, a diabetic DPD courier from Dorset, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/05/courier-who-was-fined-for-day-off-to-see-doctor-dies-from-diabetes\" title=\"\">died of the condition after missing medical appointments</a> because he felt under pressure to keep working, facing \u00a3150 daily penalties if he failed to find cover for his shifts. (Lane had previously collapsed twice during his rounds, once while he was actually driving.)</p> <p>Drawing upon such stories, Loach and Laverty drill to the very heart of our contemporary work culture and ask piercing questions of the economic and political systems that support it. But what do the people working at the top of these systems make of the film? We asked politicians and thinktank heads from across the political spectrum to watch <em>Sorry We Missed You</em>, before its release next month, and share their responses.</p> <p><em>Sorry We Missed You opens on 1 November</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d2aa4ded1bf0ad20a0c18ab7b3981b24b2ab2f8f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2aa4ded1bf0ad20a0c18ab7b3981b24b2ab2f8f/99_0_1073_1049/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Frank Field\" width=\"1000\" height=\"978\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>\u2018Loach portrays the cruel, exposed underbelly of the labour market\u2019</strong><br><strong>Frank Field</strong><br></h2> <p><em>Frank Field has been the MP for Birkenhead since 1979 and is a specialist on poverty and welfare issues. </em><em>Last year, he resigned from the Labour party, saying it had become \u201ca force for antis</em><em>emitism\u201d; he now sits</em><em> as an independent</em></p> <p><em>Sorry We Missed You</em> is so remarkable. Even though I\u2019ve been exposed to the horrors it depicts, most recently through a series of reports I co-wrote with Andrew Forsey on the gig economy, I found the film deeply shocking and moving. For the many people who\u2019ve never come across these abuses \u2013 who don\u2019t realise what is going on in this cruel, exposed underbelly of the labour market \u2013 I can\u2019t imagine how they\u2019re going to react. Ken Loach is the great champion of taking us out of our shells and forcing us to ask, of the conveniences we enjoy: \u201cWho is actually paying for this?\u201d</p> <p>Andrew and I have written five reports over the past three years \u2013 on Hermes, Uber, DPD, Deliveroo and home care \u2013 which back up what is portrayed in the film, so no one can say: \u201cWell, he\u2019s just made this up.\u201d We\u2019ve heard stories of drivers who carry urine bottles and sick buckets because they dare not take time off. Two parents were threatened with loss of work while sitting at their dying little boy\u2019s bedside. One woman was on the operating table while her husband stood outside with Hermes on the phone, telling him he\u2019d \u201cbetter find cover\u201d for her.</p> <p>These sort of examples I think Dickens would have found hard to believe. But this is what is happening at the bottom end of the labour market.</p> <p>The gig economy is presented as a kind of freedom for workers and the people we spoke to were attracted by the idea of being able to dip in and out of work. But when [as a courier] you get that little black box, the scanner that issues directions and tracks your movements, you\u2019re trapped. It\u2019s very hard to escape because of the way the work is organised \u2013 the difficulties of hitting targets and the penalties you incur if you fail to hit them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4af27c787f32312ed1728e1b7a3ee943c09dfd69\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4af27c787f32312ed1728e1b7a3ee943c09dfd69/0_262_4000_2399/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Debbie Honeywood as home carer Abbie in Sorry We Missed You.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Debbie Honeywood as home carer Abbie in Sorry We Missed You.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Entertainment One</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This life of flexibility is fine, if that\u2019s what you actually want, but for millions of people, there is no other choice. They are being forced into self-employment as there is no other option. And then, as our reports and the film show, that regime gets you by the throat. It is a form of such exploitation that it would be very difficult for the supreme court to differentiate between this and other forms of modern slavery.</p> <p>The mother in the film works as a home carer. When I broke my arm and couldn\u2019t fully dress myself, I had a care worker and I talked to her about her job. As in the film, she would have appointments cancelled when she was nowhere near home and she\u2019d end up sitting around on park benches waiting for the next appointment; then she had to cover all the costs of travelling between appointments.</p> <p>The parents in the film are like ships in the night. They feed their children via the microwave and struggle to find time to go to the school when something goes wrong. If you want to devise the worst possible way of nurturing children, the gig economy has come up with a model. And if we don\u2019t have happy families in this country, where parents can love their children and nurture them, then we\u2019ll have real problems.</p> <p>What I\u2019m anxious to get across is that the situations in the film aren\u2019t just made up by Ken Loach\u2019s imagination. Behind this family slowly being destroyed by a wicked system, there are hundreds of examples of people who are similarly treated. This film is a very powerful shout for them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"92212622ba520419204474fef71af8051def0499\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92212622ba520419204474fef71af8051def0499/294_0_1047_1046/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anna Soubry\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>\u2018The film didn\u2019t have the passion and bite I expected\u2019</strong><br><strong>Anna Soubry</strong><br></h2> <p><em>Anna Soubry</em><em> was elected Conservative MP for Broxtowe in Nottinghamshire in 2010. </em><em>Strongly anti-Brexit, she resigned from the Tories in February to join the newly formed pro-EU party Change UK</em></p> <p>I have enjoyed Ken Loach films in the past \u2013 <em>Kes</em> I thought was stunning \u2013 but this film was far from his best. It didn\u2019t have the bite and passion that I expected and I thought it would have worked better as a documentary. With serious topics like this, either you cover it extremely well through drama, with a strong, balanced narrative, or you do it on a factual basis.</p> <p>I went to a tough comprehensive in Worksop, a Nottinghamshire mining town, so from an early age I have been aware that people with few or even low skills will struggle to get well-paid work. I also strongly believe every employer has a duty to treat anyone directly or indirectly in their employ with fairness, decency and respect, including paying them a fair living wage.</p> <p>I know there are problems with the gig economy. We\u2019re in an age where people are buying more online than in shops and that\u2019s fine \u2013 people have the right to buy online, and it suits a lot of us, but it means the things we buy have to be delivered. In my opinion, the prices people are paying for delivery are too low. So if we are to do the right thing by delivery drivers, then frankly we will all have to pay more for that service. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t use Uber \u2013 I take black cabs and minicabs, because I know that black-cab drivers have to pay all the associated taxes and insurance, and so it\u2019s worth paying extra.</p> <p>The same goes for care workers, like Abbie in the film. I have no doubt they\u2019re being underpaid. To pay them more, national government needs to give our councils more money, which is why you need a strong economy \u2013 and you don\u2019t get a strong economy by crashing out of the European Union without a deal or, indeed, leaving the EU in the first place.</p> <p>There are definitely some people \u2013 and I found this when I took evidence as a member of a select committee \u2013 who, due to their lifestyle and circumstances, choose to work in the gig economy because it suits them. In the film, the dad leaves his job in the construction industry to go down the self-employed route, but I didn\u2019t think it was really clear why he chose that. If he had lost his job at a time of high unemployment, he may well have had little choice and would have been more vulnerable to being exploited. Of course it can be physically challenging, but if you work in the construction industry, you tend to have a skill and you tend to be well paid. That\u2019s one area where I felt the credibility of the film was undermined.</p> <p>I\u2019ve had an example in my own constituency of migrant workers being extremely badly treated by a national employer. Based on the evidence I received from constituents, I went straight to the police and reported it and they raided the employer within two weeks. So I do have huge concerns about people being exploited at work, but the laws exist to protect them. You pick up the phone and you make a proper complaint.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2597b3218b43a718d585edff0d38f79f7b08f293\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2597b3218b43a718d585edff0d38f79f7b08f293/96_109_701_701/500.jpg\" alt=\"David Lammy\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>\u2018In this culture, the poor are sold a lie that they somehow have choice\u2019</strong><br><strong>David Lammy</strong><br></h2> <p><em>David Lammy</em><em> grew up in Tottenham, north London, and has been Labour MP for the constituency since 2000</em><br></p> <p>The term gig economy conveys Shoreditch-based twentysomething hipsters combining life as a playwright with working for Deliveroo. Ken Loach\u2019s polemic exposes that term as a euphemism for a much less glamorous reality. This gig economy is in fact based on zero-hours contracts and the callousness of a modern society that reduces everything to consumer choice. The opening scenes of the film show Ricky having a conversation with the delivery company manager as if he has agency over his decision to enter into this contract. In fact, his path is determined by the absence of a welfare state and a rolling back of hard-won labour rights. Instead of freedom, in this individualised culture, the poorest are sold a lie that they somehow have choice.</p> <p><em>Sorry We Missed You</em> is also about the decimation of family life. Both parents are living a zero-hours existence. Abbie works in social care, which is fundamental to an ageing population, helping and supporting vulnerable, disabled, elderly people, but is very poorly paid. Abbie is one of the most lovable characters, and you see her totally stripped of all her dignity in attempting to care for these individuals, because she\u2019s running from one place to the next with only a short amount of time for each person and no thanks or reward for her work.</p> <p>The film chimed with stories I\u2019ve heard from my own constituents. I will never forget the woman who came to my surgery having developed a very serious kidney infection and renal failure as a result of doing a job for a well-known supermarket where she was not allowed to go to the toilet while standing at her till. Similarly, Ricky has to pee into a bottle while he\u2019s driving because he doesn\u2019t have time for a toilet stop.

It would be wrong to romanticise the 40-hour week working for an employer, in contrast to the terrible gig economy, where everyone\u2019s exploited, because the reality is that people have the aspiration to control their own destinies.

I\u2019ve got a mother in a care home, and friends who are care workers, so I know what it\u2019s like. The film exemplified the brutality of a wonderful, empathetic carer being denied the right to do her job properly because her schedule prohibits it.

There\u2019s nothing wrong with delivering parcels and in some ways the technology is amazing. You can be cynical about tracking and big data, but what an amazing achievement that you can have a parcel delivered from anywhere around the world very quickly. Of course there is a human cost of that, but there must be ways of organising it that would be less brutal and more humane, where workers\u2019 rights are recognised. Let\u2019s look at improving the working conditions of the people who are doing the delivering, rather than just saying the whole thing is wrong.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ce4a2a8bd5d38271b41135487451fa64c4810200\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce4a2a8bd5d38271b41135487451fa64c4810200/212_0_1263_1263/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Littlewood\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>\u2018Of course drama is used to highlight the extremes, but Loach sure as hell highlighted them here\u2019</strong><br><strong>Mark Littlewood</strong></h2> <p><em>Mark Littlewood</em><em> is the director general of thinktank the Institute of Economic Affairs</em><em>.

But a relatively high proportion of workers in the gig economy would say that a great advantage of it is that, if your son gets in trouble at school or you fall ill, the flexibility you have is in fact considerably greater than if you are a nine-to-five, Monday-to-Friday, working-for-the-same-company-for-40-years sort of employee.</p> <p>The parcel-delivery firm in the film seems, to my understanding of it, pretty close to being on the wrong side of the law and if so, there should be legal sanction against it.

And I think it provides a legitimate point of concern about how normal families adapt to a much less certain, less secure working environment.</p> <p>But I was scratching my head thinking about the counterfactual: would these people have been better off in the pre-gig economy world? I don\u2019t really think they would have been, but for their horrific run of bad luck. I wonder whether Loach\u2019s film might have been a little stronger if the characters involved hadn\u2019t had all of the very worst things imaginable thrown at them.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s three years since Ken Loach released I, Daniel Blake, which won the Palme d\u2019Or at Cannes for its searing depiction of austerity-era Britain, with food banks a dismal fact of life and a benefits system that crushes rather than supports its supposed beneficiaries. Now Loach has turned his attention to another dehumanising trap of our neoliberal age: the world of zero-hours contracts. Sorry We Missed You, again set in Newcastle, tells the story of Ricky and Abbie, a fortysomething couple with two kids whose problems are less to do with finding work than stopping it from eating up their lives. Abbie, played by first-time actor Debbie Honeywood, is a home carer who covers the cost of her own travel between appointments and whose crammed schedule makes it impossible for her to bestow proper care on her vulnerable \u201cclients\u201d. Her husband, Ricky (Kris Hitchen), is a jobbing builder who has had enough of working for other people. Eager to earn extra money to get his family out of debt and into a house of their own, he applies for a driving job at a parcel-delivery company where he is told that \u201cyou don\u2019t work for us, you work with us\u2026\u201d What this means in practice is that Ricky has to provide his own vehicle, take responsibility for an expensive scanner that tracks and dictates his every move and face steep penalties if he takes time off work without arranging a replacement driver. Employment benefits such as sick and holiday pay don\u2019t factor here. \u201cYou\u2019re a master of your own destiny,\u201d is how the hard-faced branch manager puts it. With this film, which also premiered to great acclaim at Cannes, the 83-year-old Loach and his regular screenwriter Paul Laverty are nothing if not timely. \u201cAn expertly judged and profoundly humane movie,\u201d noted the Hollywood Reporter. \u201cYou\u2019d have to be made of stone not to be moved to your core by it.\u201d In recent years, stories from the sharp edge of the gig economy have been filtering into the news with increasing regularity. In January 2018, Don Lane, a diabetic DPD courier from Dorset, died of the condition after missing medical appointments because he felt under pressure to keep working, facing \u00a3150 daily penalties if he failed to find cover for his shifts. (Lane had previously collapsed twice during his rounds, once while he was actually driving.) Drawing upon such stories, Loach and Laverty drill to the very heart of our contemporary work culture and ask piercing questions of the economic and political systems that support it. But what do the people working at the top of these systems make of the film? We asked politicians and thinktank heads from across the political spectrum to watch Sorry We Missed You, before its release next month, and share their responses. Sorry We Missed You opens on 1 November \u2018Loach portrays the cruel, exposed underbelly of the labour market\u2019 Frank Field Frank Field has been the MP for Birkenhead since 1979 and is a specialist on poverty and welfare issues. Last year, he resigned from the Labour party, saying it had become \u201ca force for antisemitism\u201d; he now sits as an independent Sorry We Missed You is so remarkable. Even though I\u2019ve been exposed to the horrors it depicts, most recently through a series of reports I co-wrote with Andrew Forsey on the gig economy, I found the film deeply shocking and moving. For the many people who\u2019ve never come across these abuses \u2013 who don\u2019t realise what is going on in this cruel, exposed underbelly of the labour market \u2013 I can\u2019t imagine how they\u2019re going to react. Ken Loach is the great champion of taking us out of our shells and forcing us to ask, of the conveniences we enjoy: \u201cWho is actually paying for this?\u201d Andrew and I have written five reports over the past three years \u2013 on Hermes, Uber, DPD, Deliveroo and home care \u2013 which back up what is portrayed in the film, so no one can say: \u201cWell, he\u2019s just made this up.\u201d We\u2019ve heard stories of drivers who carry urine bottles and sick buckets because they dare not take time off. Two parents were threatened with loss of work while sitting at their dying little boy\u2019s bedside. One woman was on the operating table while her husband stood outside with Hermes on the phone, telling him he\u2019d \u201cbetter find cover\u201d for her. These sort of examples I think Dickens would have found hard to believe. But this is what is happening at the bottom end of the labour market. The gig economy is presented as a kind of freedom for workers and the people we spoke to were attracted by the idea of being able to dip in and out of work. But when [as a courier] you get that little black box, the scanner that issues directions and tracks your movements, you\u2019re trapped. It\u2019s very hard to escape because of the way the work is organised \u2013 the difficulties of hitting targets and the penalties you incur if you fail to hit them. This life of flexibility is fine, if that\u2019s what you actually want, but for millions of people, there is no other choice. They are being forced into self-employment as there is no other option. And then, as our reports and the film show, that regime gets you by the throat. It is a form of such exploitation that it would be very difficult for the supreme court to differentiate between this and other forms of modern slavery. The mother in the film works as a home carer. When I broke my arm and couldn\u2019t fully dress myself, I had a care worker and I talked to her about her job. As in the film, she would have appointments cancelled when she was nowhere near home and she\u2019d end up sitting around on park benches waiting for the next appointment; then she had to cover all the costs of travelling between appointments. The parents in the film are like ships in the night. They feed their children via the microwave and struggle to find time to go to the school when something goes wrong. If you want to devise the worst possible way of nurturing children, the gig economy has come up with a model. And if we don\u2019t have happy families in this country, where parents can love their children and nurture them, then we\u2019ll have real problems. What I\u2019m anxious to get across is that the situations in the film aren\u2019t just made up by Ken Loach\u2019s imagination. Behind this family slowly being destroyed by a wicked system, there are hundreds of examples of people who are similarly treated. This film is a very powerful shout for them. \u2018The film didn\u2019t have the passion and bite I expected\u2019 Anna Soubry Anna Soubry was elected Conservative MP for Broxtowe in Nottinghamshire in 2010. Strongly anti-Brexit, she resigned from the Tories in February to join the newly formed pro-EU party Change UK I have enjoyed Ken Loach films in the past \u2013 Kes I thought was stunning \u2013 but this film was far from his best. It didn\u2019t have the bite and passion that I expected and I thought it would have worked better as a documentary. With serious topics like this, either you cover it extremely well through drama, with a strong, balanced narrative, or you do it on a factual basis. I went to a tough comprehensive in Worksop, a Nottinghamshire mining town, so from an early age I have been aware that people with few or even low skills will struggle to get well-paid work. I also strongly believe every employer has a duty to treat anyone directly or indirectly in their employ with fairness, decency and respect, including paying them a fair living wage. I know there are problems with the gig economy. We\u2019re in an age where people are buying more online than in shops and that\u2019s fine \u2013 people have the right to buy online, and it suits a lot of us, but it means the things we buy have to be delivered. In my opinion, the prices people are paying for delivery are too low. So if we are to do the right thing by delivery drivers, then frankly we will all have to pay more for that service. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t use Uber \u2013 I take black cabs and minicabs, because I know that black-cab drivers have to pay all the associated taxes and insurance, and so it\u2019s worth paying extra. The same goes for care workers, like Abbie in the film. I have no doubt they\u2019re being underpaid. To pay them more, national government needs to give our councils more money, which is why you need a strong economy \u2013 and you don\u2019t get a strong economy by crashing out of the European Union without a deal or, indeed, leaving the EU in the first place. There are definitely some people \u2013 and I found this when I took evidence as a member of a select committee \u2013 who, due to their lifestyle and circumstances, choose to work in the gig economy because it suits them. In the film, the dad leaves his job in the construction industry to go down the self-employed route, but I didn\u2019t think it was really clear why he chose that. If he had lost his job at a time of high unemployment, he may well have had little choice and would have been more vulnerable to being exploited. Of course it can be physically challenging, but if you work in the construction industry, you tend to have a skill and you tend to be well paid. That\u2019s one area where I felt the credibility of the film was undermined. I\u2019ve had an example in my own constituency of migrant workers being extremely badly treated by a national employer. Based on the evidence I received from constituents, I went straight to the police and reported it and they raided the employer within two weeks. So I do have huge concerns about people being exploited at work, but the laws exist to protect them. You pick up the phone and you make a proper complaint. \u2018In this culture, the poor are sold a lie that they somehow have choice\u2019 David Lammy David Lammy grew up in Tottenham, north London, and has been Labour MP for the constituency since 2000 The term gig economy conveys Shoreditch-based twentysomething hipsters combining life as a playwright with working for Deliveroo. Ken Loach\u2019s polemic exposes that term as a euphemism for a much less glamorous reality. This gig economy is in fact based on zero-hours contracts and the callousness of a modern society that reduces everything to consumer choice. The opening scenes of the film show Ricky having a conversation with the delivery company manager as if he has agency over his decision to enter into this contract. In fact, his path is determined by the absence of a welfare state and a rolling back of hard-won labour rights. Instead of freedom, in this individualised culture, the poorest are sold a lie that they somehow have choice. Sorry We Missed You is also about the decimation of family life. Both parents are living a zero-hours existence. Abbie works in social care, which is fundamental to an ageing population, helping and supporting vulnerable, disabled, elderly people, but is very poorly paid. Abbie is one of the most lovable characters, and you see her totally stripped of all her dignity in attempting to care for these individuals, because she\u2019s running from one place to the next with only a short amount of time for each person and no thanks or reward for her work. The film chimed with stories I\u2019ve heard from my own constituents. I will never forget the woman who came to my surgery having developed a very serious kidney infection and renal failure as a result of doing a job for a well-known supermarket where she was not allowed to go to the toilet while standing at her till. Similarly, Ricky has to pee into a bottle while he\u2019s driving because he doesn\u2019t have time for a toilet stop. I have met countless constituents in my surgery who are close to falling asleep because they have come from a relentless shift in which they have not slept for days\u2013 so Ricky almost veering off the road due to lack of sleep felt very real. And I\u2019ve been into homes where there\u2019s a cloud of depression hanging over the parents; there\u2019s very little food in the fridge, they\u2019re in heavy debt and the children are trying to keep their parents\u2019 spirits up. In this film, too, you could feel the stress levels rising. It was palpable. I also thought of my childhood, when my mother was doing two or three jobs to support us. The idea goes back to Cathy Come Home and latchkey kids having to bring themselves up because their parents are working when they come home from school, and when the parents come home they\u2019re knackered, and I remember that in my own family life. Sorry We Missed You brings across how the right to a family life has been eroded in modern Britain. \u2018This should be seen by anyone thinking about social and elderly care\u2019 Claire Fox Claire Fox is founder and director of the Institute of Ideas thinktank and a regular panellist on the BBC Radio 4\u2019s Moral Maze. She is also a Brexit party MEP for North West England The film shows the flipside to the notion that the gig economy offers flexibility.

He was head of media for the Liberal Democrats from 2004 to 2007 and later an adviser to David Cameron I found this film less true to life than some of Ken Loach\u2019s work.

There are reports that actually matter. And then there\u2019s Beeching. Even now, 56 years after its release, you don\u2019t need to be a transport buff to know about the Beeching report. Following its publication in March 1963, hundreds of stations and thousands of miles of track were axed. The rail network was slimmed down on the grounds that many lines were underused and uneconomic. Beeching came out in the year Harold Wilson made his \u201cwhite heat of technology\u201d speech. Its premise was that the car was the future and rail the past. Cuts had been under way during the 1950s, and the feeling \u2013 exemplified by the Ealing comedy The Titfield Thunderbolt \u2013 was that railways were a legacy of the 19th century, of a pre-modern age. When Wilson became prime minister a year later, there was no attempt to halt the closure programme. Yet the history of the past half century shows that Beeching was a colossal mistake. Passenger numbers on trains are now higher than they were pre-1963 even though back then car usage was a lot lower. Beeching, in the words of his report, sought the \u201cselective development and intensive utilisation of a more limited trunk route system\u201d and that is broadly what Britain ended up with.

Coach Trent Robinson won a remarkable third premiership in just his seventh season as a head coach. Both are feats for the ages in what was a grand final for the ages. The wild start set the tone for what would be an epic encounter. Canberra attempted to wrestle back the ascendancy after going down early \u2013 getting as far as a held-up decision when Whitehead attempted to barge over in the 12th minute \u2013 but composure, or lackthereof, was hurting the Raiders, who continually alleviated pressure. A 20th minute penalty gave the Roosters an 8-0 lead and some breathing room, but a Mitch Aubusson knee injury that ended his night early and a sublime showing from Wighton finally saw the Raiders win back the arm wrestle. And it was that man Wighton, who kicked to perfection and ran with purpose, who crossed for Canberra\u2019s opener. There was nothing flashy about it.

      "body": "<p>The 2012 documentary film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/may/16/beware-of-mr-baker-review\">Beware of Mr Baker</a> is a profoundly discomfiting watch. The adjective regularly used to describe its subject is \u201ccantankerous\u201d, but that isn\u2019t really right. Cantankerous sounds like a word you would append to a beloved but grumpy old relation, and \u2013 in the film at least \u2013 there\u2019s nothing lovable whatsoever about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2013/may/15/ginger-baker-beware-mr-baker-interview\">Ginger Baker</a>.</p> <p>Sequestered in his South African compound, he seems authentically horrible: rude, obnoxious, arrogant, dismissive, violent. It doesn\u2019t seem to be an act put on for the camera. His children\u2019s relationship with him is clearly strained \u2013 on one occasion, his son recounts, they played a gig together that entailed his father giving the 15-year-old a line of cocaine, then absconding with their fee, leaving him stranded. His latest partner stares blankly and silently at the camera when asked whether he\u2019s a good stepfather. Even the man he describes as \u201chis best friend in the world\u201d, Eric Clapton, seems to regard him with a very wary eye: he \u201cdoesn\u2019t know him well\u201d, he says, before describing him as \u201cscary, threatening \u2026 difficult\u201d. It\u2019s hard not to find yourself wondering aloud why anyone would want to have made a film about Baker, simply because doing so would have meant spending time in his company.</p> <p>The answer, of course, lay in the music Baker made in the 1960s and 70s. By common consent, he helped to redefine the notion of the rock drummer, elevating the role from that of time-keeping backing musician to a star attraction. Devotees of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/19/ringo-starr-great-drummer-the-beatles-genius\">Ringo Starr</a> and the late <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2010/sep/08/archive-keith-moon-found-dead\">Keith Moon</a> \u2013 about whose playing Baker was characteristically contemptuous \u2013 might argue that he didn\u2019t do it singlehandedly, but there\u2019s no doubt that Baker\u2019s style of playing had an enormous impact.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ff8af5345dee7dfbc689a791e60f4b72807d8b45\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff8af5345dee7dfbc689a791e60f4b72807d8b45/0_0_3060_2044/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cream, from left to right: Jack Bruce, Ginger Baker, Eric Clapton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cream \u2026 (from left) Jack Bruce, Ginger Baker, Eric Clapton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He was also, on occasion, a musical visionary. He was among the first British musicians to cotton on to the revolutionary sound of Afrobeat being pioneered by Fela Kuti. Commendably unwilling simply to decorate his own music with Nigerian inflections, he immersed himself in Kuti\u2019s world, moving to Lagos, joining Africa \u201970 and setting up his own recording studio.</p> <p>You could hear Baker\u2019s jazz training on the records he cut with his first band, the Graham Bond Organisation, but he came into his own when he left Bond to form Cream. The gulf between the music on the Graham Bond Organisation\u2019s album The Sound of 65 and Cream\u2019s debut, <a href=\"http://www.classicrockreview.com/2011/10/1966-cream-fresh-cream/\">Fresh Cream</a> \u2013 recorded barely a year later \u2013 speaks volumes about the speed at which pop was moving in the mid-60s. The former is gritty but musicianly jazz-flecked rhythm and blues; the latter is expansive, experimental, heavily improvised and genuinely groundbreaking. You can hear the roots of everything from heavy metal to jam rock to the power trio format subsequently adopted by umpteen bands in its nine tracks.</p> <p>Cream\u2019s free-thinking approach to rock gave Baker space to thrive. Fresh Cream concluded with his track Toad, a five-minute showcase for his talents. Most rock drum solos are indescribably boring, but Toad is thrilling, testament to Baker\u2019s patented cocktail of swing, control and wildness.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9ey8dFqM98\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/z9ey8dFqM98?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Cream\u2019s catalogue is filled with examples of Baker\u2019s rhythmic invention \u2013 he transformed the single White Room by adding a \u201cBolero\u201d section in 5/4 time \u2013 and the trio were a sensation, albeit a short-lived one. Before the release of their third album, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/z6rg/\">Wheels </a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/z6rg/\">of Fire</a>, and barely 18 months after their debut, the band had split. Part of the problem was sheer exhaustion from touring and the band members\u2019 boredom with the ever-increasing volume of their live shows. But you might have predicted the band wouldn\u2019t last long from the start. Baker and bassist Jack Bruce had played together in the Graham Bond Organisation and loathed each other \u2013 Bruce had quit after Baker pulled a knife on him \u2013 a state of affairs not much helped by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jan/05/ginger-baker-cream-interview\">Baker\u2019s longstanding heroin problem</a>.</p> <p>Next, he joined Clapton and Steve Winwood in the short-lived supergroup Blind Faith, whose solitary album suffered both from hype and the sense that it was recorded in a rush. An underrated and idiosyncratic writer, as evidenced by Cream\u2019s Blue Condition and Pressed Rat and Warthog, Baker\u2019s Do What You Like had the makings of a charming song, but was allowed to ramble, unfocused, for 15 minutes. Not even a drum solo could save it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8d147f30d54d00185c88b4bba5b3ccda366e8e2c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d147f30d54d00185c88b4bba5b3ccda366e8e2c/114_68_2970_2426/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ginger Baker performing at the Forum theatre, Hatfield in 1980.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"817\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ginger Baker performing at the Forum theatre, Hatfield in 1980.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Heritage Images/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Blind Faith barely lasted long enough to complete a US tour, but Baker \u2013 frequently the onstage focus rather Winwood or the increasingly reticent Clapton \u2013 apparently enjoyed the experience, subsequently attempting to repeat the supergroup formula with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/19/ginger-baker-cream-blind-faith-interview-rocks-backpages\">Ginger Baker\u2019s Air Force</a>, ominously named after the section of Duke Ellington\u2019s orchestra comprised of heroin addicts. Recorded live, their eponymous debut was muffled, patchy and once again, wildly over-hyped, but it offered up a game and groundbreaking attempt to meld rock with jazz and the African music with which Baker was increasingly obsessed. A second, studio-recorded album also had moments when the fusion of styles gelled perfectly, not least the potent Graham Bond-penned closer 12 Gates of the City, but the Air Force\u2019s music simply wasn\u2019t commercial enough to bear the weight of expectation placed on it, nor the cost of transporting its vast lineup \u2013 which at one stage featured three percussionists \u2013 around on tour.</p> <p>By 1971, Baker was in Lagos, building a recording studio and collaborating with Fela Kuti, whom he\u2019d known since the early 60s, when Kuti \u2013 then studying in London \u2013 had begun hanging around Soho\u2019s jazz and blues clubs. A tireless booster of Kuti\u2019s work, Baker had helped him get gigs around London while still a member of Blind Faith. His work with Kuti and Africa \u201970 seemed to provide Baker with a respite from his post-Cream role as \u201csuperstar drummer\u201d. He got front-cover billing on Fela With Ginger Baker Live! and Kuti\u2019s subsequent studio album Why Black Man Dey Suffer, but what\u2019s striking about both is how seamlessly Baker fitted into Africa \u201970, happy for his contributions to be subservient to the band\u2019s fluid, polyrhythmic groove. A subsequent reissue of the former added a live drum duet between Baker and Kuti\u2019s regular percussionist Tony Allen, but for the most part, you wouldn\u2019t have noticed that the man behind Toad was there at all.</p> <p>Kuti returned the favour, appearing on Baker\u2019s solo album Stratavarious, a fantastic psychedelic Afro-rock confection that demonstrated how intuitively Baker grasped Nigerian music, but his African sojourn eventually came to grief. Stories about exactly what happened vary, but the upshot was Baker losing his studio and fleeing the country virtually penniless. He seemed to join yet another \u201csupergroup\u201d, the Baker Gurvitz Army, primarily out of financial necessity. There\u2019s nothing exactly wrong with their three albums of straightforward hard rock, but their contents are a long way from the innovations of Cream or Afrobeat or Stratavarious.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37sDbvQOJ2I\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/37sDbvQOJ2I?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>After their split, Baker\u2019s life seemed to descend into chaos, shot through with further tales of financial mismanagement and personal turmoil. He played on Hawkwind\u2019s 1980 album Levitation \u2013 you can spot him a mile off on Space Chase and closer Dust of Time \u2013 but otherwise largely retreated from music. Producer Bill Laswell involved him in the making of Public Image Limited\u2019s acclaimed 1986 album Album and had him record an instrumental solo album, Horses and Trees, that veered from world music fusion to experiments with sampling and scratching. However, by the late 80s, Baker was reduced to placing small ads in LA music magazines, looking for work.</p> <p>He spent the rest of his career dividing his time between session work and a succession of intriguing, if uneven, solo projects that lurched between world music (Ginger Baker: African Force), free improvisation (Unseen Rain; No Material, a challenging collaboration with saxophonist Peter Br\u00f6tzmann and others) and jazz: Going Back Home (1994) and Coward of the County (1999) both received critical praise, underlining that, unlike most of his rock peers, Baker could cut it as a straightforward jazz drummer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3c53b75db3831fa50ae739a1d6dfaeec26023b60\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c53b75db3831fa50ae739a1d6dfaeec26023b60/0_0_4368_2912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ginger Baker.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grim image \u2026 Ginger Baker in 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://ultimateclassicrock.com/cream-reunion-concerts/\">A brief Cream reunion in 2005</a> ended unhappily. Baker and Bruce\u2019s enmity had not been dimmed by the passing of time, Bruce wryly suggesting that things might be improved if Baker moved even further away from England than his new home in South Africa. Then came Beware of Mr Baker and a series of promotional interviews for the film that did nothing to undercut the grim image projected in it.

      "bodyText": "The 2012 documentary film Beware of Mr Baker is a profoundly discomfiting watch. The adjective regularly used to describe its subject is \u201ccantankerous\u201d, but that isn\u2019t really right. Cantankerous sounds like a word you would append to a beloved but grumpy old relation, and \u2013 in the film at least \u2013 there\u2019s nothing lovable whatsoever about Ginger Baker. Sequestered in his South African compound, he seems authentically horrible: rude, obnoxious, arrogant, dismissive, violent. It doesn\u2019t seem to be an act put on for the camera. His children\u2019s relationship with him is clearly strained \u2013 on one occasion, his son recounts, they played a gig together that entailed his father giving the 15-year-old a line of cocaine, then absconding with their fee, leaving him stranded. His latest partner stares blankly and silently at the camera when asked whether he\u2019s a good stepfather. Even the man he describes as \u201chis best friend in the world\u201d, Eric Clapton, seems to regard him with a very wary eye: he \u201cdoesn\u2019t know him well\u201d, he says, before describing him as \u201cscary, threatening \u2026 difficult\u201d. It\u2019s hard not to find yourself wondering aloud why anyone would want to have made a film about Baker, simply because doing so would have meant spending time in his company. The answer, of course, lay in the music Baker made in the 1960s and 70s. By common consent, he helped to redefine the notion of the rock drummer, elevating the role from that of time-keeping backing musician to a star attraction. Devotees of Ringo Starr and the late Keith Moon \u2013 about whose playing Baker was characteristically contemptuous \u2013 might argue that he didn\u2019t do it singlehandedly, but there\u2019s no doubt that Baker\u2019s style of playing had an enormous impact. He was also, on occasion, a musical visionary. He was among the first British musicians to cotton on to the revolutionary sound of Afrobeat being pioneered by Fela Kuti. Commendably unwilling simply to decorate his own music with Nigerian inflections, he immersed himself in Kuti\u2019s world, moving to Lagos, joining Africa \u201970 and setting up his own recording studio. You could hear Baker\u2019s jazz training on the records he cut with his first band, the Graham Bond Organisation, but he came into his own when he left Bond to form Cream. The gulf between the music on the Graham Bond Organisation\u2019s album The Sound of 65 and Cream\u2019s debut, Fresh Cream \u2013 recorded barely a year later \u2013 speaks volumes about the speed at which pop was moving in the mid-60s. The former is gritty but musicianly jazz-flecked rhythm and blues; the latter is expansive, experimental, heavily improvised and genuinely groundbreaking. You can hear the roots of everything from heavy metal to jam rock to the power trio format subsequently adopted by umpteen bands in its nine tracks. Cream\u2019s free-thinking approach to rock gave Baker space to thrive. Fresh Cream concluded with his track Toad, a five-minute showcase for his talents. Most rock drum solos are indescribably boring, but Toad is thrilling, testament to Baker\u2019s patented cocktail of swing, control and wildness. Cream\u2019s catalogue is filled with examples of Baker\u2019s rhythmic invention \u2013 he transformed the single White Room by adding a \u201cBolero\u201d section in 5/4 time \u2013 and the trio were a sensation, albeit a short-lived one. Before the release of their third album, Wheels of Fire, and barely 18 months after their debut, the band had split. Part of the problem was sheer exhaustion from touring and the band members\u2019 boredom with the ever-increasing volume of their live shows. But you might have predicted the band wouldn\u2019t last long from the start. Baker and bassist Jack Bruce had played together in the Graham Bond Organisation and loathed each other \u2013 Bruce had quit after Baker pulled a knife on him \u2013 a state of affairs not much helped by Baker\u2019s longstanding heroin problem. Next, he joined Clapton and Steve Winwood in the short-lived supergroup Blind Faith, whose solitary album suffered both from hype and the sense that it was recorded in a rush. An underrated and idiosyncratic writer, as evidenced by Cream\u2019s Blue Condition and Pressed Rat and Warthog, Baker\u2019s Do What You Like had the makings of a charming song, but was allowed to ramble, unfocused, for 15 minutes. Not even a drum solo could save it. Blind Faith barely lasted long enough to complete a US tour, but Baker \u2013 frequently the onstage focus rather Winwood or the increasingly reticent Clapton \u2013 apparently enjoyed the experience, subsequently attempting to repeat the supergroup formula with Ginger Baker\u2019s Air Force, ominously named after the section of Duke Ellington\u2019s orchestra comprised of heroin addicts. Recorded live, their eponymous debut was muffled, patchy and once again, wildly over-hyped, but it offered up a game and groundbreaking attempt to meld rock with jazz and the African music with which Baker was increasingly obsessed. A second, studio-recorded album also had moments when the fusion of styles gelled perfectly, not least the potent Graham Bond-penned closer 12 Gates of the City, but the Air Force\u2019s music simply wasn\u2019t commercial enough to bear the weight of expectation placed on it, nor the cost of transporting its vast lineup \u2013 which at one stage featured three percussionists \u2013 around on tour. By 1971, Baker was in Lagos, building a recording studio and collaborating with Fela Kuti, whom he\u2019d known since the early 60s, when Kuti \u2013 then studying in London \u2013 had begun hanging around Soho\u2019s jazz and blues clubs. A tireless booster of Kuti\u2019s work, Baker had helped him get gigs around London while still a member of Blind Faith. His work with Kuti and Africa \u201970 seemed to provide Baker with a respite from his post-Cream role as \u201csuperstar drummer\u201d. He got front-cover billing on Fela With Ginger Baker Live! and Kuti\u2019s subsequent studio album Why Black Man Dey Suffer, but what\u2019s striking about both is how seamlessly Baker fitted into Africa \u201970, happy for his contributions to be subservient to the band\u2019s fluid, polyrhythmic groove. A subsequent reissue of the former added a live drum duet between Baker and Kuti\u2019s regular percussionist Tony Allen, but for the most part, you wouldn\u2019t have noticed that the man behind Toad was there at all. Kuti returned the favour, appearing on Baker\u2019s solo album Stratavarious, a fantastic psychedelic Afro-rock confection that demonstrated how intuitively Baker grasped Nigerian music, but his African sojourn eventually came to grief. Stories about exactly what happened vary, but the upshot was Baker losing his studio and fleeing the country virtually penniless. He seemed to join yet another \u201csupergroup\u201d, the Baker Gurvitz Army, primarily out of financial necessity. There\u2019s nothing exactly wrong with their three albums of straightforward hard rock, but their contents are a long way from the innovations of Cream or Afrobeat or Stratavarious. After their split, Baker\u2019s life seemed to descend into chaos, shot through with further tales of financial mismanagement and personal turmoil. He played on Hawkwind\u2019s 1980 album Levitation \u2013 you can spot him a mile off on Space Chase and closer Dust of Time \u2013 but otherwise largely retreated from music. Producer Bill Laswell involved him in the making of Public Image Limited\u2019s acclaimed 1986 album Album and had him record an instrumental solo album, Horses and Trees, that veered from world music fusion to experiments with sampling and scratching. However, by the late 80s, Baker was reduced to placing small ads in LA music magazines, looking for work. He spent the rest of his career dividing his time between session work and a succession of intriguing, if uneven, solo projects that lurched between world music (Ginger Baker: African Force), free improvisation (Unseen Rain; No Material, a challenging collaboration with saxophonist Peter Br\u00f6tzmann and others) and jazz: Going Back Home (1994) and Coward of the County (1999) both received critical praise, underlining that, unlike most of his rock peers, Baker could cut it as a straightforward jazz drummer. A brief Cream reunion in 2005 ended unhappily. Baker and Bruce\u2019s enmity had not been dimmed by the passing of time, Bruce wryly suggesting that things might be improved if Baker moved even further away from England than his new home in South Africa. Then came Beware of Mr Baker and a series of promotional interviews for the film that did nothing to undercut the grim image projected in it. It was hard to work out whether Baker was just spectacularly embittered by his experiences in the music business, or whether he\u2019d always been a bit like that. Whatever the reason, Baker was clearly not an easy man to love, or even to like. But he was also an inspired and groundbreaking musician, a drummer other drummers queued to pay homage to, even when their praise was rebuffed. And that\u2019s what Baker should and will be remembered for. \u201cHe wanted to advance and challenge himself \u2013 isn\u2019t that what we\u2019re all doing this for?\u201d offered John Lydon, decades after the two had collaborated, noting that he was also \u201ca nutter \u2026 a monster-raging-crazy-loony\u201d. \u201cWe just gelled,\u201d he added.",

      "bodyText": "Portrush, County Antrim Northern Ireland\u2019s toned-down answer to Newquay has a cheerful holiday vibe thanks to the swarms of beginners splashing around in the waves, in contrast to the more serious nature of some of the wilder and more remote surf spots found in this part of the world \u2013 especially to the west in Donegal. Portrush offers two options, West Strand (usually bigger) and East Strand, and like the rest of the breaks along this coastline they\u2019re oriented in a generally northerly direction, which means the region\u2019s prevailing winds are offshore, creating wonderful \u201cclean\u201d waves. Lessons and board hire From \u00a330 for two hours, boards \u00a312 a day at Troggs Surf School. Where to eat Check out the surf action with coffee and cake at Babushka Kitchen Caf\u00e9 above West Strand. Where to stay Maddybenny Farm (camping from \u00a37.50 adult, under-10s \u00a35) offers quiet, family-friendly camping close to Portrush. Lewis, Outer Hebrides The isle of Lewis and Harris has some of the most consistent waves in northern Europe thanks to its exposed location on the eastern edge of the Atlantic. And because of the Gulf Stream, the water isn\u2019t as cold as you might expect (as high as 16C in the autumn). Add magnificent white sand beaches to that and if you catch it when the sun\u2019s shining on a clean swell, you\u2019ll consider the journey well worthwhile. Crowds are not an issue here and there\u2019s usually a friendly vibe in the water, but bear in mind the isolation of the breaks when surfing in more challenging conditions, or if you\u2019re inexperienced \u2013 novices should certainly be wary of going it alone. Lessons and board hire Adults from \u00a345, children from \u00a335, boards from \u00a315 a day at Surf Lewis. Where to eat The nearby Uig Sands restaurant has superb sea views and is famed for its smoked Scottish salmon.

Where to stay The family-run Trevedra Farm campsite (from \u00a37.50 adult, \u00a34 child + \u00a33.50 tent pitch) above Gwynver has marvellous coastal views.

Where to eat Try Graze Coffee &amp; Chocolate House in Dunbar \u2013 the toasted Belgian waffles with a warm chocolate shot are particularly appealing after a cold session in the North Sea. Where to stay Meadowhead\u2019s Mortonhall park has static caravans above the beach, but its campsite at nearby Belhaven Bay in the John Muir Country Park is a more attractive option (two people + tent from \u00a319.80). Saltburn, North Yorkshire This is the first place I ever surfed, and I\u2019ve been riding the waves here with Nick Noble and Gary Rogers, the affable owners of the beachside surf shop and kit hire businesses, since 1979.

Lessons and board hire \u00a330 for two hours, boards \u00a35 an hour at Saltburn Surf . Where to eat Watch the surf action with coffee and cake at the seafront Camfields Espresso Bar. Where to stay A few miles down the coast at Robin Hood\u2019s Bay (which also gets surf), Bay Ness Farm (from \u00a310 a night) has some of the best sea views in Yorkshire. Perranporth, Cornwall It can be a bit of a zoo here on a good swell (the best waves tend to occur around low tide) but with so many surfers about, the buzz is reassuring if you\u2019re a novice.

Where to stay Tollgate Farm (from \u00a35.50 adult, \u00a32.50 child + \u00a37 tent pitch) has access to Perran Sands through the dunes above the beach. Woolacombe, Devon Woolacombe is a beginner-friendly surf spot with mellow beach breaks, although it will certainly appeal to experienced surfers looking for bigger swells \u2013 especially as Croyde, the other local spot, is invariably far busier. At high tide a right breaks off the rocks at the northern end of the beach, which is what attracts experienced wave riders, and there are some decent low-tide peaks to be found in little Combesgate Beach just a bit further north.

Where to stay Hillend Caravan &amp; Camping Park (tent for family of five or up to three adults from \u00a321) above the beach is an appealing spot, but it can get very busy.

Lessons and board hire \u00a335 for three hours at The Big Blue Experience, boards from \u00a36 an hour at Newsurf. Where to eat Sands Caf\u00e9 is conveniently located near the surf school. Where to stay Newgale Campsite (\u00a38 adult, \u00a34 child) at the north end of the beach is literally seconds from the surf. Porth Neigwl, Gwynedd This is a vast stretch of sand and shingle at the southern tip of the lovely Ll\u0177n peninsula, with beach breaks along its length plus a small reef at the north-west end of the bay, which will interest more experienced surfers. The beach break peaks along the rest of the bay are ideal for beginners (I did a lot of my early wave riding here) although you\u2019ll need to watch out for rips on bigger swells \u2013 there\u2019s a healthy and talented population of experienced local surfers ready to rip when a good swell hits. Porth Neigwl is known as Hell\u2019s Mouth in English, but expect to hear Welsh being spoken out in the surf; the Ll\u0177n peninsula is a hub of Welsh culture. Lessons and board hire \u00a335 for two hours, boards \u00a310 a day at West Coast Surf Shop in Abersoch, three miles to the east. Where to eat There\u2019s nothing at the beach, but Mickey\u2019s Boatyard &amp; Beach Caf\u00e9 in Abersoch is a good post-surf option. Where to stay Treheli Farm campsite (tent pitch \u00a315) is right above the beach. Looking for a holiday with a difference? Browse Guardian Holidays to see a range of fantastic trips",

Michael Sheen? Tick. Celyn Jones? Yes, certainly sounds Welsh. Sir Anthony Hopkins? No questions asked. But what about Matthew Rhys? He\u2019s an A-lister in the US, where he won an Emmy last year, and many fans have no idea he was not raised on their side of the Atlantic.</p> <p>But Rhys, 44, who co-stars with Tom Hanks in the very American film <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/09/a-beautiful-day-in-the-neighborhood-review-tom-hanks-charms-as-mister-rogers\" title=\"\">A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood</a></em>, is in fact Cardiff born and bred. His surname is a clue, yet the actor\u2019s mastery of accents, particularly in the award-winning spy television series <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-americans\" title=\"\">The Americans</a></em>, has shaped his career, keeping him working largely in the US, where he first appeared in the popular series <em>Brothers and Sisters </em>with Sally Field and Calista Flockhart.<br>Fellow American cast members are not always happy, he told the <em>Observer</em> this weekend, when they discover he is Welsh. \u201cI do get comments like, \u2018When are you going back?\u2019 and \u2018Have you got leave to stay?\u2019 It is all done under the guise of joking about it, but they are annoyed by it.\u201d</p> <p>Despite his proud Welsh identity, Rhys is now to play a major American fictional hero: Perry Mason. The actor has been cast as the crime-busting California lawyer in a major television reboot set and filmed in Los Angeles. The HBO show will go back to the 1932 setting of the original books by Erle Stanley Gardner, rather than pick up on the 1960s setting of the vintage black and white television series, starring Raymond Burr.</p> <p>Before Mason becomes a defence lawyer, Rhys\u2019s version will show him working as a low-rent private investigator, haunted by his wartime experiences and mourning a broken marriage.</p> <p>The actor\u2019s high profile in America now suits him domestically since he lives in New York with Keri Russell, his co-star in <em>The Americans,</em> and their young son. His Welsh Bafta nomination comes, however, for his recent British television appearance with Jamie Dornan in BBC2\u2019s drama series <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/dec/12/wednesday-best-tv-death-and-nightingales-old-peoples-home-for-4-year-olds-christmas\" title=\"\">Death and Nightingales</a></em>. And he says that being professionally recognised for this in his native land means a lot to him: \u201cYou want the plaudits most from your hometown somehow. It\u2019s there you want to prove yourself, so being nominated there is the greatest accolade, especially to be alongside Sir Tony, Celyn and Sheeny. That is a really rounded category.\u201d</p> <p>The wealth of Welsh acting talent on the market at the moment suggests a ratio per head that is now beaten only by the output of Eton College. How does Rhys explain the success of such a small country?</p> <p>\u201cThere are a lot of us,\u201d he agreed. \u201cI think it is a perfect storm. For me, the inspiration was Richard Burton. I grew up watching his films and thinking, hey, there is this world-famous actor and he comes from Port Talbot! And Anthony Hopkins came next as the giant A-lister.\u201d</p> <p>Hopkins is also from the Port Talbot area, as is Sheen, but Rhys thinks the explanation lies in the culture, not the geography. \u201cI\u2019m sure I will get a rise taken out of me for this, but I think it is because of the bardic tradition and the Welsh storytelling tradition. Regardless of your schooling in Wales, you are all expected to take part in a festival, the Eisteddfod, that has poetry recital and music, as well as performance. It is not just encouraged, it is commonplace. And I love that fact. I know people who have gone on to work in business but say it really helped them with public speaking.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7eae4f21463896dac41a99af5451b5518ddeb5de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7eae4f21463896dac41a99af5451b5518ddeb5de/0_0_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matthew Rhys with Tom Hanks in A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matthew Rhys with Tom Hanks in A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lacey Terrell/CTMG</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Last November his friend Rhys Ifans, another Welsh star, was a leading <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/nov/12/more-than-200-welsh-actors-criticise-national-theatre-waless-output\" title=\"\">signatory to a letter complaining when the National Theatre of Wales </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/nov/12/more-than-200-welsh-actors-criticise-national-theatre-waless-output\" title=\"\">failed to cast Welsh actors</a>. Although Rhys himself is guilty of often playing Americans, he feels the arguments for him are different.</p> <p>\u201cIn America, I don\u2019t feel I am robbing jobs from anyone, because of the vastness of the country. There is plenty to go round. But in Wales, and in a national company, I agree that they really should be looking to Welsh actors first,\u201d he said.</p> <p><a href=\"https://wales247.co.uk/actors-rhys-ifans-and-matthew-rhys-call-on-welsh-teachers-to-make-most-of-free-film-festival/\" title=\"\">Rhys also campaigned with Ifans last month</a> to get more Welsh children inside cinemas. They both believe it is a good habit to form. \u201cWe have so many platforms now, but it still matters to have that different experience of watching a film with 100 other people at an early age, all gasping, or laughing or crying. Tarantino has been banging the drum about this recently, and we advocate it as well.\u201d</p> <p>Rhys\u2019s new film with Hanks is his second, following his role in <em>The Post</em> as the whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg. This time, in another story based on real life, Hanks portrays Fred Rogers, a well-known children\u2019s television presenter in America. Rhys plays jaded Lloyd Vogel, a character based on Tom Junod, who wrote an acclaimed piece for <em>Esquire</em> magazine which inspired the film. It tells of five days he spent with Rogers and the profound effect it had on him.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a time when journalists could still embed themselves with a subject for a while,\u201d said Rhys. \u201cJunod always felt you should be silent as an interviewer and let a personality reveal themselves, but he said he met his match in Rogers and found that he was the one opening up.\u201d</p> <p>Despite his busy Hollywood work schedule, Rhys said that he hopes to be offered a leading part in a West End play. \u201cThat would be the dream,\u201d he said. And he could play American or Welsh.</p> <p><em>The British Academy Cymru Awards will be held </em><em>in Cardiff on 13 October</em></p> <h2><strong>Other Welsh stars</strong></h2> <p><em><strong>Jonathan Pryce, 72</strong></em></p> <p><em>Born in Flintshire, the star of Brazil will soon be seen with </em><em><strong>Anthony Hopkins </strong>in The Two Popes.</em></p> <p><em><strong>Christian Bale, 45</strong></em></p> <p><em>Born in Haverfordwest, he has played both Batman and Dick Cheney.</em></p> <p><em><strong>Catherine Zeta-Jones, 50</strong></em></p> <p><em>Queen of Hollywood and Swansea Bay.</em></p> <p><em><strong>Si\u00e2n Phillips, 86</strong></em></p> <p><em>Theatre royalty, born near Neath, recently starred in the BBC\u2019s Strike.</em></p> <p><em><strong>Rhys Ifans, 52</strong></em></p> <p><em>Haverfordwest born.

The actor has been cast as the crime-busting California lawyer in a major television reboot set and filmed in Los Angeles. The HBO show will go back to the 1932 setting of the original books by Erle Stanley Gardner, rather than pick up on the 1960s setting of the vintage black and white television series, starring Raymond Burr. Before Mason becomes a defence lawyer, Rhys\u2019s version will show him working as a low-rent private investigator, haunted by his wartime experiences and mourning a broken marriage. The actor\u2019s high profile in America now suits him domestically since he lives in New York with Keri Russell, his co-star in The Americans, and their young son. His Welsh Bafta nomination comes, however, for his recent British television appearance with Jamie Dornan in BBC2\u2019s drama series Death and Nightingales. And he says that being professionally recognised for this in his native land means a lot to him: \u201cYou want the plaudits most from your hometown somehow. It\u2019s there you want to prove yourself, so being nominated there is the greatest accolade, especially to be alongside Sir Tony, Celyn and Sheeny. That is a really rounded category.\u201d The wealth of Welsh acting talent on the market at the moment suggests a ratio per head that is now beaten only by the output of Eton College. How does Rhys explain the success of such a small country? \u201cThere are a lot of us,\u201d he agreed. \u201cI think it is a perfect storm. For me, the inspiration was Richard Burton. I grew up watching his films and thinking, hey, there is this world-famous actor and he comes from Port Talbot! And Anthony Hopkins came next as the giant A-lister.\u201d Hopkins is also from the Port Talbot area, as is Sheen, but Rhys thinks the explanation lies in the culture, not the geography. \u201cI\u2019m sure I will get a rise taken out of me for this, but I think it is because of the bardic tradition and the Welsh storytelling tradition. Regardless of your schooling in Wales, you are all expected to take part in a festival, the Eisteddfod, that has poetry recital and music, as well as performance. It is not just encouraged, it is commonplace. And I love that fact. I know people who have gone on to work in business but say it really helped them with public speaking.\u201d Last November his friend Rhys Ifans, another Welsh star, was a leading signatory to a letter complaining when the National Theatre of Wales failed to cast Welsh actors. Although Rhys himself is guilty of often playing Americans, he feels the arguments for him are different. \u201cIn America, I don\u2019t feel I am robbing jobs from anyone, because of the vastness of the country. There is plenty to go round. But in Wales, and in a national company, I agree that they really should be looking to Welsh actors first,\u201d he said. Rhys also campaigned with Ifans last month to get more Welsh children inside cinemas. They both believe it is a good habit to form. \u201cWe have so many platforms now, but it still matters to have that different experience of watching a film with 100 other people at an early age, all gasping, or laughing or crying. Tarantino has been banging the drum about this recently, and we advocate it as well.\u201d Rhys\u2019s new film with Hanks is his second, following his role in The Post as the whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg. This time, in another story based on real life, Hanks portrays Fred Rogers, a well-known children\u2019s television presenter in America. Rhys plays jaded Lloyd Vogel, a character based on Tom Junod, who wrote an acclaimed piece for Esquire magazine which inspired the film. It tells of five days he spent with Rogers and the profound effect it had on him. \u201cIt was a time when journalists could still embed themselves with a subject for a while,\u201d said Rhys. \u201cJunod always felt you should be silent as an interviewer and let a personality reveal themselves, but he said he met his match in Rogers and found that he was the one opening up.\u201d Despite his busy Hollywood work schedule, Rhys said that he hopes to be offered a leading part in a West End play. \u201cThat would be the dream,\u201d he said. And he could play American or Welsh. The British Academy Cymru Awards will be held in Cardiff on 13 October Other Welsh stars Jonathan Pryce, 72 Born in Flintshire, the star of Brazil will soon be seen with Anthony Hopkins in The Two Popes. Christian Bale, 45 Born in Haverfordwest, he has played both Batman and Dick Cheney. Catherine Zeta-Jones, 50 Queen of Hollywood and Swansea Bay. Si\u00e2n Phillips, 86 Theatre royalty, born near Neath, recently starred in the BBC\u2019s Strike. Rhys Ifans, 52 Haverfordwest born. Soon to be seen as the Observer\u2019s Ed Vulliamy in Official Secrets. Ioan Gruffudd, 45 Born near Aberdare, starred in Fantastic Four.",

The idea, she says, is that the cafe \u2013called Farahway \u2013 will become a hub for ethical craft workshops, offering everything from how to make a baby\u2019s turban to tutorials on creating reusable face cloths, all with coffee and cake on the side at the same time. \u201cFor my generation especially, a lot of it is about picking up a practical new skill and hanging out with likeminded people,\u201d she says. \u201cAlso, it\u2019s just nice to make something.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Do we seek any solace or answers when we look back on the divisions of another country? For the second time this year, a major institution takes on apartheid-era South Africa: its circumstances and its legacy. The RSC recently announced that John Kani\u2019s incisive play <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/apr/07/kunene-and-the-king-rsc-stratford-john-kani-sher-review-top-girls-national-grief-thing-feathers\" title=\"\">Kunene and the King</a></em>, reflecting on his country 25 years after its first democratic election, is to transfer to the West End. In the meantime, here is a report from the heart of apartheid.</p> <p>Athol Fugard, one of the most celebrated of the era\u2019s dramatists, has described <strong><a href=\"https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/master-harold-and-the-boys\" title=\"\">\u201cMaster Harold\u201d\u2026 and the boys</a></strong>, first put on in 1982 but set in 1950, as the \u201cmost intensely personal\u201d of his works. It\u2019s a small-scale drama \u2013 three actors in one room for 90 minutes \u2013 with a long political reach, and is meticulously directed at the National by Roy Alexander Weise, who next month becomes (with Bryony Shanahan) the co-artistic director of the Royal Exchange in Manchester.</p> <p>In a tearoom in Port Elizabeth \u2013 vividly realised in Rajha Shakiry\u2019s design with a faded Coca-Cola ad and a jukebox playing You\u2019re the Cream in My Coffee \u2013 two black waiters (Hammed Animashaun and Lucian Msamati) first josh, then fondly reminisce and finally clash with the owner\u2019s white schoolboy son (a blazered Anson Boon). The first half of the evening is cumbersome, but the eventual climax \u2013 which drew gasps on press night \u2013 is skewering.</p> <p>Boon, making his stage debut, begins by appearing shrill, too emphatic in speech and grimaces \u2013 Fugard is delivering an unsparing autoportrait of white entitlement \u2013 but he comes into his own as the extent and cause of his anxiety, an anxiety that adds fuel to his brutality, is made evident. Animashaun gradually, delicately reveals how taut and watchful his apparently slow character is. Msamati is remarkable: at once sharp and generous, direct and nimble. The opening and closing moments capture the play\u2019s most original stroke. Animashaun and Msamati are seen practising the foxtrot in preparation for a ballroom dancing competition. Dancing enables them to imagine a life without their current constraints: one in which they are in control, in which there are \u201cno accidents\u201d, no collisions.

      "bodyText": "Do we seek any solace or answers when we look back on the divisions of another country? For the second time this year, a major institution takes on apartheid-era South Africa: its circumstances and its legacy. The RSC recently announced that John Kani\u2019s incisive play Kunene and the King, reflecting on his country 25 years after its first democratic election, is to transfer to the West End. In the meantime, here is a report from the heart of apartheid. Athol Fugard, one of the most celebrated of the era\u2019s dramatists, has described \u201cMaster Harold\u201d\u2026 and the boys, first put on in 1982 but set in 1950, as the \u201cmost intensely personal\u201d of his works. It\u2019s a small-scale drama \u2013 three actors in one room for 90 minutes \u2013 with a long political reach, and is meticulously directed at the National by Roy Alexander Weise, who next month becomes (with Bryony Shanahan) the co-artistic director of the Royal Exchange in Manchester. In a tearoom in Port Elizabeth \u2013 vividly realised in Rajha Shakiry\u2019s design with a faded Coca-Cola ad and a jukebox playing You\u2019re the Cream in My Coffee \u2013 two black waiters (Hammed Animashaun and Lucian Msamati) first josh, then fondly reminisce and finally clash with the owner\u2019s white schoolboy son (a blazered Anson Boon). The first half of the evening is cumbersome, but the eventual climax \u2013 which drew gasps on press night \u2013 is skewering. Boon, making his stage debut, begins by appearing shrill, too emphatic in speech and grimaces \u2013 Fugard is delivering an unsparing autoportrait of white entitlement \u2013 but he comes into his own as the extent and cause of his anxiety, an anxiety that adds fuel to his brutality, is made evident. Animashaun gradually, delicately reveals how taut and watchful his apparently slow character is. Msamati is remarkable: at once sharp and generous, direct and nimble. The opening and closing moments capture the play\u2019s most original stroke. Animashaun and Msamati are seen practising the foxtrot in preparation for a ballroom dancing competition. Dancing enables them to imagine a life without their current constraints: one in which they are in control, in which there are \u201cno accidents\u201d, no collisions. At the end, elegiacally lit by the mighty Paule Constable, they take to the floor again, twinkle-toed and unencumbered. Ya\u00ebl Farber has talked of how her South African upbringing has given intensity to her work in the theatre. Mies Julie, her sultry version of Strindberg\u2019s often performed play, which transported the action to South Africa, was one of the very few productions I have seen which made the play seem credible.

Thalissa Teixeira, a column of white, is the voice of the moon, delivering Isobel Waller-Bridge\u2019s compositions with exquisite, hypnotic strength. The elements in Farber\u2019s production are distinguished: there is an exciting symbolic horse \u2013 though he probably did not need to gallop around more than once \u2013 and strong performances, in particular by Olwen Fou\u00e9r\u00e9 as an adamantine matriarch and Aoife Duffin as an anguished bride.

      "bodyText": "Born in Dublin in 1969, Emma Donoghue studied English and French at University College Dublin, followed by a PhD in English at Cambridge University. In 1994 she published her first novel Stir Fry; her others include Slammerkin in 2000 and The Sealed Letter in 2008. Her 2010 novel Room was shortlisted for the Booker prize, and her adaptation of it for the 2015 film earned her nominations for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe and a Bafta. Her latest novel, Akin, is published by Picador. 1. Book The Secret Commonwealth by Philip Pullman This is the book I\u2019m looking forward to most. Right now I\u2019m in the middle of reading my 12-year-old (while she KonMaris her drawers) the His Dark Materials trilogy, which is the work I always recommend to adults who \u201cdon\u2019t read kids\u2019 books\u201d. I\u2019m on my third go through this epic fantasy, and I\u2019m still finding new riches in it. When I heard Pullman was bringing back his most famous character Lyra (as a baby!) in La Belle Sauvage I must admit I cringed \u2013 but the book was brilliant, so I can\u2019t wait to see what he does with an adult Lyra in The Secret Commonwealth. 2. TV Gentleman Jack In 1990, I came across Helena Whitbread\u2019s I Know My Own Heart: The Diaries of Anne Lister 1791-1840; this uniquely cocky Regency Yorkshire diarist reached out of the past and yanked me in. My first nonfiction book, Passions Between Women, was a study of things Lister could plausibly have read in forming her lesbian identity. So Gentleman Jack was a drama series I\u2019d waited nearly 30 years for, and I thought it couldn\u2019t possibly live up to my hopes, but it outdid them. Sally Wainwright\u2019s tough and witty writing, Suranne Jones\u2019s stride and wink \u2013 and Anne Lister finally finds her public, two centuries on. 3. Restaurant Les Amoureux, Nice Our family\u2019s been lucky enough to spend two separate years in Nice, and in that whole shiny city the eatery we\u2019re most nostalgic for is a tiny pizzeria, past the old port, called Les Amoureux. The owner is so firm about ingredients that he goes back to Italy weekly to buy them. Les Amoureux is up-to-date enough to serve pistachio pesto, but old-fashioned enough that only women get their pizzas served in a heart shape, and there\u2019s a metal figurine of a hunchback by the door that you rub for good luck on your way out. 4. Clothes Desigual I\u2019m no clothes-hound but there is one brand that reliably makes me smile: I\u2019m obsessed with Spanish make Desigual. I first encountered these colourfully patchworked creations (the name means \u201cuneven\u201d in Catalan) in the company\u2019s home city, Barcelona. I avoid the ones with sappy English words on them, but the rest of their exuberant pieces give me joy. At last count I had four of their dramatic long jackets and seven of their punchily patterned black, white and red shift dresses. 5. App Workflowy I couldn\u2019t live without this app, which a film director recommended at a moment in my life when I had so many plates in the air that I had a sick sense I was about to drop them all. It couldn\u2019t be simpler to use, so there\u2019s no learning-curve time. Workflowy is basically a list with other lists nested inside each item (\u201ctrip to NY spring 2020?\u201d might contain \u201cwhat plays on?\u201d, which might contain \u201ctry for tix to Hadestown\u201d). Once I\u2019ve put in a task, a confirmation number or a stray idea, I don\u2019t have to think about again. 6. Theatre A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream, Bridge theatre, London I went to this with friends who ranged in age from six to 57; it deeply gratified us all. The space allowed for the promenading crowd to be pressed into service as mobs, balloon-wranglers and dancers; those of us who prefer to sit could watch the thrilling whirl of it all.

      "body": "<p>The old voice you can conjure with your eyes closed, so for the first five minutes or so it\u2019s disconcerting to sit and talk with Billy Connolly. That familiar electric gruffness has been replaced with something kindlier and more considered. Getting used to it is a bit like watching John McEnroe play tennis on the seniors\u2019 circuit \u2013 you wait for a moment that suggests the old unique timing, and it\u2019s all the more poignant when you catch the sudden ghost of it.</p> \n<p>We met in a hotel bar on one of those baking days of summer. Connolly was over in the UK to finish the voiceovers of his<a href=\"https://www.itv.com/hub/billy-connollys-great-american-trail/2a6759a0001\" title=\"\"> latest eccentric tour of America for ITV</a>. His wife, Pamela Stephenson, accompanied him into the coolness of the bar, settled him in a corner chair and then left us to it. All day before we met I\u2019d been immersed in his new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/dec/28/billy-connolly-made-in-scotland-review-pure-gallus-from-a-folk-comedy-hero\" title=\"\">book</a>, which collects in print the wild and whirling tales that have been Connolly\u2019s stage show for the past four decades \u2013 those riffs on inflight toilets, Mairi\u2019s Wedding, incontinence knickers, the Last Supper. His collected stories. He\u2019s resisted ever writing them down, but the fact that he recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/dec/03/billy-connolly-announces-retirement-from-live-performance\" title=\"\">announced retirement</a> from the stage made it seem like the right moment. Still, he says, he can\u2019t quite bear to look at his own words on the page.</p> \n<p>If it\u2019s any consolation, I say, it reads like a talking book.</p> \n<p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d he concedes. \u201cIt\u2019s funny, I tried to write stuff down over the years, but I never could. I\u2019d end up just with things that are good on chat shows, one-liners but no stories. I even tried to write a book once. It ended up two pages long. I couldn\u2019t think of anything else to say.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>On Twitter, guys I\u2019d never set eyes on were threatening to beat the shit out of me. I thought: fuck this. It\u2019s anti-social media\u2019</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>He pauses for a moment, structuring the next thought. \u201cMind you,\u201d he says, \u201cone of the best stories I ever read had two pages. This was 50 years ago. Someone in the story had invented a way of linking up all the computers in the world and it promised to collect all knowledge and make life amazing for everybody. It fell to the president to launch it. He typed in the question \u2018Is there a God?\u2019 A few seconds went by and the answer came on the screen: \u2018Now there is\u2019.\u201d He pauses again. \u201cAnd here we are,\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>Connolly was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease six years ago, just as he reached his three score years and 10. He got the news on the same day that he was diagnosed with prostate cancer (\u201cYou\u2019re not going to die,\u201d the doctor told him. \u201cOf course I\u2019m not going to fucking die,\u201d Connolly replied. \u201cThe thought has never crossed my mind\u201d). A timely operation solved the cancer. The Parkinson\u2019s obviously hasn\u2019t gone away. At the beginning of this year he made <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0bwzhxx\" title=\"\">a film about living with the condition</a>, in which he inadvertently seemed to be saying goodbye. He subsequently had to reassure fans by putting out a short film of himself crooning with his banjo on the deck of his Florida home: \u201cNot dying, not dead, not slipping away.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e654ecac-ebd2-4e5d-aaa9-a447efd944c8\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YKDz6PQdb7M?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>I say to him it is good to see that reports of his demise were exaggerated. He looks well.</p> \n<p>\u201cI have good days and bad days,\u201d he says. \u201cShaky days. I made an arse of it on the film I made, where I said I was wasting away. But Parkinson\u2019s is like that. One day my hearing went, then my balance went, my sight got worse. It feels as if everything is being taken away from you and you watch it go. But I am on medication, so it is all going slowly.\u201d</p> \n<p>In his book, he suggests that ever-present sense of decline tends to make you pay more attention to life. Is that so?</p> \n<p>\u201cLittle changes quickly become normal,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t get out of bed, so I put my hands up like this\u201d \u2013he raises his arms \u2013 \u201cwhen I want to get up and Pam pulls me to the side of the bed. I can\u2019t get my legs over.\u201d He smiles. \u201cYour priorities change. When I walk into a room now I am scanning to see which chair I might be able to get out of. But it\u2019s not terrible.\u201d He had a doctor who told him: \u201cYou have to understand this is an incurable disease.\u201d Connolly corrected him abruptly. \u201cYou mean, this is a disease for which we have yet to find a cure.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cGive me a light in the tunnel for Christ\u2019s sake!\u201d he says. \u201cThey are making extraordinary advances. Probably not soon enough for me. But for the next generation, maybe.\u201d</p> \n<p>How easy is it to retain a sense that life is comedy rather than tragedy?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f63dde66ae8e6e655b9586a8b932da4e9cfef690\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f63dde66ae8e6e655b9586a8b932da4e9cfef690/0_0_4473_3584/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A mural of Connolly by Scottish artist Jack Vettriano in Dixon Street, Glasgow, one of three unveiled around the city in 2017 in honour of his 75th birthday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"801\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A mural of Connolly by Scottish artist Jack Vettriano in Dixon Street, Glasgow, one of three unveiled around the city in 2017 in honour of his 75th birthday.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gerard Ferry/Alamy Stock Photo</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cIt is important to hold on to that,\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be that guy in the corner with what they call Parkinson\u2019s face, looking bewildered. One symptom is a tendency to look forwards, to not look people in the eye.\u201d He catches himself. \u201cI\u2019m doing it now. I have to correct it. I have a doctor in New York, Jewish and funny, she really likes me to joke about it. The constipation, all that.\u201d He mock-grimaces. \u201cSome doctors don\u2019t, they want you to take it all seriously. But I think, WFN. Why fucking not?\u201d</p> \n<p>Is he a model patient?</p> \n<p>\u201cI fear I become a pain in the arse at times. Pamela has to sort my pillows out when I get into bed. She didn\u2019t do it right last night. And you lie there thinking: \u2018Can I really ask her to come back and do it again? Or should I put up with it?\u2019 So far, she has never tutted. And she\u2019s a rather attractive nurse.\u201d</p> \n<p>It was Stephenson who organised the move to Florida last year. They had been living in New York, but Connolly told her that his uncertain balance couldn\u2019t take another winter of snow and slippery sidewalks. Before he knew it she had found and bought the house in Key West. \u201cAnd so I went,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like in my life now, she does things and I follow.\u201d</p> \n<p>He has appreciated the move. They have a river that runs by their back door and he can fish off the deck, almost without getting out of bed.</p> \n<p>\u201cManatee come up and I give them water and lettuce,\u201d he says. \u201cThese big strange things like mermaids. We have pelicans and turkey buzzards; pterodactyls wouldn\u2019t be a surprise. People drive down to Key West for the sunset and cheer when it disappears over the horizon. Pamela and I don\u2019t cheer, but we watch it.\u201d</p> \n<p>There is an alligator catcher, a good man to know. When he catches one he brings it to Connolly\u2019s house first to show him. \u201cHis technique is to tie up its jaws and keep it in his garden, where he plays AC/DC to it night and day,\u201d he says. \u201cMotorhead would do just as well \u2013 <em>No Sleep \u2019</em><em>til Hammersmith</em>. In his experience the alligators just stay away from humans after that.\u201d</p> \n<p>Does he feel at home at that end of the earth?</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good place to live. There are a lot of people running away from regular society: cross-gender people; guys who just fish or lie on the sidewalk. There is a naked bar not far from us, I\u2019ve never been, though Pam has; I told her to choose her bar stool carefully. They are big on parades. Every Tuesday is Tutu Tuesday. It is a surreal kind of place. I like it.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"be2973d535c3da4480ad1c99078c588390e5d658\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be2973d535c3da4480ad1c99078c588390e5d658/124_0_2982_2981/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Pamela Stephenson, 1985.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Pamela Stephenson, 1985.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Fenton/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>I have met and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2001/sep/23/features.magazine67\" title=\"\">interviewed Connolly once before</a>, nearly 20 years ago. At the time he was, at Stephenson\u2019s insistence, facing up to the demons of his Glasgow childhood, what he smiled at calling his \u201cabandonment issues\u201d, enjoying the grandeur of the phrase. He had been having a lot of therapy, not least from his comedian-turned-shrink wife. She had written a book about him, with him, in which he revealed all sorts of darkness. How his mother had literally walked out on him and his sister when they were toddlers and they were apparently by themselves for some days before being discovered and reluctantly taken in by aunts. How his father, not long home from the war, often drunk, had \u201cinterfered with him\u201d, abused him over a period of years, experiences that had, he had come to understand, fuelled his own alcoholism. At the time we spoke, he had long been sober but seemed quite high on Californian introspection. Watching him on TV in recent years, I suggest he seems to have parked that phase, moved on from it.</p> \n<p>\u201cI did,\u201d he says. \u201cI have got rid of it all. The thing therapy can teach you is you have to employ forgiveness in life. After my father\u2019s death, I thought all the bad stuff would go away, but actually it all came rushing back and dominated my thoughts. And I realised I had to take it all on directly.\u201d</p> \n<p>Stephenson \u2013 with whom he has three daughters, as well as a son and daughter from his first marriage \u2013 was obviously a gift in that regard: a blast of up-front Aussie courage to uncover all that was buried under layers of tight-lipped Scottishness and maleness and old-school Clydeside welder\u2019s banter. She also insisted Connolly had to move forward. \u201cThat kind of past is like a big rucksack full of bricks,\u201d he says now. \u201cYou can lug it around all your life if you like. Or you can find a way to put it down and walk away.\u201d</p> \n<p>He refused to see himself as a victim. \u201cI see people on daytime talk shows, and there is a line underneath saying how sexual abuse or whatever has ruined their life. I think it\u2019s a crime to say that of someone. It makes them a victim of something they are totally innocent of. I don\u2019t dwell on any of that in my past now. I don\u2019t do therapy any more, because I don\u2019t feel I need it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Part of the way out of for him was Buddhist meditation. I remember him joking to me the last time we met about how he had recently experienced the ultimate Hollywood moment: Shirley MacLaine had come up to him at a party to whisper how \u201ccentred\u201d he looked. Has he kept his practice up?</p> \n<p>\u201cAye,\u201d he says, with a beatific smile. \u201cThe mindfulness of breathing. I do it every morning, just to get me squared up.\u201d He catches some of the old Govan cadence. \u201cIt is dead easy. You just breathe and make yourself aware of breathing.\u201d He likes the fact it is called \u201cJust Sitting\u201d. \u201cLoosen your trousers, untie your shoes and just sit with your eyes closed for 10 minutes or so. Open the window a wee bit, so you can hear a few noises.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d82d82f4e24325d86eaafddcf3d046687cc2797f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d82d82f4e24325d86eaafddcf3d046687cc2797f/0_269_5081_3049/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Billy Connolly with Kenny Everett and Freddie Mercury at the latter\u2019s 38th birthday party, Xenon nightclub, 1984.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Connolly with Kenny Everett and Freddie Mercury at the latter\u2019s 38th birthday party, Xenon nightclub, 1984.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Hogan/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Does it help him with the Parkinson\u2019s?</p> \n<p>\u201cIt does. Mostly it helps you to not be afraid of yourself. Quiets the voices in your head. And I have plenty of them. Good ones and bad ones, just like everyone else.\u201d</p> \n<p>What was the happiest time of his life? I wonder.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is all just about now. But getting famous was good. It was like going up a helter-skelter backwards. You know, the first time I had a sell-out at the London Palladium? That\u2019s very exciting. Particularly when you are on your own out there, I think, and it is your own material. You have created this thing and people like it. That was a lovely thing. But being famous gets wearing, though you learn to live with it.\u201d</p> \n<p>He is famous in America as much for his film acting as his comedy. I wonder when was the last time he walked into a room and no one recognised him?</p> \n<p>\u201cA long time ago. But it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p> \n<p>I mention something I remember Tom Waits saying to me on this subject once, in an interview, how \u201cthe odd thing about this life is that you spend half your time trying to get people to listen to you and the rest of the time trying to get them to leave you the fuck alone\u2026\u201d</p> \n<p>He laughs. \u201cTom came to see me a few times in San Francisco,\u201d he says, \u201cand he brought his sons along to a show. He called me afterwards to say that he\u2019d had to pull the car over on the way home, and tell his boys that they shouldn\u2019t say \u2018cunt\u2019 in front of their mother when they got home.\u201d He adopts a guttural Waits voice: \u201c\u2018Just because Billy Connolly said it, that doesn\u2019t make it right.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>It would be fair to say he has never tired of the joys of invective. \u201cI have two grandchildren, 18 and 13 now,\u201d he says. \u201cI used to love it when they were wee and had exercises at school and you\u2019d to talk about your granddad. Wally wrote \u2018My granddad has a purple beard and he plays the banjo and he squares [sic] all the time and he also has a big knife \u2013 a dirk \u2013 which he lets me play with.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>When he talks about his family the wattage of his attention brightens. \u201cMy eldest daughter <a href=\"http://www.hopscotchfilms.co.uk/scottishshorts/2014/11/19/exchange-and-mart-wins-best-british-short\" title=\"\">makes films</a>. She won a prize at Sundance recently. My son Jamie is nearly 50. He and I fish together. He\u2019s brilliant, better than me.\u201d</p> \n<p>In his book he writes movingly about how all fathers should go fishing with their sons; unlike with football there is not much action to fill the silence. \u201cYou have to talk, you are away for hours, days. And you have to talk to each other. About real things.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6975fc9c635460702a9ff525c994566cbc92b91e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6975fc9c635460702a9ff525c994566cbc92b91e/0_26_4144_2486/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Connolly at the height of his standup fame in the 1980s.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Connolly at the height of his standup fame in the 1980s.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Photoshot/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Having not had much example of that himself he has been determined to be better at it. The kids are scattered all over now, New York, Glasgow, Los Angeles. There is a family rule to Whatsapp each other pictures of dinner if they are in a restaurant. \u201cThere is no Indian restaurant in Key West,\u201d Connolly says, \u201cso they will send me pictures of curries: \u2018Eat your heart out\u2019.\u201d</p> \n<p>Beyond those pictures Connolly\u2019s relationship with social media is \u201cdeliberately sparse\u201d. He has a phone and he can do email. He doesn\u2019t know what Facebook does. He went on Twitter once when he was doing a play with Eric Idle and they were invited to create accounts to promote it. It was like the whole world turned into the Scottish tabloid press.</p> \n<p>\u201cStraight away, people just started attacking me, challenging me to a fight. Guys I\u2019d never set eyes on saying they would beat the shit out of me. I thought \u2018Fuck this\u2019. It was like being in jail.\u201d He erased it sharpish. \u201cIt\u2019s anti-social media,\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>He doesn\u2019t see that many \u201cshow business\u201d friends these days, he says, though if singers and songwriters he likes \u2013 John Sebastian, Arlo Guthrie \u2013 are in Florida he will make an effort to go. When he watches people up on stage does he still have a yearning to be up there too, in his element?</p> \n<p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t miss it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was great, but life without it is just dandy. Jamie and I were away fishing in Utah a couple of weeks ago. The Green River. We got to know all the guides, and we\u2019d go for dinner with them. A couple of times, I just sort of took over and told funny stories, and it felt great, and they were all roaring with laughter, Jamie too. It was a lovely feeling. Just letting it roll like that again. But no, I don\u2019t miss touring.\u201d</p> \n<p>He doesn\u2019t watch much comedy, he says. He always feared he would subconsciously steal stuff and old habits die hard. His heroes are musicians not funny men. \u201cHank Williams and Bob Dylan are the two,\u201d he says. He has met Dylan a few times, \u201cthough each time I have to be reintroduced to him, then we are like best buddies by the end of the evening.\u201d It was when he heard Dylan say he loved Hank Williams, too, that he knew that \u201cthere was a God\u201d. Connolly, of course, started out as a singer and banjo player in folk clubs, and \u201cfolkies always wanted to look down on country and western music \u2013 but not me.\u201d</p> \n<p>Does he remember the first time he heard Hank Williams?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c78bc3310e2441f5a7c5295923370ad8c00cbbd\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c78bc3310e2441f5a7c5295923370ad8c00cbbd/0_0_6104_4167/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Connolly with Gerry Rafferty, his partner in the folk duo the Humblebums, in 1967.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"683\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Connolly with Gerry Rafferty, his partner in the folk duo the Humblebums, in 1967.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Shuel/Redferns</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>He thinks and a smile spreads across his face. \u201cI do,\u201d he says. \u201cMy father had bought a record called Dear Mary, by Slim Whitman, at the Barrowland market in Glasgow. He thought it was a hymn, I think, but it was a country song,\u201d He sings a couple of bars in a mournful falsetto: \u201cI am writing this letter Dear Mary\u2026\u201d \u201cI loved it and my dad went back to the market and asked if they had anything else like that. The guy gave him Hank Williams, Long Gone Lonesome Blues. That was the start.\u201d</p> \n<p>One of the highlights of his latest TV travels in America was to pitch up in Alabama and hold Hank Williams\u2019s guitar. He laughs. \u201cI sat there with this wonderful thing, and everyone watching, and of course my mind went blank and I couldn\u2019t think of a single fucking Hank Williams song.\u201d</p> \n<p>The theme of that series was going to be Scots in America, \u201ctalking to witches and so on\u201d but it didn\u2019t quite work out like that. I wonder if he had planned to do anything on President Trump\u2019s mother, that bouffant \u00e9migr\u00e9 from the Isle of Lewis.</p> \n<p>\u201cNo, we kept away from all that madness,\u201d he says, stiffening. \u201cTalk about Trump, though, look who you\u2019ve got now over here: fucking soft boy.\u201d It\u2019s a relief to be a few thousand miles away from Brexit, he says. \u201cWhat a con, and the prime minister was the biggest con of all. I saw on American TV people being interviewed in south Wales, and how pleased they were to have voted out of Europe. And then they showed all the things that the EU had funded in their town. They had no idea. It\u2019s completely nuts.\u201d</p> \n<p>Connolly has a foot in Europe with a house on the island of Gozo, off Malta, which he bought after his manager, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/22/steve-brown-obituary\" title=\"\">Steve Brown</a>, moved there. Brown died in 2017. He still goes when he can. \u201cWe have an old school house. They are lovely people. There are a few Brits there too, mostly moaning about how Britain is full of immigrants\u2026\u201d</p> \n<p>He himself has lived away from Scotland, in the States, for a long time now. Is he the kind of expat who needs to have bits of home with him?</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK,\u201d he says. \u201cThe local supermarket has Irn Bru and Tunnock\u2019s caramel wafers.\u201d He is going up to Glasgow after our interview. \u201cI mostly look forward to the curry these days,\u201d he says, \u201cMother India on Sauchiehall Street. You get a lot of Mexican food in Florida, which always seems to be more about folding than eating.\u201d</p> \n<p>Now this book is out, I ask if he has any plans to write a proper memoir.</p> \n<p>He admits to \u201cticking the idea\u201d but that \u201cthere\u2019s plenty of other things to do. I\u2019d like to write songs again. I like to draw.\u201d He pauses, and seems a bit weary suddenly. \u201cLife is a bowl of cherries,\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>Does he have gloomy moments?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1ee744c2863876e3b7bddfda6b8fabfd8838f079\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ee744c2863876e3b7bddfda6b8fabfd8838f079/1430_0_4318_5396/800.jpg\" alt=\"Billy Connolly\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018When the sun goes down each night, I\u2019m pretty content.\u2019</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amit Lennon/The Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cI do.

If you change the word happy to content, that\u2019s more what I\u2019m after. When the sun goes down each night, I\u2019m pretty content,\u201d he says, and pauses. \u201cMind you I sleep like a wild animal these days. Laughing and singing, or having fights. Pamela has to sleep in another bed.\u201d</p> \n<p>He thinks those disturbed nights are probably to do with the Parkinson\u2019s or the medication. But he seems to me for the most part, I say, to be going on pretty well.</p> \n<p>\u201cI am, and then I\u2019m not. A shudder comes over me and I can\u2019t get my money back in my wallet or whatever.\u201d The compensation, he says, is that it brings out the best in people he meets. \u201cIf you say \u2018I can\u2019t get up, could you help me out of my chair please?\u2019 no one ever says \u2018Why?\u2019 They just do it. Maybe it\u2019s just me but I live in this magical life.\u201d</p> \n<p>I suggest that he has worked pretty hard for that over the years.</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about that,\u201d he says, and pauses a final time. \u201cI walk down the street and people shout: \u2018Hey Billy, how\u2019s it going?\u2019 It\u2019s great,\u201d he says. \u201cI always get the best of people: when they walk toward me they are already smiling.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Tall Tales and Wee Stories </em>is published by John Murray Press (\u00a320).

      "bodyText": "The old voice you can conjure with your eyes closed, so for the first five minutes or so it\u2019s disconcerting to sit and talk with Billy Connolly. That familiar electric gruffness has been replaced with something kindlier and more considered. Getting used to it is a bit like watching John McEnroe play tennis on the seniors\u2019 circuit \u2013 you wait for a moment that suggests the old unique timing, and it\u2019s all the more poignant when you catch the sudden ghost of it. We met in a hotel bar on one of those baking days of summer. Connolly was over in the UK to finish the voiceovers of his latest eccentric tour of America for ITV. His wife, Pamela Stephenson, accompanied him into the coolness of the bar, settled him in a corner chair and then left us to it. All day before we met I\u2019d been immersed in his new book, which collects in print the wild and whirling tales that have been Connolly\u2019s stage show for the past four decades \u2013 those riffs on inflight toilets, Mairi\u2019s Wedding, incontinence knickers, the Last Supper. His collected stories. He\u2019s resisted ever writing them down, but the fact that he recently announced retirement from the stage made it seem like the right moment. Still, he says, he can\u2019t quite bear to look at his own words on the page. If it\u2019s any consolation, I say, it reads like a talking book. \u201cI hope so,\u201d he concedes. \u201cIt\u2019s funny, I tried to write stuff down over the years, but I never could. I\u2019d end up just with things that are good on chat shows, one-liners but no stories. I even tried to write a book once. It ended up two pages long. I couldn\u2019t think of anything else to say.\u201d He pauses for a moment, structuring the next thought. \u201cMind you,\u201d he says, \u201cone of the best stories I ever read had two pages. This was 50 years ago. Someone in the story had invented a way of linking up all the computers in the world and it promised to collect all knowledge and make life amazing for everybody. It fell to the president to launch it. He typed in the question \u2018Is there a God?\u2019 A few seconds went by and the answer came on the screen: \u2018Now there is\u2019.\u201d He pauses again. \u201cAnd here we are,\u201d he says. Connolly was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease six years ago, just as he reached his three score years and 10. He got the news on the same day that he was diagnosed with prostate cancer (\u201cYou\u2019re not going to die,\u201d the doctor told him. \u201cOf course I\u2019m not going to fucking die,\u201d Connolly replied. \u201cThe thought has never crossed my mind\u201d). A timely operation solved the cancer. The Parkinson\u2019s obviously hasn\u2019t gone away. At the beginning of this year he made a film about living with the condition, in which he inadvertently seemed to be saying goodbye. He subsequently had to reassure fans by putting out a short film of himself crooning with his banjo on the deck of his Florida home: \u201cNot dying, not dead, not slipping away.\u201d I say to him it is good to see that reports of his demise were exaggerated. He looks well. \u201cI have good days and bad days,\u201d he says. \u201cShaky days. I made an arse of it on the film I made, where I said I was wasting away. But Parkinson\u2019s is like that. One day my hearing went, then my balance went, my sight got worse. It feels as if everything is being taken away from you and you watch it go. But I am on medication, so it is all going slowly.\u201d In his book, he suggests that ever-present sense of decline tends to make you pay more attention to life. Is that so? \u201cLittle changes quickly become normal,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t get out of bed, so I put my hands up like this\u201d \u2013he raises his arms \u2013 \u201cwhen I want to get up and Pam pulls me to the side of the bed. I can\u2019t get my legs over.\u201d He smiles. \u201cYour priorities change. When I walk into a room now I am scanning to see which chair I might be able to get out of. But it\u2019s not terrible.\u201d He had a doctor who told him: \u201cYou have to understand this is an incurable disease.\u201d Connolly corrected him abruptly. \u201cYou mean, this is a disease for which we have yet to find a cure.\u201d \u201cGive me a light in the tunnel for Christ\u2019s sake!\u201d he says. \u201cThey are making extraordinary advances. Probably not soon enough for me. But for the next generation, maybe.\u201d How easy is it to retain a sense that life is comedy rather than tragedy? \u201cIt is important to hold on to that,\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be that guy in the corner with what they call Parkinson\u2019s face, looking bewildered. One symptom is a tendency to look forwards, to not look people in the eye.\u201d He catches himself. \u201cI\u2019m doing it now. I have to correct it. I have a doctor in New York, Jewish and funny, she really likes me to joke about it. The constipation, all that.\u201d He mock-grimaces. \u201cSome doctors don\u2019t, they want you to take it all seriously. But I think, WFN. Why fucking not?\u201d Is he a model patient? \u201cI fear I become a pain in the arse at times. Pamela has to sort my pillows out when I get into bed. She didn\u2019t do it right last night. And you lie there thinking: \u2018Can I really ask her to come back and do it again? Or should I put up with it?\u2019 So far, she has never tutted. And she\u2019s a rather attractive nurse.\u201d It was Stephenson who organised the move to Florida last year. They had been living in New York, but Connolly told her that his uncertain balance couldn\u2019t take another winter of snow and slippery sidewalks. Before he knew it she had found and bought the house in Key West. \u201cAnd so I went,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like in my life now, she does things and I follow.\u201d He has appreciated the move. They have a river that runs by their back door and he can fish off the deck, almost without getting out of bed. \u201cManatee come up and I give them water and lettuce,\u201d he says. \u201cThese big strange things like mermaids. We have pelicans and turkey buzzards; pterodactyls wouldn\u2019t be a surprise. People drive down to Key West for the sunset and cheer when it disappears over the horizon. Pamela and I don\u2019t cheer, but we watch it.\u201d There is an alligator catcher, a good man to know. When he catches one he brings it to Connolly\u2019s house first to show him. \u201cHis technique is to tie up its jaws and keep it in his garden, where he plays AC/DC to it night and day,\u201d he says. \u201cMotorhead would do just as well \u2013 No Sleep \u2019til Hammersmith. In his experience the alligators just stay away from humans after that.\u201d Does he feel at home at that end of the earth? \u201cIt\u2019s a good place to live. There are a lot of people running away from regular society: cross-gender people; guys who just fish or lie on the sidewalk. There is a naked bar not far from us, I\u2019ve never been, though Pam has; I told her to choose her bar stool carefully. They are big on parades. Every Tuesday is Tutu Tuesday. It is a surreal kind of place. I like it.\u201d I have met and interviewed Connolly once before, nearly 20 years ago. At the time he was, at Stephenson\u2019s insistence, facing up to the demons of his Glasgow childhood, what he smiled at calling his \u201cabandonment issues\u201d, enjoying the grandeur of the phrase. He had been having a lot of therapy, not least from his comedian-turned-shrink wife. She had written a book about him, with him, in which he revealed all sorts of darkness. How his mother had literally walked out on him and his sister when they were toddlers and they were apparently by themselves for some days before being discovered and reluctantly taken in by aunts. How his father, not long home from the war, often drunk, had \u201cinterfered with him\u201d, abused him over a period of years, experiences that had, he had come to understand, fuelled his own alcoholism. At the time we spoke, he had long been sober but seemed quite high on Californian introspection. Watching him on TV in recent years, I suggest he seems to have parked that phase, moved on from it. \u201cI did,\u201d he says. \u201cI have got rid of it all. The thing therapy can teach you is you have to employ forgiveness in life. After my father\u2019s death, I thought all the bad stuff would go away, but actually it all came rushing back and dominated my thoughts. And I realised I had to take it all on directly.\u201d Stephenson \u2013 with whom he has three daughters, as well as a son and daughter from his first marriage \u2013 was obviously a gift in that regard: a blast of up-front Aussie courage to uncover all that was buried under layers of tight-lipped Scottishness and maleness and old-school Clydeside welder\u2019s banter. She also insisted Connolly had to move forward. \u201cThat kind of past is like a big rucksack full of bricks,\u201d he says now. \u201cYou can lug it around all your life if you like. Or you can find a way to put it down and walk away.\u201d He refused to see himself as a victim. \u201cI see people on daytime talk shows, and there is a line underneath saying how sexual abuse or whatever has ruined their life. I think it\u2019s a crime to say that of someone. It makes them a victim of something they are totally innocent of. I don\u2019t dwell on any of that in my past now. I don\u2019t do therapy any more, because I don\u2019t feel I need it.\u201d Part of the way out of for him was Buddhist meditation. I remember him joking to me the last time we met about how he had recently experienced the ultimate Hollywood moment: Shirley MacLaine had come up to him at a party to whisper how \u201ccentred\u201d he looked. Has he kept his practice up? \u201cAye,\u201d he says, with a beatific smile. \u201cThe mindfulness of breathing. I do it every morning, just to get me squared up.\u201d He catches some of the old Govan cadence. \u201cIt is dead easy. You just breathe and make yourself aware of breathing.\u201d He likes the fact it is called \u201cJust Sitting\u201d. \u201cLoosen your trousers, untie your shoes and just sit with your eyes closed for 10 minutes or so. Open the window a wee bit, so you can hear a few noises.\u201d Does it help him with the Parkinson\u2019s? \u201cIt does. Mostly it helps you to not be afraid of yourself. Quiets the voices in your head. And I have plenty of them. Good ones and bad ones, just like everyone else.\u201d What was the happiest time of his life? I wonder. \u201cIt is all just about now. But getting famous was good. It was like going up a helter-skelter backwards. You know, the first time I had a sell-out at the London Palladium? That\u2019s very exciting. Particularly when you are on your own out there, I think, and it is your own material. You have created this thing and people like it. That was a lovely thing. But being famous gets wearing, though you learn to live with it.\u201d He is famous in America as much for his film acting as his comedy. I wonder when was the last time he walked into a room and no one recognised him? \u201cA long time ago. But it\u2019s fine.\u201d I mention something I remember Tom Waits saying to me on this subject once, in an interview, how \u201cthe odd thing about this life is that you spend half your time trying to get people to listen to you and the rest of the time trying to get them to leave you the fuck alone\u2026\u201d He laughs. \u201cTom came to see me a few times in San Francisco,\u201d he says, \u201cand he brought his sons along to a show. He called me afterwards to say that he\u2019d had to pull the car over on the way home, and tell his boys that they shouldn\u2019t say \u2018cunt\u2019 in front of their mother when they got home.\u201d He adopts a guttural Waits voice: \u201c\u2018Just because Billy Connolly said it, that doesn\u2019t make it right.\u2019\u201d It would be fair to say he has never tired of the joys of invective. \u201cI have two grandchildren, 18 and 13 now,\u201d he says. \u201cI used to love it when they were wee and had exercises at school and you\u2019d to talk about your granddad. Wally wrote \u2018My granddad has a purple beard and he plays the banjo and he squares [sic] all the time and he also has a big knife \u2013 a dirk \u2013 which he lets me play with.\u2019\u201d When he talks about his family the wattage of his attention brightens. \u201cMy eldest daughter makes films. She won a prize at Sundance recently. My son Jamie is nearly 50. He and I fish together. He\u2019s brilliant, better than me.\u201d In his book he writes movingly about how all fathers should go fishing with their sons; unlike with football there is not much action to fill the silence. \u201cYou have to talk, you are away for hours, days. And you have to talk to each other. About real things.\u201d Having not had much example of that himself he has been determined to be better at it. The kids are scattered all over now, New York, Glasgow, Los Angeles. There is a family rule to Whatsapp each other pictures of dinner if they are in a restaurant. \u201cThere is no Indian restaurant in Key West,\u201d Connolly says, \u201cso they will send me pictures of curries: \u2018Eat your heart out\u2019.\u201d Beyond those pictures Connolly\u2019s relationship with social media is \u201cdeliberately sparse\u201d. He has a phone and he can do email. He doesn\u2019t know what Facebook does. He went on Twitter once when he was doing a play with Eric Idle and they were invited to create accounts to promote it. It was like the whole world turned into the Scottish tabloid press. \u201cStraight away, people just started attacking me, challenging me to a fight. Guys I\u2019d never set eyes on saying they would beat the shit out of me. I thought \u2018Fuck this\u2019. It was like being in jail.\u201d He erased it sharpish. \u201cIt\u2019s anti-social media,\u201d he says. He doesn\u2019t see that many \u201cshow business\u201d friends these days, he says, though if singers and songwriters he likes \u2013 John Sebastian, Arlo Guthrie \u2013 are in Florida he will make an effort to go. When he watches people up on stage does he still have a yearning to be up there too, in his element? \u201cNo, I don\u2019t miss it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was great, but life without it is just dandy. Jamie and I were away fishing in Utah a couple of weeks ago. The Green River. We got to know all the guides, and we\u2019d go for dinner with them. A couple of times, I just sort of took over and told funny stories, and it felt great, and they were all roaring with laughter, Jamie too. It was a lovely feeling. Just letting it roll like that again. But no, I don\u2019t miss touring.\u201d He doesn\u2019t watch much comedy, he says. He always feared he would subconsciously steal stuff and old habits die hard. His heroes are musicians not funny men. \u201cHank Williams and Bob Dylan are the two,\u201d he says. He has met Dylan a few times, \u201cthough each time I have to be reintroduced to him, then we are like best buddies by the end of the evening.\u201d It was when he heard Dylan say he loved Hank Williams, too, that he knew that \u201cthere was a God\u201d. Connolly, of course, started out as a singer and banjo player in folk clubs, and \u201cfolkies always wanted to look down on country and western music \u2013 but not me.\u201d Does he remember the first time he heard Hank Williams? He thinks and a smile spreads across his face. \u201cI do,\u201d he says. \u201cMy father had bought a record called Dear Mary, by Slim Whitman, at the Barrowland market in Glasgow. He thought it was a hymn, I think, but it was a country song,\u201d He sings a couple of bars in a mournful falsetto: \u201cI am writing this letter Dear Mary\u2026\u201d \u201cI loved it and my dad went back to the market and asked if they had anything else like that. The guy gave him Hank Williams, Long Gone Lonesome Blues. That was the start.\u201d One of the highlights of his latest TV travels in America was to pitch up in Alabama and hold Hank Williams\u2019s guitar. He laughs. \u201cI sat there with this wonderful thing, and everyone watching, and of course my mind went blank and I couldn\u2019t think of a single fucking Hank Williams song.\u201d The theme of that series was going to be Scots in America, \u201ctalking to witches and so on\u201d but it didn\u2019t quite work out like that. I wonder if he had planned to do anything on President Trump\u2019s mother, that bouffant \u00e9migr\u00e9 from the Isle of Lewis. \u201cNo, we kept away from all that madness,\u201d he says, stiffening. \u201cTalk about Trump, though, look who you\u2019ve got now over here: fucking soft boy.\u201d It\u2019s a relief to be a few thousand miles away from Brexit, he says. \u201cWhat a con, and the prime minister was the biggest con of all. I saw on American TV people being interviewed in south Wales, and how pleased they were to have voted out of Europe. And then they showed all the things that the EU had funded in their town. They had no idea. It\u2019s completely nuts.\u201d Connolly has a foot in Europe with a house on the island of Gozo, off Malta, which he bought after his manager, Steve Brown, moved there. Brown died in 2017. He still goes when he can. \u201cWe have an old school house. They are lovely people. There are a few Brits there too, mostly moaning about how Britain is full of immigrants\u2026\u201d He himself has lived away from Scotland, in the States, for a long time now. Is he the kind of expat who needs to have bits of home with him? \u201cIt\u2019s OK,\u201d he says. \u201cThe local supermarket has Irn Bru and Tunnock\u2019s caramel wafers.\u201d He is going up to Glasgow after our interview. \u201cI mostly look forward to the curry these days,\u201d he says, \u201cMother India on Sauchiehall Street. You get a lot of Mexican food in Florida, which always seems to be more about folding than eating.\u201d Now this book is out, I ask if he has any plans to write a proper memoir. He admits to \u201cticking the idea\u201d but that \u201cthere\u2019s plenty of other things to do. I\u2019d like to write songs again. I like to draw.\u201d He pauses, and seems a bit weary suddenly. \u201cLife is a bowl of cherries,\u201d he says. Does he have gloomy moments? \u201cI do. I sometimes try to visualise what is going to happen to me and then I have to work hard at coming out of it.\u201d What is the best strategy for that? \u201cIt usually ends up with me saying: \u2018Billy, you are 76 years old, how the fuck did you imagine you were going to feel?\u2019\u201d He thinks again about the question I asked earlier, about happiness. \u201cPeople think you have to be happy, you know the sun shining and the beach ball and \u2018ha ha ha\u2019, but I\u2019ve never been like that. If you change the word happy to content, that\u2019s more what I\u2019m after. When the sun goes down each night, I\u2019m pretty content,\u201d he says, and pauses. \u201cMind you I sleep like a wild animal these days. Laughing and singing, or having fights. Pamela has to sleep in another bed.\u201d He thinks those disturbed nights are probably to do with the Parkinson\u2019s or the medication. But he seems to me for the most part, I say, to be going on pretty well. \u201cI am, and then I\u2019m not. A shudder comes over me and I can\u2019t get my money back in my wallet or whatever.\u201d The compensation, he says, is that it brings out the best in people he meets. \u201cIf you say \u2018I can\u2019t get up, could you help me out of my chair please?\u2019 no one ever says \u2018Why?\u2019 They just do it. Maybe it\u2019s just me but I live in this magical life.\u201d I suggest that he has worked pretty hard for that over the years. \u201cI don\u2019t know about that,\u201d he says, and pauses a final time. \u201cI walk down the street and people shout: \u2018Hey Billy, how\u2019s it going?\u2019 It\u2019s great,\u201d he says. \u201cI always get the best of people: when they walk toward me they are already smiling.\u201d \u2022 Tall Tales and Wee Stories is published by John Murray Press (\u00a320).

Or perhaps it was a blast of what is to come in a no-deal crash-out, or a deal negotiated in the next few weeks or after a general election. The uncertainty was head spinning.</p> <p>Jonathan Powell, Britain\u2019s chief negotiator in Northern Ireland from 1997 to 2007, struck an ominous tone. \u201cBe under no misapprehension, there will have to be checks and there will be a hard border which will undermine the basis on which the Good Friday agreement was built in trying to find a way of dealing peacefully with the different identities of the different communities in Northern Ireland,\u201d he wrote in the <em>Belfast Telegraph</em>.</p> <p>\u201cBut the danger I fear for Northern Ireland is that it becomes the mouse as the two elephants \u2013 the EU and the British government \u2013 mate, and it is Northern Ireland that will lose out in any agreement they reach with very dangerous long-term consequences.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7c7106d5666d095a082dc707126b184e062f8535\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c7106d5666d095a082dc707126b184e062f8535/1051_0_2399_2999/800.jpg\" alt=\"Jonathan Powell, former chief British negotiator on Northern Ireland\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jonathan Powell, former chief British negotiator on Northern Ireland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Ramos/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 310-mile border, drawn in 1922 during the partition of Ireland, bristled with military patrols and fortifications during the Troubles. The 1998 Good Friday agreement and the EU\u2019s single market rendered it invisible, helping to seal the peace.</p> <p>In Gortmullan \u2013 a patchwork of farms, bungalows and hedgerows \u2013 there are no road markings to indicate the frontier. Jack McGann, 16, who works at a service station just inside the Irish border, hesitated when asked to identify where the UK began. \u201cI\u2019m not 100% sure. I think it\u2019s over there by the shed, the line goes along the middle of it,\u201d he said, pointing at a derelict structure with a tin roof abutting a road. There are about 300 other border crossings.</p> <p>McGann has never known customs checks, army searches or terrorist attacks. \u201cMy parents told me stories about the hard border. I heard it was tough.\u201d</p> <p>Eugene McAffrey, who worked at an adjacent service station just inside Northern Ireland, sighed at the mention of Brexit. \u201cIt\u2019s occupying the mind of everyone that walks in here. How could it not?\u201d</p> <p>In a pub at Derrylin, a few miles up the road, Shane McBrien, a painter, seethed at the Democratic Unionist party for endorsing Johnson\u2019s plan. \u201cAny physical border will bring back bad memories. It\u2019s just going backwards.\u201d</p> <p>His brother, Eugene, said a hard border would compound the fact that Brexit ignored the will of most Northern Ireland voters. \u201cThe north voted to remain. We\u2019re being tossed out of the EU. We\u2019ve no say.\u201d</p> <p>Applications for Irish passports from Britain and especially Northern Ireland <a href=\"https://www.irishpost.com/news/irish-passport-applications-uk-skyrocket-brexit-deadline-looming-172098\" title=\"\">continue to surge</a>, reaching 85,517 by the end of August, outpacing the 79,513 for all of 2018, according to figures released last week.</p> <p>A complex web connects the economies on both sides of the border. Trade in goods is worth about \u00a35.2bn. About a third of Northern Ireland\u2019s goods and services exports are sold to the Republic, while about a quarter of its imports come from the south.</p> <p>Downing Street says electronic paperwork and a \u201cvery small number\u201d of physical inspections at traders\u2019 premises would limit disruption. Farmers and business leaders dispute that. Some warn of disaster.</p> <p>Diageo, which makes Guinness and Baileys, estimates a hard border <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/02/boris-johnson-brexit-plan-risks-damaging-northern-ireland-economy\" title=\"\">could cost it \u00a31.3m</a>, based on an estimate of an hour\u2019s delay for each of the 18,000 beer trucks that traverse the border each year. Smaller businesses with tight margins could face ruin. \u201cMy business and family need flexibility,\u201d said Gerard Crowe, a butcher in Ballyconnell, inside the Republic. \u201cBut what\u2019s coming won\u2019t give flexibility. We\u2019ve been through all that before and we don\u2019t want it back.\u201d</p> <p>Dissident republicans have hailed Brexit \u2013 and specifically the prospect of a hard border \u2013 as a historic opportunity to revive an armed campaign. Public support for that seems negligible and attacks remain sporadic.</p> <p>But even before Johnson unveiled his plan there was a sense of the police battening down the hatches. Last Monday Irish police established a new armed support unit in Cavan, which borders Fermanagh, to combat a surge in criminality and to prepare for Brexit.</p> <p>The Police Service of Northern Ireland is planning to deploy hundreds of officers on Brexit-related operations and wants \u00a340m to recruit 300 additional officers. Simon Byrne, the PSNI chief constable, said he told the prime minister in a recent video call that his officers will <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-49925239\" title=\"\">not police any customs checkpoints</a> or \u201cbe dragged\u201d into another type of policing. A bold assertion. Northern Ireland\u2019s history shows a hard border exerts a powerful drag.</p>",

Or perhaps it was a blast of what is to come in a no-deal crash-out, or a deal negotiated in the next few weeks or after a general election. The uncertainty was head spinning. Jonathan Powell, Britain\u2019s chief negotiator in Northern Ireland from 1997 to 2007, struck an ominous tone. \u201cBe under no misapprehension, there will have to be checks and there will be a hard border which will undermine the basis on which the Good Friday agreement was built in trying to find a way of dealing peacefully with the different identities of the different communities in Northern Ireland,\u201d he wrote in the Belfast Telegraph. \u201cBut the danger I fear for Northern Ireland is that it becomes the mouse as the two elephants \u2013 the EU and the British government \u2013 mate, and it is Northern Ireland that will lose out in any agreement they reach with very dangerous long-term consequences.\u201d The 310-mile border, drawn in 1922 during the partition of Ireland, bristled with military patrols and fortifications during the Troubles. The 1998 Good Friday agreement and the EU\u2019s single market rendered it invisible, helping to seal the peace. In Gortmullan \u2013 a patchwork of farms, bungalows and hedgerows \u2013 there are no road markings to indicate the frontier. Jack McGann, 16, who works at a service station just inside the Irish border, hesitated when asked to identify where the UK began. \u201cI\u2019m not 100% sure. I think it\u2019s over there by the shed, the line goes along the middle of it,\u201d he said, pointing at a derelict structure with a tin roof abutting a road. There are about 300 other border crossings. McGann has never known customs checks, army searches or terrorist attacks. \u201cMy parents told me stories about the hard border. I heard it was tough.\u201d Eugene McAffrey, who worked at an adjacent service station just inside Northern Ireland, sighed at the mention of Brexit. \u201cIt\u2019s occupying the mind of everyone that walks in here. How could it not?\u201d In a pub at Derrylin, a few miles up the road, Shane McBrien, a painter, seethed at the Democratic Unionist party for endorsing Johnson\u2019s plan. \u201cAny physical border will bring back bad memories. It\u2019s just going backwards.\u201d His brother, Eugene, said a hard border would compound the fact that Brexit ignored the will of most Northern Ireland voters. \u201cThe north voted to remain. We\u2019re being tossed out of the EU. We\u2019ve no say.\u201d Applications for Irish passports from Britain and especially Northern Ireland continue to surge, reaching 85,517 by the end of August, outpacing the 79,513 for all of 2018, according to figures released last week. A complex web connects the economies on both sides of the border. Trade in goods is worth about \u00a35.2bn. About a third of Northern Ireland\u2019s goods and services exports are sold to the Republic, while about a quarter of its imports come from the south. Downing Street says electronic paperwork and a \u201cvery small number\u201d of physical inspections at traders\u2019 premises would limit disruption. Farmers and business leaders dispute that. Some warn of disaster. Diageo, which makes Guinness and Baileys, estimates a hard border could cost it \u00a31.3m, based on an estimate of an hour\u2019s delay for each of the 18,000 beer trucks that traverse the border each year. Smaller businesses with tight margins could face ruin. \u201cMy business and family need flexibility,\u201d said Gerard Crowe, a butcher in Ballyconnell, inside the Republic. \u201cBut what\u2019s coming won\u2019t give flexibility. We\u2019ve been through all that before and we don\u2019t want it back.\u201d Dissident republicans have hailed Brexit \u2013 and specifically the prospect of a hard border \u2013 as a historic opportunity to revive an armed campaign. Public support for that seems negligible and attacks remain sporadic. But even before Johnson unveiled his plan there was a sense of the police battening down the hatches. Last Monday Irish police established a new armed support unit in Cavan, which borders Fermanagh, to combat a surge in criminality and to prepare for Brexit. The Police Service of Northern Ireland is planning to deploy hundreds of officers on Brexit-related operations and wants \u00a340m to recruit 300 additional officers. Simon Byrne, the PSNI chief constable, said he told the prime minister in a recent video call that his officers will not police any customs checkpoints or \u201cbe dragged\u201d into another type of policing. A bold assertion. Northern Ireland\u2019s history shows a hard border exerts a powerful drag.",

Creasy, meanwhile, has been repeatedly targeted in the past week by anti-abortion activists in her constituency of Walthamstow, east London. Last Thursday things ramped up a notch further when the high court in Belfast <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/03/northern-ireland-abortion-law-in-breach-of-human-rights-commitments\" title=\"\">ruled that Northern Ireland\u2019s abortion law breached the UK\u2019s human rights commitments</a>.

She became very ill and could not travel. She has legal training and in desperation set about researching her rights. She found there was a mental health clause that could enable her to have a termination in Northern Ireland. Phelan had, not long before this, survived several years of intense depression. The couple were terrified about the potential longterm impact of the dilemma she was now facing.

As a decentralised organisation, XR, as it is known, claims no hierarchy: it is open to all and operates a \u201cregenerative culture\u201d.</p> <p>In theory, this means responsibility and workload is designed to be a shared, collaborative effort with heavy emphasis on community, and mental and physical wellbeing.

Still, to witness it across uprisings in London in the spring, and across the UK over the summer at festivals and meetings, the spirit of XR is warm and often moving.

But those touched by Extinction Rebellion find it impossible to ignore the ways in which they are contributing to global heating.

      "body": "<p>I took my son to the library for the first time last week. This wasn\u2019t so much for his benefit as my own. Despite his newfound passion for story time, he has no real desire for more books, since he would happily hear one in particular until the end of time. No longer does he seek the narrative heft of <em>Happy Dog Sad Dog</em>, nor the earth-shattering revelations of <em>What\u2019s This on the Farm?</em> for he has become hopelessly infatuated with a new favourite, a desultory effort about a runaway bear.</p> <p>I\u2019d always, quite bravely, said the Nazis were wrong for banning books. Even their reasoning \u2013 that indecent literature could warp your mind, or inspire evil in a well-balanced reader \u2013 seemed absurd. I now know it makes a kind of sense, because if I read this book one more time I will break into a zoo and head-butt every last bear I find. I hate this book with a passion that frightens me, and I hate the runaway bear himself most of all. If he was my bear and he ran away from home, I\u2019d throw a street party. Its asinine plot and feckless protagonist have no such effect on my son, however, who will drag it to be read 20 times a day.</p> <p>For the sake of my sanity I buried it under a heap of toys and took him to the library to expand his collection.

      "bodyText": "I took my son to the library for the first time last week. This wasn\u2019t so much for his benefit as my own. Despite his newfound passion for story time, he has no real desire for more books, since he would happily hear one in particular until the end of time. No longer does he seek the narrative heft of Happy Dog Sad Dog, nor the earth-shattering revelations of What\u2019s This on the Farm? for he has become hopelessly infatuated with a new favourite, a desultory effort about a runaway bear. I\u2019d always, quite bravely, said the Nazis were wrong for banning books. Even their reasoning \u2013 that indecent literature could warp your mind, or inspire evil in a well-balanced reader \u2013 seemed absurd. I now know it makes a kind of sense, because if I read this book one more time I will break into a zoo and head-butt every last bear I find. I hate this book with a passion that frightens me, and I hate the runaway bear himself most of all. If he was my bear and he ran away from home, I\u2019d throw a street party. Its asinine plot and feckless protagonist have no such effect on my son, however, who will drag it to be read 20 times a day. For the sake of my sanity I buried it under a heap of toys and took him to the library to expand his collection. I felt a surge of guilt as I walked in because, like so many who love the idea of libraries, I haven\u2019t used them much since smartphones were invented. I spent a great deal of my childhood in libraries and was delighted to find certain truths remain comfortingly universal \u2013 carpet tiles so well-trodden they might as well be lino, arrestingly artful bubble writing in the handmade shelf displays and, of course, the ancient lore of librarian staff\u2026 For every two or three pleasant employees there is one who is incoherently furious that people keep coming into their place of work and, rudest of all, reading the books therein. So it was that Todd, all sweetness and light, showed me where the newest picture books were, the best place to pop my pram, and where the little toys might be found. It was left to his colleague Agnes to scowl at me when I asked for a pen, to sneer at my son like he was a stranded, foam-mouthed rottweiler, and to monitor my itinerary around the shelves as if I might, any minute now, pause by the Mystery section and start recruiting for Isis. It was, in short, a little slice of heaven. We left with eight books, a brochure for a culture evening we will not attend, and \u2013 joy of joys \u2013 Agnes\u2019s last pen.

The kind you see on the news. It\u2019s not that I expected Aaron Paul to live in a trailer, cooking meth in his underpants, but this is a surprise. To clarify, the rest of his Hollywood house is beautiful, befitting the star of one of the most successful TV shows of all time. <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/16/100-best-tv-shows-of-the-21st-century\" title=\"\">Breaking Bad</a></em> broke viewing records and was acclaimed as the high watermark in a golden age of long-form television. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/24/bryan-cranston-interview-isle-of-dogs-wes-anderson\" title=\"\">Bryan Cranston</a>\u2019s performance as chemistry-teacher-turned-drug-kingpin Walter White is often described as Shakespearian, yet it was the slow-burn arc of his slacker prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Jesse Pinkman, that was arguably more cathartic.

I\u2019m on top of the world.\u201d The breeziness contrasts sharply with his onscreen presence. There, he has a mania in his blue eyes and flushing skin, threat in the ravaged growl of his voice, but also beautiful vulnerability. We see the puppy inside the feral dog. No matter how intense the situation, you believe him as an actor. </p> <p>It\u2019s frustrating that since that finale, he hasn\u2019t taken on a leading role of weight. There was <em>Exodus</em>, an underwhelming Ridley Scott biblical epic, and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/mar/13/need-for-speed-review-scott-waugh\" title=\"\">Need for Speed</a></em>, an overtly foolish video game tie-in about street racers. He does produce the excellent cartoon <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/sep/14/how-bojack-horseman-became-the-most-empathetic-show-on-television\" title=\"\">BoJack Horseman</a></em> and his upcoming role in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/series/westworld--episode-by-episode\" title=\"\">Westworld</a></em> should be a better fit.

What might surprise them is that it\u2019s Jesse\u2019s film alone. Yet Paul is confident there\u2019s enough story to tell. \u201cI lived and breathed every moment of his life that we saw, and then some. This is the role of a lifetime.\u201d</p> <p>It must be a strange thing for a man in early middle age to be so closely identified with a baggy-panted drug dealer he first played in his mid-20s. \u201cI thought we finished that story six years ago,\u201d he acknowledges. \u201cAnd now I zipped on the skin again.\u201d But he\u2019d follow writer-director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/vince-gilligan\" title=\"\">Vince Gilligan</a> into a fire, and public appetite was overwhelming. \u201cPeople were just so passionate, and wanted answers.

The youngest child of a Southern Baptist minister, he grew up taking part in church plays. The family didn\u2019t have money, so from the age of 11 he started saving in a glass jar beside his bed for a move to Hollywood. Uninterested in girlfriends or anything else, he graduated a year early, moving to Los Angeles at 17, where his cute, boy-doll face started landing him commercials \u2013 around 50 national spots, even for rival companies. \u201cI know I did Vanilla Coke; there might have been a Pepsi.\u201d</p> <p>He was making plenty of money, but it wasn\u2019t what he wanted. By his early 20s they\u2019d dried up, though he was landing guest spots on major shows: <em>ER</em>, <em>The X-Files</em>, <em>NYPD Blue</em> and a recurring character in <em>Big Love</em> for HBO. Still, the reality of being an actor is rarely secure. \u201cThey\u2019d squeeze all my scenes into a day, so I was making about $600 an episode.\u201d He describes the age of 27 as the low point of his career: he\u2019d done six failed pilots that year and couldn\u2019t pay his bills. That\u2019s when the audition for <em>Breaking Bad</em> came through. His character wasn\u2019t supposed to survive the first season, but as Vince Gilligan observed the growing chemistry between Paul and Cranston, he adjusted his plan. Ratings for the show were initially modest, but the reviews were exceptional. \u201cWhen the first three series landed on Netflix, my life changed.\u201d</p> <p>Word of mouth and critical acclaim saw the show become a phenomenon, picking up fans by the legion. They still hold screener parties, crank out plot theories on message boards, make DIY art, display chest tattoos of Walter and Jesse cooking meth. The pair became endlessly memed, pop-cultural heroes. (Just a few days ago, a colleague of mine who has seen the series three times mentioned he owned Lego-style figures of them in their meth-cooking suits, and asked if I would bring them with me to be signed. I didn\u2019t.)</p> <p>It was crazy to be at the centre of it all, Paul says. Exposing as an artist, too. \u201cAt the beginning of my career I was not great. Even at the beginning of <em>Breaking Bad</em> \u2013 I was OK, I got the job. But I grew so much as an actor. Everyone saw it.\u201d He credits working alongside Cranston, describing him as a mentor. Their story is narratively satisfying: as Walter shades bitterly into the villain, his underachieving former student grows into a hero. But the story resonates at a deeper level than that. The actor looked so young in those early episodes. It\u2019s powerful, watching the deadbeat come good, because someone believed in him once: the parable of the prodigal son.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c060023949b0d4693af321f35bd8642917ff4bc9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c060023949b0d4693af321f35bd8642917ff4bc9/0_84_3185_1910/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Becoming a father is a front-row seat to the greatest show on earth\u2019: with his wife Lauren Parsekian, with whom he has a young daughter.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Becoming a father is a front-row seat to the greatest show on earth\u2019: with his wife Lauren Parsekian, with whom he has a young daughter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Or maybe people just think the show is a blast. Paul remembers being at a concert with an old friend he hadn\u2019t seen in a while, and who was in the middle of a crisis. \u201cHe\u2019d found out his fianc\u00e9e was cheating on him and just told me they\u2019d called off the wedding. I\u2019m hugging him, he\u2019s crying. This drunk girl comes up and screams \u201cYO, BITCH! Lemme take a picture with you, bitch!\u201d [A reference to Jesse\u2019s politically incorrect if undeniably funny catchphrase.] Paul tried to let her know it wasn\u2019t a good time, while protecting his friend\u2019s privacy. \u201cShe\u2019s like: \u2018You\u2019re not gonna take a picture? You\u2019re such an asshole, who do you think you are? Fuck you!\u2019\u201d He\u2019s aware that somewhere, she\u2019ll be passing around the story from her point of view about Aaron Paul, the arrogant jerk.</p> <p>Does the obsessive attention people pay the show ever get too much? \u201cAt least they like it,\u201d he shrugs. It\u2019s tough to penetrate the charming interview technique of a star who doesn\u2019t want to alienate his fan base. But there\u2019s a stranger aspect to it, in which Paul presents himself as just a regular guy with no issues. I find it impossible to believe. He\u2019s too good at inhabiting anguish, at being tortured. It has to come from somewhere deep. I noticed a lot of clown stuff around when I came in: Pierrot figurines, a coffee-table history of the circus. What\u2019s that about? \u201cI love Cirque du Soleil,\u201d he says. Hmm. How about the strange portraiture on the walls, unsettling works by artists <a href=\"https://www.markryden.com/\" title=\"\">Mark Ryden</a> and <a href=\"https://www.lolafineart.com/\" title=\"\">Lola Gil</a>? Paul doesn\u2019t understand why people find them creepy. \u201cIt\u2019s just a baby riding a lamb.\u201d</p> <p>I probe a little deeper \u2013 trying to find out what\u2019s in his basement, so to speak. What was it like being raised in a devoutly religious house? \u201cVery intense. My father had me quote scripture. I still have multiple scriptures in my head.\u201d What\u2019s his favourite? \u201cI don\u2019t have a favourite,\u201d he says quickly. He\u2019s not religious and doesn\u2019t want to tell anyone how to think. I wonder what his parents make of their son being an icon for meth-heads. They\u2019re fans of <em>Breaking Bad</em>, he assures me, although there are projects of his they don\u2019t like. <em>Need for Speed</em>? If Paul is offended, he doesn\u2019t let it show. \u201cNo, they love <em>Need for Speed</em>. They thought it was a fun movie.\u201d</p> <p>So where on earth does that intensity and access to emotion come from? You\u2019ve just got to act, Paul tells me. Force yourself to believe a situation is real. He looks amused and apologetic, as if he\u2019s sorry he couldn\u2019t help with my enquiries. \u201cSome actors think about dead puppies. I do not.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"baf832f2881e824e8d495f76820d78756a49170f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/baf832f2881e824e8d495f76820d78756a49170f/0_0_3100_1859/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Meet and greet: signing autographs as he arrives at the 20th annual Screen Actors Guild Awards in Los Angeles.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Meet and greet: signing autographs as he arrives at the 20th annual Screen Actors Guild Awards in Los Angeles.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mario Anzuoni/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I wonder why I\u2019m so attached to the idea of the tortured artist, working out their demons though their work. I suppose we\u2019re hungry for the story beneath the story. It\u2019s possible he really is this happy. Who wouldn\u2019t be? Paul has just returned from a 10-day party for his 40th birthday, celebrated at a private resort in the Dominican Republic with close friends including Bryan Cranston and <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1157358/\" title=\"\">Michelle Monaghan</a>. He has won multiple Emmys and is financially set for life. But the source of his bliss is far smaller.</p> <p>Her name is Story, his daughter with wife <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3680618/\" title=\"\">Lauren Parsekian</a>. The 19-month-old has been perched on his lap, but he disappears for a few minutes to put her down. He\u2019d never wanted children, he admits when he returns, although his partner did. He was in his late 30s, scared of giving up his freedom. \u201cThank God I changed my mind, man. My life began when she was born.\u201d His blue eyes are lit up. Fittingly, it was acting that brought about the conversion \u2013 playing a dad of two in <em>The Path</em>, the cancelled Hulu show about a spiritual leader experiencing a crisis of faith.</p> <p>Working with young actors who would throw their arms around him, entering the mindset of being a caretaker, made Paul realise he was open to the idea of being a father. He kept the revelation a secret from his wife for six months. When he finally told her, she made him repeat the words. She\u2019d married on the understanding a family was not on the table, had chosen a life with him, rather than kids with someone else. \u201cAfter having a child, I realise what a sacrifice that was. I hadn\u2019t understood,\u201d he says.</p> <p>He\u2019s talking with an energy and sincerity I naively thought we\u2019d share discussing a TV show. \u201cThrough babies\u2019 eyes, you see a sense of wonder in the world that you\u2019ve grown used to. Hearing their heartbeat for the first time, watching the delivery, feeding them in the middle of the night, everything is\u2026 so powerful. A front-row seat to the greatest show on earth.\u201d</p> <p>One that\u2019s even better than <em>Breaking Bad</em>? This is what life is about, he confirms, before the inevitable disclaimer. \u201cKids aren\u2019t for everybody.\u201d I\u2019d had other questions about the film and acting, but they feel pedestrian now. Is this the end of Jesse\u2019s story? (Probably.) Is there any work he\u2019s not interested in? (Slapstick comedy, though he has nothing against it.) Who is his favourite actor? (Brad Pitt \u2013 a character actor in leading-man disguise.)How much of Jesse\u2019s swearing was down to him? (\u201c100% of those bitches were scripted. Not once did I improv a \u2018bitch\u2019.\u201d)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"caaf4286a5d7475819d45abdcf987a238bef920b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/caaf4286a5d7475819d45abdcf987a238bef920b/0_238_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018People want to know what happens to Jesse\u2019: in El Camino.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018People want to know what happens to Jesse\u2019: in El Camino.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Rothstein/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I think we\u2019ve finally broken through. Paul asks if I want to take a walk. The garden is an entire hillside with stepped terrace beds of enormous tropical plants and waterfalls. We admire a pond of koi carp, one of which is called Thom Yorke. Huge butterflies flap lazily around us; dragonflies flash like jewels in the sun. \u201cWe have a place on the river in Idaho, too\u2013 dragonflies land on you there,\u201d he muses. It\u2019s beautiful, I sigh. \u201cYeah \u2013 always two of them, having sex. Using you like an anchor,\u201d he finishes.</p> <p>He\u2019s landscaping the curving garden to its natural advantage, creating a lush green amphitheatre for his favourite bands to play. This is something the music-loving couple has always done, hosting intimate sets by stadium acts and tiny indie bands alike for family and friends. (He shows me his phone \u2013 his wife is saved as \u201cLauren Coachella\u201d, because of where they met.) Parsekian is president of Kind, an anti-bullying non-profit. \u201cIt\u2019s been a privilege seeing her turn into a mother,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I wear being a father well. It\u2019s not all about work, now,\u201d he explains. </p> <p><em><strong>We return to</strong></em> the house, a classic Hollywood villa with cool stone walls and decorated wooden ceilings. It\u2019s the oldest in the immediate area. Having moved in five months ago, they plan to stay here forever. It\u2019s not hard to see why. He takes me into a side room that contains his treasured possessions: on the shelves I spy his gleaming Emmy awards, and the burned-up pink bear that falls from the sky in <em>Breaking Bad</em>\u2019s second season. But they\u2019re not what he wants me to see. He really does love drinking, he tells me as he opens a door to the side. Behind it is another full-sized safe-door, which he unlocks. Inside, a cupboard is lined with ancient, burlap-wrapped bottles of booze. It\u2019s pretty cool, but there\u2019s more. \u201cThe house was built during Prohibition,\u201d he explains. Reaching down, he flips a tiny, disguised latch built into a corner. The floor opens and reveals the bare concrete steps leading down to a secret room. It\u2019s a speakeasy. I start laughing, too, from the surprise. Paul intends to design the bar himself and have parties here. It\u2019s easily the coolest thing I\u2019ve ever seen.</p> <p>So, is he just going to bunker down with his family, and drink? No, there will be acting. But he\u2019s learned to be picky, only taking on work that challenges him. He prides himself on wearing different skins, has always seen himself as a character actor.</p> <p>\u201cThere are roles I jumped on to after <em>Breaking Bad</em>, just to try to move the needle in one direction or another. I get sent a lot of leading-man stuff and it doesn\u2019t excite me. My heart is in gritty, independent filmmaking.\u201d He wants to be dragged through the mud, he says. \u201cYou\u2019ll see a lot more of that in my career from now on.\u201d He tells me he\u2019s been toying with the idea of physical transformation for his next role. \u201cI\u2019ve got a year-and-a half hiatus between seasons of <em>Westworld</em> \u2013 enough time to pack on a bunch of weight and lose it, if I wanted to.\u201d He\u2019s still deciding if he has the courage for it. He\u2019s enjoying the artistic freedom of success: the ability to move at one\u2019s own pace, the power to choose. He\u2019s also learned there\u2019s more to life than acting.</p> <p>I remain unconvinced there isn\u2019t a little darkness in him. As I\u2019m leaving, we pass the circus figurines and I ask him about them again. \u201cI\u2019m not scared of clowns,\u201d he says quickly. \u201cBut the idea of a clown at a party\u2026\u201d he stares off for a few seconds, blue eyes narrowed in thought. I wonder whether he\u2019s reliving a memory. Or perhaps imagining how he would play a clown and what it might reveal. He\u2019s somewhere else for a few seconds, before he returns to the room. \u201cI have nothing against clowns,\u201d he says. For once, I\u2019m not sure I believe him.</p> <p><em>El Camino: a Breaking Bad Movie is on Netflix on 11 October</em></p>",

By his early 20s they\u2019d dried up, though he was landing guest spots on major shows: ER, The X-Files, NYPD Blue and a recurring character in Big Love for HBO. Still, the reality of being an actor is rarely secure. \u201cThey\u2019d squeeze all my scenes into a day, so I was making about $600 an episode.\u201d He describes the age of 27 as the low point of his career: he\u2019d done six failed pilots that year and couldn\u2019t pay his bills. That\u2019s when the audition for Breaking Bad came through. His character wasn\u2019t supposed to survive the first season, but as Vince Gilligan observed the growing chemistry between Paul and Cranston, he adjusted his plan. Ratings for the show were initially modest, but the reviews were exceptional. \u201cWhen the first three series landed on Netflix, my life changed.\u201d Word of mouth and critical acclaim saw the show become a phenomenon, picking up fans by the legion. They still hold screener parties, crank out plot theories on message boards, make DIY art, display chest tattoos of Walter and Jesse cooking meth. The pair became endlessly memed, pop-cultural heroes. (Just a few days ago, a colleague of mine who has seen the series three times mentioned he owned Lego-style figures of them in their meth-cooking suits, and asked if I would bring them with me to be signed. I didn\u2019t.) It was crazy to be at the centre of it all, Paul says. Exposing as an artist, too. \u201cAt the beginning of my career I was not great. Even at the beginning of Breaking Bad \u2013 I was OK, I got the job. But I grew so much as an actor. Everyone saw it.\u201d He credits working alongside Cranston, describing him as a mentor. Their story is narratively satisfying: as Walter shades bitterly into the villain, his underachieving former student grows into a hero. But the story resonates at a deeper level than that. The actor looked so young in those early episodes. It\u2019s powerful, watching the deadbeat come good, because someone believed in him once: the parable of the prodigal son. Or maybe people just think the show is a blast. Paul remembers being at a concert with an old friend he hadn\u2019t seen in a while, and who was in the middle of a crisis. \u201cHe\u2019d found out his fianc\u00e9e was cheating on him and just told me they\u2019d called off the wedding. I\u2019m hugging him, he\u2019s crying. This drunk girl comes up and screams \u201cYO, BITCH! Lemme take a picture with you, bitch!\u201d [A reference to Jesse\u2019s politically incorrect if undeniably funny catchphrase.] Paul tried to let her know it wasn\u2019t a good time, while protecting his friend\u2019s privacy. \u201cShe\u2019s like: \u2018You\u2019re not gonna take a picture? You\u2019re such an asshole, who do you think you are? Fuck you!\u2019\u201d He\u2019s aware that somewhere, she\u2019ll be passing around the story from her point of view about Aaron Paul, the arrogant jerk. Does the obsessive attention people pay the show ever get too much? \u201cAt least they like it,\u201d he shrugs. It\u2019s tough to penetrate the charming interview technique of a star who doesn\u2019t want to alienate his fan base. But there\u2019s a stranger aspect to it, in which Paul presents himself as just a regular guy with no issues. I find it impossible to believe. He\u2019s too good at inhabiting anguish, at being tortured. It has to come from somewhere deep. I noticed a lot of clown stuff around when I came in: Pierrot figurines, a coffee-table history of the circus. What\u2019s that about? \u201cI love Cirque du Soleil,\u201d he says. Hmm. How about the strange portraiture on the walls, unsettling works by artists Mark Ryden and Lola Gil? Paul doesn\u2019t understand why people find them creepy. \u201cIt\u2019s just a baby riding a lamb.\u201d I probe a little deeper \u2013 trying to find out what\u2019s in his basement, so to speak. What was it like being raised in a devoutly religious house? \u201cVery intense. My father had me quote scripture. I still have multiple scriptures in my head.\u201d What\u2019s his favourite? \u201cI don\u2019t have a favourite,\u201d he says quickly. He\u2019s not religious and doesn\u2019t want to tell anyone how to think. I wonder what his parents make of their son being an icon for meth-heads. They\u2019re fans of Breaking Bad, he assures me, although there are projects of his they don\u2019t like. Need for Speed? If Paul is offended, he doesn\u2019t let it show. \u201cNo, they love Need for Speed. They thought it was a fun movie.\u201d So where on earth does that intensity and access to emotion come from? You\u2019ve just got to act, Paul tells me. Force yourself to believe a situation is real. He looks amused and apologetic, as if he\u2019s sorry he couldn\u2019t help with my enquiries. \u201cSome actors think about dead puppies. I do not.\u201d I wonder why I\u2019m so attached to the idea of the tortured artist, working out their demons though their work. I suppose we\u2019re hungry for the story beneath the story. It\u2019s possible he really is this happy. Who wouldn\u2019t be? Paul has just returned from a 10-day party for his 40th birthday, celebrated at a private resort in the Dominican Republic with close friends including Bryan Cranston and Michelle Monaghan. He has won multiple Emmys and is financially set for life. But the source of his bliss is far smaller. Her name is Story, his daughter with wife Lauren Parsekian. The 19-month-old has been perched on his lap, but he disappears for a few minutes to put her down. He\u2019d never wanted children, he admits when he returns, although his partner did. He was in his late 30s, scared of giving up his freedom. \u201cThank God I changed my mind, man. My life began when she was born.\u201d His blue eyes are lit up. Fittingly, it was acting that brought about the conversion \u2013 playing a dad of two in The Path, the cancelled Hulu show about a spiritual leader experiencing a crisis of faith. Working with young actors who would throw their arms around him, entering the mindset of being a caretaker, made Paul realise he was open to the idea of being a father. He kept the revelation a secret from his wife for six months. When he finally told her, she made him repeat the words. She\u2019d married on the understanding a family was not on the table, had chosen a life with him, rather than kids with someone else. \u201cAfter having a child, I realise what a sacrifice that was. I hadn\u2019t understood,\u201d he says. He\u2019s talking with an energy and sincerity I naively thought we\u2019d share discussing a TV show. \u201cThrough babies\u2019 eyes, you see a sense of wonder in the world that you\u2019ve grown used to. Hearing their heartbeat for the first time, watching the delivery, feeding them in the middle of the night, everything is\u2026 so powerful. A front-row seat to the greatest show on earth.\u201d One that\u2019s even better than Breaking Bad? This is what life is about, he confirms, before the inevitable disclaimer. \u201cKids aren\u2019t for everybody.\u201d I\u2019d had other questions about the film and acting, but they feel pedestrian now. Is this the end of Jesse\u2019s story? (Probably.) Is there any work he\u2019s not interested in? (Slapstick comedy, though he has nothing against it.) Who is his favourite actor? (Brad Pitt \u2013 a character actor in leading-man disguise.)How much of Jesse\u2019s swearing was down to him? (\u201c100% of those bitches were scripted. Not once did I improv a \u2018bitch\u2019.\u201d) I think we\u2019ve finally broken through. Paul asks if I want to take a walk. The garden is an entire hillside with stepped terrace beds of enormous tropical plants and waterfalls. We admire a pond of koi carp, one of which is called Thom Yorke. Huge butterflies flap lazily around us; dragonflies flash like jewels in the sun. \u201cWe have a place on the river in Idaho, too\u2013 dragonflies land on you there,\u201d he muses. It\u2019s beautiful, I sigh. \u201cYeah \u2013 always two of them, having sex. Using you like an anchor,\u201d he finishes. He\u2019s landscaping the curving garden to its natural advantage, creating a lush green amphitheatre for his favourite bands to play. This is something the music-loving couple has always done, hosting intimate sets by stadium acts and tiny indie bands alike for family and friends. (He shows me his phone \u2013 his wife is saved as \u201cLauren Coachella\u201d, because of where they met.) Parsekian is president of Kind, an anti-bullying non-profit. \u201cIt\u2019s been a privilege seeing her turn into a mother,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I wear being a father well. It\u2019s not all about work, now,\u201d he explains. We return to the house, a classic Hollywood villa with cool stone walls and decorated wooden ceilings. It\u2019s the oldest in the immediate area. Having moved in five months ago, they plan to stay here forever. It\u2019s not hard to see why. He takes me into a side room that contains his treasured possessions: on the shelves I spy his gleaming Emmy awards, and the burned-up pink bear that falls from the sky in Breaking Bad\u2019s second season. But they\u2019re not what he wants me to see. He really does love drinking, he tells me as he opens a door to the side. Behind it is another full-sized safe-door, which he unlocks. Inside, a cupboard is lined with ancient, burlap-wrapped bottles of booze. It\u2019s pretty cool, but there\u2019s more. \u201cThe house was built during Prohibition,\u201d he explains. Reaching down, he flips a tiny, disguised latch built into a corner. The floor opens and reveals the bare concrete steps leading down to a secret room. It\u2019s a speakeasy. I start laughing, too, from the surprise. Paul intends to design the bar himself and have parties here. It\u2019s easily the coolest thing I\u2019ve ever seen. So, is he just going to bunker down with his family, and drink? No, there will be acting. But he\u2019s learned to be picky, only taking on work that challenges him. He prides himself on wearing different skins, has always seen himself as a character actor. \u201cThere are roles I jumped on to after Breaking Bad, just to try to move the needle in one direction or another. I get sent a lot of leading-man stuff and it doesn\u2019t excite me. My heart is in gritty, independent filmmaking.\u201d He wants to be dragged through the mud, he says. \u201cYou\u2019ll see a lot more of that in my career from now on.\u201d He tells me he\u2019s been toying with the idea of physical transformation for his next role. \u201cI\u2019ve got a year-and-a half hiatus between seasons of Westworld \u2013 enough time to pack on a bunch of weight and lose it, if I wanted to.\u201d He\u2019s still deciding if he has the courage for it. He\u2019s enjoying the artistic freedom of success: the ability to move at one\u2019s own pace, the power to choose. He\u2019s also learned there\u2019s more to life than acting. I remain unconvinced there isn\u2019t a little darkness in him. As I\u2019m leaving, we pass the circus figurines and I ask him about them again. \u201cI\u2019m not scared of clowns,\u201d he says quickly. \u201cBut the idea of a clown at a party\u2026\u201d he stares off for a few seconds, blue eyes narrowed in thought. I wonder whether he\u2019s reliving a memory. Or perhaps imagining how he would play a clown and what it might reveal. He\u2019s somewhere else for a few seconds, before he returns to the room. \u201cI have nothing against clowns,\u201d he says. For once, I\u2019m not sure I believe him.

Under Nathanial Gleicher, the former White House director for cybersecurity policy, the company has regularly taken action against \u201cco-ordinated inauthentic behaviour\u201d: the sort of organised professional trolling that Russia\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/dec/22/facebook-tool-russia-troll-army-internet-research-agency\" title=\"\">Internet Research Agency</a> pioneered in the early 2010s and which was used to try to influence the 2016 American presidential election.</p> <p>But Facebook\u2019s standards for paid adverts are less clear. In August, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/01/revealed-johnson-allys-firm-secretly-ran-facebook-propaganda-network\" title=\"\"><em>Guardian</em> investigation uncovered a propaganda network run by Boris Johnson ally Lynton Crosby</a>. The Australian PR guru ran adverts and Facebook pages that purported to be independent outlets reporting on particular topics, but were actually fronts for promoting the views of Crosby\u2019s clients. When challenged on this, Facebook said the difference between banned inauthentic behaviour from Russians and permitted inauthentic behaviour from Australians was that the Australians used their real names on their accounts.</p> <p>Even without exploitation of that sort of obvious loophole, however, Facebook is likely to be a battleground. The social network is already receiving thousands of pounds a week from British political parties; currently leading in spending is the Brexit party, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/report/?source=archive-landing-page&amp;country=GB\" title=\"\">with \u00a319,600 of adverts in the last seven days</a>. After Boris Johnson became leader of the Conservative party, it briefly saw spending rocket, but not enough to beat the Brexit party\u2019s ongoing splurge.</p> <p>One major aspect of Facebook\u2019s political advertising that has never been fixed by the company is the platform\u2019s algorithmic push towards extremity. In the US presidential election, it emerged that Donald <a href=\"https://observer.com/2018/02/facebook-ads-trump-clinton-2016-election/\" title=\"\">Trump\u2019s team had paid less per advert</a>, because their more inflammatory messages got far more reaction from Facebook users, which led the company\u2019s algorithm to prioritise them, creating a virtuous circle that could still be exploited today.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30e4fc0c0e77e5bf36d93414d7bf4fc2a4f98a08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30e4fc0c0e77e5bf36d93414d7bf4fc2a4f98a08/0_33_4252_2551/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Instagram feeds, such as this one by Gavin Williamson, often become political battlegrounds, but are difficult to police.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Instagram feeds, such as this one by Gavin Williamson, often become political battlegrounds, but are difficult to police.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: @GavinWilliamson/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Instagram</strong> </h2> <p>Facebook\u2019s second social network has been steadily folded into the mothership over the past year.

For all the damage that integration could do to the consumer experience, it has one major positive aspect: giving Instagram access to the same tools Facebook has already built to try to prevent a repeat of 2016.</p> <p>Last month, for instance, Instagram finally received access to fact-checking tools that Facebook launched in the US in December 2016. It\u2019s a harder job to fact-check Instagram, because of the nature of the two sites. On Facebook, fake news frequently spreads in the form of links to claims made on low-quality news sites. That means that one fact-check can be reused every time someone reposts that same link, greatly reducing the spread of false claims.</p> <p>Instagram, by contrast, sees much of its fake news spread in the form of images, screenshots and text captions, which are much harder to automatically find and flag. So for years, misinformation has flourished on the platform, albeit largely about health and beauty tips than politics. Now that third-party fact-checkers are finally able to mark those claims as false, distribution should fall as a result.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"211432f714852cd7bd6abbf6c047038e7edcd861\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/211432f714852cd7bd6abbf6c047038e7edcd861/0_165_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube\u2019s efforts to combat fake news have looked half-hearted.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">YouTube\u2019s efforts to combat fake news have looked half-hearted.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dado Ruvi\u0107/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>YouTube</strong> </h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/cambridge-analytica\" title=\"\">Cambridge Analytica</a> was the best thing that ever happened to YouTube.

That\u2019s partially because, since it closed Google+ earlier this year, YouTube is the closest thing to a social network that the company runs and social networks are doomed to be the frontline of any election campaign.</p> <p>But the company has followed in Facebook\u2019s footsteps with a political advertising archive, showing the tiny number of political adverts that have run on its platform in the past six months. The company has flagged just 400 adverts in the UK, with a total spend of \u00a332,000 \u2013 and most of those appear to be adverts for the Romanian PNL, either mistakenly targeted at Brits or aiming to win over expat voters. The report is, however, detailed enough to show that <a href=\"https://transparencyreport.google.com/political-ads/advertiser/AR338691087918956544\" title=\"\">Google has received \u00a312,000 from Labour since 31 May</a>, to run 34 adverts attacking Boris Johnson and a no-deal Brexit and promoting its own policies.</p> <p>But in a recent study, campaign group<a href=\"https://privacyinternational.org/\" title=\"\"> Privacy International</a> (PI) argued that the data was woefully inadequate. The company\u2019s ad library, it said, provided \u201cbroad ranges of targeting information on some ads in some countries, instead of meaningful insight into how an ad or campaign was targeted\u201d. Without that extra information, it\u2019s impossible to know what the adverts are actually being used for \u2013 and how they might be affecting democracy.</p> <p>Other questions are harder to answer. Does the company\u2019s search implicitly promote particular views, for instance? Are fake news purveyors being boosted by credulous algorithms? Unlike social networks, there are no public metrics to easily measure and so Google could be doing much more damage than anyone realises.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7309ce4f52b9f8be421751829bc49743d56488f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7309ce4f52b9f8be421751829bc49743d56488f6/0_195_5862_3517/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The media\u2019s reliance on Twitter has given it a bigger influence than other social media sites.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The media\u2019s reliance on Twitter has given it a bigger influence than other social media sites.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: J David Ake/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Twitter</strong> </h2> <p>Twitter\u2019s effect on elections is somewhat more direct than most other social networks, because the news media are essentially addicted to the app. As a result, a comparatively small user base has an outsize influence on the national discourse, making the site an attractive target.</p> <p>Like Facebook, Twitter has made great progress in identifying and removing those who do try to flood the site with inauthentic behaviour.

As a result, researchers spend a substantial amount of time trying to quantify the effect of \u201cbots\u201d (automated software) on the platform. Twitter responds that only it really knows the answer but it can\u2019t share the truth, because the bots have privacy rights too.</p> <p>The outcome is a noisy argument, where everyone accuses everyone else\u2019s supporters of being Russian, bots or Russian bots, and discourse crumbles. It seems unlikely that Twitter will be able to do anything about that in time for an election. It\u2019s unclear if it even wants to. Twitter once described itself as the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/mar/22/twitter-tony-wang-free-speech\" title=\"\">free-speech wing of the free-speech party</a>\u201d in Silicon Valley and for years, that approach left the company far behind its competitors in what is now termed \u201cplatform health\u201d \u2013 combating abuse and threats of violence.</p> <p>More generally, Twitter hasn\u2019t kept up with the state of the industry on electoral transparency. In PI\u2019s study, it found numerous examples of political adverts that weren\u2019t disclosed anywhere else on the site. The company does have a specific definition of \u201cpolitical adverts\u201d, but has never yet applied that to UK elections, although it said it is \u201cworking to support UK elections and other EU member states\u2019 national elections throughout the next year\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Snapchat</strong></h2> <p>It might not be the first place you think about when it comes to political campaigning, but Snapchat is gearing up for information warfare just in case. The company recently released its political advertising archive \u2013 a feature that is fast becoming non-optional for online advertisers \u2013 and while it is US-only, it seems likely it would make it to the UK in time for an election.</p> <p>And Snapchat has always been proud of the fact that, when it comes to news media, it is explicitly a publisher not a platform. News on Snapchat is selected by the company, posted to special channels, and subject to the same quality controls as traditional broadcast media: the company voluntarily applies FCC standards to the content it broadcasts. To be sure, most of it is stuff the <em>Daily Mail</em> wouldn\u2019t even touch for its website\u2019s notorious sidebar of shame, but it\u2019s the thought that counts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"423b1756f628a33796e891eeddb2d22fed4ea37d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/423b1756f628a33796e891eeddb2d22fed4ea37d/0_38_4657_2794/1000.jpg\" alt=\"WhatsApp has been blamed for lynchings in India driven by rumours spread on the service.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">WhatsApp has been blamed for lynchings in India driven by rumours spread on the service.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rafiq Maqbool/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>WhatsApp</strong> </h2> <p>With its end-to-end encryption and lack of broadcast tools, Facebook-owned WhatsApp is the most opaque major platform. We can only judge it by its effects, which are not positive. It has been credibly blamed for huge waves of disinformation sweeping India, leading to numerous deaths in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/15/india-police-arrest-25-people-after-latest-whatsapp-mob-lynching-child-kidnapping-rumours\" title=\"\">rumour-driven lynchings</a>.

Unlike conventional social networks, the company cannot read the contents of messages, meaning it can do much less to limit spam and misinformation. Instead, it has focused on making it harder to forward messages to hundreds of people at a time, clearly marking information as forwarded \u2013 and not originated by the immediate sender \u2013 and limiting the use of broadcast lists.</p>",

It seems unlikely that Twitter will be able to do anything about that in time for an election. It\u2019s unclear if it even wants to. Twitter once described itself as the \u201cfree-speech wing of the free-speech party\u201d in Silicon Valley and for years, that approach left the company far behind its competitors in what is now termed \u201cplatform health\u201d \u2013 combating abuse and threats of violence. More generally, Twitter hasn\u2019t kept up with the state of the industry on electoral transparency. In PI\u2019s study, it found numerous examples of political adverts that weren\u2019t disclosed anywhere else on the site. The company does have a specific definition of \u201cpolitical adverts\u201d, but has never yet applied that to UK elections, although it said it is \u201cworking to support UK elections and other EU member states\u2019 national elections throughout the next year\u201d. Snapchat It might not be the first place you think about when it comes to political campaigning, but Snapchat is gearing up for information warfare just in case. The company recently released its political advertising archive \u2013 a feature that is fast becoming non-optional for online advertisers \u2013 and while it is US-only, it seems likely it would make it to the UK in time for an election. And Snapchat has always been proud of the fact that, when it comes to news media, it is explicitly a publisher not a platform. News on Snapchat is selected by the company, posted to special channels, and subject to the same quality controls as traditional broadcast media: the company voluntarily applies FCC standards to the content it broadcasts. To be sure, most of it is stuff the Daily Mail wouldn\u2019t even touch for its website\u2019s notorious sidebar of shame, but it\u2019s the thought that counts. WhatsApp With its end-to-end encryption and lack of broadcast tools, Facebook-owned WhatsApp is the most opaque major platform. We can only judge it by its effects, which are not positive. It has been credibly blamed for huge waves of disinformation sweeping India, leading to numerous deaths in rumour-driven lynchings. In Brazil, campaigners for all parties, but particularly far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro, used the service, sending up to 300,000 messages at a time to many of the country\u2019s 120m WhatsApp users. WhatsApp argues that it is limited in how it can fight abuse by the privacy features that make it so desirable to activists and campaigners worldwide. Unlike conventional social networks, the company cannot read the contents of messages, meaning it can do much less to limit spam and misinformation. Instead, it has focused on making it harder to forward messages to hundreds of people at a time, clearly marking information as forwarded \u2013 and not originated by the immediate sender \u2013 and limiting the use of broadcast lists.",

      "bodyText": "Czech police have been put on high alert for the arrival of an estimated 6,000 English supporters here for Friday\u2019s Euro 2020 qualifier between England and the Czech Republic, with preparations afoot to deploy anti-riot squads in the event of violent disorder. With widespread fears of alcohol\u2011fuelled disturbances that could be exacerbated by the country\u2019s reputation for cheap beer, an unprecedented number of officers \u2013 including special English\u2011speaking \u201canti-conflict units\u201d \u2013 will patrol the capital\u2019s tourist districts for a fixture designated as high risk. Criminal, traffic and helicopter units, along with police on horseback, will be on duty for a match that has already drawn an appeal from the England manager, Gareth Southgate, for fans to be on their best behaviour. Police have vowed to show zero tolerance for violations of local laws, which limit the consumption of alcohol on the streets and demand quiet in neighbourhoods deemed residential after 10pm. The operation will be backed up by 11 British officers, the Czech Republic\u2019s biggest deployment of foreign police agents for a match, as spotters responsible for identifying and communicating with troublesome English supporters. The match will be played at Slavia Prague\u2019s Eden Arena, several miles from the city centre. Lt-Col Jakub Scho\u0159, of the Czech police presidium\u2019s national football information unit, called the game \u201ca big challenge [because] so many fans have never [before] come to Prague before at one time\u201d. He added: \u201cPrague is a very attractive city for away fans in terms of price of beer and by playing the fixture on Friday night it has a new dimension and becomes even more attractive. With such a big number of away fans, it is assumed that some misbehaviour may occur.\u201d Most fans are expected to spend the weekend in Prague, putting an added burden on a city already struggling to cope with the effects of modern tourism, including a flourishing trade in organised pub crawls that have elicited complaints from local residents. Prague\u2019s extensive surveillance camera system will be used to monitor fans\u2019 behaviour away from the stadium, a city council spokesperson said. Security plans have been under way for months, with the Football Association, its Czech equivalent, the local municipality, the England supporters\u2019 club and the British embassy in Prague all involved. The embassy\u2019s consular section will be on standby for emergencies. It has prepared a video of dos and don\u2019ts to be posted on Facebook and Twitter. Along with the supporters\u2019 club, it is setting up a stall in the city centre to act as an information base. Some bar owners are taking contingency steps. O\u2019Che\u2019s Irish bar, in the historic old town district, will hire extra security guards to deal with potentially unruly fans. \u201cWe are not really worried, because we have English people every weekend,\u201d said Jan, the bar\u2019s manager, who declined to give his last name. \u201cBut we know that English fans can be completely crazy when they are angry. But it\u2019s business and we\u2019ll survive.\u201d Local police have dismissed the risk of organised violence but are concerned Czech hooligans may try to seize flags as trophies. \u201cEnglish fans are considered everywhere in the world an attractive rival, so it is likely that Czech hooligans will attempt to obtain English flags,\u201d said Scho\u0159. \u201cThe risk [lies] in the antisocial behaviour of individuals, which, considering the big amount of away fans, may lead to massive spontaneous disturbances.\u201d In that case, the police would be ready to use force, he said. \u201cVisiting fans are more than welcome but if the situation is getting worse and needs an intervention of anti-riot units, we are ready to take action. I recommend to follow instructions given by the police in order to avoid any useless troubles such as paying a fine or being arrested.\u201d",

Three years of post-referendum Brexit debate has already knocked around 2% off the path of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/31/uk-economy-growth-record-trade-deficit\" title=\"\">GDP growth predictions made in March 2016</a> by the Treasury\u2019s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility.

Without stable retail sales and a surge in unfunded government spending over the past year, mostly to employ more civil servants to cope with Brexit, the UK would be in recession.</p> <p>Manufacturing, construction and the services sector all contracted last month at a speed that many economists found shocking. Boris Johnson may believe he is justified in hailing the strength of the UK economy as he seeks to shore up support for leaving the EU. Businesses would say otherwise.</p> <p>Across the Atlantic, Trump\u2019s inclination would be to ask Congress for more tax cuts to keep consumers happy. Friday\u2019s non-farm payroll numbers showed unemployment falling to a 50-year low and wages rising to keep consumers spending, despite job creation slowing markedly. Like their UK counterparts, US consumers have so far remained immune to talk of a recession. But Congress is in no mood to give the president anything at the moment \u2013 especially while an impeachment inquiry is in full flow.</p> <p>So the president turned instead to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/21/trump-raises-pressure-on-federal-reserve-to-cut-interest-rates\" title=\"\">berating the US Federal Reserve into </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/21/trump-raises-pressure-on-federal-reserve-to-cut-interest-rates\" title=\"\">cutting interest rates</a>, which acts like a tax giveaway for indebted consumers.

And it may do again before the year is out, though the pace of rate cuts is not fast enough for Trump.</p> <p>The president is aware that interest rate cuts have turned into a competitive game. Cuts by the Fed have merely kept pace with moves by the European Central Bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China and the Bank of Japan to ease credit and make it cheaper to borrow. The Bank of England is likely to be next.</p> <p>These moves limit the effect of US policymaking and rob Trump of his only mechanism to prevent the current slowdown accelerating into 2020 and his re-election year.</p> <h2>It survived Deepwater, but BP is oblivious to the danger to us all</h2> <p>Bob Dudley\u2019s legacy as boss of BP will be forever defined by the aftermath of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/16/bps-deepwater-horizon-bill-tops-65bn\">Deepwater Horizon disaster</a> and the slump in global oil prices only a few years later.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s cunning plan to make America great again by launching a trade war with China has officially backfired. Last week, a keenly watched measure of US manufacturing showed firms cutting back on production and jobs at a rate not seen since 2009. Recession warning lights are flashing and the outlook seems a world away from the cheery one presented by the president when he entered the White House in 2017. It is quite something for a president to impose a trade policy that weighs heavily on parts of a crucial sector for the US economy \u2013 and it\u2019s a bizarre tactic given that the votes of manufacturing workers delivered him his first term in office. Economists had predicted the financial consequences for carmakers, machine-tool firms and the plastics industry following a tit-for-tat battle over import tariffs \u2013 as had trade experts over the course of the past 18 months. They were unanimous that Trump\u2019s plan to raise the tariff on hundreds of products, and China\u2019s determination to return the favour, would hurt both countries. While it has proved to be a bigger blow to Chinese exporters, it was inevitable that US companies would also suffer, and not just because their exports would be more expensive for Chinese consumers. The trade war has spilled over to infect the furthest reaches of the global economy, damaging business confidence and dragging down growth in Japan, the eurozone and much of the developing world. Britain could not be in a worse position, with its own self-inflicted economic woes only adding to the negative effects of the global slowdown. Three years of post-referendum Brexit debate has already knocked around 2% off the path of GDP growth predictions made in March 2016 by the Treasury\u2019s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility. That means the UK would now be about \u00a340bn richer if the referendum had never taken place. The September surveys of business sentiment show that talk of a no-deal Brexit has only made matters worse. Without stable retail sales and a surge in unfunded government spending over the past year, mostly to employ more civil servants to cope with Brexit, the UK would be in recession. Manufacturing, construction and the services sector all contracted last month at a speed that many economists found shocking. Boris Johnson may believe he is justified in hailing the strength of the UK economy as he seeks to shore up support for leaving the EU. Businesses would say otherwise. Across the Atlantic, Trump\u2019s inclination would be to ask Congress for more tax cuts to keep consumers happy. Friday\u2019s non-farm payroll numbers showed unemployment falling to a 50-year low and wages rising to keep consumers spending, despite job creation slowing markedly. Like their UK counterparts, US consumers have so far remained immune to talk of a recession. But Congress is in no mood to give the president anything at the moment \u2013 especially while an impeachment inquiry is in full flow. So the president turned instead to berating the US Federal Reserve into cutting interest rates, which acts like a tax giveaway for indebted consumers. With reluctance, the Fed has obliged twice this year. And it may do again before the year is out, though the pace of rate cuts is not fast enough for Trump. The president is aware that interest rate cuts have turned into a competitive game. Cuts by the Fed have merely kept pace with moves by the European Central Bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China and the Bank of Japan to ease credit and make it cheaper to borrow. The Bank of England is likely to be next. These moves limit the effect of US policymaking and rob Trump of his only mechanism to prevent the current slowdown accelerating into 2020 and his re-election year. It survived Deepwater, but BP is oblivious to the danger to us all Bob Dudley\u2019s legacy as boss of BP will be forever defined by the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon disaster and the slump in global oil prices only a few years later. The 64-year-old Texan, who announced his retirement last week, has had a tough decade at the top. The British oil and gas group recognises this. BP\u2019s chairman, Helge Lund, said with Nordic understatement that BP owed Dudley a \u201cdebt of gratitude\u201d for his work wresting control of a company which came close to collapse. But in paying tribute to the outgoing chief executive he is focusing on the wrong existential challenge. Lund is clear that BP overcame a fundamental threat to its survival in the wake of the Deepwater explosion, but the chairman could be accused of underestimating the terminal risk \u2013 to BP, as well as the planet \u2013 posed by the climate crisis. BP\u2019s chosen chief for a \u201ctransformational era\u201d is Bernard Looney, a former drilling engineer and the head of its exploration and production business. It is hardly a break from BP\u2019s oil-hungry past. His appointment was unveiled in the same week that the Royal Shakespeare Company severed ties with BP amid growing public outrage over oil company sponsorship. For an oil man who has worked in the North Sea, the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska, the current public climate may prove the most hostile of all.

Helarius Kisting - the player who until recently was still an amateur, before moving to Romania to chase his passion, cutting down a flying Jordie Barrett - 20kg+ his superior - with a courageous tackle. And yet the All Blacks came, and came again, and like the big bad wolf of the fairytales, eventually blew Namibia\u2019s house down.</p> <p>It was a tough, rugged, brave first thirty from the African minnows. More than that, though, it was disciplined, and it was smart. Carrying with ball-in-hand, not playing into the All Blacks hands by allowing flowing counter attacks. They earned good field position, and they took their points on offer. At 10-9 for just a glimmer, perhaps they even dared to dream.</p> <p>But 80 minutes is an age in professional rugby. Ask even tier one nations who hit 50 or 60 minutes against the All Blacks and still think they\u2019re in it (*coughs* Australia).</p> <p>Today Namibia managed 35-40 minutes. Next time, maybe they\u2019ll dream of 50. That\u2019s the mission, that\u2019s the goal, and it\u2019s why aspiring nations pit themselves against the best in the world.</p> <p>For their part, the ABs were uncharacteristically sloppy at times in the first half. Kicks into touch on the full, balls put to ground, and men yellow-carded for high shots.</p> <p>It was a different story after the break - as a 47-0 scoreline suggests. Plenty on NZ\u2019s fringes in the squad pushed their case for a first team jersey. Plenty showed why this is the deepest 31-player squad in world rugby.</p> <p>Steve Hansen grumbles and growls, but he knows his team are travelling nicely. And Brodie Retallick got through a solid 30 minutes unscathed too. It\u2019s building nicely for New Zealand. Watch out world (if you weren\u2019t already).</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d9993fd8f084ab8417337de\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-06T07:13:55.898Z\">8.13am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And here\u2019s the wrap from our eyes at the ground, Rob Kitson:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Not every inflated Rugby World Cup scoreline tells the full story and this was a prime example.<br></p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/06/all-blacks-brush-aside-brave-namibia-in-rugby-world-cup\">All Blacks brush aside brave Namibia in Rugby World Cup</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d99922a8f08fbb0c1721caa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-06T07:08:49.150Z\">8.08am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Now there is of course the matter of one more game of rugby before we head into tomorrow\u2019s rest day: Pool C action as France take on Tonga.

It\u2019s the special frisson that drives players to train, fans to talk all week with their friends about, and coaches to stay awake at night plotting the one-percenters.</p> <p>Except for Namibia vs New Zealand.</p> <p>This is a result as sure as anything. A result preordained. Predicted by Nostradamus some 450 years ago. It\u2019s one of Donald Rumsfeld\u2019s \u201cknown knowns\u201d.</p> <p>But this is largely beside the point. Within the battle that is a professional rugby match - especially one at a World Cup - are a thousand tiny battles. The first scrum. The first line out. The first driving maul. Contested high balls. Individual tackles. Metres carried.</p> <p>A handful of professional players will never beat the world\u2019s preeminent team - a unit galvanised by endemic success. Namibia are 0/21 at the World Cup, New Zealand are 30/30 in the group stage. And yet - the goal remains to win the little battles. Score a try. Force some turnovers. Any little victory may light a fire inside the heart of young Namibian players back home.</p> <p>Four years ago when these two sides met for the first time, it finished 58-14. The man who scored that day for Namibia, Johan Deysel, is now back as their captain. We\u2019ll find out shortly whether he can lift them to greater heights today.</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s a testament to how much any individual man with a thumping heart can play above themselves. Helarius Kisting - the player who until recently was still an amateur, before moving to Romania to chase his passion, cutting down a flying Jordie Barrett - 20kg+ his superior - with a courageous tackle. And yet the All Blacks came, and came again, and like the big bad wolf of the fairytales, eventually blew Namibia\u2019s house down. It was a tough, rugged, brave first thirty from the African minnows. More than that, though, it was disciplined, and it was smart. Carrying with ball-in-hand, not playing into the All Blacks hands by allowing flowing counter attacks. They earned good field position, and they took their points on offer. At 10-9 for just a glimmer, perhaps they even dared to dream. But 80 minutes is an age in professional rugby. Ask even tier one nations who hit 50 or 60 minutes against the All Blacks and still think they\u2019re in it (*coughs* Australia). Today Namibia managed 35-40 minutes. Next time, maybe they\u2019ll dream of 50. That\u2019s the mission, that\u2019s the goal, and it\u2019s why aspiring nations pit themselves against the best in the world. For their part, the ABs were uncharacteristically sloppy at times in the first half. Kicks into touch on the full, balls put to ground, and men yellow-carded for high shots. It was a different story after the break - as a 47-0 scoreline suggests. Plenty on NZ\u2019s fringes in the squad pushed their case for a first team jersey. Plenty showed why this is the deepest 31-player squad in world rugby. Steve Hansen grumbles and growls, but he knows his team are travelling nicely. And Brodie Retallick got through a solid 30 minutes unscathed too. It\u2019s building nicely for New Zealand. Watch out world (if you weren\u2019t already). And here\u2019s the wrap from our eyes at the ground, Rob Kitson: Not every inflated Rugby World Cup scoreline tells the full story and this was a prime example. Now there is of course the matter of one more game of rugby before we head into tomorrow\u2019s rest day: Pool C action as France take on Tonga. It could be a rugged first 20-30 to that one, if Tonga\u2019s on their game. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do with myself with no matches tomorrow. Go for a walk; commune with nature? Lifelong ABs supporter Ron Franklin\u2019s written in: All Blacks didn\u2019t give enough. Otherwise the score would have been 100+. Nice cruising game. We want more like 1995 AB\u2019s massive score against Japan. I witnessed that piece of history with a second AB team. Well done. Ooph. Harsh, our Ron. You have to give credit to Namibia for that first 30 minutes surely. Plus, maybe the tier two nations are a lot closer these days, hence the lack of 100+ results? And a reminder to our many readers from New Zealand: We are increasing our commitment to New Zealand readers by offering more stories every day about the key issues in New Zealand. We couldn\u2019t do this without the support of our generous readers. If you are a supporter, thank you. If you haven\u2019t yet contributed, please consider supporting our independent journalism. With an office in Sydney and New York it\u2019s an increasingly global coverage that the Guardian looks to offer. We\u2019d love to do more from NZ as well. Thanks for your support. Anton Lienert-Brown is named player of the match, in a host of very strong performances from All Blacks. A shot of Namibian coach Phil Davies, post-game. You can\u2019t imagine he would be too unhappy with what he saw from his side - especially in the first half. When the gong had sounded after 40, his side were only trailing 17-9. A run of 61 unanswered points though, a 47-0 second half, as the All Blacks went back to what they do best. 80 min: Barrett receives one final kickoff. They look to run past the gong, once again, the All Blacks. These seconds must be tortuous for the Namibians. But there\u2019s a ball to ground, and that\u2019s all she wrote! A second-half exhibition from New Zealand - that\u2019s much more like it. 78 min: Two huge steps from TJ Perenara, that was terrific work, he flicks out to George Bridge, who does well to stay in field, and has the replacement half got on the end of it?! We go upstairs for a TMO - has Perenara ground in the corner before going into touch? It\u2019s a sublime final flicked pass from Weber. What a try! Unlucky from Kisting, who did so brilliantly with the attempted covering tackle, but to no avail. And finally Barrett hooks one again. He\u2019d been on a nice run of conversions there. 76 min: New Zealand on the attack once again, Ioane goes hunting, before ALB gets the legs driving once again, and it\u2019s Jordie Barrett - he\u2019s deserved a try for his work this second half - and that\u2019s the ABs tenth of the game! Barrett converts his own try. 26 points for the game. 75 min: They build the phases but without any cut through, and it\u2019s a ball pinched by Jordie Barrett. They pump it up-field, and they\u2019ve pinned the fullback, who has little option but to concede a ball into touch. 73 min: So, an offensive lineout for the Namibians - they\u2019re about 10m out. They go wide, but there only forced back towards the 22m line. Quick hands wide, but again they can\u2019t get round the wall of black, even with the man advantage. 72 min: Fifteen phases - lovely stuff, and they\u2019ve earned the penalty. And they kick to touch! They\u2019re chasing the try, and why not. Great courage here, Namibia. We go to a TMO though, and Ofa Tuungafasi could be in trouble here, for a hit direct to the neck. A second yellow card! 70 min: That was a better ten minutes for Namibia. Now they have to find another big ten to close it. Frizell with a ball to ground, Kisting with a delightful ball back inside, but he\u2019s lined his own player up for heavy contact. Still, they build ten phases of play. This is good stuff. Another half-break, but again, they don\u2019t have the toe to get clear. 67 min: Here\u2019s Cane with a heavy contact into the line, and then terrific offloads from Matt Todd and then Anton Lienert-Brown with the flicked pass, and it\u2019s the fullback, Ben Smith who helps himself to a brace! A fine skillful move from the ABs. Jordie Barrett striking them nicely now, he knocks that one over. 66 min: A scrappy few moments as NZ leave it behind, before Van Jaarsveld puts one down! He was dreaming of glory, the hard-working Namibian hooker - he still had a few in black to beat, mind. 64 min: A loose ball, but well tidied up by Tromp. It\u2019s Venter with a great carry, but eventually Dane Coles leaps onto a loose ball, and they look to counter attack once again, NZ. 63 min: A relieving penalty for Namibia, as Frizzell contests the lineout throw illegally. They kick to touch and take the breather. They opt for the five-man lineout, and then a terrific carry out wide! Another line break, but the All Blacks recover. Such pace. It\u2019s Klim involved again, they\u2019re inside the NZ 22m line. The crowd comes to life, can we see a Namibian try? 61 min: Leslie Klim flies for an attempted intercept, but he\u2019s knocked it to ground, the Namibian winger. And if they thought their afternoon was getting easier, on comes Rieko Ioane. Expect him to be absolutely swarming for a five-pointer. 59 min: Oh wow. 89% possession this second half, New Zealand. That\u2019s why it\u2019s been such an uphill slug since the break. Unrelenting stuff from the world\u2019s pre-eminent rugby team. 57 min: A rare lineout feed now for Namibia. Can they settle. Try and find a little bit of rhythm, ball-in-hand. Barrett races out of the line and clatters the Namibian ball-carrier. No let up here, from the ABs. 54 min: They back knocking around the 22m, New Zealand. They haven\u2019t shown the same composure, Namibia, since the break. You can\u2019t really blame them, I guess. It\u2019s an eighth try, and it\u2019s skipper for the day, Whitelock who grabs it. He hits the base of the post. I don\u2019t love that rule; surely you always have to get across the line for the try? Call me old fashioned. Two more from Jordie Barrett. And injury to insult - as the skipper Johan Deysel heads off with an HIA assessment, but he\u2019s also got his arm in a sling. Let\u2019s hope that\u2019s not his tournament. 51 min: This is better stuff from the ABs. They run a deep line, plenty of decoys, plenty of well-time balls, and they isolate the flying winger Reece, one-on-one, and he finishes brilliantly inside his marker. Barrett\u2019s radar has improved as he\u2019s gone on. Another fine conversion from just inside the touchline. 50 min: Aaron Smith looks crossfield with the kick, but it\u2019s only Frizzell out wide and he can\u2019t beat the winger, Greyling to it. The Namibia winger stays down, though he\u2019s copped a nasty knock from the hip of Frizzell. And a penalty against Namibia, strong work, Ardie Savea. 48 min: As the bodies tire you get the sense there\u2019s only one way this match is going. A dropped ball, so a chance for some rare possession for Namibia, but they\u2019ve coughed it up straight away. The mental pressure is really starting to tell. 44 min: And now it\u2019s New Zealand on the attack again, after an exchange of kicks. Tromp\u2019s perhaps not that well considered - you just can\u2019t give the Kiwis the ball with no pressure on the kick. They pin the ears, Barrett is involved multiple times and it\u2019s good metres again from Goodhue, before ALB pops up in the corner. That\u2019s better from Barrett - he\u2019s slotted that one from near the touchline. 41 min: Yep, if there was a Hansen half-time dressing down, it\u2019s still stinging in their ears, the ABs. It\u2019s a big carry from Ta\u2019avao before the prop, Moody says, I\u2019ll have that. And Jordie Barrett adds the extras. Second half! And we\u2019re back. And it\u2019s early advantage ABs again, who set for a scrum. It\u2019s been one part of the game where the Namibians have really struggled. They just can\u2019t match NZ in the scrum. So. Your thoughts on that first stanza? Were the ABs letting them off a little, or did Namibia really just rise to the occasion? And that\u2019s all we have from the first half. A comfortable 15-pt lead in the end for the All Blacks, but gee, weren\u2019t they made to work for it? A terrific first forty from Namibia. I\u2019m not spinning this - they really were impressive. 40 + 4 min: It\u2019s a big scrum push, and it\u2019s Goodhue second runner off the shoulder of Jordie Barrett. And now the fullback, Ben Smith who darts through the gap! They weren\u2019t stopping the half until they\u2019d secured their bonus point, the ABs. That was almost torturous, the bonus 10% extra play for the tiring underdogs. And Barrett slots a second. And that\u2019s the extras. 40 + 2 min: Another infringement, and they call for another scrum, NZ. These Namibian forwards are sucking in some huge breaths. Can they survive this set piece? It\u2019s Savea, he\u2019s so dangerous. And it\u2019s another penalty against Namibia! Venter grabs the ball off feet. A warning from the referee - they don\u2019t want to lose a player for persistent infringements. 39 min: Oh my. Jordie Barrett looks for the jabbed kick down the flank, and he\u2019s put it directly into touch! Uncharacteristic errors from the ABs. And now a huge leg drive from the ABs following a turnover. They want one more try, you can tell. Pressure seconds this, for Namibia. Van Jaarsveld looks for the intercept! But it goes to ground. Sam Whitelock says let\u2019s have a scrum - no attempt at the three, they want another seven here. 37 min: Ooh, almost another ball pinched by Van Jaarsveld. But he\u2019s hurt his hand in the process. It\u2019s a scrum, and an NZ feed. This has been a fine performance from Namibia so far, but they need to do well the next few minutes. If they can hang on here, they\u2019ll go into the sheds very happy with the half, you\u2019d imagine. 34 min: As always though, having said that, we have a turnover, and again the ABs look instantly dangerous on the counter. Aaron Smith with quick ball, he looks to put Goodhue through. Another flat pass, and they\u2019re within a metre of the line. And it\u2019s Ta\u2019avao who crashes over! His first try in ABs colours. And from dead in front, the conversion is dispatched from Jordie Barrett. 1/3. 33 min: This is terrific stuff from Namibia. They\u2019re on the NZ 22m line, but what\u2019s impressed is how well they\u2019ve protected the ball on the carry. We saw yesterday Uruguay trying to play hard against the more fancied Wallabies, but there too many handling errors. Heart isn\u2019t enough at this level, you also need head, and that\u2019s where the Welwitschia have been very good so far. 32 min: And Brodie Retallick makes way. A momentary concern - you just pray nothing happens to the big man, but the word from the NZ bench is that that was a pre-arranged plan. A good half hour out, and he\u2019s come through unscathed. 31 min: Ach. Nasty moment - and it\u2019s a yellow card! Nepo Laulala collects Klim with a swinging arm direct to the head. He did realise his error straight away, the prop - and apologised to his opposite number. A tough call on the front rower, with the Namibian ball carrying stumbling into the tackle. Still, that\u2019s the directive, this tournament. How will they fare with 14, the All Blacks? 29 min: That one\u2019s straight as an arrow as well! Stevens. Can he show Jordie Barrett how it\u2019s done? A fine penalty shot. Okay, now\u2019s the big test. You can\u2019t imagine some of the more experienced ABs are going to stand for this. Watch for a big NZ lift over the next five minutes or so. 26 min: A decent box-kick from Namibia, it\u2019s well claimed by Barrett but the ball spills loose and they almost capitalise, the Africans! Great recovery from Ben Smith - still very quick, the veteran. But they\u2019re on the attack, Namibia. About 22m out, and they settle for another penalty shot, after Moody\u2019s infringement. They\u2019re playing like northern hemispherers, here! Another lovely strike from Stevens. Preventing kicks at one end, thumping them home at the other! It was 40m out, although more or less in front. But he navigates the wind well, and pops it right over the black dot. 24 min: They look to play, ball-in-hand, Namibia. They go through the phases, but don\u2019t quite make progress. We come back for an offside, called against Sam Cane for springing out of the defensive line. A close up of Steve Hansen. He\u2019s not giving much away, but you imagine he\u2019s not happy with one or two of the early sloppy concessions. 21 min: Yep, that\u2019s the challenge. How do you not let them have the ball? It\u2019s Ardie Savea who draws the attention of defenders before popping a pass back on the inside for ALB. He beats two or three would-be tacklers and hares for home. And a great distraction from Stevens - Barrett\u2019s absolutely duffed that conversion attempt, did the Namibian runner put him off? It almost bounced before the posts! Horrid effort. 19 min: Namibia will play around halfway - and there\u2019s another half-break, but the ball spills loose! The All Blacks again from broken play. Always a concern. Reece tries a chip and chase down the wing, but Greyling covers well and takes the grounding in goal. A 22m drop out, and they pump it deep into NZ territory. 17 min: Ach, bad news for Namibia - it was PJ Van Lill receiving attention, and he appears to have had to leave the field for good. A shame, he was one of their strongest performers early on. Johan Retief enters the play. 16 min: A pause in play as a big Namibian forward receives treatment for what appears to be a finger injury. It will be a lineout feed for the Africans, 15-20m out from their own line - a tricky one, they can\u2019t afford to lose it. They just hang on - before Retallick almost charges down the kick! What a willing worker he is. And the shoulder seems okay, so far too. 14 min: We set for a scrum - they need to stand strong here, Namibia. They\u2019ve already conceded a scrum penalty, giving up a 30-50kg weight advantage. We reset here, and they\u2019ve won it against the feed, the Kiwis. Now to launch an attack. 12 min: A relieving penalty against NZ, and we\u2019ve got a line break for Namibia! The big second rower, PJ Van Lill off a terrific popped pass. They\u2019re about 5m short, with Deysel on the end of it - surely not again! No, they\u2019ve hauled him down. And now a turnover. Credit the ABs defence. Imagine if they\u2019d gone over there. 10 min: Some impressive defence early on from Namibia - by and large they\u2019ve made their tackles and lined up the runners very well. Almost a turnover! But it dribbles back towards the ABs, and we all know how dangerous they are from broken play. 8 min: Namibia with the ball around halfway. Deysel takes the contact, but there\u2019s a penalty against the Africans for not releasing. Aaron Smith puts it quickly on the toe and rolls a grubber, but it just evades Reece and trickles into touch. 6 min: It\u2019s Jordie Barrett with the crossfield kick, and Sevu Reece stands up his one marker, and gets round in the corner. It was a great hit up from George Bridge that drew the attention of several defenders, thus creating the overlap. No extras from Jordie Barrett, who shanks it across the face. Goalkicking really has been almost the only blot in his near-perfect game. 4 min: Now the challenge is to keep it up, and from the restart there\u2019s an error. That\u2019s the kind of mistake they can\u2019t afford against New Zealand - we set for an scrum. And there\u2019s a scrum penalty and Jordie Barrett kicks to the corner. First lineout - what can they set up here, the ABs. That\u2019s a lovely strike from Damien Stevens. It\u2019s swirling, blustery conditions, and that was a long way out, and not far in from touchline. Can the Wallabies snap him up? What a start for the Africans! 2 min: A half-bust from the fullback Tromp, then some solid phases, before they win the first penalty of the match. The ABs pinged for not rolling away. 1 min: It\u2019s Namibia to kick us off. And how\u2019s that for a stat. The All Blacks haven\u2019t lost a World Cup game, this decade. Mental. Pascal Guazere is our man with the whistle. He gets us going and Jack Goodhue claims the kickoff around his 22m line. Jordie Barrett fires an early clearance, and now it\u2019s Namibia\u2019s first chance ball-in-hand. TJ Perenara. A heart the size of a blue whale. He leads the haka. It never ceases to send goosebumps that. One of the most iconic sights in World Rugby. And if that was daunting for the Namibians, wait til we kick off. Our players are out on the pitch, and it\u2019s anthem time. Aotearoa up first, and then \u201cNamibia, Land of the Brave\u201d. Their emblem is a tough desert flower, you don\u2019t imagine it\u2019s a place for the faint-hearted. And now - haka time. But to the team lists: Here\u2019s the All Blacks - and would you believe this is a so-called \u201cweakened\u201d team. With Whitelock and Retallick at second row and Ardie Savea at 8. Righto. A great story for big Brodie to make it back, just months after dislocating a shoulder. Let\u2019s hope he comes through unscathed. New Zealand: (15-1) 15 Ben Smith, 14 Sevu Reece, 13 Jack Goodhue, 12 Anton Lienert-Brown, 11 George Bridge, 10 Jordie Barrett, 9 Aaron Smith, 8 Ardie Savea, 7 Sam Cane, 6 Shannon Frizell, 5 Sam Whitelock (c), 4 Brodie Retallick, 3 Nepo Laulala, 2 Codie Taylor, 1 Joe Moody. Replacements: 16 Dane Coles, 17 Ofa Tu\u2019ungafasi, 18 Angus Ta\u2019avao, 19 Patrick Tuipulotu, 20 Matt Todd, 21 Brad Weber, 22 TJ Perenara, 23 Rieko Ioane. While for Namibia, would you believe they\u2019ve rested a few, to keep their powder dry for the clash with Canada? They\u2019ve still named eight that faced the ABs four years ago though. Namibia: 15 Johan Tromp, 14 Lesley Klim, 13 Justin Newman, 12 Johan Deysel (c), 11 JC Greyling, 10 Helarius Axasman Kisting, 9 Damian Stevens, 8 Janco Venter, 7 Thomasau Forbes, 6 Prince Gaoseb, 5 Tjiuee Uanivi, 4 PJ Van Lill, 3 AJ De Klerk, 2 Torsten van Jaarsveld, 1 Andre Rademeyer. Replacements: 16 Obert Nortj\u00e9, 17 Nelius Theron, 18 Aranos Coetzee, 19 Johan Retief, 20 Adriaan Booysen, 21 Eugene Jantjies, 22 Darryl De La Harpe, 23 Janry du Toit. And just to get you in the mood, Iwi: Tu meke. Now if you\u2019re here for the All Blacks and don\u2019t know too much about Namibian rugby, here\u2019s a good little backgrounder, prepared pre-tournament: And if you missed the write-ups of yesterday\u2019s games here\u2019s Robert Kitson\u2019s take on a feisty England v Argentina clash: The word from Reuters on Japan v Samoa: And John Davidson on Australia v Uruguay: Kia ora! Howzit! Best of greetings to you in windy Wellington or Windhoek, or indeed from wherever it is you\u2019re following our coverage today. Broken down in a 70s Corolla on the Albanian border and using your last data to keep tabs on the rugby instead? Drop us an email or tweet to get involved. We always love to hear from you. (Except for when it\u2019s about my spelling mistakes). The beauty of sport is that any team, on any day, can in often extraordinary circumstances, produce a miracle. It\u2019s the special frisson that drives players to train, fans to talk all week with their friends about, and coaches to stay awake at night plotting the one-percenters. Except for Namibia vs New Zealand. This is a result as sure as anything. A result preordained. Predicted by Nostradamus some 450 years ago. It\u2019s one of Donald Rumsfeld\u2019s \u201cknown knowns\u201d. But this is largely beside the point. Within the battle that is a professional rugby match - especially one at a World Cup - are a thousand tiny battles. The first scrum. The first line out. The first driving maul. Contested high balls. Individual tackles. Metres carried. A handful of professional players will never beat the world\u2019s preeminent team - a unit galvanised by endemic success. Namibia are 0/21 at the World Cup, New Zealand are 30/30 in the group stage. And yet - the goal remains to win the little battles. Score a try. Force some turnovers. Any little victory may light a fire inside the heart of young Namibian players back home. Four years ago when these two sides met for the first time, it finished 58-14. The man who scored that day for Namibia, Johan Deysel, is now back as their captain. We\u2019ll find out shortly whether he can lift them to greater heights today.",

      "body": "<p><strong>What are the main points of Boris Johnson\u2019s plan?</strong><br>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/03/eu-parliament-boris-johnson-brexit-plan-not-remotely-acceptable\" title=\"\">PM\u2019s proposals</a> would leave Northern Ireland aligned with the EU\u2019s single market, so there would be no need for regulatory checks when goods cross into the Republic of Ireland. Northern Ireland\u2019s assembly would be given a vote on sticking to EU regulations every four years. Northern Ireland would leave the EU\u2019s customs union, its tariff-free trading area. The government claims that most customs issues could be dealt with electronically, with a small number of physical customs checks done well away from the border. It says that the measures would avoid the need for a hard border in Ireland, which has been the main Brexit deal stumbling block.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/06/boris-johnson-brexit-proposals-border-northern-ireland-fermanagh\">Border talk stirs up bad memories in Northern Ireland</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>How is this different </strong><strong>from May\u2019s</strong>?<br>The deal proposed by Theresa May included the so-called \u201cIrish backstop\u201d \u2013 a fallback measure designed to avoid any hard border becoming necessary on the island of Ireland. Unlike in Johnson\u2019s plan, Northern Ireland would remain aligned to EU regulations and inside its customs union. To deal with complaints from Democratic Unionist party MPs that the measure would separate Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK, May agreed that the UK would also remain inside the EU customs union. However, the DUP and pro-Brexit MPs still objected.</p> <p><strong>Under Johnson\u2019s plan, what happens to goods going from Britain to Northern Ireland, and then to Ireland?</strong><br>Goods would be checked between Britain and Northern Ireland to ensure they comply with EU standards. They would then be checked again to ensure they comply with customs rules between Northern Ireland and Ireland. Johnson wants this done electronically and through checks once the goods arrive at their final destination, but details are sketchy.</p> <p><strong>Who compromised here?</strong><br>The plan gives Tory Brexiters what they want.

      "bodyText": "What are the main points of Boris Johnson\u2019s plan? The PM\u2019s proposals would leave Northern Ireland aligned with the EU\u2019s single market, so there would be no need for regulatory checks when goods cross into the Republic of Ireland. Northern Ireland\u2019s assembly would be given a vote on sticking to EU regulations every four years. Northern Ireland would leave the EU\u2019s customs union, its tariff-free trading area. The government claims that most customs issues could be dealt with electronically, with a small number of physical customs checks done well away from the border. It says that the measures would avoid the need for a hard border in Ireland, which has been the main Brexit deal stumbling block. How is this different from May\u2019s? The deal proposed by Theresa May included the so-called \u201cIrish backstop\u201d \u2013 a fallback measure designed to avoid any hard border becoming necessary on the island of Ireland. Unlike in Johnson\u2019s plan, Northern Ireland would remain aligned to EU regulations and inside its customs union. To deal with complaints from Democratic Unionist party MPs that the measure would separate Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK, May agreed that the UK would also remain inside the EU customs union. However, the DUP and pro-Brexit MPs still objected. Under Johnson\u2019s plan, what happens to goods going from Britain to Northern Ireland, and then to Ireland? Goods would be checked between Britain and Northern Ireland to ensure they comply with EU standards. They would then be checked again to ensure they comply with customs rules between Northern Ireland and Ireland. Johnson wants this done electronically and through checks once the goods arrive at their final destination, but details are sketchy. Who compromised here? The plan gives Tory Brexiters what they want. Britain would be outside the EU\u2019s single market and customs union. It is the DUP that has compromised. It once vowed to oppose any additional checks between Northern Ireland and Britain. But the Johnson plan effectively places a regulatory border for goods and food between the two. The DUP appears to have agreed because the plan hands Northern Ireland bags of money \u2013 and gives the Northern Ireland assembly a vote on the deal every four years. The DUP has an effective veto in the assembly. What are the EU objections? The most problematic elements relate to customs. Johnson proposes the use of technology, a streamlined system, exemptions for small companies and schemes for trusted companies. He also proposes that any physical checks could be done at businesses or \u201cdesignated locations\u201d. The EU is being asked to make big concessions and is not sure the plans are workable. It also supports Dublin\u2019s concern that, in practice, the plan would require new customs posts. The power handed to the Northern Ireland assembly to tear up key parts of the settlement is also problematic. Will the plans be accepted? They are a non-starter with the EU, which is demanding changes before the plans can be discussed as the basis of a possible deal. Will the Commons pass them? With the DUP and pro-Brexit MPs back onside, it is possible that Johnson could secure a majority for the plans as long as former Tory rebels and enough Labour MPs opted to back them. But the dilemma has always been that a hard Brexit plan capable of securing a majority in the Commons would not be acceptable to the EU. In that regard, nothing has changed. What happens next? The pretence of talks may limp on for a week, but without any further concessions from Downing Street there is no prospect of progress.

Their collection of amateurs and journeymen pros \u2013 the lineup included farmers, a bank worker and a dentist \u2013 certainly did Namibia proud, playing with more pace, intent and accuracy than many of their supposed peers. For just over three minutes the lowest-ranked side in the World Cup led the winners of the last two editions on the scoreboard and were still just 10-9 down heading towards half-time. In the diminutive shape of their creative fly-half Helarius Kisting and their even smaller No 9, Damian Stevens, one of the smoothest passers here, they had a splendid half-back pairing and Stevens proved equally impressive off the tee, nailing three penalties as the referee Pascal Ga\u00fcz\u00e8re showed New Zealand little mercy at the breakdown. Hopefully all those who say rugby\u2019s smaller nations are unworthy of the biggest stage were watching. Sadly for the romantics it could not last indefinitely. Despite a four-day turnaround, two props, Nepo Laulala and Ofa Tu\u2019ungafasi, being shown yellow cards for clumsy challenges and the returning Brodie Retallick lasting just 30 minutes, the All Blacks remain the most ruthless team in the world at picking off tiring opposition. A try apiece from the replacement Angus Ta\u2019avao and the full-back Ben Smith, added to earlier scores from Sevu Reece and Anton Lienert-Brown, put them 24-9 ahead at the interval and thereafter it was one-way traffic. Smith, Reece and Lienert-Brown all ended up with two tries and there were more for Joe Moody, Sam Whitelock, Jordie Barrett and the flying Perenara as the forwards ruthlessly raised the tempo. Barrett, pressed into service at 10, finished with 21 points, something to tuck up his sleeve when things get competitive around the family dinner table. Namibia, though, never lay down even after the departure of their hard-tackling captain Johan Deysel, known as \u201cBuffy\u201d to his teammates because of his reputation for slaying opponents. Deysel scored his side\u2019s only try against the All Blacks in the corresponding fixture in 2015 at what is now the London Stadium when the final score was 58-14 but Phil Davies, their soon-to-depart coach, felt this display was still a step up. \u201cWe\u2019re very proud of the players and the effort we put in,\u201d said the former Wales international, whose side made more clean breaks than South Africa did against the same opposition on the opening weekend. \u201cThe scoreboard looks a bit painful but in terms of the performance there\u2019s lots to take out of that match.\u201d The last time Namibia beat a tier-one nation was 28 years ago \u2013 they defeated Ireland 26-15 in Windhoek in 1991 \u2013 but, on this evidence, they are an improving side who should run Canada close in their final Pool B fixture on Sunday. New Zealand, meanwhile, plan to give Retallick 60 minutes in their final pool outing against Italy on Saturday so he is fully up to speed for the knockout stages. Hansen particularly enjoyed Perenara\u2019s try \u2013 \u201cIt got me out of my seat and not many things do that\u201d \u2013 but this game also reinforced his belief that one fractionally misjudged tackle could yet influence the outcome of bigger games in the knockout stages. He said: \u201cI think the two yellow cards today were fair under the guidelines but it is tough when players are falling. There are going to be times when you make a connection and I\u2019m not sure how you avoid that. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t use your arms you\u2019re going to get done for a no-arms tackle. Each team is doing their best but there will be circumstances that are just about unavoidable. Unfortunately that\u2019s just where our game is at the moment.\u201d \u2022 We are expanding our coverage of New Zealand. Please help us by supporting our independent journalism",

      "body": "<p>Making a building is such a big thing. They impact people for generations and act as massive transfers of information. It\u2019s very profound. You can\u2019t think enough about what the responsibility is. And, yes, I know this way of thinking makes it overly torturous for myself \u2013 even my team think that. But buildings are not background for me. It\u2019s not a nine-to-five thing, my eyes are always looking and I always have an opinion on the buildings around me. Luckily my wife is able to giggle with me about it.</p> <p>It\u2019s important to understand root sources in architecture. I\u2019m fascinated by memory in my work now, but it\u2019s something that happened incidentally at first. It started when I was asked to work on the <a href=\"https://www.stephenlawrence.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Stephen Lawrence Centre in 2007</a> and deal with the idea of a tragic and traumatic issue, but also create a memorial for this young boy and an educational centre for Lewisham, south London.</p> <p>In a strange way, the <a href=\"https://autograph.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Rivington Place</a> arts centre in London also had an idea of embedding the archive of <a href=\"http://stuarthallfoundation.org/professor-stuart-hall-2/obituaries/professor-stuart-hall-sociologist-and-pioneer-in-the-field-of-cultural-studies-whose-work-explored-the-concept-of-britishness/\" title=\"\">Professor Stuart Hall</a>. It was an indirect homage to this political activist and social theorist\u2019s incredible legacy and his role as the founding chair of the Institute of International Visual Arts. My work draws me in that direction. I\u2019m attracted to the new or emerging institutions that in 50 or 100 years will be formed, but the architecture that frames these 21st-century institutions is an opportunity to help shape and be part of that language.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"552e2d469a759e49e6c1eb270a9c6ef545dd5d48\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/552e2d469a759e49e6c1eb270a9c6ef545dd5d48/0_0_5928_7904/750.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I spend a lot of time at the start of a project listening and absorbing and visiting\u2019: David Adjaye.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I spend a lot of time at the start of a project listening and absorbing and visiting\u2019: David Adjaye.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Josh Huskin, courtesy of Ruby City and Adjaye Associates</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some people say you don\u2019t need any more physical memorials because the internet archives everything, but I think architecture has a role in editing and presenting that knowledge in building form as new monuments. It\u2019s important to be able to synthesise ideas and give them a quality that creates an engagement and usefulness with people. </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.rubycity.org\" title=\"\">Linda Pace Foundation</a> art centre, Ruby City, which opens this month in Texas, is another example of how place and history are always important. <a href=\"https://www.rubycity.org/linda/\" title=\"\">Linda </a> was an artist and philanthropist, and she bought the site for the gallery with a prewar ice house on it.and sShe came to see Rivington Place and thought I\u2019d be the perfect young architect to work with. She had cancer and it had just become aggressive. She knew she was starting to go down. She became fascinated with dreams and their interpretation. She started drawing a lot of crabs, which are apparently synonymous with the idea of cancer attacking the body. Then she drew this place she called Ruby City. Her drawing looks like a shining city on a hill or a Russian Orthodox church. For her it was a vessel, a hope. She\u2019d had a tragic end - her 24-year-old son died, she had cancer \u2013 but had a hope thatthat her disappearance would have an impact. </p> <p>I became fascinated by it. Red had become so important to her and I wanted to use that as a start point. From discussions we had, I looked at San Antonio and the missionaries who came to the region and the structures they built, the incredible monasteries. I also looked at pre-colonisation America and Mesoamerican culture and their relationship to making architecture out of mud and raising these incredible citadels all over that part of Texas and New Mexico. The commonality for me between the monasteries and citadels is that they\u2019re both about religion but also about death and communing with the afterlife \u2013 and they\u2019re habitation spaces. Those ideas, mixed with her idea of the form, became an idea about architecture articulating light as a revealer of different facets of her art collection. </p> <p>What was very beautiful to me was that, though the soil on the site is more brown than red, it has a very high iron content. When you go into New Mexico there are these areas where the soil is a beautiful red, so that was another way to connect to the precolonial architecture. Though the precolonial architecture wasn\u2019t about light, the monasteries were in the high clefts and had beautiful vaulted rooms. </p> <p>So there were different layers that made a way to think about a space that would support her diverse art collection but also is about how we use light and view and history. So the Ruby City building is about Linda, Texas and the collection.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"248c36a0494427efc0486b9f46daf61f82da90ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/248c36a0494427efc0486b9f46daf61f82da90ad/0_466_7952_4771/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I prefer building for communities.

Now I have a research team, so they put together histories for me to dive into. Until I have that clarity I can\u2019t really draw. I have to have a \u201cfusion moment\u201d and tell the story the way I have read it in my presentations to clients. If that has resonance, we get the job \u2013 and if it doesn\u2019t, well, we don\u2019t.</p> <p>I prefer building for communities \u2013 with individuals it\u2019s hit and miss. A house is a tough thing. People think I do a lot of houses, but I don\u2019t. I do private spaces for writers and artists, which have a specific function. A home is so loaded with issues that it\u2019s really hard for me to do. Engaging with a community is easier, a public board has a responsibility to the world they are building for. You don\u2019t get that with a house. I\u2019ve found that artists have incredible empathy with my process \u2013 my most successful projects have all been with artists such as Sue Webster. </p> <p>Hopefully it\u2019s a little early to think how I\u2019ll be remembered myself. But as someone whose ideas were important enough to be brought into form would be just fine. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Making a building is such a big thing. They impact people for generations and act as massive transfers of information. It\u2019s very profound. You can\u2019t think enough about what the responsibility is. And, yes, I know this way of thinking makes it overly torturous for myself \u2013 even my team think that. But buildings are not background for me. It\u2019s not a nine-to-five thing, my eyes are always looking and I always have an opinion on the buildings around me. Luckily my wife is able to giggle with me about it. It\u2019s important to understand root sources in architecture. I\u2019m fascinated by memory in my work now, but it\u2019s something that happened incidentally at first. It started when I was asked to work on the Stephen Lawrence Centre in 2007 and deal with the idea of a tragic and traumatic issue, but also create a memorial for this young boy and an educational centre for Lewisham, south London. In a strange way, the Rivington Place arts centre in London also had an idea of embedding the archive of Professor Stuart Hall. It was an indirect homage to this political activist and social theorist\u2019s incredible legacy and his role as the founding chair of the Institute of International Visual Arts. My work draws me in that direction. I\u2019m attracted to the new or emerging institutions that in 50 or 100 years will be formed, but the architecture that frames these 21st-century institutions is an opportunity to help shape and be part of that language. Some people say you don\u2019t need any more physical memorials because the internet archives everything, but I think architecture has a role in editing and presenting that knowledge in building form as new monuments. It\u2019s important to be able to synthesise ideas and give them a quality that creates an engagement and usefulness with people. The Linda Pace Foundation art centre, Ruby City, which opens this month in Texas, is another example of how place and history are always important. Linda was an artist and philanthropist, and she bought the site for the gallery with a prewar ice house on it.and sShe came to see Rivington Place and thought I\u2019d be the perfect young architect to work with. She had cancer and it had just become aggressive. She knew she was starting to go down. She became fascinated with dreams and their interpretation. She started drawing a lot of crabs, which are apparently synonymous with the idea of cancer attacking the body. Then she drew this place she called Ruby City. Her drawing looks like a shining city on a hill or a Russian Orthodox church. For her it was a vessel, a hope. She\u2019d had a tragic end - her 24-year-old son died, she had cancer \u2013 but had a hope thatthat her disappearance would have an impact. I became fascinated by it. Red had become so important to her and I wanted to use that as a start point. From discussions we had, I looked at San Antonio and the missionaries who came to the region and the structures they built, the incredible monasteries. I also looked at pre-colonisation America and Mesoamerican culture and their relationship to making architecture out of mud and raising these incredible citadels all over that part of Texas and New Mexico. The commonality for me between the monasteries and citadels is that they\u2019re both about religion but also about death and communing with the afterlife \u2013 and they\u2019re habitation spaces. Those ideas, mixed with her idea of the form, became an idea about architecture articulating light as a revealer of different facets of her art collection. What was very beautiful to me was that, though the soil on the site is more brown than red, it has a very high iron content. When you go into New Mexico there are these areas where the soil is a beautiful red, so that was another way to connect to the precolonial architecture. Though the precolonial architecture wasn\u2019t about light, the monasteries were in the high clefts and had beautiful vaulted rooms. So there were different layers that made a way to think about a space that would support her diverse art collection but also is about how we use light and view and history. So the Ruby City building is about Linda, Texas and the collection. I spend a lot of time at the start of a project listening and absorbing and visiting. Now I have a research team, so they put together histories for me to dive into. Until I have that clarity I can\u2019t really draw. I have to have a \u201cfusion moment\u201d and tell the story the way I have read it in my presentations to clients. If that has resonance, we get the job \u2013 and if it doesn\u2019t, well, we don\u2019t. I prefer building for communities \u2013 with individuals it\u2019s hit and miss. A house is a tough thing. People think I do a lot of houses, but I don\u2019t. I do private spaces for writers and artists, which have a specific function. A home is so loaded with issues that it\u2019s really hard for me to do. Engaging with a community is easier, a public board has a responsibility to the world they are building for. You don\u2019t get that with a house. I\u2019ve found that artists have incredible empathy with my process \u2013 my most successful projects have all been with artists such as Sue Webster. Hopefully it\u2019s a little early to think how I\u2019ll be remembered myself. But as someone whose ideas were important enough to be brought into form would be just fine.",

      "body": "<p>While Michael Kiwanuka was making his second album, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/17/michael-kiwanuka-love-hate-album-review\" title=\"\">Love &amp; Hate</a></em>, a few years ago, the 10-minute opening track, Cold Little Heart, was his nemesis. Every time it reappeared on the studio schedule, his heart sank. So he was gratified when, in 2016, he learned that this hard-won song would appear in a new HBO miniseries called <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/big-little-lies\" title=\"\">Big Little Lies</a></em>.

He signed to Polydor and pipped Frank Ocean to pole position in the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/soundof/2012/\" title=\"\">BBC\u2019s Sound of 2012 poll</a>. His rootsy, reassuring debut album, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/mar/11/michael-kiwanuka-home-again-review\" title=\"\">Home Again</a></em>, went gold. But then self-doubt returned with a vengeance. Invited to join the sessions for Kanye West\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jun/17/kanye-west-yeezus-review\" title=\"\">Yeezus</a></em>, he felt intimidated and inadequate (\u201cReally he just wanted me to be me\u201d) and eventually sloped out. Discouraged by an unsympathetic A&amp;R man, he scrapped an entire second album, <em>Night Songs</em>. \u201cI was kind of lost,\u201d he says now. \u201cI was thinking of giving up. You get to the point where you\u2019ll try anything.\u201d</p> <p>The result, recorded with new producer Inflo, was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TYlcVNI2AM\" title=\"\">Black Man in a White World</a>, a song about not fitting in set to a handclap rhythm inspired by the bluesman Son House. \u201cI was like, nobody\u2019s going to listen to this but let\u2019s just do it.\u201d That demo was what hooked Danger Mouse, Grammy-winning producer for the likes of U2, the Black Keys, Gorillaz and Beck. Kiwanuka usually finds that he is at his most successful when he least expects it. \u201cThe benefit of nobody caring about you is you come up with your best stuff. You\u2019re free.\u201d He smiles. \u201cObviously at the time I didn\u2019t see it like that.\u201d</p> <p><em>Love &amp; Hate</em> rose to No 1 on a tide of unanimous acclaim and is widely considered one of the decade\u2019s classic albums. As well as <em>Big Little Lies</em>, Kiwanuka\u2019s songs have popped up in <em>Atlanta</em>, <em>Empire</em> and <em>When They See Us</em>, while the man himself made a cameo appearance in Danny Boyle\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/29/yesterday-review-danny-boyle-richard-curtis-the-beatles-himesh-patel\" title=\"\">Yesterday</a></em>. He noticed other encouraging signs. More prestigious artists were watching his festival sets from the side of the stage. His meetings at the record label were no longer scheduled for the end of the day. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like scoring a hat-trick in school,\u201d he says. \u201cYou get this kudos around the playground.\u201d</p> <p>Surely all of this did wonders for his confidence?</p> <p>\u201cYeeeah,\u201d he says hesitantly. Really? \u201cYes and no.\u201d Insecurity is cunning and insidious. Having failed without Danger Mouse and Inflo, he wondered if he owed all his success to them. \u201cI was definitely more confident outwardly but in the studio I would cower: Somebody\u2019s going to find me out. Without the superheroes I\u2019m rubbish.\u201d</p> <p>As he recorded <em>Kiwanuka</em> in London, New York and Los Angeles, he didn\u2019t just conquer this anxiety but made it the theme of a record that is even more extraordinary than <em>Love &amp; Hate</em>: a heavy soul masterpiece with traces of Gil Scott-Heron, Marvin Gaye, Donny Hathaway, David Axelrod and DJ Shadow. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yEeF65NnyI\" title=\"\">You Ain\u2019t the Problem</a>, the joyful first track, is both an encouraging message to listeners and a memo to himself. \u201cI got tired of impostor syndrome and self-doubt,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m living my dream. I\u2019m in the room. And I was wasting it with thoughts of inferiority. I\u2019ve always had that annoying [inner] voice and after 30 years you\u2019re like, \u2018Shut up, I\u2019ve had enough of this\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>The album title is an emphatic statement about self-acceptance. Muswell Hill is an overwhelmingly white area of north London, and at school Kiwanuka would dread new teachers reading the register for the first time because he\u2019d always have to correct them. When he visited family in Uganda, where it\u2019s pronounced Chi-wa-nuka, people would disapprove of the anglicised Kiwa-nu-ka. \u201cEverywhere I went it was wrong.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a3c7fb086157a506d7956e5979055b6eff36f4b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3c7fb086157a506d7956e5979055b6eff36f4b1/0_52_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kiwanuka performing at End of the Road festival in August.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kiwanuka performing at End of the Road festival in August.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Burak \u00c7\u0131ng\u0131/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These memories resurfaced when he signed to Polydor and was asked if he wanted to adopt a stage name. Kiwanuka, it was suggested, was hard to say and might give the impression that he was a world music artist. \u201cIt really pissed me off,\u201d he says. \u201cIt reminded me of being seven at the back of the class.\u201d <em>Kiwanuka</em>\u2019s title, wedded to a regal portrait by the Atlanta artist Markeidric Walker, is his belated \u201cprotest\u201d. It helps, he says, that the world has changed in the past decade. \u201cNobody would dream of saying that now. Now it\u2019s cool to be from Africa and have a difficult name. But back then it was just another thing to make me potentially ashamed of who I am.\u201d</p> <p>Kiwanuka\u2019s relationship with his name symbolises the sense of unbelonging that he described in Black Man in a White World. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel represented in black culture and definitely not in middle-class white culture,\u201d he says of growing up. \u201cWhen I saw an image of Bill Withers or Isaac Hayes or Hendrix I could relate to that. That\u2019s what gave me the courage to play.\u201d At university, he wrote an essay about artists such as Leadbelly and Ray Charles who blurred the artificial distinction between black and white music. \u201cI found it such an encouraging thing, looking back and finding people who felt like comrades.\u201d One of the only contemporary musicians who represented that same freedom was Danger Mouse. \u201cI thought, when I grow up I want to be like this guy. That\u2019s me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"98cdbb1c484806586b47cbbf83bd23e082030e5e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98cdbb1c484806586b47cbbf83bd23e082030e5e/1122_0_4911_4912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Kiwanuka\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018People need imperfection, they need grain, they need out-of-tune notes.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So far, Kiwanuka\u2019s concert audiences have been as white as Muswell Hill, but he hopes to reach more people like him. \u201cSome artists are singing to their people and I don\u2019t know who mine are. I\u2019m jealous when I see the way people from Brooklyn talk about Jay-Z: \u2018That\u2019s my guy.\u2019 I\u2019ve never had that. I don\u2019t think I ever will. I\u2019m not representing anyone. I wrestle with that because there\u2019s nothing like being part of a community.\u201d Then again, he sometimes meets artists who envy his freedom from the expectation to represent. He thinks that identity is \u2013 and should be \u2013 complicated.</p> <p>Accustomed to being an outsider, Kiwanuka is surprised to find himself less anomalous than ever. He has always been an analogue soul in a digital world but he no longer sees himself tagged as retro. From rappers sporting bushy beards to R&amp;B artists making idiosyncratic, hitless concept albums, he sees evidence of an aesthetic that is less slick, more sprawling, and defiantly imperfect. Even the tense political climate feels simpatico with the spirit of 1970s soul: \u201cRaw music for raw times.\u201d So his decision to conceive <em>Kiwanuka</em> as four sides of vinyl, strung together by instrumental interludes and sampled memories of civil rights sit-ins doesn\u2019t feel at all like an eccentric throwback.</p> <p>An amateur analogue photographer, Kiwanuka compares the album format to a Kodak camera. \u201cIt was meant to die but humans brought it back. People need that tactile reality. They need imperfection, they need grain, they need out-of-tune notes, they need vinyl that wears out, they need paint that looks old that you buy from posh shops. It\u2019s a reaction against this fast-paced, throwaway, machine-led world. It keeps us feeling alive.\u201d Better that, he says, than Instagram\u2019s cult of perfection. \u201cSocial media is something I really worry about because none of it is true. I think it\u2019s going to affect our resilience. Life isn\u2019t easy. If we\u2019re worrying about not being perfect, we\u2019re going to really struggle.\u201d</p> <p>Thus the sound of the album chimes with its theme of accepting his name, his identity, and his flaws. \u201cI\u2019m not perfect but neither is he or she,\u201d he sums up. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p> <p>Kiwanuka gathers his shopping bags to get the train to Southampton. He\u2019s back in London tomorrow for a radio session. The song he\u2019s been asked to play, he says with an amiable shrug, is Cold Little Heart.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.michaelkiwanuka.com/\" title=\"\">Kiwanuka is out 1 November on Polydor</a></em></p>",

You\u2019re free.\u201d He smiles. \u201cObviously at the time I didn\u2019t see it like that.\u201d Love &amp; Hate rose to No 1 on a tide of unanimous acclaim and is widely considered one of the decade\u2019s classic albums. As well as Big Little Lies, Kiwanuka\u2019s songs have popped up in Atlanta, Empire and When They See Us, while the man himself made a cameo appearance in Danny Boyle\u2019s Yesterday. He noticed other encouraging signs. More prestigious artists were watching his festival sets from the side of the stage. His meetings at the record label were no longer scheduled for the end of the day. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like scoring a hat-trick in school,\u201d he says. \u201cYou get this kudos around the playground.\u201d Surely all of this did wonders for his confidence? \u201cYeeeah,\u201d he says hesitantly. Really? \u201cYes and no.\u201d Insecurity is cunning and insidious. Having failed without Danger Mouse and Inflo, he wondered if he owed all his success to them. \u201cI was definitely more confident outwardly but in the studio I would cower: Somebody\u2019s going to find me out. Without the superheroes I\u2019m rubbish.\u201d As he recorded Kiwanuka in London, New York and Los Angeles, he didn\u2019t just conquer this anxiety but made it the theme of a record that is even more extraordinary than Love &amp; Hate: a heavy soul masterpiece with traces of Gil Scott-Heron, Marvin Gaye, Donny Hathaway, David Axelrod and DJ Shadow. You Ain\u2019t the Problem, the joyful first track, is both an encouraging message to listeners and a memo to himself. \u201cI got tired of impostor syndrome and self-doubt,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m living my dream. I\u2019m in the room. And I was wasting it with thoughts of inferiority. I\u2019ve always had that annoying [inner] voice and after 30 years you\u2019re like, \u2018Shut up, I\u2019ve had enough of this\u2019.\u201d The album title is an emphatic statement about self-acceptance. Muswell Hill is an overwhelmingly white area of north London, and at school Kiwanuka would dread new teachers reading the register for the first time because he\u2019d always have to correct them. When he visited family in Uganda, where it\u2019s pronounced Chi-wa-nuka, people would disapprove of the anglicised Kiwa-nu-ka. \u201cEverywhere I went it was wrong.\u201d These memories resurfaced when he signed to Polydor and was asked if he wanted to adopt a stage name. Kiwanuka, it was suggested, was hard to say and might give the impression that he was a world music artist. \u201cIt really pissed me off,\u201d he says. \u201cIt reminded me of being seven at the back of the class.\u201d Kiwanuka\u2019s title, wedded to a regal portrait by the Atlanta artist Markeidric Walker, is his belated \u201cprotest\u201d. It helps, he says, that the world has changed in the past decade. \u201cNobody would dream of saying that now. Now it\u2019s cool to be from Africa and have a difficult name. But back then it was just another thing to make me potentially ashamed of who I am.\u201d Kiwanuka\u2019s relationship with his name symbolises the sense of unbelonging that he described in Black Man in a White World. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel represented in black culture and definitely not in middle-class white culture,\u201d he says of growing up. \u201cWhen I saw an image of Bill Withers or Isaac Hayes or Hendrix I could relate to that. That\u2019s what gave me the courage to play.\u201d At university, he wrote an essay about artists such as Leadbelly and Ray Charles who blurred the artificial distinction between black and white music. \u201cI found it such an encouraging thing, looking back and finding people who felt like comrades.\u201d One of the only contemporary musicians who represented that same freedom was Danger Mouse. \u201cI thought, when I grow up I want to be like this guy. That\u2019s me.\u201d So far, Kiwanuka\u2019s concert audiences have been as white as Muswell Hill, but he hopes to reach more people like him. \u201cSome artists are singing to their people and I don\u2019t know who mine are. I\u2019m jealous when I see the way people from Brooklyn talk about Jay-Z: \u2018That\u2019s my guy.\u2019 I\u2019ve never had that. I don\u2019t think I ever will. I\u2019m not representing anyone. I wrestle with that because there\u2019s nothing like being part of a community.\u201d Then again, he sometimes meets artists who envy his freedom from the expectation to represent. He thinks that identity is \u2013 and should be \u2013 complicated. Accustomed to being an outsider, Kiwanuka is surprised to find himself less anomalous than ever. He has always been an analogue soul in a digital world but he no longer sees himself tagged as retro. From rappers sporting bushy beards to R&amp;B artists making idiosyncratic, hitless concept albums, he sees evidence of an aesthetic that is less slick, more sprawling, and defiantly imperfect. Even the tense political climate feels simpatico with the spirit of 1970s soul: \u201cRaw music for raw times.\u201d So his decision to conceive Kiwanuka as four sides of vinyl, strung together by instrumental interludes and sampled memories of civil rights sit-ins doesn\u2019t feel at all like an eccentric throwback. An amateur analogue photographer, Kiwanuka compares the album format to a Kodak camera. \u201cIt was meant to die but humans brought it back. People need that tactile reality. They need imperfection, they need grain, they need out-of-tune notes, they need vinyl that wears out, they need paint that looks old that you buy from posh shops. It\u2019s a reaction against this fast-paced, throwaway, machine-led world. It keeps us feeling alive.\u201d Better that, he says, than Instagram\u2019s cult of perfection. \u201cSocial media is something I really worry about because none of it is true. I think it\u2019s going to affect our resilience. Life isn\u2019t easy. If we\u2019re worrying about not being perfect, we\u2019re going to really struggle.\u201d Thus the sound of the album chimes with its theme of accepting his name, his identity, and his flaws. \u201cI\u2019m not perfect but neither is he or she,\u201d he sums up. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Kiwanuka gathers his shopping bags to get the train to Southampton. He\u2019s back in London tomorrow for a radio session. The song he\u2019s been asked to play, he says with an amiable shrug, is Cold Little Heart. Kiwanuka is out 1 November on Polydor",

      "body": "<p>The goose, a water bird with smooth white feathers, a long neck and compressed orange bill, is not an apex predator. Yet most of us have a memory, perhaps from childhood, probably involving a plastic bag of stale bread, when we were harangued by one of these quarrelsome birds who had seemingly woken up on the wrong side of the pond. We are used to playing as morally complex individuals in video games; even the heroes typically leave a genocidal trail of dead behind them. Never before, however, have I felt so appalled by my virtual acts as in <a href=\"https://goose.game/\" title=\"\"><em>Untitled Goose Game</em></a>, which casts its player as a lone goose on a singular mission to victimise the residents of an English village via a thousand mundane, misery-making ways.</p> <p>There\u2019s the elderly man playing a game of darts in the pub garden. Nosing your beak from the leaves of a nearby bush, you\u2019ll notice how every now and again he\u2019ll perch on a nearby stool to rest his legs. It would be a shame if someone were to yank the seat away just as he sat down, wouldn\u2019t it? Then there\u2019s the gardener tending his vegetable patch close to an idle sprinkler. What would happen if someone squeaked on the tap just as he was leaning in to get a better look at his carrots? In <em>Untitled Goose Game</em> you must often think like Charlie Chaplin or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2018/apr/04/my-favourite-film-decade-1920s-nosferatu-the-general\" title=\"\">Buster Keaton</a>: surveying each new scene for its slapstick potential as you seek to fulfil the handful of back-of-a-postcard objectives set by the game\u2019s authors. Then again, sometimes being a quintessentially horrible goose requires nothing more than honking loudly and flapping one\u2019s wings at a passerby (then grabbing the terrified child\u2019s glasses after they fall to the ground). Honk!</p> <p><em>Untitled Goose Game </em>began as a joke in an online chat room shared by the developers, a lavish sort of answer to the observation: \u201cMan! What\u2019s the deal with geese, eh?\u201d The game quickly found an obsessed following on social media, thanks to a number of brilliantly funny clips showing a low-polygon goose being awful. What has elevated <em>Untitled Goose Game</em> above a simple, one-note gag (and from being any of the 10,000 poorer variations of how the idea might have turned out in less-able hands) is the finesse of its ideas and the precision of its observations.

      "bodyText": "The goose, a water bird with smooth white feathers, a long neck and compressed orange bill, is not an apex predator. Yet most of us have a memory, perhaps from childhood, probably involving a plastic bag of stale bread, when we were harangued by one of these quarrelsome birds who had seemingly woken up on the wrong side of the pond. We are used to playing as morally complex individuals in video games; even the heroes typically leave a genocidal trail of dead behind them. Never before, however, have I felt so appalled by my virtual acts as in Untitled Goose Game, which casts its player as a lone goose on a singular mission to victimise the residents of an English village via a thousand mundane, misery-making ways. There\u2019s the elderly man playing a game of darts in the pub garden. Nosing your beak from the leaves of a nearby bush, you\u2019ll notice how every now and again he\u2019ll perch on a nearby stool to rest his legs. It would be a shame if someone were to yank the seat away just as he sat down, wouldn\u2019t it? Then there\u2019s the gardener tending his vegetable patch close to an idle sprinkler. What would happen if someone squeaked on the tap just as he was leaning in to get a better look at his carrots? In Untitled Goose Game you must often think like Charlie Chaplin or Buster Keaton: surveying each new scene for its slapstick potential as you seek to fulfil the handful of back-of-a-postcard objectives set by the game\u2019s authors. Then again, sometimes being a quintessentially horrible goose requires nothing more than honking loudly and flapping one\u2019s wings at a passerby (then grabbing the terrified child\u2019s glasses after they fall to the ground). Honk! Untitled Goose Game began as a joke in an online chat room shared by the developers, a lavish sort of answer to the observation: \u201cMan! What\u2019s the deal with geese, eh?\u201d The game quickly found an obsessed following on social media, thanks to a number of brilliantly funny clips showing a low-polygon goose being awful. What has elevated Untitled Goose Game above a simple, one-note gag (and from being any of the 10,000 poorer variations of how the idea might have turned out in less-able hands) is the finesse of its ideas and the precision of its observations. The goose waddles with exactly the authentic combination of conceit and threat, the comic waggle of its tail feathers juxtaposed with the menace of its rasping tongue. There\u2019s a throb of joyful recognition when, having cowed a villager, you waddle away while issuing a belligerent farewell honk. Classic goose! Here, animation becomes character. When, with the squeeze of a button, the bird puffs out its chest and beats its wings in an effort to intimidate a broom-wielding human opponent, there\u2019s a mixture of animal fury and pitiful inelegance at play. Witness the magical transition when the goose moves from splashing awkwardly into water to streaking, with sophisticated swiftness, through its surface.

      "body": "<p>In 2005, when I was 16, I worked in a busy local caf\u00e9. My job was to make tea and coffee and I churned out hot beverages at high speed, while constantly restocking my cup and saucer area. I found the work hard and boring, which was strange given that at the end of every shift I\u2019d rush home to play Diner Dash, a video game in which you become a waitress in a busy restaurant, taking orders, serving customers, clearing away their cups and plates. </p> <p>In the great pantheon of PC games, Diner Dash was not among the most realistic, but I enjoyed its simplicity and I was enthralled by the thrill that came with pleasing customers and advancing levels. How many levels were available was never made clear. The game seemed infinite. I\u2019d play it for hours.</p> <p>In 2017, I lost my job \u2013 a version of my dream job, <em>the</em> job \u2013 and slipped from an exhilarating workplace into the terrifying tundra of freelance life, a transition that led to a period of acute anxiety. Like other freelancers, I began to spend most of my working week at home, alone, making lists, staring out of the window at the pigeons. Sometimes I read Amazon reviews of household items, which was exciting. I wondered how and when I would die.</p> <p>I tried exercising. I tried having more meetings. I tried structure. But nothing seemed to dissipate a niggling, hollow feeling of worry. Then I downloaded a new-ish version of The Sims, the popular simulation game. Bingo. It was like putting Vaseline on chapped lips.</p> <p>The Sims, in which you design and build homes in a blank slate of a neighbourhood, and set about creating \u201cSims\u201d to live inside them, was released in 2000, and is the bestselling PC game of all time. Its follow-up, The Sims II, was released in 2004, and was as compulsive as its predecessor. As a teenager, The Sims was my jam. Back then I averaged two or three hours every weekday, and I\u2019d put in a proper sesh at the weekend. Sometimes I\u2019d play for six hours straight. It felt wonderful to return from the incomprehensibly dull monotony of school to a digital world I\u2019d created, a kind of haven of order and control.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6407685623ff54675aac4a83b90f41ab7ff2a678\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6407685623ff54675aac4a83b90f41ab7ff2a678/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018It felt wonderful to return from the incomprehensibly dull monotony of school to a digital world I\u2019d created, a kind of haven of order and control\u2019: a still from The Sims.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It felt wonderful to return from the incomprehensibly dull monotony of school to a digital world I\u2019d created, a kind of haven of order and control\u2019: a still from The Sims.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: EA Games</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My interminable adolescent thirst to be someone else was quenched. I could throw teachers I disliked into swimming pools. I could invent a Josh Hartnett Sim and command him to kiss an incredibly suave, sexy Sim who, coincidentally, shared my name. I could make a Sim of a pretty, popular girl in my year at school, and prevent her from falling in love. It was a kind of escapism. Beautiful. Addictive. A little devilish.</p> <p>The game\u2019s creator, EA Games, has slowly expanded the series, from The Sims to The Sims II to The Sims 4 Deluxe Party Edition. (A recent expansion pack is named Sims 4: Laundry Day Stuff.) Each Sim has a different personality: turn-ons, turn-offs. Green health bars are shown in a control panel at the bottom of the screen, through which you can identify their needs. If a Sim\u2019s energy bar turns red, they might suddenly fall asleep on the floor; if their fun bar runs out, they\u2019ll become depressed and refuse to go to work. Gradually, your Sims begin to accrue responsibilities: jobs, pets, children, relationships. You are rewarded with points when your Sims thrive; the healthier and wealthier your Sims become, the more enjoyable the game.</p> <p>The game\u2019s appeal lies in its close-to-real-life-ness. You pay bills. You load the dishwasher. You make beds. You clean stuff. (In a game, you clean stuff!) Tuck your Sims up after a hard day\u2019s work and dinner spent together as a family and experience the pride of a weary, content mother.</p> <p>You cannot \u201cwin\u201d \u2013 there is no credit roll. Your Sims might reach the top of their career ladders, retire with a healthy pension, and die, but the game goes on. I\u2019ve played it so much in the past few months that even the great grandchildren of my original Sims have succumbed to old age.</p> <p>For a self-obsessed teenager, the feeling of playing it indoors during the balmy summer holidays, my family downstairs hanging out while I clicked away like a spotty, nerdy ghoul, was sometimes one of unease. I remember a time my grandfather tried to engage me while I was playing, and I ignored him until he left the room. It was one of the last times I saw him. That unease returned while I played on Boxing Day, 2018. This time I was a 30-year-old adult.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d0270bc9b16ee8cf349a9e2896974a5e4479f5cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d0270bc9b16ee8cf349a9e2896974a5e4479f5cc/0_929_6201_3718/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Games might offer little in terms of tasks, but make up for it with their landscapes\u2019: The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Games might offer little in terms of tasks, but make up for it with their landscapes\u2019: The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nintendo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This latest habit began in November last year, as I rapidly approached a huge work deadline. A few days before I was nowhere near ready, and had reached peak procrastination, spending valuable time downloading updates for my phone and computer. I knew The Sims would be catastrophically detrimental to my deadline. And my social life. And my relationship. And I clicked \u201cpurchase\u201d anyway.</p> <p>That week I played until 3am every night. I played in every spare waking minute I had. Once, I considered getting out my laptop and playing on the top deck of a bus. Some days I\u2019d get up early to get a quick hit before I started work, knowing that if I didn\u2019t, I\u2019d crave playing all day.</p> <p>A few weeks after I downloaded the game, I found myself at a walk-in clinic being told I was developing a repetitive strain injury in my wrist, from overusing my computer\u2019s trackpad. My right eyelid started twitching uncontrollably \u2013 too much late-night screen-time. I told people it was because I drank too much caffeine.</p> <p>In some of my lowest moments of last year, pre-Sims, when the anxiety was a struggle, I became obsessed with doing laundry. It excited me, particularly a good white wash, the removal of stains. Laundry became an achievable goal. Something I could do well and quickly. A good wash offered immediate reward. The Sims offered similar rewards. I became good at the game. In a world I had designed and constructed, my Sims thrived. And having control over their lives meant it became easier to escape dwelling on what was going on in my own. When I played the game, my worries floated away, my thoughts disappeared.</p> <p><em><strong>In 2017, the video</strong></em> games journalist Andy Kelly pulled together a list of \u201cPC\u2019s most relaxing games\u201d for <em><a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/\" title=\"\">PC Gamer</a></em><a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/\" title=\"\">.</a> \u201cFlick to any news channel and it\u2019s like watching the pre-credits sequence for an apocalyptic action movie,\u201d he wrote below his recommendations. \u201cSo turn your TV off and switch on your PC, where lovely, precious video games will help you forget about the world burning outside.\u201d The ultimate escapism.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a90d163a895058b06c9950810b18fe61b1951d1d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a90d163a895058b06c9950810b18fe61b1951d1d/0_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Screen saver: a still from Sea of Solitude.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Screen saver: a still from Sea of Solitude.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: EA Games</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Huge numbers of new games are being designed with distraction, joy or tranquillity in mind. Calm games that present you with manageable, gratifying tasks and puzzles. Games that don\u2019t make you want to smash your controller into the wall with frustration.</p> <p>Earlier this year, the <em>New York Times</em> listed games that have been designed to aid anxiety and discussed their ability to help people through troubling times. One game, Sea of Solitude, was created by game designer Cornelia Geppert, who had experienced a bad break-up. The intense loneliness she was dealing with manifested itself in the game\u2019s lead character, Kay. What better way to get through something difficult than to utilise the power of your emotions in order to create something good that will then, later down the line, presumably help others who experience it too? It mirrors the therapeutic and generous act of writing and releasing the perfect break-up song.</p> <p>Kelly\u2019s article, and its focus on how much games can help us, reminded me of an episode of the tech-focused <a href=\"https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all\" title=\"\">Reply All podcast</a> called <a href=\"https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/o2ho2j\" title=\"\">Autumn</a>, in which a teenage girl who is experiencing difficulties in her life turns to The Sims to create a character of her recently deceased grandmother so she could visit her, build a beautiful garden for her, and interact with her (even if it was just in Sims-speak, or \u201cSimlish\u201d). Her actions are perfectly summed up in an <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/apr/06/five-damaging-myths-about-video-games-lets-shoot-em-up\" title=\"\">Observer</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/apr/06/five-damaging-myths-about-video-games-lets-shoot-em-up\" title=\"\"> article</a> by Pete Etchells. \u201cVideo games place you at the centre of the story \u2013 you are an active participant, instead of a passive observer. They offer us a safe place to interrogate and test the emotional consequences of our actions. Far from being a meaningless waste of time, then, games help us explore what it means to be human, to explore notions of love and loss, and to allow us to travel to far-off incredible places, to become incredible people \u2013 all from the comfort of our own home.\u201d</p> <p>Fans of The Legend of Zelda speak of the happy and relaxed sensation they feel just by being able to explore a tranquil landscape as a character. To run and jump through meadows without getting a stitch, chop down long grass with a sword, gallop a horse through a canyon, go fishing. You can amble around doing not much at all on games like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/red-dead-redemption\" title=\"\">Red Dead Redemption</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/grand-theft-auto\" title=\"\">Grand Theft Auto</a>, but the temptation to kill \u2013 or unintentionally commit manslaughter \u2013 can sometimes stand in the way of the game being \u201crelaxing\u201d per se. Some games offer little in terms of tasks, but make up for it in what can be explored in the landscape.</p> <p>Take the 2016 cross-console game <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/08/firewatch-review-first-person-simulation-adventure-game\" title=\"\">Firewatch</a>. The game information on its website is as tantalising as the blurb on the back of an appealing holiday read: \u201cThe year is 1989. You are a man named Henry who has retreated from your messy life to work as a fire lookout in the Wyoming wilderness. Perched atop a mountain, it\u2019s your job to find smoke and keep the wilderness safe.\u201d What you\u2019re saying is I have to walk around a beautiful forest on my own and \u201ckeep the wilderness safe\u201d? Sign me up.</p> <p><em><strong>Occupational psychologist</strong></em> Kirsten Godfrey believes that it is an evolutionary aspect of human nature to desire a certain level of control over ourselves in order to achieve positive outcomes in our lives. \u201cWe\u2019re often drawn to tasks that are easy to complete or give us some sense of reward,\u201d Godfrey says. \u201cThat buzz you get from completing your to-do list or achieving the next level on a game can trigger the release of dopamine in the brain, making you feel good \u2013 just the ticket when you\u2019re not feeling good.\u201d</p> <p>But like any dopamine hit, it\u2019s best enjoyed in small measures, and warily. It can be addictive. \u201cIt\u2019s about knowing when to do enough to make yourself feel better,\u201d Godfrey warns, \u201cbut not so much you become dependent.\u201d She says that desiring a feeling of control is simple human nature. We do it \u201cto be able to influence and choose what we do and equally the outcomes of that\u201d.</p> <p>She\u2019s right. Since realising why I am playing The Sims so much, it\u2019s made me want to play it (a little) less. I\u2019m much better than I was a few months ago. I don\u2019t get scared to leave the house, I don\u2019t sleep in the day. Work feels manageable and it doesn\u2019t feel as difficult to keep my head above water. I\u2019m excited about the future and about starting a new relationship with gaming; loosening my grip on The Sims 2 and experimenting with something new. I\u2019m not ashamed of how I\u2019m spending my time. You can\u2019t \u201cwin\u201d at life any more than you can \u201cwin\u201d at The Sims. All you can do is spend it doing what you love, with some laundry thrown in for good measure.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In 2005, when I was 16, I worked in a busy local caf\u00e9. My job was to make tea and coffee and I churned out hot beverages at high speed, while constantly restocking my cup and saucer area. I found the work hard and boring, which was strange given that at the end of every shift I\u2019d rush home to play Diner Dash, a video game in which you become a waitress in a busy restaurant, taking orders, serving customers, clearing away their cups and plates. In the great pantheon of PC games, Diner Dash was not among the most realistic, but I enjoyed its simplicity and I was enthralled by the thrill that came with pleasing customers and advancing levels. How many levels were available was never made clear. The game seemed infinite. I\u2019d play it for hours. In 2017, I lost my job \u2013 a version of my dream job, the job \u2013 and slipped from an exhilarating workplace into the terrifying tundra of freelance life, a transition that led to a period of acute anxiety. Like other freelancers, I began to spend most of my working week at home, alone, making lists, staring out of the window at the pigeons. Sometimes I read Amazon reviews of household items, which was exciting. I wondered how and when I would die. I tried exercising. I tried having more meetings. I tried structure. But nothing seemed to dissipate a niggling, hollow feeling of worry. Then I downloaded a new-ish version of The Sims, the popular simulation game. Bingo. It was like putting Vaseline on chapped lips. The Sims, in which you design and build homes in a blank slate of a neighbourhood, and set about creating \u201cSims\u201d to live inside them, was released in 2000, and is the bestselling PC game of all time. Its follow-up, The Sims II, was released in 2004, and was as compulsive as its predecessor. As a teenager, The Sims was my jam. Back then I averaged two or three hours every weekday, and I\u2019d put in a proper sesh at the weekend. Sometimes I\u2019d play for six hours straight. It felt wonderful to return from the incomprehensibly dull monotony of school to a digital world I\u2019d created, a kind of haven of order and control. My interminable adolescent thirst to be someone else was quenched. I could throw teachers I disliked into swimming pools. I could invent a Josh Hartnett Sim and command him to kiss an incredibly suave, sexy Sim who, coincidentally, shared my name. I could make a Sim of a pretty, popular girl in my year at school, and prevent her from falling in love. It was a kind of escapism. Beautiful. Addictive. A little devilish. The game\u2019s creator, EA Games, has slowly expanded the series, from The Sims to The Sims II to The Sims 4 Deluxe Party Edition. (A recent expansion pack is named Sims 4: Laundry Day Stuff.) Each Sim has a different personality: turn-ons, turn-offs. Green health bars are shown in a control panel at the bottom of the screen, through which you can identify their needs. If a Sim\u2019s energy bar turns red, they might suddenly fall asleep on the floor; if their fun bar runs out, they\u2019ll become depressed and refuse to go to work. Gradually, your Sims begin to accrue responsibilities: jobs, pets, children, relationships. You are rewarded with points when your Sims thrive; the healthier and wealthier your Sims become, the more enjoyable the game. The game\u2019s appeal lies in its close-to-real-life-ness. You pay bills. You load the dishwasher. You make beds. You clean stuff. (In a game, you clean stuff!) Tuck your Sims up after a hard day\u2019s work and dinner spent together as a family and experience the pride of a weary, content mother. You cannot \u201cwin\u201d \u2013 there is no credit roll. Your Sims might reach the top of their career ladders, retire with a healthy pension, and die, but the game goes on. I\u2019ve played it so much in the past few months that even the great grandchildren of my original Sims have succumbed to old age. For a self-obsessed teenager, the feeling of playing it indoors during the balmy summer holidays, my family downstairs hanging out while I clicked away like a spotty, nerdy ghoul, was sometimes one of unease. I remember a time my grandfather tried to engage me while I was playing, and I ignored him until he left the room. It was one of the last times I saw him. That unease returned while I played on Boxing Day, 2018. This time I was a 30-year-old adult. This latest habit began in November last year, as I rapidly approached a huge work deadline. A few days before I was nowhere near ready, and had reached peak procrastination, spending valuable time downloading updates for my phone and computer. I knew The Sims would be catastrophically detrimental to my deadline. And my social life. And my relationship. And I clicked \u201cpurchase\u201d anyway. That week I played until 3am every night. I played in every spare waking minute I had. Once, I considered getting out my laptop and playing on the top deck of a bus. Some days I\u2019d get up early to get a quick hit before I started work, knowing that if I didn\u2019t, I\u2019d crave playing all day. A few weeks after I downloaded the game, I found myself at a walk-in clinic being told I was developing a repetitive strain injury in my wrist, from overusing my computer\u2019s trackpad. My right eyelid started twitching uncontrollably \u2013 too much late-night screen-time. I told people it was because I drank too much caffeine. In some of my lowest moments of last year, pre-Sims, when the anxiety was a struggle, I became obsessed with doing laundry. It excited me, particularly a good white wash, the removal of stains. Laundry became an achievable goal. Something I could do well and quickly. A good wash offered immediate reward. The Sims offered similar rewards. I became good at the game. In a world I had designed and constructed, my Sims thrived. And having control over their lives meant it became easier to escape dwelling on what was going on in my own. When I played the game, my worries floated away, my thoughts disappeared. In 2017, the video games journalist Andy Kelly pulled together a list of \u201cPC\u2019s most relaxing games\u201d for PC Gamer. \u201cFlick to any news channel and it\u2019s like watching the pre-credits sequence for an apocalyptic action movie,\u201d he wrote below his recommendations. \u201cSo turn your TV off and switch on your PC, where lovely, precious video games will help you forget about the world burning outside.\u201d The ultimate escapism. Huge numbers of new games are being designed with distraction, joy or tranquillity in mind. Calm games that present you with manageable, gratifying tasks and puzzles. Games that don\u2019t make you want to smash your controller into the wall with frustration. Earlier this year, the New York Times listed games that have been designed to aid anxiety and discussed their ability to help people through troubling times. One game, Sea of Solitude, was created by game designer Cornelia Geppert, who had experienced a bad break-up. The intense loneliness she was dealing with manifested itself in the game\u2019s lead character, Kay. What better way to get through something difficult than to utilise the power of your emotions in order to create something good that will then, later down the line, presumably help others who experience it too? It mirrors the therapeutic and generous act of writing and releasing the perfect break-up song. Kelly\u2019s article, and its focus on how much games can help us, reminded me of an episode of the tech-focused Reply All podcast called Autumn, in which a teenage girl who is experiencing difficulties in her life turns to The Sims to create a character of her recently deceased grandmother so she could visit her, build a beautiful garden for her, and interact with her (even if it was just in Sims-speak, or \u201cSimlish\u201d). Her actions are perfectly summed up in an Observer article by Pete Etchells. \u201cVideo games place you at the centre of the story \u2013 you are an active participant, instead of a passive observer. They offer us a safe place to interrogate and test the emotional consequences of our actions. Far from being a meaningless waste of time, then, games help us explore what it means to be human, to explore notions of love and loss, and to allow us to travel to far-off incredible places, to become incredible people \u2013 all from the comfort of our own home.\u201d Fans of The Legend of Zelda speak of the happy and relaxed sensation they feel just by being able to explore a tranquil landscape as a character. To run and jump through meadows without getting a stitch, chop down long grass with a sword, gallop a horse through a canyon, go fishing. You can amble around doing not much at all on games like Red Dead Redemption or Grand Theft Auto, but the temptation to kill \u2013 or unintentionally commit manslaughter \u2013 can sometimes stand in the way of the game being \u201crelaxing\u201d per se. Some games offer little in terms of tasks, but make up for it in what can be explored in the landscape. Take the 2016 cross-console game Firewatch. The game information on its website is as tantalising as the blurb on the back of an appealing holiday read: \u201cThe year is 1989. You are a man named Henry who has retreated from your messy life to work as a fire lookout in the Wyoming wilderness. Perched atop a mountain, it\u2019s your job to find smoke and keep the wilderness safe.\u201d What you\u2019re saying is I have to walk around a beautiful forest on my own and \u201ckeep the wilderness safe\u201d? Sign me up. Occupational psychologist Kirsten Godfrey believes that it is an evolutionary aspect of human nature to desire a certain level of control over ourselves in order to achieve positive outcomes in our lives. \u201cWe\u2019re often drawn to tasks that are easy to complete or give us some sense of reward,\u201d Godfrey says. \u201cThat buzz you get from completing your to-do list or achieving the next level on a game can trigger the release of dopamine in the brain, making you feel good \u2013 just the ticket when you\u2019re not feeling good.\u201d But like any dopamine hit, it\u2019s best enjoyed in small measures, and warily. It can be addictive. \u201cIt\u2019s about knowing when to do enough to make yourself feel better,\u201d Godfrey warns, \u201cbut not so much you become dependent.\u201d She says that desiring a feeling of control is simple human nature. We do it \u201cto be able to influence and choose what we do and equally the outcomes of that\u201d. She\u2019s right. Since realising why I am playing The Sims so much, it\u2019s made me want to play it (a little) less. I\u2019m much better than I was a few months ago. I don\u2019t get scared to leave the house, I don\u2019t sleep in the day. Work feels manageable and it doesn\u2019t feel as difficult to keep my head above water. I\u2019m excited about the future and about starting a new relationship with gaming; loosening my grip on The Sims 2 and experimenting with something new. I\u2019m not ashamed of how I\u2019m spending my time. You can\u2019t \u201cwin\u201d at life any more than you can \u201cwin\u201d at The Sims. All you can do is spend it doing what you love, with some laundry thrown in for good measure.",

So Jean-Claude Juncker, the outgoing president of the commission, chose the neutral word \u201cobjectively\u201d to describe how he would examine the Johnson \u201coffer\u201d. But the key players in Europe did not manage to maintain a mask of diplomatic emollience for long. Their incredulity about the proposals is too great to be contained.

Repeats of that pledge, delivered under the slogan \u201cGet Brexit done\u201d, won the loudest applause during his speech to last week\u2019s Tory conference.

How does the greased piglet wriggle out of this one?</p> <p>What Number 10 will do is the subject of feverish conjecture, which is being fed by the contradictory noises coming out of Downing Street. Government submissions to a court in Edinburgh, revealed on Friday, appear to concede that the prime minister will obey the law and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/04/boris-johnson-will-write-to-eu-requesting-article-50-extension-court-told-brexit\" title=\"\">seek an extension</a> if he cannot secure a new withdrawal agreement. Yet not long after the documents were made public, he tweeted: \u201cNew deal or no deal \u2013 but no delay.\u201d People in a very good position to know tell me that Number 10 is continuing its frantic search for ways to avoid a delay to the departure date. Some pin their hopes on the desperate idea that one of the EU states \u2013 Hungary is most often mentioned \u2013 will veto an extension for him. It is possible that some EU states \u2013 keep an eye on the French \u2013 might play into his hands by demanding concessions from Britain and assurances about its government\u2019s future behaviour as the price for an extension, concessions that he would refuse to give.</p> <p>Some at Number 10 repeatedly hint that he could go through the motions of applying for an extension, but in a way deliberately designed not to secure one. He could try this on, fully conscious that this will land him in the courts again. Being found guilty of behaving illegally for a second time would not be a great look for the leader of a party that once called itself the champion of law and order. Flagrant defiance of an act of parliament might risk the resignation of the justice secretary and some other members of the cabinet. But being brought to book by the supreme court for a second time might allow Mr Johnson to once more present himself as \u201cthe victim\u201d. His strategists believe that this is his best hope of escaping the fury of Leave voters for failing to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d and turning their wrath on his opponents.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2a8fcbacdda3fc9de114d4a05cd8acf04d00025e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a8fcbacdda3fc9de114d4a05cd8acf04d00025e/267_41_329_412/329.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn\" width=\"329\" height=\"412\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">There is no Commons majority for putting Mr Corbyn in Number 10, even on a temporary basis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sky News</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is the challenge facing the opposition parties. The united front they managed to assemble over the unlawful prorogation and the Benn Act is now looking very flaky. There have been extensive talks about replacing the Johnson government with an alternative administration and they have foundered on the fundamental disagreement about who would lead such a government. Labour insists it has to be Jeremy Corbyn, as the leader of the largest opposition party. But Labour\u2019s chief whip, Nick Brown, knows and has said as much to other opposition leaders that there is no Commons majority for putting Mr Corbyn in Number 10, even on a temporary basis. Virtually none of the Tory MPs who were purged from their party and now sit as independents will agree to that. They might be prepared to give the keys to Number 10 to a different kind of Labour leader, but they won\u2019t have him. Nor will the Independent Group of MPs led by Anna Soubry. Nor will the Lib Dems, not least because they have several new recruits who quit Labour on the grounds that Mr Corbyn is unfit to be prime minister. One person intimately involved with the talks says the prospects of the so-called Rebel Alliance forming an alternative government are now \u201cdead\u201d.</p> <p>That makes it more likely that we will soon be facing a general election. The opposition parties have twice prevented one happening before the end of October on the grounds that Mr Johnson would try to \u201ccheat\u201d and crash Britain out of the EU regardless. That objection to an election falls away once an extension is in place. The Scottish Nationalists want one before Christmas because their prospects of winning seats currently look promising. Their former leader, Alex Salmond, will <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-48966815\" title=\"\">stand trial</a> on multiple charges of attempted rape and sexual assault, which he strongly denies, in January. Irrespective of the outcome, coverage of the trial is unlikely to be helpful to the Nationalists.</p> <p>Many Lib Dems think they are in a sweet spot to profit from a rapid election. The Tory rebels are not keen. Most, if not all, of them would be wiped out if they stood as independents. The Soubry group fears the same fate. The Labour party is hopelessly split \u2013 not news, this, I know \u2013 on election timing. The residual Corbyn devotees cling to the faith that the party\u2019s dismal poll ratings, and the leader\u2019s even worse ones, will be magically transformed for the better just as soon as he is put on a campaign bus. A significant proportion of Labour MPs believe it would be terrible for the country to fight an election with Brexit still unresolved and politically suicidal for their party to face the voters in the winter.</p> <p>If there is an election and the Tories win it on a no-deal manifesto because Labour is so divided, equivocal and unpopular, there will be a whole other blame game to be played.</p> <p>\u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer</p>",

Some at Number 10 repeatedly hint that he could go through the motions of applying for an extension, but in a way deliberately designed not to secure one. He could try this on, fully conscious that this will land him in the courts again. Being found guilty of behaving illegally for a second time would not be a great look for the leader of a party that once called itself the champion of law and order. Flagrant defiance of an act of parliament might risk the resignation of the justice secretary and some other members of the cabinet. But being brought to book by the supreme court for a second time might allow Mr Johnson to once more present himself as \u201cthe victim\u201d. His strategists believe that this is his best hope of escaping the fury of Leave voters for failing to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d and turning their wrath on his opponents. This is the challenge facing the opposition parties. The united front they managed to assemble over the unlawful prorogation and the Benn Act is now looking very flaky. There have been extensive talks about replacing the Johnson government with an alternative administration and they have foundered on the fundamental disagreement about who would lead such a government. Labour insists it has to be Jeremy Corbyn, as the leader of the largest opposition party. But Labour\u2019s chief whip, Nick Brown, knows and has said as much to other opposition leaders that there is no Commons majority for putting Mr Corbyn in Number 10, even on a temporary basis. Virtually none of the Tory MPs who were purged from their party and now sit as independents will agree to that. They might be prepared to give the keys to Number 10 to a different kind of Labour leader, but they won\u2019t have him. Nor will the Independent Group of MPs led by Anna Soubry. Nor will the Lib Dems, not least because they have several new recruits who quit Labour on the grounds that Mr Corbyn is unfit to be prime minister. One person intimately involved with the talks says the prospects of the so-called Rebel Alliance forming an alternative government are now \u201cdead\u201d. That makes it more likely that we will soon be facing a general election. The opposition parties have twice prevented one happening before the end of October on the grounds that Mr Johnson would try to \u201ccheat\u201d and crash Britain out of the EU regardless. That objection to an election falls away once an extension is in place. The Scottish Nationalists want one before Christmas because their prospects of winning seats currently look promising. Their former leader, Alex Salmond, will stand trial on multiple charges of attempted rape and sexual assault, which he strongly denies, in January. Irrespective of the outcome, coverage of the trial is unlikely to be helpful to the Nationalists. Many Lib Dems think they are in a sweet spot to profit from a rapid election. The Tory rebels are not keen. Most, if not all, of them would be wiped out if they stood as independents. The Soubry group fears the same fate. The Labour party is hopelessly split \u2013 not news, this, I know \u2013 on election timing. The residual Corbyn devotees cling to the faith that the party\u2019s dismal poll ratings, and the leader\u2019s even worse ones, will be magically transformed for the better just as soon as he is put on a campaign bus. A significant proportion of Labour MPs believe it would be terrible for the country to fight an election with Brexit still unresolved and politically suicidal for their party to face the voters in the winter. If there is an election and the Tories win it on a no-deal manifesto because Labour is so divided, equivocal and unpopular, there will be a whole other blame game to be played. \u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer",

Hearing added: \u201cI would like to collect as much evidence as possible, and anybody here who took photographs or were present during previous demonstrations, then please pass them forward, that would be greatly appreciated.\u201d The Met\u2019s intervention followed a tumultuous week in Creasy\u2019s constituency during which the divisive billboard was daubed with white paint before being pulled down by council officials. Creasy lodged complaints with the police, the Speaker of the Commons and the home secretary. Creasy told Saturday\u2019s meeting at Walthamstow Trades Hall that the actions of the anti-abortion protestors were not just an attack on her, but \u201ccollective harassment\u201d against the women of Walthamstow. She said: \u201cIt shows the gaps in the law that if they were showing pictures of the KKK, or making homophobic remarks on their posters, it would not be a matter of debate that it had to be taken down. We have to show that this is a form of harassment.\u201d She urged those present to report harassment to the council and police. Another speaker was Dr Pam Lowe from Aston University, an expert in reproductive health, who has studied the Centre for Bio-Ethical Reform in the US and described it as promoting \u201cshock tactics.\u201d She said the group had previously targeted the Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau in a similar way to Creasy over the Canadian prime minister\u2019s pro-choice position. Lowe added that the group\u2019s strategy was aimed at ensuring phrases such as \u201cbaby murderer\u201d became normalised, warning that such tactics had the potential to radicalise individuals and had incited violence in the US. One member of the audience said she had registered a complaint with the Met last week that the anti-abortion protests constituted \u201cgendered hate crime\u201d, although Hearing pointed out that \u201cto be insulted by something is not a crime\u201d. Another said the actions of the group were \u201cdebasing our political fabric\u201d and described the tactics as \u201cextremist\u201d and \u201cclearly gendered harassment\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>What would you do to save the world? Not the strapline for a Netflix series, but rather the question that sits behind <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/jonathan-safran-foer\" title=\"\">Jonathan Safran Foer</a>\u2019s second work of nonfiction, <em>We Are the Weather</em>. The answer to the question appears to be \u201cnot very much\u201d, given that despite the looming threat of global heating, despite the fact the next generation (and those that follow) will live more precarious lives, with food, water and clean air in ever-shorter supply, despite the fact that the future of our planet appears to be one of flooded cities, scorched forests and sulphurous skies, we continue to behave as if the climate crisis is someone else\u2019s problem. In 2018, despite knowing more about climate change than we have ever known, we produced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/05/brutal-news-global-carbon-emissions-jump-to-all-time-high-in-2018\" title=\"\">more greenhouse gases</a> than we have ever produced, at three times the rate of global population growth.</p> <p>Climate change, therefore, exists as a rhetorical challenge as much as a scientific one. The most pressing question is how to persuade people to act, and to act now, both on an individual basis and, particularly, collectively. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/extinction-rebellion\" title=\"\">Extinction Rebellion</a> provides a blueprint for action, but what about the majority who aren\u2019t about to chain themselves to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/19/farhana-yamin-extinction-rebellion-unglue-shell\" title=\"\">headquarters of Shell</a>? One landmark in the rhetorical battle was Al Gore\u2019s 2006 film <em>An Inconvenient Truth</em>, although it may surprise you to learn that Gore\u2019s film, for all its rigour, didn\u2019t mention the single largest contributor to global heating: livestock.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I can\u2019t imagine anyone reading Safran Foer\u2019s lucid, compassionate prose and then reaching blithely for a cheeseburger</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Now Safran Foer, best known for his astonishing magical-realist debut novel <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/everything-is-illuminated\" title=\"\">Everything Is Illuminated</a></em>, but also the author of a bestselling 2009 book about factory farming, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/28/eating-animals-jonathan-safran-foer\" title=\"\">Eating Animals</a></em>, has set about remedying that omission. In <em>We Are the Weather</em>, he demonstrates that, rather than being an insurmountable nexus of insoluble problems, there\u2019s one small change that all of us can make that would have a sustained and far-reaching impact on the climate crisis: eating fewer animal products. \u201cWe cannot keep the kind of meals we have known and also keep the planet we have known. We must either let some eating habits go or let the planet go. It is as straightforward and as fraught as that.\u201d</p> <p>First, a warning: this is a life-changing book and will alter your relationship to food for ever. I can\u2019t imagine anyone reading Safran Foer\u2019s lucid, heartfelt, deeply compassionate prose and then reaching blithely for a cheeseburger. There\u2019s some dispute as to precisely what proportion of global heating is directly related to the rearing of animals for food, but even the lowest estimates put it on a par with the entire global transportation industry. A well-evidenced <a href=\"http://www.worldwatch.org/files/pdf/Livestock%20and%20Climate%20Change.pdf\" title=\"\">2009 report by the Worldwatch Institute</a> claimed that livestock-related emissions accounted for 51% of all greenhouse gases, \u201cmore than all cars, planes, buildings, industry and power plants combined\u201d. Whichever the case, Safran Foer\u2019s thesis is clear and compelling: by making \u201ca collective act to eat differently\u201d (he suggests \u201cno animal products before dinner\u201d) we can turn the tide of the climate crisis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/06/eating-animals-review-natalie-portman-christopher-quinn-agribusiness-documentary\">Eating Animals review \u2013 painful portrait of factory farming</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The book is made up of five sections, each divided into a series of sharp, hard-hitting chapters. Part two, How to Prevent the Greatest Dying, is a bombardment of facts that seeks to overwhelm the reader with evidence. \u201cHumans use 59% of all the land capable of growing crops to grow food for livestock\u201d; \u201c60% of all mammals on Earth are animals raised for food\u201d; \u201cThere are approximately 30 farmed animals for every human on the planet\u201d; \u201cIn 2018, more than 99% of the animals eaten in America were raised on factory farms\u201d; \u201cAnimal agriculture is responsible for 91% of Amazon deforestation\u201d; \u201cIf cows were a country, they would rank third in greenhouse gas emissions, after China and the United States.\u201d</p> <p>These facts, though, are part of the problem, rather than the solution. The point is, we know this stuff, we just don\u2019t believe it.

      "bodyText": "What would you do to save the world? Not the strapline for a Netflix series, but rather the question that sits behind Jonathan Safran Foer\u2019s second work of nonfiction, We Are the Weather. The answer to the question appears to be \u201cnot very much\u201d, given that despite the looming threat of global heating, despite the fact the next generation (and those that follow) will live more precarious lives, with food, water and clean air in ever-shorter supply, despite the fact that the future of our planet appears to be one of flooded cities, scorched forests and sulphurous skies, we continue to behave as if the climate crisis is someone else\u2019s problem. In 2018, despite knowing more about climate change than we have ever known, we produced more greenhouse gases than we have ever produced, at three times the rate of global population growth. Climate change, therefore, exists as a rhetorical challenge as much as a scientific one. The most pressing question is how to persuade people to act, and to act now, both on an individual basis and, particularly, collectively. Extinction Rebellion provides a blueprint for action, but what about the majority who aren\u2019t about to chain themselves to the headquarters of Shell? One landmark in the rhetorical battle was Al Gore\u2019s 2006 film An Inconvenient Truth, although it may surprise you to learn that Gore\u2019s film, for all its rigour, didn\u2019t mention the single largest contributor to global heating: livestock. Now Safran Foer, best known for his astonishing magical-realist debut novel Everything Is Illuminated, but also the author of a bestselling 2009 book about factory farming, Eating Animals, has set about remedying that omission. In We Are the Weather, he demonstrates that, rather than being an insurmountable nexus of insoluble problems, there\u2019s one small change that all of us can make that would have a sustained and far-reaching impact on the climate crisis: eating fewer animal products. \u201cWe cannot keep the kind of meals we have known and also keep the planet we have known. We must either let some eating habits go or let the planet go. It is as straightforward and as fraught as that.\u201d First, a warning: this is a life-changing book and will alter your relationship to food for ever. I can\u2019t imagine anyone reading Safran Foer\u2019s lucid, heartfelt, deeply compassionate prose and then reaching blithely for a cheeseburger. There\u2019s some dispute as to precisely what proportion of global heating is directly related to the rearing of animals for food, but even the lowest estimates put it on a par with the entire global transportation industry. A well-evidenced 2009 report by the Worldwatch Institute claimed that livestock-related emissions accounted for 51% of all greenhouse gases, \u201cmore than all cars, planes, buildings, industry and power plants combined\u201d. Whichever the case, Safran Foer\u2019s thesis is clear and compelling: by making \u201ca collective act to eat differently\u201d (he suggests \u201cno animal products before dinner\u201d) we can turn the tide of the climate crisis. The book is made up of five sections, each divided into a series of sharp, hard-hitting chapters. Part two, How to Prevent the Greatest Dying, is a bombardment of facts that seeks to overwhelm the reader with evidence. \u201cHumans use 59% of all the land capable of growing crops to grow food for livestock\u201d; \u201c60% of all mammals on Earth are animals raised for food\u201d; \u201cThere are approximately 30 farmed animals for every human on the planet\u201d; \u201cIn 2018, more than 99% of the animals eaten in America were raised on factory farms\u201d; \u201cAnimal agriculture is responsible for 91% of Amazon deforestation\u201d; \u201cIf cows were a country, they would rank third in greenhouse gas emissions, after China and the United States.\u201d These facts, though, are part of the problem, rather than the solution. The point is, we know this stuff, we just don\u2019t believe it. And so the rest of the book is dedicated to persuading us that it is our duty to act, just as, Safran Foer suggests, it was the duty of Jewish leaders in the US to act when Jan Karski, a member of the Polish underground, came to them in June 1943 with news of the murder and persecution of Jews in Europe. The Jewish leaders, and particularly the supreme court justice Felix Frankfurter, didn\u2019t act. \u201cI am unable to believe what you told me,\u201d Frankfurter told Karski.

At the White House this week the sun was shining, a bust of Ronald Reagan reposed outside the West Wing office of the press secretary, a US marine saluted the president as he boarded Marine One and scores of African American millennials cheered him in the east room.</p> <p>But inside Donald Trump\u2019s head, there was no calm. The storm was a firestorm.</p> <p>The president\u2019s behaviour broke boundaries so stupendously that the fact he congratulated communist China on its 70th birthday, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/01/us/politics/trump-border-wars.html\">reportedly demanded alligators or snakes</a> and flesh-piercing spikes for his border wall and wrote the unpresidential word \u201cBULLSHIT\u201d on social media were soon relegated to historical footnotes.</p> <p>Instead, as the walls of an impeachment inquiry closed in, it will be remembered as Trump\u2019s week of rage.

The other is something alien: a commander-in-chief who does not deny wrongdoing because he does not see the wrong, but rather recommits in broad daylight, confounding his defenders as if hellbent on self-impeachment.</p> <p>Jacobs added: \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is the house of cards he built \u2013 how he casually manipulated domestic and foreign leaders to work for him \u2013 is imploding. It\u2019s not just the occasional leak, but every day there seems to be a new explosion of information that\u2019s even more devastating. Trump looks like he\u2019s in a downward spiral and his efforts to pull out of it are only quickening the rate at which he is losing control of the political process, so even his supporters are asking where this is going.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/04/trump-young-black-leadership-summit-candace-owens\">Moral leader, standup comic: Trump summons alternative reality at black youth summit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The spiral began last month when Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House of Representatives, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/27/donald-trump-impeachment-inquiry-democrats-investigation\">announced an impeachment inquiry</a> against Trump. It was triggered by an intelligence community whistleblower\u2019s complaint about a July phone call in which Trump pressed Ukraine\u2019s new president to dig up dirt on the family of the former vice-president Joe Biden, his potential opponent in next year\u2019s election.</p> <p>Last Sunday, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1178477539653771264?s=20\">Trump used Twitter</a> to paraphrase a conservative pastor predicting that his removal from office could lead to a civil war. The Republican congressman Adam Kinzinger, who served in Iraq, said the tweet was \u201cbeyond repugnant\u201d. Yet somehow the president managed to become even more apocalyptic as the week wore on.</p> <p>By Monday he was suggesting that Adam Schiff, the chair of the House intelligence committee and tip of the impeachment spear, could face <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/30/trump-treason-adam-schiff-ukraine-impeachment-democrats\">\u201carrest for treason\u201d.</a> By Tuesday, he was following the lead of rightwing allies Rush Limbaugh, Hugh Hewitt and Newt Gingrich by casually tossing around the word \u201ccoup\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3a96c879ea0b460d9b3a06b87dd1121260295282\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a96c879ea0b460d9b3a06b87dd1121260295282/0_136_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018China should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine,\u2019 Trump told reporters.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018China should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine,\u2019 Trump told reporters.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the revelations kept coming. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/attorney-general-barr-personally-asked-foreign-officials-to-aid-inquiry-into-cia-fbi-activities-in-2016/2019/09/30/d50cd5c4-e3a5-11e9-b403-f738899982d2_story.html\">It was reported</a> that Trump and his attorney general, William Barr, had dragged Australia, Britain and Italy into their efforts to discredit the special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation. Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, clashed with the House committees but had to acknowledge that he was on the call between Trump and Zelenskiy.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/02/trump-impeachment-meltdown-niinisto\">On Wednesday, things got really crazy.</a> Trump sat in the Oval Office with the Finnish president, Sauli Niinist\u00f6, and lambasted \u201cshifty\u201d Schiff, saying: \u201cYou know, there\u2019s an expression: he couldn\u2019t carry his \u2018blank\u2019 strap.\u201d Mysteriously, he congratulated <em>Finland</em> for getting rid of Pelosi and Schiff. He also appeared to confess ignorance of the word \u201cmoat\u201d as he railed against the Washington Post for a story published by the New York Times.</p> <p>At a joint press conference, Trump\u2019s fury about impeachment became volcanic. A dogged reporter challenged him repeatedly over what exactly he had hoped Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelenskiy would do to Biden and his son Hunter. The irascible president <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkpes3dgzg\">went full Travis Bickle,</a> backing away from the podium and demanding: \u201cAre you talking to me?\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/10/george-conway-trump-unfit-office/599128/\">The meltdown fuelled talk</a> about Trump\u2019s psychological fitness for office. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/matthewamiller?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Matthew Miller,</a> the former director of the justice department\u2019s public affairs office, said: \u201cThe kind of display we saw, where he was disconnected from reality and angry and wallowing in self-pity, we\u2019ve seen before from him but it does seem to be ramping up pretty dramatically. We\u2019re just at the beginning of the impeachment process and it is probably going to get worse for him. Any citizen of this country has to be worried about the prospect of the president cracking up under pressure in the middle of this.\u201d</p> <p>As Republicans kept mum or scrambled for excuses, a more conventional politician would have retreated to his bunker and said nothing. That is not Trump\u2019s style. He ran towards the fire. The next morning, he walked out of the south portico at the White House to face a human wall of reporters, photographers and cameramen straining to hear him above the roar of the Marine One helicopter.</p> <p>He not only reiterated his view that Ukraine should look for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/03/trump-biden-china-investigation-demand\">dirt on the Bidens but added:</a> \u201cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine.\u201d Soliciting foreign help in an election is illegal but Trump had said the quiet part out loud, just as he did during the 2016 election campaign when he asked Russia to make Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails public. There is no evidence that the Bidens were involved in criminal corruption in either Ukraine or China.</p> <p>Miller added: \u201cFirst of all, it is fundamentally unacceptable behaviour from the president and second, in the political context, it is the worst possible thing<em> </em>that he could say in his defence.

      "bodyText": "The eye of a storm is deceptively calm. At the White House this week the sun was shining, a bust of Ronald Reagan reposed outside the West Wing office of the press secretary, a US marine saluted the president as he boarded Marine One and scores of African American millennials cheered him in the east room. But inside Donald Trump\u2019s head, there was no calm. The storm was a firestorm. The president\u2019s behaviour broke boundaries so stupendously that the fact he congratulated communist China on its 70th birthday, reportedly demanded alligators or snakes and flesh-piercing spikes for his border wall and wrote the unpresidential word \u201cBULLSHIT\u201d on social media were soon relegated to historical footnotes. Instead, as the walls of an impeachment inquiry closed in, it will be remembered as Trump\u2019s week of rage. His incoherent, wacky statements raised new fears over his state of mind. His brazen invitation to foreign powers to interfere in American elections raised new fears over his moral nihilism. \u201cIt is without parallel,\u201d said Larry Jacobs, the director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota. \u201cI have never seen a president behave in such a peculiar, irrational and self-destructive way as Trump in the last week.\u201d This is a drama unfolding on two levels. One is familiar to students of Watergate and other Washington scandals: a river of leaks, subpoenas, transcripts, whistleblowers and closed door committee hearings. The other is something alien: a commander-in-chief who does not deny wrongdoing because he does not see the wrong, but rather recommits in broad daylight, confounding his defenders as if hellbent on self-impeachment. Jacobs added: \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is the house of cards he built \u2013 how he casually manipulated domestic and foreign leaders to work for him \u2013 is imploding. It\u2019s not just the occasional leak, but every day there seems to be a new explosion of information that\u2019s even more devastating. Trump looks like he\u2019s in a downward spiral and his efforts to pull out of it are only quickening the rate at which he is losing control of the political process, so even his supporters are asking where this is going.\u201d The spiral began last month when Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House of Representatives, announced an impeachment inquiry against Trump. It was triggered by an intelligence community whistleblower\u2019s complaint about a July phone call in which Trump pressed Ukraine\u2019s new president to dig up dirt on the family of the former vice-president Joe Biden, his potential opponent in next year\u2019s election. Last Sunday, Trump used Twitter to paraphrase a conservative pastor predicting that his removal from office could lead to a civil war. The Republican congressman Adam Kinzinger, who served in Iraq, said the tweet was \u201cbeyond repugnant\u201d. Yet somehow the president managed to become even more apocalyptic as the week wore on. By Monday he was suggesting that Adam Schiff, the chair of the House intelligence committee and tip of the impeachment spear, could face \u201carrest for treason\u201d. By Tuesday, he was following the lead of rightwing allies Rush Limbaugh, Hugh Hewitt and Newt Gingrich by casually tossing around the word \u201ccoup\u201d. But the revelations kept coming. It was reported that Trump and his attorney general, William Barr, had dragged Australia, Britain and Italy into their efforts to discredit the special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation. Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, clashed with the House committees but had to acknowledge that he was on the call between Trump and Zelenskiy. On Wednesday, things got really crazy. Trump sat in the Oval Office with the Finnish president, Sauli Niinist\u00f6, and lambasted \u201cshifty\u201d Schiff, saying: \u201cYou know, there\u2019s an expression: he couldn\u2019t carry his \u2018blank\u2019 strap.\u201d Mysteriously, he congratulated Finland for getting rid of Pelosi and Schiff. He also appeared to confess ignorance of the word \u201cmoat\u201d as he railed against the Washington Post for a story published by the New York Times. At a joint press conference, Trump\u2019s fury about impeachment became volcanic. A dogged reporter challenged him repeatedly over what exactly he had hoped Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelenskiy would do to Biden and his son Hunter. The irascible president went full Travis Bickle, backing away from the podium and demanding: \u201cAre you talking to me?\u201d The meltdown fuelled talk about Trump\u2019s psychological fitness for office. Matthew Miller, the former director of the justice department\u2019s public affairs office, said: \u201cThe kind of display we saw, where he was disconnected from reality and angry and wallowing in self-pity, we\u2019ve seen before from him but it does seem to be ramping up pretty dramatically. We\u2019re just at the beginning of the impeachment process and it is probably going to get worse for him. Any citizen of this country has to be worried about the prospect of the president cracking up under pressure in the middle of this.\u201d As Republicans kept mum or scrambled for excuses, a more conventional politician would have retreated to his bunker and said nothing. That is not Trump\u2019s style. He ran towards the fire. The next morning, he walked out of the south portico at the White House to face a human wall of reporters, photographers and cameramen straining to hear him above the roar of the Marine One helicopter. He not only reiterated his view that Ukraine should look for dirt on the Bidens but added: \u201cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine.\u201d Soliciting foreign help in an election is illegal but Trump had said the quiet part out loud, just as he did during the 2016 election campaign when he asked Russia to make Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails public. There is no evidence that the Bidens were involved in criminal corruption in either Ukraine or China. Miller added: \u201cFirst of all, it is fundamentally unacceptable behaviour from the president and second, in the political context, it is the worst possible thing that he could say in his defence. There\u2019s been a lot of polling on this question about whether people think it\u2019s appropriate to ask a foreign government to intervene and the polling is overwhelmingly opposed to the idea. He\u2019s doubling down that this behaviour is OK and that\u2019s a tough position to ask Republican politicians to take.\u201d Indeed, there was a rare rebuke from two Republican senators. Ben Sasse of Nebraska observed that \u201cAmericans don\u2019t look to Chinese commies for the truth\u201d, while Mitt Romney of Utah said: \u201cBy all appearances, the president\u2019s brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling.\u201d At the opposite end of Pennsylvania Avenue, the more orthodox machinery of an impeachment inquiry was whirring on Capitol Hill.

      "body": "<p>It is a great tribute to the supreme court that it called Boris Johnson\u2019s bluff when he tried to prorogue parliament (with the emphasis on \u201crogue\u201d). Lord Pannick QC, who triumphed in the case brought by the patriotic hero Gina Miller, recalls that he was on safari, watching wild animals in Botswana, when he heard what \u201c<a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/david-pannick-qc-my-11-0-prorogation-victory-shows-that-supreme-court-has-truly-come-of-age-m5qfkmf57\" title=\"\">wild political animals</a>\u201d were up to in London.</p> <p>\u201cHow ironic,\u201d says Pannick, \u201cthat the case arose in the context of Brexit, a political policy that its supporters justify by the wish to return sovereignty to parliament and to make our supreme court supreme over the European court of justice.\u201d</p> <p>Undeterred, Johnson and his henchman Dominic Cummings \u2013 or should it be Cummings and his henchman Johnson? \u2013 reacted by giving every impression of wanting to continue on their lawless path. Yes, the men at present running \u201cthe party of law and order\u201d carried on being dead set on \u201cdelivering Brexit\u201d, if necessary by lawless means. The joke going around at the moment is that this nation, ruled by a badly advised Queen and this shambles of a government, is no longer the United Kingdom but the United Kindergarten.</p> <p>Thank goodness that Johnson and Cummings were up to their tricks at the Conservative conference in Manchester when I visited No 10 Downing Street last week. I was there for the launch of Jack Brown\u2019s fascinating book <em>No 10 \u2013 The Geography of Power at Downing Street</em>, and bumping into my old acquaintance Johnson would certainly have spoiled the evening.</p> <p>Lord Donoughue, head of the No 10 policy unit for the Labour governments of the 1970s, was at the launch and amused the gathering by saying that in his day No 10 was almost certainly bugged. I am not sure that anyone in their right mind would want to bug conversations between Johnson and Cummings. We know quite enough about what they are up to already.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Apparently none other an authority than Dominic Cummings has conceded that \u201cthere is a strong democratic case\u201d for a second referendum</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One of the many bizarre aspects of it all is the monstrous lie that their mission is to satisfy a public desire to \u201chonour\u201d the results of the referendum, \u201cget Brexit done\u201d and then spend, spend, spend. The true nature of Johnson\u2019s economic plan was laid bare in an address he gave to American business executives on his recent trip to New York. Instead of meeting the many demands of our austerity-worn economy with a programme of tax-financed public spending, he is planning lower taxes, especially for the more prosperous element in society.</p> <p>True, at last week\u2019s Conservative conference there were all sorts of wild promises about magic money trees providing tens of billions in public spending. But who swallows this guff? Certainly not the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies, or the Office for Budget Responsibility, who are well aware that, thanks to a combination of austerity and the initial effects of the prospect of Brexit on investment and productivity, the scope for fulfilling these wild promises is somewhat limited.</p> <p>Perhaps the absurdity of the so-called One Nation future Johnson promises was epitomised by the way that a pledge of \u201c40 new hospitals\u201d was subsequently translated as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/29/from-40-hospitals-to-six-tories-nhs-numbers-dont-add-up\" title=\"\">renovation of half a dozen existing hospitals</a>. And, as medical professionals have quite rightly been pointing out in the past week, the really pressing need is to fill the gap in staff shortages in the National Health Service. This has been much aggravated by the distasteful and counterproductive Brexit campaign to make EU nationals on whom the NHS depends feel unwelcome.</p> <p>It remains my strong belief that the only sane course for this country is for better leaders than are at present in the saddle to acknowledge that going ahead with Brexit would be a historic mistake of gigantic proportions. It is not the referendum that should be honoured: it is the interests of the nation.</p> <p>Given all the accusations of \u201cproject fear\u201d now being made by the more extreme Brexiters, it is obvious that a straight revoking of article 50 would offend their like \u2013 and they would just love to stir up civil revolt. Therefore it would probably be judicious to hold another referendum. Apparently none other an authority than Cummings has conceded that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/04/brexit-crisis-boris-johnson-mps-bill-blocking-no-deal-eu-no-deal-parliament-politics-live?page=with:block-5d6fe11c8f081f0141f4db2c#block-5d6fe11c8f081f0141f4db2c\" title=\"\">there is a strong democratic case</a>\u201d for a second referendum. In his view, it would be to ensure public consent for Brexit. In my view, as the extent of Brexit damage becomes more evident by the day, it would be to ensure the reverse.</p> <p>Never forget that a mere 37% of the electorate voted Leave in 2016. Moreover, as the Irish prime minister has pointed out, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/03/eu-calls-on-boris-johnson-to-publish-brexit-plan-in-full\" title=\"\">recent polls now show a shift towards Remain</a>.</p>",

Lord Pannick QC, who triumphed in the case brought by the patriotic hero Gina Miller, recalls that he was on safari, watching wild animals in Botswana, when he heard what \u201cwild political animals\u201d were up to in London. \u201cHow ironic,\u201d says Pannick, \u201cthat the case arose in the context of Brexit, a political policy that its supporters justify by the wish to return sovereignty to parliament and to make our supreme court supreme over the European court of justice.\u201d Undeterred, Johnson and his henchman Dominic Cummings \u2013 or should it be Cummings and his henchman Johnson? \u2013 reacted by giving every impression of wanting to continue on their lawless path. Yes, the men at present running \u201cthe party of law and order\u201d carried on being dead set on \u201cdelivering Brexit\u201d, if necessary by lawless means. The joke going around at the moment is that this nation, ruled by a badly advised Queen and this shambles of a government, is no longer the United Kingdom but the United Kindergarten. Thank goodness that Johnson and Cummings were up to their tricks at the Conservative conference in Manchester when I visited No 10 Downing Street last week. I was there for the launch of Jack Brown\u2019s fascinating book No 10 \u2013 The Geography of Power at Downing Street, and bumping into my old acquaintance Johnson would certainly have spoiled the evening. Lord Donoughue, head of the No 10 policy unit for the Labour governments of the 1970s, was at the launch and amused the gathering by saying that in his day No 10 was almost certainly bugged. I am not sure that anyone in their right mind would want to bug conversations between Johnson and Cummings. We know quite enough about what they are up to already. One of the many bizarre aspects of it all is the monstrous lie that their mission is to satisfy a public desire to \u201chonour\u201d the results of the referendum, \u201cget Brexit done\u201d and then spend, spend, spend. The true nature of Johnson\u2019s economic plan was laid bare in an address he gave to American business executives on his recent trip to New York. Instead of meeting the many demands of our austerity-worn economy with a programme of tax-financed public spending, he is planning lower taxes, especially for the more prosperous element in society. True, at last week\u2019s Conservative conference there were all sorts of wild promises about magic money trees providing tens of billions in public spending. But who swallows this guff? Certainly not the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies, or the Office for Budget Responsibility, who are well aware that, thanks to a combination of austerity and the initial effects of the prospect of Brexit on investment and productivity, the scope for fulfilling these wild promises is somewhat limited. Perhaps the absurdity of the so-called One Nation future Johnson promises was epitomised by the way that a pledge of \u201c40 new hospitals\u201d was subsequently translated as the renovation of half a dozen existing hospitals. And, as medical professionals have quite rightly been pointing out in the past week, the really pressing need is to fill the gap in staff shortages in the National Health Service. This has been much aggravated by the distasteful and counterproductive Brexit campaign to make EU nationals on whom the NHS depends feel unwelcome. It remains my strong belief that the only sane course for this country is for better leaders than are at present in the saddle to acknowledge that going ahead with Brexit would be a historic mistake of gigantic proportions. It is not the referendum that should be honoured: it is the interests of the nation. Given all the accusations of \u201cproject fear\u201d now being made by the more extreme Brexiters, it is obvious that a straight revoking of article 50 would offend their like \u2013 and they would just love to stir up civil revolt. Therefore it would probably be judicious to hold another referendum. Apparently none other an authority than Cummings has conceded that \u201cthere is a strong democratic case\u201d for a second referendum. In his view, it would be to ensure public consent for Brexit. In my view, as the extent of Brexit damage becomes more evident by the day, it would be to ensure the reverse. Never forget that a mere 37% of the electorate voted Leave in 2016. Moreover, as the Irish prime minister has pointed out, recent polls now show a shift towards Remain.",

      "bodyText": "A hundred years ago the Harakmbut people were nearly wiped out. Inhabitants of a vast jungle region where Peru intersects with Brazil and Bolivia, the tribespeople were enslaved by rubber barons and murdered en masse, only surviving thanks to the help of Dominican missionaries. Now a new threat of extinction looms, and once again they are appealing to the Catholic church. As wildfires and deforestation drive the Amazon rainforest towards a tipping point beyond which it cannot recover, Yesica Patiachi, a Harakmbut leader from Peru, is heading to Rome to take part in an unprecedented synod of Catholic bishops from across the region. Although she is not a practising Catholic, the 32-year-old schoolteacher sees the church as a key ally to save the rainforest. \u201cEden is here in the Amazon and we are destroying it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe cannot pray to God when we are destroying his creation.\u201d Starting on Sunday, bishops from the nine South American nations that share the Amazon will meet in the Vatican to try and muster the spiritual and earthly forces to pull the world\u2019s largest rainforest back from the brink of destruction. One of the synod\u2019s organisers, Father Peter Hughes, said the three-week gathering would set out a new view of ecology based on Christian faith in God as the creator of a \u201ccommon home\u201d. Hughes said the Catholic church should firmly place itself alongside the region\u2019s indigenous people and defending their territorial rights and way of life. \u201cThe life of the [Amazon] people is intrinsically, inherently part of the territory. If the territory is injured, the people are injured,\u201d he said. Stretching from the Andes in the west to Brazil\u2019s Atlantic coast, the Amazon basin ecosystem faces a host of threats. Fires \u2013 many ignited deliberately \u2013 have surged across the region this year. In Brazil, whose territory includes the largest portion of the Amazon, blazes increased by 84% in August compared to the same period last year, and deforestation spiked in July to a level not seen in more than a decade. Rains in September have helped efforts to control the fires, but the aggressively anti-environmental rhetoric of Jair Bolsonaro continues to embolden land grabbers, loggers and miners to invade indigenous or protected land. Brazil\u2019s far-right president has repeatedly promised to open up indigenous territories for mining and development. The situation is equally dire in neighbouring Bolivia, where up to 4m hectares in the Chiquitano dry forest, Amazon and the Gran Chaco ecosystems have gone up in flames in the past two months. Environmentalists blame the leftwing president, Evo Morales, for legalising slash-and-burn fires to open up pastureland for cattle farming and beef exports to China. \u201cThe Amazon is witness to death and resurrection right now,\u201d said Hughes in the Peruvian capital Lima, where he has lived and worked for nearly 50 years. \u201cIt is a place of beauty, a place of immense marvel, providence, abundance of life on every level. But it\u2019s also a place of death, destruction, violence, ransacking, plunder and tremendous chaos.\u201d The Catholic church has had troubled history in Latin America. It was the ideological force for imperialism that brought death, disease and slavery. But Catholic priests have often side with indigenous people against invaders. Both sides of that history are palpable in Puerto Maldonado, which grew from a frontier rubber settlement during the 1902 rubber boom into a sprawling city powered by a modern-day gold rush. Looming large over the city is the most ruthless of all the rubber barons: Carlos Ferm\u00edn Fitzcarrald \u2013 the inspiration for Werner Herzog\u2019s 1982 film Fitzcarraldo. His name adorns the town\u2019s main avenue, schools and monuments; his memory is still vivid in a region where entire ethnic groups were decimated during the rubber boom. Harakmbut elders still tell how Fitzcarrald tricked thousands of tribespeople to meet on a river islet, where they were massacred. Bodies clogged the river, and sickened entire villages downstream. Survivors fled into the forest, emerging only after generations of their peers had died from violence and disease. \u201cFitzcarrald is no longer here but his spirit is in every oil company; it\u2019s in the logging and the illegal mining which destroys our forests,\u201d said Patiachi, one of several indigenous leaders invited to the synod by Pope Francis. Salvation came in the figure of a Dominican missionary, Father Jos\u00e9 \u00c1lvarez, who arrived in Madre de Dios in 1917, two decades after Fitzcarrald died. The Spanish priest helped protect the Harakmbut from rubber tappers, and came to be known as Apaktone, or \u201cold father\u201d. \u201cWe recognise Apaktone as the one who came to prevent the total extinction of the Harakmbut,\u201d said Patiachi. \u00c1lvarez\u2019s pastoral work in the 150,000 sq km Apostolic Diocese of Madre de Dios left its mark on Dominican followers including Peruvian priest Gustavo Guti\u00e9rrez, one of the founders of Liberation Theology, a distinctly Latin American movement, which teaches that Catholics must revive the biblical commitment to the poor. Puerto Maldonado was also the setting for Pope Francis\u2019s 2018 encounter with indigenous leaders, where the first Latin American pontiff warned that the Amazon was facing an unprecedented threat. Yet the church is rapidly losing followers as evangelical Protestant groups expand across the region. Fifty years ago nearly everybody in Latin America lived and died a Catholic; by 2014 69% of Latin Americans belonged to the church. One of the proposals the synod will consider is a change to the Catholic church\u2019s centuries-old requirement that priests must be celibate in order to allow the ordination of married men in remote areas of the Amazon. But organizers insist that the church is not simply fighting for its share in the market of souls. Cardinal Claudio Hummes, the president of the synod, said this week that the Amazon was facing a crisis in which ecological problems were inseparable from social issues. To find a solution, the world must hear \u201cboth the cry of the earth and that of the poor\u201d, he said. Xavier Arbex, a Swiss priest who has spent close to 40 years in Madre de Dios, said what the pope is proposing is \u201csocially and politically revolutionary\u201d. But half a lifetime defending human rights in the Amazon makes the 77-year-old cleric pessimistic the synod can impede the \u201csavage capitalism\u201d driving the destruction. \u201cThe synod will shine a light but it won\u2019t be enough to drive away the darkness,\u201d he said. Sixty miles west of Puerto Maldonado, storefront evangelical churches sit amid wooden shacks and bars in La Pampa, a frontier boomtown which sprang up around a recent gold rush. Since a government crackdown earlier this year, illegal miners have pushed deeper into the jungle, and the local economy is grinding to a halt. Sitting outside his roadside motorcycle repair shop, Samuel Tecse Barrios put it simply: \u201cThere\u2019s no work.\u201d Tecse Barrios belongs to the Israelite Mission of the New Universal Pact, a Peruvian doomsday sect that is just one of the Catholic church\u2019s competitors in the Amazon. Male members of the evangelical group grow long hair and beards while women cover their heads like nuns. With their colourful, flowing robes they look like overgrown cast members of a nativity play.

      "bodyText": "Bilbies have been reintroduced to the Mallee Cliffs national park in the far south-west of New South Wales in an effort to restore populations of the marsupial, which is regionally extinct in the state. Greater bilbies haven\u2019t been seen in the national park for more than a century. Last week, 30 that had been relocated from Thistle Island, off the coast of South Australia, were released into the park, protected by a predator-free enclosure that is the largest of its kind in the southern hemisphere. The 37.2km purpose-built fence has created an area of 9,570 hectares that will be cleared of predators such as feral cats and foxes that are a major threat to bilbies. The newly released animals are currently in a smaller area of 480 hectares while trappers remove predators from the main area. Once that work is complete it will be monitored for several months before it is declared feral-free. The predator-proof enclosure has been established by the Australian Wildlife Conservancy (AWC), in partnership with the NSW government. It is part of a larger project that will also see another nine regionally extinct species reintroduced to the national park. They include the western quoll, the numbat, the western barred bandicoot, the bridled nailtail wallaby, and the greater stick-nest rat. Laurence Berry, a wildlife ecologist with the AWC, said seven of the species would be released into the park in 2020. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning He said bilbies used to occur across 70% of the Australian mainland but they are now found in just 20% of their former range. Berry said the purpose of the enclosure was to try to boost the population of the species in both the short and longer term. \u201cIn the short term, it helps to just safeguard the species by establishing a population,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the long term, it\u2019s about creating a new population that\u2019s genetically different to the existing populations that gives them resilience into the long term.\u201d He said projects like predator-free fences were being used because longer-term solutions to eradicate feral animals were still being developed. Berry said the enclosure covered a huge area and, while it was still very early days, the bilbies seemed to be adjusting well to their new environment. \u201cThey\u2019re already digging burrows, there\u2019s evidence of digging on the ground, and they\u2019re foraging,\u201d he said. The NSW environment minister, Matt Kean, said the project was aimed at \u201cturning around the extinction rates for our native animals\u201d. \u201cBilbies are a loved and iconic Australian animal that has been extinct in the wild in NSW for over 100 years. We have an opportunity to bring them back to NSW national parks by using special fenced-off areas and it\u2019s important we do this,\u201d he said. Australia has the highest rate of mammal extinction in the world, which has been driven not only by threats such as predation by feral pests, but also large amounts of habitat loss. A federal Senate inquiry is currently examining Australia\u2019s high rates of fauna extinction. An interim report by the committee, produced before the May election, called for an overhaul of Australia\u2019s environment law \u2013 the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. A statutory review of the EPBC Act, which is undertaken every 10 years, is due to commence this month.",

It\u2019s time to say howdy to the latest ebike to roll into town \u2013 the Cowboy. However, you won\u2019t be needing spurs or a stetson for this ride. It\u2019s a super-chic, award-winning urban commuter that puts fine design, smooth lines and innovative technology in your hands at a (reasonably) affordable price. It\u2019s also from Belgium \u2013 not Texas.</p> <p>Founded in 2017 in Brussels, investors were so keen to hitch their wagon to founder and CEO Adrien Roose\u2019s proposed bike brand that Cowboy hit \u00a310m in its initial round of fundraising. Last month, Roose announced his firm was now ready to take its next step and expand into markets across Europe. The bikes are sold through the <a href=\"https://cowboy.com/\">website</a> direct to customers, but already there are more than 500 cycle shops signed up across the continent where repairs and maintenance can be carried out \u2013 not that they are expecting many of those. Having won Eurobike 2017 with its first working prototype, then the Red-Dot bicycle design award in 2018 for its second prototype and now the Red-Dot \u201cBest of the Best\u201d award for the 2019 model, there are few who would bet against Cowboy becoming an overnight hit.</p> <p>If you are tempted to sign up for one of the new bikes, don\u2019t imagine you are buying an untested ride. Just last month, Roose announced the firm had reached a milestone of 1,000,000 kilometers ridden on Cowboys. In keeping with the company\u2019s green credentials he was quick to point out that this equated to a saving of 112,944 kg CO2. \u201cWe see fantastic potential for electric bikes,\u201d he says, \u201cas cities continue to grow, traffic grinds to a halt and we look for ways to cut our carbon footprint.\u201d</p> <p>And it isn\u2019t only carbon you\u2019ll be saving. Ebikes save you money, too. A survey by Evans Cycles of 2,000 commuters estimated that by switching from car, bus, tube or train to ebikes, commuters could save an average of \u00a37,791 over five years, which is more than enough to justify the cost of buying a new ebike. The fact that the government\u2019s minister for cycling, Michael Ellis, recently clarified the that there was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2019/jun/11/could-the-cycle-to-work-scheme-start-an-ebike-revolution\">no longer a cap of \u00a31,000 on cycle to work scheme</a> \u2013 an announcement timed nicely to coincide with the scheme\u2019s 20th anniversary \u2013 means that ebikes that generally tend to start around the \u00a31,600 mark are now well within the reach of daily commuters.</p> <p>Cowboy has been designed to be sleek, agile and easy to use. Its battery weighs just 2.4kg (the whole bike tips the scales at 16.1kg) and can be quickly removed, so you can charge it at your desk before the journey home. Removing the battery is clearly also a massive anti-theft deterrent. Not that you will need to worry about it being stolen.

      "bodyText": "Cowboy ebike Price \u00a31,760, cowboy.com Weight 16.1kg Range 70km Brakes hydraulic disc Charge time 3.5 hours Maximum speed 15.5mph Yeehaw! It\u2019s time to say howdy to the latest ebike to roll into town \u2013 the Cowboy. However, you won\u2019t be needing spurs or a stetson for this ride. It\u2019s a super-chic, award-winning urban commuter that puts fine design, smooth lines and innovative technology in your hands at a (reasonably) affordable price. It\u2019s also from Belgium \u2013 not Texas. Founded in 2017 in Brussels, investors were so keen to hitch their wagon to founder and CEO Adrien Roose\u2019s proposed bike brand that Cowboy hit \u00a310m in its initial round of fundraising. Last month, Roose announced his firm was now ready to take its next step and expand into markets across Europe. The bikes are sold through the website direct to customers, but already there are more than 500 cycle shops signed up across the continent where repairs and maintenance can be carried out \u2013 not that they are expecting many of those. Having won Eurobike 2017 with its first working prototype, then the Red-Dot bicycle design award in 2018 for its second prototype and now the Red-Dot \u201cBest of the Best\u201d award for the 2019 model, there are few who would bet against Cowboy becoming an overnight hit. If you are tempted to sign up for one of the new bikes, don\u2019t imagine you are buying an untested ride. Just last month, Roose announced the firm had reached a milestone of 1,000,000 kilometers ridden on Cowboys. In keeping with the company\u2019s green credentials he was quick to point out that this equated to a saving of 112,944 kg CO2. \u201cWe see fantastic potential for electric bikes,\u201d he says, \u201cas cities continue to grow, traffic grinds to a halt and we look for ways to cut our carbon footprint.\u201d And it isn\u2019t only carbon you\u2019ll be saving. Ebikes save you money, too. A survey by Evans Cycles of 2,000 commuters estimated that by switching from car, bus, tube or train to ebikes, commuters could save an average of \u00a37,791 over five years, which is more than enough to justify the cost of buying a new ebike. The fact that the government\u2019s minister for cycling, Michael Ellis, recently clarified the that there was no longer a cap of \u00a31,000 on cycle to work scheme \u2013 an announcement timed nicely to coincide with the scheme\u2019s 20th anniversary \u2013 means that ebikes that generally tend to start around the \u00a31,600 mark are now well within the reach of daily commuters. Cowboy has been designed to be sleek, agile and easy to use. Its battery weighs just 2.4kg (the whole bike tips the scales at 16.1kg) and can be quickly removed, so you can charge it at your desk before the journey home. Removing the battery is clearly also a massive anti-theft deterrent. Not that you will need to worry about it being stolen. The bike is controlled via an app that provides you with a safe digital key to activate it. The live dashboard keeps you informed of the status of the ride in terms of speed, duration, distance and battery level. You can even use the app to turn the inbuilt lights on and off. The clever rear light brightens when you apply the brake \u2013 like a car or motorbike.

      "bodyText": "Summer harvest is mostly over, so October is the time to think about soil. A good month to clear and compost, to weed and hoe, but please remember to leave some crops to seed. Birds need the winter feed. We are an organic-only site so will mulch much of the plot. We will spread it after rain and leave it to lie on the soil\u2019s surface for worms to do their aerating work over the winter. This plot is a bit small for green manures \u2013 mainly because I can\u2019t seem to stop planting other things for spring \u2013 but we have had good results on other sites with various mixes of field beans, red clover, phacelia, vetch and Hungarian grazing rye (Secale cereale) to feed and break up the heavier ground. We will be planting onion sets and garlic this month or next, depending on weather, how much ground opens up and the greed of the pigeons. It is around now they\u2019ll return to attacking the sweeter young kale. Our chard will be next. They\u2019ll leave the radicchio and other bitter chicories until late winter or early spring \u2013though we are toying for the first time with using nets. Our simple rule with growing garlic is to break the bulbs and plant each clove in a sunny spot at twice its depth about a hand-width apart in rows a foot apart. I resist it every year, but love to see the young bright green shoots at a time such things are in short supply. We will also likely sow Super Aquadulce broad beans for much the same reason. I seem to have a near overwhelming need to keep the allotment (and me) alive. October is also a good time to divide rhubarb crowns or to plant new sets. Mostly though it is the perfect month to enjoy pottering about. Allan Jenkins\u2019s Morning (4th Estate, \u00a38.99) is out now. Order it for \u00a37.91 from guardianbookshop.com",

It\u2019s especially unnecessary when you have purse-friendly gems like this. I like the intense moisture (that\u2019s the avocado and shea butter) and love that it is non-sticky. The scent, a fresh orange, lemon oil and neroli concoction, is also a win. Its USP, however, is that it diminishes dark spots and regulates melanin production. We\u2019re all guilty of neglecting our hands \u2013 we don\u2019t treat them like the skin on our face and so they show the greatest signs of age and sun damage. This cream tackles that and the impressive stats back this up \u2013 92% of users found their dark spots significantly diminished over a couple of months. The secret is viniferine, a plant-based active ingredient 62 times more powerful than Vitamin C.

      "bodyText": "No one says, \u201cI\u2019d really love to perfect the ultimate smoky eye in green.\u201d However, this contemporary take on an old-schooler is worth considering. At Valentino AW19, Pat McGrath gave models smoky eyes in vivid purples, greens, reds\u2026 Tricky? Not if you keep it modern. Blend out the colour so the density peters out at the end. Add drops of highlighter to foundation: it gives skin life. Brush a clear brow gel into brows. End with barely there lips. This is one look where the hackneyed adage, \u201clips or eyes, not both\u201d is actually good advice. 1. Huda Beauty Matte Power Bullet in Girls Trip \u00a322, cultbeauty.co.uk 2.

Anastasia Beverly Hills Clear Brow Gel \u00a323, anastasiabeverlyhills.co.uk I can\u2019t do without... hand cream that reduces dark spots Some beauty categories are not worth spending huge sums on \u2013 mists, body lotions, hand creams\u2026 The majority are much of a muchness so, unless you are desperately trying to find a way to waste money, I\u2019d rarely venture into high double digits. It\u2019s especially unnecessary when you have purse-friendly gems like this. I like the intense moisture (that\u2019s the avocado and shea butter) and love that it is non-sticky. The scent, a fresh orange, lemon oil and neroli concoction, is also a win. Its USP, however, is that it diminishes dark spots and regulates melanin production. We\u2019re all guilty of neglecting our hands \u2013 we don\u2019t treat them like the skin on our face and so they show the greatest signs of age and sun damage. This cream tackles that and the impressive stats back this up \u2013 92% of users found their dark spots significantly diminished over a couple of months. The secret is viniferine, a plant-based active ingredient 62 times more powerful than Vitamin C.

      "body": "<p><strong>Moor Hall, Prescot Road, Aughton, Lancashire (01695 572511). Four-course tasting menu \u00a370, eight courses \u00a3140, wines from \u00a335</strong></p> <p>When booking to eat at Moor Hall in Lancashire, do pay attention to the terms and conditions. For example, while they minister to dietary requirements, they \u201ccannot cater for dislikes\u201d. As a restaurant critic I take this as a personal challenge: clearly, if I don\u2019t like anything it will be my fault, not theirs. They ask that you arrive 30 minutes before the booking time \u201cto experience the full Moor Hall journey\u201d. You may have thought you were going for lunch, but no. In the age of <em>X</em><em> Factor</em> we are all on a journey. A week before my booking, secured with a credit card, an email turns up repeating all of this and reminding me that if I cancel within seven days or fewer of that booking (a period which, given the date of the email, has already started), I will be charged \u00a3125 a head.</p> <p>I should be anticipating a cracking meal at a restaurant which, earlier this year, was named the best in Britain in the <a href=\"https://www.nationalrestaurantawards.co.uk/\" title=\"\">National Restaurant Awards</a>; which, just last month, made it into the <em><a href=\"https://www.thegoodfoodguide.co.uk/awards\" title=\"\">Good Food Guide</a></em><a href=\"https://www.thegoodfoodguide.co.uk/awards\" title=\"\">\u2019s</a> top five. Instead, I am on edge, fearful that I might let them down dreadfully, rather than the other way around.</p> <p>Before I\u2019m accused of lopping the head off tall poppies, let me cut straight to the vital information. Mark Birchall, who worked with Simon Rogan at<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/oct/23/jay-rayner-restaurant-enclume-cumbria\" title=\"\"> L\u2019Enclume</a>, is a gifted chef. I will not quickly forget the smoothest of whipped cod\u2019s roe, under a sheen of punchy chicken jelly, dotted with shimmering pearls of caviar, which came with crackers into which fronds of herb had been pressed, as if art-directed by Laura Ashley in her pomp. I will not forget a charcoal-black crisp pouch containing a liquid centre of black pudding. Given the many bejewelled accessories which attend the four-course tasting menu, stretching it closer to 10, I\u2019d argue the price tag, now \u00a370, is good value. It\u2019s housed in a grand manor house treated with huge care; the modern, sharp-edged dining room, with its theatrically visible kitchen, is light and calming.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"478412f364b7c85b5c52fb0cad671e08b8ddc6c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/478412f364b7c85b5c52fb0cad671e08b8ddc6c1/412_442_4738_2843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018As if art-directed by Laura Ashley in her pomp\u2019: cod\u2019s roe with caviar.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018As if art-directed by Laura Ashley in her pomp\u2019: cod\u2019s roe with caviar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaw &amp; Shaw/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But there\u2019s a gauche performance around it all which reeks of self-importance. Yes, I know: hello Mr Kettle have you met Mr Pot? But I\u2019m not charging you 70 quid for lunch. The problem is it deadens the whole experience. Mostly it\u2019s because the elements of the \u201cjourney\u201d they highlight are not the best of what they have. To start you must be taken to the lounge whether you wish to begin there or not. It\u2019s a nice touch that it\u2019s one of the brigade who serves you the first snack, a wooden block with curls of their own charcuterie. He describes them reverentially. And beautifully presented they are too: gossamer sliced on a machine in the lounge, and kept at room temperature. The problem is that two of them, particularly the coppa, are just massively salty and not especially good.</p> <p>After a few more snacks, a sombre waiter says our table is ready. It\u2019s a tease. We\u2019re still not allowed to go there. He insists we come out into the perfectly pleasant kitchen garden behind the building for the \u201cstart of our Moor Hall journey\u201d. This might have worked if it had been done with any enthusiasm, but the narration \u2013 \u201cThese courgettes go on our monkfish dish, here are fruits we use in desserts\u201d \u2013 is delivered in a bored monotone, like he\u2019s an undertaker who has trained long and hard to say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for your loss\u201d to the daily throng of clients. At the end he\u2019s about to take us on a \u201cjourney\u201d through the kitchen. I call a halt. I\u2019ve seen more than enough restaurant kitchens in my time. Please can I just go to my table? Apparently, yes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9068f4e2b44013d30e3d3cc5e69ff1a506202f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9068f4e2b44013d30e3d3cc5e69ff1a506202f0/232_281_5110_3067/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Sultry funk\u2019: beef tartare served with barbecued celeriac and a dollop of mustard.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Sultry funk\u2019: beef tartare served with barbecued celeriac and a dollop of mustard.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaw &amp; Shaw/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Once there, another cook is dispatched tableside to prepare a dish complete with narration: here\u2019s a poached oyster, there\u2019s fennel a couple of ways, ooh, a bit of lardo, a squirt of dill oil, puffed quinoa and a buttermilk dressing. Tweezers are involved. It\u2019s all robustly performative. But the dish itself is just a little bland. None of the ingredients punch through. You can throw in a floor show if you insist, but if the dish itself isn\u2019t up to scratch no volume of \u201cTa da!\u201d will improve it.</p> <p>Eventually the meal begins and much of it really is exceptional. Warm, springy sourdough comes with cultured butter, the deep green of garden peas blitzed with herbs. The sweetest of carrots are interleaved with leaves of a crisp carrot caramel. There are dollops of silky pur\u00e9e and gratings of salty <a href=\"https://www.doddingtoncheese.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Doddington</a> cheese. Pieces of warm, intense crab-claw meat come in a limpid smoked turnip broth, with a pillow of smooth brown meat; there are roasted beetroots under a snowfall of grated frozen horseradish. A deep-fried potato basket is filled with the oily hit of smoked eel, tempered by the acidity of fermented garlic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"702e72cfee63bc6ff1f003ca5b9b843a5dc657a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/702e72cfee63bc6ff1f003ca5b9b843a5dc657a3/672_671_3981_2389/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Crunchy sugarwork\u2019: wild blackberries.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Crunchy sugarwork\u2019: wild blackberries.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaw &amp; Shaw/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is a tartare of 80-day aged beef, with the sultry funk of barbecued celeriac and a dollop of mustard. Before the main courses, they bring the flakiest of onion pastries, which drops golden crumbs everywhere. These must be chased around the bare wooden table with fat fingertips before the fiercely suited man with the table broom comes. Alongside a solid chicken main is a pot of chicken \u201crag\u00f9\u201d which is dark and sticky like the very best bits at the bottom of the roasting pan. The pre-dessert is a perfect scoop of gingerbread ice-cream, atop a little ginger in thick syrup, and laid with the finest sticks of crisp gingerbread tuile, as though a game of Kerplunk has collapsed. Wild blackberries come with a foamy woodruff mousse and crunchy sugarwork.</p> <p>We have, at times, eaten exceptionally well, as we should when the bill for two with one glass of fizz each is topping \u00a3100 a head. But throughout I have been on edge, fearful that our nice lunch will be interrupted by another bit of that \u201cjourney\u201d. Mostly what travels are the plates, which we get to watch being paraded around the dining room for multiple, prim inspections. Guys, just bring us the food. Don\u2019t get me wrong. The cooking at Moor Hall deserves to be taken very seriously indeed. But it would be a much better restaurant if it stopped taking itself so damn seriously.</p> <h2>News bites</h2> <p>If the whole \u2018food as story\u2019 thing intrigues you, there are spaces available throughout October at the Fat Duck in Bray for what they call \u2018The Journey\u2019, a multi-course menu with nods to <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>, and sweeties dispensed from an ornate clockwork dolls\u2019 house. The availability may be related to the fact it now costs \u00a3325 a head, prepaid. From November they are running a menu for the Christmas period called The Fable, at \u00a3375 a head. I am merely the messenger (<em><a href=\"https://www.thefatduck.co.uk/\">thefatduck.co.uk</a></em>).</p> <p>To mark the Rugby World Cup, the Japanese-inspired conveyor belt chain Yo! has introduced a set of dishes inspired by the home nations. These include fish and chips nigiri sushi with wasabi peas for England and a haggis and carrot California roll for Scotland. Once again, I am only the messenger (<em><a href=\"https://yosushi.com/\">yosushi.com</a></em>).</p> <p>Interesting development: the original Ivy on London\u2019s West Street, famed for being one of the toughest rooms in which to bag a table, has started targeted advertising via Facebook. The business has also recently been brought inside the \u2018Ivy Collection\u2019 group of branded caf\u00e9s and brasseries. Until now it had been kept entirely separate from the spin-offs.</p> <p><em>Jay Rayner\u2019s book, My Last Supper: One Meal, a Lifetime in the Making, is published by Guardian Faber at \u00a316.99.

      "bodyText": "Moor Hall, Prescot Road, Aughton, Lancashire (01695 572511). Four-course tasting menu \u00a370, eight courses \u00a3140, wines from \u00a335 When booking to eat at Moor Hall in Lancashire, do pay attention to the terms and conditions. For example, while they minister to dietary requirements, they \u201ccannot cater for dislikes\u201d. As a restaurant critic I take this as a personal challenge: clearly, if I don\u2019t like anything it will be my fault, not theirs. They ask that you arrive 30 minutes before the booking time \u201cto experience the full Moor Hall journey\u201d. You may have thought you were going for lunch, but no. In the age of X Factor we are all on a journey. A week before my booking, secured with a credit card, an email turns up repeating all of this and reminding me that if I cancel within seven days or fewer of that booking (a period which, given the date of the email, has already started), I will be charged \u00a3125 a head. I should be anticipating a cracking meal at a restaurant which, earlier this year, was named the best in Britain in the National Restaurant Awards; which, just last month, made it into the Good Food Guide\u2019s top five. Instead, I am on edge, fearful that I might let them down dreadfully, rather than the other way around. Before I\u2019m accused of lopping the head off tall poppies, let me cut straight to the vital information. Mark Birchall, who worked with Simon Rogan at L\u2019Enclume, is a gifted chef. I will not quickly forget the smoothest of whipped cod\u2019s roe, under a sheen of punchy chicken jelly, dotted with shimmering pearls of caviar, which came with crackers into which fronds of herb had been pressed, as if art-directed by Laura Ashley in her pomp. I will not forget a charcoal-black crisp pouch containing a liquid centre of black pudding. Given the many bejewelled accessories which attend the four-course tasting menu, stretching it closer to 10, I\u2019d argue the price tag, now \u00a370, is good value. It\u2019s housed in a grand manor house treated with huge care; the modern, sharp-edged dining room, with its theatrically visible kitchen, is light and calming. But there\u2019s a gauche performance around it all which reeks of self-importance. Yes, I know: hello Mr Kettle have you met Mr Pot? But I\u2019m not charging you 70 quid for lunch. The problem is it deadens the whole experience. Mostly it\u2019s because the elements of the \u201cjourney\u201d they highlight are not the best of what they have. To start you must be taken to the lounge whether you wish to begin there or not. It\u2019s a nice touch that it\u2019s one of the brigade who serves you the first snack, a wooden block with curls of their own charcuterie. He describes them reverentially. And beautifully presented they are too: gossamer sliced on a machine in the lounge, and kept at room temperature. The problem is that two of them, particularly the coppa, are just massively salty and not especially good. After a few more snacks, a sombre waiter says our table is ready. It\u2019s a tease. We\u2019re still not allowed to go there. He insists we come out into the perfectly pleasant kitchen garden behind the building for the \u201cstart of our Moor Hall journey\u201d. This might have worked if it had been done with any enthusiasm, but the narration \u2013 \u201cThese courgettes go on our monkfish dish, here are fruits we use in desserts\u201d \u2013 is delivered in a bored monotone, like he\u2019s an undertaker who has trained long and hard to say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for your loss\u201d to the daily throng of clients. At the end he\u2019s about to take us on a \u201cjourney\u201d through the kitchen. I call a halt. I\u2019ve seen more than enough restaurant kitchens in my time. Please can I just go to my table? Apparently, yes. Once there, another cook is dispatched tableside to prepare a dish complete with narration: here\u2019s a poached oyster, there\u2019s fennel a couple of ways, ooh, a bit of lardo, a squirt of dill oil, puffed quinoa and a buttermilk dressing. Tweezers are involved. It\u2019s all robustly performative. But the dish itself is just a little bland. None of the ingredients punch through. You can throw in a floor show if you insist, but if the dish itself isn\u2019t up to scratch no volume of \u201cTa da!\u201d will improve it. Eventually the meal begins and much of it really is exceptional. Warm, springy sourdough comes with cultured butter, the deep green of garden peas blitzed with herbs. The sweetest of carrots are interleaved with leaves of a crisp carrot caramel. There are dollops of silky pur\u00e9e and gratings of salty Doddington cheese. Pieces of warm, intense crab-claw meat come in a limpid smoked turnip broth, with a pillow of smooth brown meat; there are roasted beetroots under a snowfall of grated frozen horseradish. A deep-fried potato basket is filled with the oily hit of smoked eel, tempered by the acidity of fermented garlic. There is a tartare of 80-day aged beef, with the sultry funk of barbecued celeriac and a dollop of mustard. Before the main courses, they bring the flakiest of onion pastries, which drops golden crumbs everywhere. These must be chased around the bare wooden table with fat fingertips before the fiercely suited man with the table broom comes. Alongside a solid chicken main is a pot of chicken \u201crag\u00f9\u201d which is dark and sticky like the very best bits at the bottom of the roasting pan. The pre-dessert is a perfect scoop of gingerbread ice-cream, atop a little ginger in thick syrup, and laid with the finest sticks of crisp gingerbread tuile, as though a game of Kerplunk has collapsed. Wild blackberries come with a foamy woodruff mousse and crunchy sugarwork. We have, at times, eaten exceptionally well, as we should when the bill for two with one glass of fizz each is topping \u00a3100 a head. But throughout I have been on edge, fearful that our nice lunch will be interrupted by another bit of that \u201cjourney\u201d. Mostly what travels are the plates, which we get to watch being paraded around the dining room for multiple, prim inspections. Guys, just bring us the food. Don\u2019t get me wrong. The cooking at Moor Hall deserves to be taken very seriously indeed. But it would be a much better restaurant if it stopped taking itself so damn seriously. News bites If the whole \u2018food as story\u2019 thing intrigues you, there are spaces available throughout October at the Fat Duck in Bray for what they call \u2018The Journey\u2019, a multi-course menu with nods to Alice in Wonderland, and sweeties dispensed from an ornate clockwork dolls\u2019 house. The availability may be related to the fact it now costs \u00a3325 a head, prepaid. From November they are running a menu for the Christmas period called The Fable, at \u00a3375 a head. I am merely the messenger (thefatduck.co.uk). To mark the Rugby World Cup, the Japanese-inspired conveyor belt chain Yo! has introduced a set of dishes inspired by the home nations. These include fish and chips nigiri sushi with wasabi peas for England and a haggis and carrot California roll for Scotland. Once again, I am only the messenger (yosushi.com). Interesting development: the original Ivy on London\u2019s West Street, famed for being one of the toughest rooms in which to bag a table, has started targeted advertising via Facebook. The business has also recently been brought inside the \u2018Ivy Collection\u2019 group of branded caf\u00e9s and brasseries. Until now it had been kept entirely separate from the spin-offs.

This, she believes, is integral to connecting with the target customer. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any other contemporary luxury brands with a designer approach in California. It\u2019s mostly surf brands or boho. So it\u2019s a wonderful lifestyle message we can get across. This woman who enjoys luxurious fabrics, like silk and cashmere, but wears them in a relaxed way. She is still very sure of herself, but her attitude is more effortless.\u201d</p> <p>Belhumeur may have creative free rein, but sprinkling rays of Cali sunshine over everything from the photography on the e-commerce site to the interior design of 50 physical shops worldwide is no mean feat. \u201cOnline is easy. It\u2019s like, \u2018This is the story we\u2019re telling,\u2019 we can make changes that are immediate and gratifying,\u201d she explains. \u201cThe stores are more of a challenge\u2026 looking at an old store and being, like, \u2018Oh no, I don\u2019t want to see it like this!\u2019 But you have to be patient.\u201d</p> <p>On the recent agenda was an in-store magazine championing Californian artists, writers and filmmakers, and the unveiling of Vince\u2019s flagship London store, for which she has sourced 1970s furniture, \u201cso it will feel like somewhere you want to hang out.\u201d It\u2019s an approach tested by the brand\u2019s Palisades store, which hosts Shibori tie-dye classes as well as craft workshops. \u201cYou want it to be a place where people can chill,\u201d she says. </p> <p>If her decade at Club Monaco (the Ralph Lauren-owned casual Canadian brand) is anything to go by, the future of Vince is in safe hands. \u201cWhen I joined Club Monaco in 2008 there was a great love for the brand, but it had gone off course and lost its way,\u201d she explains. \u201cOver the years I was able to put that back together and reinvent it, but still keep the core of what it started off as.</p> <p>\u201cIn the 1990s, everyone was still wearing colour, patterns and big shoulders from the 1980s,\u201d she continues. \u201cClub Monaco was simple clothing for people who didn\u2019t want to wear that. It was very black and white. It was a place I would go to in the 1990s in New York because I\u2019d want a black cardie or a white cotton shirt. There was nowhere to get them other than the more expensive Maison Margiela or Helmut Lang, which I couldn\u2019t afford.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Vince woman is very sure of herself, but her attitude is effortless</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Before Club Monaco and after Calvin Klein, Belhumeur worked for menswear brands in New York and then launched her own men\u2019s line for British label Fenn, Wright and Mason. \u201cThat\u2019s where I started going on trips to Asia and India and learning about sweater layouts in factories,\u201d she says. \u201cI also got to work in a lot of Italian mills on fabrics. Fitting men\u2019s clothes is a very precise thing, so I learned all about tailoring.\u201d</p> <p>By the time she went freelance and started a family in 1995, Belhumeur and her artist husband, Christopher, considered \u201ca run-down Victorian house\u201d in Westchester County, an hour-and-a-half north of New York City \u2013 their home. \u201cWe had no money and three kids running around, smashing into walls and jumping on the furniture. But I loved having that time with them.\u201d</p> <p>Selling it last year might have been \u201ca bit of a wrench\u201d, but Belhumeur sounds taken with her new home on the east side of the Hollywood Hills: \u201cThe pace is a little slower. It makes me think, \u2018Why was I running around so much like a crazy woman?\u2019 I was talking to my daughter about how people show off about how hard they work in New York, as if it\u2019s something to be proud of. In LA, people are proud of saying, \u2018I got away with working only this many hours today!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>On a typical day, Belhumeur will rise at 6.30am for an hour-long hike in nearby Griffith Park before driving to the office. She may feel an affinity with her current surroundings because they remind her of where she grew up. \u201cI was in the deepest countryside, which as a teenager I hated, because I wanted to go and see my friends and they were miles away,\u201d she says.</p> <p>It was an outdoorsy but crafty upbringing. Belhumeur\u2019s father was a pilot who was always travelling and returning home with blankets from Morocco and Spanish dolls, and her mother \u201cwas always making things\u201d. Often dragged to the local haberdashery shop, Belhumeur was taught to yarn and knit by her mother, which was more proactive than the career advice she got at school.</p> <p>\u201cI told them, \u2018Well, I like art,\u2019 and they said, \u2018Maybe you could do cake decorating or something like that.\u2019 It was only when I looked through the college prospectus and saw Kingston had a free trip to Paris at the end, I thought, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ll do that then.\u2019\u201d Like Vince itself: so simple.</p> <p><em>Vince, 169 Draycott Avenue, </em><em>London SW3 (<a href=\"https://www.vince.com/\" title=\"\">vince.com</a>)</em></p>",

But I loved having that time with them.\u201d Selling it last year might have been \u201ca bit of a wrench\u201d, but Belhumeur sounds taken with her new home on the east side of the Hollywood Hills: \u201cThe pace is a little slower. It makes me think, \u2018Why was I running around so much like a crazy woman?\u2019 I was talking to my daughter about how people show off about how hard they work in New York, as if it\u2019s something to be proud of. In LA, people are proud of saying, \u2018I got away with working only this many hours today!\u2019\u201d On a typical day, Belhumeur will rise at 6.30am for an hour-long hike in nearby Griffith Park before driving to the office. She may feel an affinity with her current surroundings because they remind her of where she grew up. \u201cI was in the deepest countryside, which as a teenager I hated, because I wanted to go and see my friends and they were miles away,\u201d she says. It was an outdoorsy but crafty upbringing. Belhumeur\u2019s father was a pilot who was always travelling and returning home with blankets from Morocco and Spanish dolls, and her mother \u201cwas always making things\u201d. Often dragged to the local haberdashery shop, Belhumeur was taught to yarn and knit by her mother, which was more proactive than the career advice she got at school. \u201cI told them, \u2018Well, I like art,\u2019 and they said, \u2018Maybe you could do cake decorating or something like that.\u2019 It was only when I looked through the college prospectus and saw Kingston had a free trip to Paris at the end, I thought, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ll do that then.\u2019\u201d Like Vince itself: so simple.

      "body": "<p>Major sports events tend to follow the same, inviolable narrative. In the build-up, the projections are universally doom-laden. Media reports focus on the dubious circumstances under which the host city was awarded the prize (the process, whichever sport we\u2019re discussing, is always dubious). There are invariably problems with the stadiums, which are either behind schedule and over budget or over budget and completed with a disregard to working conditions and human life.</p> <p>But then the action starts and the mood shifts. We forget many of the pre-tournament snags and are overwhelmed, at last, by the awe-inspiring performances of the competitors. Millions of us come together, reminded of the strange fact that nothing unites our nation quite as sport does.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/30/doha-world-athletics-championships-crowds-iaaf\" title=\"\">World Athletics Championships in Doha,</a> Qatar have not followed this preordained arc. The event certainly had the pessimistic build-up. Qatar in September and October, when the temperatures typically exceed 38C (100F) every day, is clearly not an obvious place to host a track-and-field meeting. There were fears that the Khalifa stadium, which holds 40,000 people, would be half-empty. There were grave concerns about hosting the championships in an Islamic state where homosexuality is illegal. Eyebrows were raised over how Doha was awarded the event over more logical venues, namely Eugene, Oregon, and Barcelona. The decisive factor was <a href=\"https://www.euroweeklynews.com/2019/10/01/empty-seats-and-ghostly-silence-have-been-the-sad-feature-of-doha-world-athletics-championships/\" title=\"\">an 11th-hour promise </a>to pay \u00a323.5m in sponsorship and build 10 new tracks around the world.</p> <p>So yes, there was the troubled preamble in spades. But where the 2019 World Championships have ripped up the script is what has happened since the competition started. We haven\u2019t had the feelgood bounce. Some of the problems were anticipated. Namely, that many of the athletics greats of recent times were not in Doha: Usain Bolt has retired; Mo Farah decided to run the Chicago marathon instead; the South African 400m star Wayde van Niekerk is injured.</p> <p>But it is not these high-profile absentees who have hamstrung this year\u2019s championships.

      "bodyText": "Major sports events tend to follow the same, inviolable narrative. In the build-up, the projections are universally doom-laden. Media reports focus on the dubious circumstances under which the host city was awarded the prize (the process, whichever sport we\u2019re discussing, is always dubious). There are invariably problems with the stadiums, which are either behind schedule and over budget or over budget and completed with a disregard to working conditions and human life. But then the action starts and the mood shifts. We forget many of the pre-tournament snags and are overwhelmed, at last, by the awe-inspiring performances of the competitors. Millions of us come together, reminded of the strange fact that nothing unites our nation quite as sport does. The World Athletics Championships in Doha, Qatar have not followed this preordained arc. The event certainly had the pessimistic build-up. Qatar in September and October, when the temperatures typically exceed 38C (100F) every day, is clearly not an obvious place to host a track-and-field meeting. There were fears that the Khalifa stadium, which holds 40,000 people, would be half-empty. There were grave concerns about hosting the championships in an Islamic state where homosexuality is illegal. Eyebrows were raised over how Doha was awarded the event over more logical venues, namely Eugene, Oregon, and Barcelona. The decisive factor was an 11th-hour promise to pay \u00a323.5m in sponsorship and build 10 new tracks around the world. So yes, there was the troubled preamble in spades. But where the 2019 World Championships have ripped up the script is what has happened since the competition started. We haven\u2019t had the feelgood bounce. Some of the problems were anticipated. Namely, that many of the athletics greats of recent times were not in Doha: Usain Bolt has retired; Mo Farah decided to run the Chicago marathon instead; the South African 400m star Wayde van Niekerk is injured. But it is not these high-profile absentees who have hamstrung this year\u2019s championships. The real issue is that it has been impossible for the athletes who did make it to Doha to compete with the drama that is happening off the track. Probably the main talking point has been the four-year ban for doping violations given last week to Alberto Salazar, a coach best known in the UK for working with Farah from 2010 to 2017. There was further controversy when the men\u2019s 100m final was won by Christian Coleman, an American who narrowly dodged a two-year ban for missing three drugs tests in one year. And yet, even though the World Championships have been a promotional car crash for athletics, there have still been jump-off-the-sofa, high-five-the-dog moments. For British viewers specifically, these were the performances of the double-barrelled double act of Dina Asher-Smith and Katarina Johnson-Thompson.

My books come from the library, my clothes from the wonderful charity shops, my creative energies (eg collage) from magazines, newspapers \u2013 anything I can recycle into sometimes beautiful images. I must confess one luxury: the Guardian and Observer newspapers. But those I pass on to a friend! Jude McGowan London W7 With a Bojo, it\u2019s all relative Thank you John Naughton for your lucid explanation of quantum theory (\u201cWe\u2019re a long way from making a quantum leap in web code-breaking\u201d, New Review). This proves our prime minister is, in fact, a subatomic particle \u2013 a Bojo. With superposition, as with Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s imaginary cat, he can simultaneously be in front of the press and not be in front of the press. His speech can be restrained and racist with no contradiction. But the Bojo\u2019s speciality must be its facility for entanglement, as women around the globe (if not galaxy) can testify. With a Bojo in command, we can wave goodbye to those outdated certainties of truth, honesty and rational discussion. Now, everything is relative and up for grabs. Tom Lerwill Oswestry, Shropshire",

The chief executive, Carrie Lam, provoked a wave of fear and fury on Friday with a ban on face masks at any public gathering, brought in under the emergency regulations ordinance, which had not been used for more than half a century. She also hinted authorities were considering harsher measures, including a curfew and delays to local elections set for November. The legislation gives her government virtually unlimited powers to do anything it considers necessary for public order. The ban on masks was the government\u2019s latest attempt to stop escalating protests that have swept through the city and transfixed the world. In four months of protests Lam has made only one concession \u2013 withdrawing the extradition bill that originally brought people on to the streets \u2013 but it was widely seen as too little, too late. The movement has five demands now, including an independent inquiry into police brutality and more democracy for the city. Protesters called a day of rest on Saturday, before a large march against the ban on Sunday, but the city was still on edge. The entire MTR metro network, with typically more than 4m trips a day, was shuttered apart from the airport express. It was partially reopened on Sunday ahead of more demonstrations expected later in the day. Also on Sunday, opposition lawmakers sought an emergency injunction in a bid to overturn the face mask ban. \u201cI would say this is one of the most important constitutional cases in the history of Hong Kong,\u201d lawmaker Dennis Kwok told reporters outside court on Sunday. \u201cThis could be the very last constitutional fight on our part. In the name of law they are trying to hurt the people and they try to crush the opposition. \u201cIf this emergency law just gets a pass just like that Hong Kong will be deemed into a very black hole.\u201d Many shops and supermarkets closed early on Saturday, and even the 7-Eleven convenience stores that are a staple of city life and usually open around the clock, said they would shut in the afternoon. Queues formed at ATMs in the morning, and food shops that were still open were busier than normal. In the afternoon a small, peaceful crowd marched across Hong Kong island, but there were no major demonstrations. Lam put out a pre-recorded video message, accusing protesters of \u201chalf-paralysing\u201d the city, and plunging it into a \u201cvery dark night\u201d. Flanked by all her ministers, who stood silent as Lam spoke, she called on the city\u2019s 7.5 million citizens to back her. \u201cThe extreme violence clearly illustrated that Hong Kong\u2019s public safety is widely endangered,\u201d Lam said, in her first comments since Friday\u2019s ban. Crowds had taken to the streets soon after she announced the ban, effective overnight. Face masks have become a staple at protests, partly because of heavy teargas use and partly because people fear arrest or retaliation if they are identified. Protesters set fire to two metro stations and vandalised shops and businesses considered pro-China; police responded with teargas, and a 14-year-old student was shot in the thigh with a live round. He was taken to hospital in a serious condition. On Saturday, police sent text messages urging the public to avoid protests over the three-day weekend. But despite the transport difficulties, and the fact that Sunday\u2019s protest had not got a police permit, large numbers were expected to turn out. Secondary school students also launched a petition, calling on police not to punish or report them for wearing a mask. The Chinese ambassador to the UK said Beijing would not hesitate to intervene if it thought it was necessary. Despite the worst outbreak of violence yet over the last week, and the shooting of two teenage students with live ammunition, he claimed the situation had improved and denied Lam had lost control. \u201cIf the situation in Hong Kong becomes uncontrollable by Hong Kong government, the central government will not sit on their hands and watch,\u201d Liu Xiaoming told the BBC\u2019s Newsnight. He added: \u201c(At present) the situation is still under control and we have full trust in the Hong Kong government and the chief executive.\u201d",

Instead, the focus is on the intense romance between Mirren and Jason Clarke as Grigory Potemkin, long before he became a battleship yet still handsome and proud. There\u2019s real fire between the two (historians disagree on whether they ever married), and hence the bigger tale, of all the Russias and all the wars, is thence allowed to come to the Winter Palace.

On one hand, Peter Bowker (<em>Marvellous</em>, <em>The A Word</em>) is an exceptional writer. On the other, this couldn\u2019t escape its cliches.</p> <p>The US war reporter (Helen Hunt), all attitude in feisty houndstooth-check slacks; the super-talented black sax player in Paris (Parker Sawyers); the stoic Mancunian (Sean Bean) peddling <em>Peace News</em> in vain with the pretty but poor daughter who says things such as \u201cnowt to be ashamed of, shell shock t\u2019ain\u2019t\u201d and is having the dirty done on her by her posh translator boyfriend, despite having the voice of an angel when she stands in front of a period-perfect prop microphone.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttVQ_C8gvRg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ttVQ_C8gvRg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttVQ_C8gvRg\">Watch a trailer for World on Fire.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>It\u2019s done with some subtlety, admittedly, and some class \u2013 notably <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/may/13/lesley-manville-go-dancing-drink-too-much-over-60-bafta-nominee-mum\" title=\"\">Lesley Manville</a>, playing a horrendous snob mother to said translator (at the moment Harry, played by Jonah Hauer-King, is little more than a handsome cipher). And the scenes of war in Danzig (Gda\u0144sk) are disturbing and credible.

The result is a brief but serious retrospective treatment of five pieces, going back as far as 1958. There are two versions of Naima and three of Village Blues, but they\u2019re all different, and every performance is complete, no odds and ends. The piece called Blue World here is an improvisation on the song Out of This World, which Coltrane had recorded in 1962, and for sheer intensity this version comes close to surpassing even that. As for the sound quality, it was recorded at Rudy Van Gelder\u2019s studio, by the man himself, in mono, which has been delicately tweaked and runs for 37 minutes.",

It\u2019s not as easy as it sounds. Des Grieux can so often seem like a drip; he wanders in, moons around a bit, and then agrees to share her with a powerful rich man (Monsieur GM) before changing his mind, failing to cheat successfully at cards, and then letting her die in his arms in the swamps of Louisiana when she\u2019s deported as a prostitute.</p> <p>But the choreographer Kenneth MacMillan carved Des Grieux out of fine, aching arabesques, delicate curves and jumps of youthful longing, rapid spins of emotion, and Muntigarov pins them to the air with absolute exactitude. He makes the steps speak, acting with every muscle in his body, conveying precisely a noble nature and a tender heart. He combines this with a face that conveys every flicker of feeling; he can\u2019t quite believe he has caught this wonderful creature and he can\u2019t bear losing her.</p> <p>In their scenes together, Sarah Lamb as Manon matches this rounded portrayal beat for beat.

The production, which is busy and full of action, felt both under-emphatic and over-acted.

That\u2019s exactly what happened on Saturday night in New York, though the message might not be what the former unified middleweight champion had in mind.</p> <p>The crowd-pleasing Kazakh known as Triple G was pushed like rarely seen before, looking every bit his 37 years in scratching through a heart-stopping challenge from the dogged Sergiy Derevyanchenko to regain the vacant IBF middleweight championship by a close but unanimous decision, a verdict that for Golovkin\u2019s immense popularity left many in the Madison Square Garden crowd dissatisfied as they filed into the concourses.

The fight of the year, surely, working both as a tribute to the sport and a reminder we\u2019re insane for watching it.</p> <p>\u201cThis is huge experience for me,\u201d said Golovkin, the longtime champion who made a division-record 20 title defenses at 160lbs before a controversial defeat on points in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/16/canelo-alvarez-gennady-golovkin-fight-report\">last year\u2019s blockbuster rematch with Canelo \u00c1lvarez</a>. \u201cRight now, I understand I need more focus [on] boxing. This was a tough fight. I need a little bit more. I need to still get stronger in my camp. Just more serious. I need to work hard. I need a little bit more focus.\u201d</p> <p>Golovkin (40-1-1, 35 KOs), who went off as a 4-1 favorite, dropped Derevyanchenko with a left hand in the first round, then appeared bound for yet another win inside the distance after his 33-year-old opponent suffered a bad cut on his right eye in the second.</p> <p>But Derevyanchenko (13-2, 10 KOs), perhaps confronting the gravity of the wound and sensing time was short, burst from his corner to start the third and immediately shifted the tenor with aggressive volume punching, rushing pell-mell into the pocket and letting his hands go with shots from a variety of angles. Having suffered his lone professional defeat when he fought for the same belt against Daniel Jacobs last November, Derevyanchenko, who featured alongside Vasyl Lomachenko and Oleksandr Usyk on Ukraine\u2019s 2012 Olympic team, appeared hell-bent on not letting his second title shot go to waste.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b7c3fc70431bed1bded74be37c771cb5669803e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7c3fc70431bed1bded74be37c771cb5669803e2/0_0_2848_1897/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gennady Golovkin v Sergiy Derevyanchenko\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gennady Golovkin knocks down Sergiy Derevyanchenko during the first round of Saturday\u2019s middleweight title fight.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Camporeale/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Golovkin was able to catch the swarming Derevyanchenko time and again with chopping shots on the way in, but Brooklyn-based Ukrainian was getting the better of the exchanges in the fourth. Both had their moments in the fifth but it was Derevyanchenko who took command late in the frame, caving in Golovkin\u2019s rib cage with a devastating body shot that left the Kazakh breathless.

      "bodyText": "Gennady Golovkin was out to make a statement in his first world title fight in more than a year. That\u2019s exactly what happened on Saturday night in New York, though the message might not be what the former unified middleweight champion had in mind. The crowd-pleasing Kazakh known as Triple G was pushed like rarely seen before, looking every bit his 37 years in scratching through a heart-stopping challenge from the dogged Sergiy Derevyanchenko to regain the vacant IBF middleweight championship by a close but unanimous decision, a verdict that for Golovkin\u2019s immense popularity left many in the Madison Square Garden crowd dissatisfied as they filed into the concourses. Ringside judges Eric Marlinski and Kevin Morgan scored it 115-112, while Frank Lombardi had it 114-113. (The Guardian scored it 115-112 to Golovkin.) It\u2019s likely each man lost something he will never get back after these extraordinary 47 minutes, a gruesome exhibition of two-way action where Golovkin absorbed more blows than any previous fight in his career while Derevyanchenko\u2019s eyes were bludgeoned to fissures, the grim toll of his relentless pressure approach. The fight of the year, surely, working both as a tribute to the sport and a reminder we\u2019re insane for watching it. \u201cThis is huge experience for me,\u201d said Golovkin, the longtime champion who made a division-record 20 title defenses at 160lbs before a controversial defeat on points in last year\u2019s blockbuster rematch with Canelo \u00c1lvarez. \u201cRight now, I understand I need more focus [on] boxing. This was a tough fight. I need a little bit more. I need to still get stronger in my camp. Just more serious. I need to work hard. I need a little bit more focus.\u201d Golovkin (40-1-1, 35 KOs), who went off as a 4-1 favorite, dropped Derevyanchenko with a left hand in the first round, then appeared bound for yet another win inside the distance after his 33-year-old opponent suffered a bad cut on his right eye in the second. But Derevyanchenko (13-2, 10 KOs), perhaps confronting the gravity of the wound and sensing time was short, burst from his corner to start the third and immediately shifted the tenor with aggressive volume punching, rushing pell-mell into the pocket and letting his hands go with shots from a variety of angles. Having suffered his lone professional defeat when he fought for the same belt against Daniel Jacobs last November, Derevyanchenko, who featured alongside Vasyl Lomachenko and Oleksandr Usyk on Ukraine\u2019s 2012 Olympic team, appeared hell-bent on not letting his second title shot go to waste. Golovkin was able to catch the swarming Derevyanchenko time and again with chopping shots on the way in, but Brooklyn-based Ukrainian was getting the better of the exchanges in the fourth. Both had their moments in the fifth but it was Derevyanchenko who took command late in the frame, caving in Golovkin\u2019s rib cage with a devastating body shot that left the Kazakh breathless. (That referee Harvey Dock intervened for no discernible reason with Golovkin clearly hurt left the Derevyanchenko camp understandably furious.) The bloodied Derevyanchenko continued to pour on the punishment with further dedicated body work in the sixth and by then was outboxing Golovkin, who was taking heavy breaths through his mouth and appearing to flag. Every time Golovkin was able to find purchase with a hook or an uppercut, Derevyanchenko was there to respond with flurries of punches to the head and body, never appearing to slow down. The back-and-forth exchanges pressed on into the seventh as both made their stands in the center of the ring, Golovkin doing his best work intercepting Derevyanchenko on his headlong forays. Golovkin came on strong in the eighth, bouncing a series of punches off Derevyanchenko\u2019s head as the crowd buzzed in anticipation for the finish. But he mysteriously let his foot off the gas and his opponent off the hook, allowing Derevyanchenko to resume scoring with angles and activity. The fighters continued to trade hellfire into the championship rounds as Derevyanchenko threw with abandon to the head and body as Golovkin held his ground. But Golovkin overcame his obvious fatigue and showed a remarkable finishing kick in the 12th, snapping his opponent\u2019s head back with clean and accurate punches to win the final frame on all three judges\u2019 cards and seal the decision, re-capturing the IBF title he won from David Lemieux in a October 2015 unification fight before he was stripped of it last year for not fighting Derevyanchenko when he was the organization\u2019s mandatory challenger. \u201cRight now it\u2019s bad day for me, [but] it\u2019s a huge day for Sergiy, his team,\u201d said Golovkin, who landed 242 of 720 punches (34%) compared to 230 of 738 for Derevyanchenko (31%). \u201cRight now I know what I need exactly. I lost a little bit of focus. Sergiy was ready. I really respect him. He showed me such a big heart. I told him, \u2018Sergiy, this is best fight for me.\u2019 I just respect his team.\u201d Both men were taken to the hospital immediately afterward for precautionary measures. Never before Saturday night, not even in two signature encounters with \u00c1lvarez that many believe Golovkin won but which officially went down as a split draw and a majority-decision loss, was the Kazakh puncher made to look more vulnerable. It may indeed be down to age. After scoring knockouts of 23 consecutive opponents during a decade-long rise to the top of the sport, he\u2019s been extended the distance in four of his last six outings. It\u2019s been nearly four years since he stopped a world class middleweight.

Sergiy, a lot of guys. Everything is ready. Just call Canelo. If he says yes, let\u2019s do it.\u201d",

Two-way action in the center of the ring and both make their stands. This was Golovkin\u2019s best round in some time: he\u2019s landing more and he appears to have got his second wind. Derevyanchenko still bleeding badly from this cut and you have to wonder if it will go to the cards sooner than later.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for tonight. Here\u2019s a look at the report from ringside. What a fight. Here\u2019s a look at the three judges\u2019 scorecards. The ringside judges have all scored it for Gennady Golovkin: Frank Lombardi had it 114-113, while Eric Marlinski and Kevin Morgan both scoring it 115-112 (as did the Guardian). Round 12 Very nice work from Golovkin with clean accurate punches to the head and body, but every time he\u2019s able to land in combination Derevyanchenko is so quick in response. These are hard rounds. Golovkin snaps Derevyanchenko\u2019s neck back with a left jab and now he\u2019s bullying his opponent in the center of the ring, stepping forward to quell his combinations. Golovkin doing just enough to win the round, but the scores could be all over the place. Simply gripping, really. The fight of the year. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: GGG 10-9 Derevyanchenko (GGG 115-112 Derevyanchenko) Round 11 A bloodied Derevyanchenko is barreling inside throwing punches but Golovkin is fighting off the back foot, trying to catch him with short chopping punches on the way in. Easier said than done. Derevyanchenko connects with a big hook on Golovkin, but Golovkin is scoring with the jab and doing enough in my view to edge the round. Derevyanchenko landing the showier shots but Golovkin, though he\u2019s looking his age tonight, is very much in it with a round to go. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: GGG 10-9 Derevyanchenko (GGG 105-103 Derevyanchenko) Round 10 Derevyanchenko comes out cracking in the 10th, landing a flurry of shots to the head and body while coming forward. Golovkin lands a combination upstairs and Derevyanchenko responds immediately. It all just keeps coming back. The crowd tries to urge Golovkin on with chants of \u201cTriple G! Triple G!\u201d Derevyanchenko is coming forward landing blow after blow to the head and body, but Golovkin stays in and holds his ground. Extraordinary and gruesome two-way action as the fighters trade hellfire in the center of the ring. Genuinely breathtaking. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: GGG 9-10 Derevyanchenko (GGG 95-94 Derevyanchenko) Round 9 A heat-seeking uppercut by Golovkin lands to open the ninth, but Derevyanchenko takes it well. Now the bloodied Derevyanchenko is opening up and throwing punches as Golovkin moves back in full retreat. He\u2019s outthrowing and outlanding Golovkin in this round, who appears to be fading. A big round for Derevyanchenko. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: GGG 9-10 Derevyanchenko (GGG 86-84 Derevyanchenko) Round 8 A good, measured start for Derevyanchenko, who\u2019s scoring with angles and activity as Golovkin starts slow. Then Golovkin bounces a series off hard punches off Derevyanchenko\u2019s head and the crowd buzzes, sensing a finish. But just as Derevyanchenko is spinning out of trouble, Golovkin takes his foot off the gas. Still, he\u2019s landing the more telling blows, but that was a razor-close round. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: GGG 10-9 Derevyanchenko (GGG 77-74 Derevyanchenko) Round 7 Derevyanchenko continues to stand his ground and throw crisp combinations to the head and body. A big right hand by Golovkin followed by a left to the body. Golovkin resumes cutting off the ring and Derevyanchenko escapes the corners with smart footwork and volume punching. This is a dogfight. Two-way action in the center of the ring and both make their stands. This was Golovkin\u2019s best round in some time: he\u2019s landing more and he appears to have got his second wind. Derevyanchenko still bleeding badly from this cut and you have to wonder if it will go to the cards sooner than later. And now the doctor is taking another hard look at the cut ... and sends him out for the eighth. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: GGG 10-9 Derevyanchenko (GGG 67-65 Derevyanchenko) Round 6 Derevyanchenko is beginning to pour on the punishment with these body shots. He\u2019s outboxing Golovkin. A big right over the top by Golovkin but Derevyanchenko cracks right back. Another big right by Golovkin, but every time he connects Derevyanchenko is there to throw back punches in bunches. Golovkin being pushed like we\u2019ve rarely seen. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: GGG 9-10 Derevyanchenko (GGG 57-56 Derevyanchenko) Round 5 The commission has ruled Golovkin\u2019s cut came from an accidental headbutt, which makes things awfully interesting as the fight would go to the scorecards if it were stopped due to the wound. Both guys having good moments in the fifth. GGG with an uppercut is a few nice hooks, but Derevyanchenko is busier. And Derevyanchenko hurts Golovkin with a devastating left to the body set up by a left-right combo upstairs. Golovkin is hurt! And the referee breaks it up for no reason. He\u2019s backed up the punch in the final seconds of the round so Derevyanchenko won\u2019t have time to follow up. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: GGG 9-10 Derevyanchenko (GGG 48-46 Derevyanchenko) Round 4 Golovkin lands a four-punch combination to the body, followed by a left upstairs as he continues to target the cut on Derevyanchenko\u2019s right eye. Derevyanchenko showing a great chin taking these punches. He\u2019s moving forward and pressing the action. Now he lands a left-right combo to the head that appeared to stop Golovkin in his tracks. But Golovkin lands a big right to the chin near the end of the frame. He\u2019s getting the better of the exchanges even as he takes a lot of punishment. The doctor at ringside takes a looong look at the cut on Derevyanchenko\u2019s eye before letting him go out for the fifth. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: GGG 10-9 Derevyanchenko (GGG 39-36 Derevyanchenko) Round 3 Derevyanchenko may sense time is running out with that cut because he comes out guns blazing in the third, bursting into the pocket and letting his hands go. A big exhange near the ropes that Derevyanchenko got the better of. He hurts Golovkin with a body shot, but Golovkin cracks right back with a left hook. Derevyanchenko did some great body work in that round and is throwing from an impressive variety of angles. He\u2019s certainly got Golovkin\u2019s attention. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: GGG 9-10 Derevyanchenko (GGG 29-27 Derevyanchenko) Round 2 Golovkin is snapping that left hand as he darts forward, but Derevyanchenko has been very aggressive and is throwing back and there appears to be a little marking under Golovkin\u2019s left eye. But Golovkin now backing up Derevyanchenko with the jab. GGG connects with a few left hooks. Derevyanchenko has a cut on his right eye and he\u2019s bleeding. Badly. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: GGG 10-9 Derevyanchenko (GGG 20-17 Derevyanchenko) Round 1 Big chants of \u201cTriple G! Triple G!\u201d from the crowd as the opening bell rings. Golovkin is working from the center of the ring and trying to establish the left jab as Derevyanchenko circles, pawing with his own jab. Derevyanchenko tries to come over the top with a right hand but it gets mostly leather. Golovkin is advancing and throwing the hook. He lands a big left hook and they\u2019re in a firefight. And down goes Derevyanchenko in the first on a left hand! He beats the count and is saying he was hit behind the head but it looked like a clean punch from ringside. Derevyanchenko is back on his feet and looks fine: he\u2019s moving forward and throwing more punches. Derevyanchenko makes his way to the ring to a medley of Ozzy\u2019s Crazy Train and Queen\u2019s We Will Rock You. He looks all business. Now it\u2019s Golovkin\u2019s turn as he makes his familiar entrance to Seven Nation Army. Ring announcer Michael Buffer takes handles the fighter interoductions and the two meet at the center of the ring for the final instructions from referee Harvey Dock. They return to their corners, the seconds are out and we\u2019ll pick it up with round-by-round updates from here! After a bit of a delay it\u2019s go time at Madison Square Garden. First it\u2019s the national anthem of Ukraine, then Kazakhstan and finally the United States. Big cheers for Golovkin as he\u2019s shown pacing in his dressing room during Menin Qazaqstanym. Brennyn Lark, currenly slaying as Eponine in the Broadway revival of Les Mis, delivers a rousing rendition of the Star-Spangled Banner. Even bigger cheers for Wesley Snipes as he\u2019s shown watching from ringside. And it\u2019s another delay with Michael Buffer standing in the center of the ring waiting for his cue ... but the fighters should be making their entrances any moment now. Junior middleweight pospect Israil Madrimov has just scored an emphatic fifth-round stoppage of Mexico\u2019s Alejando Barrera in the final undercard bout of the night. Madrimov, who improves to 4-0 with four knockouts (in addition to a 6-1 mark in his World Series of Boxing pro bouts), dropped Barrera in the opening seconds and dominated every minute before referee Benjy Esteves put a stop to it at the 2:36 mark of the fifth round. A bit of grumbling from the crowd for what some viewed as a premature stoppage but better too soon than too late. Hello and welcome to New York for tonight\u2019s middleweight title fight between Gennady Golovkin and Sergiy Derevyanchenko. We\u2019re ringside at the Garden for what promises to be an entertaining contest for the vacant IBF championship, even if it\u2019s not the long-awaited third chapter between Golovkin and Canelo \u00c1lvarez. As you may recall Golovkin suffered the lone blemishes on his pro ledger in a pair of close and controversial decisions opposite \u00c1lvarez, who\u2019s appeared in no hurry to tee it up a third time (instead scaling two weight classes to fight Sergey Kovalev). That\u2019s left Triple G to his own devices in the middleweight division he\u2019s dominated for so long, first with a stay-busy fight against the overmatched Steve Rolls in June and now tonight in a contest that could prove far more tricky. Derevyanchenko, who fought alongside Vasyl Lomachenko and Oleksandr Usyk on Ukraine\u2019s 2012 Olympic team, suffered his first and only professional loss in a title fight against Daniel Jacobs in November where he showed quite well. He\u2019s a game competitor and is well-positioned to spring an upset if Golovkin has lost anything off his fastball. Here\u2019s a look at how the fighters match up. Bryan will be here shortly.",

      "bodyText": "An Australian mining company was able to massively increase greenhouse gas emissions from two of its coalmines without penalty under a government policy that is meant to limit carbon pollution from large facilities. Centennial Coal was given permission on three occasions since 2016/17 to increase the greenhouse gas emissions from its Myuna colliery and Mandalong mines in New South Wales, according to data kept by the clean energy regulator. The increases were approved under the government\u2019s safeguard mechanism, which is supposed to ensure that emissions cuts paid for by taxpayers through its emissions reduction fund \u2013 now called the climate solutions fund \u2013 are not wiped out by rising emissions elsewhere. The safeguard mechanism sets pollution limits for large emitters such as mines and power plants. If a company exceeds this pollution baseline, it is required to purchase carbon credits to offset the increase, or pay a penalty. However, the government\u2019s policy allows companies to apply to increase their emissions baselines under certain conditions, thus allowing them to increase their overall total emissions. The Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF), which analysed emissions data for Centennial Coal published by the clean energy regulator, says flaws in the safeguard policy meant Centennial avoided having to buy about $8.3m in carbon offset credits, or pay an alternative penalty or implement stronger measures to cut their pollution. The ACF\u2019s analysis found that in 2017-18, Centennial\u2019s Myuna mine overshot its baseline of 402,028 tonnes by 65% \u2013 emitting a total of 664,956 tonnes \u2013 but it avoided penalty after having its baseline increased by the clean energy regulator. The mine\u2019s total emissions were more than double its reported emissions for the previous year. It was also granted two baseline increases for its Mandalong mine, one in 2016/17 and one in 2017/18, for more than 300,000 tonnes in excess emissions. In 2016/17, Centennial reported emissions of 1,560,761 tonnes of carbon at Mandalong, exceeding their reported baseline of 1,508,644 by 3.8%. In 2017/18 the mine was granted another baseline increase and reported total emissions of 1,866,089 tonnes. Gavan McFadzean, the ACF\u2019s climate and energy program manager, said the data highlighted the failure of the safeguards policy to effectively cap pollution from large emitters. \u201cThe fact that Centennial haven\u2019t done anything legally wrong is the problem,\u201d he said. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cThese are huge overshoots in emissions which are done really with impunity by the industrial and mining sectors in the full knowledge that the Morrison government will give them a free pass on whatever emissions of CO2 or methane they pump out into the atmosphere above their baseline.\u201d Australia\u2019s emissions have continued to rise, despite the Morrison government\u2019s claims it is taking action to address the climate crisis. The government\u2019s most recent quarterly greenhouse data showed fugitive emissions produced during the extraction of fossil fuels were up by 5.9%. Centennial is not the only company to have been granted baseline increases under the safeguard mechanism. Mining company Anglo American nearly doubled its greenhouse gas emissions in two years at its Moranbah North mine in central Queensland without penalty. McFadzean said the rise in pollution from companies such as Centennial and Anglo American was \u201cswamping\u201d the abatement purchased with public money through the climate solutions fund or the reductions coming from the Renewable Energy Target. \u201cAs a first step, the government must close the loopholes Centennial has exploited and tighten safeguard pollution caps over time, as recommended by the Climate Change Authority,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a bare minimum first step towards a comprehensive Australian climate change strategy that must bring down our pollution to zero by 2050 from all sectors of our economy including heavy industry, transport, energy and the land.\u201d Katie Brassil, Centennial\u2019s company spokesperson, said there were provisions in the legislation that allowed companies to increase their emissions in certain circumstances. \u201cBoth Mandalong and Myuna met these provisions,\u201d she said. Brassil said the company was able to seek a baseline increase at Mandalong due to changes in the natural deposit that meant there was an increase in emissions of fugitive gas. In the case of the Myuna mine, the company was able to increase its baseline because it could demonstrate that its production \u2013 and therefore total emissions \u2013 had risen but it had reduced the mine\u2019s emissions intensity per tonne of coal. \u201cCentennial is due to lodge its NGER\u2019s (National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting) return for 18/19 and we anticipate a reduction in Mandalong\u2019s emissions and again reduced emissions intensity for Myuna for the period,\u201d she said. The energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, said baselines \u201care intended to allow businesses to continue normal operations, support business growth and encourage lower emissions production\u201d. \u201cAs a result of changes made in March 2019, following a transition period, emissions limits will better reflect business as usual operations and will provide a more even and ongoing incentive for businesses to actively monitor and manage emissions,\u201d he said.",

Most of that will happen in my own electorate. \u201cWe actually want to become the renewable energy electorate. Western Downs shire is screaming at me to become the renewable energy shire of the country with solar and wind,\u201d the minister said. Asked whether he accepted that global warming meant some farms in Australia could become unviable, Littleproud said there was a market-led transition already under way. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen farmers change their practices from being broad-acre back into grazing as the climate\u2019s changed and as that\u2019s taken its toll on its landscape.\u201d He said farmers were already shifting with an eye to long-term viability and the question before government was how to assist people remaining on the land to adapt to changing conditions. Pressed on what the government\u2019s drought strategy was, because the bulk of a $7bn package the Morrison government points to regularly has not yet been spent, Littleproud said the government was in the process of refining the package with input from significant stakeholders, such as the National Farmers Federation. The minister said he wanted the NFF to provide its strategy so he could \u201cput that in front of cabinet\u201d along with a report from the Joint Agency Drought Taskforce, which was established within the prime minster\u2019s office and led by major general Stephen Day. He said the government was already acting on the recommendations from Day and would continue to work with state governments. Littleproud said what came next needed to extend outside his portfolio to a \u201cwhole of government\u201d response, including health, education and infrastructure. The minister said drought was complex, impacting farmers but also on whole communities. \u201cIt\u2019s not just farmers, it\u2019s the small business owners \u2013 building that infrastructure to build the resilience into the future.\u201d Labor last week asked the auditor general to investigate the government\u2019s claimed $7bn in drought assistance, saying the drought response to date had been \u201cad hoc, confusing and lacking in direction\u201d. The former Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce has declared the Coalition risks \u201cpolitical annihilation\u201d in the bush if the drought worsens and it does not start building dams \u2013 but there has also been controversy about the quality of Joyce\u2019s own input as special drought envoy. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Littleproud was also asked about recent comments from the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, who declared protesters who disrupt traffic should have their welfare payments cut and be subjected to mandatory jail sentences, part of a rhetoric offensive by conservative MPs against climate change protests. Littleproud responded in low-key fashion but broadly backed Dutton\u2019s arguments on Sunday morning. \u201cEveryone wants a cause these days. They become angry and impose their will on the Australian people. What this should be is about respect. \u201cI get everyone wants a cause. Everyone\u2019s got to be angry these days. But for Christ\u2019s sakes, respect your fellow Australians,\u201d the minister said. He said the Morrison government had taken action against animal activists \u201cthat impinged on the rights of farming families, and we passed legislation. \u201cBut a lot of this comes back to the states. We wouldn\u2019t have to do the heavy lifting if the states got in there and imposed higher penalties for these activists so that the magistrates had nowhere to go but to slip into them.\u201d",
