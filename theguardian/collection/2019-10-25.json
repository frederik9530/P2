He also pointed out that the reports were submitted to the New South Wales local government minister and uploaded on the city\u2019s website in November 2018, and metadata proves that at no time have these documents been changed or updated. He said the material provided by the minister on Friday did not explain where the document with the incorrect figures originated. With significant pressure building, Taylor issued a statement late on Friday afternoon saying he would be writing to Moore to offer his apologies for not \u201cclarifying\u201d numbers about travel at the council before writing to her in September. The minister said there was \u201cclear evidence\u201d on the council\u2019s own website \u201cthat there are different versions of the same report online right now\u201d. The material supplied by Taylor\u2019s office points to minor formatting differences between the Word and PDF versions of the annual report currently on the council\u2019s website. This is the evidence supplied by the office to argue that multiple versions of the same report have existed. The suggestion is that Taylor\u2019s office accessed a draft of the annual report. But Taylor has left it to the council to \u201cprove which documents have existed and may still currently exist\u201d. Taylor did not address the vast discrepancy between the figures for travel expenditure he accused the council of, and the actual figures displayed in the annual report on the council\u2019s website. Moore explained the slight variations by saying :\u201cThe City of Sydney does have two versions of our annual report online \u2013 it is uploaded as a PDF and a Word Document. The Word Document is available to assist with accessibility. \u201cWe present the material in two forms to aid accessibility, but the content is the same. Difference in formatting occur as a consequence of file export and operating system used to open the documents,\u201d she said. But she said the content in the material is \u201cidentical in both documents\u201d. \u201cThe figures used by the minister are not a small variation, they are grossly inaccurate.\u201d The statement from Taylor\u2019s office says the Department of Environment and Energy has confirmed that the minister\u2019s office accessed the City of Sydney website on 9 September, but there is no evidence supplied in Friday\u2019s statement that the report was downloaded from the council\u2019s website. The minister\u2019s attempted defence of his position came after the shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, formally asked the NSW police to investigate how his office came to use a doctored document to justify a political attack on the Sydney mayor\u2019s climate change stance. Dreyfus wrote to the NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, on Friday morning asking him to investigate the \u201chighly concerning\u201d revelations in the Guardian about the doctored document. \u201cAccording to that article, a report published in The Daily Telegraph on 30 September 2019 regarding travel expenditure by the City of Sydney Council was based on a forged version of the council\u2019s annual report,\u201d Dreyfus wrote. \u201cThat forgery, which dramatically overstated the Council\u2019s annual travel costs, was allegedly provided to the newspaper by the office of the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction, Mr Angus Taylor. \u201cThe false figures were also reportedly referred to in a letter sent by Mr Taylor to the lord mayor of Sydney, Ms Clover Moore.\u201d The Guardian revealed on Wednesday the false figures were used by Taylor\u2019s office to unleash a political attack on the Sydney lord mayor last month. Taylor claimed that Moore had increased carbon emissions by spending $15m on travel, a claim that was later backed up with a doctored council document provided to the Daily Telegraph, which the paper subsequently relied on to report the incorrect figure. Taylor\u2019s statement on Friday said his office, in preparing a reply to a letter from the City of Sydney lord mayor, accessed a report on the City of Sydney website on 9 September. \u201cThe details in that report were the basis of my letter to the lord mayor,\u201d Taylor\u2019s statement said. \u201cWhat is clear now, is that the numbers in that document were not correct. \u201cI reject absolutely the suggestion that I, or any members of my staff, altered the document in question; however, I will be writing to the lord mayor to offer my apologies for not clarifying those numbers with the City of Sydney before writing to her.\u201d Taylor said Labor had \u201cdramatically overreached by claiming the documents were forged or altered\u201d when there was \u201cabsolutely no basis for these assertions\u201d. The minister argued Labor had referred the case to police \u201cas a political tool\u201d, behaviour he characterised as \u201cdesperate and irresponsible\u201d.",

The department had also argued that the House panel did not have a sufficient explanation for how the material would help in the committee\u2019s investigations of Trump, and that impeachment is not a \u201cjudicial proceeding\u201d under the law, for which the information could be disclosed. The court ruling comes after reports that the DoJ has opened a criminal inquiry into the origins of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, a move that has raised concern that Trump is using the department to go after his political opponents. The news is the latest setback for Trump, who has come under attack on multiple fronts. Over the past month, a parade of witnesses have defied White House efforts to stonewall the House impeachment inquiry, delivering remarkable testimony in the expanding investigation involving Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure the Ukraine president for a political favor. Congressional impeachment investigators issued subpoenas Friday to three more Trump administration officials, demanding that they testify in the probe . The chairs of the three House committees leading the impeachment inquiry subpoenaed two officials of the White House Office of Management and Budget: acting director Russell Vought and Michael Duffey, who oversees national security programs. They also subpoenaed state department counselor T Ulrich Brechbuhl. Investigators asked all three earlier this month to testify, but none have appeared. The Trump administration has refused to make its officials available for depositions in the investigation and resisted supplying documents as well. But witnesses have been appearing anyway after they are issued subpoenas, including key witnesses Bill Taylor, the top US diplomat in Ukraine, and Marie Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine. \u201cThe committees therefore have no choice but to issue a subpoena compelling your mandatory appearance,\u201d the letters read. The impeachment inquiry, sparked by a whistleblower complaint, centers on Trump\u2019s efforts to extract a commitment from Ukraine\u2019s new president to investigate former vice-president and 2020 frontrunner Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Investigators want to know why nearly $400m in military aid to Ukraine was delayed, even though it was approved by Congress and signed into law by Trump. Others have testified that Trump was demanding investigations of Democrats in exchange for the aid and for an Oval Office meeting coveted by Ukraine\u2019s new president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. John Bolton, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, is also reportedly in talks to sit for a deposition with the House committees investigating impeachment. Bolton, who abruptly left the administration amid sharp foreign policy disagreements with the president and members of his cabinet, reportedly likened the effort to influence Ukraine in return for domestic political favors to a \u201cdrug deal\u201d. Trump announced Bolton\u2019s departure in a tweet, and the former official has since been publicly critical of the president\u2019s foreign policy.",

But if not, you are going to see another point of view, from a different vision.\u201d Victory at Anfield on Sunday, in Tottenham\u2019s first meeting with Liverpool since their defeat in the Champions League final, would improve the chances of a positive denouement. The form books might suggest that is an improbable outcome, and Spurs have not won in the past nine iterations of this fixture, but Pochettino believes his embattled squad remains a match for J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s side. \u201cOf course, because I love my players and believe we have an unbelievable squad with unbelievable players,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we are at our best we can beat any team.\u201d He offered a reminder that Liverpool have been free of the stadium-related upheaval, and associated strains, Spurs have faced over the past half-decade. \u201cOf course, expectations are so high, but when you analyse five years ago, both clubs have different objectives in that time,\u201d he said. \u201cFor them, they were focused on trying to build a team that can compete and win titles. For us, the same because we are so competitive, but the priority was in different areas. That makes it more difficult.\u201d",

It takes time to adjust to the Premier League, it doesn\u2019t matter how big the price tag is. \u201cWe have no doubt Joelinton\u2019s a very good player and we can improve him, he\u2019ll only get better. In Germany he played a lot in a front three, to the left, so we have that in our locker as well. \u201cI\u2019m a bit reluctant to change the system but Joelinton and Dwight playing together is something we\u2019re looking at because we need more goals. Gayle was an out-and-out No 9 for West Brom last season so we can look at the option of playing Joelinton on the left.\u201d Bruce trusts it will not be long before Carroll is also pressing for his first start. \u201cAndy overstretched trying to reach a ball and hurt his groin,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the good thing is that his ankle\u2019s OK; we hope he\u2019ll be fit for next week.\u201d",

It was touch and go there for a while - you can never be sure when somebody is managing Celtic - but when the Northern Irishman arrived in Leicester, it just felt like a very good fit. They are largely young, exciting players, devoid of many egos even though some of them remain Premier League winners, who are willing to get on board with Brendan-Ball and with a few wise, older heads keeping the dressing room in check, Leicester City are on the up again. </p> <p>In fact, they could leapfrog Manchester City to go second tonight, with a win over Southampton. Not bad for a team with a net spend of just \u00a315m in the summer. </p> <p>Southampton are without a league win since a 1-0 win over Sheffield United six weeks ago, and just outside the relegation zone. With a modest squad, Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl has done a reasonable job thus far, blooding academy youngsters and helping new recruits settle down: Moussa Djenepo looks particularly promising up front.</p> <p>This is exactly the sort of game that Leicester need to win if they want to break the top four. But under the evening lights, St Mary\u2019s always seems to have a little boost.</p> <p><strong>Kick off</strong>: 8pm BST. </p> <p>I\u2019ll have the teams with you shortly. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-25T18:34:20.685Z\">at 7.34pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl speaks! \u201cIt would be easy to say it\u2019s because of the red card but it\u2019s not the moment to discuss the result. I take 100% responsibility. It was a \u2018no\u2019 performance from us. I am proud of our fans who stayed and watch, they didn\u2019t deserve that. I want to say sorry I\u2019ve never had such an experience. It will not easy to recover from this. We have to stand up. I would agree with Nathan Redmond that it was an embarrassment. Tomorrow we will look at the match. He looks close to tears and deserves credit for not throwing his players under the bus. Very shocked to see that Donald Trump is tweeting about Southampton 0-9 Leicester. Brendan Rodgers speaks! It\u2019s a mentality that we\u2019re trying to impose. To finish with nine is a remarkable effort. We said to them at half-time: don\u2019t go soft. Keep your quality, keep your discipline. We had to do our job and punish Southampton. Its tough on Ralph. Harvey Barnes is going to be a big player for Leicester and for England. He doesn\u2019t have a arrogant personality but he\u2019s growing and changing all the time. One of his passes tonight was sublime. Kasper is really happy, the only other goalkeeper to have a \u2018niner\u2019 was his father! This is an education, some of our players like James Maddison and Ben Chilwell have a lovely arrogance. Southampton fans, you can relive tonight\u2019s game all over again. Look who is piping up. Looking forward to Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s post-match interview. Jamie Vardy speaks! \u201cWe know that when teams have 10 men that is can be difficult, but we caused them a few problems tonight.\u201d Um, yeah. Southampton drop into the bottom three, unsurprisingly because of goal difference. Leicester are second, on 20 points, which is a better total at this stage of the season then they had when they won the league. Nine goals. Two hat-tricks. One red card. This was the joint-biggest win in the Premier League (and a Schmeichel was present for both of them). The biggest ever top-flight away victory. Leicester played some sublime football tonight \u2013 Harvey Barnes, Jamie Vardy, Ayoze Perez and Ben Chilwell were outstanding, but we must emphasise just how bad Southampton were. Again, it is worth remembering that they were only one man down. Teams can usually make a fight of it with 10, but the performance from back to front was shambolic. James Ward-Prowse and a few others trudge around the pitch applauding the home supporters. I wonder if Southampton will give them their money back. Vardy sidefoots it into the corner! Leicester on cloud nine! 90+2 min: Leicester will have a chance to make it 9-0! Vardy will have a chance to score his own hat-trick! 90 min: Two minutes added on here. Blow up, ref. 88 min: \u201cI was struggling with whether or not to start Chilwell in my fantasy team - he hasn\u2019t done much of late - and I finally decided to go with him. Thank the lord,\u201d writes Ryan Barnes. I was going to mention Chilwell, who is a very good left back and has two assists and a goal tonight. His biggest strength, rather than being really quick or good in the air, or anything like that, is his intelligence. He\u2019s dependable at the back, makes sensible decisions and going forward combines really nicely with the left winger, which was Harvey Barnes tonight. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to lead England to World Cup glory any time soon, he\u2019s not world class, but not a million miles off. He\u2019s a bit like Leighton Baines in that regard. Vardy wins a free-kick on the edge of the box. It\u2019s 20 yards from goal, front-centre. Maddison is over the ball \u2026 which he curls beautifully over the wall into the corner! Textbook, that is. Gunn never stood a chance, it was hit with just pace and spin. 85 min: Somebody in the office has just admitted that they\u2019ve got Angus Gunn in their fantasy team. 84 min: If Leicester can cling onto this result, they will go above Manchester City into second place in the table. And with tonight\u2019s goals, they are now also second in the goals scored column, two ahead of Liverpool on 23. 82 min: \u201cIf two or more players bag hat-tricks, as could happen with this game, who gets the ball?\u201d asks Jason Ali. \u201cActually, I lived in Southampton for 12 years (1985-1997), so I tend to follow the team\u2019s result. This is not good.\u201d I\u2019m \u2026 not sure. I guess they just have one each. 80 min: The camera pans to Matt Le Tissier. He has seen better days. 79 min: Gray fires in a wonderful cross across the face of goal, but Stephens does well to hook it clear. 77 min: Southampton finally show a little bit of quality on the ball, their home fans jeering them ironically as they string maybe eight or nine passes together. 74 min: Golden chance for Perez to score his fourth! A corner is whipped in from the left, Perez kills it stone dead on the byline beyond the far post and rolls a cross/shot across the goal-line, the ball just missing the far post and the foot of Jonny Evans, who had a tap in, but didn\u2019t quite anticipate it correctly. And with that, Perez\u2019s work is done for the ebening. Three goals, his first in Leicester blue. He\u2019ll be replaced by Demarai Gray. 73 min: Worth remembering that Southampton\u2019s next two games are: Manchester City (away) in the league cup. Manchester City (away) in the league. Crumbs. 71 min: Leicester make their first change: Barnes off, Albrighton on. No Leicester player will want to come off. 69 min: Redmond forces Schmeichel into a very good save! The Southampton man darts down the left, skips inside Evans and curls one towards the top corner. Schmeichel sticks out a left hand and turns it over with his fingertips. Corner to Southampton, which comes to nothing. 64 min: This would be the joint-largest away win ever in the Premier League, behind Manchester United\u2019s 8-1 win over Nottingham Forest in 1999. The biggest ever Premier League win, remember is Manchester United 9-0 Ipswich. 62 min: \u201cI\u2019ve lost faith with Ralph,\u201d emails Andrew Read. \u201cThere are no words.\u201d I wonder, despite all the good work that Hasenh\u00fcttl has done since he arrived, if this one result could spell the end. In the wrong light, it could be seen that he has lost the dressing room, or that he is tactically inept. I don\u2019t actually believe that, but there will be lots of angry fans (and board members) to deal with in the coming days. 60 min: Leicester fans, with their scarfs in the air bearing the name of Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, sing a song dedicated to their late chairman. They are having the night of their lives. It\u2019s worth bearing in mind that Southampton are only one man down. They are playing like they have two legs. Leicester bomb forward and no Southampton players track their man. What that means is that Chilwell ends up on the byline, has time to get his head up, dinks a cross into the box, and Vardy has a free header, six yards out. No problem. Leicester are playing simple, patient football. It would be easy in this situation to bring out the tricks and flicks. But they simply work the ball around, waiting for the space to inevitably open up. When it does, Barnes drops an inch-perfect pass onto Perez\u2019s chest. The Spaniard controls it and lashes a volley past Gunn from close range. His third of the evening. 54 min: Fair play to Southampton fans, or what is left of them. They are belting out \u201cWhen the Saints go marching in,\u201d 52 min: Southampton have finally caved to having just two banks of four, with Nathan Redmond scurrying around up top. I forgot to mention there were a couple of subs made by Saints at the break. Ings and Vestergaard off, Stephens and Danso on. 50 min: \u201cThere\u2019s a fair chance Angus Gunn could well emulate his father, Bryan and set a top flight record unlikely to be broken,\u201d moots Phil Withall. \u201cA father and son that both concede seven goals in a Premier league match. Bryan having done so against Blackburn a long time ago \u2026\u201d Oh, you mean this game? As a Rovers fan, I don\u2019t mind giving the highlights a spin again, with the game also played in a torrential downpour. Watch out for a delicious dink/chip from a young Alan Shearer. Woof. 47 min: So nearly 6-0. Yoshida gets awfully lucky after he has his pocket picked by Vardy, with the England striker only firing his shot straight at Gunn. Not sure the half-time team talk has quite gone in for the Japanese. Peeeeeeeeeeeeep! And we\u2019re off again. It\u2019s time for 10-man Southampton to pull off the greatest comeback of all time. Stay tuned. \u201cRalph Hasenh\u00fcttl should go full John Sitton at half-time,\u201d writes Andrew Goudie. \u201cI can\u2019t see it, somehow.\u201d Na, me neither. This is the first time that Leicester have scored five league goals away from home in the league since 1984, when they beat Notts County 5-2 in the Old Division 1. \u201cThere are no easy games in the Premier League,\u201d smirks Matt Dony. \u201cUnless you\u2019re playing a dispirited 10 men in biblical rain. 0-8 prediction.\u201d Looking forward to the attendance announcement at half-time. Wonder if it is real time. I wonder what Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl is going to say to his team. Clinical from Vardy, who wasn\u2019t going to miss out on this goal-fest. Chilwell\u2019s cross is deflected over Vestergaard. Vardy takes it down with one touch, skins Yoshida with the other and lashes it past Gunn with a third from eight yards out. Eeeeeesh. 43 min: Barnes, now playing centrally, skips past two defenders to the byline where his shot is blocked. But the man is playing out of his rain-soaked skin. The Ol\u00e9s are coming out from the Leicester fans, by the way. 40 min: \u201cI\u2019d give credit to those fans that showed up for the start in that weather,\u201d emails Scott Wedel. \u201cThe fans that are leaving are showing more common sense than disloyalty to the home team.\u201d I wonder how many of them will stick around for the second half. This is a simple goal. Leicester work the ball from right to left, Chilwell crosses to the back post, Valery (now playing at left back in stead of Bertrand) completely switches off and lets the ball run, and Perez steals in to sidefoot the cross into the roof of Gunn\u2019s net. Absolutely miserable defending from Valery, who has had a shocking half. 34 min: \u201cI\u2019m obviously in a minority because I didn\u2019t think Bertrand\u2019s challenge was worth a red card,\u201d emails Graham Parley. \u201cNor did Andre Marriner at first viewing. So why didn\u2019t he review the tackle on the pitch-side TV rather than accept the judgement of Mike VAR Dean? Is it because no ref has used it all season?\u201d I think in that instance, it was because it was just so clear. Bertrand\u2019s studs clearly connected with Perez\u2019s half. With a bit more force, it could have done some serious damage. I also think that\u2019s why they showed it on the big screen at the stadium. Because they were in little doubt it was the right decision. A clear and obvious error that should be over-ruled. And guess what, it was Mike Dean, tonight\u2019 VAR, that did the deed. 32 min: Back come Leicester, and once more it is Barnes who is at the heart of the move. He seems to have an excellent understanding with Chilwell down this left flank. The left back overlaps Barnes and the pair play a one-two, with the winger so nearly squirming a shot under Gunn from close range. The Southampton keeper actually does well to stop it with his feet, and just claws the loose ball back from the goal-line when it runs free. 30 min: Chance for Southampton! This is an excellent move from the home side, which starts with Redmond bursting past Soyuncu on the right wing. The Englishmna switches the play wonderfully to Ings, who cuts the ball back to Romeu, who in turn feeds Redmond once more. Redmond is in, but a covering tackle from Evans forces him into an early shot, which is well saved by Schmeichel. 28 min: Barnes goes to ground on the edge of the box, claiming a foul from Romeu. Andre Marriner isn\u2019t having it, although the Englishman was probably impeded by Romeu\u2019s arm. Not enough to fall to the floor, mind. That said, I think Barnes is an exceptional player. Somebody that has played down the leagues with MK Dons, Barnsley and West Brom and knows the physical dirty side of the game. And he\u2019s so dynamic with the ball at his feet, can simply run round you with his pace. 25 min: The game has settled down, a little bit. Southampton have got into Leicester\u2019s half, and in fairness to Nathan Redmond, he actually looks quite bright, skipping past Ricardo Pereira on the left wing. 23 min: Good ebening. That\u2019s really one for the Arsenal fans \u2013 I don\u2019t particularly care \u2013 but I do think Brendan is a better manager. 21 min: Hasenh\u00fcttl, absolutely drenched on the sidelines, gestures for Ward-Prowse to come over and have a chat. The maverick 3-4-2-1 isn\u2019t working \u2026 20 min: Some home fans are leaving. This could be a cricket score \u2013 it\u2019s raining goals. This is just a simple one-two between Perez and Tielemans. Perez isn\u2019t tracked, and the former Newcastle man gets into the penalty area and fires a fierce, low strike in at the near post. Boos ring out around St Mary\u2019s. Absolutely sensational from Barnes, who nutmegs Valery on the left, storms past another covering defender and cuts the ball back. Valery actually recovers to get back, but only diverts it into Tielemans\u2019s feet, who fires past Gunn\u2019s right hand from around the penalty spot. Wow. 15 min: Perez seems to be OK, after that challenge from Bertrand. 12 min: This is surely not going to end well for Southampton, who now have a mountain to climb. \u201cThat was an exciting match while it lasted,\u201d emails Rob Coughlin. \u201cI feel for the Saints\u2019 supporters still sitting in that weather.\u201d What a double blow for Southampton! In the build-up to the goal, Bertrand caught Perez very high with his studs. After Leicester\u2019s celebrations subside, referee Andre Marriner goes to VAR and shows Bertrand a retrospective straight red! The incident is actually shown on the big screens for the fans, and nobody seems to have any complaints. Bertrand trudges off, Southampton are a goal and a man down. Chilwell miscues a cross right into the path of Barnes, who diverts a first-time shot towards goal. Gunn palms it out and Chilwell, who has the run on Valery at right back, is first to the ball. He simply sidefoots the ball into the net, with Gunn scrambling but unable to get to the rebound. 1-0! 9 min: Valery is very lucky boy! His backpass holds up in the wet grass, and Gunn only just gets to the ball before Barnes. 8 min: Harvey Barnes has the game\u2019s first shot, a low curling effort that ends up a few yards wide of the far post. It was never really troubling Gunn. 5 min: The quality is poor. The rain is heavy, as are most people\u2019s touches. 3 min: There is going to be some mistake - a comedy slip, perhaps - that leads to a goal tonight. 1min: It is \u2013 and I can\u2019t emphasise this enough \u2013 an absolutely disgusting evening in Southampton. The rain is pouring down at a fairly acute angle. And we\u2019re off. This is the first ever Premier League match which features two sons of former Premier League goalkeepers. The teams are out, Southampton in their red and white with a black trim. Leicester in their royal blue. Tonight will be the first fixture this season that we use the yellow winter ball. A fitting addition to what is a filthy evening. Get VERY excited about that. \u201cI agree that Brendan Rogers is a good manager,\u201d emails J.R. in Illinois. \u201cIf I was going to say what I like about him I would say he seems like one weird dude and that he was possibly the most Brent-ian of managers until recently when I believe Phil Neville may have taken that title from him.\u201d This is worth a read: Nick Ames\u2019s interview with Harley Willard, who was released by Southampton and is now playing in Iceland. It\u2019s absolutely tipping it down at St Mary\u2019s Stadium. Not sure they needed those sprinklers. Nobody has created more chances in the Premier League since the start of last season than James Maddison, who was extremely unlucky not to make his England debut over the international break due to illness, and even more unlucky to be pictured in a casino, shortly after he was released by Gareth Southgate for being ill. Still, Brendan has got his back. For Saints, this is what the bottom of the league currently looks like. But this has been a rotten run of fixtures for the south club coast. After defeats to Chelsea and Tottenham, Southampton did well to get a 1-1 draw at Wolves last time out. This match comes before two consecutive matches away at Manchester City (one league, one cup) and then games against Everton and Arsenal. If they can get through those and remain just clear of the drop zone, Hasenh\u00fcttl will be delighted. Nobody is expecting a top-half finish. Sunday will be the first anniversary of the death of Leicester\u2019s owner, and Southampton have chosen to honour Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha in their programme. Southampton: Gunn, Bednarek, Yoshida, Vestergaard, Valery, Romeu, Hojbjerg, Bertrand, Ward-Prowse, Redmond, Ings. Subs: McCarthy, Stephens, Long, Adams, Armstrong, Boufal, Danso. Leicester: Schmeichel, Ricardo Pereira, Evans, Soyuncu, Chilwell, Ndidi, Perez, Tielemans, Maddison, Barnes, Vardy. Subs: Justin, Morgan, Gray, Albrighton, Ward, Choudhury, Praet. Referee: Andre Marriner (West Midlands) Say what you like about Brendan Rodgers - and plenty have about envelope-gate and that portrait of himself hanging in the hallway of his house - but he is a very good football manager. It was touch and go there for a while - you can never be sure when somebody is managing Celtic - but when the Northern Irishman arrived in Leicester, it just felt like a very good fit. They are largely young, exciting players, devoid of many egos even though some of them remain Premier League winners, who are willing to get on board with Brendan-Ball and with a few wise, older heads keeping the dressing room in check, Leicester City are on the up again. In fact, they could leapfrog Manchester City to go second tonight, with a win over Southampton. Not bad for a team with a net spend of just \u00a315m in the summer. Southampton are without a league win since a 1-0 win over Sheffield United six weeks ago, and just outside the relegation zone. With a modest squad, Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl has done a reasonable job thus far, blooding academy youngsters and helping new recruits settle down: Moussa Djenepo looks particularly promising up front. This is exactly the sort of game that Leicester need to win if they want to break the top four. But under the evening lights, St Mary\u2019s always seems to have a little boost. Kick off: 8pm BST. I\u2019ll have the teams with you shortly.",

We let them outmuscle us a bit and we were not pleased. A lot of it is about attitude and we showed that, especially when Ross [Moriarty] received a yellow card shortly after coming on.

The quarter-final victory over France was notable for the result rather than the performance and a repeat against the Springboks will result in a flight home next Saturday rather than an appearance in the final. \u201cFrance were the better team on the day and the match was decided by a red card,\u201d said the Wales prop Tomas Francis whose battle up front against Tendai \u201cBeast\u201d Mtawarira will be one of the key individual contests. \u201cWe stuck in there and while we were not too happy with the performance, we are not dwelling on it but making sure we step up as a pack. \u201cWe were not good enough against France. We let them outmuscle us a bit and we were not pleased. A lot of it is about attitude and we showed that, especially when Ross [Moriarty] received a yellow card shortly after coming on. We stayed strong and we know the threats South Africa will pose.\u201d Wales made three changes from the team that defeated France through Moriarty\u2019s late try. Two were enforced with Josh Navidi\u2019s tournament ending that afternoon when he suffered a hamstring injury while Liam Williams damaged ankle ligaments in training this week after colliding with a teammate. Moriarty replaces Navidi while Leigh Halfpenny takes over from Williams at full-back. The Lions centre Jonathan Davies, who pulled out last week because he felt he had not fully recovered from the knee injury he sustained against Fiji in the third round, resumes his partnership with Hadleigh Parkes. \u201cWhen you have a player of Leigh\u2019s ability and achievement coming into the side it shows the strength in depth that we have built up,\u201d said Francis. \u201cThe same with Ross in the back row. South Africa beat us in the last World Cup with a try late on in the quarter-final and we have not forgotten that.\u201d Gatland predicted at the start of the year that Wales would win the Six Nations, which they did. He then said he believed they were good enough to lift the World Cup. His players are two matches away from proving him right. \u201cWinning the World Cup is one of the things you have to dream about and I am probably the greatest optimist in terms of believing something is possible and that there is a dream,\u201d said Gatland. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have that attitude and portray it, it will not happen. A big part of success is the belief and the desire to do something. That is what we will be building on in the next two days and I want to go back to New Zealand with my head held high. \u201cI thought we handled the end against France outstandingly after we had gone in front and you could see in the body language of their players that they did not expect to beat us. In the past, we might have panicked or got nervous but we were composed. That is something you cannot coach and which players have to learn themselves.\u201d Gatland said Wales were braced for the physical approach of South Africa who battered Japan into submission to reach the last four and predicted an ugly kick-fest. \u201cWe have played some big teams in this tournament already,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a World Cup semi-final and we have to bring our own physicality, something that is always important against South Africa. They have improved under Rassie Erasmus and gone back to their strengths, but I am looking forward to this game more than I was last week and I am more confident.\u201d",

Clark\u2019s 25 from 73 is 34.25%. Another season like this one and Hamilton will likely surpass him. Neither driver\u2019s figures were arrived at simply by being in the fastest car or through paucity of competition but with a skill often underestimated because it is hard to appreciate.</p> <p>Clark summed it up best. \u201cThe supreme attraction of motor racing to me is driving a car as near the physical limit as possible without stepping over it,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Clark, who won two titles in 1963 and 1965 before his death at Hockenheim in 1968, remains the most successful driver at the Mexican GP with three wins. The victories in 1963 and 1967 were impressive but the non-championship F1 race in 1962 stands out. Clark had taken over Trevor Taylor\u2019s car after his had been disqualified for receiving a push-start. He was 57 seconds down after the swap but flew after Jack Brabham and Bruce McLaren, passing both and sweeping to victory.</p> <p>This season at Hungary, Hamilton displayed similar dramatic skill, going wheel to wheel with Verstappen in a gripping fight. Unable to pass, Mercedes pitted Hamilton for new tyres to chase and attack. Twenty seconds back with 20 laps to go, the British driver gave a masterclass in inch-perfect control as he cut first through traffic, then the gap to Verstappen and ultimately took the lead and the win.</p> <p>In Mexico he emphasised just how important it was to try to maintain that step ahead. \u201cIt\u2019s the balance of everything you\u2019re doing outside of the sport, the obstacles you come across in the buildup to races, and just remaining consistent,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cPunching out these performances weekend-in, weekend-out, it\u2019s such a hard task,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople underestimate and undervalue how hard that is. People turn on the TV and see a few hours of our weekend but a massive amount of work goes on in the background.\u201d</p> <p>Whether he seals the title on Sunday or not, Clark would surely have recognised Hamilton\u2019s performances. \u201cThe man with natural ability uses finer limits than the man who has none,\u201d Clark wrote. \u201cIt is like a born artist being able to place paint on a canvas and make it a picture, whereas the majority of us would only make a mess.For I consider motor racing an art.\u201d</p> <p>Hamilton has been finessing his brush strokes for 13 seasons, a sixth title will place him among the masters.</p> <p>Hamilton was quickest in the first practice session in Mexico, just over a tenth clear of Ferrari\u2019s Charles Leclerc and Red Bull\u2019s Verstappen. However with the track rubbered-in for FP2 and teams running qualifying simulations Ferrari and Red Bull, as expected, had a distinct advantage. Sebastian Vettel topped the timesheets for the Scuderia a tenth up on Verstappen. Leclerc was in third but Bottas and Hamilton were in fourth and fifth, over six-tenths behind.</p>",

Neither driver\u2019s figures were arrived at simply by being in the fastest car or through paucity of competition but with a skill often underestimated because it is hard to appreciate. Clark summed it up best. \u201cThe supreme attraction of motor racing to me is driving a car as near the physical limit as possible without stepping over it,\u201d he said. Clark, who won two titles in 1963 and 1965 before his death at Hockenheim in 1968, remains the most successful driver at the Mexican GP with three wins. The victories in 1963 and 1967 were impressive but the non-championship F1 race in 1962 stands out. Clark had taken over Trevor Taylor\u2019s car after his had been disqualified for receiving a push-start. He was 57 seconds down after the swap but flew after Jack Brabham and Bruce McLaren, passing both and sweeping to victory. This season at Hungary, Hamilton displayed similar dramatic skill, going wheel to wheel with Verstappen in a gripping fight. Unable to pass, Mercedes pitted Hamilton for new tyres to chase and attack. Twenty seconds back with 20 laps to go, the British driver gave a masterclass in inch-perfect control as he cut first through traffic, then the gap to Verstappen and ultimately took the lead and the win. In Mexico he emphasised just how important it was to try to maintain that step ahead. \u201cIt\u2019s the balance of everything you\u2019re doing outside of the sport, the obstacles you come across in the buildup to races, and just remaining consistent,\u201d he said. \u201cPunching out these performances weekend-in, weekend-out, it\u2019s such a hard task,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople underestimate and undervalue how hard that is. People turn on the TV and see a few hours of our weekend but a massive amount of work goes on in the background.\u201d Whether he seals the title on Sunday or not, Clark would surely have recognised Hamilton\u2019s performances. \u201cThe man with natural ability uses finer limits than the man who has none,\u201d Clark wrote. \u201cIt is like a born artist being able to place paint on a canvas and make it a picture, whereas the majority of us would only make a mess.For I consider motor racing an art.\u201d Hamilton has been finessing his brush strokes for 13 seasons, a sixth title will place him among the masters. Hamilton was quickest in the first practice session in Mexico, just over a tenth clear of Ferrari\u2019s Charles Leclerc and Red Bull\u2019s Verstappen. However with the track rubbered-in for FP2 and teams running qualifying simulations Ferrari and Red Bull, as expected, had a distinct advantage. Sebastian Vettel topped the timesheets for the Scuderia a tenth up on Verstappen. Leclerc was in third but Bottas and Hamilton were in fourth and fifth, over six-tenths behind.",

Two minutes later, Gunn was fishing the ball out of his net again, with Vardy the culprit. The away end craved eight but got nine, by which point Southampton were broken.",

For years, the publication used a \u201cblack crime\u201d tag on articles and promoted anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant views. \u201cWe\u2019re the platform for the alt-right,\u201d Bannon told a reporter in 2016. In 2017, BuzzFeed News reported on emails and documents showing how the former Breitbart tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos had worked directly with a white nationalist and a neo-Nazi to write and edit an article defining the \u201calt-right\u201d movement and advancing its ideas. Facebook has long faced scrutiny for its reticence to police white nationalism and far-right hate on its platform. In July 2017, the Guardian provided Facebook with a list of 175 pages and groups run by hate groups, as designated by the Southern Poverty Law Center, including neo-Nazi and white nationalist groups. The company removed just nine of them. Following the deadly \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville in August 2017 \u2013 which was organized in part on a Facebook event page \u2013 the company cracked down on some white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups. Enforcement was spotty, however, and a year after Charlottesville, several groups and individuals involved in Charlottesville were back on Facebook. It was not until March 2019 that the company decided that its policy against hate should include white nationalism, an ideology that promotes the exclusion and expulsion of non-white people from certain nations. Facebook declined to provide a full list of the participating publications or offer further comment. Asked about the inclusion of Breitbart News at a launch event for Facebook News in New York, Zuckerberg declined to comment on \u201cany specific firm\u201d but added, \u201cI do think that part of having this be a trusted source is that it needs to have a diversity of \u2026 views in there. I think you want to have content that kind of represents different perspectives, but also in a way that complies with the standards that we have.\u201d The Facebook CEO faced harsh questioning from lawmakers this week, when he testified at a hearing of the US House of Representatives financial services committee. Though the hearing was putatively about Facebook\u2019s plans to launch a cryptocurrency, several representatives pressed Zuckerberg on his company\u2019s poor track record on complying with US civil rights laws, as well as policing hate speech. During an exchange about the company\u2019s decision to allow politicians to promote misinformation in paid advertising, the Democratic representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez pressed Zuckerberg on the inclusion of the Daily Caller, which she called \u201ca publication with well-documented ties to white supremacists\u201d, in the company\u2019s third-party factchecker program. In 2018, the Atlantic revealed that a former deputy editor of the Daily Caller also wrote under a pseudonym for a white supremacist publication. The publisher of the Daily Caller, Neil Patel, rejected Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s \u201cspurious allegations\u201d in a statement, saying: \u201cAny allegation that our company is in league with white supremacist types is offensive. We have denounced white supremacy in the past and are happy do so again [sic].\u201d",

We have an insatiable appetite, apparently, and each year we must feed the beast. The food becomes less practical while the contestants operate in more adverse conditions until we reach our final goal: an amateur chef making a beef wellington while crawling through no-man\u2019s-land under direct enemy fire.</p> <p>The king of kings is Ten\u2019s MasterChef, which is being reheated following <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/radio/programs/am/network-ten-loses-masterchef-judges-over-contract-dispute/11340792\">the loss of its judges between seasons</a>. This promises to be the most exciting year in a while, as the contestants battle against one another and the new judging team desperately tries to resist the urge to underpay them.</p> <p>In response, Seven have reunited the former MasterChef judges still allowed on television, Matt Preston and Gary Mehigan, and teamed them up with Manu, who, if I understand correctly, is legally obligated to be on every Seven show. Good luck in Summer Bay, Manu! Their new show \u2013 entitled Plate of Origin \u2013 is the kind of pitch you come up with when you think of the pun-title first and the show second. In it, cuisines from around the world are pitted against one another, combining Australia\u2019s two loves: food and judging other cultures. Personally, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to have a show like this and not include George Calombaris. That is not an appropriate punishment. He should be allowed to work on the show; he just shouldn\u2019t be paid for it.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s Seven\u2019s second reheated offering, My Kitchen Rules: a show that still exists apparently. This year, MKR has been given perhaps the most interesting twist of any of the rehashed reality offerings, with a live-in element to stop contestants from fleeing in the night. Watch as contestants are forced to bunk in with Pete Evans and a series of sharp objects, and somehow manage to resist temptation.</p> <p>Big Brother also returns, now on Seven and titled Big Brother: Revolution. The series began in 2001 and asked us to envision a world where everyone was constantly being filmed. Now in 2019, we\u2019re doing it again but without the excitement or cultural relevance. Details are scarce but judging by the title, my hope is that they\u2019ll lock 10 Australians away and convince them there has been a proletarian uprising.</p> <p>The Block for Nine and House Rules for Seven continue to go head-to-head in the beloved genre of competitive gentrification. Plus the surprise hit of 2019, The Masked Singer, will be back for Ten. The second season will be harder than ever for audiences to guess, considering they\u2019ve already gone through eight celebrities and Australia frankly does not have even that many.</p> <p>The Voice is also returning for Nine with the exceeding rare twist of keeping their judges and their format entirely the same. Will a spinning chair still be able to capture our attention when we have sighted a better world of celebrities being enveloped by Muppets? Only time will tell. Australia\u2019s Got Talent is back with a champions-against-champions format, a tacit admission that Australia has no longer got talent. And Dancing with the Stars is set to once again trot out its semi-ironic title and twirl into Australian\u2019s hearts. Still not interested? What if we got the stars almost naked? Is that enough for you, you sick freak? If so, welcome to The All New Monty: Guys and Gals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SevenNetwork/status/1186906821354590209\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ToddMcKenney?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@ToddMcKenney</a> announces The All New Monty: Guys &amp; Gals in 2020.

Perennial favourites remain Nine\u2019s Married at First Sight, a show in which misogynists slowly destroy their reputation in public; Ten\u2019s The Bachelor and Bachelorette, of course; and the return of Farmer Wants A Wife for Seven. There\u2019s something very funny about the idea of a television producer examining the horrors climate change is inflicting on farmers and livestock, and deciding: \u201cWe have to do something\u2026 We have to get these farmers a root.\u201d</p> <p>And to wrap up the year, there\u2019s the proper off-the-wall bonkers collection of reality shows.</p> <p>The competitive jungle gym showdown that is Australian Ninja Warrior returns again, as does Australian Survivor and I\u2019m A Celebrity \u2013 the latter two once again flirting with the notion of killing off a few not-quite-celebs and really jeopardising The Masked Singer season three.</p> <p>Joining this cabal is Rebel Wilson\u2019s Pooch Perfect for Seven (another stellar case of name first, show second), and Mega Mini Golf, which promises all the fun of watching someone else play mini golf. Along with the return of Lego Masters, these form the \u201csure, I guess that\u2019s a show\u201d triumvirate: a testament to how television executives, like the rest of us, have no real idea what they\u2019re doing and are just guessing at all times.</p>",

Big Brother also returns, now on Seven and titled Big Brother: Revolution. The series began in 2001 and asked us to envision a world where everyone was constantly being filmed. Now in 2019, we\u2019re doing it again but without the excitement or cultural relevance. Details are scarce but judging by the title, my hope is that they\u2019ll lock 10 Australians away and convince them there has been a proletarian uprising. The Block for Nine and House Rules for Seven continue to go head-to-head in the beloved genre of competitive gentrification. Plus the surprise hit of 2019, The Masked Singer, will be back for Ten. The second season will be harder than ever for audiences to guess, considering they\u2019ve already gone through eight celebrities and Australia frankly does not have even that many. The Voice is also returning for Nine with the exceeding rare twist of keeping their judges and their format entirely the same. Will a spinning chair still be able to capture our attention when we have sighted a better world of celebrities being enveloped by Muppets? Only time will tell. Australia\u2019s Got Talent is back with a champions-against-champions format, a tacit admission that Australia has no longer got talent. And Dancing with the Stars is set to once again trot out its semi-ironic title and twirl into Australian\u2019s hearts. Still not interested? What if we got the stars almost naked? Is that enough for you, you sick freak? If so, welcome to The All New Monty: Guys and Gals. This brings us neatly into the \u201chorny reality\u201d tier. Perennial favourites remain Nine\u2019s Married at First Sight, a show in which misogynists slowly destroy their reputation in public; Ten\u2019s The Bachelor and Bachelorette, of course; and the return of Farmer Wants A Wife for Seven. There\u2019s something very funny about the idea of a television producer examining the horrors climate change is inflicting on farmers and livestock, and deciding: \u201cWe have to do something\u2026 We have to get these farmers a root.\u201d And to wrap up the year, there\u2019s the proper off-the-wall bonkers collection of reality shows. The competitive jungle gym showdown that is Australian Ninja Warrior returns again, as does Australian Survivor and I\u2019m A Celebrity \u2013 the latter two once again flirting with the notion of killing off a few not-quite-celebs and really jeopardising The Masked Singer season three. Joining this cabal is Rebel Wilson\u2019s Pooch Perfect for Seven (another stellar case of name first, show second), and Mega Mini Golf, which promises all the fun of watching someone else play mini golf. Along with the return of Lego Masters, these form the \u201csure, I guess that\u2019s a show\u201d triumvirate: a testament to how television executives, like the rest of us, have no real idea what they\u2019re doing and are just guessing at all times.",

Sarah was madly in love with Mark, who was her first real boyfriend, although she had \u201ca bit of a meltdown\u201d at one point. She\u2019d been brought up in a strict Christian family where sex before marriage, especially with someone who wasn\u2019t religious, was frowned upon. </p> <p>They split up for about a fortnight but were soon reunited.

I never felt that.\u201d It still holds true, she says. \u201cAll the usual stuff like leaving the loo seat up or the wet towels on the floor \u2026 but he\u2019s got way more stuff that I love about him.\u201d</p> <p>For Mark, it was simpler. \u201cI never ever thought \u2018what is love\u2019, \u2018am I in love?\u2019 I think it was about enjoying being together ... and with Sarah we were always doing things,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was always about us and our friendship and enjoying life.\u201d</p> <p>But it wasn\u2019t an easy start. The two are from very different backgrounds: Mark was a kid from a council estate with working-class parents and Sarah\u2019s middle-class Christian parents did not approve. When Mark asked her parents if he could marry Sarah, they resisted. What should have been a happy day didn\u2019t end well, but it did help Sarah make a decision.<em>\u201c</em>I had this epiphany that if I wanted to be happy with Mark \u2013 and Mark was who I wanted to be with \u2013 we\u2019d just have to forge our own path.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"313085eaaacb28ee19f9a53bed0de5ac81992f57\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/313085eaaacb28ee19f9a53bed0de5ac81992f57/0_0_3264_1832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The couple on holiday in 2009.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"561\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The couple on holiday in 2009.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark and Sarah Stewart</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They moved in together instead, and a few years later got married at a local registry office. Although both sets of parents came along, it was only when the couple\u2019s first child arrived that the family reconciled.</p> <p>In 1996, the couple moved to New Zealand with their two children, then aged six and eight. It was a \u201chuge\u201d decision, which they didn\u2019t realise until they arrived. They settled in Gisborne, an isolated town in the North Island, planning to stay for a few years and see how things worked out. Then the New Zealand currency crashed and their savings halved, meaning a return to the UK was unlikely.</p> <p>Things became more difficult when they decided to move to Dunedin. While they tried to sell their Gisborne home, they rented in Dunedin. Mark was at his wits\u2019 end. \u201cIt was like we were burning money in the garden and in the end we were living off the credit card. The credit card was getting more and more near to maxing out and we just didn\u2019t have anything,\u201d he says. </p> <p>\u201cAt one time I remember that I said I\u2019m going to move back to England. If I had enough money on the credit card, I would\u2019ve gone back to England but we didn\u2019t. It was like, what do we do? I could\u2019ve asked my mother for money but they couldn\u2019t have afforded it, it would\u2019ve been deserting Sarah and the kids. [It was] like you\u2019re on the roof of your house and your house is on fire, what do you do?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The shared values around working hard, being authentic, being true to ourselves ... those things were core to us.</p> <footer> <cite>Sarah Stewart</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He ended up juggling three part-time jobs to make ends meet. Eventually they sold their Gisborne home and completed their move to Dunedin. They stuck together during those tough times, says Sarah, sometimes for quite practical reasons. </p> <p>\u201cPeople say to us \u2018how do you stay together?\u2019 and I make a joke of it and say we can\u2019t afford to get divorced.

      "bodyText": "Names: Sarah and Mark Stewart Years together: 39 Occupations: Public servants The Good, the Bad and the Ugly isn\u2019t usually considered a romantic film, but for Sarah and husband Mark Stewart, it worked a treat. It\u2019s also a handy analogy for the many ups and downs they\u2019ve faced in their almost 40 years together, and yet they\u2019re still going strong. The British-born couple met in Salisbury when they were both 18 years old and Sarah was a student nurse. One night, she and her friends met a group of \u201clikely lads\u201d, including Mark, at the pub. \u201cI fancied him like mad, he was yummy,\u201d she says. Mark was out with the boys, \u201csmashed\u201d and somewhat oblivious, but Sarah was smitten. Every night for the next fortnight she dragged her friends around all the local pubs in the hope of running into Mark. One night she bumped into him. He was out with friends and they all ended up back at someone\u2019s house to watch that fateful Clint Eastwood western. \u201cAnd he gave me this really lovely kiss and that was it, I had my hooks into him,\u201d she says today with a laugh. The two were soon spending much of their time together. Sarah was madly in love with Mark, who was her first real boyfriend, although she had \u201ca bit of a meltdown\u201d at one point. She\u2019d been brought up in a strict Christian family where sex before marriage, especially with someone who wasn\u2019t religious, was frowned upon. They split up for about a fortnight but were soon reunited. Sarah remembers wondering whether she could live with him and any of his annoying habits. \u201cIt comes back to that [question] if I feel like I need to change him, then he\u2019s not the right one for me. I never felt that.\u201d It still holds true, she says. \u201cAll the usual stuff like leaving the loo seat up or the wet towels on the floor \u2026 but he\u2019s got way more stuff that I love about him.\u201d For Mark, it was simpler. \u201cI never ever thought \u2018what is love\u2019, \u2018am I in love?\u2019 I think it was about enjoying being together ... and with Sarah we were always doing things,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was always about us and our friendship and enjoying life.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t an easy start. The two are from very different backgrounds: Mark was a kid from a council estate with working-class parents and Sarah\u2019s middle-class Christian parents did not approve. When Mark asked her parents if he could marry Sarah, they resisted. What should have been a happy day didn\u2019t end well, but it did help Sarah make a decision.\u201cI had this epiphany that if I wanted to be happy with Mark \u2013 and Mark was who I wanted to be with \u2013 we\u2019d just have to forge our own path.\u201d They moved in together instead, and a few years later got married at a local registry office. Although both sets of parents came along, it was only when the couple\u2019s first child arrived that the family reconciled. In 1996, the couple moved to New Zealand with their two children, then aged six and eight. It was a \u201chuge\u201d decision, which they didn\u2019t realise until they arrived. They settled in Gisborne, an isolated town in the North Island, planning to stay for a few years and see how things worked out. Then the New Zealand currency crashed and their savings halved, meaning a return to the UK was unlikely. Things became more difficult when they decided to move to Dunedin. While they tried to sell their Gisborne home, they rented in Dunedin. Mark was at his wits\u2019 end. \u201cIt was like we were burning money in the garden and in the end we were living off the credit card. The credit card was getting more and more near to maxing out and we just didn\u2019t have anything,\u201d he says. \u201cAt one time I remember that I said I\u2019m going to move back to England. If I had enough money on the credit card, I would\u2019ve gone back to England but we didn\u2019t. It was like, what do we do? I could\u2019ve asked my mother for money but they couldn\u2019t have afforded it, it would\u2019ve been deserting Sarah and the kids. [It was] like you\u2019re on the roof of your house and your house is on fire, what do you do?\u201d He ended up juggling three part-time jobs to make ends meet. Eventually they sold their Gisborne home and completed their move to Dunedin. They stuck together during those tough times, says Sarah, sometimes for quite practical reasons. \u201cPeople say to us \u2018how do you stay together?\u2019 and I make a joke of it and say we can\u2019t afford to get divorced. When you sit down and look at finances \u2013 this isn\u2019t very romantic \u2013 but the reality is we couldn\u2019t afford it,\u201d she says. \u201cFrom a pragmatic point of view, we\u2019ve got to make it work.\u201d Family stability was also important to them. \u201cOne of the things that kept us together was providing a home for the children,\u201d says Sarah of the times in Dunedin. \u201cOne of the things I\u2019ve been very conscious of, all their friends were split up and their families were split up.

      "bodyText": "I pointed out last weekend Scott Morrison spends a large proportion of his time doing two things: talking about how bad Labor is in the hope voters will conclude they made the correct choice in returning him to government in May, and trying to be relatable to people who don\u2019t like politics and tune in as little as they have to. As a subset of these two objectives, Morrison speaks constantly about how stable and dependable his government is (as opposed to his political opponents, who are cast as reckless and engaged in headless chookery). In order to nail the requisite talking point, backbenchers rise loyally, one after the other, every question time, and ask the dear leader and his cabinet colleagues to explain how calm and wise the government is. Morrison has these formulations read out each sitting day by willing automatons, who periodically inject a lilt or a Pinteresque pause into their questions, like they are at a Toastmasters session at the local Rotary club. Those of us forced to watch this pantomime daily do periodically worry this could be a plot to drive us all bonkers; to force the journalists of the Canberra press gallery to flee, screaming, from the building, leaving them to whatever they want to cook up. But in reality the government couldn\u2019t give a stuff about us, whether we persist or whether we flee \u2013 it is speaking over our heads, to the voters. By hammering these messages, Morrison wants one thought to penetrate the great national switch-off: he wants voters to trust him. He wants voters to believe he is a man of his word, that he means what he says, and follows through on commitments. It seems an audacious strategy for a leader in an age when people are inclined to think all politicians stink, but that\u2019s what Morrison wants. Trust. With that thought in mind, it was interesting this week to watch one small exchange in Senate estimates exposing a measurable gap between the prime minister\u2019s rhetoric and actions. Readers will remember Morrison took some heat at the Pacific Islands Forum earlier in the year when he presented as insufficiently empathetic about the threat the climate emergency posed to the region. There were some harsh words. But at the end of the day, despite all the thundering and virtue signalling on the greatness of coal, Australia signed on to a communique that was actually pretty forward leaning on climate change. As I noted at the time, despite all the arm twisting in Tuvalu, Morrison did, in the end, sign up to a statement that committed Australia to pursuing efforts to limit global warming to 1.5C, and to produce a 2050 strategy by 2020 \u2013 no small things. This 2050 strategy, the statement said, \u201cmay include commitments and strategies to achieve net zero carbon by 2050\u201d. Navigating that harmonious landing point with Pacific leaders was, presumably, an important gesture for an Australian prime minister fond of calling his counterparts in the region \u201cfamily\u201d. But Labor\u2019s Senate leader, Penny Wong, during this week\u2019s Senate estimates hearings, decided to do a little bit of due diligence about what Australia had actually signed up to at the Pacific Islands Forum, and whether we actually meant it. With foreign affairs department officials arrayed before her, Wong asked first whether or not Australia had sought any reservations or exceptions to the PIF communique (which just means did we opt out of any part of the statement). Kathy Klugman, the official responsible for Pacific strategy, said no exceptions had been sought. When it came to the PIF communique, Australia was all in. Having established that we were all in, Wong professed some curiosity that the Morrison government had signed a communique declaring that a \u201cclimate change crisis\u201d was facing Pacific Island nations, when the Coalition rejects that language at home as alarmism. Were we on board with that bit \u2013 the climate crisis? Klugman replied that Australia had signed the declaration and \u201cwe associate ourselves with all parts of it, including that part\u201d. Wong then asked whether the government agreed that emissions needed to be reduced to net zero by 2050 in order to achieve the goals articulated in the PIF declaration. Things then got a bit stickier. Clare Walsh, a deputy secretary of the department, joined the conversation. Walsh noted that achieving net zero emissions by 2050 was \u201can aspiration by some countries\u201d. But the Australian government had not signed on to that \u201cin terms of its domestic application\u201d, she said. Wong then translated. So we\u2019ve associated ourselves with that objective internationally in this communique, but would not take the requisite action domestically? Walsh ploughed on. She said the PIF declaration recognised the importance of that issue to the Pacific and recognised net zero by 2050 as a \u201ccommonly referenced target \u2013 but it isn\u2019t one that Australia has signed up to domestically, no\u201d. Wong then wondered why Australia had signed up to a document which said pursuing global efforts to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels was \u201ccritical to the security of our Blue Pacific\u201d when Australia\u2019s domestic emissions reduction targets \u2013 the ones we\u2019ve signed on to as part of the Paris agreement \u2013 were not consistent with achieving the 1.5C objective. Was the government planning to increase the level of ambition to square those circles, Wong wondered? \u201cThere is no change to the government\u2019s policy senator,\u201d noted the foreign minister, Marise Payne, who was at the table. Wong evidently thought she\u2019d reached the moment to deliver the moral of the story. \u201cSo we go along to the PIF and tell them we think 1.5C is important but we are not prepared to put targets on the table that are anywhere near consistent with it \u2013 just so we are clear about what we are doing,\u201d she said. Payne replied that Wong could \u201cput it in those terms\u201d but the government had been very clear it was persisting with the policies it took to the election. So, to cut a long story short, Morrison has signed a document with Pacific leaders, with the \u201cfamily\u201d, that suggests we are as one when it comes to managing the risks of climate change, yet in reality we have very different policies, goals and objectives. It pays to remember things like this when our prime minister asks you to trust him. Katharine Murphy is Guardian Australia\u2019s political editor",

This week, an inquiry established by the NSW police watchdog heard that much of the \u201chigh visibility\u201d policing at Splendour may have been illegal. On Monday the Law Enforcement and Conduct Commission opened its investigation into the allegedly illegal search of a 16-year-old girl at the festival.

The revelations come at a sensitive time for the NSW government and its police force. Earlier this year a coronial inquest heard evidence that in some cases a heavy police presence at music festivals may have contributed to drug-related deaths, including in the case of 19-year-old Alex Ross-King, who died after she took an unusually high amount of MDMA because she was afraid of being caught with the drugs by police. This month the coroner\u2019s draft recommendations were leaked to the conservative Sydney tabloid the Daily Telegraph. They revealed the deputy state coroner, Harriet Grahame, would urge the state government to allow pill testing at music festivals, scrap sniffer dogs and instruct police not to punish people caught with drugs for personal use. In September, the NSW police published a \u201cperson-search manual\u201d for the first time. The manual asserts that officers are entitled to instruct people to squat, lift their testicles or breasts, or part their buttock cheeks during a strip search. This week, some of Australia\u2019s largest music festivals, including Splendour in the Grass, threatened to leave the state over what the industry calls a \u201cpunitive\u201d safety regime floated by the government. \u201cUp until now the NSW police have been able to hide behind a wall of political support from both Labor and the Coalition,\u201d NSW Greens MP David Shoebridge told Guardian Australia. \u201cWell, we\u2019re now seeing behind that political wall because of the coroner and the Lecc\u2019s work. \u201cAnd what we are seeing is that how those policing practices work is deeply disturbing, with individuals being routinely humiliated without any justifiable law-and-order outcome. \u201cWhat we now know is that we have had a whole series of children unlawfully strip searched by police officers for no reason.\u201d In NSW, police are permitted to carry out field strip searches only if the urgency and seriousness of the situation requires it. In the case of minors, a parent, guardian or support person must be present during the search unless it\u2019s necessary for the safety of the person, or to prevent evidence being destroyed. The inquiry heard this week that some officers working at the festival did not know their obligation in relation to minors and, in the case of the 16-year-old, there was no justification for initiating the search. The two officers involved did not make contemporaneous notes before conducting the search, but entries in the NSW police database said after a drug-dog detection the girl had told officers she had been near other people smoking cannabis. On Wednesday, the officer charged with running the drug-dog operation at the festival was asked whether that justification would be sufficient to search a 16-year-old. \u201cNot based on what I have just read there,\u201d he said. \u201cYou must be disappointed to read that there, then, given that that is supposed to record a proper justification; correct?\u201d Dwyer asked. \u201cCorrect,\u201d he replied. The report, he said, was never checked by a more senior officer \u2013 usual practice \u2013 because officers had been allowed to \u201cself-verify\u201d reports made in the police online database. \u201cWe acknowledged that there was a flaw that was allowed to happen, and I totally take responsibility for that,\u201d the senior officer told the inquiry. The rules around what justifies a strip search in NSW have long been criticised by legal groups. In August, the Redfern Legal Centre released a report with the University of NSW which warned imprecise legal thresholds defining when an officer is able to conduct a strip search meant unlawful use of the practice is \u201cpotentially widespread\u201d. This week, the centre\u2019s police power\u2019s solicitor, Sam Lee, wrote to the Lecc reiterating those concerns, saying the personal search manual released in September \u201cfails to provide police with clear and rigorous guidance regarding the legal thresholds\u201d when conducting personal and strip searches. Adams seemed to echo those concerns this week, saying he believed police needed a \u201ccorporate position\u201d on when the use of strip searches was necessary. The Lecc also heard that in two cases the quantity of drugs initially recorded by the officer increased significantly in the fact sheet sent to the magistrate, from 0.4g and 1g to 3.18g. The increase \u2013 by 795% in one case and 318% in the other \u2013 was potentially significant. In NSW, the point at which a possession charge becomes a more serious traffickable offence is 3g.

They\u2019re not \u2018unchallengeable\u2019. And they\u2019re not specific to boys\u2019 schools, either. It can happen anywhere, but there is a higher propensity for it when you have boys en masse who are left unchecked.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hickey recalls looking at a study of an independent Catholic boys\u2019 school which embarked on proactive measures to address its hypermasculinity problem, including hiring more female senior professional staff, foregrounding the arts, changing the physical environment and valorising the rugby archetype less. It found that culture not only changed for the better, but even boys who had benefited from the previous macho culture also benefited from the culture change.</p> \n<h2><strong>What the research says</strong></h2> \n<p>When the Armidale School began to scope the move towards co-education, it conducted a literature review and found itself unable to conclude that either school structure was inherently superior.</p> \n<p>A <a href=\"https://rd.acer.org/article/single-sex-schooling-and-achievement-outcomes\">study by the Australian Council for Education Research</a> in 2017 found that, after accounting for socioeconomic status, students in single-sex schools did outperform their co-ed counterparts in reading and numeracy Naplan scores between grades 3 and 7, but added that as the difference in achievement did not grow over those years \u201cthere appears to be no value-add in numeracy achievement and even a decline in reading achievement over time in single-sex schools compared to co-educational schools\u201d even though single-sex schools continued to outperform co-ed generally.</p> \n<p>In 2014, the NSW Department of Education <a href=\"https://www.cese.nsw.gov.au/images/stories/PDF/VAPaper_v3-1Final.pdf\">published a report</a> which found that while evidence in the global debate about the merits of single-sex schooling was inconclusive, there were positive effects within the NSW state school system.

      "bodyText": "It was financial imperative that prompted the Armidale School to break with its more than 120-year tradition of teaching boys exclusively on its grounds in the New England tablelands of New South Wales. The school wanted to grow. When consulting parents and community, headmaster Murray Guest and the school insisted it would be introducing co-education without changing culture and tradition. But they were wrong: culture did change. \u201cThere is no doubt in my mind it has been a good change,\u201d Guest says. \u201cThe social environment in the school is a better one now than it was before.\u201d In 2016 he did not expect to see the strength of benefits of changing to co-ed as he has. \u201cThe interaction between boys and girls isolates some of the less desirable aspects of both,\u201d he says. \u201cSo the very macho is downplayed, while at the same time girls are encouraged to be interacting with boys and breaking out of the \u2018girls being girls\u2019 mould. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly a softening of culture and growing sophistication.\u201d Macho cultures within boys\u2019 schools have come under scrutiny this week, with video of boys from elite Melbourne Catholic boys school St Kevin\u2019s chorusing misogynistic chants on a tram, prompting widespread condemnation from the public and the school\u2019s headmaster, who said the misogynistic culture at the school was worse than he thought. It has sparked a revival of debate about whether such single-sex school environments breed hypermasculine behaviours, and raises the question: do the social effects of educating boys and girls together outweigh the widely touted academic gains of single-sex education? Dylan Laver graduated from high school two years ago, having attended Sydney Grammar boys school before finishing school at the co-ed Manly public high school. His elite boys\u2019 school did not have a substantial problem with macho or misogynistic culture, he says, but he suggests that isn\u2019t true of all such schools. \u201cThere\u2019s a stereotypical male type that certain schools look for when students are applying,\u201d he says. \u201cThey want students of their school to act and look a certain way, and they play a role \u2013 unintentionally \u2013 in developing a very masculine culture.\u201d \u201cThen again, in a co-ed school guys find their own groups anyway.

He called on Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, to \u201cman up\u201d and vote for one, claiming that parliament would only engage in \u201cpointless Brexitology\u201d if given the chance to debate his legislation without a hard deadline. Sajid Javid, the chancellor, claimed the government would simply lay motions \u201cagain and again\u201d until other parties agree to go to the polls.</p> <p>However, Corbyn made clear he would only vote for an election if Johnson made \u201cabsolutely clear\u201d to parliament on Monday that there would be no crash-out on WTO terms, because \u201chis deal includes the possibility of a no-deal exit\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6ef450b77e7b11690d441d8a9238aca46b5b1e5e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ef450b77e7b11690d441d8a9238aca46b5b1e5e/14_72_3912_2348/1000.jpg\" alt=\"BorisJohnson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">BorisJohnson insisted he would refuse to bring back his Brexit legislation unless MPs granted him a general election.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Grover/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Johnson is unlikely to remove the threat of a no-deal exit to Corbyn\u2019s satisfaction because the EU will not formally decide the length of the Brexit extension requested by the UK until early next week. During a meeting of EU diplomats, the French ambassador stood alone in arguing that it was not the right time to agree a three-month delay, in a move that will be welcomed in Downing Street.</p> <p>If the EU ultimately grants a three-month delay and Labour continues to refuse an election, Johnson might not be able to stop the withdrawal agreement being revived by backbenchers. The decision would rest with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2019/oct/21/bercow-refuses-second-brexit-deal-vote-video\">John Bercow, the Speaker,</a> who could allow it to be \u201cunpaused\u201d by MPs as one of his last acts after a decade in the chair.</p> <p>Labour MP Peter Kyle said he was in talks with ex-Tories about their next steps. Bringing the agreement back to parliament was \u201cone of the options on the shelf\u201d and \u201ccredible\u201d. Kyle said they had done all the preparatory work for this scenario in the summer and were ready to go with such a parliamentary move if needed, but wanted to see what the government and Corbyn did in the next few days.</p> <p>He said he did not believe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/24/boris-johnson-to-ask-mps-to-back-pre-christmas-election\">Johnson\u2019s threat that no Brexit legislation </a>would be brought back to the Commons between now and Christmas, so backbenchers might not need to try and bring back the bill themselves but could amend his deal.</p> <p>Support for a second referendum \u201cebbs and flows\u201d, Kyle said, but that presently \u201cthe tide is coming back on it\u201d among MPs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c12e22213df246aff3ca88ae5f2090e22917c6ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c12e22213df246aff3ca88ae5f2090e22917c6ef/0_0_3300_1981/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Labour MP Peter Kyle MP\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Labour MP Peter Kyle MP said support for a second referendum \u2018ebbs and flows\u2019, but the tide was coming back.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PjrNews/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/17/dominic-grieve-pm-boris-johnson-rhetoric-led-directly-to-death-threats\">Dominic Grieve, the former Tory</a> who has led the battle against no-deal Brexit, said MPs bringing back the withdrawal bill with the aim of attaching a second referendum was \u201cwithin the field of options\u201d, but any attempt by backbenchers to bring in primary legislation would be full of procedural hurdles. The legislation would need a money resolution moved by the government, though MPs could hope simply to show progress on finding a majority for any one Brexit option.</p> <p>Grieve said: \u201cPolitics is the art of the possible and clearly it\u2019s been my argument for a long time that it would be desirable to have a second referendum and put the options available to the public to resolve the problems we have.\u201d</p> <p>Others expressed scepticism that such a move would work. Nick Boles, a former Tory minister who voted for Johnson\u2019s deal, tweeted: \u201cThere is no such plan. And it wouldn\u2019t work, as taking a bill of this scale into committee requires a money resolution and Queen\u2019s consent, which only the government can provide.\u201d</p> <p>Last night Johnson was accused of misleading parliament and seeking to tear up provisions for workers\u2019 rights after Brexit. </p> <p>According to the Financial Times, leaked documents indicated the UK government was willing to countenance divergence from EU standards on such rights, as well as other regulations, despite Brussels insisting that any future relationship be based on a level playing field.</p> <p>The shadow Brexit minister, Jenny Chapman, said: \u201cThese documents confirm our worst fears. Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit is a blueprint for a deregulated economy, which will see vital rights and protections torn up.</p> <p>\u201cIt is also clear Boris Johnson was misleading parliament earlier this week. You simply can\u2019t trust a word Boris Johnson says. Under his proposals, this Conservative government has no intention of maintaining high standards after we leave the EU.\u201d</p> <p>Even Conservative supporters of Johnson remained baffled on Friday by the prime minister\u2019s sudden U-turn on his Brexit deal earlier in the week, when he decided to pause it rather than allow more time to debate the legislation.</p> <p>One minister told the Guardian that the views among colleagues was \u201cNo 10 has been churlish\u201d, while a backbench MP said the strategy emerging from Downing Street was \u201cvery confused\u201d and \u201cout of control\u201d.</p> <p>Keith Simpson, Conservative MP for Broadland, described the \u201cfloundering in No 10 as worthy of Baldrick in Blackadder\u201d, adding: \u201cThe problem is that circumstances beyond [Johnson\u2019s] control and things he has done has made 31 October almost impossible and I think what he\u2019s decided to do \u2013 supported by most, but not all of the cabinet \u2013 of trying to have a vote on a general election looks as though it\u2019s part of the people versus parliament but I think it\u2019s quite a risky strategy.\u201d</p>",

They would then attempt to introduce either Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal or Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement, with possible votes on adding a customs union, second referendum and extending transition to prevent departure on World Trade Organization terms. It is understood some MPs have been discussing the plans with former EU officials to determine whether it could be enough to demonstrate to Brussels that parliament was serious about using an extension to break the Brexit deadlock. Johnson was still insisting on Friday that he would refuse to bring back his Brexit legislation unless MPs granted him a general election on Monday. He called on Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, to \u201cman up\u201d and vote for one, claiming that parliament would only engage in \u201cpointless Brexitology\u201d if given the chance to debate his legislation without a hard deadline. Sajid Javid, the chancellor, claimed the government would simply lay motions \u201cagain and again\u201d until other parties agree to go to the polls. However, Corbyn made clear he would only vote for an election if Johnson made \u201cabsolutely clear\u201d to parliament on Monday that there would be no crash-out on WTO terms, because \u201chis deal includes the possibility of a no-deal exit\u201d. Johnson is unlikely to remove the threat of a no-deal exit to Corbyn\u2019s satisfaction because the EU will not formally decide the length of the Brexit extension requested by the UK until early next week. During a meeting of EU diplomats, the French ambassador stood alone in arguing that it was not the right time to agree a three-month delay, in a move that will be welcomed in Downing Street. If the EU ultimately grants a three-month delay and Labour continues to refuse an election, Johnson might not be able to stop the withdrawal agreement being revived by backbenchers. The decision would rest with John Bercow, the Speaker, who could allow it to be \u201cunpaused\u201d by MPs as one of his last acts after a decade in the chair. Labour MP Peter Kyle said he was in talks with ex-Tories about their next steps. Bringing the agreement back to parliament was \u201cone of the options on the shelf\u201d and \u201ccredible\u201d. Kyle said they had done all the preparatory work for this scenario in the summer and were ready to go with such a parliamentary move if needed, but wanted to see what the government and Corbyn did in the next few days. He said he did not believe Johnson\u2019s threat that no Brexit legislation would be brought back to the Commons between now and Christmas, so backbenchers might not need to try and bring back the bill themselves but could amend his deal. Support for a second referendum \u201cebbs and flows\u201d, Kyle said, but that presently \u201cthe tide is coming back on it\u201d among MPs. Dominic Grieve, the former Tory who has led the battle against no-deal Brexit, said MPs bringing back the withdrawal bill with the aim of attaching a second referendum was \u201cwithin the field of options\u201d, but any attempt by backbenchers to bring in primary legislation would be full of procedural hurdles. The legislation would need a money resolution moved by the government, though MPs could hope simply to show progress on finding a majority for any one Brexit option. Grieve said: \u201cPolitics is the art of the possible and clearly it\u2019s been my argument for a long time that it would be desirable to have a second referendum and put the options available to the public to resolve the problems we have.\u201d Others expressed scepticism that such a move would work. Nick Boles, a former Tory minister who voted for Johnson\u2019s deal, tweeted: \u201cThere is no such plan. And it wouldn\u2019t work, as taking a bill of this scale into committee requires a money resolution and Queen\u2019s consent, which only the government can provide.\u201d Last night Johnson was accused of misleading parliament and seeking to tear up provisions for workers\u2019 rights after Brexit. According to the Financial Times, leaked documents indicated the UK government was willing to countenance divergence from EU standards on such rights, as well as other regulations, despite Brussels insisting that any future relationship be based on a level playing field. The shadow Brexit minister, Jenny Chapman, said: \u201cThese documents confirm our worst fears. Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit is a blueprint for a deregulated economy, which will see vital rights and protections torn up. \u201cIt is also clear Boris Johnson was misleading parliament earlier this week. You simply can\u2019t trust a word Boris Johnson says. Under his proposals, this Conservative government has no intention of maintaining high standards after we leave the EU.\u201d Even Conservative supporters of Johnson remained baffled on Friday by the prime minister\u2019s sudden U-turn on his Brexit deal earlier in the week, when he decided to pause it rather than allow more time to debate the legislation. One minister told the Guardian that the views among colleagues was \u201cNo 10 has been churlish\u201d, while a backbench MP said the strategy emerging from Downing Street was \u201cvery confused\u201d and \u201cout of control\u201d. Keith Simpson, Conservative MP for Broadland, described the \u201cfloundering in No 10 as worthy of Baldrick in Blackadder\u201d, adding: \u201cThe problem is that circumstances beyond [Johnson\u2019s] control and things he has done has made 31 October almost impossible and I think what he\u2019s decided to do \u2013 supported by most, but not all of the cabinet \u2013 of trying to have a vote on a general election looks as though it\u2019s part of the people versus parliament but I think it\u2019s quite a risky strategy.\u201d",

He didn\u2019t know if it was night or day and he didn\u2019t know if he was in a location for weeks or months.

      "bodyText": "What might make a young Vietnamese woman leave her home and family to make a dangerous trip across the world in search of a new life in the UK? Most likely, trafficking experts say, it was the promise of work in one of Britain\u2019s proliferating high street nail bars. Reports that a young Vietnamese woman was one of the 39 people who died this week in a refrigerated trailer have not been confirmed by police, but anti-slavery organisations have been trying to raise the alarm for years about the growing problem of Vietnamese children and young adults being trafficked into the UK. Boys are usually sent to work in cannabis farms, locked inside converted houses and forced to tend the plants day and night, while the girls and young women are dispatched to work in nail bars. Both sexes are also frequently forced into prostitution. It is a phenomenon that is hidden in plain sight. Because those trafficked are aware that they are in the UK illegally, they are wary of the police and extremely unlikely to report their own exploitation. Some may not even recognise that they are victims of trafficking, since they may have chosen to travel to the UK in search of work, and will often have paid a people smuggler to organise the journey and to find them a job here. The cost of travelling to Europe typically ranges between $10,000 and $40,000 according to Precarious Journeys, a report on people trafficking from Vietnam, published earlier this year by anti-slavery charities. The brother of Pham Thi Tra My said she had paid \u00a330,000 to people smugglers to get her to the UK, and that this money had been returned to the family overnight as news of the tragedy emerged, according to the BBC. The line between smuggling and trafficking becomes blurred on the journey. Most Vietnamese people working in cannabis farms or in nail bars know that their families at home are heavily in debt to their traffickers, for the cost of their journey, and remain trapped in this debt-bondage for years, trying to repay the debts, and too frightened to seek help. It is a growing problem. While it is hard to get accurate statistics about the real numbers of trafficked Vietnamese people, because most remain hidden and undocumented, new figures from the Salvation Army, which works with victims of trafficking, show that more Vietnamese men were referred to the charity between July 2018 and July 2019 than any other nationality. The charity worked with 209 people from Vietnam over that period, a 248% increase on the number referred five years earlier. The charity Ecpat, which works with child trafficking victims, has also seen a steep rise in the number of Vietnamese referrals, from 135 in 2012 to 704 in 2018. In her final texts, sent from the container as she was dying, Pham says she is from the Ha Tinh province of Vietnam, which is the site of the country\u2019s worst environmental disaster, a chemical spill from a steel factory in 2016 that poisoned up to 125 miles of the northern coastline and devastated the local fishing industry. Mimi Vu, a leading expert on trafficking of Vietnamese young people to Europe and the UK, said she had met a higher than usual number of people from the Ha Tinh province during visits to migrant camps in northern France last week. \u201cThe Ha Tinh environmental disaster has been very problematic for fishermen whose livelihood was taken away. They need money immediately and that has been the push factor for migration,\u201d she said. \u201cShe will probably have come willingly. Her family will have paid for her to go, thinking she will get a job and training in a nail bar in the UK,\u201d said Vu, who has been working in Vietnam on trafficking and slavery issues for the past seven years. This kind of trafficking is precisely the problem that the Modern Slavery Act, introduced by Theresa May in 2015, was supposed to tackle, but while anti-slavery organisations have welcomed the legislation, they have been disappointed at the lack of funding for implementation of its key measures. Debbie Beadle, the director of programmes at the anti-trafficking organisation Ecpat, and co-author of a study into victims of trafficking from Vietnam to Europe published earlier this year, said: \u201cThe resources haven\u2019t come to put it into effect. Many police forces and local authorities are still not trained or equipped to identify these victims of trafficking.\u201d Because victims are not regularly being identified, there have been fewer successful prosecutions under the new human trafficking legislation than expected. The first successful nail bar prosecution was last January, when three people were found guilty of conspiring to facilitate the movement of people for labour exploitation. Police found two Vietnamese girls working at the Nail Bar Deluxe in Bath. Both were working 60 hour weeks; one was being paid about \u00a330 a month, while the other was not paid, and slept on a mattress in the attic of the nail bar owner\u2019s home. They had been smuggled into the UK in the back of a lorry. Often the victims are too frightened to cooperate with the police, and not recognised as victims of trafficking and are instead treated as criminals and deported back to Vietnam, where they are frequently retrafficked by the people smugglers who took them out of the country originally. Because victims are so frightened of their traffickers they are usually very unwilling to speak about their experiences, even when they have been rehoused, and this reticence has contributed to the phenomenon remaining relatively little understood. But in an interview with the Guardian last year, Stephen, a vulnerable Vietnamese orphan, described being trafficked to the UK to work as an enslaved cannabis farmer when he was 10 years old. Stephen, whose real name was not revealed to prevent him being identified by his traffickers, arrived in Britain in the back of a freezer lorry, after a long journey on foot and in trucks from Hanoi, where he had been destitute and homeless. In Britain, he was locked up alone in a series of terraced houses that had been converted into cannabis farms, and forced over the course of four years to work as a cannabis gardener by the Vietnamese gang that had smuggled him here. It was impossible to look out of the windows, he said, because they were all covered with thick insulating plastic. He didn\u2019t know if it was night or day and he didn\u2019t know if he was in a location for weeks or months. Every few days, in the evening, a group of Vietnamese men would come to inspect the plants, bringing him food. \u201cSometimes I did something wrong that made some plants die. They would get angry and beat me. My life was much worse than when I lived in Vietnam.\u201d Once, a gang of British drug dealers kicked a door down, tied him up, and stole the entire cannabis harvest. When his own minders returned, they were angry, but simply moved him on to a new location, where he had to begin the process of cultivating cannabis seedlings again. In the next house, they no longer locked him inside, but they told him they would find him and kill him if he tried to escape. He never tried to flee because he had no idea where to go. \u201cI just lived day by day,\u201d he said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t see anything in the future. No one was kind to me.\u201d Beadle said most of the victims the charity worked with had travelled to the UK hidden in the back of lorries. \u201cThey usually describe it as one of the most traumatic experiences of their lives.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Finally, the FTSE 100 index ended just 3 points lower at 7,324, lagging the rest of Europe. France gained 0.6%, while Germany gained 0.17% despite the skid in consumer confidence. The IFO survey, showing stabilising business confidence, helped. Goodnight! Having canned the budget, the government is facing calls to release the latest growth and borrowing forecasts...... ...unless they\u2019ve something to hide? Blunder of the day goes to the Office For National Statistics, for overstating public borrowing by up to \u00a31.5bn this year. Sterling is ending the weak on a low point - it\u2019s now down almost half a cent today, just above $1.28. Tom Rosser, investment research analyst at The Share Centre, says political uncertainty is hurting: Yesterday, Boris laid down the gauntlet in challenging MPs to give him a general election on 12 December. For investors this creates a difficult environment. Sterling reached levels not seen since May at the start of the week, but with a snap election looking likely and with uncertainty persisting, it has since fallen back. The only thing that is certain is heightened volatility for the currency. The New York stock market has made a very subdued start to trading. The Dow has risen just 0.07%, gaining 20 points to 26,826, while the broader S&amp;P 500 has dipped by 0.08%. There are some significant moves, though. Amazon has fallen 3.6% after missing Wall Street profit forecasts following an investment splurge. I reckon that\u2019s knocked around $3.6bn off Jeff Bezos\u2019s stake in the company he founded -- leaving him roughly neck-and-neck with Bill Gates as the world\u2019s richest person. Gold, a traditional safe-haven in troubled times, has jumped 1% this morning to $1,517 per ounce - it\u2019s highest level sine late September. Tire maker Goodyear has missed expectations, though, with sales down 3% in the third quarter. Earnings also came in below forecasts, prompting CEO Richard Kramer to blame the weak European economy: \u201cIndustry conditions were softer than we anticipated in Europe and we continued to see an adverse impact from lack of alignment in our distribution channels. In response, we expect to accelerate our plans to rationalize distribution in the region. Jaguar Land Rover has some cheering news -- it\u2019s returned to profit. The UK car maker says sales picked up in China, while strong demand for the Range Rover Evoque SUV vehicle also helped. This delivered a \u00a3156m pre-tax profit in the last quarter, up from a \u00a3395m loss in April-June. Ralf Speth, boss of the Midlands car manufacturer, says the JLR turnaround plan is firmly on track. That must be a relief to workers at its car plants in Castle Bromwich and Solihull, although Brexit uncertainty still looms over the industry. Marketwatch is reporting that the possibility of a Labour government is also weighing on the City. They say: Lucy Macdonald, chief investment officer for global equities at Allianz Global Investors, said in addition to uncertainty surrounding the Brexit outcome, the policy proposals of the opposition Labour Party under leader Jeremy Corbyn have also affected sentiment. \u201cAnother reason why global investors have been nervous about the U.K. has been the threat of an extreme left-wing government. Although that looks a lower risk because of where the polls are, it is still a risk,\u201d said Macdonald. More here: U.K. assets are too hot to handle right now, top investors say That may explain why utilities -- a nationalisation target for Labour - are the worst-performing sector on the FTSE 100 this morning. But, Labour are currently lagging in the polls, and there\u2019s no guarantee of an election soon anyway (despite Boris Johnson\u2019s goading of Jeremy Corbyn to \u2018man up\u2019 today...). Billionaire Watch: Jeff Bezos could lose his crown as the world\u2019s richest man today. Amazon\u2019s stock price is on track to fall around 6% when the New York stock market opens (2.30pm BST / 9.30am EST). That would knock roughly $6bn off Bezos\u2019s personal wealth, I estimate. And that\u2019s just enough to send him below Bill Gates on the Bloomberg Billionaire\u2019s index (yesterday, Bezos was worth $111bn, followed by Gates at $107bn). Investors aren\u2019t impressed by Amazon\u2019s sharp fall in profits in the last quarter, or its decision to lower its earnings forecasts (details here). Bezos explained last night that Amazon is investing more in Prime, its next-day delivery service. But some shareholders would rather it focused on profits. Brent Thill, an analyst at Jefferies, explained (via the FT): \u201cThe key takeaway is they are shifting from harvest mode to investment mode and it\u2019s coming at the cost of the bottom line. That\u2019s a different tone. Suddenly we are back to the old Amazon.\u201d Several UK-focused companies are among the fallers on the FTSE 100 today. Property giant British Land, supermarket chain Sainsbury, telecoms group BT and holiday provider TUI have all dropped, reflecting Brexit worries. Fiona Cincotta of City Index says: In what is beginning to look more like a high stakes poker game then legitimate politics the Prime Minister said he would ask MPs to agree on Monday to a general election before Christmas. If they disagree he indicated that he would freeze his Brexit legislation making it impossible for Parliament to make any progress in debating the current proposal. The FTSE 100 is currently down 33 point, or 0.5%, as traders scramble for a lunchtime sandwich. The mid-cap FTSE 250 index, of medium-sized listed companies, has dropped by 0.7%- to its lowest level since last Wednesday. Cincotta says Amazon\u2019s weak results have also pushed shares down: A weaker close on Wall Street also contributed to the FTSE\u2019s decline particularly after Amazon reported the first drop in quarterly profits since 2017 and warned that there would be more declines during its busiest season in the year. On Brexit, the EU has just announced that leaders have agreed \u201cin principle\u201d to granting the UK a Brexit extension. But they haven\u2019t finalised the details (the length, or the terms), and will make a final decision next week. They appear to be waiting until MPs have decided whether a general election should be held in December, putting the ball back into Westminster\u2019s court. Ricardo Evangelista, senior analyst at ActivTrades, says Brexit \u2018absurdity\u2019 and \u2018surrealism\u2019 is pushing the pound towards a one-week low. The latest political twist keeping sterling under pressure has a touch of surrealism about it: Boris Johnson is asking for an early election, for which he\u2019ll need the support of Labour MPs; Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, said he will support an early election, but only if the EU has granted a Brexit extension and no deal is off the table. However, the EU will only grant a new extension if the British side has a clearly defined plan. There is an absurdity about the situation and the markets are reacting by once again walking away from the pound. Our latest Brexit Dashboard is out, and shows that the prolonged economic uncertainty is hurting the jobs market. My colleague Richard Partington explains: Brexit uncertainty has begun driving up job losses across Britain as political turmoil holds back the economy, according to a Guardian analysis of economic news over the past month. In a sign of the mounting stress on the UK, the number of people in work dropped by the largest margin in four years in August as companies put their hiring plans on hold, with firms losing contracts and facing delays because of the uncertainty over Britain\u2019s future. , some bright patches remain, including official figures suggesting that a summer recession has been avoided. Here\u2019s the key data: Economist Danny Blanchflower says the government must reveal the economic impact of Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal: It is disgraceful that Sajid Javid has refused to publish economic analysis of the deal parliament has been offered by the government. This is either utter incompetence or they are trying to hide bad news, or both. Fellow economist Andrew Sentance is also concerned about Brexit\u2019s impact on the economy: The UK economy is likely to continue to grow at a modest pace, driven by consumer spending and the services sector. But manufacturing industries will continue to struggle \u2013 not least because it is the part of the economy most exposed to the negative aspects of Brexit. Though economic growth is continuing, the UK economy is becoming more unbalanced, not less so. That is one of the many unfortunate consequences of Brexit. More here: Here\u2019s my colleague Jasper Jolly on the probe into the Boeing 737 MAX: The final report by Indonesian investigators into the crash of a Boeing 737 Max plane flown by Indonesia\u2019s Lion Air that left 189 people dead has found that problems with Boeing\u2019s design, the airline\u2019s maintenance of the jet and pilot errors contributed to the disaster. The report into the October 2018 crash criticised the US planemaker\u2019s new anti-stall system, MCAS, that automatically pushed the plane\u2019s nose down, leaving pilots fighting for control. The 737 Max\u2019s MCAS system is also at the centre of separate investigations into an Ethiopian Airlines crash in March that killed 159 people. Boeing\u2019s 737 Max planes were grounded worldwide in the wake of the crashes. More here: Germany\u2019s government isn\u2019t bowing to pressure to launch a stimulus programme, according to these newsflashes: That\u2019s despite Mario Draghi using his final press conference as ECB president to urge governments with fiscal space to boost their spending. London\u2019s stock market is ending the week on a poor note, as political uncertainty worries traders. The FTSE 100 index has dropped by 37 points, or 0.5%, this morning - putting it on track for its first daily loss this week. Optimism that Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union has been replaced by a familiar, and non-too-tasty, cocktail of doubts. Will we have another general election soon? How far will the Brexit deadline be pushed back? If No-Deal really off the table? EU leaders are now considering pausing their decision on a Brexit extension, until MPs have decided whether to trigger a December election: The pound is also slightly lower this morning, at $1.283. It hit $1.30 on Monday, on hopes that Johnson could get his deal through parliament. But it\u2019s been sliding since, after MPs refused to pass the legislation rapidly. ING economist James Smith suspects Johnson could \u2018unpause\u2019 his deal soon: \u201cParliament looks poised to reject UK Prime Minister Johnson\u2019s third attempt at triggering a general election. That means the UK may not go to the polls until 2020, and that could prove risky for the Conservatives. Despite all the noise, if MPs reject a December election, we suspect the PM will refocus on getting the Brexit legislation through Westminster.\u201d Katharina Uterm\u00f6hl of Allianz is also encouraged by the stabilisation in German business confidence this month: But Carsten Brzeski of ING says Germany still risks \u2018Japanification\u2019: Relief, unfortunately, is not the same as a rebound. However, after endless disappointing macro data out of Germany, today\u2019s Ifo reading gives hope that at least a bottoming out could be in sight. Still, the risk of a long flirt with stagnation remains high and with it the risk of a Japanification of the German economy. A bittersweet victory against a real recession, as such a stagnation would give the comfort of avoiding a severe crisis, while at the same time reducing the urgency to add. Economists are encouraged by the news that Germany\u2019s business morale slump has bottomed out this month. Nadia Gharbi of Pictet Asset Management has spotted an upturn in manufacturing: Aila Mihr of Danske Bank points out that Germany is still in a downswing, though: Newsflash: The slump in German business confidence may have bottomed out. That\u2019s according to a survey of 9,000 companies by the IFO Institute, just released. IFO\u2019s measure of German business morale has come in at 94.6, matching September\u2019s reading. That\u2019s worryingly close to the seven-year low recorded in August. But while firms are more pessimistic about economic conditions today, they\u2019re a little more upbeat about future prospects (although this morning\u2019s drop in confidence might make them rethink...) Here\u2019s the details: Current conditions index: 97.8, down from 98.6 in September. Future prospects index: 91.5, up from 90.9 Clemens Fuest, president of IFO, says that fears of a no-deal Brexit are receding. Signs of progress in US-China trade war are also helping. He declares: The German economy is stabilising. Fuest also predicted that the German economy would grow slightly in the current quarter, which could lift it out of recession (assuming the economy continued to shrink in Q3). Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world\u2019s largest beer maker, has also disappointing the markets this morning by cutting its profit forecasts. AB, maker of Budweiser, Corona and Leffe, suffered a 0.5% drop in beer volume sales in the last quarter. This dragged underlying profits down to $1.87bn for Q3, from $2.19bn a year earlier. AB says it only expects moderate profit growth for 2019, citing \u201csofter macroeconomic conditions\u201d in its key markets. AB told investors: The third quarter of 2019 was challenging, primarily driven by three anticipated factors: shipment phasing into 2Q19 in China ahead of summer activations, higher cost of sales per hectolitre from significant commodity and transactional currency headwinds, and the year-over-year phasing of our sales and marketing investments driven by the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia. In addition, price increases implemented in South Korea and Brazil drove volume declines, which were exacerbated by softer consumer demand in light of difficult macroeconomic conditions. Shares have plunged 10% this morning, to their lowest level since June. Here\u2019s our story on Barclays\u2019 results: In the City, advertising giant WPP has jumped to the top of the FTSE 100 risers after reporting a pick-up in revenues despite economic jitters. WPP posted a 1.9% jump in like-for-like sales in the last quarter, after landing new clients including Mondelez and eBay. That\u2019s an improvement on the 0.9% decline in the first half of 2019. CEO Mark Read, who took over last September, says:, \u201cOur growth in Q3 is encouraging but we are focused on delivering these longer-term goals and know there will be twists and turns along the way. Our guidance for 2019 remains unchanged. Shares are up 5%. UK bank Barclays is also sounding more anxious too. CEO Jes Staley warned this morning that: The outlook for next year is unquestionably more challenging now than it appeared a year ago, in particular given the uncertainty around the UK economy and the interest rate environment. Staley also popped up on Bloomberg TV, where he cited the uncertainty created by a possible general election. Staley was speaking as Barclays announced its third-quarter results, which have been dented by yet another compensation bill for mis-selling PPI insurance. Pre-tax profits have slid to just \u00a3246m in the last quarter, down from \u00a31,531m in Q2, thanks to a new \u00a31.4bn provision for PPI. After a late rush ahead of the deadline this summer, Barclays is handling more than two million claims, enquiries and information requests at various stages of processing. Surprisingly, they also have time for some actual banking -- pre-tax profits at the corporate and investment bank rose by around 77% year on-year, to \u00a3882m from \u00a3492m. GfK fears that the risk of a German recession has risen, saying: Combined with the trade conflict, the global cooling off of the economy, which will especially impact the strongly export-oriented German economy, will not leave the German economy unscathed. Consequently, several automobile manufacturers as well as their suppliers have already announced redundancies. It also cites the major job cuts being imposed by Deutsche Bank: Owing to the European Central Bank\u2019s (ECB) low-interest-rate policy, banks are experiencing increasing difficulties. As the example of Deutsche Bank shows, they are reacting with branch closures and redundancies. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The storm clouds over Germany\u2019s economy have darkened again this morning, with consumer morale hitting a three-year low. The Nuremberg-based GfK institute has reported that Germans are more pessimistic about the economic outlook, making them more reluctant to spend. This pulled GfK\u2019s consumer sentiment index down, from 9.8 to 9.6, which is the weakest reading since November 2016. The global economic downturn, trade conflicts and \u201cBrexit chaos\u201d all making people gloomier, GfK says. Rising job cuts at carmakers and banks are hurting too. \u201cThese events have dampened the mood of consumers again and optimism is dwindling,\u201d GfK researcher Rolf Buerkl said, adding that Berlin\u2019s government could act to stem the downturn. Private consumption will remain an important pillar for the German economy this year \u2013 assuming that the current crises do not escalate further and both policy and the economy counter the rising fear of job losses.\u201d There are widespread fears that Germany, Europe\u2019s largest economy, could have fallen into recession in the last quarter (we get the data next month). The wider eurozone doesn\u2019t look terribly healthy either. Yesterday, Mario Draghi signed off from the ECB by warning of \u201ca protracted weakness in the euro area growth dynamics\u201d. The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain on the downside. In particular, these risks pertain to the prolonged presence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors, rising protectionism, and vulnerabilities in emerging markets.\u201d German consumers, it seems, have already got the message.... Also coming up today There\u2019s some anxiety in the tech sector after Amazon reported a sharp drop in profits last night, due to the cost of ramping up its Prime delivery service. My colleague Dominic Rushe explains: Amazon\u2019s profits slid 26% in the last quarter as the company poured money into free shipping and its cloud storage business. While the company\u2019s revenues rose sharply, up 24% to $70bn for the quarter or more than $23bn a month, its profits fell to $2.1bn down from $2.9bn from a year earlier. The financial miss comes as Amazon is facing greater scrutiny from Washington, with politicians from both sides calling for investigations of its business practices. With Texas Instruments, McDonalds, Caterpillar and Twitter already missing market expectations this week, it\u2019s turning into a mixed reporting season. The pound could come under pressure as EU leaders deliberate whether to grant the UK another Brexit extension, and for how long. Sterling is currently hovering around $1.285, awaiting developments (like the rest of us). Traders will also be watching whether Boris Johnson manages to persuade MPs to hold a general election in December (very festive!). Labour aren\u2019t keen to head to the polls, so the PM could be thwarted. The official report into the Boeing 737 MAX crash in Indonesia a year ago, which killed 189 people, is being released, and could be pretty damning According to Reuters, it will recommend closer scrutiny of automated control systems, improved design of flight deck alerts and better accounting for a more diverse pilot population.

      "bodyText": "Detectives investigating the deaths of 39 people found inside a lorry in Essex have made a fourth arrest. A 48-year-old man from Northern Ireland was arrested at Stansted airport on Friday on suspicion of conspiracy to traffic people and on suspicion of manslaughter after the bodies of 31 men and eight women were discovered in a refrigerated trailer in Grays early on Wednesday morning, Essex police said. Earlier in the day, a man and a woman, both 38 and from Warrington, were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to traffic people and on suspicion of manslaughter in connection with the 39 deaths, following morning raids at addresses in Cheshire. The 25-year-old driver of the lorry, Mo Robinson, from Northern Ireland, who was arrested in the early hours of Wednesday following the discovery, remains in custody. As police began moving bodies from the port of Tilbury to the mortuary at Broomfield hospital in Chelmsford for postmortem examinations, Vietnamese families expressed concern for relatives they feared were among the dead. Essex police said on Thursday they believed the 31 men and eight women were Chinese nationals, but on Friday they cautioned that \u201cas our investigations continue, the picture may change regarding identification\u201d. Pippa Mills, the deputy chief constable, said the force would not comment further on the nationalities of the victims. \u201cWe gave an initial steer on Thursday on nationality, however this is now a developing picture,\u201d she said. \u201cAs such I will not be drawn on any further detail until formal identification processes approved by Her Majesty\u2019s coroner have taken place.\u201d She said those processes would take place alongside the examinations to establish the causes of death. \u201cThis process is likely to be a lengthy one, but it is crucial, and we\u2019re working with Her Majesty\u2019s coroner to ensure the dignity of the victims and the respect for their loved ones is at the forefront of our investigation.\u201d Mills urged anyone who thought their friends or relatives may have been in the trailer to contact the force, as well as individuals who may be \u201cliving illegally in this country\u201d. \u201cPlease come forward and speak to us without fear,\u201d she said. \u201cI can assure you that your information will be received in strictest confidence and no criminal action will be taken against you.\u201d The man and woman arrested in Warrington are thought to be Joanna and Thomas Maher, who told reporters they had previously owned the cab driven by Robinson but sold it 13 months ago to a company in County Monaghan. Detectives from Cheshire police were searching a house in the Woolston area of Warrington on Friday where the couple and their three children have lived for the past two years. Police cars and vans came and went from the detached property throughout the morning and plainclothes officers were seen entering the house carrying boxes. Two grey Range Rover Discovery vehicles with matching personalised number plates and a white Chevrolet sports car were parked on the drive. The Mahers told reporters on Thursday night they had sold the cab and felt disgust and shock at the fate of the migrants. The couple, who have not been seen since, were described by neighbours as \u201cjust another normal family\u201d.. One neighbour who did not want to be named said: \u201cWe have a friendly, neighbourly relationship. Both Thomas and Joanne are very approachable. I am very shocked but we don\u2019t know the truth of it all yet. I know that Joanne has said that she sold the cab, so who knows?\u201d The couple are believed to own at least two businesses in the Warrington area and previously lived in a more modest house about two miles away. The route taken by the lorry trailer will be one of the key priorities of the cross-border investigation. Police confirmed the trailer was picked up at Purfleet at 12.30am on Wednesday, just over an hour before they were alerted to the discovery of the bodies and attended the scene at an industrial park in Grays. The trailer, which had arrived from Zeebrugge in Belgium, was leased from one Irish company, the Monaghan-based Global Trailer Rental Europe, on 15 October to another business on the Irish border. It was the first time the second business had made such a leasing arrangement. GPS data from the refrigerated unit shows that it left Monaghan on 15 October and crossed into Northern Ireland and then back south into Ireland, sources have said. It then travelled from Dublin port to the UK overnight on 16 October, and crossed to mainland Europe that evening. The trailer travelled to Dunkirk and Lille in France, and Bruges in Belgium. Dunkirk is a 40-minute drive from Calais and is a known site for people smugglers preying on migrants seeking to cross the Channel to the UK. The data from the tracking device, which has been passed to Essex police investigating the deaths, also shows the trailer made a journey between the UK and mainland Europe on 22 October. The Vietnamese embassy in London confirmed it has contacted police in regard to a missing woman feared to be one of the 39 victims. A spokesman for the embassy said they had been contacted by a family in Vietnam who claimed their daughter had been missing \u201csince the lorry was found\u201d. The spokesman said: \u201cWe have contacted Essex police and we are waiting for an answer.\u201d",

Contraflow systems and partial motorway closures will be implemented this weekend to ensure Operation Brock can begin at 6am on Monday, the day parliament votes on whether to hold a snap general election. With the EU yet to decide on whether it will offer the UK an extension to article 50, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, favouring a delay of just two weeks, Highways England decided it could not take the chance. The agency said it had decided at 4pm on Friday to put the operation into place, which will cause huge disruption for local traffic in Kent. Under the contingency plan, part of the eastbound M20 \u2013 the main artery to Dover and the Eurotunnel at nearby Folkestone \u2013 will be closed to normal traffic and made exclusively available for lorries. Other vehicles will instead use the London-bound side of the M20 in a contraflow system. Up to 2,800 lorries will be managed in slow-moving lanes on the eastbound carriageway between junctions eight and nine. \u201cOperation Brock is part of a set of measures put in place to allow the M20 and the rest of Kent to keep moving in the event of cross-Channel disruption.

The food industry, which relies heavily on the Calais-Dover route for fresh imports, said it was \u201cstill on a war footing\u201d as it believed a no-deal Brexit was a distinct possibility. It fears the instigation of Operation Brock would be in itself disruptive as it could prevent delivery lorries getting through in good time. The activation of the contingency plans came hours after it emerged that the government was also continuing with its taxpayer-funded adverts advising the public to prepare for Brexit on 31 October.",

A QuickQuid customer taking out a \u00a3250 loan for three and a half months would be charged interest rates equal to an annual percentage rate of 1,300%, according to an example on the lender\u2019s website.</p> <p>The FCA imposed affordability checks and capped payday loan charges in 2014 to stop lenders charging more in fees and interest than the amount borrowed. The changes, designed to protect vulnerable consumers, reduced the lenders\u2019 income and triggered a flurry of customer complaints, often encouraged by claims handlers.</p> <p>Consumer finance experts have said if QuickQuid customers do not keep up payments they potentially face having to pay extra charges or suffer black marks on their credit records.</p> <p>For those customers who have made compensation claims against QuickQuid but whose cases are still outstanding, the outlook is not good after the official body that deals with complaints in the financial services industry said it might not be able to process any more claims. </p> <p>The Financial Ombudsman Service said: \u201cIt is unlikely we will be able to progress any existing complaints about CashEuroNet [which includes QuickQuid] any further, or look at any new complaints about it.\u201d</p> <p>The Money and Pensions Service, an official body sponsored by the Department for Work and Pensions, said many customers would be feeling uncertain about what this latest development meant for them.</p> <p>But Caroline Siarkiewicz, the service\u2019s acting chief executive, said: \u201cWhile you may be tempted to stop your repayments, it is crucial to keep to your regular schedule, because if you have entered into a loan agreement, you must fulfil it. If you miss any repayments, you could be hit by fees and additional charges, and it could also harm your credit rating.\u201d</p> <p>The legal obligation for customers to repay their debts will almost certainly remain unchanged, and it may be that those who fail to make their repayments have their account passed to a debt recovery agency.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Your Lawyers, a law firm specialising in compensation cases, said an estimated 10,000 complaints against QuickQuid were outstanding and that, potentially, around 6,000 of those would be likely to have had their complaints upheld. These people may now end up out of pocket, it said. These types of complaints often relate to affordability \u2013 for example, a borrower claims that the checks a firm should have carried out were not done properly.</p> <p>John Cullen, business recovery partner at accountancy firm Menzies LLP, said: \u201cFor former customers, who feel they have been taken advantage of and are in financial hardship, the future is still uncertain, as the value of any compensation payouts will now depend on the process of closing the company.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is clear is that in the face of growing regulatory pressures, the curtain appears to be drawing on the payday lender market.\u201d</p> <p>The ombudsman service said on its website: \u201cWe will be working with the administrators of the company to understand what that means for consumers, but it is unlikely that we will be able to progress any existing complaints about CashEuroNet any further, or look at any new complaints about it.\u201d</p>",

A QuickQuid customer taking out a \u00a3250 loan for three and a half months would be charged interest rates equal to an annual percentage rate of 1,300%, according to an example on the lender\u2019s website. The FCA imposed affordability checks and capped payday loan charges in 2014 to stop lenders charging more in fees and interest than the amount borrowed. The changes, designed to protect vulnerable consumers, reduced the lenders\u2019 income and triggered a flurry of customer complaints, often encouraged by claims handlers. Consumer finance experts have said if QuickQuid customers do not keep up payments they potentially face having to pay extra charges or suffer black marks on their credit records. For those customers who have made compensation claims against QuickQuid but whose cases are still outstanding, the outlook is not good after the official body that deals with complaints in the financial services industry said it might not be able to process any more claims. The Financial Ombudsman Service said: \u201cIt is unlikely we will be able to progress any existing complaints about CashEuroNet [which includes QuickQuid] any further, or look at any new complaints about it.\u201d The Money and Pensions Service, an official body sponsored by the Department for Work and Pensions, said many customers would be feeling uncertain about what this latest development meant for them. But Caroline Siarkiewicz, the service\u2019s acting chief executive, said: \u201cWhile you may be tempted to stop your repayments, it is crucial to keep to your regular schedule, because if you have entered into a loan agreement, you must fulfil it. If you miss any repayments, you could be hit by fees and additional charges, and it could also harm your credit rating.\u201d The legal obligation for customers to repay their debts will almost certainly remain unchanged, and it may be that those who fail to make their repayments have their account passed to a debt recovery agency. Your Lawyers, a law firm specialising in compensation cases, said an estimated 10,000 complaints against QuickQuid were outstanding and that, potentially, around 6,000 of those would be likely to have had their complaints upheld. These people may now end up out of pocket, it said. These types of complaints often relate to affordability \u2013 for example, a borrower claims that the checks a firm should have carried out were not done properly. John Cullen, business recovery partner at accountancy firm Menzies LLP, said: \u201cFor former customers, who feel they have been taken advantage of and are in financial hardship, the future is still uncertain, as the value of any compensation payouts will now depend on the process of closing the company. \u201cWhat is clear is that in the face of growing regulatory pressures, the curtain appears to be drawing on the payday lender market.\u201d The ombudsman service said on its website: \u201cWe will be working with the administrators of the company to understand what that means for consumers, but it is unlikely that we will be able to progress any existing complaints about CashEuroNet any further, or look at any new complaints about it.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The UK government is coming under mounting pressure to publish economic forecasts after scrapping its plan to hold an early November budget, as Boris Johnson pushes for a snap election before Christmas. In a development that effectively blocks the release of the forecasts, the chancellor, Sajid Javid, confirmed on Friday he would not deliver his set piece tax and spending event on 6 November as planned. It comes as the government refuses to carry out a detailed impact assessment of its Brexit deal. The decision means the Office for Budget Responsibility, the Treasury\u2019s official forecaster, will not publish updated growth forecasts and a key health check on the public finances, which was likely to include an assessment of the Brexit plan. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, accused Dominic Cummings, Johnson\u2019s most senior adviser, of forcing Javid to shelve the budget because the OBR report would have revealed spiralling levels of public borrowing and a worsening growth outlook. McDonnell said: \u201cWe suspect that one of the reasons for Dominic Cummings pulling the budget is that the government has panicked over the publication of accompanying forecasts, which clearly would have exposed the perilous economic situation as a result of its Brexit proposal. \u201cWe are demanding that the OBR\u2019s report be published and are exploring what parliamentary devices are available to secure this.\u201d Javid has denied being forced to shelve the budget, despite appearing on TV late on Wednesday to say it was still scheduled. He told the BBC\u2019s Today programme on Friday: \u201cIt was a decision that I\u2019ve made but with the prime minister because we both agree.\u201d He added: \u201cThe entire cabinet agreed when we had the cabinet meeting [on Thursday]. But the prime minister and I agreed well before that that the most important thing is going to be that we get Brexit done and then we have this general election.\u201d Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the tax and spending thinktank, said the government would have been embarrassed by an OBR report saying the public finances and the outlook for growth was worsening. He added: \u201cWe don\u2019t have the official view of the public finances and whatever Brexit scenario they would have run alongside it. \u201cIn a world in which we have an election before we have the next OBR forecasts, I suppose the concern is we\u2019ll end up in the bad old days of people either making up their own forecasts or relying on what we know are very out of date numbers from March.\u201d The OBR has already warned the government is on-track to overshoot its borrowing target by at least \u00a38bn this year as borrowing levels rise, while the IFS has said the government had effectively abandoned its own tax and spending rules, as the prime minister ramps up spending on the NHS, schools and policing.

Lawrence was born during an influenza pandemic, which killed his mother when he was a baby. He was taken into care by Jesuits who had a mission there. Lawrence attended Kutama College, where Robert Mugabe was also educated. Although Mugabe was seven years younger, the two became well acquainted when Lawrence returned as a teacher.</p> <p>He had been destined for the priesthood and he spent three years at a seminary. However, he decided instead to become a teacher and travelled to South Africa to do his training at the South African Native College, which became the University of Fort Hare.</p> <p>After teaching for around five years, he joined African Newspapers as a journalist in 1946 and rose to become editor-in-chief of the group in Rhodesia. As a result of his experience, in 1959 he was sent to London as the press attache of the embassy of the Central African Federation, consisting of what were then Southern and Northern Rhodesia, and Nyasaland (later Zimbabwe, Zambia and Malawi).</p> <p>In the 1940s he had married Cathleen Rolands. He brought his young family of three daughters and a son with him to London, while their mother remained in Rhodesia. The marriage ended in divorce. A second marriage in London, to Kay Boyer, which also ended in divorce, produced two daughters.</p> <p>Lawrence was a strong proponent of the Federation; but this was doomed when the Rhodesia Front, which was intent on white supremacy, came to power. When violence and repression broke out in Southern Rhodesia, he resigned his post to become, in 1962, an employee of the Anglo-American mining corporation. This employment lasted until 1970 and it took him to Salisbury (now Harare), to Lusaka and, finally, back to London.</p> <p>It was in London that he wrote An Ill-fated People: Zimbabwe Before and After Rhodes (1972), which covered the country\u2019s history from 1890 until the 1950s. A subsequent book, From Rhodesia to Zimbabwe (1976), updated the story.</p> <p>With the advent of independence in 1980, Lawrence returned to Zimbabwe as a businessman and as an occasional journalist. His byline in the African daily paper was \u201cZingese\u201d, which translates, by his own account, as madcap bumblebee. He wrote stinging and humorous political commentaries. Lawrence had high hopes for the future of his country at the time, but he became increasingly doubtful of the Mugabe regime.</p> <p>In 2001, Lawrence returned to the UK to spend his retirement with his third wife, Mary (nee Fletcher), in Telford, in her home county of Shropshire. After Mary died in 2013, he came to live with my family in London.</p> <p>A daughter, Patricia, predeceased him. He is survived by two daughters, Elizabeth (my wife)and Virginia, and a son, Lawrence, from his first marriage, and by two daughters, Antoinette and Janine, from his second marriage.</p>",

Injuries have made us go into this position but it\u2019s working quite well.\u201d United struggled once more to create opportunities against Partizan, the winner coming from a Martial penalty, this again showing up Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s lack of midfield options. \u201cWe\u2019ve not created as many as we like, we\u2019ve not scored as many as we\u2019d like,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said. \u201cAnthony\u2019s back, got a goal and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll see us improve as a team with Anthony in it because he does give us something different.\u201d Solsjaer is wary of Sunday\u2019s opponents, who this season impressed against Liverpool before losing, and defeated Manchester City, the champions. \u201cWhen I watched the first game against Liverpool, I saw a team with lots of courage: they were brave, they played their own way and they kept going and that has given them some great results,\u201d said Solskj\u00e6r. \u201cWhen they beat Newcastle, when they beat Manchester City, [they showed they are] a team with a clear philosophy on how they want to play. So, I hope we\u2019re going to stop them, because it\u2019s always difficult down at Carrow Road. \u201cBut we\u2019re ready for it now. We\u2019ve been to Belgrade, got some players back, I managed to take Aaron [Wan-Bissaka] and Anthony off after 60 minutes because they\u2019ve been out for a long time. So hopefully we\u2019ll have a fresh team because we need to be at our best to have a chance.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2><strong>Monday</strong></h2> <p>The only thing any of us can be certain about is that we will die. Most of us \u2013 myself included \u2013 only manage to cope with this knowledge by burying it deep into our subconscious and living each day as if we and those we love are immortal. I\u2019m much less of a hypochondriac than I was 20 years ago and I\u2019m still not sure if that is a sign of improved mental health or whether my levels of denial about the inevitability of death have dug in deeper.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/03/rachel-clarke-your-life-in-my-hands-interview\">Rachel Clarke</a> should be essential reading for all of us. A few years ago she wrote <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/your-life-in-my-hands.html\">Your Life in My Hands</a>, an account of her time as a junior doctor. Now she has written an even better book which I was lucky enough to receive as an advance copy. Dear Life is the story of her work as a palliative care doctor at a hospice in Oxford. It is in part a love letter both to her father, whose life and death she describes with great tenderness and unflinching directness, and her patients, but it is also a touching and profound meditation on what it means to be human.</p> <p>If it sounds depressing, it isn\u2019t. Rather it is uplifting. We can\u2019t all choose the manner of our death \u2013 some will be gentle, some violent, some quick, some prolonged \u2013 but we can choose how we live with that knowledge. As Clarke writes, the only difference between the dying and the rest of us is that the dying are aware just how little time they have left. It is the love that we choose to invest in each other despite the inevitability of the accompanying grief that really counts. It is a remarkable book. Pre-order it now.</p> <h2><strong>Tuesday</strong></h2> <p>There can\u2019t be many worse days to hold a book launch than on the night in half-term when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/22/what-just-happened-in-the-commons-and-whats-next-for-brexit\">government chooses to hold votes</a> both on the second reading and programme motion of its Brexit withdrawal bill and when Spurs are playing against Red Star Belgrade in the Champions League.</p> <p>At one point, I wasn\u2019t even sure I\u2019d be able to turn up to my own launch myself. I spent most of the day in a state of near panic worrying that there would be just me, the publisher and a few bemused stragglers who happened to be shopping in Daunt\u2019s bookshop in Marylebone for the party to celebrate the publication of my latest collection of sketches, Decline and Fail.</p> <p>When I wrote <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/i-maybot-9781783351596.html\">I, Maybot</a> a couple of years ago, it never really occurred to me there would be a Brexit sequel. Now it\u2019s rather looking as if we are two books in to a trilogy. Or possibly a tetralogy. As it was, I was touched that so many friends turned up and the place was rammed, despite many lobby journalists and Spurs fans being otherwise engaged. Even I had to admit that it was a success, though it wasn\u2019t without its stresses as I had to dash off to a pub at the end to watch the two votes and subsequent points of order on playback so that I could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/commentisfree/2019/oct/22/boris-johnson-die-in-a-ditch-brexit-timetable-dead-from-a-glitch\">complete the day\u2019s sketch</a>. I then discovered that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/22/tottenham-hotspur-red-star-belgrade-champions-league-match-report\">Spurs had beaten Red Star 5-0</a>. Maybe I should stay away from White Hart Lane more often.</p> <h2><strong>Wednesday</strong></h2> <p>Boris Johnson has been in power for the best part of 100 days now, but today was only the second time he had to face prime minister\u2019s questions. It\u2019s not hard to see why he is so keen to avoid these set-pieces. What consistently strikes me is \u2013 for a man who comes self-billed as a star public performer \u2013 just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/23/not-even-boriss-narcissism-can-protect-him-as-cracks-show\">how bad he is at the big occasions</a> in parliament.</p> <p>The messed up hair, bumbling demeanour, Latin phrases, bad jokes and morse code delivery just don\u2019t cut it in the Commons. You can see that even some Tory MPs are beginning to wonder if they have staked everything on a dud. Johnson\u2019s lack of detail and the ease with which he lies are breathtaking. Borderline pathological.</p> <p>At one point in PMQs he managed in the same sentence to both insist that the UK was still going to leave the EU on 31 October and that Labour was blocking him from doing it. He also didn\u2019t appear to have a clue who his environment secretary was.</p> <p>That was possibly more excusable, though, as not even the dead-behind-the-eyes Theresa Villiers seems to know she is the environment secretary. Later in the afternoon, Johnson avoided further scrutiny when he scribbled a \u201cdog has eaten my homework\u201d note saying he couldn\u2019t be bothered to appear before the liaison committee. Taking back control clearly means the freedom to dispense with democratic accountability.</p> <h2><strong>Thursday</strong></h2> <p>Rather unexpectedly, I find I am rather loving the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rugby-world-cup\">rugby World Cup</a> in Japan.

      "bodyText": "Monday The only thing any of us can be certain about is that we will die. Most of us \u2013 myself included \u2013 only manage to cope with this knowledge by burying it deep into our subconscious and living each day as if we and those we love are immortal. I\u2019m much less of a hypochondriac than I was 20 years ago and I\u2019m still not sure if that is a sign of improved mental health or whether my levels of denial about the inevitability of death have dug in deeper. Rachel Clarke should be essential reading for all of us. A few years ago she wrote Your Life in My Hands, an account of her time as a junior doctor. Now she has written an even better book which I was lucky enough to receive as an advance copy. Dear Life is the story of her work as a palliative care doctor at a hospice in Oxford. It is in part a love letter both to her father, whose life and death she describes with great tenderness and unflinching directness, and her patients, but it is also a touching and profound meditation on what it means to be human. If it sounds depressing, it isn\u2019t. Rather it is uplifting. We can\u2019t all choose the manner of our death \u2013 some will be gentle, some violent, some quick, some prolonged \u2013 but we can choose how we live with that knowledge. As Clarke writes, the only difference between the dying and the rest of us is that the dying are aware just how little time they have left. It is the love that we choose to invest in each other despite the inevitability of the accompanying grief that really counts. It is a remarkable book. Pre-order it now. Tuesday There can\u2019t be many worse days to hold a book launch than on the night in half-term when the government chooses to hold votes both on the second reading and programme motion of its Brexit withdrawal bill and when Spurs are playing against Red Star Belgrade in the Champions League. At one point, I wasn\u2019t even sure I\u2019d be able to turn up to my own launch myself. I spent most of the day in a state of near panic worrying that there would be just me, the publisher and a few bemused stragglers who happened to be shopping in Daunt\u2019s bookshop in Marylebone for the party to celebrate the publication of my latest collection of sketches, Decline and Fail. When I wrote I, Maybot a couple of years ago, it never really occurred to me there would be a Brexit sequel. Now it\u2019s rather looking as if we are two books in to a trilogy. Or possibly a tetralogy. As it was, I was touched that so many friends turned up and the place was rammed, despite many lobby journalists and Spurs fans being otherwise engaged. Even I had to admit that it was a success, though it wasn\u2019t without its stresses as I had to dash off to a pub at the end to watch the two votes and subsequent points of order on playback so that I could complete the day\u2019s sketch. I then discovered that Spurs had beaten Red Star 5-0. Maybe I should stay away from White Hart Lane more often. Wednesday Boris Johnson has been in power for the best part of 100 days now, but today was only the second time he had to face prime minister\u2019s questions. It\u2019s not hard to see why he is so keen to avoid these set-pieces. What consistently strikes me is \u2013 for a man who comes self-billed as a star public performer \u2013 just how bad he is at the big occasions in parliament. The messed up hair, bumbling demeanour, Latin phrases, bad jokes and morse code delivery just don\u2019t cut it in the Commons. You can see that even some Tory MPs are beginning to wonder if they have staked everything on a dud. Johnson\u2019s lack of detail and the ease with which he lies are breathtaking. Borderline pathological. At one point in PMQs he managed in the same sentence to both insist that the UK was still going to leave the EU on 31 October and that Labour was blocking him from doing it. He also didn\u2019t appear to have a clue who his environment secretary was. That was possibly more excusable, though, as not even the dead-behind-the-eyes Theresa Villiers seems to know she is the environment secretary. Later in the afternoon, Johnson avoided further scrutiny when he scribbled a \u201cdog has eaten my homework\u201d note saying he couldn\u2019t be bothered to appear before the liaison committee. Taking back control clearly means the freedom to dispense with democratic accountability. Thursday Rather unexpectedly, I find I am rather loving the rugby World Cup in Japan. Largely because I have almost no interest in the sport, often have no idea exactly where the ball is or which side is in possession and only the most basic grasp of the rules. With football and cricket, my personal investment is so great that each match can only end in tragedy or triumph. Each game is an endurance test and I\u2019m a nervous wreck by the end of each competition or tournament. My relationship with rugby is far more healthy. I can want England to win, safe in the knowledge that if they do lose then I will be completely over it within a matter of minutes and can get on with the rest of my life. There will be no long period of celebration or mourning. No anguished post-mortems with friends on social media. This means that I can watch the games with much the same pleasure as I get from the new series of Spiral and the Anglo-Japanese thriller, Giri/Haji. Both of which I enjoy immensely, despite not always knowing precisely who everybody is or what exactly is going on. I\u2019m only four episodes into Spiral \u2013 Laure has to be one of the greatest TV cops and how long is Josephine going to spend in prison? \u2013 and two into Giri/Haji, so it\u2019s possible that all will become clearer by the season\u2019s end. Which is more than I can ever say for the rugby. Friday The prospect of another general election is doing nothing for my wellbeing. Not just because of the possible outcome \u2013 imagine Boris Johnson as prime minister for another five years \u2013 but because the five week campaign will entail me not knowing where I\u2019m going to be on any given day until late the night before at the very earliest, a lot of travel and the worry that I\u2019ve ended up in the wrong place because the best action has taken place elsewhere.

      "body": "<p>The TV voiceover is a trope that is as old as TV itself. It has been a staple of mystery shows, comedies and even heavyweight dramas.

Characters are no longer narrating to an imagined \u201cother\u201d, with audience members simply eavesdropping.

Mr Robot has let its protagonist, Elliot (Rami Malek), talk to us in voiceover since episode one. \u201cHello, friend,\u201d his soporific voice greets us, lulling us into a false sense of security that this is a garden-variety TV voiceover. But \u2013 as the show has gone on \u2013 Elliot has called on us more and more, asking us to help him search a room for clues, or berating us for withholding information from him.

As VR becomes a more viable platform, and interactive television like Bandersnatch becomes increasingly achievable, it is likely that we will only be drawn further and further into the stories we love. Despite growing TV audiences, things have never felt so personal. The final season of Mr Robot airs on Amazon Prime in the UK and USA Network in the US",

      "bodyText": "The UK government has considered options for repatriating British members of Islamic State being held in prison camps in northern Syria, it has emerged. The information was disclosed during the hearing into the home secretary\u2019s decision to remove the citizenship of Shamima Begum, the former Bethnal Green schoolgirl who travelled to Syria at the age of 15. It contradicts a previous assertion by the government that it has no way of getting British Isis fighters, their wives and children out of Syria. The government document, referred to at the tribunal, was dated 4 April 2019 and headed \u201coptions for extracting British nationals from Syrian IDP camps\u201d \u2013 a reference to internally displaced people. Tom Hickman QC, for Begum, said the document stated: \u201cWhile difficult, the practical challenges in arranging and implementing an extraction are likely to have solutions.\u201d Begum was already in the camp when she was deprived of her British citizenship, but her lawyer said there had been a \u201cforeseeable chance of her being repatriated\u201d. \u201cIf they hadn\u2019t taken her citizenship away, as time went on, pressure would build and build to repatriate, particularly where women and children are involved, to the UK,\u201d he told the Special Immigration and Appeals Commission (Siac). \u201cThere was a foreseeable chance of her being repatriated to the UK because that\u2019s stated in terms. We don\u2019t accept it was merely speculation.\u201d The Foreign Office minister Andrew Murrison repeated this week that \u201cthe UK has no consular presence in Syria from which to provide assistance\u201d. He has promised to \u201cdo all we can for unaccompanied minors and orphans\u201d, but that leaves children with parents in the camps in a legal limbo. This week a Human Rights Watch report said 30 British women and 60 British children were being detained by Kurdish authorities in north-east Syria. According to the report the children are all below the age of 12 and a significant majority are younger than five, with the vast majority detained with their mothers. Human Rights Watch said the Roj camp, where Begum is held, and the al-Hawl camp, where she was previously held, remained under the control of Kurdish authorities and outside the proposed Turkish buffer zone. The campaign group said there were no active hostilities between the Kurds and Turkey near these camps and the route out of north-east Syria to Iraq was still held by the Kurdish authority. Jonathan Glasson QC, for the home secretary, told the hearing of the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (Siac) that even if Begum succeeded in having her citizenship reinstated, her \u201cdetention will be unaffected\u201d. \u201cEven if her appeal succeeds it could not result in her return,\u201d he said. \u201cHer treatment is the same as British citizens who have not been deprived.\u201d Glasson said the government accepted that the situation in Syria was \u201cfluid and volatile\u201d and Begum could not give live evidence or make a witness statement. But he said that should not prevent the home secretary from removing her citizenship, adding: \u201cThe more committed and extreme an individual is, the more likely they would find themselves in a situation where they were less able to participate in proceedings and so less likely to be the subject of deprivation and that cannot possibly be right.\u201d Begum left Britain in February 2015 when she was 15, with two friends from the Bethnal Green academy in east London, using her older sister\u2019s passport. In Syria, Begum married an Isis fighter and the couple had three children, all of whom died of disease or malnutrition, the last in a prison camp in northern Syria. She was stripped of her British citizenship on the grounds of national security in February, amid a political row over whether she was a dual British and Bangladeshi citizen. But under UN conventions signed after the second world war, making a person stateless is unlawful. Now in the Roj camp, Begum has appealed to come home, saying: \u201cI hate the Dawla [Isis] so much.\u201d Hickman said the situation in the camp meant Begum had not been able to speak privately to her lawyers about what happened to her. \u201cWe do not know if she is one of the people who tried to run away from Isis or whether she would have done so if she could have done. We simply don\u2019t know any of these things,\u201d he added. The Siac hearing went into closed session before adjourning for judgment at a later date. \u2022 This article was amended on 26 October 2019. The original version incorrectly stated that Save the Children was looking after the children taken from the Ain Issa camp.",

Tim Farron, the Lib Dem MP for Westmorland and Lonsdale, said his Lakes constituency had been hit by three severe floods at this time of year in the past 15 years. The last, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/dec/08/storm-desmond-damage-cumbria-estimated-500m\">Storm Desmond</a>, left 3,000 families homeless and washed away the district\u2019s main road. \u201cI like elections but there is an enormous risk, given the time of year, that it could be disrupted,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In the 2016 EU referendum, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/23/torrential-rain-and-flooding-in-london-and-south-east-on-referendum-day\">flash floods closed polling stations and underground stations</a>, with commuters stranded at railway stations in London. Voters had to wade through flood waters to cast a vote.</p> <h2><strong>Postal votes</strong></h2> <p>Switching to postal votes may seem an obvious answer but a poll just before Christmas, organised at very short notice, presents particular challenges that rarely affect a prearranged spring or summer polls, said Laura Lock, deputy chief executive of the Association of Electoral Administrators (AEA).</p> <p>If MPs decide next week to have the poll on 12 December, councils will be rushing to get postal-vote envelopes printed, but the voting papers can only be printed once nominations close on 14 November. There are only a few firms that print voting papers for every council in the UK, and they will only allow a few print runs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"fc9d5493-e583-487b-a944-351a3fed08b6\"         data-atom-type=\"qanda\"    > </gu-atom> </figure>   <p>In the 2015 general election there were 7.6 million postal voters, but anyone who applies at the last moment for a new postal vote because of worries about the weather may not receive their papers in time. The registration deadline will be 26 November, but this election will hit the Christmas post. Lock said they have started talking to Royal Mail about prioritising postal ballot deliveries over normal Christmas mail. To complicate matters, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/15/christmas-postal-strike-looms-after-royal-mail-workers-vote-for-action\">postal workers are considering strike action</a> in December.</p> <p>Weather-related delays and reduced services for rural areas and islands would increase the risks of delay. Carmichael said he started nudging his constituents in far-flung islands to register for postal votes several weeks ago.</p> <p>Lock recommends postal voters living overseas consider nominating a proxy in the UK to vote for them since time will be so tight. \u201cWe might really struggle to get it to the other side of the world and back in that timescale,\u201d she said.</p> <h2>Venues</h2> <p>Councils across the UK are already struggling to find venues for polling stations and places to hold their main counts. The AEA has heard of councils finding all their normal polling stations and count venues booked up for Christmas pantomimes, festivals or office parties. In Birmingham, the major exhibition halls are booked for Christmas events.</p> <p>In smaller villages, in south Cambridgeshire, for example, the pubs that used to serve as polling stations are now closed so councils are looking to use caravans instead, which, said Lock, poses significant safety and access challenges. Councils need to know venues are properly lit, are accessible to wheelchair users, and that pavements or car parks are gritted against ice and snow. Warmth is also an issue: many village halls are ill-equipped to cope with mid-winter temperatures.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/25/jeremy-corbyn-says-election-so-close-to-christmas-really-odd\">Jeremy Corbyn says election so close to Christmas 'really odd'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Polling officers are often elderly and have to be on duty from 6.30am until 10.15pm.

My love for coaching has not for a moment been diluted, but I accept the report highlighted aspects of my coaching skills that could perhaps be improved. </p> <p>\u201cI have probably relied too much on my own life experiences playing under some of the best coaches in the world, rather than assessing the sensitivities of a new generation of players. </p> <p>\u201cMy only aim was to produce winners and if I upset any young players or their parents or if I was insensitive in any way towards their feelings, then that was never my intention.

My Granddad, who was a lifelong Kopite called around to my mams and asked if I was well enough to accompany him to Anfield for the Spurs game. Everton were playing Manchester United at Old Trafford and back in those dark days this was not a game a half-fit juvenile who couldn't run away or dodge the slings and arrows chucked by outrageous nobheads should attend. So, I went with him to Anfield.</p> <p>We popped into the Bluebell in Huyton and then into the FlatIron where he introduced me to a lifelong friend 'to keep the chill out' warm rum and blackcurrant. We entered the Kop, me slightly unsteady and made our way to the Kemlyn Road side where he'd stood each home game for the best part of 60 years, only interrupted by his service on the Arctic Convoys and being too skint to afford it during the Great Depression when he was laid off from the docks and blacklisted for union activities.</p> <p>What followed was the best team performance I've seen live, at any place, any time, anywhere. It was a complete evisceration and Spurs containing great players like Hoddle, Villa, Ardiles and Perryman were made to look like a pre-school toddler glee club who'd accidentally turned up at the Battle of the Little Big Horn with 'We hate Crazy Horse' stickers on their satchels.</p> <p>Many details of this game have faded into obscurity, time, hot rum and blacks and being hit on the head with chucked slings and arrows does that to you. However, one incident, a goal by Terry McDermott was as a result of a sublime piece of football. I remember turning to my granddad open mouthed with admiration and him saying to me with his hand cupped over my ear 'See what you're missing!'. I'd broken his heart 12 years previous when I'd opted to follow the Blue side of Merseyside after watching Alex Young diddle his way through half of the opposition each week and Alan Ball dominate nearly every game he played in. </p> <p>We left the game, went into The Farmers and more rum and blacks (you cant be too careful with flu) and I reflected on the exhibition of football played simple but at its finest. I didn't know it but after dodging strike breakers, the Luftwaffe and Kreigsmarine that Players Navy Cut was to catch up with my granddad before the year was out and it was to be the last game we'd ever attend together. </p> <p>I fear Spurs might be on the end of another shellacking tomorrow. Whatever the result I'll be lifting a glass of rum and black to the finest man I've ever known - he just had to be a bloody kopite</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5db2fea98f0898437061bf97\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-25T13:56:35.458Z\">2.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Aston Villa manager Dean Smith</strong> has a plan for dealing with Manchester City\u2019s Raheem Sterling on Saturday:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>He\u2019s an extraordinary player.

My Granddad, who was a lifelong Kopite called around to my mams and asked if I was well enough to accompany him to Anfield for the Spurs game. Everton were playing Manchester United at Old Trafford and back in those dark days this was not a game a half-fit juvenile who couldn't run away or dodge the slings and arrows chucked by outrageous nobheads should attend. So, I went with him to Anfield.</p> <p>We popped into the Bluebell in Huyton and then into the FlatIron where he introduced me to a lifelong friend 'to keep the chill out' warm rum and blackcurrant. We entered the Kop, me slightly unsteady and made our way to the Kemlyn Road side where he'd stood each home game for the best part of 60 years, only interrupted by his service on the Arctic Convoys and being too skint to afford it during the Great Depression when he was laid off from the docks and blacklisted for union activities.</p> <p>What followed was the best team performance I've seen live, at any place, any time, anywhere. It was a complete evisceration and Spurs containing great players like Hoddle, Villa, Ardiles and Perryman were made to look like a pre-school toddler glee club who'd accidentally turned up at the Battle of the Little Big Horn with 'We hate Crazy Horse' stickers on their satchels.</p> <p>Many details of this game have faded into obscurity, time, hot rum and blacks and being hit on the head with chucked slings and arrows does that to you. However, one incident, a goal by Terry McDermott was as a result of a sublime piece of football. I remember turning to my granddad open mouthed with admiration and him saying to me with his hand cupped over my ear 'See what you're missing!'. I'd broken his heart 12 years previous when I'd opted to follow the Blue side of Merseyside after watching Alex Young diddle his way through half of the opposition each week and Alan Ball dominate nearly every game he played in. </p> <p>We left the game, went into The Farmers and more rum and blacks (you cant be too careful with flu) and I reflected on the exhibition of football played simple but at its finest. I didn't know it but after dodging strike breakers, the Luftwaffe and Kreigsmarine that Players Navy Cut was to catch up with my granddad before the year was out and it was to be the last game we'd ever attend together. </p> <p>I fear Spurs might be on the end of another shellacking tomorrow. Whatever the result I'll be lifting a glass of rum and black to the finest man I've ever known - he just had to be a bloody kopite</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5db2c4b08f08142786c50d14\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-25T09:50:19.429Z\">10.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Harry Kane: 10 or 9? </strong>My colleague Tim de Lisle made this point after Spurs\u2019 last trip to Anfield, and it\u2019s becoming increasingly apparent that, for richer and poorer, Harry Kane has evolved as a player.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from me. I\u2019ll be live on the site from 7pm with hot MBM action of tonight\u2019s big game: Southampton v Leicester. Until then, have a read of Barney Ronay\u2019s column, which is here. You can find all your match previews for the weekend\u2019s Premier League games right here. Have a good weekend, folks. This is a good tweet. Interesting story coming out of France, Monaco look like they are going to turn their season-long loan for Islam Slimani permanent for around \u20ac10 million (\u00a38.7m). The Algerian has been in excellent form since his August move, six assists (although the Ligue 1 official website says seven) and five goals in just seven matches. Nobody in Ligue 1 has more assists. L\u2019Equipe claim that personal terms have already been arranged. Update: Jack Rodwell has now passed his medical and has undergone training at Roma. The club are now deciding whether to hand him a short-term deal, reportedly it will be either the Englishman or Marcel Buchel, another midfielder that most recently played at Empoli. Rodwell was good for Blackburn last season, although he played his best football at centre back. I struggle to see how he is going to keep up with the pace of Serie A football, particularly if he plays in midfield. Prior to Palace\u2019s game against Arsenal, Roy Hodgson has been talking about Wilfried Zaha, and how close he came/didn\u2019t come to joining the Gunners in the summer. Not very close at all as far as I know. I believe that the money that was offered which was widely reported [\u00a340m] was reasonably accurate, and of course that was way below our valuation. I thought he got over his disappointment very, very quickly and he has been good in both training and matches. I don\u2019t think the fact it is Arsenal will change his performance enormously - I would hope not, because I\u2019m expecting his performance to be very good against all the teams we play. Featuring 6ft7in Dan Burn at left back, ladies and gentlemen. Here\u2019s an update from the retrial of David Duckenfield on a charge of manslaughter. We will have something live on the website soon. This is a bizarre story. Gareth Barry, 38 years old, was released by West Brom in the summer and has since been a free agent. Now West Brom want him back, but because there was some sort of clause related to his loan spell from Everton to the Hawthorns in 2017, West Brom would now have to pay the Premier League club a small amount of money if they want to sign Barry again. This is the first deal of its kind that I\u2019ve heard of. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating for us and for him,\u201d West Brom head coach Slaven Bilic told BBC West Midlands. \u201cWe had a meeting yesterday. The deal is agreed with him but we have that situation with Everton. There is a little clause. I spoke to the board and we are doing everything we can. \u201cHe would be a major boost for us and one that comes from within too. He already knows the place and most of the players. We have a lot of young players. At times they need the kind of support that he can bring.\u201d That\u2019s for a friendly against Argentina, by the way, on Friday 15 November. Neymar hasn\u2019t been called up because of injury. He\u2019ll stay in Paris. There was some chat earlier about Villa\u2019s Douglas Luiz, and how Pep Guardiola thinks Man City still have a buy-back clause for the midfielder. Anyway, he\u2019s just been called up to the Brazil squad, alongside Real Madrid new boy Rodrygo. Douglas Luiz hasn\u2019t started for Villa in exactly a month. Does this mean John McGinn is good enough to play for Brazil? Some quotes have arrived, via PA, from Craig Bellamy (who is now a coach at Anderlecht under Vincent Kompany) following the conclusion of Cardiff\u2019s investigation into allegations of bullying and abuse against him and others. \u201cThe allegations of bullying and xenophobic behaviour made against me were difficult for me to come to terms with as I deplore bullying and any form of discrimination. I am not the subject of any disciplinary proceedings which, of course, comes as an immense relief to me. \u201cWhilst I have always categorically denied and disputed the allegations against me, the whole process was still very difficult to deal with and has resulted in a long period of self-reflection.\u201d PA understands no current academy coaches at Cardiff have lost their jobs in the wake of the investigation report\u2019s findings. Bellamy\u2019s statement highlighted Cardiff\u2019s investigation had \u201ccovered a lengthy period of time, including long periods when I was neither involved with the academy nor the club\u201d. The 40-year-old said he had \u201cco-operated at all times with the investigation and answered every question that was asked of me\u201d, adding he had \u201cvoluntarily removed\u201d himself from the Cardiff academy to allow the \u201cfull and robust investigation\u201d to be carried out. Bellamy added: \u201cAs a player and now as a coach, self-improvement was always my aim. My love for coaching has not for a moment been diluted, but I accept the report highlighted aspects of my coaching skills that could perhaps be improved. \u201cI have probably relied too much on my own life experiences playing under some of the best coaches in the world, rather than assessing the sensitivities of a new generation of players. \u201cMy only aim was to produce winners and if I upset any young players or their parents or if I was insensitive in any way towards their feelings, then that was never my intention. If I inadvertently offended anyone then I am truly sorry.\u201d The final few quotes are particularly interesting, and he got in a little dig about how modern players are soft. Not sure how sorry he really sounds. It\u2019s the Ruhr derby in Germany this weekend, between Schalke and Dortmund. The Bundesliga is probably Europe\u2019s most interesting league at the moment: Borussia Monchengladback lead Wolfsburg at the top of the table on goal difference, with Bayern and Dortmund a point behind in third and fourth. Schalke remain a point behind them, in seventh - there are just two points between the top nine teams. Dortmund slightly edge Schalke in the all-time Ruhr standings, 34 wins to 32. It is also the 50th anniversary of arguably the most famous derby the two sides have had, in 1969-70, when Schalke\u2019s Friedel Rausch was bitten on the arse by a police dog during a pitch invasion after Hans Pirkner had given Schalke the lead, which wasn\u2019t too popular with most of the 40,000 locals. You can also see Schalke\u2019s Gerd Neuser reeling (on the left) from a bite on the thigh. Also this snippet, from the Bundesliga: Several years later Rausch told Die Welt that he still has a scar from the bite and had to sleep on his stomach for two nights, but remarkably he carried on and completed the 90 minutes of a 1-1 draw \u2013 but only after receiving a tetanus jab from the team doctor. Rausch later received 500 Deutsche Mark (around $290) and a bouquet of flowers as an apology from Dortmund. The Dutch are here! Lock up your bicycles! An email, from Michael Gibson. Personally I might take Son over Bobby Firmino in a combined XI, but he\u2019s the only one, and that\u2019s really only because he\u2019s quicker across the ground so offers something else. Although I like Ndombele, I think a fully match fit Ox has the edge on him. Although whether Ox even gets in the team, despite doing so well on Weds evening, is another thing. On a related note, I just watched highlights of the 1978 Liverpool - Spurs match after reading the wonderfully evocative BTL piece by Sidfishes. Even though I didn\u2019t watch the whole game (would love to have been there though!), you can see King Kenny Dalglish\u2019s first thought every time is \u201ccan I score?\u201d. If he can\u2019t, he passes. It really, really, reminded me of Salah at the moment. I think we should lay off Mo, and let him get on with his game rather than castigate him for greediness. Yours, hoping for another 7-0 a la 1978! Here is that BTL piece Michael is talking about, and here are some highlights (the seventh goal is an absolute beauty, by the way). No gloves for the goalkeepers and a simple handshake for a celebration. Delightful. Aston Villa manager Dean Smith has a plan for dealing with Manchester City\u2019s Raheem Sterling on Saturday: He\u2019s an extraordinary player. I think he\u2019s proving that with club and country at the moment. We\u2019re looking at trying to tie his laces together. He\u2019s one that has to be stopped because he\u2019s been incredible over the last 12 months. What a challenge for our players to go and stop him and make him have a lesser performance than he he has done recently. In the Championship last season we were showing clips of Sterling and some runs that he makes to help improve our wide players and forwards. He\u2019s one who is up there as one of the best players in Europe at the moment. Was thinking earlier - one for the neutrals here perhaps - would you actually have any Spurs players at all in the Liverpool-Tottenham combined XI? I would prefer Firmino to Kane, Son would be a nice option off the bench (but probably doesn\u2019t beat any of the Reds\u2019 front three to a starting berth) and Joel Matip is having a better season than either of the Belgians at the back. The only one I might include in Tanguy Ndombele, he\u2019s a phenomenal talent and is just getting started. Answers - or any thoughts to be honest - to michael.butler@theguardian.com or tweet me @michaelbutler18. Hi everyone, and thanks to Luke. There certainly is some rugby going on. I\u2019ve booked an area in a local pub, and am planning to be on the tea and coffee (I\u2019ve got a 11-a-side game early afternoon) as the early morning Guinness is flying about. But anyway, we\u2019re here for football (mostly). Let\u2019s get on with that. And that\u2019s all from me today. Michael Butler will be along very shortly to edge you ever closer to the weekend\u2019s football, and that Super Massive Sunday meeting between Liverpool and Spurs. I think there is some rugby on too. Here is a story on the new injury problems for Pep Guardiola at Man City - Rodri and Zinchenko: Random, interesting Arsenal v Palace stat courtesy of the Premier League website: \u201cLuka Milivojevic has scored more Premier League goals against Arsenal than he has against any other side in the competition, netting four goals in five matches for the Eagles against Sunday\u2019s opponents.\u201d Personally, I think the always-entertaining Patrick Van Aanholt should stay on penalty duty. Yet more excellent Friday reading for you here. It\u2019s Ben Fisher on the south Wales derby - Swansea host Cardiff at 12.00 on Sunday in a super-massive Championship clash: Did we do the two Liverpool lads who accidentally got the train to Gent on Wednesday, instead of Genk, and hence missed the 4-1 win? Sky Sports News are building up to Sunday and Liverpool\u2019s encounter with Spurs. They are dubbing it not just a Super Sunday Clash, but a MASSIVE Super Sunday Clash. Reds boss Klopp has just been asked if he thinks the All Blacks will target England\u2019s line-out with George Kruis on the bench. He hasn\u2019t really. But here is Klopp on Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain\u2019s double against Genk a couple of days back: \u201cIt\u2019s no secret how much I like \u2018Ox\u2019 as a person, and a player...the goals were incredible, the second, I\u2019ve not seen one like this for a long, long, long time, if ever. The first one is what Ox is able to do, the unexpected shot. My expectations on him are high, the goals were good, but there is more to come. He knows that, I know that, all good.\u201d Man City defender Oleksandr Zinchenko is going to be out for \u2018four or five weeks\u2019 after minor knee surgery. Rodri, who hobbled out of Tuesday\u2019s Champions League clash with Atalanta, also had a hamstring problem and will be out for the next few weeks. Also asked \u2018what John Stones needs to do to become first-choice,\u2019 Guardiola added: \u201cIt\u2019s not about the first choice, it\u2019s about being fit. He has had many injuries. That\u2019s why he couldn\u2019t play.\u201d \u201cSometimes life is like this,\u201d philosophises Pep, with regard to Douglas Luiz, now at Aston Villa: Oh, a lot of quotes from Norwich boss Daniel Farke are on the Norwich website, which is nice. Here are a few ahead of their meeting with Manchester United : \u201cWe created a magic night against Man City. We can\u2019t take it as a given to repeat that on a weekly basis but we are trying to be outstanding with our performances. The atmosphere has to be like a cup game, a do or die game. \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be switched on because they\u2019re not where they want to be in the league. I expect it to be unbelievably difficult, regardless of what formation they use. If someone makes a successful tackle the whole stadium has to be buzzing. We need that mood or we have no chance.\u201d \u201cDe Gea is a world class keeper, rested just for this game! Maguire is one of the best centre backs in the world. Pogba one of the best holding midfielders. Martial, Rashford, James, Lingard... so many good options and top class players. We\u2019re not naive about that.\u201d Roy Hodgson is asked how close Crystal Palace\u2019s Wilfried Zaha was to signing for Arsenal in the summer: \u201cNot very far at all, as far as I know, the money that was offered was way below our valuation.\u201d Will Zaha go there with a point to prove? \u201cI hope not,\u201d Hodgson says. \u201cI expect him to want to perform against all the teams we play.\u201d Thanks to Kristof K\u00fcnssler-McIlwain, who emails from Berlin about the Man City/Hacienda kit story: \u201cAs much as I adore the idea of honouring a city\u2019s culture, I think it actually really does suck that Puma and the club didn\u2019t contact/include the original creators, where they clearly benefit from their work. There\u2019s a MixMag interview with the designer responsible for the [Manchester City] Hacienda kit, and it sounds a bit lame, considering it wouldn\u2019t be much of a hassle to actually reach these people mentioned. I mean, New Order are still a band and do use communication devices I suppose.\u201d Extract from the interview in question: \u201cDid you speak with anyone involved in The Ha\u00e7ienda, Factory Records or New Order at any point during the process? We couldn\u2019t! Because it was a secret that we signed with Manchester City until earlier this year so we couldn\u2019t talk to anyone outside Puma or the club. Unfortunately we couldn\u2019t get in touch with anyone who was working back then at The Hacienda, Factory Records or New Order, although I would have loved to.\u201d ... in that passive-aggressive way of his. Asked what has impressed him about promoted Aston Villa so far this season, he says: \u201cTeam spirit...quality up front... they are getting good results, and it looks like they have a good environment in the team.\u201d Then, asked how he has helped Raheem Sterling reach his current level, he adds: \u201cI didn\u2019t help him. The credit is all for Raheem.\u201d Courtesy of the wires, here\u2019s an update from that Norwich City press conference, ahead of their meeting with Manchester United: Centre-back Ben Godfrey, who had hernia surgery over the international break, went off early in the second half of the goalless draw at Bournemouth, but is expected to feature. Winger Onel Hernandez should also be involved despite some knee pain. Goalkeeper Ralf Fahrmann (groin) and midfielder Mario Vrancic (calf) plus defenders Christoph Zimmermann (foot), Timm Klose (knee) and Grant Hanley (groin) all continue their own rehabilitation. Meanwhile, the Southampton boss is clearly no Saint. He wants his team to get down and dirty against Leicester tonight. Ralph Hassenhuttl: \u201cThe time has come for, I call it, dirty wins \u2026 make this goal, and then defend with every you have, make it as nasty as possible for the opponent to get something here. The players know what it\u2019s about. We have to make it as hard as possible for our opponents. We\u2019re going at this game with all we have.\u201d Leicester head to Southampton tonight. Here is Foxes boss Brendan Rodgers on the game that people are already calling #SOULEI: \u201cWe\u2019ve shown resilience, quality, creativity \u2026 for me the nice thing in all this is we can be better and improve. We were happy with three points against Burnley but there are lots of elements that can be better. We play a tough team \u2026 but we\u2019ve relished every challenge that we\u2019ve had, we\u2019re looking forward to this game, and hopefully we\u2019ll collect another three points.\u201d No quotes to speak of from Daniel Farke at Norwich yet. Man City and Pep Guardiola at 1.30pm. From the generic Friday afternoon football quotes dept., courtesy Chelsea boss Lampard, who takes his side to Burnley. \u201cNever an easy game ... we respect our opponents ... we will focus on their threats.\u201d Press conferences coming thick and fast now. Palace boss Roy Hodgson says Vicente Guaita and Martin Kelly both trained today, and that he will make a \u2018late call\u2019 on their ability to face the Gunners: Rudiger, Kante, Christensen, Barkley are all sidelined for Chelsea\u2019s trip to Burnley tomorrow: I\u2019m now launching a new, almost certainly one-off, feature for the Friday blog - Kit Corner. Firstly, Liverpool have won a high court battle against New Balance. The honourable Justice Teare said the club are entitled to end the New Balance deal and switch to Nike as of next season, basically because the Nike deal is better and contractually/legally speaking, Liverpool are within their rights to take it: Secondly, a story about Manchester City, who have been criticised by designer Ben Kelly, who says their Hacienda-themed jersey is \u2018beyond appropriation\u2019. \u201cUltimately, I can\u2019t copyright stripes. I would be a very rich man if I could,\u201d said Kelly. \u201cIn the Champions League it was important to get three points, and not only because of three points, but to build our confidence again, start to build confidence. We are happy with that but we know it\u2019s only a small step.\u201d With regards to the slap-up meal the players\u2019 treated him and the staff to this week, to show support for the management team: \u201cIt was very nice, very kind from them to invite all the staff ... we spent a few hours there, it was nice to spend a few hours together, and to spend time in a different environment helps to build a positive dynamic. Arsenal striker Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9 banged in a couple of late free-kicks last night to see off the challenge of Vit\u00f3ria Guimar\u00e3es. He tells Nick Ames that he\u2019s struggled to adapt to life in the Premier League: Apropos of, well, football, did you see that Dulwich Hamlet are LIVE on telly in a couple of weeks\u2019 time? They\u2019re at home to Carlisle United in the FA Cup 1st Round on Friday 8th November, live on BBC2. That is going to be a cracking night at Champion Hill and will be well worth watching. A touch of team news from Tottenham. Lloris is still out after that dislocated elbow a couple of weeks back, but that is their only injury worry: Here\u2019s a fun little skills compilation with a bass-heavy soundtrack from Premier League Instagram: Good stat from Sky: Liverpool have a 77% win rate since the Champions League final in June. Spurs just 31%. Klopp was asked why Spurs haven\u2019t been able to kick on in the same way. \u201cI haven\u2019t thought about it, I can\u2019t comment on the situation at Spurs,\u201d he answers, predictably and entirely fairly. \u201cSpurs\u2019 situation, I cannot judge...Football is like this. They have not forgot how to play football, Harry Kane, Son, Alli, Eriksen, you cannot understand it from outside but they can play a proper performance. We won CL final, it was respectful night.\u201d Injury update from the Anfield gaffer: \u201cAndrew Robertson, we just rested him [he came off after 60 minutes on Wednesday] ... Trent [Alexander-Arnold] is fine, he looked fine, if there is no setback. He was ill enough to not travel with us, which is not a good sign, but he had a \u2018clearing\u2019 session yesterday, he should be fine. Shaq [Xherdan Shaqiri] needs a bit longer ... big muscles need a bit longer to heal.\u201d Also, Liverpool will need to check on the fitness of Joel Matip, who has been sidelined with a sore knee, but may still be fit to take on the Tottenham. How much of a selection headache has Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain given Klopp after his two goals in Genk? \u201cNone. It\u2019s just nice.\u201d And as for last weekend: \u201cThe impact Adam Lallana had against Manchester United was really pleasing. A lot of subs have made a big impact for us recently.\u201d \u201cWhen we got our yellow cards all the crowd started chanting \u2018equal pay\u2019.\u201d Read Suzanne Wrack\u2019s story about how the USA women\u2019s team inspired a school team in Burlington, Vermont, to take up the Equal Pay fight: Who could forget the day, exactly two years ago, when Antonio R\u00fcdiger scored his first goal for Chelsea? You? Me too. Here it is anyway: A Steve Bruce quote, on those Newcastle injuries: \u201cAndy Carroll picked up a groin strain last Saturday, and \u2018Fab\u2019 Schar has a sore knee which he\u2019s been playing with for the last few weeks...We expect them not to be long-term, which is good news.\u201d \u2018Fab\u2019 news, Steve. Meanwhile, Spurs and Norwich press conferences are due to start at 12.30pm. Sky Sports News just teed up Crystal Palace\u2019s press conference which will be coming up at 1pm. The Eagles face Arsenal in the \u2018Ian Wright derby\u2019 on Sunday afternoon. Stay tuned. Sheffield United and boss Chris Wilder are coming off the back of that memorable 1-0 victory against Arsenal on Monday night. Looking ahead to the Blades\u2019 visit to fortress London Stadium tomorrow, to face West Ham, Wilder said: \u201cTheir team is full of quality in every department ... We need to go again, and stick to the levels we\u2019ve shown so far, away from home especially.\u201d On the fitness front, there are no fresh injury concerns for Wilder. Good afternoon, sports fans. Excitement is mounting with a plethora of Premier League press conferences looming in the next couple of hours. News from Spurs, Norwich, Chelsea, Man City and more coming up. That\u2019s all from me, but Luke McLaughlin is waiting eagerly to be tagged in. Thanks for your company, bye! The weekend has landed It\u2019s hard to convey the joy that any self- loat respecting Guardian sports journalist derives from uploading the first squad sheet, the weekly reminderl that good times are only a few hours away. Here\u2019s Eddie Howe on Bournemouth\u2019s trip to Watford We know the start they have had, but I think it in no way reflects on their quality. They have got very good players and an outstanding manager, so we know it is going to be a tough game. If we went there focusing on their league position, it would be totally the wrong way to prepare for this game. For me, it is a key game. The league is so tight. Fantasy Football With absolutely nothing happening on the news wires, I\u2019ve set up a Fantasy Football league for those who frequent the Friday blog. It starts this week, so points are backdated, and I\u2019m currently top by virtue of having the only team in the league. Here\u2019s the link, and the code is nsid5w. Thirty one years ago last June, Euro 88 happened. Newcastle v Wolves squad news Andy Carroll and Fabian Schar are out of Newcastle\u2019s Premier League clash with Wolves on Sunday through injury. Striker Carroll suffered a groin strain during last Saturday\u2019s 1-0 defeat at Chelsea after coming on as a second-half substitute, while defender Schar has been struggling with a knee problem for some time, although neither is expected to be sidelined for too long. Isaac Hayden completes a three-match ban, but fellow midfielder Matt Ritchie is back in training after recovering from a nasty ankle injury sustained in a challenge by Leicester\u2019s Hamza Choudhury in August, while defender Florian Lejeune is also closing in on a return from knee ligament damage. Ryan Bennett is expected to sit out for Wolves. The defender missed the 2-1 win at Slovan Bratislava on Thursday after injuring his groin against Southampton last weekend. Forward Pedro Neto (hamstring) remains sidelined for Nuno Espirito Santo\u2019s side and defender Jesus Vallejo could return to the squad after being left out of the 18 in Slovakia while midfielder Ruben Neves may be recalled. Newcastle provisional squad Dubravka, Darlow, Manquillo, Krafth, Yedlin, Dummett, Willems, Lascelles, Fernandez, Clark, S. Longstaff, Shelvey, Ki, M. Longstaff, Atsu, Almiron, Joelinton, Muto, Gayle. Wolves provisional squad Patricio, Ruddy, Boly, Coady, Kilman, Vallejo, Doherty, Jonny, Moutinho, Vinagre, Dendoncker, Campbell, Perry, Saiss, Neves, Gibbs-White, Traore, Cutrone, Jota, Jimenez. Watford v Bournemouth squad news Watford will be missing forward Danny Welbeck and full-back Jose Holebas for Saturday\u2019s Premier League home match with Bournemouth. Welbeck suffered a serious hamstring injury early on against Tottenham while Holebas received his fifth yellow card, so must serve a one-match ban. Defender Daryl Janmaat is expected to feature after being substituted at Spurs, while Sebastian Prodl, Etienne Capoue and Isaac Success are all back in first-team training. Captain Troy Deeney is recovering from knee surgery. Bournemouth expect to have Colombia midfielder Jefferson Lerma available again following a hip problem suffered on international duty. Wales midfielder David Brooks is stepping up his recovery from a pre-season ankle injury. Winger Junior Stanislas (knee) and midfielder Dan Gosling (hip) both continue their own rehabilitation. Watford provisional squad Foster, Dawson, Mariappa, Prodl, Kiko, Foulquier, Cleverley, Doucoure, Hughes, Capoue, Deulofeu, Gomes, Janmaat, Cathcart, Kabasele, Chalobah, Sarr, Pereyra, Gray, Success. Bournemouth provisional squad Ramsdale, S Cook, Ake, A Smith, Rico, Lerma, L Cook, H Wilson, Fraser, King, C Wilson, Boruc, Francis, Kelly, Mepham, Surman, Billing, Solanke, Groeneveld. Another piece that looks well worth reading. What\u2019s going on at Guardian Towers today? Walter Cronkite department \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Drew Gough. \u201cI\u2019m Canadian, and apologize for that. It\u2019s a thing we do. Another thing we do is have really weird sports leagues, such as the seven-team Canadian Premier League, a story about which you linked to earlier. \u201cCanada also has an imitation of the NFL called the CFL, or Canadian Football League. It has nine teams. When I was a kid, I think it only had eight teams, and two of those teams - one from Ottawa (a city) and the other from Saskatchewan (a vast, wheat-filled province) - were both called the Roughriders. Okay, to be fair, one was called the Rough Riders and the other the Roughriders, but it always made me deeply ashamed to be from a country with such little creativity. \u201cThe Ottawa Rough Riders folded for a while, and have now come back with a much more creative name: the Ottawa Redblacks, which doubles as a handy description of their uniform colour. Again, so sorry. Cheers!\u201d What are you apologising for? This all sounds great to me. I\u2019d love to Liverpool FC (managed by Jurgen Klopp) play Liver Pool FC (managed by Phil Brown). This is great Harry Kane: 10 or 9? My colleague Tim de Lisle made this point after Spurs\u2019 last trip to Anfield, and it\u2019s becoming increasingly apparent that, for richer and poorer, Harry Kane has evolved as a player. Even though he\u2019s a much more impressive all-round footballer now, I still I think I preferred the netbusting beast of 2016-18. Watford v Bournemouth The Watford coach Quique Sanchez Flores is happy with his team\u2019s performances in their last two games, even though they remain winless. We were very solid, we didn\u2019t concede space, we took the ball with clever ideas and we tried to use our tools and I can see something different. Against Sheffield, I can see something similar to what I want and against Tottenham we confirm this. For the next matches, what we need to do is confirm all these type of things. The Miracle of Burnley I haven\u2019t read this yet, as it only landed two minutes ago, but this looks like an excellent piece. A bit of Newcastle team news from the wires Newcastle will be without Andy Carroll and Fabian Schar for Sunday\u2019s Premier League clash with Wolves. Head coach Steve Bruce has revealed injury-plagued striker Carroll is out with a groin strain, while central defender Schar has a knee problem, although neither is expected to be missing for much longer. He said: \u201cThey are not serious at all. Andy unfortunately picked up a groin strain last Saturday, and Fab Schar\u2019s had a bit of a sore knee, which he\u2019s been playing with for the last two or three weeks. Last Saturday it became too uncomfortable for him. \u201cThey\u2019ll both miss tomorrow. They could be in contention for midweek. We expect them not to be long term, which is good news.\u201d Carroll is yet to start a game after returning to his first club from West Ham during the summer, but has made four appearances as a substitute as his comeback from ankle surgery is carefully managed. Bruce said: \u201cLook, it\u2019s not his ankle, thankfully, it\u2019s not his ankle. Everybody can pick up those type of niggles, especially when you\u2019re sitting on a bench for a while. \u201cHe\u2019s come on and stretched for one and and over-stretched. It\u2019s one of those things. It\u2019s fortunate, as I said, that his ankle is good and the way we are managing his ankle is good news. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing and there\u2019s nobody more disappointed than Andy, of course, but these things happen.\u201d And here\u2019s Jamie Jackson\u2019s follow-up from United\u2019s victory in Belgrade. It looks like Manchester United will stick with their 3-4-1-2 system for a while. And why not? Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has been talking about Norwich ahead of Manchester United\u2019s trip to Carrow Road. When I watched the first game against Liverpool, I saw a team with lots of courage. They were brave, they played their own way and they kept going. And that has given them some great results, when they beat Newcastle, when they beat Manchester City. They are a team with a clear philosophy on how they want to play. So, I hope we\u2019re going to stop them, because it\u2019s always going to be difficult down at Carrow Road, but we\u2019re ready for it now. We\u2019ve been to Belgrade, got some players back. I managed to take Aaron (Wan-Bissaka) and Anthony off after 60 minutes because they\u2019ve been out for a long time. So, hopefully we\u2019ll have a fresh team because we need to be at our best to have a chance. It\u2019s Liverpool v Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday, so it\u2019s only fair that we dig out this superb Joy of Six from Scott Murray. And yes, it does include that Terry McDermott goal. Serie A Here\u2019s more on Jack Rodwell\u2019s unlikely move to AS Roma. This has very little to do with the Premier League but it\u2019s well worth reading. Brighton v Everton squad news Brighton will be without midfielder Aaron Mooy through suspension for the Premier League match against Everton. Seagulls boss Graham Potter reported no other fresh selection concerns following the defeat at Aston Villa, where Mooy was sent off. Defender Bernardo and winger Jose Izquierdo remain sidelined by their respective knee problems. Everton defender Yerry Mina is a doubt for the trip as the Colombia international battles a knee injury. Mina, who was substituted in the final minutes of last weekend\u2019s 2-0 win over West Ham, has not been able to train with his team-mates during the week, with Mason Holgate ready to step in if required. Captain Seamus Coleman returns from suspension, while midfielders Fabian Delph and Morgan Schneiderlin are fit again after minor injuries. Brighton provisional squad Ryan, Dunk, Webster, Montoya, Burn, Stephens, Gross, March, Propper, Maupay, Connolly, Button, Duffy, Bong, Bissouma, Trossard, Murray, Alzate. Everton provisional squad Pickford, Lossl, Mina, Keane, Coleman, Holgate, Digne, Baines, Sidibe, Gomes, Schneiderlin, Delph, Davies, Walcott, Sigurdsson, Bernard, Iwobi, Calvert-Lewin, Kean, Richarlison, Stekelenburg. Let\u2019s start with some transfer rumours. If I may speak frankly, most of them are recycled, but we are beholden to other forces. If other websites don\u2019t invent gossip, we can\u2019t possibly report it. Hello and welcome to our occasionally singing, sporadically dancing Premier League preview blog. This weekend\u2019s fixture list is not, truth be telt, the most exciting season, and the Rugby World Cup may overshadow it. But these 10 games of football will shape the mood of billions, and you can\u2019t say that about many forms of popular entertainment. Here\u2019s a full list of the weekend\u2019s fixtures. Friday Southampton v Leicester (8pm) Saturday (3pm BST unless stated) Manchester City v Aston Villa (12.30pm) Brighton &amp; Hove Albion v Everton Watford v Bournemouth West Ham v Sheffield United Burnley v Chelsea (5.30pm) Sunday Newcastle v Wolves (2pm) Arsenal v Crystal Palace (4.30pm) Liverpool v Tottenham Hotspur (4.30pm) Norwich v Manchester United (4.30pm) We\u2019ll have updates throughout the day, including injury news, press conference tidbits and the rest. In the meantime, our crack team of writers have picked 10 things to look out for this weekend.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cWhom the gods wish to destroy they first call promising.\u201d Good news, then, for Jadon Sancho, who seems at every step of his footballing life to have skipped the age of promise and gone straight on to the role of luminous, fully realised talent.</p> <p>The kind of promise Cyril Connolly\u2019s famous dictum had in mind was fragile literary talent, specifically his own crushing failure, despite having, like, done really well at Eton, to write a literary classic \u2026 a failure Connolly later turned to success, with a very English sense of charm-laden irony, by writing about it at great length in Enemies of Promise.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/11/borussia-dortmund-jadon-sancho-tottenham-champions-league-interview\">Jadon Sancho: \u2018It hasn\u2019t been easy. I\u2019ve had to work for this\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With this in mind it seems likely Sancho will not have to worry much about Connolly\u2019s main Enemies. The pram in the hall is not really an issue when the hall is a marbled ante-chamber staffed with basking trophy nannies.</p> <p>Similarly the urge to take on hack journalism work is unlikely to become a distraction, tempting though it must be for young Jadon as he glances up at the haggard, gimlet-eyed human material of the press box. As for the negative effects of earning too much money too young, well, that is pretty much the whole point around here.</p> <p>Football and promise: it has become a violently altered landscape in recent times; and a relationship Sancho understands, as an insider, as well as anyone else.</p> <p>Promise is a hard commodity now. It comes with a set of numbers attached.</p> <p>Promise can be worth more than tangible achievement, the ability to convince one of Europe\u2019s superclubs you might <em>become</em> a great footballer of greater life-changing value than actually <em>being</em> a great footballer, a principle otherwise known as the Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 Paradox. In that sense Sancho is already there, or almost there. Almost being the key point, as far as Borussia Dortmund are concerned. It is worth keeping this in mind as the most promising of England\u2019s current crop of teenage footballers hits his first little note of turbulence.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e28ea0a90a034dc5ba93f80878d323857e89bef0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e28ea0a90a034dc5ba93f80878d323857e89bef0/0_0_3500_2399/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sancho comes out for the warm up before England\u2019s match in Sofia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"685\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sancho comes out for the warm up before England\u2019s match in Sofia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl Recine/Action Images via Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sancho played as well as anyone in Dortmund\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/23/champions-league-messi-barcelona-valencia-lyon\" title=\"\">defeat against Internazionale</a> in Milan on Wednesday. More significantly he was dropped for the big game with Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach last weekend after returning late from England duty, a punishment that came with a fine and a public slap down from Michael Zorc, the sporting director.</p> <p>There has been some vague talk since of other incidents, of Sancho needing to be reined in, grounded, paternally realigned. It feels like a story we have heard before. Youth, talent, fame, the empowered teenager. The sage but stern Bundesliga overlord.</p> <p>Or perhaps not. Sancho is 19. On the Monday he was part of an England team <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/14/bulgaria-england-euro-2020-qualifying-match-report\" title=\"\">racially abused in Sofia</a>, a traumatic experience even for those watching from the sidelines. He came back late and missed training.</p> <p>By Saturday he was being publicly called out by his manager and then by the club. The same Sancho who rushed back after his grandmother\u2019s death last year, refused the offer of a rest, scored in the derby and was praised unconditionally for his above-and-beyond mentality. Does this seem fair and reasonable? Is it meant to?</p> <p>But then the idea of Dortmund as a kind of safe space, all soft edges and warm milk, Charles Xavier\u2019s school for gifted youths, has always been a slight stretch. This is a clearing house based on glossing and selling promise. A sustained spell of form from a retail-friendly teenager: this is everything, this is the business plan. Zorc may be a serious football operator, appearing in public with an air of handsomely styled destiny about him, like a four-star general in charge of the human response to the alien fleet invasion. But he is also a salesman and like any good salesman he is always, always closing.</p> <p>And now he is talking about Sancho, for obvious reasons. Dortmund have made \u00a3400m over 10 years just from selling players to Barcelona, Arsenal, Bayern Munich, Manchester United, Chelsea and PSG. Sancho is the next dividend. He has at most a single season left to run. But this needs to be done right and there have been some problems.</p> <p>\u201cSancho reminds me of Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9,\u201d Zorc has said. And why not plug that sales line? The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/aug/25/barcelona-sign-ousmane-dembele-borussia-dortmund\" title=\"\">Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 deal</a> was a one-man five-year profit margin, success so brilliant it was almost too much, enough to knock the whole process out of whack. Demb\u00e9l\u00e9\u2019s problems at Barcelona have been a blemish on the record, a reputation issue, a reminder, if you look closely, that very few of these refined, BVB-issue youngsters have gone on to flourish unconditionally.</p> <p>Sancho has been better than Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 at Dortmund, has scored more goals, made more goals and done it two years younger. But he has been overplayed too, in a way that goes outside the finishing school narrative, first in the hope Dortmund might have won the league and now by a manager under pressure.</p> <p>Sancho played more games than Wayne Rooney at the same age. Sancho played more games than Lionel Messi in his equivalent season \u2013 and Messi, the genius-level 18-year-old was a genuine face-melting Ark of the Covenant temptation. Just before his late return from England duty Sancho had played 10 games in five weeks, the last of which ended with him on the wing close to midnight being abused by tinpot black shirts.</p> <p>This is a teenager pushed until he makes a mistake, then solemnly disciplined by corporate handlers with a heavy commercial investment in his success. At the end of which he still holds the cards. Sancho would be a transformative signing for Manchester United. He would be perfect as another ravenous high-grade component in the Liverpool frontline. Monetising promise.

      "bodyText": "\u201cWhom the gods wish to destroy they first call promising.\u201d Good news, then, for Jadon Sancho, who seems at every step of his footballing life to have skipped the age of promise and gone straight on to the role of luminous, fully realised talent. The kind of promise Cyril Connolly\u2019s famous dictum had in mind was fragile literary talent, specifically his own crushing failure, despite having, like, done really well at Eton, to write a literary classic \u2026 a failure Connolly later turned to success, with a very English sense of charm-laden irony, by writing about it at great length in Enemies of Promise. With this in mind it seems likely Sancho will not have to worry much about Connolly\u2019s main Enemies. The pram in the hall is not really an issue when the hall is a marbled ante-chamber staffed with basking trophy nannies. Similarly the urge to take on hack journalism work is unlikely to become a distraction, tempting though it must be for young Jadon as he glances up at the haggard, gimlet-eyed human material of the press box. As for the negative effects of earning too much money too young, well, that is pretty much the whole point around here. Football and promise: it has become a violently altered landscape in recent times; and a relationship Sancho understands, as an insider, as well as anyone else. Promise is a hard commodity now. It comes with a set of numbers attached. Promise can be worth more than tangible achievement, the ability to convince one of Europe\u2019s superclubs you might become a great footballer of greater life-changing value than actually being a great footballer, a principle otherwise known as the Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 Paradox. In that sense Sancho is already there, or almost there. Almost being the key point, as far as Borussia Dortmund are concerned. It is worth keeping this in mind as the most promising of England\u2019s current crop of teenage footballers hits his first little note of turbulence. Sancho played as well as anyone in Dortmund\u2019s defeat against Internazionale in Milan on Wednesday. More significantly he was dropped for the big game with Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach last weekend after returning late from England duty, a punishment that came with a fine and a public slap down from Michael Zorc, the sporting director. There has been some vague talk since of other incidents, of Sancho needing to be reined in, grounded, paternally realigned. It feels like a story we have heard before. Youth, talent, fame, the empowered teenager. The sage but stern Bundesliga overlord. Or perhaps not. Sancho is 19. On the Monday he was part of an England team racially abused in Sofia, a traumatic experience even for those watching from the sidelines. He came back late and missed training. By Saturday he was being publicly called out by his manager and then by the club. The same Sancho who rushed back after his grandmother\u2019s death last year, refused the offer of a rest, scored in the derby and was praised unconditionally for his above-and-beyond mentality. Does this seem fair and reasonable? Is it meant to? But then the idea of Dortmund as a kind of safe space, all soft edges and warm milk, Charles Xavier\u2019s school for gifted youths, has always been a slight stretch. This is a clearing house based on glossing and selling promise. A sustained spell of form from a retail-friendly teenager: this is everything, this is the business plan. Zorc may be a serious football operator, appearing in public with an air of handsomely styled destiny about him, like a four-star general in charge of the human response to the alien fleet invasion. But he is also a salesman and like any good salesman he is always, always closing. And now he is talking about Sancho, for obvious reasons. Dortmund have made \u00a3400m over 10 years just from selling players to Barcelona, Arsenal, Bayern Munich, Manchester United, Chelsea and PSG. Sancho is the next dividend. He has at most a single season left to run. But this needs to be done right and there have been some problems. \u201cSancho reminds me of Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9,\u201d Zorc has said. And why not plug that sales line? The Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 deal was a one-man five-year profit margin, success so brilliant it was almost too much, enough to knock the whole process out of whack. Demb\u00e9l\u00e9\u2019s problems at Barcelona have been a blemish on the record, a reputation issue, a reminder, if you look closely, that very few of these refined, BVB-issue youngsters have gone on to flourish unconditionally. Sancho has been better than Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 at Dortmund, has scored more goals, made more goals and done it two years younger. But he has been overplayed too, in a way that goes outside the finishing school narrative, first in the hope Dortmund might have won the league and now by a manager under pressure. Sancho played more games than Wayne Rooney at the same age. Sancho played more games than Lionel Messi in his equivalent season \u2013 and Messi, the genius-level 18-year-old was a genuine face-melting Ark of the Covenant temptation. Just before his late return from England duty Sancho had played 10 games in five weeks, the last of which ended with him on the wing close to midnight being abused by tinpot black shirts. This is a teenager pushed until he makes a mistake, then solemnly disciplined by corporate handlers with a heavy commercial investment in his success. At the end of which he still holds the cards. Sancho would be a transformative signing for Manchester United. He would be perfect as another ravenous high-grade component in the Liverpool frontline. Monetising promise. This is the game now; a game Sancho is, for all the noise, still best-placed to win.",

      "bodyText": "George Reynolds (The war on vegans, the long read, 25 October) conflates eating less meat, being vegetarian and being vegan. When he says \u201cVeganism, of course, is rooted in social justice\u201d, it is likely that phrase should apply to vegetarianism. At root, vegetarianism poses philosophical and moral issues. We are, by nature and evolution, fitted to a mixed diet, but at scale have a cruel and brutal way of putting meat on the table. Many people don\u2019t like being reminded of this. It makes them uncomfortable, and they take it out on the messenger. But there is something more going on, and that is specifically about veganism. George\u2019s article contains much of the answer to his question. He points out veganism \u201cis replacing one kind of industrialised system with another\u201d and that \u201cintensive industrialised farming of soya, maize and grains comes at a significant carbon cost, too \u2013 as does flying in the ingredients to keep berries and nut butters on a\u00e7a\u00ed bowls or avocado on toast\u201d.

Many charities have stopped providing homecare as we can\u2019t use charitable funds to prop up a failing system. Local authorities are strapped for cash, and still waiting for a social care bill. But most tragic of all is the person who needs that care and support, who is caught in a debate around funding, time and quality. Their quality of life is now measured in minutes of chargeable care. Because this happens in people\u2019s own homes we don\u2019t see it, debate it, or resolve it. Reminder \u2013 we are the fifth richest country in the world. Is this really how we want society to be?

There was full agreement to reach a unanimous, consensual EU27 decision. And there was full agreement to aim to take the decision by written procedure \u2026 Work will continue over the weekend.\u201d</p> <p>The diplomatic source added that EU27 diplomats were \u201cexpected to meet early next week to finalise an agreement\u201d and that the president of the European council, Donald Tusk, had \u201cno intention\u201d of calling a summit.</p> <p>A majority of member states want to accept the terms of an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/19/eu-will-grant-brexit-extension-if-johnson-sends-letter-says-brussels\">extension reluctantly requested by Johnson</a>, under which Brexit could be delayed until 31 January, but with the opportunity to leave earlier if the withdrawal agreement was ratified in Westminster and by the European parliament.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"1bf746b1-27c2-48bd-b882-a21140069121\"         data-atom-type=\"guide\"    > </gu-atom> </figure>   <p>Those terms had been due to be signed off on Friday. \u201cThere is one country standing in the way \u2013 France,\u201d a diplomat said. \u201cEveryone is very frustrated. They were told that a short extension ran the risk of an accidental no-deal Brexit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is the French, always the French,\u201d said a second senior diplomat. \u201cAnd they never back down.\u201d</p> <p>Sources suggested that Macron, who described Johnson as having \u201cstrategic vision\u201d at a recent summit, was keen to appear helpful to Downing Street by keeping the pressure on MPs.</p> <p>As a result, if there is no general election, there remains the possibility that the EU will offer a shorter delay, to mid or late November, merely to allow time for ratification, although sources suggested this remained unlikely. \u201cWe agreed we all want to avoid a no deal \u2013 and a short extension will just raise the possibility,\u201d said an EU source.</p> <p>By meddling with the terms of the extension request laid out in the Benn act, the prime minister would also be placed under a different set of obligations. If the three-month extension to 31 January is offered, Johnson will have to agree to it. A different formulation would require parliament to pass a motion endorsing the extension request. Johnson would then need to formally agree to it with the EU by 30 October or within 48 hours, depending on which is earlier.</p>",

Johnson has said he will give MPs until 6 November for further scrutiny of the withdrawal agreement bill if Labour accedes to his request for a general election on 12 December. EU sources said that the chances of leaders being called to a last-minute summit to decide on an extension had risen. \u201cIt has not been ruled out at all,\u201d a source said. The 26 other member states are understood to have argued that France was playing a dangerous game by \u201cplaying ping-pong with the UK and reacting to every twist and turn\u201d. \u201cLet\u2019s take a step back,\u201d one diplomat said. The delay is politically difficult for Jeremy Corbyn, who had said Labour would only vote in favour of a general election if the EU confirmed it would grant an extension to 31 January, taking a no-deal Brexit off the table. The prime minister responded to the latest developments by calling for the Labour leader to \u201cman up\u201d. After the two-hour meeting in Brussels on Friday, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, had conceded that an \u201cexcellent\u201d discussion had concluded without any clear way forward. \u201cNo decision,\u201d he said. An EU source said of the meeting of EU27 ambassadors: \u201cThere was full agreement on the need for an extension. There was full agreement to reach a unanimous, consensual EU27 decision. And there was full agreement to aim to take the decision by written procedure \u2026 Work will continue over the weekend.\u201d The diplomatic source added that EU27 diplomats were \u201cexpected to meet early next week to finalise an agreement\u201d and that the president of the European council, Donald Tusk, had \u201cno intention\u201d of calling a summit. A majority of member states want to accept the terms of an extension reluctantly requested by Johnson, under which Brexit could be delayed until 31 January, but with the opportunity to leave earlier if the withdrawal agreement was ratified in Westminster and by the European parliament. Those terms had been due to be signed off on Friday. \u201cThere is one country standing in the way \u2013 France,\u201d a diplomat said. \u201cEveryone is very frustrated. They were told that a short extension ran the risk of an accidental no-deal Brexit.\u201d \u201cIt is the French, always the French,\u201d said a second senior diplomat. \u201cAnd they never back down.\u201d Sources suggested that Macron, who described Johnson as having \u201cstrategic vision\u201d at a recent summit, was keen to appear helpful to Downing Street by keeping the pressure on MPs. As a result, if there is no general election, there remains the possibility that the EU will offer a shorter delay, to mid or late November, merely to allow time for ratification, although sources suggested this remained unlikely. \u201cWe agreed we all want to avoid a no deal \u2013 and a short extension will just raise the possibility,\u201d said an EU source. By meddling with the terms of the extension request laid out in the Benn act, the prime minister would also be placed under a different set of obligations. If the three-month extension to 31 January is offered, Johnson will have to agree to it. A different formulation would require parliament to pass a motion endorsing the extension request. Johnson would then need to formally agree to it with the EU by 30 October or within 48 hours, depending on which is earlier.",

But Abdul-Mahdi has been unable to address the growing discontent with promises of reform.

A government-appointed inquiry determined that security forces had used excessive force and recommended the firing of security chiefs in Baghdad and the south. Eight members of the security forces were also killed.</p> \n<p>Iraq\u2019s most senior Shia spiritual leader, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, appealed in his Friday prayers to the protesters and security forces to avoid violence and urged the former to abstain from attacking security forces or public property.</p> \n<p>The current round of protests has been endorsed by his chief rival, the nationalist Shia cleric, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/14/iraq-elections-who-is-moqtadr-al-sadr\">Mo</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/14/iraq-elections-who-is-moqtadr-al-sadr\">qtada al-Sadr</a>, who has a popular support base and the largest number of seats in parliament.</p>",

Tens of thousands gathered in Tahrir Square in central Baghdad on Friday morning to begin the march to the city\u2019s fortified Green Zone, where government buildings and foreign embassies are located, but were blocked by police on the al-Jumhuriya bridge. The demonstrators, protesting against corruption and economic hardship, pushed back but were met with volleys of teargas, some canisters exploding in the air and others whooshing to a white arch in the middle of the crowd. Unlike in previous demonstrations the police did not use live ammunition. Medics said two protesters were killed when they were hit by teargas canisters. Dozens of ambulances and rickshaws ferried young men suffocating or hit by the canisters. Volunteers distributed water and washed faces with cola or milk, while others prepared sandwiches and lunch. Violent unrest erupted in Baghdad in early October, spreading to southern cities, and has posed the biggest challenge to the prime minister, Adil Abdul-Mahdi, since he took office. Many Iraqis live in poverty with limited access to clean water, electricity, education and healthcare. But Abdul-Mahdi has been unable to address the growing discontent with promises of reform. In an address on Thursday night he warned that a collapse of the government would drag Iraq further into turmoil. On Friday protesters in the southern city of Nasiriyah broke into the provincial government building and set it on fire, police said, while six protesters were wounded in the southern city of Amara in the Maysan district, when guards at the local office of Shia militia group Asa\u2019ib Ahl al-Haq opened fire. Protesters in Baghdad, who had organised through social media, also directed their anger against Iran, Iraq\u2019s powerful neighbour. The crowd chanted \u201cIran out, out\u201d and ridiculed Qasem Soleimani, the Iranian general seen as the \u201cgodfather\u201d of the current government. Many were draped in Iraqi flags as they crossed the bridge, declaring \u201cour soul, our blood, we sacrifice for you Iraq.\u201d One policeman who was marching with the protesters picked up a teargas canister and threw it back, urging them not to be scared. \u201cThey have eaten away at the country like cancer,\u201d said Abu Ali al-Majidi, 55, pointing in the direction of the government buildings in the Green Zone. \u201cThey are all corrupt thieves,\u201d he added, surrounded by his four sons who had come along for the protest. The demonstrations are similar to those that have engulfed Lebanon in recent days, in that they are economically driven, largely leaderless and spontaneous against what is seen as a sectarian-based system and a corrupt political class driving the two countries to the brink of economic collapse. Earlier this month, violence spread across Iraq and left 149 protesters dead. A government-appointed inquiry determined that security forces had used excessive force and recommended the firing of security chiefs in Baghdad and the south. Eight members of the security forces were also killed. Iraq\u2019s most senior Shia spiritual leader, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, appealed in his Friday prayers to the protesters and security forces to avoid violence and urged the former to abstain from attacking security forces or public property. The current round of protests has been endorsed by his chief rival, the nationalist Shia cleric, Moqtada al-Sadr, who has a popular support base and the largest number of seats in parliament.",

      "bodyText": "Police have arrested a married couple in Warrington as part of the investigation into the deaths of 39 people found in the back of a lorry in Essex. The man and woman, both 38 and from Warrington, were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to traffic people and on suspicion of 39 counts of manslaughter, Essex police said. The arrests at 5am on Friday followed raids at addresses in Cheshire. The 25-year-old driver of the lorry, named as Mo Robinson, from Northern Ireland, was arrested in the early hours of Wednesday and remains in custody. Bulgarian TV has named Joanna Maher, 38, from Warrington, as an owner of the Scania lorry cab at the centre of the investigation. She and her husband, Thomas, also 38, who is reportedly a haulage boss, told reporters they had owned the cab but sold it 13 months ago to a company in County Monaghan, near where Robinson lives. Detectives from Cheshire police were searching a house in the Woolston area of Warrington on Friday where the couple and their three children have lived for the last two years. Police cars and vans came and went from the detached property throughout the morning and plainclothes officers were seen entering the house carrying boxes. Two grey Range Rover Discoverys with matching personalised number plates and a white Chevrolet sports car were parked on the drive. The Mahers told reporters on Thursday night that they had sold the cab and felt disgust and shock at the fate of the migrants. The couple, who have not been seen since, were described by neighbours as \u201cjust another normal family\u201d.. One neighbour who did not want to be named said: \u201cWe have a friendly, neighbourly relationship. Both Thomas and Joanne are very approachable. I am very shocked but we don\u2019t know the truth of it all yet. I know that Joanne has said that she sold the cab, so who knows?\u201d The couple are believed to own at least two small businesses in the Warrington area and previously lived in a more modest house about two miles away. \ufeffThe route undertaken by the lorry trailer will be one of the key priorities of the cross-border investigation. The trailer was leased from one Irish company, the Monaghan-based Global Trailer Rental Europe, on 15 October to another business on the Irish border. It was the first time the second business had made such a leasing arrangement. Sources have said GPS data from the refrigerated unit shows that it left Monaghan on 15 October and crossed into Northern Ireland and then back south into Ireland. It then travelled from Dublin port to Holyhead in north Wales overnight on 16 October, and crossed to mainland Europe that evening. The trailer travelled to Dunkirk and Lille in France, and Bruges in Belgium. Dunkirk is a 40-minute drive from Calais and is a known site for people smugglers preying on migrants seeking to cross the Channel to the UK. The data from the tracking device, which has been passed on to Essex police investigating the deaths, also shows the trailer made two journeys between the UK and mainland Europe between 17 and 22 October. On Thursday, police officers began moving the victims from the port of Tilbury to the mortuary at Broomfield hospital in Chelmsford. The first postmortem examinations were to start on Friday. The force said: \u201cFormal identification will then follow the coronial process and will be a lengthy but crucial part of this investigation. As our investigations continue, the picture may change regarding identification, and we will continue to provide updates when appropriate under the direction of HM coroner.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A Saudi-brokered agreement has been reached between the warring sides in the south of Yemen, paving the way for wider peace talks to end the five-year civil war. The Southern Transitional Council, backed by the United Arab Emirates, in August seized control of the southern port city of Aden, leaving the Saudi- and UN-backed government led by President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi in possession of little land or effective power. Hadi had already been thrown out of Yemen\u2019s capital, Sana\u2019a, in 2014 by Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. The split in the south between Hadi and the STC pitted two normal Gulf allies \u2013 the UAE and Saudi Arabia \u2013 against one another. The newly negotiated government will involve a 24-member government with an equal number of ministries allocated to the STC and Hadi supporters. The deal is a significant enhancement of the status of the STC, which has previously been excluded from all UN-brokered peace deals, and STC sources appeared to be more pleased with the agreement than the other side. The STC move against Aden in August came after the UAE announced it was pulling most of its troops out of Yemen, leaving Saudi Arabia exposed as the main interventionist regional power. The STC, which is opposed to the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood-aligned party al-Islah in Hadi\u2019s government, said it had discovered rampant corruption once it took over military posts in August. The new agreement, negotiated in Jeddah and Riyadh over more than a month, includes new measures to crack down on corruption and ensure a more even allocation of resources by Yemen\u2019s central bank. The draft agreement postpones the secession issue until the war with the Houthis has been resolved. The STC supports Yemen splitting in two as it was before 1990, and is arguably less committed to the battle to throw the Houthis out of Sana\u2019a, including its bases from which it mounts air raids over the border into Saudi Arabia. The UN special envoy for Yemen, Martin Griffiths, had thought he would be able to announce the agreement between Hadi and the STC last week, but a last-minute dispute over the allocation of resources held back the deal. Griffiths was in Riyadh on Thursday for talks with the Saudi deputy defence minister, Prince Khalid bin Salman. In preparation for the agreement Saudi forces have already moved into Aden and key military bases, replacing departing UAE troops. The Houthis in September offered a ceasefire with Saudi Arabia, ending their increasingly effective drone and cruise missile attacks into Saudi territory. An extensive prisoner swap programme has been agreed, but the UN is pressing the Saudis to do more to reciprocate. In a further sign of slow diplomatic progress, four joint observation posts have been established to monitor the ceasefire at the Red Sea port of Hodeida, for many years the flashpoint of conflict between the Houthis and Hadi forces.",

      "body": "<p>Pope Francis offered the staff of the Vatican some <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2019/09/24/us/pope-adjectives-intl-hnk-scli/index.html\">writing advice</a> in September: \u201cGive up using adjectives\u201d \u2013 and also adverbs, as in phrases such as \u201cauthentically Christian\u201d, to which he declared himself allergic. I suppose if there\u2019s anyone you can\u2019t condemn for pontificating like this, it\u2019s the pontiff. Yet his advice annoyed me, as did some newly <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02918-5?utm_source=commission_junction&amp;utm_medium=affiliate\">published tips</a> aimed at scientists from the novelist Cormac McCarthy, who turns out to have been giving behind-the-scenes editorial advice to leading researchers for years. \u201cRemove extra words or commas whenever you can,\u201d reads McCarthy\u2019s advice (as paraphrased by two of his academic collaborators). Also: \u201cDon\u2019t overelaborate.\u201d Though he\u2019s less of a stickler than Francis when it comes to adjectives: \u201cOnly use an adjective if it\u2019s relevant.\u201d In short, we\u2019re back to William Strunk and EB White\u2019s famous advice in <a href=\"https://www.dailywritingtips.com/strunk-and-whites-the-elements-of-style/\">The Elements </a><a href=\"https://www.dailywritingtips.com/strunk-and-whites-the-elements-of-style/\">Of Style</a>: \u201cOmit needless words.\u201d</p> <p>My issue with all this isn\u2019t the fact that you can \u2013 who\u2019d have guessed it? \u2013 find plenty of adjectives and adverbs in the <a href=\"http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20150524_enciclica-laudato-si.html\">pope\u2019s own writing</a>. Nor is it that McCarthy\u2019s admonition against overelaboration is redundant. (Of course you shouldn\u2019t overelaborate; that\u2019s why they call it overelaboration.) As the <a href=\"http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004096.html\">linguist Geoff Pullum notes</a>, \u201comit needless words\u201d is a bit suspect, too, since clearly you shouldn\u2019t omit needful words, so the word \u201cneedless\u201d is itself needless. So \u201comit words\u201d might make more sense, except that it\u2019s stupid. No, my issue with all this advice to eliminate unnecessary verbiage is: unnecessary for what? Claims of necessity or superfluity imply some end goal, but it\u2019s rare to see one explicitly stated.</p> <p>After all, the complex scientific jargon that McCarthy disdains isn\u2019t usually there, I\u2019d argue, because the authors knew no better; it\u2019s because their goal isn\u2019t solely to communicate, but also to signal their knowledge and qualifications. (This is a bad goal to aim for, I\u2019d say. But so long as academics have powerful incentives to do so, style advice won\u2019t solve things.)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/sep/27/why-anything-is-better-than-nothing\">Do as much as you can \u2013 not as little as you can get away with | Oliver Burkeman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile, a talented novelist can harness verbosity to good communicative ends. How many of the words in Lucy Ellman\u2019s new 1,000-page novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/15/ducks-newburyport-by-lucy-ellmann-review\" title=\"\">Ducks, Newburyport</a> are needful? For that matter, how many novels are needful at all? How many of the words ever written truly <em>had</em> to be written, other than signs saying things like \u201cDangerous cliff edge, keep away\u201d, or \u201cWarning: contains bleach\u201d?</p> <p>In any case, my hunch is that verbosity of the bad kind rarely arises because the writer hasn\u2019t yet been told, whether by popes or novelists, to cut it out. Rather, it arises when you haven\u2019t properly figured out what it is you\u2019re trying to say. Whenever I\u2019m stuck on how to express something \u2013 or I read my writing back, and have the feeling that it\u2019s missing the point \u2013 the problem is never one of style. It\u2019s that I haven\u2019t clarified exactly what that point is, and that I\u2019ve been engaged in a subconscious effort to avoid having to do so.</p> <p>So instead of \u201comit needless words\u201d, try \u201cinvest needful effort\u201d. Make yourself do the job of pinpointing your message, in your own mind, and the writing will come easily. I mean, it probably will.

      "bodyText": "Pope Francis offered the staff of the Vatican some writing advice in September: \u201cGive up using adjectives\u201d \u2013 and also adverbs, as in phrases such as \u201cauthentically Christian\u201d, to which he declared himself allergic. I suppose if there\u2019s anyone you can\u2019t condemn for pontificating like this, it\u2019s the pontiff. Yet his advice annoyed me, as did some newly published tips aimed at scientists from the novelist Cormac McCarthy, who turns out to have been giving behind-the-scenes editorial advice to leading researchers for years. \u201cRemove extra words or commas whenever you can,\u201d reads McCarthy\u2019s advice (as paraphrased by two of his academic collaborators). Also: \u201cDon\u2019t overelaborate.\u201d Though he\u2019s less of a stickler than Francis when it comes to adjectives: \u201cOnly use an adjective if it\u2019s relevant.\u201d In short, we\u2019re back to William Strunk and EB White\u2019s famous advice in The Elements Of Style: \u201cOmit needless words.\u201d My issue with all this isn\u2019t the fact that you can \u2013 who\u2019d have guessed it? \u2013 find plenty of adjectives and adverbs in the pope\u2019s own writing. Nor is it that McCarthy\u2019s admonition against overelaboration is redundant. (Of course you shouldn\u2019t overelaborate; that\u2019s why they call it overelaboration.) As the linguist Geoff Pullum notes, \u201comit needless words\u201d is a bit suspect, too, since clearly you shouldn\u2019t omit needful words, so the word \u201cneedless\u201d is itself needless. So \u201comit words\u201d might make more sense, except that it\u2019s stupid. No, my issue with all this advice to eliminate unnecessary verbiage is: unnecessary for what? Claims of necessity or superfluity imply some end goal, but it\u2019s rare to see one explicitly stated. After all, the complex scientific jargon that McCarthy disdains isn\u2019t usually there, I\u2019d argue, because the authors knew no better; it\u2019s because their goal isn\u2019t solely to communicate, but also to signal their knowledge and qualifications. (This is a bad goal to aim for, I\u2019d say. But so long as academics have powerful incentives to do so, style advice won\u2019t solve things.) Meanwhile, a talented novelist can harness verbosity to good communicative ends. How many of the words in Lucy Ellman\u2019s new 1,000-page novel Ducks, Newburyport are needful? For that matter, how many novels are needful at all? How many of the words ever written truly had to be written, other than signs saying things like \u201cDangerous cliff edge, keep away\u201d, or \u201cWarning: contains bleach\u201d? In any case, my hunch is that verbosity of the bad kind rarely arises because the writer hasn\u2019t yet been told, whether by popes or novelists, to cut it out. Rather, it arises when you haven\u2019t properly figured out what it is you\u2019re trying to say. Whenever I\u2019m stuck on how to express something \u2013 or I read my writing back, and have the feeling that it\u2019s missing the point \u2013 the problem is never one of style. It\u2019s that I haven\u2019t clarified exactly what that point is, and that I\u2019ve been engaged in a subconscious effort to avoid having to do so. So instead of \u201comit needless words\u201d, try \u201cinvest needful effort\u201d. Make yourself do the job of pinpointing your message, in your own mind, and the writing will come easily. I mean, it probably will. Unlike some, I wouldn\u2019t claim to be infallible. Read this Steven Pinker\u2019s book The Sense Of Style draws on evolutionary theory to show you how to tailor your language to our millennia-old brains.",

Outside court, the Ministry of Defence claimed it had already made changes following the tragedy in the Brecon Beacons in 2013 and would do everything it could to prevent such a disaster happening again. But on 19 July 2016 \u2013 almost exactly a year after the coroner\u2019s highly critical remarks \u2013 there was yet another death in the same area of south Wales on a similar searingly hot day. Carrying 25kg (55lb) of equipment, Cpl Joshua Hoole, 26, collapsed 400 metres from the end of an eight-mile course as the temperature built towards 30C (86F). During the four-week inquest into Hoole\u2019s death heard by the same coroner in Birmingham this October, many of the issues that were pored over during the SAS hearing came to the forefront again. How was the exercise planned? Should it have been stopped when soldiers began to fall? Did the army really understand the danger heat poses during training even in southern Britain? Had lessons really been learned since the SAS deaths? Hoole was a talented and popular member of 1 Rifles from southern Scotland who joined the army in 2008, served in Afghanistan and had a bright future ahead of him. \u201cHe shone his light on all of us,\u201d said his father, Phillip Hoole, himself a former army sergeant major. \u201cHad his life not been extinguished, I am sure that he would have achieved much more.\u201d At first, it seemed that hot weather was not to blame. A defence service inquiry concluded Hoole had died not because of the heat but an undiagnosed underlying medical condition, sudden arrhythmic death syndrome. But Hoole\u2019s father came to doubt that conclusion and, believing there to be organisational failings in the way the exercise was handled, successfully applied for a full and detailed inquest to take place. During the inquest it has emerged that of the 41 corporals and lance corporals taking part in the annual fitness test (AFT) that day, only 24 completed the course. The average drop-out on the same route for the whole of the previous year was 3%. Vivid accounts were given of how some of those who took part in the AFT came to fall. Cpl Anasa Matau described being hit by \u201cheat and exhaustion\u201d. He said: \u201cMy core body was hot, I had salty deposits around my mouth and hands, and I told myself I thought I was dehydrated.\u201d He was so confused that he tried to get his combat shirt off without removing his daysack.

As during the SAS inquest there was much focus on a piece of kit called the wet bulb globe thermometer (WBGT), which takes factors such as heat, humidity and wind into account when producing a reading. Havenith told the inquest the readings from the WBGT could not have been relied on by those in charge of the exercise because it was positioned in the shade of a gym building. The fitness instructors who were in charge of the WBGT on the day of Hoole\u2019s death said they had not received any training on how to use the device for at least 10 years. Despite the MoD\u2019s promises to learn lessons after the SAS tragedy, worrying signs emerged that there may still be problems over the running of exercises on hot days. A captain who signed off a risk assessment for the AFT said he had read a crucial document called JSP 539 \u2013 which relates to climatic illness and was featured repeatedly during the SAS inquest \u2013 but was not trained to interpret it.

      "bodyText": "A senior coroner hearing the inquest of a soldier who died while taking part in a fitness test on a searingly hot day in the Brecon Beacons has strongly criticised the army for not learning from failings exposed when three men suffered fatal heat illness during an SAS trial. Cpl Joshua Hoole, 26, died near the end of an eight-mile course in south Wales in July 2016, three years after three army reservists collapsed in the same area in the SAS march. Giving her conclusions, the coroner Louise Hunt said a string of \u201cvery serious failings\u201d had meant the annual fitness test (AFT) in which Hoole was taking part was not safe.

He claimed the report contained lies and inaccuracies. Bryher Dunsby, whose husband James was one of the three who died in the SAS test, said she believed there had been an attempt to cover up what happened to Hoole. She said: \u201cThe MoD are willing to defend themselves at all costs, regardless of truth or justice for the individual who has died and their families.\u201d Dunsby said she knew that special forces had updated and modernised their training and attitude to heat. \u201cHowever, this clearly has not been transferred to the rest of the British army.

In fact, those in charge of the AFT thought he had an ankle injury. The soldier was told later in hospital he could have died if he had not stopped. Hunt oversaw the SAS inquest in 2015 and issued a report intended to prevent further deaths, specifically raising concerns about issues such as the lack of awareness about heat and risk assessments. She said: \u201cThe failure of the army to learn from previous mistakes is a very concerning matter for me.\u201d She said she would write another report on preventing further deaths to the defence secretary.

Hunt concluded that \u201cheat stress\u201d was one of a number of factors that led to Hoole\u2019s death, although she said it was not the sole factor and he also had an underlying heart condition. Brig Christopher Coles expressed regret but did not offer an apology to Hoole\u2019s family. He said: \u201cThe MoD has acknowledged that aspects of the policy in place which governed the training Cpl Hoole was undertaking could have been better and was in areas inconsistent. While much work has already been done to address this, we will seek to ensure it is refined and improved to help ensure a tragedy like Cpl Hoole\u2019s death is not repeated.\u201d",

Weather warnings are in place for \u201cheavy and persistent\u201d rain stretching from the south-west of Britain, across the whole of Wales and through much of the Midlands, to northern England.

      "bodyText": "To be hailed as a truly great tournament this Rugby World Cup needs at least one epic knockout occasion. And here it comes, thundering out of the tunnel at full throttle with its headlights blazing bright. It is 12 years since New Zealand last lost a World Cup game but their onrushing semi-final with England could prove an era-defining fixture. Dodge the approaching white bullet train and the All Blacks will be just 80 minutes away from becoming the first team in history to win three consecutive Webb Ellis Cups. The final would still await but, having beaten South Africa in the pool stages and not lost to Wales for 66 years, there would be legitimate grounds for optimism. Win again and, with three World Cup successes, captain Kieran Read, Sam Whitelock and Sonny Bill Williams would even edge beyond all-time greats like Richie McCaw and Dan Carter. It makes them uniquely dangerous opponents, not least in a land where All Black replica shirts sell particularly well. Consider, though, the flip side of the Kiwi two-dollar coin. In terms of generating fresh interest and momentum in England, a red rose victory would transcend anything since 2003. For the most united squad to have worn the national jersey since those halcyon days, victory would also validate some of the less cosy aspects of Eddie Jones\u2019s relentless regime. At a stroke it would triumphantly justify four years of training field sweat and, perhaps even more crucially for the Rugby Football Union, transform global perceptions of English rugby. For anyone in their mid teens or younger, World Cups have so far yielded only furrowed brows, ferry frolics and frustration. If those three f\u2019s can be replaced with fast, furious and fun, Twickenham\u2019s bank overdraft will disappear soon enough. How, then, to make it happen? Just two England teams, in 1973 and 2003, have ever beaten the All Blacks away from Twickenham and there is no World Cup precedent. The mind\u2019s eye, instead, still spools back to Jonah Lomu gathering pace in front of the Newlands press box in 1995 before stampeding over a helpless Mike Catt to set the instant tone in the only previous semi-final between these sides. If ever there was a moment for an Englishman to make a similarly dramatic impact, this is it. Or, to be strictly accurate, 23 Englishmen. While New Zealand have played the more dazzling rugby so far, there might just be a collective glimmer of hope for Jones\u2019s tight-bonded squad.

      "body": "<h2>\u2018My biggest issue is safety\u2019</h2> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a woman so my biggest issue is safety. South Africa is beautiful and has a lot going for it. However, poverty resulting from high unemployment and inequality result in high crime rates and extensive gender-based violence. Business is hoarding capital, resulting in low investment rates, once more contributing to high unemployment. Those in power (business and otherwise) don\u2019t seem to care how rampant economic inequality is contributing to the very same ills they bemoan. They seem to be happy behind their gated communities, forgetting that they won\u2019t be insulated forever. On the surface the country seems to have integrated well, but rampart poverty and crime are eating into any gains made after the fall of apartheid.\u201d<br><em>Sovuyo Zee, 43, Johannesburg</em></p> <h2>\u2018Cities are inaccessible for most\u2019</h2> <p>\u201cI will speak on Cape Town in particular. The constitutional right to movement has changed so people of colour are able to move in different areas. However, the economic and land ownership disadvantages which are still linked to people of colour make cities inaccessible for most to live and thrive in. Also, the criminalisation of homelessness further entrenches the lived reality that only a few have the right to the city.<br><em>Ntandoyenkosi Mlambo, 25, Cape Town</em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/oct/21/why-are-south-african-cities-still-segregated-after-apartheid\">Why are South African cities still so segregated 25 years after apartheid? | Justice Malala</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>\u2018We have the vote but that won\u2019t keep the gangsters away\u2019</h2> <p>\u201cCape Town is still very racially polarised. White people still live in the best areas and \u2018coloured\u2019 areas have become significantly more dangerous. In the past 25 years I\u2019ve spent thousands on beefing up my security. In 1995 I had no front wall and kids played on the grass verges. Today I have a 2m wall, electric gates, CCTV, electric fence and armed response. <br>White areas are still well kept, large plots, and relatively safe. The best schools are still in the white areas. It\u2019s unbelievable but true that if you live in a leafy suburb like Constantia and work in the city, you\u2019ll think you\u2019re in Europe while less than 15km in the opposite direction people still have little access to proper toilets and live in ramshackle houses. This is the price we pay for our \u2018democracy\u2019 and capitalism. We have the vote but that won\u2019t keep the gangsters away or protect your family from the rain or feed them.\u201d <br><em>Anonymous, grew up in Cape Town in a \u201ccoloured area\u201d and now lives abroad but visit regularly</em></p> <h2>\u2018The damage of apartheid can\u2019t be undone in 25 years\u2019</h2> <p>There has been more integration in Joburg, still need a lot more though, but definitely things have changed. The schools in Joburg (both public and private) are far more reflective of the actual demographics of the city. Joburg has had a significant growth in its black middle class and and I think it is the most cosmopolitan city in the country. Just look at the recent SA supporters at the Rugby World Cup in Japan: there has been a significant increase in black support for what was historically a very white-dominated sport. The idea of a rainbow nation that Nelson Mandela\u2019s era inspired is unfortunately a long-term aspiration that will probably take another generation or two to achieve. I don\u2019t think the damage of 50 years of apartheid can be undone in 25 years. I hope my reflection in 2044 will be more positive!<br><em>Anonymous, Johannesburg</em><br></p> <h2>\u2018The effects of apartheid are still with us, even if the laws are not\u2019</h2> <p>\u201cIn some ways very little [has changed], and in some ways a great deal. The most noticeable change is that you see black and white people, especially children, playing together in the streets or walking around shopping malls without the police questioning them or their parents. You see black and white people eating at the same restaurants and talking to each other in public. </p> <p>But in the area where we live, which was a white Group Area during apartheid, most of the residents are still white. When we visit friends in Mamelodi, a formerly all-black township, we see no white people on the streets. The effects of apartheid are still with us, even if the laws are not.<br><em>Stephen Hayes, 78, City of Tshwane</em></p> <h2>\u2018Some suburbs are now more diverse\u2019</h2> <p>\u201cSince the end of apartheid, people are free to live where they want. Some suburbs have thus become better integrated and more diverse, which is an improvement. However, some areas remain composed of predominantly one racial group because of socio-economic reasons. The new divisions in where people live are along economic lines rather than racial lines, but because apartheid economically and otherwise disadvantaged black and coloured people, the economic lines tend to mirror the racial lines. The cost of living and unemployment has increased, so many people are poorer. The number of townships in Cape Town has increased, because once restriction on movement ended, many people also moved to the cities from rural areas looking for jobs.

      "bodyText": "\u2018My biggest issue is safety\u2019 \u201cI\u2019m a woman so my biggest issue is safety. South Africa is beautiful and has a lot going for it. However, poverty resulting from high unemployment and inequality result in high crime rates and extensive gender-based violence. Business is hoarding capital, resulting in low investment rates, once more contributing to high unemployment. Those in power (business and otherwise) don\u2019t seem to care how rampant economic inequality is contributing to the very same ills they bemoan. They seem to be happy behind their gated communities, forgetting that they won\u2019t be insulated forever. On the surface the country seems to have integrated well, but rampart poverty and crime are eating into any gains made after the fall of apartheid.\u201d Sovuyo Zee, 43, Johannesburg \u2018Cities are inaccessible for most\u2019 \u201cI will speak on Cape Town in particular. The constitutional right to movement has changed so people of colour are able to move in different areas. However, the economic and land ownership disadvantages which are still linked to people of colour make cities inaccessible for most to live and thrive in. Also, the criminalisation of homelessness further entrenches the lived reality that only a few have the right to the city. Ntandoyenkosi Mlambo, 25, Cape Town \u2018We have the vote but that won\u2019t keep the gangsters away\u2019 \u201cCape Town is still very racially polarised. White people still live in the best areas and \u2018coloured\u2019 areas have become significantly more dangerous. In the past 25 years I\u2019ve spent thousands on beefing up my security. In 1995 I had no front wall and kids played on the grass verges. Today I have a 2m wall, electric gates, CCTV, electric fence and armed response. White areas are still well kept, large plots, and relatively safe. The best schools are still in the white areas. It\u2019s unbelievable but true that if you live in a leafy suburb like Constantia and work in the city, you\u2019ll think you\u2019re in Europe while less than 15km in the opposite direction people still have little access to proper toilets and live in ramshackle houses. This is the price we pay for our \u2018democracy\u2019 and capitalism. We have the vote but that won\u2019t keep the gangsters away or protect your family from the rain or feed them.\u201d Anonymous, grew up in Cape Town in a \u201ccoloured area\u201d and now lives abroad but visit regularly \u2018The damage of apartheid can\u2019t be undone in 25 years\u2019 There has been more integration in Joburg, still need a lot more though, but definitely things have changed. The schools in Joburg (both public and private) are far more reflective of the actual demographics of the city. Joburg has had a significant growth in its black middle class and and I think it is the most cosmopolitan city in the country. Just look at the recent SA supporters at the Rugby World Cup in Japan: there has been a significant increase in black support for what was historically a very white-dominated sport. The idea of a rainbow nation that Nelson Mandela\u2019s era inspired is unfortunately a long-term aspiration that will probably take another generation or two to achieve. I don\u2019t think the damage of 50 years of apartheid can be undone in 25 years. I hope my reflection in 2044 will be more positive! Anonymous, Johannesburg \u2018The effects of apartheid are still with us, even if the laws are not\u2019 \u201cIn some ways very little [has changed], and in some ways a great deal. The most noticeable change is that you see black and white people, especially children, playing together in the streets or walking around shopping malls without the police questioning them or their parents. You see black and white people eating at the same restaurants and talking to each other in public. But in the area where we live, which was a white Group Area during apartheid, most of the residents are still white. When we visit friends in Mamelodi, a formerly all-black township, we see no white people on the streets. The effects of apartheid are still with us, even if the laws are not. Stephen Hayes, 78, City of Tshwane \u2018Some suburbs are now more diverse\u2019 \u201cSince the end of apartheid, people are free to live where they want. Some suburbs have thus become better integrated and more diverse, which is an improvement. However, some areas remain composed of predominantly one racial group because of socio-economic reasons. The new divisions in where people live are along economic lines rather than racial lines, but because apartheid economically and otherwise disadvantaged black and coloured people, the economic lines tend to mirror the racial lines. The cost of living and unemployment has increased, so many people are poorer. The number of townships in Cape Town has increased, because once restriction on movement ended, many people also moved to the cities from rural areas looking for jobs. Although the government has provided new housing since the end of apartheid, the increase in people moving to the city has meant that they are unable to keep up with the demand for housing and other facilities.\u201d Anonymous, former Cape Town resident \u2018South African cities are slowly integrating\u2019 \u201cSouth African cities are slowly integrating, and will eventually integrate completely, but progress has been slow.

Releasing the devastating last text message from Pham Thi Tra My, her family said they were desperately seeking information and trying to verify whether she was one of those who had died. Initial reports by police had suggested all the victims were believed to be Chinese. Essex police declined to comment when approached by the Guardian. In a separate statement on Friday, the force said: \u201cAs our investigations continue, the picture may change regarding identification.\u201d Meanwhile, two more people have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter. While the police have not yet confirmed the identities of those in the trailer, the family\u2019s fears highlight the difficulties in obtaining information on trafficked individuals. In the message to her mother, feared to have been sent in her final moments, the 26-year-old wrote that she was struggling to breathe and apologised. The message, translated into English by a family acquaintance, was received at 4.28am on Wednesday morning in Vietnam, a screenshot shows. This would have been 10.28pm UK time, when the trailer carrying the victims would have been in transit \u2013 and just four hours before the ambulance was called and the bodies were discovered.

I am sorry, Mum.\u201d One message has been blanked out because it mentioned the family\u2019s address. The screenshot also shows that Pham has not accessed the account since Wednesday. The Vietnamese embassy in London confirmed it had contacted police in regard to a missing woman feared to be one of the 39 people found dead. A spokesman for the embassy said it had been contacted by a family in Vietnam who claimed their daughter had been missing since the lorry was found. The spokesman said: \u201cWe have contacted Essex police and we are waiting for an answer.\u201d The BBC later reported that Pham\u2019s family had to pay \u00a330,000 to traffickers for her journey to the UK. A family acquaintance confirmed to the Guardian that Pham\u2019s family had to remortgage their home to pay the sum. It was also reported two other Vietnamese families have relatives missing. A 26-year-old man and a 19-year-old woman. The 19-year-old\u2019s brother told the BBC she called him early on Tuesday to say she was getting into a container and would be switching her phone off to avoid being caught. They had not heard from her since and the people smugglers had since returned money to the family. Relatives of the 26-year-old, with whom she was travelling with, had also been given some money back. Trafficked migrants are rarely on any kind of formal manifesto and victims\u2019 families may in some cases be in danger themselves if they acknowledge their disappearance. They may also fear that by going public they will put their loved one at risk of arrest if they are in fact still alive. Mimi Vu, a leading expert on trafficking of Vietnamese young people to Europe and the UK, said the texts appeared to be authentic. \u201cShe writes her name and where she is from, which is very important, to tell people where she should be buried.

Vu noted that occasionally people were given false Chinese passports, if they were trafficked through China, which could lead to confusion. Following Pham\u2019s disappearance, her brother posted a message on a forum regularly used by Vietnamese people looking for missing relatives. He wrote that Pham, who lived in the Nghen township in Can Loc district, left the rural province of Ha Tinh in northern Vietnam on 3 October before travelling to the capital, Hanoi, to \u201cfinalise her papers to go China\u201d. She then flew to France and on to the UK, he said. However, she was allegedly arrested on arrival in the UK before being sent back to France.

Vietnam was the country with the third highest number of suspected victims of modern slavery in the UK in 2018, as identified by the national referral mechanism (NRM), the official framework for identifying victims of human trafficking and ensuring they receive the appropriate protection and support. There were 702 Vietnamese modern slavery victims referred last year, behind 947 Albanians and 1,625 UK nationals. A 2012 government report assessing human trafficking routes highlighted a journey from Vietnam to UK that passed through China, Russia and northern or western Europe.",

He took his time before replying, although his response to the previous question, how his players had developed the mentality to see out tight matches rather than throw them away, would have been fitting.</p> \n<p>\u201cRespect for what we have done is the biggest thing,\u201d he eventually said. \u201cWhat I am most proud of is that we have earned the respect of the rest of the world, which I am not sure was there before given where we were in the world rankings (10th).

It would need New Zealand to beat England in the first semi-final before Wales took down South Africa (although if they both lose they will be in a battle for third place the day before), but Gatland\u2019s coaching career, apart from the manner of his departure from Ireland in 2001 after they had been pipped for the Six Nations by England on points difference has largely been one of dreams fulfilled.</p> \n<p>When he started with Wales, it was reported that the players had refused to have more than one contact session during the 2007 World Cup, which they exited at the group stage after losing to Fiji. \u201cWe will be having plenty of contact sessions,\u201d he said, \u201cand we will break a few players.\u201d</p> \n<p>He wanted his charges to be physical but also saw that he needed to boost the self-belief of a side that had been mentally fragile. The second task took rather longer to complete than the first.</p> \n<p>If W under Gatland has come to stand for win, before him the letter itself reflected the up-and\u2011down nature of the national side: whitewashed in the 2003 Six Nations, they won the grand slam in 2005 and avoided another wooden spoon two years later with victory over England on the final weekend. Coaches were lucky to last 12 months never mind 12 years, the domestic game was prone to regular upheaval and success was sporadic because it tended to be achieved by accident rather than design.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2154d29fbd3133c58676ac538c23ba6b6a6ee2ca\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2154d29fbd3133c58676ac538c23ba6b6a6ee2ca/0_0_8400_5642/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George North was one of the core group of youngsters Gatland began to develop more than a decade ago\" width=\"1000\" height=\"672\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George North was one of the core group of youngsters Gatland began to develop more than a decade ago.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Evans/Huw Evans/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Gatland changed all that. He learned from his Ireland experience, when at the point he thought he would be offered a new contract he was outmanoeuvred by one of his assistants, Eddie O\u2019Sullivan, and released. His first two appointments were men he had worked with at Wasps and whose loyalty he could be assured of: Shaun Edwards, the defence coach whose fierce competitiveness became quickly ingrained in his charges, and Rob Howley. Robin McBryde and Neil Jenkins followed and until <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/17/waless-rob-howley-sent-home-from-world-cup-amid-betting-allegations\" title=\"\">Howley was sent home</a> after a few days here while the Welsh Rugby Union launched an investigation after being approached by a betting company the team remained together, confounding the theory that fresh voices are needed if one playing dynasty is to follow another.</p> \n<p>Gatland won the grand slam in 2008 at the first attempt, but the next couple of years were his stickiest as he came to terms with the need of his players for direction, different to what he was used to in New Zealand and at Wasps, but he then developed a core group of youngsters \u2013 Leigh Halfpenny, George North, Jonathan Davies, Dan Lydiate, Sam Warburton and Taulupe Faletau \u2013 and moulded them in his own image.</p> \n<p>They were a missed kick from <a

      "bodyText": "Warren Gatland was asked after announcing his team to face South Africa the single biggest difference he had made since being appointed Wales\u2019s head coach 12 years ago. He took his time before replying, although his response to the previous question, how his players had developed the mentality to see out tight matches rather than throw them away, would have been fitting. \u201cRespect for what we have done is the biggest thing,\u201d he eventually said. \u201cWhat I am most proud of is that we have earned the respect of the rest of the world, which I am not sure was there before given where we were in the world rankings (10th). We have won championships and grand slams.\u201d He paused before adding: \u201cI would love to beat the All Blacks, one thing I have not achieved.\u201d He may have one final opportunity on what would be his last day with Wales, next Saturday, when the World Cup final will be played, one week before the anniversary of his appointment. It would need New Zealand to beat England in the first semi-final before Wales took down South Africa (although if they both lose they will be in a battle for third place the day before), but Gatland\u2019s coaching career, apart from the manner of his departure from Ireland in 2001 after they had been pipped for the Six Nations by England on points difference has largely been one of dreams fulfilled. When he started with Wales, it was reported that the players had refused to have more than one contact session during the 2007 World Cup, which they exited at the group stage after losing to Fiji. \u201cWe will be having plenty of contact sessions,\u201d he said, \u201cand we will break a few players.\u201d He wanted his charges to be physical but also saw that he needed to boost the self-belief of a side that had been mentally fragile. The second task took rather longer to complete than the first. If W under Gatland has come to stand for win, before him the letter itself reflected the up-and\u2011down nature of the national side: whitewashed in the 2003 Six Nations, they won the grand slam in 2005 and avoided another wooden spoon two years later with victory over England on the final weekend. Coaches were lucky to last 12 months never mind 12 years, the domestic game was prone to regular upheaval and success was sporadic because it tended to be achieved by accident rather than design. Gatland changed all that. He learned from his Ireland experience, when at the point he thought he would be offered a new contract he was outmanoeuvred by one of his assistants, Eddie O\u2019Sullivan, and released. His first two appointments were men he had worked with at Wasps and whose loyalty he could be assured of: Shaun Edwards, the defence coach whose fierce competitiveness became quickly ingrained in his charges, and Rob Howley. Robin McBryde and Neil Jenkins followed and until Howley was sent home after a few days here while the Welsh Rugby Union launched an investigation after being approached by a betting company the team remained together, confounding the theory that fresh voices are needed if one playing dynasty is to follow another. Gatland won the grand slam in 2008 at the first attempt, but the next couple of years were his stickiest as he came to terms with the need of his players for direction, different to what he was used to in New Zealand and at Wasps, but he then developed a core group of youngsters \u2013 Leigh Halfpenny, George North, Jonathan Davies, Dan Lydiate, Sam Warburton and Taulupe Faletau \u2013 and moulded them in his own image. They were a missed kick from making the 2011 World Cup final despite playing for an hour against France a man short. He has never been afraid to test a player early: Warburton was not a regular for Cardiff Blues when Gatland made him captain and in this tournament he included Rhys Carr\u00e9, who won his first cap at the end of August in the warm-up against Ireland after a handful of regional starts and the prop will again be on the bench this Sunday having leapfrogged established rivals. Players know that if they impress in training they will be given their chance. Three grand slams and a Six Nations title in 2013, when Gatland was on sabbatical with the Lions, have been supplemented by two World Cup semi-finals: the five tournaments before Gatland had brought two quarter-final appearances and three early exits. Respect has been restored with Wales enjoying their most consistent run of success since the golden era of the 1970s when they were supported by a buoyant club system rather than four regions who have been unable to make much of an impact in Europe. \u201cWarren\u2019s results on the field with Wales and the Lions speak for themselves,\u201d said South Africa\u2019s director of rugby, Rassie Erasmus. \u201cHe is an absolute legend of the game, a gentleman on and off the pitch. You seldom see him in a mud fight before matches. I have never had to reply to something he has said and he does not create unnecessary nonsense before a match. \u201cI will see him again with the Lions in 2021 and it is always a pleasure competing with him.\u201d The World Cup is the one trophy that has eluded Gatland. He turned 56 a few days before the start of the tournament and will very probably have another tilt at it.

The club won the high court battle with New Balance after the sportswear brand alleged Liverpool had refused to honour the terms of its reported \u00a340m contract which expires in May 2020. Under the terms of the deal, New Balance is entitled to renew its sponsorship if it matches the terms of any competitor\u2019s offer to sponsor Liverpool merchandise. But the current European champions, who have been offered a five-year contract of \u00a330m per year by Nike, argued that New Balance could not match its rival\u2019s offer. Ruling in Liverpool\u2019s favour in London on Friday, Mr Justice Teare said: \u201cThe New Balance offer on marketing was less favourable to Liverpool FC than the Nike offer.\u201d Nike\u2019s offer to use global superstar athletes such as the tennis player Serena Williams and the NBA star LeBron James to promote Liverpool products could not be matched by its rival, Teare found. \u201cIt must follow that Liverpool FC is not obliged to enter into a new agreement with New Balance,\u201d Teare said. New Balance immediately moved to appeal against the ruling. Opening the case last week for the brand, Daniel Oudkerk QC said the key issue was whether New Balance had matched \u201cthe material, measurable and matchable terms of a third-party offer\u201d. Liverpool argued that New Balance had not matched Nike\u2019s offer \u2013 which includes a commitment to sell licensed products in \u201cnot less than 6,000 stores worldwide, 500 of which shall be Nike-owned\u201d. Oudkerk said New Balance had approximately 40,000 retail doors globally, but the defence claimed it would not be able to distribute Liverpool merchandise to all of those stores. Oudkerk argued that Liverpool had dismissed New Balance\u2019s offer as the club was \u201cwedded to Nike\u201d and that it appeared the club had resolved to reject the New Balance match \u201ccome what may\u201d. Guy Morpuss QC, representing the club, argued that the claim was \u201creally an attempt by New Balance to use a matching clause for a purpose for which it was never intended\u201d. He said New Balance\u2019s contention that it could distribute Liverpool kit to 40,000 stores was \u201ca myth\u201d, adding the company had \u201cgrossly overstated\u201d the number of stores it could distribute to. \u201cThe idea that New Balance would even get football kit into anything close to those 40,000 stores is utterly fanciful,\u201d Morpuss said. In a statement after the ruling, a Liverpool spokesman said the club was pleased with the judge\u2019s decision. \u201cWe will continue with New Balance for the current season, in combination with preparing next season\u2019s Liverpool kits with our new supplier,\u201d he said. It is unclear whether New Balance will be granted permission to appeal.",

      "bodyText": "When Johnny Weissmuller let out his trademark yell in Tarzan in 1932, wearing an off-the-shoulder, leopard-print wrestling singlet, did he know it would double as the anguished sound going through every man\u2019s head when he contemplates wearing the pattern? He probably did not. Leopard print is the most alpha wardrobe move available to you, aside from wrapping up in muddied army fatigues accessorised with nice comfy boxing gloves and a pair of Doc Martens. And are you ready to be that guy? For his debut spring/summer 2019 menswear collection, Saint Laurent\u2019s Anthony Vaccarello featured a leopard-print shirt unbuttoned so far that it was lost somewhere in model Lennon Gallagher\u2019s chest (son of Liam: see, alpha) worn with a drunkenly tied approximation of a pussy bow. It was very, very cool and an indirect link to menswear\u2019s last great leopard-print blowout: hair metal. Heavy metal came into being at a time when ozone-depleting levels of hairspray and spandex propped up the mulleted likes of Jon Bon Jovi and Axl Rose. It was cartoonisly macho, but also referenced gender-questioners such as Marc Bolan, Mick Jagger and Bowie. Similarly, Vaccarello\u2019s 2019 menswear echoes the genderquake taking place elsewhere in culture. Off the catwalk, though, leopard print comes with its own somewhat different baggage. You could write a lengthy piece on how it semaphores a whole dollop of socio-economic subtext and emotional landscapes, be it \u201cbored housewife letting rip\u201d (Mrs Robinson) or \u201clairy TV ladettes\u201d (Dorian from Birds Of A Feather, EastEnders\u2019 Kat Slater). But let us focus instead on how to wear leopard print now. Saint Laurent may have been pushing the Cool Rock Guy vibe but other labels, including Celine, Marni and Dior, wore their leopardy items (long jackets, waistcoats) layered with other items: a nicer, safer option. Get it right, and you\u2019re hedging your bets a bit, being understated while at the same time retaining an edge. It\u2019s important to keep it confined to your top half or details. Forget leopard-print trousers unless you want to hear passersby yodel like Tarzan.",

      "body": "<p>The All Blacks have had a pack of Japanese journalists following them around this World Cup. They are the only team who have hired a full-time go-between to translate every last question and answer, which says plenty about their attention to detail and just as much about their desire to crack the Japan market. There is a five-minute slot set aside for their questions at the end of every press conference, and over the weeks, there has been one that has come up over and again.

Barrett is not a bad man to ask, because whatever they were doing down on the little dairy farm in Taranaki where he, Beauden, and Jordie grew up, it clearly worked. He said it was to do with the ball skills they learned playing different sports \u2013 \u201ccricket, basketball, athletics, hockey\u201d \u2013 but I prefer his father Kevin\u2019s answer: \u201cIt must be something in the milk.\u201d Turns out you really can bottle it.

Scott and Beauden, who are both in the starting XV, have been roommates for the first time since they shared the farm\u2019s four-bed dorm in 2002. \u201cScott\u2019s clearly got his rugby head on,\u201d Beauden says, \u201cbecause the other night he was calling out lineout moves in his sleep.\u201d They don\u2019t seem to agree which of them used to get the top bunk back home, except that it definitely wasn\u2019t little brother Jordie, who is on the bench this weekend.</p> \n<p>The change of rooms is not the only switch Scott has made lately. He is starting at blindside flanker for the first time, too. He usually does most of his training with the locks, but this week he has been a full-time member of the back row. The All Blacks\u2019 management are clearly thinking of that game at Twickenham last November, when England were five points up at half-time. Scott came on in the 50th minute and did such a number on England\u2019s lineout that they lost five of their next 10 throws. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/nov/10/england-new-zealand-autumn-international-series-report\" title=\"\">New Zealand ended up winning 16-15</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite nice to be rooming with him,\u201d Scott said, \u201cand to chat about stuff to prepare for this game.\u201d It\u2019s a shrewd move by the management, and clever, too, to stick him in with his big brother before the biggest game of his life. They have got a good understanding of the brothers\u2019 family dynamics, which the hooker, Dane Coles, explains this way: \u201cJordie is a psycho, because he\u2019s been bullied by Scott. So when we play darts in the team room, Jordie loses his guts when he throws one bad dart. Then Scott\u2019s the one who\u2019s nice and calm, and Baz is in-between. He loses it now and again but he does have that calm karma about him.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019re all pretty competitive,\u201d Beauden admits. \u201cBut you\u2019d probably find more rivalry on the lawn at home in the summertime playing backyard cricket than you would in camp. We all play in different positions so it\u2019s hard to compare.\u201d Jordie might not quite agree with that. He played No 15 in his first seven Tests, but now Beauden has moved back there he has been squeezed on to the wing or been busy filling in at fly-half.

The Labour leader insisted he was ready for another election, but told ITV\u2019s This Morning: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get no deal taken off the table first.\u201d The Brexit process is at an impasse because Johnson is refusing to proceed with his withdrawal agreement bill until parliament agrees to an election. Corbyn is refusing to do so until no deal is removed as an option, and the EU appears to be waiting until Monday\u2019s vote on an election before deciding what length of Brexit extension to grant. The Labour leader said his preference would be for Johnson to \u201ccome to parliament on Monday and make it absolutely clear there is no crash out\u201d because his deal leaves open the possibility of moving to World Trade Organization terms at the end of 2020. \u201cHe has got to take it out to my satisfaction,\u201d he said. Corbyn\u2019s statement suggests Labour would want some sort of amendment to the Brexit bill to prevent a no-deal departure before it would vote for a general election. But Johnson has shelved his Brexit legislation until an election is granted. Corbyn said a no-deal exit was \u201cvery dangerous\u201d and could lead to the closure of Ford in Bridgend, Nissan in Sunderland and Airbus in mid Wales. He denied that Labour\u2019s reluctance to go for an election was to do with his standing in the opinion polls and argued that Johnson\u2019s preferred date \u2013 12 December \u2013 was \u201creally very odd\u201d being so close to Christmas and after the end of university terms. Corbyn said an election could still take place before that time and that he wanted an election so the country could debate domestic issues and have a chance to end austerity. However, many within his shadow cabinet and parliamentary party are opposed to holding an election while Brexit remains unresolved and the party is trailing behind the Conservatives in the polls. Speaking later on Friday, Johnson struggled to explain why he was pushing so hard for an election when he had managed to reach a Brexit deal with the EU that he was refusing to let parliament debate. His main argument was that he did not want MPs to get into \u201cBrexitology\u201d without the deadline of an election hanging over them. But he has little hope of persuading Labour, the Scottish National party, the Liberal Democrats and other parties to agree to one before Christmas, meaning he will have to make a choice about what else to do with the three-month extension likely to be offered by the EU. On a visit to a hospital, Johnson said: \u201cWe can bring back the withdrawal bill, we can discuss it again in parliament, we can have more debates on Brexit, if that\u2019s what [Corbyn] really wants, but they\u2019ve got to agree a deadline, because nobody will believe that the Labour party is really going to allow Brexit to happen unless there is a deadline of an election on December 12. \u201cAnd let\u2019s be clear, this parliament has been sitting now doing absolutely nothing but delay Brexit, pushing it out with delay after delay for three-and-a-half years. \u201cAnd I think for MPs across the house to have any credibility about delivering Brexit they now have to commit to an election on December 12. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re pushing for.\u201d Johnson finished by saying Corbyn should \u201cman up\u201d and vote for his proposal for an election. No 10 had suggested on Thursday that the government could go \u201con strike\u201d and refuse to do anything until an election took place but the threat appeared to soften on Friday. After insisting they would \u201cdo the bare minimum to keep the country running\u201d on Thursday night, it emerged on Friday that the government will try to push its domestic legislation through parliament as laid out in the Queen\u2019s speech, as well as continuing to push for an early election. \u201cHe has a domestic agenda.

Oxfam said in January that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/21/world-26-richest-people-own-as-much-as-poorest-50-per-cent-oxfam-report\">world\u2019s 26 richest</a> individuals owned as much wealth as the poorest half of the global population. Billionaires grew their combined fortunes by $2.5bn a day in 2018, while the relative wealth of the world\u2019s poorest 3.8 billion people declined by $500m a day. </p> \n<p>Thousands of people have joined rolling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/extinction-rebellion\">Extinction Rebellion</a> protests at the lack of action on the climate crisis by leaders content to leave the problem to the next generation.</p> \n<p>The internet is not a determining factor \u2013 there was no social media in the 1960s \u2013 but is clearly important. Social media and the explosion of access to information is reordering hierarchies of knowledge and communication. Authorities can fight back with extensive surveillance regimes or with digital blackouts of the kind India recently imposed in disputed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/kashmir\">Kashmir</a>, but 20th-century power structures are under enormous pressure, analysts say.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe traditional system of enforcing power from top to bottom is increasingly being challenged,\u201d says Thierry de Montbrial, of the French Institute of International Relations. \u201cThere is a social revolution with a growing demand for participatory democracy.\u201d</p> \n<p>It is also easier, in a digital, globalised world, to know how the other half (or the 1%) live. \u201cThere are not just new streams of information, but streams of people,\u201d says van Stekelenburg. \u201cThose youngsters in the Arab spring in all likelihood knew at least one person living overseas, and it creates a kind of relative deprivation \u2013 \u2018I want to have that too\u2019.\u201d</p> \n<p>The proliferation of protests is no guarantee that things will change. \u201cStaging [demonstrations] is no longer the difficult part,\u201d says Youssef Cherif, a political analyst and one of the authors of new Carnegie Endowment research on the success of protest movements. \u201cThe problem is what to do after the protests, how to make your point and achieve the goals you\u2019re protesting for. That proves to be the most difficult part.\u201d</p> \n<p>Protests and revolutions are defined by idealised slogans, he says, but systematic change is harder work. \u201cYou can break off part of a system, but it\u2019s very hard to break the whole structure, which is formed of institutions and networks that are difficult to break.\u201d</p> \n<p>The leaderless nature of many of the protests makes them harder for authoritarian governments to quash, but it may also make the movements more difficult to sustain, says Sanjoy Chakravorty, a professor of global studies at Temple University. \u201cThe movements that actually led to change or that were more sustained, they had a basis, a leadership structure, people articulating, organisation, going door-to-door to get people to show up to a rally,\u201d he says. \u201cThe leadership question is central and that is the thing we haven\u2019t figured out yet: how do we actually find leadership in these inchoate displays of anger?\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"f3fb7e75a96f36408344fad859201de05665b3cc\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3fb7e75a96f36408344fad859201de05665b3cc/0_0_3500_2326/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An anti-government protester holds a teargas canister during a protest in Hong Kong.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An anti-government protester holds a teargas canister during a protest in Hong Kong.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tyrone Siu/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Hong Kong</strong></h2> \n<p><em>Lily Kuo</em></p> \n<p><strong>Who is protesting?</strong></p> \n<p>The core of the protesters are young people, many of them university or secondary school students.

      "bodyText": "In Lebanon they are against a tax on WhatsApp and endemic corruption. In Chile, a hike in the metro fare and rampant inequality. In Hong Kong, an extradition bill and creeping authoritarianism. In Algeria, a fifth term for an ageing president and decades of military rule. The protests raging today and in the past months on the streets of cities around the world have varying triggers. But the fuel is familiar: stagnating middle classes, stifled democracy and the bone-deep conviction that things can be different \u2013 even if the alternative is not always clear. Few corners of the world have been spared significant protests in 2019. Russia, Serbia, Ukraine and Albania have all seen major demonstrations. So have the UK, against Brexit, France, with its yellow vest movement, and Spain, in the restive region of Catalonia. The Middle East has convulsed with so much dissent that some are calling it a second wave of the Arab spring. In South America, Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela have experienced popular unrest. The list goes on. \u201cThe data shows that the amount of protests is increasing and is as high as the roaring 60s, and has been since about 2009,\u201d says Jacquelien van Stekelenburg, a professor who studies social change and conflict at Vrije University in Amsterdam. Not all the protests are driven by economic complaints, but widening gulfs between the haves and have-nots are radicalising many young people in particular. Oxfam said in January that the world\u2019s 26 richest individuals owned as much wealth as the poorest half of the global population. Billionaires grew their combined fortunes by $2.5bn a day in 2018, while the relative wealth of the world\u2019s poorest 3.8 billion people declined by $500m a day. Thousands of people have joined rolling Extinction Rebellion protests at the lack of action on the climate crisis by leaders content to leave the problem to the next generation. The internet is not a determining factor \u2013 there was no social media in the 1960s \u2013 but is clearly important. Social media and the explosion of access to information is reordering hierarchies of knowledge and communication. Authorities can fight back with extensive surveillance regimes or with digital blackouts of the kind India recently imposed in disputed Kashmir, but 20th-century power structures are under enormous pressure, analysts say. \u201cThe traditional system of enforcing power from top to bottom is increasingly being challenged,\u201d says Thierry de Montbrial, of the French Institute of International Relations. \u201cThere is a social revolution with a growing demand for participatory democracy.\u201d It is also easier, in a digital, globalised world, to know how the other half (or the 1%) live. \u201cThere are not just new streams of information, but streams of people,\u201d says van Stekelenburg. \u201cThose youngsters in the Arab spring in all likelihood knew at least one person living overseas, and it creates a kind of relative deprivation \u2013 \u2018I want to have that too\u2019.\u201d The proliferation of protests is no guarantee that things will change. \u201cStaging [demonstrations] is no longer the difficult part,\u201d says Youssef Cherif, a political analyst and one of the authors of new Carnegie Endowment research on the success of protest movements. \u201cThe problem is what to do after the protests, how to make your point and achieve the goals you\u2019re protesting for. That proves to be the most difficult part.\u201d Protests and revolutions are defined by idealised slogans, he says, but systematic change is harder work. \u201cYou can break off part of a system, but it\u2019s very hard to break the whole structure, which is formed of institutions and networks that are difficult to break.\u201d The leaderless nature of many of the protests makes them harder for authoritarian governments to quash, but it may also make the movements more difficult to sustain, says Sanjoy Chakravorty, a professor of global studies at Temple University. \u201cThe movements that actually led to change or that were more sustained, they had a basis, a leadership structure, people articulating, organisation, going door-to-door to get people to show up to a rally,\u201d he says. \u201cThe leadership question is central and that is the thing we haven\u2019t figured out yet: how do we actually find leadership in these inchoate displays of anger?\u201d Hong Kong Lily Kuo Who is protesting? The core of the protesters are young people, many of them university or secondary school students. But people from across society, from various sectors and age groups, have also joined the rallies and marches. What are they protesting about? Originally, a proposed change to an extradition law that would allow suspects to be transferred to mainland China and tried in courts controlled by the Communist party. That bill has been withdrawn and now protesters are demonstrating against alleged police brutality and against the government for its handling of the crisis. More broadly, they also oppose growing Chinese influence over the city. How are authorities reacting? More than 2,000 people have been arrested, and police are deploying harsher measures to put down demonstrations, including teargas, water cannons that drench people in blue dye laced with pepper solution, and in some cases live rounds. Applications from civil society groups to hold rallies are increasingly being rejected. Colonial-era emergency regulations to ban people from wearing face masks at protests have been invoked. What next? Five months in, the number of people taking part in the protests has waned. Still, the unrest shows few signs of ending soon as hardcore demonstrators vow to keep going until all their demands are met. Lebanon Michael Safi Who is protesting? A cross-section of society appears to be represented, spanning the religious and political divides that sparked 15 years of civil war in Lebanon starting in 1975. Around 1.3 million people, or 20% of the population, are thought to have attended the largest demonstrations so far, last Sunday. What are they protesting about? The government, an unsteady coalition, is divided and dysfunctional, unwilling or unable to invest in the country\u2019s crumbling roads, upgrade its electricity grid (power cuts are still a daily problem), overhaul the waste collection system or address bulging youth unemployment, among a litany of other issues. One of the triggers for the latest protests was a 20-cent tax on WhatsApp calls that the government announced as part of a suite of austerity policies to bring the country\u2019s extremely high public debt burden under control. How are authorities reacting? Because the ruling cabinet is drawn from a finely balanced collection of sectarian political parties, it is impossible for the government to speak with one voice about the protests. Generally speaking, political leaders across the spectrum have tried to sympathise with the protesters but defended the system and called for the restoration of order. Last week the cabinet agreed to a package of reforms including halving lawmakers\u2019 salaries. There have reportedly been some attempts by gunmen to intimidate protesters, and the army has used teargas against demonstrators, but the non-violent movement has generally been allowed to flourish, even as it has blocked roads and turned parts of cities into open-air dance parties. What next? There is excitement at the prospect of a new, united Lebanese identity being forged in the streets, but also concern that the country\u2019s deep political and religious divisions (and the system built on those divisions) could be reasserted, possibly through some act of sectarian violence. The protest movement is leaderless and has no clear agenda, so even if it were able to dismiss the government, it is unclear what would emerge in its place. Chile Tom Phillips Who is protesting? The protests began in Santiago as a youth-led mutiny, and students remain at the movement\u2019s heart. But as the rebellion has swelled to towns and cities outside the capital, citizens of all ages and social classes have joined in. Many protests have been peaceful but there have been outbreaks of looting and arson attacks on supermarkets, underground stations, government buildings and the headquarters of one conservative newspaper. What are they protesting about? The demonstrations were initially a response to a rise in metro ticket prices. In mid-October, high school students poured on to Santiago\u2019s metro system as part of a fare-dodging campaign designed to force the government to scrap the increase.

One of the main rallying cries of the movement is that the protests are only just beginning. \u201cChile despert\u00f3,\u201d demonstrators have chanted this week. Chile has awoken. Catalonia Sam Jones Who is protesting? Most of the protesters who have gathered on the streets of Barcelona and other Catalan towns and cities are young, mainly in their teens and 20s. However, other demonstrations \u2013 including the peaceful protest in which an estimated 525,000 people gathered in Barcelona on Friday 18 October \u2013 have drawn people of all ages, from children to pensioners. What are they protesting about? Tensions in the region soared after Spain\u2019s supreme court this month found nine Catalan separatists leaders guilty of sedition and misuse of public funds over their roles in a failed push for independence two years ago. They were sentenced to between nine and 13 years in prison. Although the Catalan independence movement has always prided itself on peaceful protests, there have been numerous violent clashes, with police officers attacked with stones, bottles, molotov cocktails and slingshots, and protesters beaten and shot with rubber and foam bullets. How are authorities reacting? Around 600 people have received medical treatment and two of them \u2013 a police officer and a demonstrator \u2013 remain in a critical condition. More than 200 people have been arrested. The government in Madrid has said its priority is maintaining public order, and it has described its response so far as proportional. It has said cooperation between officers from the national police force and their Catalan counterparts has been very effective and it has rejected calls from rightwing parties to assume direct control of the Catalan police or use the constitution to implement direct rule. The police response has been fiercely criticised by some for allegedly indiscriminately targeting innocent bystanders and members of the media. Catalonia\u2019s pro-independence regional president, Quim Torra, has also been criticised for taking too long to condemn the violence, and for calling for civil disobedience and then sending in the regional police to deal with it. What next? Things have calmed down significantly since the height of the protests at the end of last week. Torra has called for talks with the Spanish government but has also threatened to protest against the supreme court verdict by staging another unilateral referendum on Catalan independence. The Spanish government, led by acting the acting prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has dismissed the calls, accusing Torra\u2019s administration of failing to do enough to guarantee public order and of ignoring the will of the majority of Catalans who oppose independence. Even if the protests fade, the Catalan question will remain a key issue in Spain\u2019s general election next month. Iraq Michael Safi Who is protesting? This month\u2019s protests in Iraq were leaderless but mostly driven by young and unemploymed people in a country with a stubbornly high jobless rate and where nearly a quarter of the population live in poverty. What are they protesting about? After decades of sanctions, a US-led invasion and years of civil war, including against Islamic State, Iraq\u2019s infrastructure has fallen into disrepair, its public services are inadequate and it is struggling to rebuild its economy. Corruption is endemic, a problem that the country\u2019s sectarian political parties have little appetite to try to change. Iraq\u2019s protests are a howl of anger against the system.

The big question, though: which one to choose?</p> <p>I am a novelist, but diet books are my embarrassing comfort read. I read them when I am bored, stressed, on a late train, facing a deadline. Recently I realised that I use them like porn, reading my favourites over and over again. As with porn, I quickly discovered a \u201ctype\u201d of narrative that works best. Perhaps my ur-diet book is <a href=\"https://robbwolf.com\" title=\"\">Robb Wolf</a>\u2019s The Paleo Solution, which begins with the author\u2019s mysteriously sick parents, then describes how his own long period of vegetarianism left him almost dead at the age of 28, mainly as a consequence of his undiagnosed <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coeliac-disease/\" title=\"\">coeliac disease</a>. Wolf began his new life with meat and a salad, and never looked back: \u201cI was warmly satisfied, clear headed and I felt better than I had in years.

But no one else seems to have my problem, even though everyone is now an expert on diet. While most people take it all with a pinch of salt (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/aug/09/salt-not-as-damaging-to-health-as-previously-thought-says-study\" title=\"\">not so bad for your blood pressure</a>, it turns out), I take it all very, very seriously. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll ever be able to eat without a precise set of instructions. One major joy of my diet books is feeling that I belong, that I am part of a belief system, a member of a team. But the downside is, this stuff can send you <a href=\"https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/health-benefits-nuts\" title=\"\">nuts</a> (which have more carbs than you\u2019d think, but are a good source of selenium and fibre).</p> <p>Most of the time, this obsession is fine. And then there are the dark times when I suddenly have to hard-delete every paleo book from my Kindle, only to buy them all again the next day. Or when I go through my Ocado favourites and remove anything not strictly vegan and spend hours creating the \u201cperfect\u201d clean order, only to then cancel the whole thing in the nick of time, just before it leaves the warehouse.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>After one bowl of pasta and a dessert, I had a terrible panic attack. For hours I lay in bed hardly able to breathe</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When I am busy with my writing, happy and distracted by life, I can stay on a mild version of one of my regimes for a few months. But when stressed, I start cycling through the possibilities like an anxious lab rat trying every door to find the one that leads out. I still want so badly to get it right. I want people to stop me in the street and say, \u201cBut you look amazing! And you seem so very, very healthy. What\u2019s your secret?\u201d I know a <em>lot</em> about every single possible answer. But at my worst moments, I have forced myself to believe in completely different paradigms, sometimes all in one day. Not so much <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/apr/04/off-with-their-heads-the-10-greatest-quotes-from-alice-in-wonderland\" title=\"\">believing six impossible things before breakfast</a> as believing six impossible things <em>about</em> breakfast. Could I be a spiritual person while eating meat? Is our time on Earth supposed to be about kindness and the veneration of life, or is it better to accept the natural cycle: that we eat animals and are then returned into the earth to feed them? Was everything I ate in some way wrong?</p> <p>As a fiction writer, it\u2019s my job to wonder about, and dramatise, such things. But that drama has filtered through my life. During a pegan episode, I ended up hungry at a pasta restaurant with a limited menu. After one bowl of pasta and a dessert (well, why not?), I had a terrible panic attack. For countless hours I lay in bed sweating and hardly able to breathe, believing that gluten was attacking my insides, that I would develop an autoimmune disease, schizophrenia and lupus. At other times, I ate meat and fixated on the rotting corpse in my stomach, desperately wanting it out.</p> <p>***</p> <p>The term \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/sep/26/orthorexia-eating-disorder-clean-eating-dsm-miracle-foods\" title=\"\">orthorexia</a>\u201d was coined in 1997 by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2001/sep/09/foodanddrink.features8\" title=\"\">Dr Steven Bratman</a>, author of the leading book on the subject, Health Food Junkies. I don\u2019t have that book any longer: I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/marie-kondo\" title=\"\">Marie Kondo</a>-ed it after it calmly told me that it was possible to die from orthorexia. This did not bring me joy. But it also confirmed that I had been suffering from it for several years. Despite increasing awareness, orthorexia is not listed in the <a href=\"https://icd.who.int/en\" title=\"\">International Classification of Diseases</a>, or in the <a href=\"https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm\" title=\"\">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</a>. However, it has made its way into the Oxford English Dictionary, and is increasingly ingrained in our culture.</p> <p>Orthorexia is an obsession with \u201cpure\u201d or \u201chealthy\u201d food. It is treated as a type of anorexia because sufferers typically reduce their food intake over a period of time, often becoming raw-foodists, \u201cjuicearians\u201d or even \u201csproutarians\u201d. But it doesn\u2019t have to be like that. Sufferers may appear to friends as simply \u201ca bit fussy\u201d or, like me, as \u201chealth-conscious\u201d. And suffering inside doesn\u2019t always show. A friend recently asked me if I (like her) felt like an impostor because I don\u2019t look like someone who has an eating disorder. I knew what she meant. The standard eating disorder recovery \u201clook\u201d on Instagram is willowy and tragic, and I am a size 12-14.</p> <p>In many ways, I don\u2019t even stand out among the people I know. I have two close friends who struggle with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/irritable-bowel-syndrome\" title=\"\">irritable bowel syndrome</a>. In the last two years, one went to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2004/nov/06/shopping5\" title=\"\">a kinesiologist</a> (they are the ones who make you hold a food item; if you feel weak, you are allergic to it), while the other had parasitic hookworms injected into her arm. Another close friend is low-carbing to combat her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/polycystic-ovary-syndrome\" title=\"\">polycystic ovary syndrome</a>, and another is on keto for his arthritis. We have all become persuaded we can self-medicate through food, and maybe this is even true. My friends are all neurotic, but they glow with health.</p> <p>Whenever I sit down for dinner with my editor, we compare regimes. \u201cLand animals,\u201d he said last time, explaining what was taboo for him at that moment. \u201cAnd dairy.\u201d Another friend moves between low-GI, low-carb and fasting. We have both been doing 16:8, where you fast for 16 hours of every 24, for ages. We send each other pictures of sticks we have peed on to see if we are in ketosis, the point at which the body starts breaking fat down. Another friend is on the warrior diet, which involves eating one big meal a day. We all have proper jobs in health, publishing or the arts.</p> <p>When I tell people I am recovering from an eating disorder called orthorexia, they usually mishear it as \u201cauthorexia\u201d, and perhaps, for me, that\u2019s what it is: an eating disorder based around storytelling. An eating disorder for authors, or at least encouraged by them. One macrobiotic writer suggests listening to Shakespeare if you have heart trouble, because the iambic pentameter will stabilise you. When it comes to the diet books, the different regimes, it is always the stories that do it: the familiar, comforting narrative arc of the lost soul who discovers the secret that leads to health, purity and beauty. The brave, bold young American who finds the truth that eluded his parents. The fat-adapted ultramarathon runners who do it all on a spoonful of coconut oil. </p> <p>***</p> <p>After my 1999 solar eclipse weight crisis, I bought two books about food combining in a Dartmouth bookshop. Before that, I\u2019d rarely seen a diet book. When I was growing up, our house was full of books, but not that kind. After all, wasn\u2019t dieting one of those twee things oppressed women did in the 50s because the patriarchy said they should?</p> <p>The food-combining books didn\u2019t just tell me not to eat protein and carbs together, advice I have tried to follow ever since (I still feel guilty when I fail). They told me what would happen if I did: along with indigestion and arthritis, I might get candida, anxiety, depression, IBS and chronic fatigue. One chapter was titled How Toxic Are You? The symptoms included being bored, tired, having aches and pains, few ideas and poor concentration. This was me! (And, of course, every writer I knew.) How lucky I\u2019d found these books before I died of literally everything. But there were the success stories, too, and these became what I craved. Stories of people being brought back from the brink, people who had almost died and then been cured by avocado cream.</p> <p>I bought more books, which could be unintentionally funny, too. One favourite talked knowledgably about the behaviour of animals in the wild. \u201cWhen that lion ate the zebra, it wasn\u2019t having a baked potato with it,\u201d it pointed out. But, of course, I was not a lion. I was following all the instructions, but not losing any weight. In fact, I was putting weight <em>on</em>.</p> <p>If I was not a lion, I wondered, what was I? A caveperson, came back the answer. A human with a genetic code that has not fundamentally changed for 10,000 years and whose system simply cannot compute \u201cHaribo\u201d or \u201cbagel\u201d. At first I ruled out \u201cancestral\u201d diets because of all the meat, but <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-vegetarian-low-carb-diet-9780749926496.html\" title=\"\">Rose Elliot\u2019s vegetarian low-carb book</a> became the gateway that culminated a couple of years later in Wolf\u2019s Paleo Solution. There were heady days of fried halloumi and eggs and mushrooms in butter, bowls of berries and cream. I loved the food, and most of my How Toxic Are You? symptoms went. I stopped feeling nervous all the time. But I didn\u2019t lose any weight, so I went vegan again.</p> <p>For the next few years I swung between extremes so frequently that from a distance I might have appeared moderate. My weight increased until it hit 11st (70kg), and then refused to budge. On the outside I looked like a M-L person, a Topshop size 14, able to fit into 30in-waist jeans from anywhere but All Saints. Inside, I was suffering all the time. Pictures taken at literary festivals showed me with a double chin and flabby arms, looming over a lectern like <a href=\"https://www.starwars.com/databank/jabba-the-hutt\" title=\"\">Jabba the Hutt</a>. Me! In my head I still looked like <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=kate+moss+in+the+90s&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZq5fqpqPlAhUXiFwKHZxkDqMQ_AUIEigB&amp;biw=1686&amp;bih=1014\" title=\"\">Kate Moss in the </a><a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=kate+moss+in+the+90s&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZq5fqpqPlAhUXiFwKHZxkDqMQ_AUIEigB&amp;biw=1686&amp;bih=1014\" title=\"\">90s</a>.</p> <p>I started looking for clues about what other women ate: the ones who still have flat stomachs in their 40s, who still look like pictures in magazines and who don\u2019t seem to use three filters at once on Instagram (like I do). I am ashamed to say that when I spotted <a href=\"https://www.edbookfest.co.uk/media-gallery/photo-gallery/2019-book-festival-highlights?photo_id=2378\" title=\"\">Arundhati Roy</a> looking glowing in a hotel restaurant at the Edinburgh International Book Festival this year, I watched to see what she ate, and was disappointed by a cappuccino. (But was it soya, almond or cow\u2019s milk?) Enabled by a world that is still fixated on women\u2019s bodies, on slow days I would do online research to determine which of my regimes actually worked on other people. The fact that they\u2019d failed to work on me was my fault, not the fault of the diet, of course.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is unlikely I will ever be able to get out of my head all the stories I believe about food and illness</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><em>Had</em> they failed? Perhaps I sound mentally unstable, but physically I am as strong as an ox. Whenever I am ill \u2013 which, perhaps due to all the kale and vitamins, is very rarely \u2013 I think back to the last thing I ate and blame it on that. But could it be that these \u201chealthy\u201d diets actually work? Maybe I am meant to be a size 12-14 person who gets one (if that) cold a year. Of course I am constantly on guard against any sort of illness, ready at all times with my turmeric and green tea and manuka honey. And I don\u2019t want to admit I feel healthy in case I tempt fate and am diagnosed with an incurable disease.</p> <p>I\u2019d love to say that all this is in the past, but it is unlikely I will ever be able to get out of my head all the stories I believe about food and illness. In that sense, I\u2019ll be authorexic for ever, even if at times I have got my orthorexia more or less under control. I spend most of my time now on a lowish carb diet simply because it makes me feel better mentally and comes with less plastic packaging, and I\u2019ve almost, but not quite, come to terms with my size and shape. But I can still be easily triggered: a column on being vegan for the environment can turn me for a week or two; coverage of the health benefits of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/sep/12/tom-watson-lost-seven-stone-reversed-type-2-diabetes-interview\" title=\"\">Tom Watson\u2019s keto diet</a> will exert an influence. If I had seen Roy\u2019s breakfast, I would have adopted it.</p> <p>Meanwhile, my Instagram heaves with body positivity. I love <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lizzobeeating/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Lizzo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ashleygraham/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Ashley Graham</a>, and all the many muscly heroines of <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/Crossfit/\" title=\"\">CrossFit</a>. But they are young and beautiful, and I am 47. They are naturally glorious, while I still need help. I just don\u2019t have that jawline \u2013 though a part of me thinks that there is a diet to fix that. One of my favourite new books is about <a href=\"https://www.intuitiveeating.org/\" title=\"\">intuitive eating</a>, where you eat what you want (yes, including Big Macs and Twirls) on the basis that your body will eventually ask only for what it needs. As one of my friends despairingly asked, \u201cHow is that even possible?\u201d</p> <p>Last week I was in the supermarket trying to decide between organic brazil nuts and nonorganic pistachio nuts (this is close to my natural state) when I became aware of two teenage girls in the same aisle. They were browsing the \u201cFree From\u201d foods. They looked perfectly healthy and robust: everything you should be at 15. They were surrounded, as I was, by abundance: cheap, plentiful food. \u201cLet\u2019s get some gluten-free stuff,\u201d one said to the other. \u201cApparently it helps you lose weight.\u201d I wanted to interrupt, to say something to them, but what? That it\u2019s not true, and all that gluten-free stuff is just full of sugar? That they really don\u2019t need to lose any weight? What would I have told my younger self, before I embarked on my orthorexic journey? I don\u2019t honestly know. So I chose the brazil nuts and left, hoping they would simply grow out of it, but knowing, given the size and power of the wellness industry, with all its compelling stories, that they probably won\u2019t.</p> <p>\u2022 Oligarchy, a novel by Scarlett Thomas, is published on 7 November (Canongate, \u00a314.99).

But when stressed, I start cycling through the possibilities like an anxious lab rat trying every door to find the one that leads out. I still want so badly to get it right. I want people to stop me in the street and say, \u201cBut you look amazing! And you seem so very, very healthy. What\u2019s your secret?\u201d I know a lot about every single possible answer. But at my worst moments, I have forced myself to believe in completely different paradigms, sometimes all in one day. Not so much believing six impossible things before breakfast as believing six impossible things about breakfast. Could I be a spiritual person while eating meat? Is our time on Earth supposed to be about kindness and the veneration of life, or is it better to accept the natural cycle: that we eat animals and are then returned into the earth to feed them? Was everything I ate in some way wrong? As a fiction writer, it\u2019s my job to wonder about, and dramatise, such things. But that drama has filtered through my life. During a pegan episode, I ended up hungry at a pasta restaurant with a limited menu. After one bowl of pasta and a dessert (well, why not?), I had a terrible panic attack. For countless hours I lay in bed sweating and hardly able to breathe, believing that gluten was attacking my insides, that I would develop an autoimmune disease, schizophrenia and lupus. At other times, I ate meat and fixated on the rotting corpse in my stomach, desperately wanting it out. *** The term \u201corthorexia\u201d was coined in 1997 by Dr Steven Bratman, author of the leading book on the subject, Health Food Junkies. I don\u2019t have that book any longer: I Marie Kondo-ed it after it calmly told me that it was possible to die from orthorexia. This did not bring me joy. But it also confirmed that I had been suffering from it for several years. Despite increasing awareness, orthorexia is not listed in the International Classification of Diseases, or in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. However, it has made its way into the Oxford English Dictionary, and is increasingly ingrained in our culture. Orthorexia is an obsession with \u201cpure\u201d or \u201chealthy\u201d food. It is treated as a type of anorexia because sufferers typically reduce their food intake over a period of time, often becoming raw-foodists, \u201cjuicearians\u201d or even \u201csproutarians\u201d. But it doesn\u2019t have to be like that. Sufferers may appear to friends as simply \u201ca bit fussy\u201d or, like me, as \u201chealth-conscious\u201d. And suffering inside doesn\u2019t always show. A friend recently asked me if I (like her) felt like an impostor because I don\u2019t look like someone who has an eating disorder. I knew what she meant. The standard eating disorder recovery \u201clook\u201d on Instagram is willowy and tragic, and I am a size 12-14. In many ways, I don\u2019t even stand out among the people I know. I have two close friends who struggle with irritable bowel syndrome. In the last two years, one went to a kinesiologist (they are the ones who make you hold a food item; if you feel weak, you are allergic to it), while the other had parasitic hookworms injected into her arm. Another close friend is low-carbing to combat her polycystic ovary syndrome, and another is on keto for his arthritis. We have all become persuaded we can self-medicate through food, and maybe this is even true. My friends are all neurotic, but they glow with health. Whenever I sit down for dinner with my editor, we compare regimes. \u201cLand animals,\u201d he said last time, explaining what was taboo for him at that moment. \u201cAnd dairy.\u201d Another friend moves between low-GI, low-carb and fasting. We have both been doing 16:8, where you fast for 16 hours of every 24, for ages. We send each other pictures of sticks we have peed on to see if we are in ketosis, the point at which the body starts breaking fat down. Another friend is on the warrior diet, which involves eating one big meal a day. We all have proper jobs in health, publishing or the arts. When I tell people I am recovering from an eating disorder called orthorexia, they usually mishear it as \u201cauthorexia\u201d, and perhaps, for me, that\u2019s what it is: an eating disorder based around storytelling. An eating disorder for authors, or at least encouraged by them. One macrobiotic writer suggests listening to Shakespeare if you have heart trouble, because the iambic pentameter will stabilise you. When it comes to the diet books, the different regimes, it is always the stories that do it: the familiar, comforting narrative arc of the lost soul who discovers the secret that leads to health, purity and beauty. The brave, bold young American who finds the truth that eluded his parents. The fat-adapted ultramarathon runners who do it all on a spoonful of coconut oil. *** After my 1999 solar eclipse weight crisis, I bought two books about food combining in a Dartmouth bookshop. Before that, I\u2019d rarely seen a diet book. When I was growing up, our house was full of books, but not that kind. After all, wasn\u2019t dieting one of those twee things oppressed women did in the 50s because the patriarchy said they should? The food-combining books didn\u2019t just tell me not to eat protein and carbs together, advice I have tried to follow ever since (I still feel guilty when I fail). They told me what would happen if I did: along with indigestion and arthritis, I might get candida, anxiety, depression, IBS and chronic fatigue. One chapter was titled How Toxic Are You? The symptoms included being bored, tired, having aches and pains, few ideas and poor concentration. This was me! (And, of course, every writer I knew.) How lucky I\u2019d found these books before I died of literally everything. But there were the success stories, too, and these became what I craved. Stories of people being brought back from the brink, people who had almost died and then been cured by avocado cream. I bought more books, which could be unintentionally funny, too. One favourite talked knowledgably about the behaviour of animals in the wild. \u201cWhen that lion ate the zebra, it wasn\u2019t having a baked potato with it,\u201d it pointed out. But, of course, I was not a lion. I was following all the instructions, but not losing any weight. In fact, I was putting weight on. If I was not a lion, I wondered, what was I? A caveperson, came back the answer. A human with a genetic code that has not fundamentally changed for 10,000 years and whose system simply cannot compute \u201cHaribo\u201d or \u201cbagel\u201d. At first I ruled out \u201cancestral\u201d diets because of all the meat, but Rose Elliot\u2019s vegetarian low-carb book became the gateway that culminated a couple of years later in Wolf\u2019s Paleo Solution. There were heady days of fried halloumi and eggs and mushrooms in butter, bowls of berries and cream. I loved the food, and most of my How Toxic Are You? symptoms went. I stopped feeling nervous all the time. But I didn\u2019t lose any weight, so I went vegan again. For the next few years I swung between extremes so frequently that from a distance I might have appeared moderate. My weight increased until it hit 11st (70kg), and then refused to budge. On the outside I looked like a M-L person, a Topshop size 14, able to fit into 30in-waist jeans from anywhere but All Saints. Inside, I was suffering all the time. Pictures taken at literary festivals showed me with a double chin and flabby arms, looming over a lectern like Jabba the Hutt. Me! In my head I still looked like Kate Moss in the 90s. I started looking for clues about what other women ate: the ones who still have flat stomachs in their 40s, who still look like pictures in magazines and who don\u2019t seem to use three filters at once on Instagram (like I do). I am ashamed to say that when I spotted Arundhati Roy looking glowing in a hotel restaurant at the Edinburgh International Book Festival this year, I watched to see what she ate, and was disappointed by a cappuccino. (But was it soya, almond or cow\u2019s milk?) Enabled by a world that is still fixated on women\u2019s bodies, on slow days I would do online research to determine which of my regimes actually worked on other people. The fact that they\u2019d failed to work on me was my fault, not the fault of the diet, of course. Had they failed? Perhaps I sound mentally unstable, but physically I am as strong as an ox. Whenever I am ill \u2013 which, perhaps due to all the kale and vitamins, is very rarely \u2013 I think back to the last thing I ate and blame it on that. But could it be that these \u201chealthy\u201d diets actually work? Maybe I am meant to be a size 12-14 person who gets one (if that) cold a year. Of course I am constantly on guard against any sort of illness, ready at all times with my turmeric and green tea and manuka honey. And I don\u2019t want to admit I feel healthy in case I tempt fate and am diagnosed with an incurable disease. I\u2019d love to say that all this is in the past, but it is unlikely I will ever be able to get out of my head all the stories I believe about food and illness. In that sense, I\u2019ll be authorexic for ever, even if at times I have got my orthorexia more or less under control. I spend most of my time now on a lowish carb diet simply because it makes me feel better mentally and comes with less plastic packaging, and I\u2019ve almost, but not quite, come to terms with my size and shape. But I can still be easily triggered: a column on being vegan for the environment can turn me for a week or two; coverage of the health benefits of Tom Watson\u2019s keto diet will exert an influence. If I had seen Roy\u2019s breakfast, I would have adopted it. Meanwhile, my Instagram heaves with body positivity. I love Lizzo and Ashley Graham, and all the many muscly heroines of CrossFit. But they are young and beautiful, and I am 47. They are naturally glorious, while I still need help. I just don\u2019t have that jawline \u2013 though a part of me thinks that there is a diet to fix that. One of my favourite new books is about intuitive eating, where you eat what you want (yes, including Big Macs and Twirls) on the basis that your body will eventually ask only for what it needs. As one of my friends despairingly asked, \u201cHow is that even possible?\u201d Last week I was in the supermarket trying to decide between organic brazil nuts and nonorganic pistachio nuts (this is close to my natural state) when I became aware of two teenage girls in the same aisle. They were browsing the \u201cFree From\u201d foods. They looked perfectly healthy and robust: everything you should be at 15. They were surrounded, as I was, by abundance: cheap, plentiful food. \u201cLet\u2019s get some gluten-free stuff,\u201d one said to the other. \u201cApparently it helps you lose weight.\u201d I wanted to interrupt, to say something to them, but what? That it\u2019s not true, and all that gluten-free stuff is just full of sugar? That they really don\u2019t need to lose any weight? What would I have told my younger self, before I embarked on my orthorexic journey? I don\u2019t honestly know. So I chose the brazil nuts and left, hoping they would simply grow out of it, but knowing, given the size and power of the wellness industry, with all its compelling stories, that they probably won\u2019t. \u2022 Oligarchy, a novel by Scarlett Thomas, is published on 7 November (Canongate, \u00a314.99).

He says: \u201cWhat we\u2019re teaching here is exactly the same techniques as at the ocean, from popping up, to currents, to line-up situations, but here we can turn around and look back at exactly the same waves and reassess things. It\u2019s an amazing pathway for learning.\u201d</p> <p>The lagoon is filled with drinking-quality water, and when I dip my toes in I\u2019m glad I heeded his advice to wear a 5mm wetsuit and booties (included in the admission fee, along with boards).

Suddenly, the lagoon is no longer my nemesis.</p> <p>The idea of building a surfing lake in Bristol came to The Wave\u2019s founder, Nick Hounsfield, an osteopath and lifelong surfer, in 2011. He wanted to \u201ccreate a health and wellbeing destination that was safe and cohesive\u201d, open to people who might often feel excluded through \u201cdisability, illness, age, gender, background, income, fears\u201d.</p> <p>He contacted <a href=\"https://wavegarden.com/\" title=\"\">Basque firm</a><a href=\"https://wavegarden.com/\" title=\"\"> Wave</a><a href=\"https://wavegarden.com/\" title=\"\">garden</a>, but saw their initial designs, used at <a href=\"https://adventureparcsnowdonia.com/surf-snowdonia/\" title=\"\">Surf Snowdonia in Wales</a>, the UK\u2019s first artificial surfing lake, run into issues early on. Luckily, Wavegarden fashioned a new concept. \u201cSnowdonia is powered by an underwater foil, so when they have problems they have to drain the lake,\u201d says Nick. \u201cWe\u2019ve got 40 paddles which slide forwards and backwards on a simple rack and pinion system. It\u2019s basic engineering.

      "bodyText": "\u2018Yeee-eew!\u2019 cries my coach, Oliver, as we near the water\u2019s edge. Wave after wave surges towards us, peeling sideways before crumbling at our feet. No closeouts, no guessing where waves will break, just perfect peaks stretching into the distance. Most surfers would be stoked to see this at any beach in the world, but I\u2019m eight miles from Bristol\u2019s centre and three from the English \u201ccoast\u201d (if you can call the muddy Severn estuary that) at a man-made surfing venue that opens on 26 October. This \u00a326m project, called The Wave, features a vast, cove-shaped lagoon which can produce up to 1,000 waves per hour, from whitewater for beginners to 1.8-metre barrelling sections for elite surfers. There\u2019s a wooden-clad ops building with changing, dining and viewing facilities, created with accessibility and sustainability in mind. Beyond it, meadowlands and camping plots are under construction. \u201cIt\u2019s the kind of stuff you dream about as a kid,\u201d Oliver says with awe. \u201cI think I used to scribble drawings of this.\u201d As a self-taught surfer of limited skill, I\u2019ve signed up for a 90-minute intermediate lesson \u2013 hardly enough time to unpick five years of bad habits. After a warm-up, Oliver introduces me to my board: a large, lime green \u201cfoamie\u201d. He says: \u201cWhat we\u2019re teaching here is exactly the same techniques as at the ocean, from popping up, to currents, to line-up situations, but here we can turn around and look back at exactly the same waves and reassess things. It\u2019s an amazing pathway for learning.\u201d The lagoon is filled with drinking-quality water, and when I dip my toes in I\u2019m glad I heeded his advice to wear a 5mm wetsuit and booties (included in the admission fee, along with boards). Within a minute, Oliver is pushing me into my first wave. \u201cThat was perfect,\u201d he says, almost apologetically, as I pop up and ride through the whitewater. My performance nosedives thereafter \u2013 figuratively and literally \u2013 and the next 30 minutes feel like a one-man audition for kook of the day. Oliver remains upbeat, adjusting my stance and guiding me into waves with encouragement. Then comes a lightbulb moment: \u201cYou have to think about coming through, not popping up explosively,\u201d he says. Suddenly, the lagoon is no longer my nemesis. The idea of building a surfing lake in Bristol came to The Wave\u2019s founder, Nick Hounsfield, an osteopath and lifelong surfer, in 2011. He wanted to \u201ccreate a health and wellbeing destination that was safe and cohesive\u201d, open to people who might often feel excluded through \u201cdisability, illness, age, gender, background, income, fears\u201d. He contacted Basque firm Wavegarden, but saw their initial designs, used at Surf Snowdonia in Wales, the UK\u2019s first artificial surfing lake, run into issues early on. Luckily, Wavegarden fashioned a new concept. \u201cSnowdonia is powered by an underwater foil, so when they have problems they have to drain the lake,\u201d says Nick. \u201cWe\u2019ve got 40 paddles which slide forwards and backwards on a simple rack and pinion system. It\u2019s basic engineering. A computer co-ordinates those paddles, and the lake bed is sculpted like an ocean reef to create different types of waves.\u201d The 70 acres of former agricultural land a short distance from the M5 are highly accessible but removed from the bustle of Bristol. They hope to attract around 150,000 visitors per year and are already planning another venue in London\u2019s Lee Valley. \u201cIf you close your eyes, it sounds just like the ocean out here,\u201d says Nick. \u201cBut oh my goodness, it\u2019s waves on tap.\u201d Having surfed at Snowdonia last year, I can\u2019t tell the difference, but the advanced surfers I meet are beaming. \u201cI had a blast, people are going to love it,\u201d says board-shaper and Wave ambassador Ben Skinner. The technology allows elite surfers to practise where the biggest waves are generated, while beginners can learn in the safety of the shallows, as they would at a natural beach. What is hugely noticeable is the sense of camaraderie. With up to 80 surfers of differing abilities in the lagoon at any one time \u2013 grouped by ability and overseen by \u201chosts\u201d and coaches (there\u2019s one for every eight people in the beginners\u2019 section) \u2013 you\u2019re more likely to have \u201crival\u201d surfers praise your takeoff than snake your wave. At the end of my session, I convince my coach to let me try the advanced waves. \u201cThis is my defining moment,\u201d I joke. \u201cNo, don\u2019t put that pressure on yourself; it\u2019s just another wave,\u201d Oliver replies. The lagoon is empty and I feel the eyes of a dozen spectators on me. \u201cPaddle, paddle, paddle,\u201d Oliver yells. I pop up fairly smoothly before wrestling my way to the shore.

      "bodyText": "How many black families have been targeted by undercover police officers? This is the simple question we are still waiting for authorities to answer. More than five years have passed since Theresa May, then the home secretary, announced a public inquiry following \u201cprofoundly shocking\u201d evidence that Met police undercover officers had spied on the grieving parents of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence, as well as their campaign to get justice for their son. Despite Sir John Mitting\u2019s ongoing undercover policing inquiry spending \u00a321m since 2015, public hearings will only commence in the summer of 2020. In July, however, the inquiry did finally manage to publish the fake identity of a black undercover police officer, \u201cAnthony Lewis\u201d, who gathered intelligence on the Lawrences and their supporters. \u201cLewis\u201d, like a number of other undercover officers, has admitted he deceived a woman into a long-term relationship while using his fake identity. The exposure of this kind of abusive manipulation has forced senior officers to publicly apologise to other women who were targeted in this way. What we still do not know, however, is how many other campaigns like the Lawrences\u2019, led by grieving families and friends seeking justice for their loved ones after a racist murder or a death in police custody, were targeted? Five years ago the police said there were 18 such groups and families, but no full list of those spied on has ever been published \u2013 although they said \u201cthe majority\u201d were black. One of the groups that fought for justice for bereaved families was Newham Monitoring Project (NMP), based in east London, which I was an active campaigner with from 1990 \u2013 until it was forced to close due to a lack of funds in 2015. Its focus was on providing practical and legal support to victims of racist violence and the oppressive policing of black communities in east London. Over that period, NMP helped to organise and support numerous campaigns. This included work with the Tamil family of Panchadcharam Sahitharan, who was murdered in Newham in 1992; the death in police custody of Shiji Lapite in Hackney in 1994; Ibrahima Sey\u2019s death in Ilford police station in 1996; all the way through to the aftermath of the killing of Jean Charles de Menezes by armed officers at Stockwell police station in 2005 \u2013 and the legal battle that followed. Just as the families we supported were spied on, the police have subsequently confirmed that NMP, too, was monitored \u2013 even though our important work was funded by the local council and the National Lottery. Why was so much police work put towards spying on the bereaved and their supporters? We are convinced that political policing units and their masters were primarily motivated by a desire to protect the Met\u2019s already damaged reputation: they did so by deliberately trying to portray campaigns seeking truth and accountability as a potential cause of public disorder. This is, unquestionably in our view, a consequence of the police\u2019s institutionally racist attitude to the \u201cthreat\u201d posed by racialised communities in the UK. Unfortunately, although some family justice campaigners have been accepted by the undercover policing inquiry as \u201ccore participants\u201d in its deliberations, others have not. Instead, they must wait until the inquiry says it finds evidence of spying at a later stage. Most of these campaigners still have no further information. Despite Mitting\u2019s inquiry saying that more than 1,000 groups were targeted, we still have no idea of the true scale of covert intelligence-gathering on black justice campaigns. This is why the organisation I work for, the Network for Police Monitoring (Netpol) \u2013 founded a decade ago by groups including NMP \u2013 is launching a campaign with the Undercover Research Group to investigate the question the inquiry refuses to answer: how many black families were targeted by undercover officers? This new investigation aims to expand on work undertaken by the Undercover Research Group last year with the Guardian, which resulted in the publishing of a list of \u201cspycops\u201d targets. Almost all of these family justice campaigns no longer exist, and so we are hoping that people who once organised or participated in them will get in touch and help us expand on public knowledge of police surveillance on their activities. The annual remembrance procession led by the family and friends of those who have died in the custody of police and prison officers takes place in central London on Saturday. Unfortunately, over the last five years it has becoming increasingly clear that the transparency and fairness we all want is unlikely to come from the inquiry or the police \u2013 unless we push for answers ourselves. \u2022 Kevin Blowe is coordinator of the Network for Police Monitoring (Netpol) If you can help, please contact researcher Eveline Lubbers at the Undercover Research Group in confidence at evel@undercoverresearch.net",

      "body": "<p>People who were there remember Alan Pardew\u2019s disbelief quickly turning into ecstasy. It was August 2006, almost four months after Pardew\u2019s young West Ham side had come within a whisker of beating Liverpool in the FA Cup final, and the final day of the transfer window was about to take a turn for the surreal in east London.</p> <p>At first it seemed like a prank, the idea that two of the hottest talents in South America were about to join West Ham, and Pardew\u2019s response was predictable when the idea was put to him. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s never going to happen.\u201d Only, it was. One of the most controversial transfers in the history of English football progressed at dizzying speed and by the end of the day Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano had left the S\u00e3o Paulo club Corinthians for West Ham.</p> <p>\u201cI remember watching it on Sky Sports News,\u201d Matthew Etherington, who played for West Ham between 2003 and 2009, says. \u201cNone of us expected it. We thought: \u2018Maybe this is the way the club\u2019s going.\u2019 We didn\u2019t know how the deal was structured at the time.\u201d</p> <p>Sheffield United, who visit the London Stadium on Saturday afternoon, have not forgotten. They have faced West Ham once since the bitter row over the Mascherano and Tevez deal, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/aug/26/sheffield-united-west-ham-penalties\" title=\"\">winning a League Cup tie at Upton Park in August 2014</a>, and have not forgotten an independent Premier League commission handing the east London club a record \u00a35.5m fine instead of a points deduction for breaking third-party ownership rules when they signed the Argentinian duo.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"42c8920e9943ef6820add98bf9b805aad668c53a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42c8920e9943ef6820add98bf9b805aad668c53a/0_67_3416_2050/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u201cMascherano was brilliant in training, Tevez took some time to adjust to life in London.

Far from helping them challenge the elite, signing Tevez and Mascherano almost got them relegated, caused long-term financial problems and disturbed dressing-room harmony. Mascherano played seven forgettable games before joining Liverpool during the January window and it took Tevez 1,142 minutes to score a goal.</p> <p>It was one of the strangest seasons in West Ham\u2019s history. Pardew had won the Championship play-offs in 2005 and for a while he was the perfect leader for a youthful, boisterous group. If Bobby Zamora arrived early to nick the manager\u2019s parking space at the training ground, it was seen as part of the fun. After a while, however, off-field issues began to affect the squad\u2019s discipline.</p> <p>West Ham enjoyed their first season back in the Premier League, finishing ninth and reaching the FA Cup final. Their hearts would be broken by Steven Gerrard\u2019s last-minute equaliser for Liverpool, who won it on penalties. \u201cIt took a lot out of everybody,\u201d Etherington says.</p> <p>Nothing was the same after Gerrard\u2019s thunderbolt. Dean Ashton, the team\u2019s best striker, broke an ankle shortly before the season started and some players had grown cocky. There were doubts over Nigel Reo-Coker\u2019s attitude after stories linking the midfielder with Arsenal and Manchester United. He was pally with Anton Ferdinand, Hayden Mullins, Marlon Harewood and Zamora, all of whom had been central to the side\u2019s rise. When Tevez and Mascherano arrived, the latter tookMullins\u2019s place in midfield. \u201cHayden definitely didn\u2019t react in a negative way but it did upset the apple cart at the time,\u201d Etherington says. \u201cIt was a good, young team with a sprinkling of experience and quality. Were two high-profile signings like that needed?\u201d</p> <p>The so-called economic rights of Tevez and Mascherano were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/oct/05/sportfeatures.westhamunited\" title=\"\">owned by four companies represented by Kia Joorabchian</a>, who was expected to buy West Ham. A belief grew that Tevez and Mascherano were anticipating a change of manager. Pardew had been fatally undermined and the team knew it. Teddy Sheringham, one of West Ham\u2019s few experienced players, privately remarked that they were in trouble.</p> <p>Results nosedived. West Ham went out of the Uefa Cup in the first round and were knocked out of the League Cup by Chesterfield. As for the Argentinians, Tevez was unfit and out of his comfort zone in a new country, while Mascherano was struggling with the pace of the Premier League. \u201cMascherano was brilliant in training,\u201d Etherington says. \u201cTevez took some time to adjust to life in London. In training he didn\u2019t seem that dedicated. Mascherano adjusted really well. He was doing English lessons from day one. Tevez just had an interpreter with him all the time. He had no interest at the time to bed into the culture.\u201d</p> <p>Tevez was actually doing extra drills with Zamora after training but the situation showed no sign of improving. Chances went begging and he became so frustrated that he stormed out of Upton Park after being substituted during a win over Sheffield United. Pardew let the rest of the squad decide Tevez\u2019s punishment: they made him train in a Brazil shirt.</p> <p>An \u00a385m takeover had been completed by then \u2013 but not by Joorabchian. Terry Brown had sold up to Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson, an Icelandic billionaire who installed Eggert Magnusson as chairman. </p> <p>On 3 December Mascherano made his final appearance for West Ham, coming on in the 84th minute of a 2-0 defeat at Everton. He was at fault for the second goal, summing up his time at the club.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d24c834657e2c009fe903e38388cdbd6b45f174\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d24c834657e2c009fe903e38388cdbd6b45f174/0_29_2259_1355/1000.jpg\" alt=\"West Ham were in the driving seat on the final day of the season and they who stole a win when Carlos Tevez clipped home on the stroke of half-time.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">West Ham were in the driving seat on the final day of the season and they who stole a win when Carlos Tevez clipped home on the stroke of half-time.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Three days later West Ham were beaten at home by Wigan Athletic, after which Pardew was called into Magnusson\u2019s office and told that the board were fully behind him. Yet Pardew\u2019s charm had worn off and he was sacked within a week, a 4-0 loss at Bolton proving the final straw. \u201cI texted Pardew and said I felt the players had let him down,\u201d Etherington says. \u201cWe lost our way and I felt the players had a lot to do with that, not so much the manager. People believed their own hype. We took our eye off the ball, me included.\u201d</p> <p>Gudmundsson was rarely seen at Upton Park but Magnusson was panicking. He appointed Alan Curbishley, an experienced pragmatist. The former Charlton manager had an unforgettable first game, beating the eventual champions, Manchester United, at Upton Park, but it was a temporary high.</p> <p>West Ham followed the win with three draws and nine defeats. Curbishley, who was reluctant to use Tevez at first, was aghast at his squad\u2019s attitude. There was talk of a gambling culture within the club. \u201cWe were probably enjoying ourselves a bit too much,\u201d one former player admits.</p> <p>Curbishley ripped into his players after<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/jan/02/match.sport2\" title=\"\"> a 6-0 defeat at Reading on New Year\u2019s Day</a>, criticising their flash lifestyles and fast cars, which led to them being dubbed the Baby Bentley brigade. \u201cHe was very forthright, which sometimes isn\u2019t the best thing to do,\u201d Etherington adds. \u201cHe called players out. It was a bold move. Was it right? I\u2019d say no but eventually we got our act together.\u201d</p> <p>Curbishley spent in January, signing Luis Boa Morte, Calum Davenport, Lucas Neill, Nigel Quashie and Matthew Upson. Kepa Blanco also joined on loan from Sevilla. Upson had dropped everything to join West Ham from Birmingham on deadline day. The centre-back did not even have his boots with him. His agent had to buy a pair from a shop near Upton Park. No wonder Upson limped off on his debut, a 1-0 defeat by Aston Villa.

      "bodyText": "People who were there remember Alan Pardew\u2019s disbelief quickly turning into ecstasy. It was August 2006, almost four months after Pardew\u2019s young West Ham side had come within a whisker of beating Liverpool in the FA Cup final, and the final day of the transfer window was about to take a turn for the surreal in east London. At first it seemed like a prank, the idea that two of the hottest talents in South America were about to join West Ham, and Pardew\u2019s response was predictable when the idea was put to him. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s never going to happen.\u201d Only, it was. One of the most controversial transfers in the history of English football progressed at dizzying speed and by the end of the day Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano had left the S\u00e3o Paulo club Corinthians for West Ham. \u201cI remember watching it on Sky Sports News,\u201d Matthew Etherington, who played for West Ham between 2003 and 2009, says. \u201cNone of us expected it. We thought: \u2018Maybe this is the way the club\u2019s going.\u2019 We didn\u2019t know how the deal was structured at the time.\u201d Sheffield United, who visit the London Stadium on Saturday afternoon, have not forgotten. They have faced West Ham once since the bitter row over the Mascherano and Tevez deal, winning a League Cup tie at Upton Park in August 2014, and have not forgotten an independent Premier League commission handing the east London club a record \u00a35.5m fine instead of a points deduction for breaking third-party ownership rules when they signed the Argentinian duo. An FA tribunal would later find in United\u2019s favour, arguing that Tevez\u2019s role was crucial in West Ham staying up, and the Hammers ended up paying the Blades \u00a320m in compensation following an out-of-court settlement. However, while the coverage down the years has largely focused on United being cheated out of a Premier League place, something lost in the conversation is how West Ham\u2019s dream turned into a nightmare. Far from helping them challenge the elite, signing Tevez and Mascherano almost got them relegated, caused long-term financial problems and disturbed dressing-room harmony. Mascherano played seven forgettable games before joining Liverpool during the January window and it took Tevez 1,142 minutes to score a goal. It was one of the strangest seasons in West Ham\u2019s history. Pardew had won the Championship play-offs in 2005 and for a while he was the perfect leader for a youthful, boisterous group. If Bobby Zamora arrived early to nick the manager\u2019s parking space at the training ground, it was seen as part of the fun. After a while, however, off-field issues began to affect the squad\u2019s discipline. West Ham enjoyed their first season back in the Premier League, finishing ninth and reaching the FA Cup final. Their hearts would be broken by Steven Gerrard\u2019s last-minute equaliser for Liverpool, who won it on penalties. \u201cIt took a lot out of everybody,\u201d Etherington says. Nothing was the same after Gerrard\u2019s thunderbolt. Dean Ashton, the team\u2019s best striker, broke an ankle shortly before the season started and some players had grown cocky. There were doubts over Nigel Reo-Coker\u2019s attitude after stories linking the midfielder with Arsenal and Manchester United. He was pally with Anton Ferdinand, Hayden Mullins, Marlon Harewood and Zamora, all of whom had been central to the side\u2019s rise. When Tevez and Mascherano arrived, the latter tookMullins\u2019s place in midfield. \u201cHayden definitely didn\u2019t react in a negative way but it did upset the apple cart at the time,\u201d Etherington says. \u201cIt was a good, young team with a sprinkling of experience and quality. Were two high-profile signings like that needed?\u201d The so-called economic rights of Tevez and Mascherano were owned by four companies represented by Kia Joorabchian, who was expected to buy West Ham. A belief grew that Tevez and Mascherano were anticipating a change of manager. Pardew had been fatally undermined and the team knew it. Teddy Sheringham, one of West Ham\u2019s few experienced players, privately remarked that they were in trouble. Results nosedived. West Ham went out of the Uefa Cup in the first round and were knocked out of the League Cup by Chesterfield. As for the Argentinians, Tevez was unfit and out of his comfort zone in a new country, while Mascherano was struggling with the pace of the Premier League. \u201cMascherano was brilliant in training,\u201d Etherington says. \u201cTevez took some time to adjust to life in London. In training he didn\u2019t seem that dedicated. Mascherano adjusted really well. He was doing English lessons from day one. Tevez just had an interpreter with him all the time. He had no interest at the time to bed into the culture.\u201d Tevez was actually doing extra drills with Zamora after training but the situation showed no sign of improving. Chances went begging and he became so frustrated that he stormed out of Upton Park after being substituted during a win over Sheffield United. Pardew let the rest of the squad decide Tevez\u2019s punishment: they made him train in a Brazil shirt. An \u00a385m takeover had been completed by then \u2013 but not by Joorabchian. Terry Brown had sold up to Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson, an Icelandic billionaire who installed Eggert Magnusson as chairman. On 3 December Mascherano made his final appearance for West Ham, coming on in the 84th minute of a 2-0 defeat at Everton. He was at fault for the second goal, summing up his time at the club. Three days later West Ham were beaten at home by Wigan Athletic, after which Pardew was called into Magnusson\u2019s office and told that the board were fully behind him. Yet Pardew\u2019s charm had worn off and he was sacked within a week, a 4-0 loss at Bolton proving the final straw. \u201cI texted Pardew and said I felt the players had let him down,\u201d Etherington says. \u201cWe lost our way and I felt the players had a lot to do with that, not so much the manager. People believed their own hype. We took our eye off the ball, me included.\u201d Gudmundsson was rarely seen at Upton Park but Magnusson was panicking. He appointed Alan Curbishley, an experienced pragmatist. The former Charlton manager had an unforgettable first game, beating the eventual champions, Manchester United, at Upton Park, but it was a temporary high. West Ham followed the win with three draws and nine defeats. Curbishley, who was reluctant to use Tevez at first, was aghast at his squad\u2019s attitude. There was talk of a gambling culture within the club. \u201cWe were probably enjoying ourselves a bit too much,\u201d one former player admits. Curbishley ripped into his players after a 6-0 defeat at Reading on New Year\u2019s Day, criticising their flash lifestyles and fast cars, which led to them being dubbed the Baby Bentley brigade. \u201cHe was very forthright, which sometimes isn\u2019t the best thing to do,\u201d Etherington adds. \u201cHe called players out. It was a bold move. Was it right? I\u2019d say no but eventually we got our act together.\u201d Curbishley spent in January, signing Luis Boa Morte, Calum Davenport, Lucas Neill, Nigel Quashie and Matthew Upson. Kepa Blanco also joined on loan from Sevilla. Upson had dropped everything to join West Ham from Birmingham on deadline day. The centre-back did not even have his boots with him. His agent had to buy a pair from a shop near Upton Park. No wonder Upson limped off on his debut, a 1-0 defeat by Aston Villa. Injuries meant he only played another 11 minutes before the season was over. Everything was going wrong and West Ham looked relegated after a 4-3 home defeat by Tottenham. They were 10 points off 17th with eight games left. A teenage Mark Noble, finally given a chance in midfield, wept after the final whistle. Yet something changed that afternoon: Tevez scored his first goal, bending in a free-kick from 25 yards. West Ham ended their winless run two weeks later, coming from behind to win at Blackburn. Tevez won and scored a penalty and Zamora scored a winner that would not have made it past VAR. The striker\u2019s shot failed to cross the line because it hit Tevez, who was offside. West Ham built on their moment of fortune and the argument that they were a one-man team, utterly reliant on Tevez, overlooked vital contributions from other players. Ferdinand struck up a good partnership with James Collins in central defence. Yossi Benayoun found his creative spark. Noble excelled. Robert Green had the game of his life when another Zamora goal saw West Ham win at Arsenal in April, making save after save. Neill\u2019s leadership was also invaluable. \u201cLucas had a big say in our revival, more than the manager I\u2019d say,\u201d Etherington says. \u201cCarlos got the headlines but there were other factors that led to us staying up. That\u2019s what people forget.\u201d That is lost on Neil Warnock\u2019s Sheffield United, who moved 10 points clear of West Ham after beating them 3-0 at home on 14 April. Yet United froze and West Ham rallied. A Zamora stunner brought them a 1-0 win over Everton. Boa Morte, Benayoun and Harewood scored in a 3-0 win at Wigan.

At Bramall Lane, meanwhile, Warnock\u2019s team stumbled against Wigan, who stayed up thanks to a penalty from David Unsworth.

      "body": "<p>To start with, a couple of statistics that may go some way to explaining <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/24/eddie-jones-restores-george-ford-for-world-cup-semi-final-against-all-blacks\" title=\"\">why England have recalled George Ford</a> to face New Zealand on Saturday. Against Australia last Saturday, England\u2019s kicking metres were more than 800; New Zealand, in their quarter-final, more than 700. England kicked from hand on 20 occasions, reclaiming the ball nine times; the All Blacks kicked from hand on 29 occasions and won the ball back a staggering 19 times.</p> <p>Both sides thrive on territory because they have such good efficiency when they get into the opponents\u2019 22. They have the ability and the skill set to maximise how often they come away with points whenever the get into that area. Ford provides England with another kicking option and the way he has given his side territory whenever he has played has been fantastic.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/25/england-new-zealand-all-blacks-bleak-record-world-cup-semi-final\">Played three lost three \u2013 England\u2019s bleak record against New Zealand | Ben Hart</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It seems to have been forgotten in all the talk of Ford and Owen Farrell that New Zealand also have two fly\u2011halves, it\u2019s just that the second is Beauden Barrett at full-back. He has said that in his first few matches at full-back with Richie Mo\u2019unga at No 10, he found himself still occupying positions that a fly-half would, that he was almost stepping on Mo\u2019unga\u2019s toes. He has had to learn how to operate in his own space and it is a testament to his quality that he is doing that so well.</p> <p>I believe that Barrett is the best fly-half in the world but he has now established himself as the best full\u2011back in the world. There is not a better player anywhere. We can get obsessed with whether Farrell is a No 10 or a No 12 but the best players in the world, and Farrell is one of those, don\u2019t care \u2013 they still have a huge impact on the game.</p> <p>As much as the teams will kick for territory, it is kicking to win the ball back as well. Both teams have world class back-threes and their ability to control broken field play sets them apart. By that I mean both sides are so well versed at manufacturing broken field play. As soon as you win the ball back you are on the front foot and it creates counterattack ball. Saracens do it better than anyone and they have had a fair bit of success over the last few years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a match like this there are two areas that will be decisive. First, it\u2019s the battle on the floor. Can you control the speed of the ruck, come out on top in terms of turnovers and own the gainline?</p> <p>Then there is the battle of the airwaves. If England are going to control that then they will need Ben Youngs to be on the money with his box-kicking because Aaron Smith is the leading scrum-half in the world, but if they can then it will give them such a stronghold from which to build momentum.</p> <p>Whenever a coach picks a team they are looking to find the balance between a style of play that enables the team to achieve its objectives and at the same time provide an antidote to what the opposition is trying to do. Last week the threat was obvious \u2013 England were wary of Samu Kerevi and so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/17/england-rugby-world-cup-eddie-jones-owen-farrell\" title=\"\">Eddie Jones wanted to bolster that 10-12 channel</a>.

      "bodyText": "To start with, a couple of statistics that may go some way to explaining why England have recalled George Ford to face New Zealand on Saturday. Against Australia last Saturday, England\u2019s kicking metres were more than 800; New Zealand, in their quarter-final, more than 700. England kicked from hand on 20 occasions, reclaiming the ball nine times; the All Blacks kicked from hand on 29 occasions and won the ball back a staggering 19 times. Both sides thrive on territory because they have such good efficiency when they get into the opponents\u2019 22. They have the ability and the skill set to maximise how often they come away with points whenever the get into that area. Ford provides England with another kicking option and the way he has given his side territory whenever he has played has been fantastic. It seems to have been forgotten in all the talk of Ford and Owen Farrell that New Zealand also have two fly\u2011halves, it\u2019s just that the second is Beauden Barrett at full-back. He has said that in his first few matches at full-back with Richie Mo\u2019unga at No 10, he found himself still occupying positions that a fly-half would, that he was almost stepping on Mo\u2019unga\u2019s toes. He has had to learn how to operate in his own space and it is a testament to his quality that he is doing that so well. I believe that Barrett is the best fly-half in the world but he has now established himself as the best full\u2011back in the world. There is not a better player anywhere. We can get obsessed with whether Farrell is a No 10 or a No 12 but the best players in the world, and Farrell is one of those, don\u2019t care \u2013 they still have a huge impact on the game. As much as the teams will kick for territory, it is kicking to win the ball back as well. Both teams have world class back-threes and their ability to control broken field play sets them apart. By that I mean both sides are so well versed at manufacturing broken field play. As soon as you win the ball back you are on the front foot and it creates counterattack ball. Saracens do it better than anyone and they have had a fair bit of success over the last few years. In a match like this there are two areas that will be decisive. First, it\u2019s the battle on the floor. Can you control the speed of the ruck, come out on top in terms of turnovers and own the gainline? Then there is the battle of the airwaves. If England are going to control that then they will need Ben Youngs to be on the money with his box-kicking because Aaron Smith is the leading scrum-half in the world, but if they can then it will give them such a stronghold from which to build momentum. Whenever a coach picks a team they are looking to find the balance between a style of play that enables the team to achieve its objectives and at the same time provide an antidote to what the opposition is trying to do. Last week the threat was obvious \u2013 England were wary of Samu Kerevi and so Eddie Jones wanted to bolster that 10-12 channel. The best way I can sum up his selection policy this week is that everything has been flipped on its head. The first half will be a wrestle for control. It is likely that when things open up in the last 20 minutes we will see Sonny Bill Williams coming on for New Zealand and providing a similar sort of threat to Kerevi. In that instance it would be no surprise to see Manu Tuilagi move back to inside\u2011centre, Farrell moving to fly-half and Henry Slade coming on at No 13. It\u2019s the same with the lineout. It is an area where England struggled badly in the second half against New Zealand a year ago so who better than to come on in the second half than George Kruis, England\u2019s best lineout operator, to shore things up?

Only a 25-minute train ride from where I live in Brighton, Worthing\u2019s where we come when Brighton gets a bit too busy. It\u2019s a traditional Georgian seaside resort, with an art deco pier (which won Pier of the Year 2019), old-fashioned amusements and ice-cream parlours, a new big wheel and a lovely, long pebbly beach. When the sun shines ... It\u2019s easy for us to get to Worthing from Brighton, but Londoners can get there easily too \u2013 the direct train from London Victoria only takes 90 minutes. This year, the Worthing Observation Wheel opened. At 46 metres high, it\u2019s the tallest observation wheel on the south coast, and is open from April to October.

      "bodyText": "Dancers do it, Instagrammers do it, even the Venus de Milo does it. When it comes to striking a pose, it seems the only way is contrapposto. Now research has shed light on why the attitude is so appealing. Experts say the pose, which involves standing with weight predominantly on one foot with a slight twist in the upper body, makes the waist-to-hip ratio appear strikingly low on one side of the body. A low waist-to-hip ratio \u2013 reflecting an hourglass shape \u2013 has previously been linked to attractiveness and impressions of fertility and health in women. \u201cWe think that artists have intuitively figured out that this posture is more attractive, and applied it in their artistic endeavours,\u201d said Dr Farid Pazhoohi, now based at the University of British Columbia, Canada. While research has suggested a waist-to-hip ratio of 0.7 is deemed most attractive in real women, studies have suggested the most popular imaginary women have even lower ratios \u2013 in particular a very small waist \u2013 a finding that might help to explain the appeal of characters such as Betty Boop and Jessica Rabbit. Now researchers have shown that both a woman\u2019s pose and the angle from which they are seen can alter their apparent waist-to-hip ratio \u2013 potentially explaining why the contrapposto stance is so popular. Although contrapposto is also often used by men \u2013 not least Michelangelo\u2019s David \u2013 the study did not explore the impact on how their ratio appeared, or how others might respond to it. Writing in the journal Archives of Sexual Behavior, Pazhooi and colleagues report how they created 3D avatars of a woman standing up straight and contrapposto, with the body cropped from the shoulders to the knee. Each pose was shown from eight different angles. Looking across the body, the waist-to-hip ratio was similar for both poses at all angles. But when left and right sides of the body were considered separately there was a difference. For the standing-straight pose, the left and right waist-to-hip ratios were similar for all angles, except side-on, but for the contrapposto pose the ratio was always far lower on one side of the body than the other. The team showed the images to a total of 68 heterosexual university students, 25 men and 43 women, and asked them to rate how attractive they found them. In addition the team tracked participants\u2019 eye movements as they looked at the images. The results show that men rated the images as more attractive than women, but both sexes rated the contrapposto pose overall as more attractive than standing up straight. Further analysis showed the results to be driven by particular angles of the contrapposto pose proving more attractive than the comparable standing pose \u2013 including the front-on view, back-view and the woman facing diagonally away from the the viewer. The eye-tracking data showed for almost all angles of the standing-up-straight pose, both men and women spent about the same length of time looking at the left and right side of the avatar. However for almost all of the contrapposto angles they spent longer looking at one side \u2013 the side with the lower waist-to-hip ratio \u2013 while their eyes flew to this side first, and more often. In other words, edges that looked curvier grabbed their attention. The study has limitations, including that it did not consider differences in how the figure\u2019s breasts appeared in the different images. However the team suggest the low waist-to-hip ratio produced on one side when standing in a contrapposto pose, and its contrast with the high ratio on the other side, makes a woman stand out from the crowd and appear more attractive. They even suggest the findings may explain why certain movements, gaits and even dance moves in women are deemed more attractive. \u201cFor example, when models do catwalk or dancers do belly dancing, they try to appear frequently in exaggerated contrapposto body forms, including lower than 0.7, and people consider these movements very attractive,\u201d said Pazhoohi. \u201cSimilarly, when women walk on high heels, it helps accentuate the contrapposto form.\u201d",

It finds Gadsby having more fun than she did in its predecessor, without stinting on Nanette\u2019s key qualities of angry anti-sexism and fierce assertiveness of her right to be herself. Even ardent Nanette-bashers would have to acknowledge Gadsby\u2019s skill in combining laugh-heavy standup with trenchant argument, as her goofy story about oversharing on a dog walk shines a light on men\u2019s zeal for claiming and naming things. The pill? \u201cBalls\u201d for testicles? The so-called Pouch of Douglas, a cavity between the rectum and the uterus? Gadsby is indignant \u2013 and funny \u2013 about all of them.</p> <p>The subject of her autism is introduced via an anecdote about school-age Gadsby missing the point \u2013 by a wide margin \u2013 in a lesson on prepositions. Finally, the show proposes her autism as an answer to what Gadsby\u2019s comedy is \u2013 neither lecture nor monologue, but an autistic woman\u2019s way of sharing her idiosyncratic perspective. This is demonstrated via an irreverent art history tour, singling out (usually chauvinist) details in Renaissance painting. Elsewhere, there\u2019s less idiosyncratic material, in a middle section where Gadsby proves \u201cI don\u2019t need hormones to be unreasonable\u201d by grouching about Where\u2019s Wally? and men who golf. An attack on anti-vaxxers, however justifiable, is distinguished more by heat than light.</p> <p>But Douglas remains a rich and entertaining show from Gadsby, one that achieves the impressive feat of both living up to Nanette and moving on from it.</p> <ul> <li><p>At the <a href=\"https://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whats-on/135673-hannah-gadsby-douglas-2019\">Royal Festival Hall, London</a>, 25 and 27 October. <a href=\"http://hannahgadsby.com.au/#shows\">Then touring</a>.</p></li> </ul>",

It finds Gadsby having more fun than she did in its predecessor, without stinting on Nanette\u2019s key qualities of angry anti-sexism and fierce assertiveness of her right to be herself. Even ardent Nanette-bashers would have to acknowledge Gadsby\u2019s skill in combining laugh-heavy standup with trenchant argument, as her goofy story about oversharing on a dog walk shines a light on men\u2019s zeal for claiming and naming things. The pill? \u201cBalls\u201d for testicles? The so-called Pouch of Douglas, a cavity between the rectum and the uterus? Gadsby is indignant \u2013 and funny \u2013 about all of them. The subject of her autism is introduced via an anecdote about school-age Gadsby missing the point \u2013 by a wide margin \u2013 in a lesson on prepositions. Finally, the show proposes her autism as an answer to what Gadsby\u2019s comedy is \u2013 neither lecture nor monologue, but an autistic woman\u2019s way of sharing her idiosyncratic perspective. This is demonstrated via an irreverent art history tour, singling out (usually chauvinist) details in Renaissance painting. Elsewhere, there\u2019s less idiosyncratic material, in a middle section where Gadsby proves \u201cI don\u2019t need hormones to be unreasonable\u201d by grouching about Where\u2019s Wally? and men who golf. An attack on anti-vaxxers, however justifiable, is distinguished more by heat than light. But Douglas remains a rich and entertaining show from Gadsby, one that achieves the impressive feat of both living up to Nanette and moving on from it. At the Royal Festival Hall, London, 25 and 27 October. Then touring.",

Staley praised the performance of the investment banking division, which made pre-tax profits of \u00a3882m in the third quarter, up 77% on the same period in 2018. Barclays has been under pressure from the activist investor Edward Bramson to scale back its investment banking division, which critics say has sucked up too much cash while offering little financial return for shareholders.

Barclays\u2019 shares rose to their highest level since November 2018, up more than 2% to 171p, in morning trading. Nicholas Hyett, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cIt\u2019s just one quarter but this is exactly the picture CEO Jes Staley wants to paint \u2013 even if the final round of PPI compensation is muddying the water. \u201cA resilient UK bank is cutting costs and keeping bad loans to a minimum, generating a reliable income stream. Meanwhile, the corporate and investment bank is putting the icing on the cake with lower capital-intensity fee income and increasing corporate loans. The combination is generating a healthy return on shareholders\u2019 capital. \u201cUnfortunately, Barclays could be approaching a \u2018steady state\u2019 just as conditions turn. The bank\u2019s stuck to its existing targets on profitability this time out but warned they\u2019re becoming increasingly ambitious given the economic backdrop.\u201d On Thursday Barclays bowed to public pressure and scrapped a decision to stop its customers from withdrawing cash at post offices after a barrage of criticism. The bank\u2019s U-turn came after it emerged that Barclays bosses would be questioned about the decision by a committee of MPs who had labelled it \u201ca petty, penny-pinching move\u201d and were hours away from publishing a highly critical report on the controversy. Barclays said it had been \u201cpersuaded to rethink\u201d its decision and would keep the cash withdrawal facility after all. \u201cObviously, we believed that we were making the correct decision when we made it,\u201d Staley said, but he added that talks with the UK government, MPs and consumer support groups had changed its mind.",

Big kudos goes out to Pete Buttigieg, Juli\u00e1n Castro, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren for agreeing to this format. Candidates spent roughly the same amount of time listening as talking, and all their answers had to respond to personal experiences from everyday people from all walks of life.

On the morning after winning the \u00a310,000 prize, the author is suffering from a headache \u2013 brought on by adrenaline rather than alcohol \u2013 and is full of praise for her fellow shortlisted writers (there are Forward prizes for first collection and best poem, as well for best collection). These include Jay Bernard, Ilya Kaminsky, Raymond Antrobus and Holly Pester, \u201cwho read an amazing poem at the award ceremony, about an abortion \u2013 it was ragged and raw and beautiful\u201d, she says. \u201cPoetry is so rich and healthy and diverse at the moment.\u201d</p> \n<p>In person Benson is quietly spoken, often ending an answer to a question with an apology \u2013 \u201csorry for the feminist rant\u201d \u2013 or by checking to make sure she\u2019s been clear. She describes herself as a \u201cprivate person\u201d living in Devon with her husband and two daughters, but her poems, written \u201cas if nobody is listening\u201d, are exposing. They peel away at the layers of the female body and examine, tenderly yet unflinchingly, its murky chambers. There\u2019s a poem about the \u201cridged outer labyrinth\u201d, the \u201cintimate, violet latch\u201d of the narrator\u2019s placenta; another called \u201cRuins\u201d, which describes the worn landscape of a post-partum body, its \u201cinflamed trenches / and lost dominions\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"16f496f1-ee66-4623-b6a5-61e4d28b6e26\" data-atom-type=\"explainer\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Explainer\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>If it feels as if she is staking out new territory here, Benson herself denies originality, citing immediate forebears including Sharon Olds and Kate Clanchy, but also an older, near-forgotten history of popular ballads and folksong. \u201cPeople keep talking about me and [fellow poet] <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/11/saturday-poem-bostin-fittle-liz-berry\" title=\"\">Liz Berry</a> as if we are doing something new and we\u2019re not,\u201d she says. \u201cPopular ballads are full of things like incredibly physical, visceral accounts of pregnancy, child killing, sex and giving birth \u2013 there\u2019s even one where there\u2019s a caesarean. We need to retrieve all that. If we erase precedent and history we are constantly beginning again \u2013 and that\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p> \n<p>Benson, born in 1978, began writing as a child \u2013 \u201clittle flashes of things. After I read <em>Cry, the Beloved Country </em>by Alan Paton I wrote a very sincere anti-apartheid poem, and my grandpa had Alzheimer\u2019s and I remember writing about that very young \u2013 it was a way of processing things I was finding traumatic. I didn\u2019t start keeping a notebook till I was 17.\u201d She has a doctorate in early modern literature, and poetry is her medium because, she says simply, \u201cIt\u2019s just what comes.\u201d Her first collection, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/23/bright-travellers-fiona-benson-review-poetry-collection\" title=\"\">Bright Travellers</a></em> (2014), won the Seamus Heaney award.</p> \n<p><em>Vertigo &amp; Ghost</em> begins with a poem recalling a naive, adolescent longing for love and sex, but then plunges into a sequence of dazzling poems that use Greek myth as their handholds, in which Zeus, king of the gods, figures as a sexual predator. This is a deranged, raging god, the rapist of your darkest nightmares, who communicates in italicised capitals, who looks down amusedly at certain favoured mortals: \u201c<em>I LOVE THIS PRESIDENT. / HIS SHINY GOLD TOWER.</em>\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/21/fiona-benson-vertigo-ghost-kate-kellaway-review\">Vertigo &amp; Ghost by Fiona Benson review \u2013 songs of shock and survival</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>A number of these poems were written in a single burst, one half-term when she was visiting her parents with her children, and had an evening to herself. When she brought them to her editor at Cape, the poet Robin Robertson, \u201cI was practically crying, because I didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d make of them.\u201d He encouraged her, and sent her back to Ovid\u2019s <em>Metamorphoses</em> to do more. Benson\u2019s reforging of episodes from that work of transformations is spectacular, turning the Roman poet\u2019s sometimes voyeuristic rapes (very much seen from \u201coutside\u201d, and often troublingly aestheticised) inwards into the female body.</p> \n<p>She worries, though, that the framework of myth protects the reader too much. \u201cIt makes it safe in a way,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve been on Radio 4 and they want me to talk about myth but they do not want to hear, or feel they cannot broadcast, some of the transformations because they are so bodily. It\u2019s still taboo to talk about rape and women\u2019s bodies that way. So part of me feels like I have given people a safe way to think about it \u2013 and I\u2019m not sure I want them to feel like that.\u201d I wonder if the obverse is true, that by plugging into the matrix of myth the reader is given a means to confront what would otherwise be impossibly raw.</p> \n<p>The second part of the collection deals with the narrator\u2019s rural life, her experience of childbirth and motherhood, so that the whole collection forms a kind of cycle of a woman\u2019s life. The common thread through all this is anxiety, a feeling of fragility, of porousness. There\u2019s a sense that things are OK, but they could crumble; and in too many places across the world, they already have. For example, in \u201cHide and Seek\u201d a game with her children brings thoughts of \u201cfamilies squeezed behind false walls / or hidden under the floor\u201d while hostile soldiers search.</p> \n<p>In another poem, \u201cEurofighter Typhoon\u201d, a plane roars low over the garden, \u201cwith a metallic, grinding scream / like the sky\u2019s being chainsawed open\u201d, and the narrator comforts her frightened girls while she thinks of other mothers, in other places, digging their children \u201cout of the rubble in parts like plaster dolls\u201d. Benson mentions Sarah Kane\u2019s play <em>Blasted </em>\u2013 in which the violence of the war in the Balkans explodes into a room in Britain, and fractures everything, including dramatic form itself. Even \u201cLove Poem, Lucca\u201d, which ends on a note of affection and tentative comfort, is afflicted by the vertigo of the collection\u2019s title; the narrator wants to climb a lovely Italian medieval tower, but when she does so, she is a wreck, and all she can see is \u201cthe four walls sledging off through space\u201d. I can\u2019t think of anything else I\u2019ve read that so accurately describes the seam of dread that lurks just beneath the surface of our times.</p> \n<p>Benson, above all, thinks of herself as a reader \u2013 a reader who has joined the great flow of literature that courses on and on. \u201cIt\u2019s a great privilege to join in this conversation. I\u2019ve studied early modern literature and I know how much gets lost. Most of it won\u2019t be remembered, but those few poems that are remembered will reflect what\u2019s been going on around them. It\u2019s a privilege to be part of that river of voices.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 <em>Vertigo &amp; Ghost</em> is published by Jonathan Cape.

These include Jay Bernard, Ilya Kaminsky, Raymond Antrobus and Holly Pester, \u201cwho read an amazing poem at the award ceremony, about an abortion \u2013 it was ragged and raw and beautiful\u201d, she says. \u201cPoetry is so rich and healthy and diverse at the moment.\u201d In person Benson is quietly spoken, often ending an answer to a question with an apology \u2013 \u201csorry for the feminist rant\u201d \u2013 or by checking to make sure she\u2019s been clear. She describes herself as a \u201cprivate person\u201d living in Devon with her husband and two daughters, but her poems, written \u201cas if nobody is listening\u201d, are exposing. They peel away at the layers of the female body and examine, tenderly yet unflinchingly, its murky chambers. There\u2019s a poem about the \u201cridged outer labyrinth\u201d, the \u201cintimate, violet latch\u201d of the narrator\u2019s placenta; another called \u201cRuins\u201d, which describes the worn landscape of a post-partum body, its \u201cinflamed trenches / and lost dominions\u201d. If it feels as if she is staking out new territory here, Benson herself denies originality, citing immediate forebears including Sharon Olds and Kate Clanchy, but also an older, near-forgotten history of popular ballads and folksong. \u201cPeople keep talking about me and [fellow poet] Liz Berry as if we are doing something new and we\u2019re not,\u201d she says. \u201cPopular ballads are full of things like incredibly physical, visceral accounts of pregnancy, child killing, sex and giving birth \u2013 there\u2019s even one where there\u2019s a caesarean. We need to retrieve all that. If we erase precedent and history we are constantly beginning again \u2013 and that\u2019s wrong.\u201d Benson, born in 1978, began writing as a child \u2013 \u201clittle flashes of things. After I read Cry, the Beloved Country by Alan Paton I wrote a very sincere anti-apartheid poem, and my grandpa had Alzheimer\u2019s and I remember writing about that very young \u2013 it was a way of processing things I was finding traumatic. I didn\u2019t start keeping a notebook till I was 17.\u201d She has a doctorate in early modern literature, and poetry is her medium because, she says simply, \u201cIt\u2019s just what comes.\u201d Her first collection, Bright Travellers (2014), won the Seamus Heaney award. Vertigo &amp; Ghost begins with a poem recalling a naive, adolescent longing for love and sex, but then plunges into a sequence of dazzling poems that use Greek myth as their handholds, in which Zeus, king of the gods, figures as a sexual predator. This is a deranged, raging god, the rapist of your darkest nightmares, who communicates in italicised capitals, who looks down amusedly at certain favoured mortals: \u201cI LOVE THIS PRESIDENT. / HIS SHINY GOLD TOWER.\u201d A number of these poems were written in a single burst, one half-term when she was visiting her parents with her children, and had an evening to herself. When she brought them to her editor at Cape, the poet Robin Robertson, \u201cI was practically crying, because I didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d make of them.\u201d He encouraged her, and sent her back to Ovid\u2019s Metamorphoses to do more. Benson\u2019s reforging of episodes from that work of transformations is spectacular, turning the Roman poet\u2019s sometimes voyeuristic rapes (very much seen from \u201coutside\u201d, and often troublingly aestheticised) inwards into the female body. She worries, though, that the framework of myth protects the reader too much. \u201cIt makes it safe in a way,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve been on Radio 4 and they want me to talk about myth but they do not want to hear, or feel they cannot broadcast, some of the transformations because they are so bodily. It\u2019s still taboo to talk about rape and women\u2019s bodies that way. So part of me feels like I have given people a safe way to think about it \u2013 and I\u2019m not sure I want them to feel like that.\u201d I wonder if the obverse is true, that by plugging into the matrix of myth the reader is given a means to confront what would otherwise be impossibly raw. The second part of the collection deals with the narrator\u2019s rural life, her experience of childbirth and motherhood, so that the whole collection forms a kind of cycle of a woman\u2019s life. The common thread through all this is anxiety, a feeling of fragility, of porousness. There\u2019s a sense that things are OK, but they could crumble; and in too many places across the world, they already have. For example, in \u201cHide and Seek\u201d a game with her children brings thoughts of \u201cfamilies squeezed behind false walls / or hidden under the floor\u201d while hostile soldiers search. In another poem, \u201cEurofighter Typhoon\u201d, a plane roars low over the garden, \u201cwith a metallic, grinding scream / like the sky\u2019s being chainsawed open\u201d, and the narrator comforts her frightened girls while she thinks of other mothers, in other places, digging their children \u201cout of the rubble in parts like plaster dolls\u201d. Benson mentions Sarah Kane\u2019s play Blasted \u2013 in which the violence of the war in the Balkans explodes into a room in Britain, and fractures everything, including dramatic form itself. Even \u201cLove Poem, Lucca\u201d, which ends on a note of affection and tentative comfort, is afflicted by the vertigo of the collection\u2019s title; the narrator wants to climb a lovely Italian medieval tower, but when she does so, she is a wreck, and all she can see is \u201cthe four walls sledging off through space\u201d. I can\u2019t think of anything else I\u2019ve read that so accurately describes the seam of dread that lurks just beneath the surface of our times. Benson, above all, thinks of herself as a reader \u2013 a reader who has joined the great flow of literature that courses on and on. \u201cIt\u2019s a great privilege to join in this conversation. I\u2019ve studied early modern literature and I know how much gets lost. Most of it won\u2019t be remembered, but those few poems that are remembered will reflect what\u2019s been going on around them. It\u2019s a privilege to be part of that river of voices.\u201d \u2022 Vertigo &amp; Ghost is published by Jonathan Cape.

They found her pro bono attorneys and requested the girl\u2019s case be overseen by an independent child advocate, a service available to some unaccompanied<strong> </strong>immigrant children in government custody. The child advocate got federal officials to allow Alexa and her niece to call twice a week.</p> <p>For many other families like Alexa\u2019s, phone calls with children don\u2019t happen at all, says Weiss, the attorney. \u201cIf that person is not the biological parent or legal guardian, there is no guarantee of communication.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>An immigration judge has found Alexa\u2019s case credible and acknowledged she suffered harm, but denied her case met the complex legal standard for asylum. Her attorney Suzannah Maclay has filed an intent to appeal but says the case could take over two years to reach a resolution, given the current backlog in cases and the Trump administration\u2019s constant changes to the immigration system. There is a chance, however, Alexa could be released from detention sooner through other legal motions.</p> <p>Like other separated caregivers, she\u2019s now facing dueling priorities: enduring detention long enough to defend herself from deportation back to danger, and reuniting with her child as quickly as possible \u2013 even when there is no clear path to do so.</p> <p>In detention, most days resemble one another. She sleeps as much as she can. Her uniform makes her feel like a criminal. The food is always the same \u2013 \u201cpotatoes, potatoes and more potatoes\u201d.

Her heart aches for her child, and it\u2019s hard to accept that the girl she raised as a daughter now lives with strangers. \u201cWithout her I feel like everything is over,\u201d she says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019ve been locked up for a long time without having done anything, my only mistake was to ask for asylum</p> <footer> <cite>Alexa</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI am desperate and depressed,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve been locked up for a long time without having done anything, my only mistake was to ask for asylum.\u201d</p> <p>But if she were to return to Guatemala, she knows she wouldn\u2019t be safe. \u201cThey are looking for me to kill me,\u201d she says.

Alexa would probably have to board a plane alone, trusting the government and advocates to ensure her child would one day join her.</p> <p>In the meantime, Alexa looks forward to those days when she talks to her girl. Sometimes they make small talk about the dolls the girl plays with, or the school she attends. Other times, she tells Alexa she has a magic wand that will make the distance between them disappear.

They found her pro bono attorneys and requested the girl\u2019s case be overseen by an independent child advocate, a service available to some unaccompanied immigrant children in government custody. The child advocate got federal officials to allow Alexa and her niece to call twice a week. For many other families like Alexa\u2019s, phone calls with children don\u2019t happen at all, says Weiss, the attorney. \u201cIf that person is not the biological parent or legal guardian, there is no guarantee of communication.\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 An immigration judge has found Alexa\u2019s case credible and acknowledged she suffered harm, but denied her case met the complex legal standard for asylum. Her attorney Suzannah Maclay has filed an intent to appeal but says the case could take over two years to reach a resolution, given the current backlog in cases and the Trump administration\u2019s constant changes to the immigration system. There is a chance, however, Alexa could be released from detention sooner through other legal motions. Like other separated caregivers, she\u2019s now facing dueling priorities: enduring detention long enough to defend herself from deportation back to danger, and reuniting with her child as quickly as possible \u2013 even when there is no clear path to do so. In detention, most days resemble one another. She sleeps as much as she can. Her uniform makes her feel like a criminal. The food is always the same \u2013 \u201cpotatoes, potatoes and more potatoes\u201d. She is often sick to her stomach, and sometimes it is hard to distinguish whether it is the food or the anxiety of not knowing what will happen next. Sometimes she is hopeful. She has heard from the child advocate maybe the girl can be transferred to Arizona and they can have brief reunions in the detention visitor room. She is learning to read in English and Spanish, so she can understand her legal documents rather than just stare at them. Increasingly, though, she thinks it\u2019s better to be deported than keep fighting in detention. Her heart aches for her child, and it\u2019s hard to accept that the girl she raised as a daughter now lives with strangers. \u201cWithout her I feel like everything is over,\u201d she says. \u201cI am desperate and depressed,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve been locked up for a long time without having done anything, my only mistake was to ask for asylum.\u201d But if she were to return to Guatemala, she knows she wouldn\u2019t be safe. \u201cThey are looking for me to kill me,\u201d she says. And she fears an American family will adopt the little girl if she were to return, though legal advocates say that rarely happens. It\u2019s more likely if Alexa were to be deported, the child\u2019s advocate would arrange for the girl to also return to Guatemala \u2013 even though it could take months for her to follow. Alexa would probably have to board a plane alone, trusting the government and advocates to ensure her child would one day join her. In the meantime, Alexa looks forward to those days when she talks to her girl. Sometimes they make small talk about the dolls the girl plays with, or the school she attends. Other times, she tells Alexa she has a magic wand that will make the distance between them disappear. There\u2019s not a call when the girl doesn\u2019t ask how much longer they will have to wait to be together. Alexa has to say it\u2019s all in the hands of a judge. It\u2019s tough to explain to a six-year-old she protected all her life that she\u2019s now powerless. She\u2019s all the family Alexa has. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not willing to lose her,\u201d she says.",

      "bodyText": "One of the best weekends of the year has to be the one that is an hour longer than all the others. Yes, it\u2019s time to put the clocks back on Sunday \u2013 at least in Europe. We had a little look at all the knock-on effects of changing the clocks and found some subtle benefits, as well as a drawback or two. In short: great for a lie-in and possibly good as an energy-saving measure. But not fun if you\u2019re a shift worker, and have to do that extra hour unpaid. Saving energy is a very 2019 idea, from flight abstainers to #FridaysForFuture school strikers. This week, Nicola Cutcher reported for the Upside on the innovators determined to cut back on the huge volumes of dirty fuel consumed by the multibillion-dollar shipping industry ever year. Otherwise, in no particular order, we also found time for: 2,000 of the world\u2019s most impressive youngsters \u2013 all in one place. Two-minute read South Africa\u2019s most inclusive public space. Four-minute read An enterprising way to get kids away from knives and gangs. Two-minute read The dogs of archaeology. Short and sweet Good news for seals. 90-second read Lucky numbers Donald Trump may have confirmed the US will definitely leave the Paris climate agreement. But as this rather pretty chart from Beautiful News demonstrates, he is very much in a minority. Meanwhile, Statista, a data research outfit, has come up with some numbers that show for all its current convulsions, people power is steadily taking over the world: more than half of all governments are now democracies. What we liked The UN has launched plans to mark its 75th birthday next year, asking people to come up with three things that can save the world. Natalie Samarasinghe, a driving force behind the initiative, says: \u201cWe are asking people to film themselves and upload to social media (Insta, Twitter, FB) tagging @JoinUN75 and using #UN75.\u201d Alternatively, write to us at theupside@theguardian.com, with a subject line \u2018Three Ideas\u2019. Kudos to Positive News for a long read on co-housing: sort of like an estate where everyone has to talk to each other. And this was illuminating: the rise and rise of biochar. What we heard Lots of you wrote in about cargo sailing ships. Robert Melotti said: I really like the piece on sail cargo: we did something similar a while ago. I think an interesting commercial venture in the making is taking place in Australia right now. Government funding is just around the corner apparently, and plans for much larger sailing container vessels as well. Zdravko Podolski got in touch from Croatia: I really enjoyed your article on sail-driven transport. Can I draw your attention to the fact there is a shipyard in Europe, in Croatia in fact, that is capable of building clipper-sized sailing ships. One was just recently launched. It may warrant an article. And John Lucas sent an idea from Toronto Sailing vessels may well have a useful role but won\u2019t scale to anything like the volume needed. Just look at a photo of London docks in the age of sail \u2013 then multiply by a few hundred! Has any organisation considered building undersea gliders for cargo? Steve Kirby is frustrated: I\u2019ve just enjoyed your Winds Of Change article about sailing ships once again being used to deliver goods across the oceans. I would be interested if you would be able to investigate why many thousands of new homes are being built without solar thermal or PV panels on their roofs. Constant frustration to see new estates being constructed without a solar panel in sight. Surely it would be very easy and cost-effective to install solar as part of a new-build project of multiples of homes. Installing electric boilers would also make sense, especially as the use of gas is to be phased out in the coming years. Where was the Upside? In Northern Ireland, which became a little more tolerant this week. And in the new Asterix comic book, which for the first time centres on a female hero. Thanks for reading.

GPS data from the refrigerated trailer shows it also made two trips between the UK and mainland Europe between 16 October and 22 October, the day the bodies were found in an industrial estate in Essex. The details of the movements of the trailer in the days before it made its final journey emerged as postmortems begin to establish how the 31 men and eight women died. Eleven of the victims, whom police believe to be Chinese nationals, were taken by private ambulance to Broomsfield hospital in Chelmsford. The Chinese ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, said he had sent a team to Essex to help police verify the identities of the victims. He added that their nationality was yet to be confirmed. Detectives have been granted extra time to hold the lorry driver, Mo Robinson, on suspicion of murder. Three properties in Northern Ireland have been raided since the discovery of the bodies on Wednesday and the National Crime Agency is working to establish if organised crime groups were involved. The trailer was leased from one Irish company, the Monaghan-based Global Trailer Rental Europe, on 15 October to another business on the Irish border. It was the first time the second business had made such a leasing arrangement. Sources have said that GPS data from the refrigerated unit shows that it left Monaghan on 15 October, before crossing into Northern Ireland, and then back south into the republic of Ireland. It then travelled from Dublin port to Holyhead in north Wales overnight on 16 October, before crossing over to mainland Europe that evening. It shows the trailer travelled to Dunkirk and Lille in France and Bruges. Dunkirk is 40 minute from Calais and is a known site for people-smugglers preying on migrants seeking to get across the English channel to the UK. The data from the tracking device, which has been passed on to Essex police investigating the murders, also shows the trailer made two journeys between the UK and mainland Europe between October 17 and 22. The data tracks the longitude and latitude of the trailer at all times and has been confirmed by sources. In a statement released on Wednesday, GTR Europe confirmed it was the owner of the refrigerated trailer but it said it was entirely unaware of what the lessee used it for. \u201cThe company has been in contact with police in Essex from early 23 October, immediately upon becoming aware that a trailer on lease from this company had been involved in this incident. Full details of the lessee have been given to the police,\u201d a spokesman said. The parents of the driver have been brought by police to England from their home in Northern Ireland to see him, the Guardian understands. Mo Robinson, 25, a self-employed haulier from County Armagh, was detained after the bodies were discovered in the vehicle on an industrial estate in Grays, Essex on Wednesday. On Thursday, magistrates in Basildon granted officers a warrant to hold him in custody for an additional 24 hours. Their local councillor, Paul Berry, told Sky News: \u201cHis family are very well respected in the area and are very actively involved in community organisations. \u201cOur heart goes out to them because as of yesterday morning they were not aware that he had been arrested.\u201d He added: \u201cThe community\u2019s thoughts and prayers are with the family of the 39 people who have lost their lives.

      "body": "<p>It was during a trip to Australia about 14 years ago that Smith uncovered her adventurous side. A friend convinced her to go camping in the outback with just a simple rollout shelter, called a swag. Smith surprised herself and had a wonderful night watching the stars come out and seeing wildlife wander around nearby. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t scary, it was just incredible,\u201d she says. \u201cFrom that moment on, I wanted more adventure in my life.\u201d</p> <p>Her night under the stars inspired Smith to seek out other quirky places to spend the night. While some people look forward to snuggling under a feather down duvet covered in a high count cotton sheet, Smith can be found in the forest in a hammock or spending the night at the top of a hill. \u201cIt allows me to reconnect with the natural world,\u201d she says. Her nocturnal escapades help her forget her worries and give her a break from email and social media.</p> <p>Although her adventures don\u2019t always end with a night open to the elements. She often opts to spend the night in a bothy \u2013 a disused building such as a farmhouse or miners\u2019 bunkhouse that is left open for hikers to spend the night. On one occasion, she was trying to get to a remote bothy in the Scottish Highlands during a hailstorm. The shelter was across a river and since there was no bridge, she had to brave the cold water.</p> <p>Once she reached the bothy, there was a surprise in store: a group of mates were already using it for a weekend away. But the men were welcoming and gave her dry clothes to wear. Smith notes the camaraderie that is often shared in bothies: \u201cYou never know who might turn up, because you can\u2019t book them, so it\u2019s a tradition to always bring a small bottle of whisky with you to be shared. Most bothies have a fireplace, so you share a drink and tales of your adventures over an open fire. Nothing warms you up in a bothy quite like a whisky.\u201d</p> <p>So, as tradition dictated, the group shared a drink, and the next morning they even made pancakes for Smith \u2013 perhaps the start of a new tradition?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/born-adventurous/2019/oct/21/quiz-are-you-a-born-adventurer\">Quiz: Are you a born adventurer?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Although Smith often sets off on her own, she also teams up for some expeditions. Next year she is joining forces with adventurer Dwayne Fields for an expedition to Antarctica, where they will walk to the south pole from the emperor penguin colony at Berkner Island. One of their goals is to raise awareness of wildlife conservation and environmental issues, so it will be a carbon-negative expedition. \u201cWe\u2019re planting 50 trees each before we go to offset the carbon of actually getting to Antarctica,\u201d says Smith. \u201cAnd where we can we\u2019ll be using sustainably sourced and environmentally friendly kit.\u201d</p> <p>Smith and Fields are also partnering up to change the face of adventure and have named their trip \u201cWeTwo\u201d. As a woman and a black man, both have encountered discrimination, since they don\u2019t fit the typical profile of an adventurer. Smith is actively trying to make adventuring more accessible. And in her podcast, Wander Woman, a twist on the classic superhero, Smith showcases women adventurers from the past who were pioneering but not recognised.</p> <p>Smith sees the outdoors as the ultimate leveller, since it rains on everyone regardless of gender, race and religion. She encourages people to push themselves out of their comfort zone, which doesn\u2019t have to involve travelling far. It can be as simple as climbing the nearest hill or going for a night walk. \u201cAdventure is a state of mind and the first step is just to do it,\u201d she says. \u201cHonestly, you won\u2019t regret it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6d1ff1176514ef44f484abb4b87a4e26c03b69ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d1ff1176514ef44f484abb4b87a4e26c03b69ae/0_0_620_55/500.png\" alt=\"drinkaware colour transparent\" width=\"500\" height=\"44\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em><strong>Spirit of adventure</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.theshackletonwhisky.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shackleton whisky</a> embodies the spirit of a legend and is made for those who are born adventurous \u2013 like its namesake, explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton.</em></p>",

Nothing warms you up in a bothy quite like a whisky.\u201d So, as tradition dictated, the group shared a drink, and the next morning they even made pancakes for Smith \u2013 perhaps the start of a new tradition? Although Smith often sets off on her own, she also teams up for some expeditions. Next year she is joining forces with adventurer Dwayne Fields for an expedition to Antarctica, where they will walk to the south pole from the emperor penguin colony at Berkner Island. One of their goals is to raise awareness of wildlife conservation and environmental issues, so it will be a carbon-negative expedition. \u201cWe\u2019re planting 50 trees each before we go to offset the carbon of actually getting to Antarctica,\u201d says Smith. \u201cAnd where we can we\u2019ll be using sustainably sourced and environmentally friendly kit.\u201d Smith and Fields are also partnering up to change the face of adventure and have named their trip \u201cWeTwo\u201d. As a woman and a black man, both have encountered discrimination, since they don\u2019t fit the typical profile of an adventurer. Smith is actively trying to make adventuring more accessible. And in her podcast, Wander Woman, a twist on the classic superhero, Smith showcases women adventurers from the past who were pioneering but not recognised. Smith sees the outdoors as the ultimate leveller, since it rains on everyone regardless of gender, race and religion. She encourages people to push themselves out of their comfort zone, which doesn\u2019t have to involve travelling far. It can be as simple as climbing the nearest hill or going for a night walk. \u201cAdventure is a state of mind and the first step is just to do it,\u201d she says. \u201cHonestly, you won\u2019t regret it.\u201d Spirit of adventure Shackleton whisky embodies the spirit of a legend and is made for those who are born adventurous \u2013 like its namesake, explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton.",

For many, it\u2019s a personal experience: something connects them to a human story that pivots on science. What might have seemed a dry subject comes alive, and speaks to their heart and spirit.</p> <p>That ambition is central to Medicine: The Wellcome Galleries at the Science Museum in London which, when it opens on 16 November will become the biggest exhibition space of its kind in the world. The 3,000 sq metres (32,300 sq ft) of galleries will be the most significant development in the museum\u2019s 162-year history, and will entirely transform its first floor.</p> <p>The new section will comprise five main galleries and two immersive experiences, which will be grounded in historic collections and will speak to the medical challenges of today and tomorrow; but, says curator Natasha McEnroe, keeper of medicine at the museum, the most important element isn\u2019t to do with objects or displays, it\u2019s the voices of those \u2013 patients and practitioners \u2013 who have first-hand experience of being on the receiving end or the dispensing end of healthcare.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re all interested in our own health and in the health of our loved ones,\u201d says McEnroe. \u201cIt\u2019s something that unites human beings wherever they are in history or wherever they are on the planet.

We hope they\u2019ll grow up to be innovators and may even go on to solve some of the health challenges of the future. The museum has millions of visitors every year, many of them young people, and we hope they\u2019ll be inspired by learning about the journey medicine has made to this point in history, and the ways it is changing for the future.\u201d</p> <p>GSK\u2019s support of Medicine: The Wellcome Galleries dovetails with its work on other fronts to support youngsters in their science learning, according to Dr Rhiannon Lowe who is a scientific investigator for the company. She\u2019s part of the Stem education team at GSK, and she supports more than 100 employees who work as science ambassadors, visiting schools and science and careers fairs to enthuse young people about studying and working in science.</p> <p>Going into schools and talking to students in a range of settings means she can show the links between the curriculum and real life. \u201cI can use what I\u2019m working on in the lab to help young people see the links between what they\u2019re learning about and treatments,\u201d she says. \u201cFor example, gene and cell therapy are now on the biology A-level curriculum, so there\u2019s a direct connection between what they\u2019re learning about and what we\u2019re doing.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/breakthrough-science/2019/apr/12/asthma-inhalers-what-next-for-the-drug-delivery-tech-that-dates-back-to-1778\">Asthma inhalers: what next for the drug delivery tech that dates back to 1778?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In addition, approximately 200 youngsters \u2013 both GCSE and A-level students \u2013 are offered work-experience placements. \u201cWe have a programme called \u2018molecule to market\u2019 that takes them through the pathway that sees scientific developments becoming drugs and treatments,\u201d says Lowe. \u201cYoung people learn about the whole gamut of drug development, from safety to testing to marketing. They\u2019re seeing the application of science in the real world, and that\u2019s very important.\u201d</p> <p>Being in a scientific workplace expands their horizons and gives them new insights. \u201cUntil this point they\u2019ve seen things like electron microscopes only in textbooks \u2013 but on their work experience they see the real thing in use, and they can even try them out.\u201d Teachers, too, are given the chance to immerse themselves in the GSK world. \u201cWe have links with 35 schools across the country, each of which has between five and seven teachers engaged in our professional development scheme,\u201d says Lowe. \u201cWe also produce materials for the classroom, tracing how treatments for asthma and malaria, for example, have developed.\u201d</p> <p>GSK also supports major Stem competitions such as the GSK UK Young Scientist and Young Engineer of the Year and these, says Lowe, show the potential for innovation even among relatively young children. \u201cIn a competition about combating malaria,\u201d she says, \u201cone of the winners was a 13-year-old who extracted some plant material and made it into a candle that acted as a mosquito repellent. And that really brought home that scientific breakthroughs don\u2019t always happen in the laboratory.\u201d As many more youngsters will learn, with the opening of the new medicine galleries.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The world needs the scientists of tomorrow like it\u2019s never needed them before: but what inspires young people to make science their academic pathway, and eventual career? For many, it\u2019s a personal experience: something connects them to a human story that pivots on science. What might have seemed a dry subject comes alive, and speaks to their heart and spirit. That ambition is central to Medicine: The Wellcome Galleries at the Science Museum in London which, when it opens on 16 November will become the biggest exhibition space of its kind in the world. The 3,000 sq metres (32,300 sq ft) of galleries will be the most significant development in the museum\u2019s 162-year history, and will entirely transform its first floor. The new section will comprise five main galleries and two immersive experiences, which will be grounded in historic collections and will speak to the medical challenges of today and tomorrow; but, says curator Natasha McEnroe, keeper of medicine at the museum, the most important element isn\u2019t to do with objects or displays, it\u2019s the voices of those \u2013 patients and practitioners \u2013 who have first-hand experience of being on the receiving end or the dispensing end of healthcare. \u201cWe\u2019re all interested in our own health and in the health of our loved ones,\u201d says McEnroe. \u201cIt\u2019s something that unites human beings wherever they are in history or wherever they are on the planet. And learning from personal stories gives us a different dimension, a different perspective.\u201d The personal stories, she says, are woven into the galleries in a range of different ways: individual patients and practitioners have helped devise the displays, and their stories are also dotted around the galleries in audio and visual presentations. The new galleries draw on two collections \u2013 the Science Museum Group\u2019s own, and the collection of the pharmaceutical entrepreneur Henry Wellcome (1853-1936) \u2013 which together number more than 150,000 objects, of which over 3,000 will be on permanent display. The Wellcome Trust is one of the main funders behind the new galleries, as is GSK, whose Stem education manager Hannah Huxford says the organisation\u2019s commitment to inspire the next generation of scientists overlapped perfectly with the aims of the new galleries. \u201cOur partnership with the Science Museum goes back 25 years,\u201d she says. \u201cAs organisations, we are both committed to inspiring the next generation of scientists and engineers. We hope they\u2019ll grow up to be innovators and may even go on to solve some of the health challenges of the future. The museum has millions of visitors every year, many of them young people, and we hope they\u2019ll be inspired by learning about the journey medicine has made to this point in history, and the ways it is changing for the future.\u201d GSK\u2019s support of Medicine: The Wellcome Galleries dovetails with its work on other fronts to support youngsters in their science learning, according to Dr Rhiannon Lowe who is a scientific investigator for the company. She\u2019s part of the Stem education team at GSK, and she supports more than 100 employees who work as science ambassadors, visiting schools and science and careers fairs to enthuse young people about studying and working in science. Going into schools and talking to students in a range of settings means she can show the links between the curriculum and real life. \u201cI can use what I\u2019m working on in the lab to help young people see the links between what they\u2019re learning about and treatments,\u201d she says. \u201cFor example, gene and cell therapy are now on the biology A-level curriculum, so there\u2019s a direct connection between what they\u2019re learning about and what we\u2019re doing.\u201d In addition, approximately 200 youngsters \u2013 both GCSE and A-level students \u2013 are offered work-experience placements. \u201cWe have a programme called \u2018molecule to market\u2019 that takes them through the pathway that sees scientific developments becoming drugs and treatments,\u201d says Lowe. \u201cYoung people learn about the whole gamut of drug development, from safety to testing to marketing. They\u2019re seeing the application of science in the real world, and that\u2019s very important.\u201d Being in a scientific workplace expands their horizons and gives them new insights. \u201cUntil this point they\u2019ve seen things like electron microscopes only in textbooks \u2013 but on their work experience they see the real thing in use, and they can even try them out.\u201d Teachers, too, are given the chance to immerse themselves in the GSK world. \u201cWe have links with 35 schools across the country, each of which has between five and seven teachers engaged in our professional development scheme,\u201d says Lowe. \u201cWe also produce materials for the classroom, tracing how treatments for asthma and malaria, for example, have developed.\u201d GSK also supports major Stem competitions such as the GSK UK Young Scientist and Young Engineer of the Year and these, says Lowe, show the potential for innovation even among relatively young children. \u201cIn a competition about combating malaria,\u201d she says, \u201cone of the winners was a 13-year-old who extracted some plant material and made it into a candle that acted as a mosquito repellent. And that really brought home that scientific breakthroughs don\u2019t always happen in the laboratory.\u201d As many more youngsters will learn, with the opening of the new medicine galleries.",

Burnley cannot compete with Manchester or Liverpool as a draw for football tourists, nor does it measure itself that way, and the town centre is relatively quiet \u2013 numerous empty shops on St James\u2019s Street reflecting problems nationwide \u2013 considering a Premier League game is an hour from kicking off nearby. Yet its football club continues to thrive, not merely survive.</p> <p>Burnley\u2019s Barnfield training ground, its pitches once prone to flooding, has been rebuilt and brought into the 21st century at a cost of more than \u00a310m. The club\u2019s last published accounts, for 2017-18, showed a record profit of \u00a345m and no outstanding bank or directors\u2019 loans. A turnover of \u00a3139m was the joint 13th highest in the Premier League and only two clubs had a smaller wage bill than Burnley\u2019s \u00a382m. Wages have since increased but to progress in a league where Manchester United\u2019s turnover and wage bills were \u00a3590m and \u00a3296m respectively that same season, and to do so for four seasons (one season more than Jimmy Adamson\u2019s team enjoyed in the top flight in the 1970s), is testament to the meticulous planning and decision-making of Dyche and the Burnley board.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--showcase\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=Sport&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F838c7f488dbda243b6a7313016db4332cf7a95bd%3Fcrop%3D0_509_5283_3170&amp;left-caption=Mascot%20Bertie%20Bee%20meets%20and%20greets%20fans.&amp;right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F319869e5f7c2644b6ffcda7ec22c6bb4ed6c6913%3Fcrop%3D6_336_5161_3097&amp;right-caption=A%20young%20fan%20sporting%20his%20new%20Burnley%20shirt.%20Photographs%3A%20Richard%20Saker%2FThe%20Guardian&amp;always-place-captions-below=false\" data-alt=\"Bertie Bee meets and greets fans.

A young fan sports his new Burnley shirt.</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe main thing you have to get right as a chairman is to pick the right manager,\u201d says Mike Garlick, the Burnley chairman. \u201cIf you do that you are halfway there at least. Sean has been key. We had Eddie Howe before that but location-wise it just didn\u2019t suit Eddie and his family, so it didn\u2019t quite work out. Another great manager.\u201d</p> <p>Garlick is speaking in the London office of Michael Bailey Associates, the workforce project management and consulting company he founded in 1989 and now heads as its chief executive officer. His roots are unmistakably Burnley, however, and most of his fellow directors are from the area. The club\u2019s success has been homegrown.</p> <p>\u201cI was born in the town, about 400 yards from the club,\u201d the chairman says. \u201cI went to school there, then went to uni and came to London to seek my fortune. When I was 18 I told my dad I wanted to be chairman of Burnley one day. He said: \u2018You must be bloody crackers son.\u2019 It was a lifelong ambition to do this. I think one of the reasons we do so well is that myself and the other directors are all fairly local and we all really care. We are not there to pick up a wage. No director gets paid. You get a night in a hotel paid for but that\u2019s it.</p> <p>\u201cI proudly state that I am the Premier League\u2019s poorest owner. Everyone else is a billionaire, virtually. But I am proud of that and what we have achieved because we have had to sweat every asset both on and off the pitch to get the best from it.</p> <p>\u201cThat means working really cleverly in the transfer market, looking for value \u2013 and if we don\u2019t see that value we don\u2019t buy. Sometimes that drives the fans up the wall but we have to have value in everything we do.</p> <p>\u201cIt could be a young player that we think could do well for us and we could sell on for a profit or an older player we think could add value to the squad now. All we can do is live within our means.

      "bodyText": "A Frenchman, a Spaniard and two Belgians walk into a pub in Burnley. There is no punchline. The four are drinking in the Royal Dyche before Burnley\u2019s win over Everton and their presence gives a little demonstration of the impact close to four years of Premier League football and seven years of Sean Dyche have had on a club that takes neither for granted. Whether others outside Turf Moor recognise the scale of achievement is open to question. \u201cA number of years ago I used to think: \u2018Does anyone recognise the enormity of where this club was to where it is now?\u2019\u201d says Dyche, who will mark seven years as the Burnley manager on Wednesday. \u201cBut I\u2019m really not that precious about it now. The staff, the players, the board and chief exec know what we do and I think the fans do too. They are the important parties. We work authentically and honestly.\u201d Qualities that may appear unfashionable amid the glitz of the Premier League have made Burnley something of a role model. St\u00e9phane Blach, Camilo Guerra, Bernard Brasseur and Laurent Titeux are the overseas visitors for the Everton game. Work colleagues in Luxembourg, the four take in two Premier League matches over one weekend every year and have chosen Burnley for the second season running because, they insist, the atmosphere at Turf Moor is superior to most other stadiums visited. And because they love the Royal Dyche, renamed last year after a joke about celebrating the Burnley manager if he took the club into Europe became a promise. There can be no greater honour for the man whose face adorns the claret-and-sky-blue walls, the Henry VIII-style sign above the door and has even been carved into a tree stump in the beer garden. \u201cI don\u2019t think we would have heard of Burnley if it wasn\u2019t for the club being in the Premier League,\u201d Guerra says. \u201cWe went to London for a few years, then Manchester and from there we discovered Burnley. It is amazing here. The people are super friendly.\u201d The four were staying in Manchester, where they watch City\u2019s defeat by Wolves the day after Jeff Hendrick\u2019s winner against Everton lifted Burnley briefly into fourth place in the richest league on the planet. Burnley cannot compete with Manchester or Liverpool as a draw for football tourists, nor does it measure itself that way, and the town centre is relatively quiet \u2013 numerous empty shops on St James\u2019s Street reflecting problems nationwide \u2013 considering a Premier League game is an hour from kicking off nearby. Yet its football club continues to thrive, not merely survive. Burnley\u2019s Barnfield training ground, its pitches once prone to flooding, has been rebuilt and brought into the 21st century at a cost of more than \u00a310m. The club\u2019s last published accounts, for 2017-18, showed a record profit of \u00a345m and no outstanding bank or directors\u2019 loans. A turnover of \u00a3139m was the joint 13th highest in the Premier League and only two clubs had a smaller wage bill than Burnley\u2019s \u00a382m. Wages have since increased but to progress in a league where Manchester United\u2019s turnover and wage bills were \u00a3590m and \u00a3296m respectively that same season, and to do so for four seasons (one season more than Jimmy Adamson\u2019s team enjoyed in the top flight in the 1970s), is testament to the meticulous planning and decision-making of Dyche and the Burnley board. \u201cThe main thing you have to get right as a chairman is to pick the right manager,\u201d says Mike Garlick, the Burnley chairman. \u201cIf you do that you are halfway there at least. Sean has been key. We had Eddie Howe before that but location-wise it just didn\u2019t suit Eddie and his family, so it didn\u2019t quite work out. Another great manager.\u201d Garlick is speaking in the London office of Michael Bailey Associates, the workforce project management and consulting company he founded in 1989 and now heads as its chief executive officer. His roots are unmistakably Burnley, however, and most of his fellow directors are from the area. The club\u2019s success has been homegrown. \u201cI was born in the town, about 400 yards from the club,\u201d the chairman says. \u201cI went to school there, then went to uni and came to London to seek my fortune. When I was 18 I told my dad I wanted to be chairman of Burnley one day. He said: \u2018You must be bloody crackers son.\u2019 It was a lifelong ambition to do this. I think one of the reasons we do so well is that myself and the other directors are all fairly local and we all really care. We are not there to pick up a wage. No director gets paid. You get a night in a hotel paid for but that\u2019s it. \u201cI proudly state that I am the Premier League\u2019s poorest owner. Everyone else is a billionaire, virtually. But I am proud of that and what we have achieved because we have had to sweat every asset both on and off the pitch to get the best from it. \u201cThat means working really cleverly in the transfer market, looking for value \u2013 and if we don\u2019t see that value we don\u2019t buy. Sometimes that drives the fans up the wall but we have to have value in everything we do. \u201cIt could be a young player that we think could do well for us and we could sell on for a profit or an older player we think could add value to the squad now. All we can do is live within our means. We don\u2019t have the lowest budget in the Premier League any more \u2013 other clubs who have come up have a lower budget this season \u2013 but it is certainly not top half. I can\u2019t go into real detail but we probably have the most aggressive bonus scheme in the league in terms of staying up and finishing higher up the Premier League. We stretch our players as much as we can on the pitch to achieve the best and if they do that they get the rewards.\u201d Garlick recoils at the suggestion that Burnley have established themselves in the Premier League. \u201cNo such thing,\u201d he says but chairman and manager are clearly aligned on what Dyche described as the \u201cincremental improvements\u201d that must be made in a fiercely competitive field. \u201cPriority number one was the training ground,\u201d the chairman says. \u201cPriority number two is probably to expand the corporate facilities because there is a long waiting list.

      "bodyText": "The final report by Indonesian investigators into the crash of a Boeing 737 Max plane flown by Indonesia\u2019s Lion Air that left 189 people dead has found that problems with Boeing\u2019s design, the airline\u2019s maintenance of the jet and pilot errors contributed to the disaster. The report into the October 2018 crash criticised the US planemaker\u2019s new anti-stall system, MCAS, that automatically pushed the plane\u2019s nose down, leaving pilots fighting for control. The 737 Max\u2019s MCAS system is also at the centre of separate investigations into an Ethiopian Airlines crash in March that killed 159 people. Boeing\u2019s 737 Max planes were grounded worldwide following the crashes. The MCAS should be redesigned to include a backup and all systems that can take over flight control should receive closer scrutiny during certification, according to the final report published by the investigators on Friday. \u201cThe investigation considered that the design and certification of this feature was inadequate,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe aircraft flight manual and flight crew training did not include information about MCAS.\u201d The report also found that Boeing failed to detect a software error resulting in a warning light not working and failed to provide pilots with information about the flight control system. \u201cThe absence of guidance on MCAS [\u2026] in the flight manuals and pilot training made it more difficult for flight crews to properly respond to uncommanded MCAS,\u201d said a presentation shown by investigators in Jakarta on Friday. Boeing has already said it plans to remake the system and provide more information about it in pilot manuals. The company still expects the troubled 737 Max jet to return to service by the end of the year. The final report said the first officer onboard was unfamiliar with procedures and had shown issues handling the aircraft during training. The report also found that a critical sensor providing data to an anti-stall system had been miscalibrated by a repair shop in Florida and there were strong indications it had not been tested during installation by Lion Air maintenance staff. Lion Air should have grounded the jet following similar faults on the plane\u2019s previous flight, the report said, adding that 31 pages were missing from the airline\u2019s October maintenance logs. Lion Air did not respond to a request for comment. The Indonesian investigators also made recommendations that regulators, including the US Federal Aviation Administration and its counterpart in Indonesia, improve their oversight over certification and maintenance. The report is one of multiple investigations, including those by US regulators and Congress, faced by Boeing into the crashes of what was previously its most popular plane. The crisis has led Boeing to set aside $4.9bn (\u00a33.8bn) to cover the costs of the groundings. On Wednesday, the company announced it made $20bn in revenues during the third quarter of the year, down by more than a fifth from the previous year. Profits fell by more than 50%. On Friday, Boeing said it had implemented three new software fixes for the MCAS issues that would mean it was not dependent on a single sensor and that would allow a pilot to override it. Boeing has completed a certification test flight with the updates in place. Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing\u2019s chief executive officer, who had the chairmanship removed this month, said: \u201cOn behalf of everyone at Boeing, I want to convey our heartfelt condolences to the families and loved ones of those who lost their lives in these accidents.

Monos depicts the young commandos who have been detailed to guard an American prisoner, connected to a larger, unnamed organisation by \u201cthe Messenger\u201d. A bloodsoaked fever dream. Official Secrets (15) (Gavin Hood, 2019, UK/US) 112 mins A serious-minded account of a major whistleblower scandal: the leak by GCHQ translator Katharine Gun in 2003 that revealed that US spies were putting pressure on their allies to ferret out incriminating material on UN diplomats in the run-up to a vote on invading Iraq. Keira Knightley plays Gun with stern intelligence; Matt Smith a key journalist contact. Terminator: Dark Fate (15) (Tim Miller, 2019, Chi/US) 128 mins You have to think the Terminator is in the last-chance saloon, in franchise terms. Nothing has really worked since James Cameron left, with three successive features failing to deliver the goods. While the hype here was consumed with the return of Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger, the real question will be whether audiences connect with the new human character, played by Natalia Reyes. Hoop Dreams (12) (Steve James, 1994, US) 171 mins The epic basketball doc gets a reissue 25 years on. It follows two high-school prospects over eight years as they battle poverty and the competition to obtain sports scholarships. Its combination of inspirational sports struggle and reportage of the kids\u2019 difficult home lives drew acclaim across the board, although \u2013 controversially \u2013 no best documentary Oscar nomination. Maleficent: Mistress of Evil (PG) (Joachim R\u00f8nning, 2019, US) 119 mins Angelina Jolie does what only she can in this sequel to Disney\u2019s Sleeping Beauty reboot. She leads with those digitally enhanced cheekbones as her Maleficent, after first accommodating to Princess Aurora\u2019s desire to marry handsome human Prince Phillip, then launches into all-out conflict when Phillip\u2019s mother Ingrith (Michelle Pfeiffer) springs her trap. AP Five of the best \u2026 rock &amp; pop Weyes Blood Pennsylvania\u2019s Natalie Mering, AKA Weyes Blood, has always been drawn to heaviness, be it via the underground noise scene she started out in or the weighty lyrical conceits of her four solo albums. This April\u2019s Titanic Rising, whose 70s psych-pop dented the US Top 40, focuses on living under the shadow of impending doom. Dublin, Saturday 26; Glasgow, Monday 28; Manchester, Tuesday 29; London, Wednesday 30 October Charli XCX Last month\u2019s album, Charli, found the Cambridge-born, LA-based pop experimentalist in a state of flux, veering between her weirder mixtape fare and the pure pop rush of her early releases. She still makes most sense live, conjuring up an all-inclusive party atmosphere where each song sounds like an end-of-night anthem. Glasgow Sunday 27; Birmingham Monday 28; Manchester Wednesday 30; London Thursday 31 October Gaika Headlining the Roundhouse Rising festival \u2013 excellent support comes from the likes of Flohio and God Colony \u2013 London\u2019s self-proclaimed \u201cghettofuturist\u201d rapper, who followed up 2018\u2019s Sophie-assisted debut Basic Volume with May\u2019s equally head-spinning mixtape Heaters 4 the 2 Seaters, will be joined by a 10-piece jazz ensemble. As if that weren\u2019t enough, the show also promises a new audiovisual element. Roundhouse, NW1, Tuesday 29 October Marina April\u2019s Love + Fear gave Welsh odd-pop practitioner Marina (now sans \u201cand the Diamonds\u201d) her fourth consecutive UK Top 10 album, a pretty impressive feat for someone always deemed too outre for radio playlists. This latest UK jaunt is her second in a year, so expect a heavily polished skip through a never dull discography.

Vocalists Kurt Elling, Imelda May and Georgie Fame, saxophonist Courtney Pine, and crossover violin virtuoso Nigel Kennedy join a raft of stars on this anniversary gala show. Royal Albert Hall, SW7, Wednesday 30 October JF Three of the best \u2026 classical concerts Sound festival The oboe takes centre stage this year in north-east Scotland\u2019s new-music festival. Oboists Christopher Redgate and Nicholas Daniel are both artists in residence, while visiting groups include the French new-music specialists Ensemble TM+ and the Dutch-based reed quintet Calefax, as well as the Red Note Ensemble and, as a postscript next month, the Hermes Experiment (27 November). There is a portrait concert devoted to John Casken\u2019s music with the Fidelio Trio too, plus premieres from Judith Weir, Tansy Davies, Linda Buckley and Luke Styles.

      "bodyText": "Angus Taylor\u2019s office has left major questions unanswered in its latest attempt to explain allegations it relied on a forged document and false figures for a political attack on the Sydney lord mayor, Clover Moore. Taylor has spent the week embroiled in allegations his office used a false document with grossly inflated figures about the City of Sydney\u2019s travel expenses to attack the council for driving up emissions while claiming to take a stand on climate change. Taylor accused the council of spending \u201c$1.7m on international travel and $14.2m on domestic travel\u201d for councillors. The true figures were $1,727.77 on international travel and $4,206.32 on domestic travel. The figures in question are contained in an annual report on the council\u2019s website. That annual report is available for download in PDF and Word form online. What has Taylor\u2019s response been until this point? Taylor is claiming that his office got the false figures by downloading a version of the annual report from the council\u2019s website last month. This has been hotly disputed by the council, which says the documents have remained unchanged since they were uploaded in November last year with the accurate figures. It has provided metadata and screenshots of the system used to manage its website to corroborate this. What did Taylor say on Friday? Under significant pressure, Taylor issued a statement on Friday afternoon saying he had evidence that suggestions his office doctored the document were \u201coutrageous\u201d and without basis. He said he had \u201cclear evidence\u201d that, contrary to the council\u2019s claims, different versions of the report have existed at various times on its website. To back this up, Taylor\u2019s office produced comparisons between the PDF and Word versions of the annual report as they currently exist on the website. He pointed to minor formatting differences \u2013 mainly different line spacing \u2013 between the Word and PDF versions. Effectively, he is saying there must have been multiple versions of the document uploaded to the website by council because the PDF and Word versions currently online are slightly different. If multiple versions have existed on the website, it leaves open the possibility that his office downloaded some past version of the document containing the false figures. Taylor\u2019s office has left it up to the council to explain what versions existed on its website and when. \u201cClearly, given the document and its various drafts and versions, are on the servers of the City of Sydney, only they can prove which documents have existed, and may still currently exist.\u201d The council has already said the PDF and Word versions have been the same \u2013 completely unchanged \u2013 since November last year. What are the problems with the latest response? The evidence muddies the waters but is likely to do little to resolve the matter. At its most basic, all it shows is there are minor formatting differences between the PDF version and the Word version of the annual report as they currently exist on the council\u2019s website. This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the council has uploaded multiple versions of the document to its website. The formatting differences could be explained by the different versions of Word software used to access the documents. Accessing Word documents using Mac, compared to a PC, can create minor formatting differences. The City of Sydney also says this in its statement: \u201cDifference in formatting occur as a consequence of file export and operating system used to open the documents.\u201d The formatting differences also could have existed in November 2018, when the documents were first uploaded, which would negate the suggestion that the council has been uploading different versions of the report to its website. What didn\u2019t Taylor\u2019s office say? Taylor\u2019s office has not produced direct evidence that he ever downloaded a document with the false figures in it from the council\u2019s website. He has asserted that his office accessed the website on 9 September. The Daily Telegraph says Taylor\u2019s office previously told the paper that it accessed the site on 6 September. But the office has provided neither metadata nor other records to show the document was downloaded on that date. Further, no evidence has been provided that the document ever existed on the council\u2019s website in a form that contained the false figures. Taylor\u2019s office has still not provided evidence to show when and how the document was accessed on the council\u2019s website.",

      "body": "<p>According to Morton, \u201cHalloween is undoubtedly the most misunderstood of festivals\u201d. All Hallows\u2019 Eve (\u201challow\u201d comes from the Old English word <em>h\u00e1lga</em>, or holy) precedes All Saints\u2019 Day, celebrated by Roman Catholics on 1 November. But the origins of Halloween are also pagan. The Celts believed that the doors to the afterlife, known as <em>Tir na tSamhraidh</em> (the Land of Summer), opened on one night of the year, at Samhain.</p> <p>Samhain began at sunset on 31 October and it marked the end of summer, when crops were harvested and animals brought in for the winter. The Celtic festival\u2019s \u201cpeculiar mix of harvest, rowdy celebration and fearful supernatural beliefs\u201d shaped our Halloween.</p> <p>Even though Samhain was superseded by All Saints\u2019 Day and All Souls\u2019 Day (2 November), Halloween still retained \u201ca pagan character\u201d, combining sombre contemplation of death with fun and mischief-making, leading to the tradition of trick or treating which emerged a century ago in the US.</p> <p>Morton\u2019s excellent history explores Halloween\u2019s origins and traditions as well as its place in popular culture, such as<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/21/halloween-2018-review-mark-kermode-jamie-lee-curtis\" title=\"\"> John Carpenter\u2019s \u201cseminal slasher\u201d film <em>Halloween</em></a> (1979).

      "bodyText": "According to Morton, \u201cHalloween is undoubtedly the most misunderstood of festivals\u201d. All Hallows\u2019 Eve (\u201challow\u201d comes from the Old English word h\u00e1lga, or holy) precedes All Saints\u2019 Day, celebrated by Roman Catholics on 1 November. But the origins of Halloween are also pagan. The Celts believed that the doors to the afterlife, known as Tir na tSamhraidh (the Land of Summer), opened on one night of the year, at Samhain. Samhain began at sunset on 31 October and it marked the end of summer, when crops were harvested and animals brought in for the winter. The Celtic festival\u2019s \u201cpeculiar mix of harvest, rowdy celebration and fearful supernatural beliefs\u201d shaped our Halloween. Even though Samhain was superseded by All Saints\u2019 Day and All Souls\u2019 Day (2 November), Halloween still retained \u201ca pagan character\u201d, combining sombre contemplation of death with fun and mischief-making, leading to the tradition of trick or treating which emerged a century ago in the US. Morton\u2019s excellent history explores Halloween\u2019s origins and traditions as well as its place in popular culture, such as John Carpenter\u2019s \u201cseminal slasher\u201d film Halloween (1979). Condemned by some Christian groups as a dangerous celebration of \u201cthe Devil\u2019s Birthday\u201d but embraced as far afield as Hong Kong and Japan, this \u201cmost demonised of days\u201d is, she argues, \u201con the verge of blossoming into a global subculture\u201d. \u2022 Trick or Treat is published by Reaktion (\u00a39.99).",

In the novel, Winter, the daughter of a Brooklyn drug dealer, is a ghetto celebrity and does whatever it takes to keep that status when her family life is fractured.

The book that changed my life Claudia Rankine\u2019s Citizen. Reading it was the first time I recognised that there was a term for what I\u2019d been experiencing for most of my life: micro-aggressions. Realising that the ways white people had spoken to and acted around me was because of societal presumptions about blackness, and had nothing to do with me as a person, lifted a weight.

      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://thebettermentmayfair.com/\" title=\"\">The Betterment</a> sounds like a four-day Californian wellness retreat where everyone floats about in white, floor-length linen and a hose is sporadically placed up your bottom to wash out all the bad juju. The Betterment sounds like a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/gwynethpaltrow\" title=\"\">Gwyneth Paltrow</a> home-learning seminar series, where for $800 you can learn six life-enhancing ways to arrange a radish plate.</p> <p>The Betterment is, in fact, the new restaurant from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/feb/15/jason-atherton-no-tv-dinners-at-our-house-adobo-recipe\" title=\"\">Jason Atherton</a>, who, like the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, now also has an empire that the sun never sets on. Atherton is everywhere in London, and he\u2019s in Shanghai, Dubai, Doha, New York, Cebu and St Moritz, too; doing everything all of the time, excelling at innovative, dramatic cocktails and luxury dining that doesn\u2019t befuddle. He spreads himself thin and aims big, never truly messing up, and never looking anything less than bushy-tailed and dapper in public. This has led me to wonder if there are three, or possibly four, Jason Athertons out there, and if so, one of them is hellbent on incessantly winding up his former employer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/gordonramsay\" title=\"\">Gordon Ramsay</a>.</p> <p>This may well be why Atherton\u2019s newest place is directly opposite Ramsay\u2019s ironically titled Lucky Cat, which I\u2019d rather dine on a Felix duck and lamb in jelly wet pouch than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/jul/26/lucky-cat-london-w1-restaurant-review-grace-dent\" title=\"\">visit again</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/sep/22/chef-jason-atherton-sunday-relaxation-ice-cream-and-bacon-butties\">Sunday with Jason Atherton: \u2018It\u2019s all about rest, relaxation and ice-cream\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>More sensibly, Atherton is a master at choosing and delegating to great staff.

It\u2019s a vast, showy, 251-room, 57-suite luxury, Hilton LXR collection, Mayfair rich-person\u2019s mothership, close to Selfridge\u2019s, where the rooms start at \u00a3600 a night and you\u2019d stay only if money was simply an airy concept over which you heard other people worry.</p> <p>The Betterment, to be blunt, is a slice off the back end of this. In fact, if you\u2019re sitting in its very prettiest, starriest section \u2013 al fresco, under heaters, romantically lit, next to an Instagram hotspot greenery wall \u2013 it will strike you after a while that you\u2019re essentially sitting in a repurposed car park, watching hotel guests arrive and leave. Some of the inside tables, closest to the front of the hotel, are awful, like a drab, grey breakfast room.</p> <p>But I did enjoy The Betterment, and I would go back. It is a new place with old-school glamour, with receptionists in off-the-shoulder LBDs and handsome, besuited males foisting warm sourdough and salted butter under your nose, following on from a cocktail containing something strong with Dubonnet and Silent Pool gin and named Tea Time With The Queen. With dinner, I drank the cheapest Can Sumoi Xarel\u00b7lo at \u00a312 a glass, and well aware that this was possibly disappointing for the sommelier.</p> <p>Our meal is much more hearty than the menu suggests, because on paper it is a cacophony of snow pea, langoustine crudo and horseradish velout\u00e9. In actuality, chalk steam trout and potato cake with curry sauce is a tarted-up fishcake in a puddle of light, coronation-style liquor: delicate, fishy and finickity in design, but still dinner.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0648d86b5cef4b5244f022ecec41619a23fa50a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0648d86b5cef4b5244f022ecec41619a23fa50a2/0_0_5121_3635/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Betterment\u2019s short rib Montgomery cheddar with bone marrow: \u2018an assertive, umami-heavy, emotional battering of meaty, cheesy decadence\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"710\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Betterment\u2019s short rib with bone marrow: \u2018An assertive, umami-heavy, emotional battering of meaty, cheesy decadence.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Robinson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>John dory with a sauce of coco de Paimpol beans and bordelaise sauce is really very little to get het up about.

      "bodyText": "The Betterment sounds like a four-day Californian wellness retreat where everyone floats about in white, floor-length linen and a hose is sporadically placed up your bottom to wash out all the bad juju. The Betterment sounds like a Gwyneth Paltrow home-learning seminar series, where for $800 you can learn six life-enhancing ways to arrange a radish plate. The Betterment is, in fact, the new restaurant from Jason Atherton, who, like the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, now also has an empire that the sun never sets on. Atherton is everywhere in London, and he\u2019s in Shanghai, Dubai, Doha, New York, Cebu and St Moritz, too; doing everything all of the time, excelling at innovative, dramatic cocktails and luxury dining that doesn\u2019t befuddle. He spreads himself thin and aims big, never truly messing up, and never looking anything less than bushy-tailed and dapper in public. This has led me to wonder if there are three, or possibly four, Jason Athertons out there, and if so, one of them is hellbent on incessantly winding up his former employer, Gordon Ramsay. This may well be why Atherton\u2019s newest place is directly opposite Ramsay\u2019s ironically titled Lucky Cat, which I\u2019d rather dine on a Felix duck and lamb in jelly wet pouch than visit again. More sensibly, Atherton is a master at choosing and delegating to great staff. Here, chef Paul Walsh, ex of City Social, and the diligent front-of-house team make what could have been a stiff, corporate-focused, fine-dining borefest into a thoroughly acceptable night. In any other top-name chef\u2019s mitts, The Betterment, inside the The Biltmore hotel on Grosvenor Square, could be a horrible mess, regardless of the steak tartare with beef dripping croutons the size of roast potatoes or the very delicious onion \u201cflower\u201d with chive emulsion (it\u2019s a deep-fried onion, splayed to resemble a sort of floral octopus, with fancy mayo, and definitely a must-order). Nevertheless, the Biltmore is the sort of hotel no one who is remotely from Planet Earth ever stays at. It\u2019s a vast, showy, 251-room, 57-suite luxury, Hilton LXR collection, Mayfair rich-person\u2019s mothership, close to Selfridge\u2019s, where the rooms start at \u00a3600 a night and you\u2019d stay only if money was simply an airy concept over which you heard other people worry. The Betterment, to be blunt, is a slice off the back end of this. In fact, if you\u2019re sitting in its very prettiest, starriest section \u2013 al fresco, under heaters, romantically lit, next to an Instagram hotspot greenery wall \u2013 it will strike you after a while that you\u2019re essentially sitting in a repurposed car park, watching hotel guests arrive and leave. Some of the inside tables, closest to the front of the hotel, are awful, like a drab, grey breakfast room. But I did enjoy The Betterment, and I would go back. It is a new place with old-school glamour, with receptionists in off-the-shoulder LBDs and handsome, besuited males foisting warm sourdough and salted butter under your nose, following on from a cocktail containing something strong with Dubonnet and Silent Pool gin and named Tea Time With The Queen. With dinner, I drank the cheapest Can Sumoi Xarel\u00b7lo at \u00a312 a glass, and well aware that this was possibly disappointing for the sommelier. Our meal is much more hearty than the menu suggests, because on paper it is a cacophony of snow pea, langoustine crudo and horseradish velout\u00e9. In actuality, chalk steam trout and potato cake with curry sauce is a tarted-up fishcake in a puddle of light, coronation-style liquor: delicate, fishy and finickity in design, but still dinner. John dory with a sauce of coco de Paimpol beans and bordelaise sauce is really very little to get het up about. Short-rib with Montgomery cheddar does exactly what it promises: it is an assertive, umami-heavy, emotional battering of bone marrow-encrusted, meaty, cheesy decadence; if you have that with the fried onion and some of The Betterment\u2019s \u201cchips\u201d, which are fried in beef dripping and come with a ketchup laced with truffle, you may find yourself in need of a sedan chair. This won\u2019t be aided by a slice of the generously portioned dark chocolate tart with glorious, deeply scented Tahitian vanilla ice-cream, which I thought to be world-class. Jason Atherton may not have opened the best restaurant in the West End of London this year, but he has opened a more delicious one than Gordon Ramsay. The battle isn\u2019t over, but this time Atherton has got The Betterment of him. \u2022 The Betterment 44 Grosvenor Square, London W1, 020-7596 3200. Open all week, lunch noon-2.30pm, dinner 6-10.30pm. About \u00a370 a head \u00e0 la carte, plus drinks &amp; service. Food 7/10 Atmosphere 7/10 Service 7/10",

The plan \u2013 although nothing has been confirmed \u2013 is to have an extra three sides next year. \u201cIt will happen, it\u2019s a long process, it will be difficult but from what I\u2019ve seen so far in the inaugural season it\u2019s been impressive and the fanbase is there,\u201d Edgar says. \u201cThere are still kinks to work out but if we go onto win this Championship it\u2019s only going to bring more fans to Hamilton and it will be the same for Calgary.\u201d In the short term, Cavalry boosted the league\u2019s profile with a cup win in the Canadian Championship over MLS side Vancouver Whitecaps, much to the surprise of many. \u201cAt first the TV networks weren\u2019t giving us any credit or recognition,\u201d Brown explains. \u201cBefore that Vancouver game on TSN they were saying Vancouver Whitecaps would play \u2018a team from Calgary\u2019, so they didn\u2019t give us the recognition of even calling us by our name. \u201cIn terms of the exposure of our league it was massive, people starting rating us more, especially in our league. People started saying we were the best team and we were carrying the league. It was good for the league but even better for our team, it really put us on the map. I heard rumors after that game that a lot of our players were being looked at by MLS clubs.\u201d With the proof that the top teams can compete with MLS opposition on the pitch, the time has come to prove what can be done off it. The national team has done what it can to advertise soccer in the country, now the domestic game is looking to follow suit and an exciting final could be just the thing to capture the imagination.",

      "body": "<p>It is said that there are times and places where the veil between the material and immaterial worlds grows thin to the point of transparency; at the solstices for instance, or on a ley line where three parishes meet. However that may be, there are undoubtedly points where history gets so close to myth that the two are hard to tell apart, and it is through these shadowlands that Christopher Hadley travels.</p> <p>His starting point is Brent Pelham, a village in Hertfordshire where the 14th-century church of St Mary has a famous tomb slab set into the north wall. Described by Pevsner as \u201cvery remarkable\u201d and by antiquaries over the centuries as \u201ccurious\u201d, \u201cpeculiar\u201d, \u201cinteresting\u201d and other such non-committal adjectives, it shows a dragon under a floriated cross. Above it an angel, surrounded by the symbols of the four evangelists, carries a small figure in a napkin, which is generally agreed to represent a soul ascending to heaven. So much, visible to the naked eye, is undisputed. After that the historical record crumbles. Obvious questions, such as the date of the tomb, its occupant and the meaning of the carving, land the inquirer at once in a maze of controversy, folklore and magic.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>At this point most historians would shrug. Hadley persists, collecting as many versions of the story as he can</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The most often repeated account is that it is the tomb of Piers Shonks, who killed a local dragon, or possibly two local dragons, and died in 1086. The date is too early for the tombstone and indeed for the church. There is evidence of a sort, however, for the dragon \u2013 and this is the first strand that Hadley picks at in the knotted ball of myth and memory. In the early 1830s, close enough in time for the names of individuals to survive, it is recorded that one Thomas Lawrence cut down a yew tree and found, beneath its roots, a dragon\u2019s lair. At this point most historians would shrug and take their inquiries elsewhere. Hadley, however, persists, collecting as many versions of the story as he can, for he is more of an antiquary than a conventional historian. The antiquary is interested in all the remains of the past, whether written records in parish chests and libraries, or fossils or the traditions of folklore. Hadley does not neglect such a humble source as the church\u2019s visitors\u2019 book.</p> <p>When the yew was felled it revealed a large empty hole. Why, Hadley wonders, in the age of gaslight and the Stockton-to-Darlington railway, should the obvious explanation for such a hole be that it was a disused dragon\u2019s lair? In the study of the past there is a delicate but critical balance to be struck between taking the evidence seriously and taking it literally. Hadley strikes it, being neither fanciful on the one side, nor patronising to his subject matter on the other. He talks the reader through his research, the speculations and setbacks, occasionally breaking into excited italics at a particularly good discovery. It probably isn\u2019t a spoiler to say that he doesn\u2019t find a dragon \u2013 he has trouble enough finding the yew. It was, probably, in a field called Great Pepsells, but field patterns have long since vanished and the names have gone with them. Fortunately, however, in the 1930s, when they were still on the cusp of living memory, there was a nationwide project to record them. Schoolchildren were deployed, and by March 1937 the Brent Pelham parish magazine could report that Miss Prior, the local headmistress, and her pupils, had managed to collect them all by interviewing farmers and labourers.</p> <p>The names and accompanying maps were gathered from across England and stored in University College London, where they were all destroyed in the blitz. Luckily, there are copies of the Pelham maps in the church chest at Furneux Pelham, the next parish to Brent, and Hadley is soon poring over them. So it goes in the snakes-and-ladders process of research. The past you find depends on the present you start from, for history is always on the move. Evidence is found and lost and found again. Some details, like the field names, get more sparse over the centuries, while others multiply suspiciously as the outline of a legend is filled in with the retelling.</p> <p>Hadley hacks his way back towards Shonks\u2019s original myth through the later accretions until he gets to the antiquary William Cole, who visited Pelham in 1743 and found them \u201cin a dark state\u201d and \u201cthe people very ignorant\u201d. In Cole\u2019s day there was a \u201ccommon Tradition\u201d that Shonks \u201caccidentally met with a young Devil or Imp which he killed\u201d. By 1827 the story, as published in the twopenny weekly The Mirror of Literature, had acquired the dragon, which Shonks, \u201cchampion of the neighbourhood\u201d went to fight \u201caccompanied by his two favourite dogs\u201d, who were sadly killed in the affray. In 1865 the cast expanded again. The version published in The Reliquary is the literary equivalent of the most drastic kind of Victorian church restoration, in which all that remains of the Middle Ages is obliterated in the name of improvement. Shonks now has a bow and arrow and comes upon the dragon at sunrise \u201ccoiling himself in his tree\u201d. It is a scene from a Burne-Jones tapestry and so, like all the versions of the story, if it gets us no nearer to Shonks, it opens a window on the world of the teller.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/21/best-books-of-the-21st-century\">The 100 best books of the 21st century</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Taking another tack, Hadley pursues the origins of the tombstone itself to the Isle of Purbeck, where it was quarried from open-cast mines. Purbeck marble is not a true marble, but polished and inset among stone columns; it is one of the glories of medieval architecture. In the lower beds where the \u201cbest blue\u201d stone used for the Pelham tomb is found, there are the fossilised footprints of iguanodons, while at ground level the bumps and hollows Hadley walks over indicate where quarries once were. Here then are underground hollows that bear traces of dragons of a sort, which may have got twisted into history. While much remains unexplained, Shonks is eventually tracked down, embedded in the life of the rural Middle Ages, among records of tithes and manorial courts, a \u201csubstantial freeholder\u201d.</p> <p>As Hadley shuttles to and fro between contemporary evidence and the researches and speculations of later centuries, the big events of history roll by in the margins. The Reformation does away with purgatory and prayers for the dead; the civil war does away with statuary and stained glass; and the rationalism of the Enlightenment tries hard to do away with folklore.

      "bodyText": "It is said that there are times and places where the veil between the material and immaterial worlds grows thin to the point of transparency; at the solstices for instance, or on a ley line where three parishes meet. However that may be, there are undoubtedly points where history gets so close to myth that the two are hard to tell apart, and it is through these shadowlands that Christopher Hadley travels. His starting point is Brent Pelham, a village in Hertfordshire where the 14th-century church of St Mary has a famous tomb slab set into the north wall. Described by Pevsner as \u201cvery remarkable\u201d and by antiquaries over the centuries as \u201ccurious\u201d, \u201cpeculiar\u201d, \u201cinteresting\u201d and other such non-committal adjectives, it shows a dragon under a floriated cross. Above it an angel, surrounded by the symbols of the four evangelists, carries a small figure in a napkin, which is generally agreed to represent a soul ascending to heaven. So much, visible to the naked eye, is undisputed. After that the historical record crumbles. Obvious questions, such as the date of the tomb, its occupant and the meaning of the carving, land the inquirer at once in a maze of controversy, folklore and magic. The most often repeated account is that it is the tomb of Piers Shonks, who killed a local dragon, or possibly two local dragons, and died in 1086. The date is too early for the tombstone and indeed for the church. There is evidence of a sort, however, for the dragon \u2013 and this is the first strand that Hadley picks at in the knotted ball of myth and memory. In the early 1830s, close enough in time for the names of individuals to survive, it is recorded that one Thomas Lawrence cut down a yew tree and found, beneath its roots, a dragon\u2019s lair. At this point most historians would shrug and take their inquiries elsewhere. Hadley, however, persists, collecting as many versions of the story as he can, for he is more of an antiquary than a conventional historian. The antiquary is interested in all the remains of the past, whether written records in parish chests and libraries, or fossils or the traditions of folklore. Hadley does not neglect such a humble source as the church\u2019s visitors\u2019 book. When the yew was felled it revealed a large empty hole. Why, Hadley wonders, in the age of gaslight and the Stockton-to-Darlington railway, should the obvious explanation for such a hole be that it was a disused dragon\u2019s lair? In the study of the past there is a delicate but critical balance to be struck between taking the evidence seriously and taking it literally. Hadley strikes it, being neither fanciful on the one side, nor patronising to his subject matter on the other. He talks the reader through his research, the speculations and setbacks, occasionally breaking into excited italics at a particularly good discovery. It probably isn\u2019t a spoiler to say that he doesn\u2019t find a dragon \u2013 he has trouble enough finding the yew. It was, probably, in a field called Great Pepsells, but field patterns have long since vanished and the names have gone with them. Fortunately, however, in the 1930s, when they were still on the cusp of living memory, there was a nationwide project to record them. Schoolchildren were deployed, and by March 1937 the Brent Pelham parish magazine could report that Miss Prior, the local headmistress, and her pupils, had managed to collect them all by interviewing farmers and labourers. The names and accompanying maps were gathered from across England and stored in University College London, where they were all destroyed in the blitz. Luckily, there are copies of the Pelham maps in the church chest at Furneux Pelham, the next parish to Brent, and Hadley is soon poring over them. So it goes in the snakes-and-ladders process of research. The past you find depends on the present you start from, for history is always on the move. Evidence is found and lost and found again. Some details, like the field names, get more sparse over the centuries, while others multiply suspiciously as the outline of a legend is filled in with the retelling. Hadley hacks his way back towards Shonks\u2019s original myth through the later accretions until he gets to the antiquary William Cole, who visited Pelham in 1743 and found them \u201cin a dark state\u201d and \u201cthe people very ignorant\u201d. In Cole\u2019s day there was a \u201ccommon Tradition\u201d that Shonks \u201caccidentally met with a young Devil or Imp which he killed\u201d. By 1827 the story, as published in the twopenny weekly The Mirror of Literature, had acquired the dragon, which Shonks, \u201cchampion of the neighbourhood\u201d went to fight \u201caccompanied by his two favourite dogs\u201d, who were sadly killed in the affray. In 1865 the cast expanded again. The version published in The Reliquary is the literary equivalent of the most drastic kind of Victorian church restoration, in which all that remains of the Middle Ages is obliterated in the name of improvement. Shonks now has a bow and arrow and comes upon the dragon at sunrise \u201ccoiling himself in his tree\u201d. It is a scene from a Burne-Jones tapestry and so, like all the versions of the story, if it gets us no nearer to Shonks, it opens a window on the world of the teller. Taking another tack, Hadley pursues the origins of the tombstone itself to the Isle of Purbeck, where it was quarried from open-cast mines. Purbeck marble is not a true marble, but polished and inset among stone columns; it is one of the glories of medieval architecture. In the lower beds where the \u201cbest blue\u201d stone used for the Pelham tomb is found, there are the fossilised footprints of iguanodons, while at ground level the bumps and hollows Hadley walks over indicate where quarries once were. Here then are underground hollows that bear traces of dragons of a sort, which may have got twisted into history. While much remains unexplained, Shonks is eventually tracked down, embedded in the life of the rural Middle Ages, among records of tithes and manorial courts, a \u201csubstantial freeholder\u201d. As Hadley shuttles to and fro between contemporary evidence and the researches and speculations of later centuries, the big events of history roll by in the margins. The Reformation does away with purgatory and prayers for the dead; the civil war does away with statuary and stained glass; and the rationalism of the Enlightenment tries hard to do away with folklore. He pieces together what remains and gradually, like a jumpy piece of early film, time speeds up. The Swing riots rage through the countryside in the 1820s; antiquaries come and go, drawing the tomb; Pelham is startled by surveyors working on the first Ordnance Survey, who appear with a vast horse-drawn theodolite, until gradually modernity dawns. Hadley wears his scholarship lightly but at the heart of this antiquarian wild goose chase is an ingenious meditation on what history, in all its complexity and unevenness, really is. \u2022 Hollow Places: An Unusual History of Land and Legend by Christopher Hadley is published by William Collins (RRP \u00a320) To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com or call 020-3176 3837.

Nevertheless, Cigarettes After Sex \u2013 if you prefer melody and softness to rhythm and abrasion \u2013 are one of the most sonically pleasurable groups of recent years. These are sturdily constructed songs, which would work in other arrangements, and they are presented in such a way that the instrumentation ornaments rather than overwhelms them. Heavenly might be the nearest we get to evolution \u2013 it owes at least as much to mid-80s MOR as it does to Mazzy Star, albeit MOR with the rock and mullets removed \u2013 but the lack of innovation doesn\u2019t matter when you\u2019ve got melodies as simple and lovely as the title track to fall back on. Gonzalez\u2019s failure to evolve lyrically is more of an issue. The first album and the early EPs were, apparently, inspired by heartbreak. He\u2019s said the second album is autobiographical, too, which suggests he\u2019s having more of a wallow than is seemly in your late 30s. His writing still reads like that of a man who doesn\u2019t have a filter \u2013 not in a good way. He evidently spends a lot of time using his computer with one hand: Hentai opens with him reminiscing about a first encounter with one woman, an encounter he chose to spend telling her about some porn he\u2019d watched. In You\u2019re the Only Good Thing in My Life, his girlfriend is \u201cposing as a Playboy centrefold\u201d, which causes him to forget the rivalry between Hugh Hefner and Bob Guccione and observe: \u201cYou could be my Penthouse pet.\u201d I suspect it\u2019s meant to be honest and open, but it just feels icky. Then the melodies overwhelm the words, and you forgive him. Just about.",

Her death made her the seventh candidate to be murdered in advance of local elections this Sunday for governors, mayors, and city councillors across Colombia. The string of political killings has shaken the country, reminding many of the wanton political violence of past decades, when thousands of candidates \u2013 including three presidential contenders \u2013 were killed on the campaign trail. A 2016 peace deal with the leftwing rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) was supposed to usher in a new chapter of tranquility, formally ending half a century of civil war that killed 260,000 and forced over 7 million from their homes. But while the Farc demobilization removed one faction from Colombia\u2019s labyrinthine war \u2013 and an overarching narrative for the violence \u2013 peace never truly arrived: local conflicts over the drug trade, land rights and mineral resources continue to fuel violence. According to Colombia\u2019s human rights ombudsman, 486 activists and human rights defenders have been murdered since January 2016, most of them in rural areas like Su\u00e1rez, where dissident rebel groups, local mafias and drug traffickers with paramilitary origins still jostle for strategic territory and economic and political power. \u201cSu\u00e1rez has always had its problems.

They\u2019re supposed to give the viewer a peek behind the curtain: come see what\u2019s <em>really </em>happening, yet they rarely inform the viewer. The really interesting parts \u2013 the play-calling, the foul-mouthed outbursts, the moments that show players as anything other than dedicated to the league and its product \u2013 are airbrushed out because the NFL wants to present a wholesome product. Packaging a game built atop testosterone, arrogance and violence to middle America requires such finagling of footage \u2013 NFL Films decides what audio it passes on to the broadcaster, so the audience hears only a very small fraction of what goes on during a game.</p> <p>And so we hear the platitudes and coach-speak. We get the sweet, pregame interactions between teammates, players of the past or guests of honor. We get the whooping and hollering. And we get the clapping \u2013 so much clapping. And yet, every now and then, something slips past the censors.</p> <p>On Monday night, New York Jets quarterback Sam Darnold played his worst game as a pro, committing five turnovers against the New England Patriots. In the second quarter, after his third giveaway, he went to the sideline and said, \u201cI\u2019m seeing ghosts.\u201d The clip instantly <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RochieWBZ/status/1186455154024951808\">went viral</a>.

Darnold is only in his second season as a professional, and Belichick has confused and clobbered the game\u2019s best for decades. The list of quarterbacks he has outwitted is littered with Hall of Famers: Peyton Manning, Kurt Warner, Jim Kelly, and on and on.

      "bodyText": "The NFL\u2019s \u201cMic\u2019d Up\u201d segments, in which we\u2019re given audio of individual players during a game, are an odd concept. They\u2019re supposed to give the viewer a peek behind the curtain: come see what\u2019s really happening, yet they rarely inform the viewer. The really interesting parts \u2013 the play-calling, the foul-mouthed outbursts, the moments that show players as anything other than dedicated to the league and its product \u2013 are airbrushed out because the NFL wants to present a wholesome product. Packaging a game built atop testosterone, arrogance and violence to middle America requires such finagling of footage \u2013 NFL Films decides what audio it passes on to the broadcaster, so the audience hears only a very small fraction of what goes on during a game. And so we hear the platitudes and coach-speak. We get the sweet, pregame interactions between teammates, players of the past or guests of honor. We get the whooping and hollering. And we get the clapping \u2013 so much clapping. And yet, every now and then, something slips past the censors. On Monday night, New York Jets quarterback Sam Darnold played his worst game as a pro, committing five turnovers against the New England Patriots. In the second quarter, after his third giveaway, he went to the sideline and said, \u201cI\u2019m seeing ghosts.\u201d The clip instantly went viral. Darnold essentially admitted he was out of his depth against New England coach Bill Belichick, as was evident to anyone with eyes. Why Darnold\u2019s admission sent the Jets into such a tizzy \u2013 they were said to be furious that his comments were aired \u2013 is interesting. Was such a revelation a shock? Of course Darnold was confused by the Patriots. They have the best defense in football and are coached by Belichick, the greatest defensive mind in league history. Darnold is only in his second season as a professional, and Belichick has confused and clobbered the game\u2019s best for decades. The list of quarterbacks he has outwitted is littered with Hall of Famers: Peyton Manning, Kurt Warner, Jim Kelly, and on and on. Warner himself came to Darnold\u2019s defense, saying even the best quarterbacks sometimes find themselves dazed and confused during games. If someone uses Darnold\u2019s in-the-moment doubts to evaluate his long-term prospects or overall talent, more fool them. Darnold admitting his confusion was the most illuminating thing from a Monday Night Football broadcast in years. Rather than see that as a positive, network execs will kowtow to the league \u2013 who wield the leverage of future TV contracts and competition from tech giants Amazon, Apple, Twitter and Facebook \u2013 and become even more reserved. The Jets are already rethinking wearing microphones, according to the New York Times. Jets head coach Adam Gase put a voice to the concerns. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever seen that,\u201d Gase said. \u201cWhere somebody that was mic\u2019d up was basically ... a comment like that was allowed to air.\u201d What drivel. It\u2019s rare that we get quality mic\u2019d up segments, but when we do, they\u2019re doozies. Darnold\u2019s, in terms of its impact, has already entered the pantheon. Here are a few more classics. 1) Bill Belichick and Chad Ochocinco Belichick is a first-ballot Hall of Fame mic\u2019d up participant.

Touchdown. 5) Lamar Jackson Lamar Jackson had a monumental day against the Seahawks last Sunday, showing the kind of traits that make a great player great but don\u2019t always show up in the box score. When the Ravens needed him to put the team on his back, on the road, in a hostile environment, against a swarming defense, he did so on back-to-back drives. It was a transformative game for the much-criticized quarterback, and it came with its own Hollywood moment.

He has commitment issues on Never Had the Balls and a frustrating video-call affair on Face to Face, and a series of phoney friends. As with a six-part message from a softboi, you\u2019re tempted to roll your eyes at these trials, but this stuff hurts when you\u2019re not old enough to shrug it off, and the bruise that seems to sit under his voice is often affecting.</p> <p>The youthful tendency to overthink things spills into the music, which is sometimes a little fussy \u2013 It Gets Better is series of great ideas whose pacing is all off, and the circuitous melody of 10/10 only just stays on the road. He\u2019s better when the pace drops, relaxing into a classic in Always. His songcraft is distinctive, a blend of Ed Sheeran white rap with the nerdy piano pop of Ben Folds or Randy Newman, but some of his influences remain extremely stark: Laser Lights\u2019 chatty verses are very Chance the Rapper, and Frank Ocean\u2019s Solo feels like a constant touchstone.

They have found their patron saint in Rex Orange County, 21-year-old English singer-songwriter Alexander O\u2019Connor. The breezy romance of his defining hit thus far, Loving is Easy, has curdled. \u201cI care about you, in every way I can\u201d, he sings, and it feels more like a caveat than an assurance. He has commitment issues on Never Had the Balls and a frustrating video-call affair on Face to Face, and a series of phoney friends. As with a six-part message from a softboi, you\u2019re tempted to roll your eyes at these trials, but this stuff hurts when you\u2019re not old enough to shrug it off, and the bruise that seems to sit under his voice is often affecting. The youthful tendency to overthink things spills into the music, which is sometimes a little fussy \u2013 It Gets Better is series of great ideas whose pacing is all off, and the circuitous melody of 10/10 only just stays on the road. He\u2019s better when the pace drops, relaxing into a classic in Always. His songcraft is distinctive, a blend of Ed Sheeran white rap with the nerdy piano pop of Ben Folds or Randy Newman, but some of his influences remain extremely stark: Laser Lights\u2019 chatty verses are very Chance the Rapper, and Frank Ocean\u2019s Solo feels like a constant touchstone. His writing can still mature, then, but hopefully his heart won\u2019t harden.",

Brittany pulls on her trainers, steps away from social media and changes her life. \u201cShe was flawed, and joyful,\u201d says Bell. \u201cIn pain and then hilarious the next moment.\u201d She is, she says, unlike anyone she has played before.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"91c908885219eb0410170f5d357ecd31e8b9b7a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91c908885219eb0410170f5d357ecd31e8b9b7a6/0_0_1143_762/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bell as Brittany.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bell as Brittany.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The film carefully negotiates its way around fat-shaming territory, not subscribing to the idea that life becomes perfect once you achieve your target weight. \u201cBrittany realises it was never about losing weight, it was about growing up and taking ownership for yourself,\u201d says Bell, who lost about 18kg before and during the shoot; she wore padding for the marathon scenes (she didn\u2019t run the whole thing, in fact) because the film-makers were concerned she looked too slim. \u201cBut we were not going to shy away from how society treats you if you lose weight, and how that can sometimes seep into your own values.\u201d</p> <p>In one scene \u2013 which Bell says is the hardest thing she has ever shot \u2013 Brittany is unspeakably cruel to a woman larger than herself.

They want to make sure that all the women are very likable and I think that\u2019s unfair because we\u2019ve had a lot of male characters who are incredibly unlikable that we root for. I\u2019m hoping women start to do that more: play characters who are flawed and make mistakes.\u201d</p> <p>Since the 28-day shoot, Bell has regained about half the weight she lost and feels, she says, \u201cmore like myself\u201d. She is overweight only by Hollywood standards. To anyone else, she looks, sitting in a black jumpsuit on a sofa, a plate of biscuits between us, completely normal \u2013 albeit wildly pretty. </p> <p>Yet Bell has struggled with her body image. She wasn\u2019t sure if making the film would help, or exacerbate the problem. \u201cThere\u2019s only so much you can shake off the character. You have to figure out what your own story is. And [after making the film] I feel I\u2019m in a much better place.

To look at all the seeds that have been planted in my brain from a very young age of what women should look like, and re-examine those thoughts and see if they\u2019re feeding me or not?

      "bodyText": "When Jillian Bell was filmed by a small movie crew running the New York marathon last year, onlookers assumed she was doing it for real. Some recognised the actor, others just clapped and cheered anyway. Bell, now 35, has spent the past 10 years as a secret weapon, briefly unleashed, in a series of big Hollywood comedies (and a couple of Paul Thomas Anderson pictures). She was a withering bridal shower guest in Bridesmaids, an unlikely pimp in Office Christmas Party and, most memorably, a stunningly insulting and deadpan foil to Jonah Hill in 22 Jump Street. That film was a showcase for Bell\u2019s particular gift: extra-dry delivery of wildly strange dialogue, much of it improvised. \u201cJillian makes me want to quit show business and realise I am a complete fraud,\u201d said Hill during the press tour, \u201cbecause she is the funniest person I have ever met in my life.\u201d Jump Street took $330m (\u00a3256m); prospects are rather more modest for her first film as a lead, Brittany Runs a Marathon, about which critical buzz has gathered pace since its debut at Sundance earlier this year. Loosely based on a friend of the film\u2019s writer-director, Paul Downs Colaizzo, Brittany is a New Yorker in her late 20s, mired in toxic relationships and self-destruction. Attempting to score some prescription drugs from a doctor, she is informed that she is dangerously overweight and urgently needs to lose 40lb (18kg).

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s a Saturday morning and I\u2019m still in bed. My partner is downstairs, reading. We are house-sitting for some friends in a small village outside of Cambridge; it\u2019s a nice break, given the hectic last few months of our lives. I roll over, check my phone, open Twitter. Oh no, I think: again?</p> <p>It had just been reported that Trinity Hall college at Cambridge University had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/20/cambridge-harassment-row-fuels-call-to-reform-colleges-system\" title=\"\">changed its agreement with former lecturer Dr Peter Hutchinson</a>. Previously it had been agreed that he would not attend undergraduate social events and retire, after 10 women submitted complaints of sexual harassment against him (Hutchinson apologised for his \u201cinappropriate\u201d behaviour). Hutchinson has now had his dining rights as an Emeritus fellow reinstated, and is allowed to attend certain college events once more.</p> <p>Cambridge has come under scrutiny this summer after a <a href=\"https://www.varsity.co.uk/news/17734\" title=\"\">change in its definition of sexual harassment</a>, so that it no longer included sexual misconduct. This change has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jul/31/cambridge-sexual-misconduct-rule-change-branded-unlawful\" title=\"\">described as \u201cunlawful\u201d</a> by legal experts and advocacy groups \u2013 and has resulted in <a href=\"https://www.varsity.co.uk/news/17737\" title=\"\">at least two</a> complaints being dropped. Shortly after this, <a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/news/new-cambridge-university-harassment-allegations\" title=\"\">I went public with my experience</a> of the university\u2019s disciplinary procedures after I made a complaint of sexual harassment against one of my supervisors, and spoke about the subsequent legal case I am taking against them.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Institutions have the freedom to create  procedures run by academics who are not qualified to investigate complaints</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As I read further about the case <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/oct/22/cambridge-isnt-the-only-university-to-fail-at-handling-sexual-misconduct-complaints\" title=\"\">at Trinity Hall</a>, I experienced a sense of deja vu, even though my experience was at a different college and I submitted my complaint to the university rather than my college. Decisions are shrouded in secrecy: the women who complained about Hutchinson weren\u2019t informed of this change to Trinity Hall\u2019s agreement, and similarly, I was denied access to the majority of the documentation pertaining to my case. These decisions suggest a lack of proper regard for student safety: Hutchinson is allowed back to certain events, just as the supervisor I complained about was allowed to continue teaching. Finally, women in the Hutchinson case were told <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-50089170\" title=\"\">not to discuss it with the student body</a>, just as I was threatened with disciplinary action if I spoke about my case.</p> <p>Since going public, I have received messages from about a hundred students \u2013 current and former students of Cambridge, and some from other universities \u2013 recounting similar experiences ranging from dissatisfaction with, to additional trauma from, the way that higher education institutions deal with complaints of sexual misconduct. The decision made this week by Trinity Hall echoes the decision made by Warwick University to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jan/31/women-terrified-as-students-can-return-after-messages\" title=\"\">reverse the 10-year campus ban</a> placed on students who had sent messages about raping and assaulting women, including fellow students.</p> <p>I wasn\u2019t surprised to hear that Trinity Hall had changed its agreement with Hutchinson: it seems to me this isn\u2019t an exception, but the rule. Hutchinson isn\u2019t a one-off \u201cbad apple\u201d, the whole system is rotting.</p> <p>Reports of sexual misconduct in UK higher education are on the rise. But that isn\u2019t the scandal here \u2013 we want students to be reporting these incidences, so that they can be properly investigated and dealt with. The scandal is that that isn\u2019t happening. At best, complaints procedures are lengthy, tiring and dissatisfying. At worst, they subject vulnerable students to revictimisation, retaliation and retraumatisation. There is often no provision for appealing the decision: in my case, I had no right of appeal at all.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/20/cambridge-harassment-row-fuels-call-to-reform-colleges-system\">Cambridge harassment row fuels calls to reform college system</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Universities are failing in their duty of care to provide fair, transparent and accessible disciplinary procedures. They are failing victims largely because they can; thus far there have been no consequences to their institutional failures, which allows their fear of tackling the prolific issue of sexual misconduct on their campuses to dominate.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s a Saturday morning and I\u2019m still in bed. My partner is downstairs, reading. We are house-sitting for some friends in a small village outside of Cambridge; it\u2019s a nice break, given the hectic last few months of our lives. I roll over, check my phone, open Twitter. Oh no, I think: again? It had just been reported that Trinity Hall college at Cambridge University had changed its agreement with former lecturer Dr Peter Hutchinson. Previously it had been agreed that he would not attend undergraduate social events and retire, after 10 women submitted complaints of sexual harassment against him (Hutchinson apologised for his \u201cinappropriate\u201d behaviour). Hutchinson has now had his dining rights as an Emeritus fellow reinstated, and is allowed to attend certain college events once more. Cambridge has come under scrutiny this summer after a change in its definition of sexual harassment, so that it no longer included sexual misconduct. This change has been described as \u201cunlawful\u201d by legal experts and advocacy groups \u2013 and has resulted in at least two complaints being dropped. Shortly after this, I went public with my experience of the university\u2019s disciplinary procedures after I made a complaint of sexual harassment against one of my supervisors, and spoke about the subsequent legal case I am taking against them. As I read further about the case at Trinity Hall, I experienced a sense of deja vu, even though my experience was at a different college and I submitted my complaint to the university rather than my college. Decisions are shrouded in secrecy: the women who complained about Hutchinson weren\u2019t informed of this change to Trinity Hall\u2019s agreement, and similarly, I was denied access to the majority of the documentation pertaining to my case. These decisions suggest a lack of proper regard for student safety: Hutchinson is allowed back to certain events, just as the supervisor I complained about was allowed to continue teaching. Finally, women in the Hutchinson case were told not to discuss it with the student body, just as I was threatened with disciplinary action if I spoke about my case. Since going public, I have received messages from about a hundred students \u2013 current and former students of Cambridge, and some from other universities \u2013 recounting similar experiences ranging from dissatisfaction with, to additional trauma from, the way that higher education institutions deal with complaints of sexual misconduct. The decision made this week by Trinity Hall echoes the decision made by Warwick University to reverse the 10-year campus ban placed on students who had sent messages about raping and assaulting women, including fellow students. I wasn\u2019t surprised to hear that Trinity Hall had changed its agreement with Hutchinson: it seems to me this isn\u2019t an exception, but the rule. Hutchinson isn\u2019t a one-off \u201cbad apple\u201d, the whole system is rotting. Reports of sexual misconduct in UK higher education are on the rise. But that isn\u2019t the scandal here \u2013 we want students to be reporting these incidences, so that they can be properly investigated and dealt with. The scandal is that that isn\u2019t happening. At best, complaints procedures are lengthy, tiring and dissatisfying. At worst, they subject vulnerable students to revictimisation, retaliation and retraumatisation. There is often no provision for appealing the decision: in my case, I had no right of appeal at all. Universities are failing in their duty of care to provide fair, transparent and accessible disciplinary procedures. They are failing victims largely because they can; thus far there have been no consequences to their institutional failures, which allows their fear of tackling the prolific issue of sexual misconduct on their campuses to dominate. In the Trinity Hall case, the college is an autonomous legal entity from Cambridge University, and Cambridge has denied any responsibility for the college\u2019s decisions. Similarly, UK universities and colleges have not been held accountable for their inaction. There exists no compulsory, standardised procedure for investigating sexual misconduct in higher education, and this gives institutions the freedom to create quasi-legal procedures often run by poorly trained, over-worked academics who are not qualified to investigate such complaints. Despite a claim by the Office for Students \u2013 the independent regulator of higher education in England \u2013 that it would intervene in \u201cserious examples of universities failing to address these issues seriously\u201d, this has yet to transpire, despite the major failings we\u2019ve seen. I wasn\u2019t surprised when I read about what happened at Trinity Hall. Until there is legislation that outlines how these procedures must be run, universities will not be an environment in which victims can find justice. \u2022 Danielle Bradford is a former student of Cambridge University.

      "bodyText": "The 39 people who were found dead in a refrigerated lorry trailer in Essex on Wednesday were already trapped when they arrived at the Belgian coast en route to England, local officials have said, as police confirmed that the victims were all Chinese nationals. The Belgian officials said the eight women and 31 men would have been locked in the trailer at temperatures as low as -25C for at least 10 hours after the trailer arrived at the port of Zeebrugge on Tuesday afternoon. As the investigation gathered pace, police secured an additional 24 hours to question a lorry driver arrested at the scene of the discovery, and inquiries broadened to involve the authorities in Ireland, Belgium and China. The Irish company that owns the trailer said it was cooperating with police and insisted it had no connection to the driver, 25-year-old Mo Robinson. One report claimed detectives were focusing on three suspected gang members based in Northern Ireland near the border. The Daily Telegraph cited security sources saying they were concentrating on a criminal gang based in south Armagh with links to dissident paramilitaries. The chief executive of Zeebrugge port, Joachim Coens, said the trailer would not have been interfered with after it arrived there at 2.49pm. \u201cA refrigerated container in the port zone is completely sealed,\u201d he told Belgian media. \u201cDuring the check, the seal is examined, as is the licence plate. The driver is checked by cameras.\u201d The mayor of Bruges, Dirk de Fauw, echoed this message in an interview on VRT, saying trailers were filmed until their arrival on the ferry. \u201c[To] break the seal, bring 39 people onboard and apply a new seal without being noticed, that chance is extremely small.\u201d The comments, along with the news that the victims were Chinese, strengthened suspicions that it could be a case of trafficking. Experts said the majority of Chinese people brought to the UK illegally found themselves in a situation of debt bondage when they reached the country. New details of the journeys taken by the trailer and cab emerged, raising further questions about when and where the victims were locked inside the trailer and by whom. The refrigerated trailer compartment arrived unaccompanied in the UK from Zeebrugge early on Wednesday morning and was collected at the port of Purfleet at 1.05am by a lorry cab driven by Robinson, a self-employed haulier from Northern Ireland. Police said Robinson\u2019s burgundy cab arrived at Holyhead by ferry from Dublin on Sunday. The trailer had been leased five days earlier in County Monaghan, just south of the Irish border, a spokesman for Global Trailer Rentals (GTR), the operating company, confirmed. Local sources said Robinson\u2019s parents, who live in the village of Laurelvale, had travelled to England to visit their son at the request of the Police Service of Northern Ireland. Three properties in Northern Ireland \u2013 Robinson\u2019s home, a nearby property he used to share with his parents and a third site in Armagh \u2013 were raided overnight. Computers were taken away as part of the investigation, sources said. The first bodies of the victims were removed by ambulance on Thursday night from the dockyard warehouse where the vehicle was being examined, and taken by ambulance to hospital in Chelmsford where they will undergo postmortems. Essex police indicated that the process of recovering the bodies could take longer than anticipated. BJ Harrington, the force\u2019s chief constable, said: \u201cThis is the largest investigation of its kind Essex police has ever had to conduct and it is likely to take some considerable time to come to a conclusion.\u201d Liu Xiaoming, Chinese ambassador to the UK, tweeted: \u201cThe Chinese embassy has sent a team led by the minister-counsellor in charge of consular affairs to Essex, England.

It said in a statement: \u201cThe directors of Global Trailer Rentals Limited wish to express their deepest sympathies with the family and friends of the people who have so tragically lost their lives. The company was entirely unaware that the trailer was to be used in the manner in which it appears to have been.\u201d The statement said GTR had supplied information to Essex police, including the identity of the client who rented the trailer, and it would supply data from the tracking device upon request.

      "body": "<p>Olive Kitteridge doesn\u2019t much like Betty, the \u201cnursing aide\u201d assigned to her after her heart attack. She dislikes Betty for the hostility with which she treats the other carer, a Somali woman. She dislikes her for her Republican bumper sticker. She really, really dislikes her for having dropped the cigarette butt that caused Olive to bend over, get dizzy and fall and subsequently decide she\u2019d better move into sheltered housing. But when one day Betty shows up crying over the death of the headteacher on whom she had a crush, back when Olive was teaching her maths in high school, Olive softens. She hands her a Kleenex and asks about her life. \u201c\u2018It sucks,\u201d says Betty. Olive wants more. \u201cOh it\u2019s just a life,\u201d says Betty. \u201cOlive thought about this. She said: \u2018Well, it\u2019s your life. It matters.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The town of Crosby, Maine, in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/02/elizabeth-strout-war-peace-books-that-made-me\" title=\"\">Elizabeth Strout</a> set her acclaimed story-sequence-cum-novel <em>Olive Kitteridge</em> and now sets this sequel, <em>Olive, Again</em>, lies on a beautiful stretch of coast; it is remote, provincial, very far from centres of power or fashion or big business. It\u2019s just a place, as Betty\u2019s life (two disastrous marriages, brain-damaged son, dire poverty) is \u201cjust a life\u201d, but Strout persuades us that Crosby matters, and so do its people.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Within these taut, laconic little tales, there is room for characters to show feeling from several levels of their being</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s not only that this small town is the setting for high drama. Even though everyone knows everyone else\u2019s business, murder, paedophilia, suicide, armed robbery, arson and hostage-taking all take place in Crosby, and so do heartbreak and true love. More important, though, than Crosby having its share of the stuff of which flashier drama is made, is Strout\u2019s careful attention to the humdrum, quotidian experience that gradually accretes grandeur simply by dint of going on and on through decades. Banal loss (children growing up and moving away) becomes tragic, and the pleasure of a haphazardly begun new friendship between two incontinent old women seems as redemptive as romantic love.</p> <p>Strout has been revisiting these themes in her meticulous realist fiction through half a dozen books now. They are all admirably accomplished, written with sharp-witted exactitude, if sometimes almost too spare. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/05/my-name-is-lucy-barton-by-eliabeth-strout-review\" title=\"\"><em>My Name Is Lucy Barton</em></a>, from 2016, much admired by some, was too arid for my taste, its self-pitying heroine too unpleasant. But Strout can go emotionally large as well. In Olive Kitteridge she created a character so vital, so funny, so exasperating and yet so winning that Olive lights up a story even when she is only glimpsed in the distance, a hand waved over her head in her signature gesture.</p> <p>When we first met her, in late middle age, Olive had no brakes, no filter. She said what she thought, without pausing to wonder how hurtful, or how wrong, she might be. Her husband Henry said to her once, not so much in reproach as in weariness, \u201cI don\u2019t believe you\u2019ve ever once apologised. For anything.\u201d Everything that goes wrong is someone else\u2019s fault. Everyone else is stupid. \u201cStupid\u201d is one of Olive\u2019s favourite words. Another, expressive of her defensive dismissal of anything that makes her uneasy, is \u201cphooey\u201d. In the earlier book, a couple are at a concert when they see Olive come in with Henry. \u201cI don\u2019t know how he can stand her,\u201d says the man. \u201cHe loves her,\u201d says the woman. \u201cThat\u2019s how he can stand her.\u201d Readers love her too.</p> <p>Her story, the very opposite of the conventional coming-of-age narrative, is about the coming of age. At the end of <em>Olive Kitteridge</em>, published 11 years ago, we left her in her 70s, lying on a bed alongside a man, Jack, widowed like her, and as \u201cold, big and sagging\u201d as she was. \u201cOlive pictured two slices of Swiss cheese pressed together, such holes they brought to this union \u2013 what pieces life took out of you.\u201d As <em>Olive, Again </em>opens, only a month has passed. After a lot of predictable contrariness on Olive\u2019s part, she and Jack manage to get together. And then Olive is once again alone.</p> <p>These books are structured as collections of linked stories, but Strout\u2019s publisher calls them novels. It might be more accurate to say they are the prose-narrative equivalent of a long-running TV drama series. Characters (many of them familiar from earlier books) step into the foreground to star in their own stories, then recede, to be glimpsed much later, their lives having moved on in the meantime. However you choose to classify them, though, the Olive collections have the amplitude and emotional subtlety of the most generously comprehensive novels. Within the span of these taut, laconic little tales there is room for characters to show feeling from several levels of their being \u2013 only some of which they are aware of. They develop. They change their minds. Olive herself says, tentatively, in one of the stories from this latest batch, that she thinks she may have become a bit nicer, and it\u2019s true. She has. She grows old, as few fictional heroines do, while we witness the indignities, terrors and frustrations attendant on that process. Without labouring the point at all, for her authorial voice is always detached, never didactic, Strout shows how age has weakened what was most exasperating about Olive \u2013 her always-rightness, her irascibility \u2013 while leaving her bracing humour intact.</p> <p>In one story she attends a baby shower. A young pregnant woman sits in a garlanded chair while her female friends give her the paraphernalia she is going to need when the baby is born. There is a lot of cooing and exclaiming as the presents \u2013 feeding bottles, tiny garments \u2013 are passed around. Olive gets increasingly irritable: the thing that drives her mad is the way the mother-to-be puts aside the ribbons off each pretty parcel, taping them to a paper plate. Is it the parsimony she can\u2019t stand, or the time-wasting pernicketiness that prolongs the \u201cstupid\u201d ceremony, or the way the occasion forces her to contemplate her own failures as a mother? We aren\u2019t told. Strout, beady-eyed, observes and records every fluctuation in Olive\u2019s mood, but leaves us to interpret them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/02/elizabeth-strout-war-peace-books-that-made-me\">Elizabeth Strout: \u2018My guilty pleasure? War and Peace. I read it furtively\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then one of the guests, another pregnant woman, goes into labour. Olive offers to drive her to hospital, but it is too late. \u201cOlive stared. She was amazed. <em>Pudendum</em> went through her mind \u2026 What a thing!\u201d From the commercialised silliness of a tacky modern rite to the contemplation of the body part Courbet called \u201cthe origin of the world\u201d \u2013 Strout\u2019s control of her narrative is so sure that she can manage the transition, deftly acknowledging its comedy, while allowing us as well to feel how moving is Olive\u2019s inarticulate wonder. What a thing indeed!</p> <p>These new stories confirm that in Olive Kitteridge, Strout has created one of those rare characters \u2013 think of Falstaff, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2018/sep/01/vanity-fair-becky-sharp\" title=\"\">Becky Sharp</a>, James Bond \u2013 so vivid and humorous that they seem to take on a life independent of the story framing them. Talking to one of the other inmates in the sheltered accommodation where we leave her, Olive is struck when the other woman admits to arrogance. \u201cOlive thought: By God, she\u2019s honest.\u201d Which means that they can be friends, because Olive, for all her wilful self-delusion, prizes truth above all things, and the author who created her is able to persuade us that, wrong as she often is, she is honest through and through.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Lucy Hughes-Hallett\u2019s latest book is Fabulous (4th Estate).

For anything.\u201d Everything that goes wrong is someone else\u2019s fault. Everyone else is stupid. \u201cStupid\u201d is one of Olive\u2019s favourite words. Another, expressive of her defensive dismissal of anything that makes her uneasy, is \u201cphooey\u201d. In the earlier book, a couple are at a concert when they see Olive come in with Henry. \u201cI don\u2019t know how he can stand her,\u201d says the man. \u201cHe loves her,\u201d says the woman. \u201cThat\u2019s how he can stand her.\u201d Readers love her too. Her story, the very opposite of the conventional coming-of-age narrative, is about the coming of age. At the end of Olive Kitteridge, published 11 years ago, we left her in her 70s, lying on a bed alongside a man, Jack, widowed like her, and as \u201cold, big and sagging\u201d as she was. \u201cOlive pictured two slices of Swiss cheese pressed together, such holes they brought to this union \u2013 what pieces life took out of you.\u201d As Olive, Again opens, only a month has passed. After a lot of predictable contrariness on Olive\u2019s part, she and Jack manage to get together. And then Olive is once again alone. These books are structured as collections of linked stories, but Strout\u2019s publisher calls them novels. It might be more accurate to say they are the prose-narrative equivalent of a long-running TV drama series. Characters (many of them familiar from earlier books) step into the foreground to star in their own stories, then recede, to be glimpsed much later, their lives having moved on in the meantime. However you choose to classify them, though, the Olive collections have the amplitude and emotional subtlety of the most generously comprehensive novels. Within the span of these taut, laconic little tales there is room for characters to show feeling from several levels of their being \u2013 only some of which they are aware of. They develop. They change their minds. Olive herself says, tentatively, in one of the stories from this latest batch, that she thinks she may have become a bit nicer, and it\u2019s true. She has. She grows old, as few fictional heroines do, while we witness the indignities, terrors and frustrations attendant on that process. Without labouring the point at all, for her authorial voice is always detached, never didactic, Strout shows how age has weakened what was most exasperating about Olive \u2013 her always-rightness, her irascibility \u2013 while leaving her bracing humour intact. In one story she attends a baby shower. A young pregnant woman sits in a garlanded chair while her female friends give her the paraphernalia she is going to need when the baby is born. There is a lot of cooing and exclaiming as the presents \u2013 feeding bottles, tiny garments \u2013 are passed around. Olive gets increasingly irritable: the thing that drives her mad is the way the mother-to-be puts aside the ribbons off each pretty parcel, taping them to a paper plate. Is it the parsimony she can\u2019t stand, or the time-wasting pernicketiness that prolongs the \u201cstupid\u201d ceremony, or the way the occasion forces her to contemplate her own failures as a mother? We aren\u2019t told. Strout, beady-eyed, observes and records every fluctuation in Olive\u2019s mood, but leaves us to interpret them. Then one of the guests, another pregnant woman, goes into labour. Olive offers to drive her to hospital, but it is too late. \u201cOlive stared. She was amazed. Pudendum went through her mind \u2026 What a thing!\u201d From the commercialised silliness of a tacky modern rite to the contemplation of the body part Courbet called \u201cthe origin of the world\u201d \u2013 Strout\u2019s control of her narrative is so sure that she can manage the transition, deftly acknowledging its comedy, while allowing us as well to feel how moving is Olive\u2019s inarticulate wonder. What a thing indeed! These new stories confirm that in Olive Kitteridge, Strout has created one of those rare characters \u2013 think of Falstaff, Becky Sharp, James Bond \u2013 so vivid and humorous that they seem to take on a life independent of the story framing them. Talking to one of the other inmates in the sheltered accommodation where we leave her, Olive is struck when the other woman admits to arrogance. \u201cOlive thought: By God, she\u2019s honest.\u201d Which means that they can be friends, because Olive, for all her wilful self-delusion, prizes truth above all things, and the author who created her is able to persuade us that, wrong as she often is, she is honest through and through. \u2022 Lucy Hughes-Hallett\u2019s latest book is Fabulous (4th Estate).

      "bodyText": "A whistleblower has accused the home affairs department of breaking freedom of information law to withhold documents about alleged legal breaches during pay negotiations with staff. Documents obtained by Guardian Australia show the department is currently investigating a whistleblower complaint alleging it breached FOI law by failing to respond to a request for internal records relating to a staff pay dispute for 130 days \u2013 100 days longer than typically allowed under FOI law. The revelation comes as the information watchdog, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC), announced a separate and broader investigation of systemic failings by the department to deal with FOI requests on time. Experts say delayed processing of FOI can render information useless or outdated by the time it is released, frustrating the purposes of the FOI act in promoting government transparency. The OAIC said the department failed to deal with 56% of FOI requests for non-personal information within the required time. The information commissioner\u2019s office investigation will be the first of its kind in about five years. \u201cThe OAIC has received a number of FOI complaints and review applications related to the department\u2019s compliance with statutory timeframes for processing requests for non-personal information,\u201d the information watchdog said in a statement. The investigation comes after a week of campaigning by media outlets on creeping government secrecy and eroding media freedoms. A key plank of that campaign \u2013 dubbed the right-to-know campaign \u2013 calls for reforms to improve the FOI system. In February, an anonymous public servant made an FOI request for internal records about possible unlawful conduct by the department during workplace negotiations with staff. Until that point, the department had spent about five years locked in a tense pay dispute with staff, which had caused significant animosity and led to strikes. The dispute ended up before the Fair Work Commission, which noted in January there were \u201clegitimate questions as to whether the department has complied\u201d with its legal requirements to act as a model litigant. The anonymous public servant requested a single document under FOI showing a formal notice made by the department of home affairs to the attorney-general\u2019s department alerting it to a possible breach of the model litigant requirements contained in the Legal Services Directions 2017. But the FOI request was ignored. The applicant received no response and, after 130 days, decided to lodge a whistleblower complaint to the department, alleging its FOI team was breaking the law. \u201cI contend that each and every Departmental officer responsible for failing to adhere to the requirements of the FOI Act in respect of my FOI application have engaged in disclosable conduct for the purposes of the Public Interest Disclosure Act 2013 because they have contravened the requirements of \u2026 the Public Service Act 1999,\u201d the whistleblower complaint read. In July, within two weeks of the complaint, the department released the document. It was redacted to the point of near uselessness. The whistleblower complaint is yet to be resolved. The department has sought an extension until 2020 to deal with the investigation. A spokesperson for the department said it \u201cseeks to process all freedom of information (FOI) requests within the statutory timeframes\u201d. The department receives by far the highest volume of FOI requests of any government department, and has improved its compliance rate from several years ago. Its compliance rate \u2013 the number of personal and non-personal FOI requests finalised within the legal timeframe \u2013 sits at 82.5% so far this year \u201cThe department is continuing to improve its compliance with the statutory timeframes contained in the FOI Act,\u201d the department said in a statement. \u201cFor the 2018-19 financial year, the department finalised 75% of requests within statutory timeframes.

      "body": "<p>The debate about healthcare has been at the center of the Democratic primaries, yet it is hard to make sense of the conversation. For some, public universal health insurance \u2013 such as Bernie Sanders\u2019s Medicare for All bill \u2013 would involve massive tax increases for the middle class. For others, it\u2019s the opposite: Medicare for All would cut costs for most Americans. Who is right?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2019/jun/13/2020-election-issues-democrats-policies-climate-change-abortion-immigration-healthcare-where-candidates-stand\">Where do the 2020 Democratic candidates stand on the key issues?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The starting point of any intelligent conversation about health in America must be that it\u2019s a cost for all of us \u2013 and a massive one. The United States spends close to 20% of its national income on health. Elderly Americans and low-income families are covered by public insurance programs (Medicare and Medicaid, respectively), funded by tax dollars (payroll taxes and general government revenue). The rest of the population must obtain coverage by a private company, which they typically get via their employers. Insurance, in that case, is funded by non-tax payments: health insurance premiums.</p> <p>Although they are not officially called taxes, insurance premiums paid by employers are just like taxes \u2013 but taxes paid to private insurers instead of paid to the government. Like payroll taxes, they reduce your wage. Like taxes, they are mandatory, or quasi-mandatory. Since the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, it has become compulsory to be insured, and employers with more than 50 full-time workers are required to enroll their workers in a health insurance plan.</p> <p>A frequent objection to calling health insurance premiums a tax is that people have some choice. Can\u2019t the poor, the argument goes, enroll in cheap health plans? If you start calling health insurance premiums a tax, then shouldn\u2019t we also call spending on food and clothes a tax?</p> <p>This argument, however, is wrong, because cheap healthcare does not exist. There are cheap meals, there are cheap clothes, but there is no cheap way to treat your heart attack, to cure your cancer, or to give birth. Cheap health insurance means no healthcare when you need it. All wealthy nations, even those that try hard to control costs, spend 10% of their national income on health \u2013 the equivalent of $7,500 a year per adult in the United States. The view that healthcare services are like haircuts or restaurant meals \u2013 services for which there is a product tailored to any budget \u2013 is a myth. Healthcare is like education: everybody needs it, regardless of their budget, but it\u2019s expensive. That\u2019s why all advanced economies, except the United States, fund it through taxation.</p> <p>The main difference between the insurance premiums currently paid by American workers and the taxes paid by workers in other countries is that taxes are based on ability to pay. The income tax has a rate that rises with income. Payroll taxes are proportional to income, at least up to a limit. Insurance premiums, by contrast, are not based on ability to pay. They are a fixed amount per covered worker and only depend on age and the number of family members covered. Insurance premiums are the most regressive possible type of tax: a poll tax. The secretary pays the same amount as the executive.</p> <p>Many people believe that the United States has a progressive tax system: you pay more, as a fraction of your income, as you earn more. In fact, if you allocate the total official tax take of the United States across the population, the US tax system looks like a giant flat tax that becomes regressive at the very top. And if you add mandatory private health insurance premiums to the official tax take, the US tax system turns out to be highly regressive. Once private health insurance is factored in, the average tax rate rises from a bit less than 30% at the bottom of the income distribution to reach close to 40% for the middle class, before collapsing to 23% for billionaires.</p> <p>The health insurance poll tax hammers the working class and the middle class. At the bottom of the distribution, it\u2019s not as onerous as sales and payroll taxes. But that\u2019s because many low-income Americans rely on a family member to cover them, enroll into Medicaid, or go uninsured. For the middle-class, the burden is enormous. Take a secretary earning $50,000 a year, who has employer-sponsored health insurance at a total cost of $15,000. In reality her labor compensation is $65,000 (that\u2019s what her employer pays in exchange of her work), but the secretary only gets $50,000. The executive earning $1,000,000 also pays the same $15,000 for his healthcare. This is a terrible funding mechanism.</p> <p>Funding healthcare via insurance premiums would be acceptable if this private poll tax was small. When the system of private health insurance developed initially, the cost of employer-sponsored health insurance was moderate, the equivalent of 0.5% of national income in the 1950s. Today, however, it is huge: 6% of national income, almost as much as payroll Social Security taxes. The Affordable Care Act increased the pool of Americans eligible for Medicaid and subsidized the purchase of private insurance for low-income people not covered by their employer. But it provided no relief for workers who fund their healthcare through a huge and growing poll tax.</p> <p>This situation is not sustainable. Most countries have understood this a long time ago. Health and retirement benefits started, like in the United States, as negotiated arrangements between employees (represented by their unions) and employers. But the task of funding health and retirement was then gradually entrusted to the government. Private premiums morphed into regular taxes, based on ability to pay. In the United States, this transformation has not happened yet for healthcare \u2013 leading to the crises we are in now.</p> <p>This is the context needed to understand the current debate at the heart of the presidential elections. Proposals such as Medicare for All would replace the current privatized poll tax by taxes based on ability to pay. Some believe that it would result in a big tax increase for America\u2019s middle class. But the data show that it would, in fact, lead to large income gains for the vast majority of workers.</p> <p>Take again the case of a secretary earning $50,000 in wage and currently contributing $15,000 through her employer to an insurance company. With universal health insurance, her wage would rise to $65,000 \u2013 her full labor compensation. With an income tax of 6% \u2013 which, if applied to a base large enough, would be enough to fund universal health insurance \u2013 she would have to pay about $4,000 more in tax. But the net gain would be enormous: $11,000. Instead of taking home $50,000, the secretary would take home $61,000.</p> <p>On TaxJusticeNow.org, any interested reader can simulate the effect of replacing private health insurance premiums by taxes \u2013 progressive income taxes, wealth taxes, consumption taxes, or broad taxes on consumption or all of national income. This simulator that we developed is open-source, user-friendly, and based on a systematic exploitation of all available statistics about who earns what and pays what in taxes and health insurance in America.</p> <p>As one illustration, it\u2019s possible to see how the tax plans of the leading Democratic primary candidates would affect tax rates for each group of the population. For instance, Bernie Sanders\u2019s tax proposals would be enough to replace all existing private insurance premiums, while leaving 2.6% of national income to cover the uninsured and spend on other programs. Under such a plan, the 9 bottom deciles of the income distribution would gain income on average, as would the bottom of the top 10%. With smart new taxes\u2014such as broad income taxes exempting low wages and retirees\u2014it is possible to make the vast majority of the population win from a transition to universal health insurance.</p> <p>Supporters of Medicare for All are right. Funding universal health insurance through taxes would lead to a large tax <em>cut</em> for the vast majority of workers. It would abolish the huge poll tax they currently shoulder, and the data show that for most workers, it would lead to the biggest take-home pay raise in a generation.</p> <ul> <li><p>Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman are economics professors at the University of California, Berkeley, and the authors of <a href=\"https://wwnorton.com/books/9781324002727\">The Triumph of Injustice:</a> How the Rich Dodge Taxes and How to Make Them Pay, from which this essay is adapted</p></li> </ul>",

There are brightly coloured long dresses adorned with intricate beadwork and a very specific embroidery design with sharp edges, like a dagger.</p> <p>Despite the immense diversity, colour and variety, Afghan fashion is not well known internationally. \u201cThe image you see from far is one with women in burqas and chader [a long black outer garment]. But go to an Afghan wedding and that image will be broken,\u201d Rahimi says.</p> <p>However, she has noticed a significant shift in how Afghan fashion is perceived since she first started the company. \u201cI do get a lot of surprised reactions to my designs when I am abroad, but that is changing.

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s a steady stream of customers coming through the doors of Rahiba Rahimi\u2019s fashion studio. The 25-year-old\u2019s bold, intricate designs are fitted on mannequins and hung on rails around her showroom in Kabul. Rahimi is the lead designer and co-proprietor of Laman, a clothing label she helped build in the Afghan capital five years ago. Her customers are mostly Afghan women and men, together with a few foreign nationals who work in Kabul\u2019s aid-driven economy. \u201cA lot of times we collaborate and co-design with customers because Afghans are very good at fashion. Even now, if you see on the street, you will see how Afghans express their creativity in colours and styles. We are here to help with the quality of that expression, with design, details, fabric,\u201d she says, walking around the multistorey building that doubles as a workshop and studio. \u201cI haven\u2019t studied fashion designing, this came about based on my love for colours and patterns and, in a broader sense, my love for the culture and heritage.\u201d Her designs are a world away from what might be considered, outside the wartorn country at least, the norms of Afghan fashion. Clothing styles in the country have traditionally been influenced by social norms formed over decades of conflict, violence and extremism. Yet that hasn\u2019t deterred a younger generation of Afghans from pushing the boundaries, while also attempting to revive traditional handicraft and art. \u201cFashion for me represents a strong statement in a conservative society. It is an expression of myself as a woman and as an Afghan youth. I should have the right to wear the colours I want to wear. It is a sign of freedom,\u201d Rahimi explains. Rahimi talks about the new Laman designs, many of which featured in a fashion show in Milan in June. The clothes aren\u2019t entirely traditional, but a fusion of modern styles using lighter fabric. \u201cWe are making Afghan fashion global while also keeping certain things and values the same,\u201d she says, picking up shirts with vintage Baluchi-Nuristani hand embroidery and coats edged with embroidered leather. There are brightly coloured long dresses adorned with intricate beadwork and a very specific embroidery design with sharp edges, like a dagger. Despite the immense diversity, colour and variety, Afghan fashion is not well known internationally. \u201cThe image you see from far is one with women in burqas and chader [a long black outer garment]. But go to an Afghan wedding and that image will be broken,\u201d Rahimi says. However, she has noticed a significant shift in how Afghan fashion is perceived since she first started the company. \u201cI do get a lot of surprised reactions to my designs when I am abroad, but that is changing. Even in international fashion, there is so much diversity \u2013 and Afghanistan\u2019s fashion is finding its place,\u201d says Rahimi, who employees two dozen Afghans, including female designers, tailors and sales staff. Rahimi, who is also completing her undergraduate degree in business management, admits that despite their growth, profit margins remain low. \u201cFinances are not always [a] lot, but we have so far managed to break even. It is still a small to medium business, with investment from my family, particularly my father, who believes in me,\u201d she says, adding that her female employees are central to her drive to keep going. \u201cIt is not just about the fashion, but also about creating jobs and empowering other women. They have grown so much with the brand; some of them are breadwinners for their families,\u201d she says. Hasina Aimaq, 26, another designer breaking taboos and stereotypes, also showcased her work at the Milan show, held in the historical Salone Dei Tessuti. Aimaq\u2019s bold designs attracted both acclaim and criticism. Her signature piece, a hand-embroidered blue dress inspired by the traditional blue burqa worn by women in Afghanistan, was much discussed in the country, and stirred the ire of many conservative Afghans. Sitting in her small studio in the basement of a house in the west of Kabul, a much more basic operation than Rahimi\u2019s showroom, she shares the motivation behind her most controversial, yet also most commissioned design from the Milan set. \u201cMy aim was to share a positive image of Afghanistan and specifically showcase the talents of Afghan women through these designs,\u201d she says, sitting next to a large working table where samples from the Milan fashion show are laid out. \u201cEveryone recognises the blue burqa as Afghan clothing, so I thought: \u2018Let\u2019s make something else out of this and show them what Afghan women are capable of.\u2019\u201d Dismissing the critics, Aimaq says she was encouraged the support she got, especially from women in the rural north: \u201cI also received some positive comments, because many Afghan women acknowledge that the chader is not really part of our culture.

As the prime minister edged towards agreeing a new deal with Brussels, the currency rallied strongly on the foreign exchanges, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/11/pound-surges-as-hopes-of-brexit-deal-rise\">posting its strongest two-day performance since just before the EU referendum three years ago</a>. Sterling in the past month has jumped in value by about 5\u00a2 against the US dollar and 3\u00a2 on the euro, rising to about $1.30 and \u20ac1.16. The pound is still worth substantially less than on the eve of the Brexit vote three years ago, while economists warn the currency could stage a dramatic sell-off should the progress on Brexit unravel.</p> \n<h2>Breakthrough lifts UK company shares</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"ftse100\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-eg=&quot;ftse100&quot;></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"ftse250\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-eg=&quot;ftse250&quot;></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Shares in UK-focused companies have rallied strongly in the past month, amid hopes that a disorderly Brexit can be avoided. Typically a surging pound would trigger a sell-off in the FTSE 100 as the firms in the blue-chip index make a significant proportion of their profits in overseas currencies. However, the FTSE 100 has fallen by a relatively modest 100 points in the past month. The more domestically focused FTSE 250, with more companies operating solely in Britain than the FTSE 100, has rallied by almost 300 points over the past month. The changes come in a relatively flat month for stock markets around the world, against a backdrop of heightened concerns over the health of the global economy.</p> \n<h2>Better than forecast</h2> \n<h2>Inflation unexpectedly holds steady</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"cpi\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-eg=&quot;cpi&quot;></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>UK inflation unexpectedly held steady in September, easing some of the pressure on hard-pressed households in the run-up to Brexit. In a development that may also discourage the Bank of England from raising interest rates any time soon, the <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/september2019\">Office for National Statistics</a> (ONS) said that the consumer price index remained unchanged at 1.7% last month. September\u2019s inflation reading is used by the government to raise the value of pensions, benefits and business rates every spring. However, after imposing a benefit freeze for the past four years, the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/oct/16/benefits-to-rise-17-with-inflation-in-first-increase-in-five-years\">refused to confirm whether it would now allow benefits to increase </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/oct/16/benefits-to-rise-17-with-inflation-in-first-increase-in-five-years\">in line with inflation</a> \u2013 a sign that pressure on lower-income households could continue.</p> \n<h2>Worse than forecast</h2> \n<h2>Exports slowdown bolsters trade deficit</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"trade\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-eg=&quot;trade&quot;></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Britain\u2019s trade deficit with the rest of the world narrowed slightly to \u00a31.5bn in August, missing the expectations of City economists for a greater improvement to \u00a31.1bn. The gap between imports and exports has gradually fallen in recent months as companies across the country pause their stockpiling efforts. Earlier this year, businesses rushed to stockpile goods to protect against a no-deal Brexit, leading the trade deficit to hit the highest levels on record. As companies have stored up adequate supplies, import volumes from the EU are 12% below average for the first quarter, while exports are 10% down.</p> \n<h2>Worse than forecast</h2> \n<h2>Private sector slides towards recession</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"pmi\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-eg=&quot;pmi&quot;></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Britain edged closer to its first recession since the financial crisis after the country\u2019s dominant service sector unexpectedly plunged into contraction in September, in a sign of the mounting stress facing the economy because of Brexit. All three big sectors of the economy \u2013 services, manufacturing and construction \u2013 dropped into contraction, according to surveys of business activity by IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (Cips). The purchasing managers index (PMI) for all three sectors sank to 49.5 in September, from 50.6 a month earlier, on a scale where anything above 50.0 indicates economic growth. The PMI readings have been more downbeat than official growth estimates in recent months. According to the ONS, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/10/uk-looks-likely-to-avoid-recession-despite-brexit-chaos\">the economy grew by 0.3% in the three months to August</a>, a stronger rate than expected. The ONS said GDP would need to plunge by at least 1.5% on the month in September for the economy to fall into recession in the third quarter. Declines of that magnitude are considered rare and extreme.</p> \n<h2>Worse than forecast</h2> \n<h2>Employment falls by largest margin in four years</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"unemployment\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-eg=&quot;unemployment&quot;></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"wages\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-eg=&quot;wages&quot;></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Brexit uncertainty appears to have dented Britain\u2019s previously robust labour market as the number of people in work <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/15/uks-robust-jobs-market-dented-amid-big-fall-in-employment\">fell by the largest margin in four years in August</a>. In signs of stress for the jobs market, employment fell by 56,000 in the three months to the end of August from the previous quarter amid job losses at high street retailers and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/15/one-third-of-car-firms-have-cut-jobs-amid-brexit-uncertainty\">redundancies across much of the manufacturing sector</a>. Unemployment rose to 3.9% from 3.8% on the back of mounting concerns that the jobless total is about to begin a sustained rise. A recent increase in workers\u2019 pay growth also came to an end in August, as average weekly earnings dropped,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/10/uk-jobs-creation-pay-growth-economy-brexit\"> from 4% to 3.8%</a>.</p> \n<h2>Meets forecast</h2> \n<h2>Retail sales fail to bounce back</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"retail\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-eg=&quot;retail&quot;></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>British consumers appear to be putting off spending on big-ticket items as uncertainty over Brexit deters them from raising their spending. Official figures showed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/17/uk-shoppers-shun-big-ticket-items-as-brexit-uncertainty-bites\">retail sales volumes were flat on the month in September</a>, in line with the forecasts of City economists. However, the value of sales was down by 0.2% and annual sales growth accelerated to 3.1%, below estimates, after a weak annual growth rate of 2.6% seen in August. Drivers also cut back on buying fuel while online shoppers reined in their spending, possibly keeping their powder dry for the Black Friday online shopping event at the end of November.</p> \n<h2>Better than forecast</h2> \n<h2>Public borrowing rises ahead of Javid\u2019s first budget</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"borrowing\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-eg=&quot;borrowing&quot;></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/22/borrowing-increase-chancellor-javid-budget-brexit-spending\">Sajid Javid</a> is preparing for his first budget as chancellor with public borrowing on the rise. In the run-up to the 6 November budget, official figures showed that a spending upturn across government departments lifted the budget deficit \u2013 the shortfall between state spending and income from taxes \u2013 in September. Borrowing was \u00a39.4bn, about \u00a3600m higher than in September a year ago, although it was slightly below the expectations of City economists. The rise in the deficit comes as Johnson\u2019s government pledges to increase spending on health, schools and policing before an election.

      "bodyText": "Pound surges on Brexit progress The pound has surged to the highest levels in five months amid mounting hopes that Britain can leave the EU without Boris Johnson resorting to a disruptive no-deal Brexit. As the prime minister edged towards agreeing a new deal with Brussels, the currency rallied strongly on the foreign exchanges, posting its strongest two-day performance since just before the EU referendum three years ago. Sterling in the past month has jumped in value by about 5\u00a2 against the US dollar and 3\u00a2 on the euro, rising to about $1.30 and \u20ac1.16. The pound is still worth substantially less than on the eve of the Brexit vote three years ago, while economists warn the currency could stage a dramatic sell-off should the progress on Brexit unravel. Breakthrough lifts UK company shares Shares in UK-focused companies have rallied strongly in the past month, amid hopes that a disorderly Brexit can be avoided. Typically a surging pound would trigger a sell-off in the FTSE 100 as the firms in the blue-chip index make a significant proportion of their profits in overseas currencies. However, the FTSE 100 has fallen by a relatively modest 100 points in the past month. The more domestically focused FTSE 250, with more companies operating solely in Britain than the FTSE 100, has rallied by almost 300 points over the past month. The changes come in a relatively flat month for stock markets around the world, against a backdrop of heightened concerns over the health of the global economy. Better than forecast Inflation unexpectedly holds steady UK inflation unexpectedly held steady in September, easing some of the pressure on hard-pressed households in the run-up to Brexit. In a development that may also discourage the Bank of England from raising interest rates any time soon, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that the consumer price index remained unchanged at 1.7% last month. September\u2019s inflation reading is used by the government to raise the value of pensions, benefits and business rates every spring. However, after imposing a benefit freeze for the past four years, the government refused to confirm whether it would now allow benefits to increase in line with inflation \u2013 a sign that pressure on lower-income households could continue. Worse than forecast Exports slowdown bolsters trade deficit Britain\u2019s trade deficit with the rest of the world narrowed slightly to \u00a31.5bn in August, missing the expectations of City economists for a greater improvement to \u00a31.1bn. The gap between imports and exports has gradually fallen in recent months as companies across the country pause their stockpiling efforts. Earlier this year, businesses rushed to stockpile goods to protect against a no-deal Brexit, leading the trade deficit to hit the highest levels on record. As companies have stored up adequate supplies, import volumes from the EU are 12% below average for the first quarter, while exports are 10% down. Worse than forecast Private sector slides towards recession Britain edged closer to its first recession since the financial crisis after the country\u2019s dominant service sector unexpectedly plunged into contraction in September, in a sign of the mounting stress facing the economy because of Brexit. All three big sectors of the economy \u2013 services, manufacturing and construction \u2013 dropped into contraction, according to surveys of business activity by IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (Cips). The purchasing managers index (PMI) for all three sectors sank to 49.5 in September, from 50.6 a month earlier, on a scale where anything above 50.0 indicates economic growth. The PMI readings have been more downbeat than official growth estimates in recent months. According to the ONS, the economy grew by 0.3% in the three months to August, a stronger rate than expected. The ONS said GDP would need to plunge by at least 1.5% on the month in September for the economy to fall into recession in the third quarter. Declines of that magnitude are considered rare and extreme. Worse than forecast Employment falls by largest margin in four years Brexit uncertainty appears to have dented Britain\u2019s previously robust labour market as the number of people in work fell by the largest margin in four years in August. In signs of stress for the jobs market, employment fell by 56,000 in the three months to the end of August from the previous quarter amid job losses at high street retailers and redundancies across much of the manufacturing sector. Unemployment rose to 3.9% from 3.8% on the back of mounting concerns that the jobless total is about to begin a sustained rise. A recent increase in workers\u2019 pay growth also came to an end in August, as average weekly earnings dropped, from 4% to 3.8%. Meets forecast Retail sales fail to bounce back British consumers appear to be putting off spending on big-ticket items as uncertainty over Brexit deters them from raising their spending. Official figures showed that retail sales volumes were flat on the month in September, in line with the forecasts of City economists. However, the value of sales was down by 0.2% and annual sales growth accelerated to 3.1%, below estimates, after a weak annual growth rate of 2.6% seen in August. Drivers also cut back on buying fuel while online shoppers reined in their spending, possibly keeping their powder dry for the Black Friday online shopping event at the end of November. Better than forecast Public borrowing rises ahead of Javid\u2019s first budget Sajid Javid is preparing for his first budget as chancellor with public borrowing on the rise. In the run-up to the 6 November budget, official figures showed that a spending upturn across government departments lifted the budget deficit \u2013 the shortfall between state spending and income from taxes \u2013 in September. Borrowing was \u00a39.4bn, about \u00a3600m higher than in September a year ago, although it was slightly below the expectations of City economists. The rise in the deficit comes as Johnson\u2019s government pledges to increase spending on health, schools and policing before an election. The Institute for Fiscal Studies, a tax and spending thinktank, warned this month that Johnson could lift the public debt \u2013 the sum of all budget deficits recorded throughout history \u2013 to levels unseen since the mid-1960s as Brexit and government spending plans dent the public finances. Better than forecast House price growth gradually recovers House prices across the UK still appear to be rising, although only just, despite Brexit uncertainty sapping the confidence of buyers and sellers. A gauge of house prices from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors \u2013 which shows the difference between members reporting price rises and falls \u2013 improved to -2 in September from -4 a month earlier, above the forecasts of City economists. Figures from the Land Registry and ONS showed the year-on-year growth in house prices rose to 1.3 % in August from 0.8% in July but remained below the increases seen this time last year. And another thing we\u2019ve learned this month \u2026 Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal set to lose Britain \u00a3130bn in GDP growth The Brexit deal negotiated by Johnson is expected to sacrifice as much as 6.7% of lost GDP growth over the next 15 years, or as much as \u00a3130bn that the UK economy would grow by if Britain stayed in the EU. Although the prime minister has refused to publish a detailed impact assessment, economists said estimates drawn up a year ago by the government contained a scenario similar to his deal, which envisions striking a limited free-trade deal with the EU.

In a sign of the mounting stress on the UK, the number of people in work dropped by the largest margin in four years in August as companies put their hiring plans on hold, with firms losing contracts and facing delays because of the uncertainty over Britain\u2019s future. , some bright patches remain, including official figures suggesting that a summer recession has been avoided. As parliament attempts to scrutinise Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan, the government has come under heavy fire for refusing to publish a detailed economic impact assessment of its proposals. Writing in the Guardian, David Blanchflower, a former member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC), said it was \u201cdisgraceful\u201d that the government had so far refused to publish any details. \u201cThis is either utter incompetence or they are trying to hide bad news, or both. Brexit of whatever form is going to lower living standards compared to remaining in the EU,\u201d he said. Analysis released last year as Theresa May attempted to win support for her Brexit deal indicated that a plan similar to Johnson\u2019s would sacrifice as much as \u00a3130bn in lost GDP growth over the next 15 years. Sajid Javid has rebuffed the criticisms, saying it is \u201cself-evidently in our economic interest\u201d to ratify Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan. Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, has said a Brexit deal would benefit the economy by removing the cloud of uncertainty hanging over British businesses. But with key details for the country\u2019s future relationship with the EU yet to be confirmed, MPs warn that more time is required to avoid lasting economic damage. To gauge the impact of Brexit on a monthly basis, the Guardian monitors eight economic indicators, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE 100. City economists made forecasts for seven of those barometers before their release and in three cases the outcome was worse than expected. Three beat the forecasts, one met the forecast. Amid signs of a breakthrough in the Brexit talks emerging over the past month, the pound has surged to the highest level since May on rising hopes in the City of London that a disruptive no-deal Brexit can be avoided, while shares in UK-focused companies have rallied. However, the latest snapshot suggests the lingering threat of a no-deal Brexit and the failure to make faster progress has damaged the outlook for jobs and growth during recent months. Surveys of business activity monitored by the Treasury and the Bank of England for early economic warning signs indicated that private sector activity slid into contraction in September, as British firms put their spending plans on hold amid the uncertainty. According to IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (Cips), activity in the country\u2019s dominant services sector \u2013 which makes up about 80% of the economy, encompassing industries from banking to restaurants \u2013 fell into negative territory as companies reported job cuts, falling sales and cancelled and postponed projects. The latest official figures from the labour market revealed a 56,000 drop in employment in the three months to the end of August from the previous quarter \u2013 the biggest fall in four years \u2013 as high street retailers and manufacturing firms cut jobs across the country. Despite the mounting gloom, official figures suggested that a recession between April and September was likely avoided. Gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 0.3% in the three months to the end of August, boosted by rising service sector activity. According to the ONS, the economy would need to shrink in September by more than 1.5% to confirm a recession \u2013 a level it said would mark an extreme and rare decline. Against a backdrop of slower global growth amid the US-China trade war and as lingering Brexit uncertainty drags down export activity in the UK, analysts warn the British economy remains vulnerable to shocks. Writing in the Guardian, Andrew Sentance, a former member of the MPC, warned that economic growth was becoming increasingly unbalanced, as Brexit uncertainty harms the manufacturing sector. \u201cThe UK economy is likely to continue to grow at a modest pace, driven by consumer spending and the services sector.

A significant increase in the numbers of invasive species across the globe is attributed to a threefold increase in travel and a rise in air and sea transport of goods. The species arrive in the UK in a variety of ways, including by attaching themselves to the hulls of ships or \u201chitchhiking\u201d within ballast water, as contaminants of ornamental plants, or on fishing equipment.",

To protect the quality of the blood product, David Owen, as health secretary in 1975, took blood plasma collection into public ownership as Plasma Resources UK.

A series like this could be a sustained exercise in creeping tension, but there are moments in Killer Camp where you could be watching any generic reality show, and that\u2019s a shame.

Wouldn\u2019t you watch a gameshow based on It Follows, where contestants are patiently hunted down by a slow-moving zombie? Wouldn\u2019t you watch a gameshow set in the nightmarishly picturesque world of Midsommar? It might exceed an ITV2 budget, but a gameshow based on Us \u2013 where unsuspecting contestants are bedevilled by their own evil doppelgangers \u2013 has the potential to be the best gameshow ever made. Killer Camp is very good indeed, but next Halloween I want to be terrified.</p> <ul> <li><p>Killer Camp is on ITV2, 9pm, Sunday to Thursday</p></li> </ul>",

To tell you how exactly would strip Killer Camp of all its fun, but the murder sequences themselves are all completely gorgeous to look at; the tinny reality TV production values of the rest of the show ramped up to grimy video nasty levels. Some of them are a little silly \u2013 you\u2019ll never look at a nude statue in the same way again \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t detract from how purely entertaining they are. To my mind Release the Hounds still tops Killer Camp, with the moments of horror here a little sparser than I would have liked. A series like this could be a sustained exercise in creeping tension, but there are moments in Killer Camp where you could be watching any generic reality show, and that\u2019s a shame. But these moments are worth enduring because, when it fires on all cylinders, it is terrific television. Better yet, now we\u2019re in the clutches of a horror boom, there\u2019s plenty of potential to make these horror gameshows and tried and true genre. Wouldn\u2019t you watch a gameshow based on It Follows, where contestants are patiently hunted down by a slow-moving zombie? Wouldn\u2019t you watch a gameshow set in the nightmarishly picturesque world of Midsommar? It might exceed an ITV2 budget, but a gameshow based on Us \u2013 where unsuspecting contestants are bedevilled by their own evil doppelgangers \u2013 has the potential to be the best gameshow ever made. Killer Camp is very good indeed, but next Halloween I want to be terrified. Killer Camp is on ITV2, 9pm, Sunday to Thursday",

      "bodyText": "Nearly one in four Qantas shareholders have voted in favour of a human rights resolution around ending involuntary transportation of immigration detainees, quadrupling last year\u2019s support. The resolution, submitted by the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR) on behalf of 100 shareholders, failed with 23.56% of the vote, but far exceeded the 6.4% a similar resolution garnered in 2018. Qantas, which held its annual general meeting on Friday, is among a number of airlines worldwide under pressure to cease cooperation with government transportations of immigration detainees. The department of home affairs has been repeatedly criticised over its policy of transferring detainees between facilities, often without warning, and away from family, support networks, and medical care. Friday\u2019s resolution called on Qantas to review its policies and processes around involuntary transportation and to disclose the result \u2013 and any identified human rights risks that pose a commercial threat \u2013 to shareholders. A separate resolution, on which the review resolution was dependent, called for constitutional change and received a vote of 3.4%, less than in 2018. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon The ACCR\u2019s director of human rights, Dhakshayini Sooriyakumaran, said even though it failed, the vote for the resolution was the largest vote against a board on a human rights issue in Australian corporate history. \u201cScrutiny by shareholders of Qantas\u2019s role in Australia\u2019s refugee policy is part of a global realignment of companies and investors that are funding immigration and prison infrastructure,\u201d she said. The ACCR believed the support of a proxy firm was behind the huge swing, and was likely influenced by the decision to remove a clause from 2018\u2019s resolution that called for the company to cease involuntary transportations while the review was conducted. Sooriyakumaran said the ACCR had met with Qantas repeatedly over the past 18 months, and the company had recently urged the centre to withdraw its resolution after making some changes to its due diligence policies. Qantas\u2019s chairman, Richard Goyder, said the vote was another \u201cemphatic rejection\u201d of ACCR resolutions related to asylum seekers by the company\u2019s shareholders. \u201cI\u2019d encourage ACCR to take up their cause with the federal government, which is the actual target of their campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cI would also like to reiterate that the directors acknowledge the complexity of Australia\u2019s immigration policy and the societal community interest in its broader implications. \u201cIt remains our firm position that the government and courts are best placed to make decisions on the legal immigration status of individuals seeking to remain in Australia \u2013 not airlines.\u201d Last week Guardian Australia revealed the Australian Border Force had transported a seriously ill young man to Perth on a Qantas flight, away from arrangements to have him treated in Melbourne, and took almost a month to bring him back. \u201cThe nature in which this transfer was undertaken is proof that Qantas may be complicit in human rights abuses of those seeking asylum in Australia,\u201d said Jacob Thomas, human rights advocate from the Queen\u2019s young leader program, who attended the AGM. \u201cWe will not stop until Qantas ends its part in the deportation of those who have sought asylum and refuge. This is not what the spirit of Australia is about.\u201d The AGM also heard from the chief executive, Alan Joyce, who said the carrier was well placed despite falls in business and consumer confidence. \u201cThere was a temporary spike in fuel prices. Trade wars are impacting freight demand,\u201d Joyce said. \u201cWe are feeling the effects of all of that, as you\u2019d expect.\u201d Qantas on Thursday outlined a series of expected financial hits related to the factors cited at the AGM. Deteriorating global trade conditions have reduced freight demand and will cut full-year profit by between $25m and $30m, while currency movements are set to add $25m to non-fuel costs in the first half. Profit for the six months to 31 December will also take a $25m hit from pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, with Qantas aiming to minimise any second-half impact with capacity reduction. Nonetheless, Joyce said Qantas, which has reported more than $4.3bn in profits over the past five financial years, remained optimistic. \u201cOur fundamentals are sound,\u201d he said. Shareholders voted in favour of the three directors standing for re-election, including Todd Sampson, who committed to increasing his shareholding after reports of disquiet among some investors that the marketing expert and TV personality did not have sufficient personal exposure.",

The hotel, set across six Georgian townhouses, is covered in scaffolding (the hotel is still in a soft-opening phase) but once I\u2019m through the door, Inhabit\u2019s Scandi-inspired interior dotted with plants exudes calmness.</p> <p>The first thing I notice is the wellness programme at the front desk (of which more later); the reception, dominated by a woollen wall hanging, leads into the library, painted grey and blue, and furnished with Danish chairs, and bespoke pieces by <a href=\"http://www.goldfingerfactory.com/about\" title=\"\">Goldfinger Factory</a>, a local social enterprise. Cushions are by Hertfordshire-based <a href=\"https://www.aerende.co.uk/\">Aerende</a>, which sells homewares made by vulnerable people in the UK. The hotel is clearly paying more than lip service in its commitment to wellbeing, thinking about its responsibilities beyond its guests: during the renovation, a link-up with <a href=\"https://www.globechain.com/\">Globechain</a> helped reduce the amount of waste sent to landfill; in keeping with its aim to be single-use plastic free there\u2019s bottled water on tap on each floor and re-useable glass coffee cups for sale in reception.</p> <p>Daily wellness sessions include morning meditation (free), yoga (\u00a310 a class) and guided walks (\u00a310) into nearby Hyde Park. This week, meditation pods with headphones are being installed providing a space for guests to have a 10-minute guided session. I\u2019m booked in for a Yin yoga class, which involves lying down for a series of very gentle stretches \u2013 or \u201cconstructive rest\u201d as the teacher puts it. It does the trick: the muscle tightness after a day sat in front of a computer screen disappears. A session in the infrared sauna (free) compounds my sense of relaxation.

Tumeric appears in several of the \u00e0 la carte breakfast dishes, too (such as eggs royale, which comes with a dairy-free hollandaise, smoked salmon optional, \u00a39).</p> <p>Smashed avo is a given, of course, but there are more exotic dishes too that take almost as long to say as to eat: orange blossom tigernut-flour muffin-top pancakes with coconut yoghurt and berry compote, for one. The drinks are even more intriguing: a \u201cmedicinal mushroom latte\u201d made with mushrooms and maple syrup. I have a moment picturing Patsy from Ab Fab ordering a smoothie the morning after the night before, and I admit, I ordered a plain old coffee with normal milk, but as more of us give up meat or take a flexitarian approach, it\u2019s refreshing to see a hotel offering something other than croissants and fry-ups. </p> <p>If you\u2019re on the hotel\u2019s room-only rate, and don\u2019t want to pay to eat breakfast in (\u00a315 for the buffet or dishes from \u00a36 on the a la carte menu), there are plenty of nearby options: giant sticky pastries at <a href=\"https://www.bonnebouche.co.uk/our-shops-and-cafes\" title=\"\">Bonne Bouche</a> on Praed Street, and an array of artisan coffee shops around Paddington Basin and Little Venice, including the <a href=\"https://www.departmentofcoffee.com/our-cafes/2018/9/6/paddington\" title=\"\">Department </a><a href=\"https://www.departmentofcoffee.com/our-cafes/2018/9/6/paddington\" title=\"\">of Coffee and Social Affairs</a> and <a href=\"https://www.daisygreenfood.com/venues/little-venice\" title=\"\">Beany Green</a>.

Ground-floor spaces now flow into one linked bar and dining area, where low lighting gleams off polished wood and the patina of vintage-style leather sofas. Nautical knick-knacks, including splendid model ships, are a nod to the eponymous monarch, called the Sailor King.</p> <p>Three venerable Harrow Road pubs closed recently for redevelopment as flats, so the determination of the William IV\u2019s new owners late last year to recreate a pub from what had become a shisha bar, DJ venue and grotty bedsits is to be applauded. The 15 spacious en suite rooms are plain and simple, with feature fireplaces and pale walls. They have carpets so thick you could almost sleep on them rather than in the comfy beds. White tile-and-marble bathrooms are also minimalist. Ask for a room at the back if you\u2019re a light sleeper: the Harrow Road traffic is noisy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b9d83d316892bb2daf7e5b824e34e1fa69e36ee5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9d83d316892bb2daf7e5b824e34e1fa69e36ee5/0_482_7688_4613/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Double bedroom at The William IV, Kensal Green, NW10\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>What about breakfast and dinner?</strong><br>The walk along Harrow Road from Kensal Green station (Bakerloo line and Overground) yields not a single cafe, pub or restaurant, so the imaginative gastropub-style menu is particularly welcome.

Once the Archers Tavern, it has been renamed after Thomas Buxton, campaigner against slavery and capital punishment, co-founder of the RSPCA and all-round good egg, who lived up the street. The bedrooms are bijou, with a clean, functional feel: bare brick painted brilliant white, wiring hidden in aluminium tubes, TV, coffee and tea things on a small chest of drawers. The washbasin is in the room, making the shower and loo less of a squash \u2013 the obscured-glass sliding door on the loo/shower affords, well, only minimal privacy, however.

From four starters we choose a chilled pea soup (made extra special with perfectly roasted hazelnuts), and scallops with garlic butter and samphire. Equally seasonal is a plate of fresh tagliatelle with courgettes, ricotta and shaved raw asparagus. Husband\u2019s fish of the day (\u00a315) is a good-looking chunk of cod in a deeply sweet-savoury shellfish jus, but I do find the lack of any vegan main surprising given this is east London in 2019.</p> <p>Breakfast is equally imaginative \u2013 though with nothing for vegetarians or vegans: ham and eggs with ethereally light and crispy r\u00f6sti for him, while I make a veggie option by declining the merguez sausage with my tasty harissa-baked eggs.

      "bodyText": "Mama Shelter London, Bethnal Green, E2 What\u2019s it like? \u201cMama loves you,\u201d my plate reads. The seemingly standard blue-and-white patterned china dish, on closer inspection, includes this tiny message. Behind me is a lamp with rabbit feet and ears and, by the reception, beaded Darth Vader helmets top birdcage-style cabinets. Across the restaurant\u2019s black ceiling, graffiti by graphic designer and artist Beniloys is a mix of bright patterns and ancient city rules: \u201cA Freeman of the City of London may drive a flock of sheep over Tower Bridge.\u201d In the basement, not a gym, but two karaoke rooms with 50s-style microphones. It\u2019s these design touches that make Mama Shelter different from other city hotels of the same size. The brand was created by Club Med co-founders the Trigano family and designer Philippe Starck in 2008, and there are now 12 globally. The group\u2019s first UK hotel is a prominent, matt-black building with black-and-white striped awnings on a corner of Hackney Road, near Bethnal Green. The ground floor is a living space that doubles as the restaurant, with comfy sofas, Aztec prints, ceiling-mounted fireplaces and vintage lampshades. It\u2019s a cabinet of curiosities with a buzzy, already popular restaurant and internal courtyard cocktail bar with a retractable roof. There are 194 en suite rooms, across four floors. Mine, a medium double on the second floor, is compact, modern and unfussy. What about breakfast and dinner? Food is made for sharing at Mama Shelter, with a variety of smaller plates and platters, some influenced by the local area. My favourites include pork belly baos with char siu sauce, pak choi and ginger (\u00a36); tuna crudo with pickled kohlrabi, ponzu and calamansi dressing (\u00a312); and a truffle ricotta pizzette (\u00a39). Larger plates on the menu range from French classics and vegan dishes, to posh kebabs and a pie, mash and liquor platter (\u00a326). There\u2019s a lot of choice at the buffet breakfast (7am-10.30am; a la carte breakfast 10.30am-12.30pm): big trays of smoked salmon, pastries, muffins, cereals, yoghurt, a juice-it-yourself stand, and all the usual cooked suspects along with a vegan bean mix in tomato sauce and flavoured rice. It\u2019s not included in the room rate, however \u2013 it costs \u00a315pp \u2013 and there are a multitude of cafes to explore along Hackney Road and Cambridge Heath Road. What\u2019s on the doorstep? Cambridge Heath Overground (two stops from Liverpool Street) is a few minutes\u2019 walk, or get to Bethnal Green, on the Central line, in 10. E Pellicci (open since 1900) is the classic choice for a fry-up and two famous 24-hour bagel shops are on Brick Lane. Take a wander around east London favourites such as Columbia Road Flower Market, Broadway Market, and Hackney City Farm. The V&amp;A\u2019s Museum of Childhood is also just a few minutes\u2019 walk away, or head to indie gallery land Vyner Street. There are plenty of places to drink, ranging from traditional boozers to taprooms and speakeasies. Notables include the award-winning Marksman pub or Sager + Wilde under the railway arches. For late-night beats, head to Oval Space and the Pickle Factory, or Metropolis for LGBTQ parties. How much? Doubles from \u00a399 room-only. Two-course dinner for two from around \u00a360. Value for money? Fun, affordable and stylish is hard to come by, and this has a great location, too, so yes \u2013 although it loses a point or two for charging extra for breakfast. \u2022 mamashelter.com Antonia Wilson Inhabit, Paddington, W2 What\u2019s it like? To get to \u201cLondon\u2019s first mindful boutique hotel\u201d, as Inhabit calls itself, I walk from Paddington station, mid-construction frenzy, along some of the capital\u2019s least zen streets, past fast-food joints, souvenir shops and roadworks. The hotel, set across six Georgian townhouses, is covered in scaffolding (the hotel is still in a soft-opening phase) but once I\u2019m through the door, Inhabit\u2019s Scandi-inspired interior dotted with plants exudes calmness. The first thing I notice is the wellness programme at the front desk (of which more later); the reception, dominated by a woollen wall hanging, leads into the library, painted grey and blue, and furnished with Danish chairs, and bespoke pieces by Goldfinger Factory, a local social enterprise. Cushions are by Hertfordshire-based Aerende, which sells homewares made by vulnerable people in the UK. The hotel is clearly paying more than lip service in its commitment to wellbeing, thinking about its responsibilities beyond its guests: during the renovation, a link-up with Globechain helped reduce the amount of waste sent to landfill; in keeping with its aim to be single-use plastic free there\u2019s bottled water on tap on each floor and re-useable glass coffee cups for sale in reception. Daily wellness sessions include morning meditation (free), yoga (\u00a310 a class) and guided walks (\u00a310) into nearby Hyde Park. This week, meditation pods with headphones are being installed providing a space for guests to have a 10-minute guided session. I\u2019m booked in for a Yin yoga class, which involves lying down for a series of very gentle stretches \u2013 or \u201cconstructive rest\u201d as the teacher puts it. It does the trick: the muscle tightness after a day sat in front of a computer screen disappears. A session in the infrared sauna (free) compounds my sense of relaxation. I\u2019m all set for an early night \u2013 and to see if Casper mattresses live up to the hype. What about breakfast and dinner? Food is by Yeotown Kitchen \u2013 a spin-off of the Devon-based luxury retreat of the same name \u2013 and is mainly plant-based, healthy and seasonal. Instead of the usual cereals and pastries, the breakfast buffet offers rice porridge with coconut milk, roast vegetables and frittata. I pour what I think is orange juice but get a surprise when I take a slug of tart, tumeric-infused ginger \u201celixir\u201d. I decide I like it. Tumeric appears in several of the \u00e0 la carte breakfast dishes, too (such as eggs royale, which comes with a dairy-free hollandaise, smoked salmon optional, \u00a39). Smashed avo is a given, of course, but there are more exotic dishes too that take almost as long to say as to eat: orange blossom tigernut-flour muffin-top pancakes with coconut yoghurt and berry compote, for one. The drinks are even more intriguing: a \u201cmedicinal mushroom latte\u201d made with mushrooms and maple syrup. I have a moment picturing Patsy from Ab Fab ordering a smoothie the morning after the night before, and I admit, I ordered a plain old coffee with normal milk, but as more of us give up meat or take a flexitarian approach, it\u2019s refreshing to see a hotel offering something other than croissants and fry-ups. If you\u2019re on the hotel\u2019s room-only rate, and don\u2019t want to pay to eat breakfast in (\u00a315 for the buffet or dishes from \u00a36 on the a la carte menu), there are plenty of nearby options: giant sticky pastries at Bonne Bouche on Praed Street, and an array of artisan coffee shops around Paddington Basin and Little Venice, including the Department of Coffee and Social Affairs and Beany Green. From next month the hotel restaurant will offer a dinner menu (until 9pm). Until then recommended restaurants are in your room directory. What\u2019s on the doorstep? Some of London\u2019s most tranquil spots are within walking distance: Hyde Park is a 10-minute stroll south, with acres to explore plus the Serpentine Gallery, the swimming and boating lake and Princess Diana Memorial Fountain; and Kensington Palace is in the adjoining in Kensington Gardens. Walk by the water from Paddington Basin (now a popular SUP spot) to Little Venice, another enclave where you almost forget you\u2019re in the city; a stroll north-east along the canal, past John Nash\u2019s grand Regent\u2019s Park houses and London Zoo, brings you to Camden. How much? Doubles from \u00a3150 room-only. Value for money? The area has cheaper options if a bed for the night is all that\u2019s needed (relative newcomer Pilgrm, for example) but I checked out feeling like I\u2019d been on a mini-retreat \u2013 and that seemed like a result considering I hadn\u2019t left London. \u2022 inhabithotels.com Isabel Choat The William IV, Kensal Green, NW10 What\u2019s it like? A handsome 200-year-old pub on the Harrow Road, which had already been a main highway out of London for centuries when this establishment opened during the year of William IV\u2019s death in 1837. Ground-floor spaces now flow into one linked bar and dining area, where low lighting gleams off polished wood and the patina of vintage-style leather sofas. Nautical knick-knacks, including splendid model ships, are a nod to the eponymous monarch, called the Sailor King. Three venerable Harrow Road pubs closed recently for redevelopment as flats, so the determination of the William IV\u2019s new owners late last year to recreate a pub from what had become a shisha bar, DJ venue and grotty bedsits is to be applauded. The 15 spacious en suite rooms are plain and simple, with feature fireplaces and pale walls. They have carpets so thick you could almost sleep on them rather than in the comfy beds. White tile-and-marble bathrooms are also minimalist. Ask for a room at the back if you\u2019re a light sleeper: the Harrow Road traffic is noisy. What about breakfast and dinner? The walk along Harrow Road from Kensal Green station (Bakerloo line and Overground) yields not a single cafe, pub or restaurant, so the imaginative gastropub-style menu is particularly welcome. A starter of wild mushrooms with crispy kale and white bean hummus (\u00a35) is so tasty I forget it\u2019s vegan, and my husband\u2019s chorizo and cannellini on sourdough is like beans on toast\u2019s more delicious self. Sunday lunch is particularly good, with meat for the whole table on big platters, with tureens of veg. Dorothy\u2019s Gin Garden offers outdoor seating, exotic gins on display and an interesting cocktail list. Breakfast in the dining room is excellent: coffee, with sourdough bread and pastries, plus a good cold selection of cheeses, meats and fruit. What\u2019s on the doorstep? Opposite stands verdant 72-acre Kensal Green cemetery, inspired by Paris\u2019s P\u00e8re Lachaise, with the Grand Union canal on one side. Notable residents include Isambard Kingdom Brunel, Wilkie Collins, Anthony Trollope, William Makepeace Thackeray and one WH Smith, \u201cmerchant\u201d. The stucco mansions and leafy squares of Notting Hill are about a mile away. Buses run from outside the pub to Wembley Stadium (25 minutes). How much? Doubles from \u00a3110 B&amp;B. Value for money? Pretty good given the period surroundings and friendly welcome, particularly for those who need to be in west London. \u2022 williamiv.london Liz Boulter The Buxton, Brick Lane, E1 What\u2019s it like? A red-brick and stone building on Osborn Street at the bottom of curry mile Brick Lane. It\u2019s a new venture by the people who run The Culpeper, less than 200 metres away on the corner of Commercial Street. The handsome late-Georgian building has been smartened up, with a bar-restaurant on the ground floor and 15 bedrooms spread over the upper four storeys. The bar area is now light and airy with floor-to ceiling windows, yet retains the feel of a pub \u2013 open doors, and stools round the bar, with a good view of the small open kitchen, and at a handful of high tables. Once the Archers Tavern, it has been renamed after Thomas Buxton, campaigner against slavery and capital punishment, co-founder of the RSPCA and all-round good egg, who lived up the street. The bedrooms are bijou, with a clean, functional feel: bare brick painted brilliant white, wiring hidden in aluminium tubes, TV, coffee and tea things on a small chest of drawers. The washbasin is in the room, making the shower and loo less of a squash \u2013 the obscured-glass sliding door on the loo/shower affords, well, only minimal privacy, however. Despite the urban location, double-glazed sash windows keep the night passably peaceful. What about breakfast and dinner? Busy leather-aproned chefs in the open kitchen produce modern European dishes from a short menu, including a fish of the day dependent on what has just been landed on the south coast. Bar snacks are a million miles from the East End\u2019s traditional pickled eggs: rillettes (\u00a35), terrine (\u00a36), radishes with cod roe \u2013 though there is a portion of chips for \u00a34. From four starters we choose a chilled pea soup (made extra special with perfectly roasted hazelnuts), and scallops with garlic butter and samphire. Equally seasonal is a plate of fresh tagliatelle with courgettes, ricotta and shaved raw asparagus. Husband\u2019s fish of the day (\u00a315) is a good-looking chunk of cod in a deeply sweet-savoury shellfish jus, but I do find the lack of any vegan main surprising given this is east London in 2019. Breakfast is equally imaginative \u2013 though with nothing for vegetarians or vegans: ham and eggs with ethereally light and crispy r\u00f6sti for him, while I make a veggie option by declining the merguez sausage with my tasty harissa-baked eggs. Excellent coffee and nice pastries, though. What\u2019s on the doorstep? It is Ramadan when we stay, so there is a celebratory air at sundown as Muslims break their fast and head to the mosque on Brick Lane, which is also, in sharp contrast, home to late-night bars and clubs such as Big Chill and 93 Feet East, as well as myriad curry houses and two famous bagel joints. By day, Petticoat Lane and Spitalfields markets are minutes away, as is Whitechapel Gallery. How much? Doubles \u00a3100 B&amp;B. Value for money? Excellent, given the location close to the City and party-central Shoreditch, particularly with breakfast included. \u2022 thebuxton.co.uk LB Red Lion, Leytonstone, E11 What\u2019s it like? On a dark, stormy Monday evening, the Red Lion is a welcoming beacon on a corner of Leytonstone High Road. Inside, to a 1960s soundtrack, we have a relaxed dinner, drink Malbec over Scrabble \u2013 and have the bonus of rolling into bed just upstairs. The pub\u2019s 10 new bedrooms are finished in heritage-green tones with floral papered walls, heavy velvet drapes, exposed brickwork and antique furniture. My room is a superior double on the second floor, accessible via the main pub or a side door. It is boutique hotel meets Peaky Blinders: clean lines with 1920s details, unpretentiously cool and a little bit sexy. The room is at the front of the building, which, being on a night-bus route, proves noisy at times. The overall location, though, is great: just three minutes\u2019 walk from Leytonstone tube station, which takes you to the city in 10 minutes. First established as a pub in 1670, the Red Lion has been through several incarnations \u2013 including a salsa bar and music venue, and was one of the first places Led Zeppelin played in London \u2013 before becoming a pub again in 2011. The building was rescued by Antic (the team behind pubs across London, among them the Dogstar DJ bar in Brixton) who gave the space a living-room vibe, with mismatched vintage seating and a big beer garden. There\u2019s a quiz night on Mondays, DJs (Fri and Sat, 9pm-2am), and roasts served on Sundays. What about breakfast and dinner? The food is great. There are seasonal menus for lunch and dinner, plus bar snacks including cauliflower-cheese croquettes (\u00a35.50) and venison-and-chorizo scotch eggs. We have the smoked mackerel pat\u00e9 with pickled beetroot (\u00a36); mussels, in a creamy saffron and parsley sauce (\u00a36); a pearl-barley risotto with slow-roast tomatoes, kale, baked ricotta, artichoke and beetroot crisps (\u00a311); and a mammoth plate of sausage and mash with savoy cabbage and onion gravy (\u00a38). Also on the menu, slow-cooked lamb ragu rigatoni (\u00a312); a beetroot and quinoa burger with caramelised onions and goat\u2019s cheese (\u00a310); and a chocolate pot with rosemary biscuits and candied orange peel (\u00a35.50). You can make tea and coffee in the rooms, but breakfast isn\u2019t served here. What\u2019s on the doorstep? For breakfast, the Wild Goose Bakery is a few doors down, or Le Petit Corner is a five-minute walk away on the same street. Head to nearby The Birds for themed, bottomless brunches; peruse limited-run prints at Hooksmith Press and sip cocktails at the Heathcote and Star. A few miles down the road, in Walthamstow, the William Morris Gallery and Vestry House Museum provide culture between eating and drinking. Favourites here include Eat17, Orford Saloon tapas and In Vino Veritas wine bar, in the village; And, close to God\u2019s Own Junkyard neon art gallery, Ravenswood industrial estate has microbreweries and a gin palace. How much? Doubles from \u00a383 room-only. Two-course dinner for two with wine, around \u00a350. Value for money? For the location, yes, and dinner and drinks won\u2019t break the bank, either. \u2022 theredlionleytonstone.com AW",

It was a ploy. Johnson\u2019s brinkmanship in getting this far had, in effect, been to threaten everybody with everything: making enough Brexit hardliners fear that if they didn\u2019t accept his deal there would be a second referendum; and makingenough remain MPs fear that if they didn\u2019t accept his deal there would be no deal.</p> <p>On this thin and fraying thread hung his strategy to push through his deal by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/24/boris-johnson-becomes-pm-with-promise-of-brexit-by-31-october\" title=\"\">self-imposed deadline</a> of 31 October.

But with a general election imminent, it\u2019s worth casting a critical eye over the role journalism is playing in our politics.</p> <p>When the polling industry gave us misleading predictions in the run-up to the 1992 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/13/new-research-general-election-polls-inaccurate\" title=\"\">2015 elections</a>, it understood that the reputation of the profession was at risk and set up inquiries to work out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/13/new-research-general-election-polls-inaccurate\" title=\"\">what had gone wrong</a>. After the Iraq war, several outlets, including the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/30/weekinreview/the-public-editor-weapons-of-mass-destruction-or-mass-distraction.html\" title=\"\">New York Times</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/aug/13/pressandpublishing.usa\" title=\"\">Washington Post</a>, published lengthy internal investigations into why and how they had misread the war\u2019s buildup and the claims over weapons of mass destruction. Despite a series of clear failures, the British media has gone through no such process.</p> <p>Many of the inequalities we see in our political class \u2013 its concentration in London, its class and racial bias \u2013 are replicated in the media class, shaping what Gramsci termed a prevailing \u201ccommon sense\u201d. A <a href=\"https://www.suttontrust.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Elitist-Britain-2019-Summary-Report.pdf\" title=\"\">report</a> by the Sutton Trust and Social Mobility Commission this year shows there\u2019s a higher proportion of Oxbridge graduates writing columns at present than there is sitting in the House of Lords.

The former comes from a place that is craven \u2013 suggesting a greater desire to be trusted by those in authority than by readers or viewers. The problem is not that they don\u2019t know how to be sceptical: they were sceptical of Saddam Hussein when he said he had no WMD, or of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/10/mark-duggan-shooting-family-settle-high-court-claim-against-met\" title=\"\">Mark Duggan\u2019s family</a> when they said he didn\u2019t have a gun. But when it comes to those in power they all too often err on the side of defence and credulity.</p> <p>The latter has been the result of a chronic lack of curiosity, underpinned by crippling cynicism towards new orthodoxies and possibilities. But where the two transgressions meet is in the belief that the establishment is to be trusted, either in its pronouncements or its framing, and always given the space to make its case unchallenged in a world where its <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/britain/2018/12/22/the-elite-that-failed\" title=\"\">legitimacy and credibility is withering away</a>.</p> <p>With attacks on journalists on the rise, when the profession finds itself in the crosshairs of authoritarians, it is important to defend the media and those who work in it from the despot and the populist. Being honest about our shortcomings is central to that defence. In a period of rampant inequality, entrenched division and diminishing trust, we are most effective when we challenge the powerful, not when we embed ourselves among them.</p> <p>\u2022 Gary Younge is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Johnson\u2019s brinkmanship in getting this far had, in effect, been to threaten everybody with everything: making enough Brexit hardliners fear that if they didn\u2019t accept his deal there would be a second referendum; and makingenough remain MPs fear that if they didn\u2019t accept his deal there would be no deal. On this thin and fraying thread hung his strategy to push through his deal by the self-imposed deadline of 31 October. But when faced with defeat, the government did not pull the bill. It paused the process. It was an empty threat. The only thing that made it plausible was the uncritical, unattributable reporting of it. Johnson did not invent playing the media in this way \u2013 though given his reputation for brazen dishonesty, the media\u2019s gullibility was particularly egregious. But with a general election imminent, it\u2019s worth casting a critical eye over the role journalism is playing in our politics. When the polling industry gave us misleading predictions in the run-up to the 1992 and 2015 elections, it understood that the reputation of the profession was at risk and set up inquiries to work out what had gone wrong. After the Iraq war, several outlets, including the New York Times and the Washington Post, published lengthy internal investigations into why and how they had misread the war\u2019s buildup and the claims over weapons of mass destruction. Despite a series of clear failures, the British media has gone through no such process. Many of the inequalities we see in our political class \u2013 its concentration in London, its class and racial bias \u2013 are replicated in the media class, shaping what Gramsci termed a prevailing \u201ccommon sense\u201d. A report by the Sutton Trust and Social Mobility Commission this year shows there\u2019s a higher proportion of Oxbridge graduates writing columns at present than there is sitting in the House of Lords. Between them they settle on a consensus of what, and who, matters and then subject those outside their sphere to coverage that is more akin to anthropology than journalism. The upshot was most clearly witnessed during the 2017 general election, where the prospect of a Labour rout was not so much an opinion as a fact waiting to happen. Minutes before the polls closed, Piers Morgan tweeted his prediction: \u201cConservatives to win by 90-100 seat majority.\u201d Four minutes later the Sun\u2019s deputy political editor Steve Hawkes shared: \u201cRumour Tories could be looking at 400 seats.\u201d When the exit poll suggested a hung parliament, in which Labour had actually gained seats and vote share, the televised choreography could not have provided a clearer metaphor. \u201cWell, now let\u2019s go back to the studio to ask those who got everything wrong so far what will happen next.\u201d They still have the mic. There was no reckoning. They are still out there forecasting the future. The mea culpas that followed that debacle were too narrowly tailored. Commentators lamented that they had predicted the wrong result, as though their job was to foresee the future. It wasn\u2019t. The problem was that they had chronically misportrayed the present, mistaking their own political prejudice for the situation they were actually covering. There are important differences between the kind of malpractice behind the cavalier use of unattributed quotes by a few senior journalists, and the wider failure to interrogate and understand the shifts in British politics. The former comes from a place that is craven \u2013 suggesting a greater desire to be trusted by those in authority than by readers or viewers. The problem is not that they don\u2019t know how to be sceptical: they were sceptical of Saddam Hussein when he said he had no WMD, or of Mark Duggan\u2019s family when they said he didn\u2019t have a gun. But when it comes to those in power they all too often err on the side of defence and credulity. The latter has been the result of a chronic lack of curiosity, underpinned by crippling cynicism towards new orthodoxies and possibilities. But where the two transgressions meet is in the belief that the establishment is to be trusted, either in its pronouncements or its framing, and always given the space to make its case unchallenged in a world where its legitimacy and credibility is withering away. With attacks on journalists on the rise, when the profession finds itself in the crosshairs of authoritarians, it is important to defend the media and those who work in it from the despot and the populist. Being honest about our shortcomings is central to that defence. In a period of rampant inequality, entrenched division and diminishing trust, we are most effective when we challenge the powerful, not when we embed ourselves among them. \u2022 Gary Younge is a Guardian columnist",

Belgian officials said the eight women and 31 men would have been locked in the trailer at temperatures as low as -25C for at least 10 hours. The Zeebrugge port CEO said the trailer would have been sealed and not interfered with after it arrived, while the mayor of Bruges, Dirk de Fauw, said: \u201c[To] break the seal, bring 39 people onboard and apply a new seal without being noticed, that chance is extremely small.\u201d Chinese migrants hoping to reach the UK can typically pay smugglers anything up to \u00a314,000 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/24/china-uk-people-trafficking-often-driven-by-debt-experts-say\">may then find themselves in debt bondage</a>, according to experts who work with them. We have reconstructed the journey of the trailer from Zeebrugge, the tractor unit from Dublin, some of the companies involved in their passage and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/24/two-journeys-into-one-how-lorry-driver-and-chinese-nationals-reached-essex\">how they came together in Purfleet</a> before authorities were alerted to the bodies inside.

Between a quarter and a third of all house sales fall through, resulting in stress and the losses for parties involved add up to hundreds of millions of pounds. Acceptable reasons, writes Rupert Neate, might include a bereavement, losing your job or an inability to obtain a mortgage. Unacceptable reasons might be a change of mind, the buyer lowering their offer at the last minute or, similarly, the seller accepting a higher offer. Some estate agents are already using the \u201creservation agreements\u201d.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Exclusions \u2018fuel knife crime\u2019 \u2013 </strong>All-party MPs and peers have warned the government that being expelled from school can be the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/25/reform-school-exclusions-to-tackle-knife-mps-urge\">tipping point for a young person to take up a knife</a>. One young person told the group that being kicked out meant \u201cI\u2019ve got time on my hands to do more crime, commit more crime \u2026 [with my friends] who are also carrying knives\u201d. The parliamentarians\u2019 report calls for schools to be given the funding to support vulnerable children, with a focus on prevention and early intervention. In 2017/18 there were 7,900 permanent exclusions from schools in England \u2013 a 70% increase since 2012/13. At the same time, there has been a \u201cworrying\u201d rise in youth knife crime with more than 17,500 boys aged 14 in England and Wales carrying one.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Trump sows more Syria chaos \u2013 </strong>In a reversal of Donald Trump\u2019s order to withdraw all troops from Syria, the US is reportedly planning to deploy tanks and other heavy military hardware to protect oilfields in the country\u2019s east. The most likely destination for US armoured units is a Conoco gas plant near the city of Deir Ezzor. Julian Borger writes that it is likely to require <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/24/us-military-syria-tanks-oil-fields\">more troops than the roughly 1,000 whom the president promised he was \u201cbringing home\u201d</a> by letting Turkey invade Kurdish-held territory. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/oct/25/turkey-accused-of-using-threats-and-deception-to-deport-syrian-refugees\">forcing Kurds out of north-eastern Syria</a> and wants to resettle it with Syrian Arab refugees. The mass demographic change \u2013 carried out at the barrel of a gun \u2013 risks prolonging Syria\u2019s conflict indefinitely, says Jan Egeland, the UN\u2019s former humanitarian chief: \u201cWe need to remind all of these people with the power and the guns that this is no chessboard. It is a place where people live.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Wind could power world \u2013 </strong>Wind turbines on the world\u2019s best offshore sites could provide more than enough clean energy to meet global electricity demand, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has calculated. The detailed analysis says that if windfarms are built across all useable sites no further than 37 miles off the coast, and where coastal waters are no deeper than 60 metres, they could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/24/offshore-windfarms-can-provide-more-electricity-than-the-world-needs\">generate 36,000 terrawatt hours of renewable electricity a year</a>. Current global demand is 23,000 terrawatt hours. Offshore wind would not only contribute to generating clean electricity, but that electricity could also be used to produce hydrogen to replace fossil fuels. In the North Sea, energy companies are already planning to use electricity from giant offshore windfarms to turn seawater into hydrogen and pump it to shore.</p> \n<h2>Today in Focus podcast: Brothers torn apart</h2> \n<p>Among the refugees from the nine-year war in Syria were five brothers from the south-western city of Dara\u2019a, where the uprising against the Assad regime began.

Jeremy Corbyn appears poised to block Boris Johnson\u2019s offer of a pre-Christmas general election by telling his MPs to abstain in Monday\u2019s vote. The Labour leader underlined his pledge to back an early election when a no-deal Brexit scenario can be firmly ruled out. It is understood Corbyn will make a final decision once the EU27 have confirmed what extension the UK will be offered. Johnson\u2019s offer is to allow MPs to debate his EU withdrawal bill agreement until 6 November.

The parliamentarians\u2019 report calls for schools to be given the funding to support vulnerable children, with a focus on prevention and early intervention. In 2017/18 there were 7,900 permanent exclusions from schools in England \u2013 a 70% increase since 2012/13. At the same time, there has been a \u201cworrying\u201d rise in youth knife crime with more than 17,500 boys aged 14 in England and Wales carrying one. * * * Trump sows more Syria chaos \u2013 In a reversal of Donald Trump\u2019s order to withdraw all troops from Syria, the US is reportedly planning to deploy tanks and other heavy military hardware to protect oilfields in the country\u2019s east. The most likely destination for US armoured units is a Conoco gas plant near the city of Deir Ezzor. Julian Borger writes that it is likely to require more troops than the roughly 1,000 whom the president promised he was \u201cbringing home\u201d by letting Turkey invade Kurdish-held territory. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, is forcing Kurds out of north-eastern Syria and wants to resettle it with Syrian Arab refugees. The mass demographic change \u2013 carried out at the barrel of a gun \u2013 risks prolonging Syria\u2019s conflict indefinitely, says Jan Egeland, the UN\u2019s former humanitarian chief: \u201cWe need to remind all of these people with the power and the guns that this is no chessboard. It is a place where people live.\u201d * * * Wind could power world \u2013 Wind turbines on the world\u2019s best offshore sites could provide more than enough clean energy to meet global electricity demand, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has calculated. The detailed analysis says that if windfarms are built across all useable sites no further than 37 miles off the coast, and where coastal waters are no deeper than 60 metres, they could generate 36,000 terrawatt hours of renewable electricity a year. Current global demand is 23,000 terrawatt hours. Offshore wind would not only contribute to generating clean electricity, but that electricity could also be used to produce hydrogen to replace fossil fuels. In the North Sea, energy companies are already planning to use electricity from giant offshore windfarms to turn seawater into hydrogen and pump it to shore. Today in Focus podcast: Brothers torn apart Among the refugees from the nine-year war in Syria were five brothers from the south-western city of Dara\u2019a, where the uprising against the Assad regime began. They are now dispersed across five countries \u2013 Michael Safi tells Anushka Asthana how he set out to track them down. And as Boris Johnson pushes for an election, the Labour MP Lisa Nandy argues it is time for her colleagues to put aside their differences and vote for an amended version of the PM\u2019s Brexit deal. Lunchtime read: Why do people hate vegans so much? One vegan-baiter ate a squirrel and, later, a pig\u2019s head in front of them, while brandishing the slogan \u201cVeganism = Malnutrition\u201d. A NatWest customer seeking a loan was told \u201call vegans should be punched in the face\u201d. A charge commonly laid against vegans is that they relish their status as victims, but research suggests they have earned it. In 2015 a study observed that vegetarians and vegans in western society \u2013 and vegans in particular \u2013 experience discrimination and bias on a par with ethnic and religious minorities. George Reynolds writes that recent displays of enmity towards vegans represent a \u201cpuzzling escalation in hostilities, just as a consensus is starting to form that eating less meat would almost certainly be better for everyone \u2013 and the Earth\u201d. Sport Eddie Jones has urged England to knock New Zealand off their perch and replace them as the dominant force in world rugby, calling on his players to \u201cchange history\u201d in Saturday\u2019s World Cup semi-final. Liam Williams has been ruled out of the tournament and will miss Wales\u2019s clash with South Africa after the full-back picked up an ankle injury in training. Two goals from P\u00e9p\u00e9 gave Arsenal a 3-2 Europa League victory after they had trailed 2-1 at home to Vit\u00f3ria Guimar\u00e3es. Elsewhere, Manchester United beat Partizan Belgrade 1-0 thanks to Anthony Martial\u2019s first-half penalty and Celtic beat Lazio 2-1 but had to wait until the 89th minute for Christopher Jullien to score the winner. Anfield will host a Women\u2019s Super League game for the first time next month \u2013 and making the occasion particularly special, the fixture will be the Merseyside derby. Lewis Hamilton has robustly defended his environmental concerns, having received strident criticism for recent posts on Instagram. Kane Williamson\u2019s reunion with England has been delayed after the New Zealand captain was ruled out of the Twenty20 series with a hip problem. And the Houston Astros have fired assistant general manager Brandon Taubman following an investigation into a clubhouse outburst directed toward a group of female reporters. Business Asian shares have been mixed, after Wall Street indexes posted modest gains, cheered by solid profits and forecasts from US technology companies. Japan\u2019s benchmark Nikkei 225 inched up less than 0.1% in morning trading to 22,747.98. Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX 200 gained 0.6% to 6,734.40. South Korea\u2019s Kospi was little changed, inching down to 2,085.45. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng dipped 0.5% to 26,674.40, while the Shanghai Composite slipped 0.5% to 2,925.55. The FTSE is a shade higher ahead of the opening and a pound is worth $1.284 or \u20ac1.156 at time of writing. The papers Election speculation hangs in the air and on the front pages of most of the papers, including the Guardian: \u201cJohnson tells MPs: back my December 12 election bid\u201d, the Telegraph: \u201cEnd this nightmare, Johnson tells Corbyn\u201d, the FT: \u201cJohnson challenges Corbyn to end deadlock with December election\u201d, the Times: \u201cLabour in chaos over election bid by Johnson\u201d and the i: \u201cChristmas election stand-off\u201d. The Mirror has: \u201cSnakehead gang hunted\u201d, with a report that Chinese gangsters are feared to be behind the death of the 39 people found dead in a lorry in Essex. The Express has: \u201cThank you for saving our lives\u201d, with the news that NHS England has agreed a deal with producer of a drug for cystic fibrosis after a long campaign. The Mail is also celebrating victorious results of campaigns, a new MMR vaccine plan and the climbdown from Barclays over its plans to stop letting customers withdraw cash at post offices, with the headline: \u201cThe day you made your voice heard\u201d.

Labor\u2019s sport spokesman, Don Farrell, has seized on the evidence at Senate estimates, first reported by the ABC, to claim the program is \u201cdodgy\u201d and demand an explanation as to why the former sport minister rejected the applications. The community sport infrastructure program shot to prominence in February when the Liberal candidate for Mayo, Georgina Downer, presented a $127,373 taxpayer-funded grant \u2013 featuring her face and Liberal party logos \u2013 to the Yankalilla bowling club. The auditor general agreed to review the program after a complaint from Labor and is due to report in November. The Sport Australia chief executive, Kate Palmer, told a committee hearing on Wednesday that the 684 projects which were ultimately approved by the minister \u201cmay not have [all] been\u201d recommended by her organisation. Palmer revealed that, in round one of the program, 293 projects were recommended by Sports Australia but rejected by the minister, followed by 141 in round two and 184 in the final round, a total of 618 applications. Palmer took on notice how many times McKenzie approved grants that Sports Australia had recommended not receive funding. \u201cAs the delegate, the minister was able to approve the grants and make the final decisions about the grants,\u201d she said. Farrell reportedly said: \u201cThe minister, we now know, rejected advice from her own department, Sport Australia, as to who should get these grants, and she imposed her own favourite grants in their place.\u201d Across three rounds, the program delivered a total of 176 grants worth $25m in McKenzie\u2019s home state of Victoria.

      "body": "<p>From the hunger strike to the edible projectile, history offers abundant examples of food being used for political ends. Even so, the crowd of vegans who gathered in central London earlier this year are unlikely to forget the moment when Gatis Lagzdins skinned and ate a raw squirrel.</p> <p>Along with his co-conspirator Deonisy Khlebnikov, Lagzdins <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/23/pro-meat-protesters-fined-eating-raw-squirrels-vegan-stall\" title=\"\">performed</a> his stunt at the weekly Soho Vegan Market on Rupert Street. He would subsequently demonstrate at VegFest in Brighton (although this time his snack of choice was a raw pig\u2019s head) as part of a self-proclaimed \u201ccarnivore tour\u201d intended to highlight the evils of a plant-based diet. At the London event, he wore a black vest emblazoned with the slogan: \u201cVeganism = Malnutrition.\u201d</p> <p>The war on vegans started small. There were flashpoints, some outrageous enough to receive press coverage. There was the episode in which William Sitwell, then editor of Waitrose magazine, resigned after a freelance writer leaked an email exchange in which he joked about \u201ckilling vegans one by one\u201d. (Sitwell has since apologised.) There was the PR nightmare faced by Natwest bank when a customer calling to apply for a loan was told by an employee that \u201call vegans should be punched in the face\u201d. When animal rights protesters stormed into a Brighton Pizza Express in September this year, one diner did exactly that.</p> <p>A charge commonly laid against vegans is that they relish their status as victims, but research suggests they have earned it. In 2015, a <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1368430215618253\" title=\"\">study</a> conducted by Cara C MacInnis and Gordon Hodson and published in the journal Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations observed that vegetarians and vegans in western society \u2013 and vegans in particular \u2013 experience discrimination and bias on a par with other minorities.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3d47e3d51cb32c61ab63affa0a214573c9e59780\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d47e3d51cb32c61ab63affa0a214573c9e59780/160_222_3846_2309/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mushroom cloud cauliflower\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Once a niche interest group parodied in TV shows such as The Simpsons (in which a character describes himself as a \u201clevel five vegan\u201d who refuses to eat anything that casts a shadow), in the past two years, vegans have been thrust into the limelight. A philosophy rooted in non-aggression has found itself at the heart of some of the most virulent arguments on social media. In November 2018, Good Morning Britain hosted a debate titled \u201cDo people hate vegans?\u201d; the political website Vox tackled the question in even more direct fashion a week later, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/11/2/18055532/vegans-vegetarian-research-uk\" title=\"\">asking</a>: \u201cWhy do people hate vegans so much?\u201d</p> <p>These recent displays of enmity towards vegans represent a puzzling escalation in hostilities, just as a consensus is starting to form that eating less meat would almost certainly be better for everyone \u2013 and the Earth. Of course, eating less meat does not mean eating no meat whatsoever, and the extreme prohibitions associated with going vegan (no animal products, no eggs, no leather, no wool) suggest it could have been just another Atkins diet or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/aug/11/why-we-fell-for-clean-eating\" title=\"\">clean-eating</a> fad \u2013 a flash in the pan that blows up and then dissipates, leaving behind nothing more than a dose of mild regret. Instead, just when the growth might have been expected to plateau, it kept on growing. A 2016 Ipsos Mori survey suggested the total number of vegans in the UK had increased more than 360% in the preceding decade, to more than 500,000.</p> <p>Big business has been quick to cash in. The Los Angeles-based company Beyond Meat, producer of plant-based burgers whose taste and texture are as much like minced beef as possible, recently went public and soon afterwards hit a valuation of $3.4bn; huge conglomerates such as Nestl\u00e9 and Kellogg\u2019s are moving into the fake-meat market; supermarkets and restaurant chains have introduced vegan ranges. Yet perhaps the definitive proof of veganism\u2019s mainstreaming \u2013 and the backlash against it \u2013 came in January this year, when the beloved high-street bakery chain Greggs announced it was launching a Quorn-based vegan sausage roll. It was pilloried by Piers Morgan, who tweeted: \u201cNobody was waiting for a vegan bloody sausage, you PC-ravaged clowns.\u201d It turns out Morgan was mistaken: the vegan sausage roll was such a hit that the company\u2019s share value <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/may/14/greggs-vegan-sausage-rolls-fuel-profit-boom\" title=\"\">leapt by 13%</a>.</p> <p>Of course, what we grow, harvest, fatten and kill is political. A <a href=\"https://www.livekindly.co/watch-tescos-controversial-new-vegan-sausage-commercial/\" title=\"\">Tesco advert</a> showcasing vegan produce met protests from the National Farmers Union who claimed it \u201cdemonised\u201d meat, while Shropshire deputy council leader Steve Charmley <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jan/05/bus-ads-for-veganism-are-a-disgrace-says-conservative-shropshire-councillor\" title=\"\">unleashed</a> a tweet-storm when confronted with pro-vegan advertising in a county he claimed was \u201cbuilt on agriculture\u201d. This moment, and this conflict, were a long time coming. The rise of veganism is a question less of personal taste than of generational upheaval; less about meat and fish and dairy than the systems that put them on our tables in such excessive quantities. Ultimately, the vegan wars are not really about veganism at all, but about how individual freedom is coming into conflict with a personal and environmental health crisis.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In many cultures, the practice of abstaining entirely from animal produce has an established history: with their belief systems rooted in nonviolence, many Rastafarians, followers of Jainism and certain sects of Buddhism have been swearing off meat, fish, eggs and dairy for centuries. In large swathes of the west, though, public awareness of what veganism actually entails has been sketchy. There wasn\u2019t even a commonly accepted English-language name until 1944, when a British woodworker called Donald Watson called a meeting with a handful of other non-dairy vegetarians (including his wife, Dorothy) to discuss a less cumbersome label for their lifestyle. They <a href=\"https://www.vegansociety.com/about-us/history\" title=\"\">considered</a> alternatives such as dairyban, vitan and benevore before settling on the term we use today, a simple contraction of vegetarian on the grounds that \u201cveganism starts with vegetarianism and carries it through to its logical conclusions\u201d.</p> <p>But those logical conclusions did not stop at abstaining from certain foods. The original vegans were not pursuing a diet so much as a belief system, a wholesale ideology \u2013 one that rejected not just animal protein but also the way animals had become part of an industrial supply chain. In the 1970s, Carol J Adams started work on the book that would appear, two decades later, as The Sexual Politics of Meat: a seminal feminist text that positioned veganism as the only logical solution to a social system that reduced both women and animals to desirable, but disposable, flesh.</p> <p>In the early 70s, other activists were considering how veganism might provide a viable alternative to existing food systems. In 1971, Diet for a Small Planet by the social policy activist Frances Moore Lapp\u00e9 introduced an environmental justification for going vegetarian or vegan to a global audience (it eventually sold more than 3m copies). In the same year, counter-culture hero Stephen Gaskin founded a vegan intentional community, The Farm, in Lewis County, Tennessee, bringing together some 300 like-minded individuals. Four years later, The Farm Vegetarian Cookbook by Louise Hagler announced: \u201cWe are vegetarians because one-third of the world is starving and at least half goes to bed hungry every night,\u201d and introduced western audiences to techniques for making their own soy-based products such as tofu and tempeh.</p> <p>The Farm Vegetarian Cookbook fixed a certain vegan aesthetic in the minds of mainstream meat-eating culture for decades to come. Veganism became synonymous with soybeans and brown rice, with ageing hippies spooning beige bowlfuls of worthy grains and pulses \u2013 not the glamorous, vibrant, youthful practitioners that now radiate positivity from their Instagram feeds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d422441c2460d883cacfc9d37bd7c8e0a64b5151\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d422441c2460d883cacfc9d37bd7c8e0a64b5151/0_1020_7216_4330/1000.jpg\" alt=\"BBQ pulled jack fruit tacos with avocado and lime: a long way from the beige vegan food much parodied in the 70s.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">BBQ pulled jack fruit tacos with avocado and lime: a long way from the beige vegan food much parodied in the 70s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: LauriPatterson/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is hard to overstate the role social media has played in transforming veganism\u2019s image, with its facility for fostering an instant sense of community. Witness any number of viral internet phenomena \u2013 from Woman Laughing Alone with Salad to acai bowls and this generation\u2019s staple, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/may/15/australian-millionaire-millennials-avocado-toast-house\" title=\"\">avocado toast</a> \u2013 that have helped free it from its musty old associations. Instagram in particular gave vegan food mainstream exposure, repackaging it (good for you and photogenic!) for the low-attention-span internet age. Not everyone sees this as a positive development: the vegan writer and podcast host Alicia Kennedy considers it troubling that the internet has transformed something with such a rich political history into \u201ca wellness thing\u201d that allows would-be consumers to label themselves vegans without having to engage with the \u201cexcess baggage\u201d of ideology. Another American writer, Khushbu Shah, <a href=\"https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/vegan-race-wars-white-veganism\" title=\"\">has argued</a> that the popularisation of veganism via social media has erased non-white faces and narratives from the dominant discourse, as white bloggers and influencers fashion a lifestyle in their image.</p> <p>At the same time, a similar transformation was happening to the food vegans were eating. A blossoming street food scene in major cities influenced a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/05/hail-seitan-how-vegan-food-got-downndirty\" title=\"\">dirtier, trashier</a> vegan aesthetic that gave the diet a further boost. Recipe channels on YouTube and Facebook such as BOSH! \u2013 a glossy young male duo \u2013 used video to make stunt dishes (apple pie tacos; a plant-based take on a McDonald\u2019s McMuffin; a watermelon \u201cJaegerbomb\u201d) that injected some much-needed fun into the diet. (Tellingly, the BOSH! dudes, Henry Firth and Ian Theasby, refer to themselves not as chefs but \u201cfood remixers\u201d.)</p> <p>The language began to reflect a new, more approachable veganism. Descriptors such as \u201cplant-based\u201d gained in popularity, effectively rebranding the worthy brown stodge of popular imagination into something green and vital. Other neologisms such as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/01/third-of-britons-have-stopped-or-reduced-meat-eating-vegan-vegetarian-report\" title=\"\">flexitarian</a>\u201d (a term denoting someone who is predominantly vegan or vegetarian but who occasionally eats meat or fish, added to the Oxford English Dictionary in June 2014) recast daunting vegan ideology as a fun, healthy, casual thing to try.</p> <p>Cultish initiatives like Veganuary (an annual campaign encouraging people to go meat-free for the first month of the year, launched in 2014) and Meat Free Mondays tapped into this spirit \u2013 moving away from wholesale dietary transformation and towards something more manageably sporadic, with the added gloss of being able to share (that is, brag about) the experience online. Beyonc\u00e9 declared an interest in veganism \u2013 at least, for breakfast \u2013 while athletes such as Venus Williams (who took up a raw vegan diet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/jul/17/venus-williams-longevity-diet-wimbledon-tennis\" title=\"\">to combat</a> a health condition) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/aug/29/lewis-hamilton-invests-in-meat-free-chain-neat-burger\" title=\"\">Lewis Hamilton</a> played a vital role in raising awareness and turning something once seen as weird and a little annoying into a desirable lifestyle.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Helping the cause was the growing body of scientific literature suggesting that some of the processes that produce the modern western diet were catastrophically bad for us. Bee Wilson wrote in these pages about the health effects of processed pork in a piece titled \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/01/bacon-cancer-processed-meats-nitrates-nitrites-sausages\" title=\"\">Yes, bacon really is killing us</a>.\u201d Food in the Anthropocene, a report commissioned by the Lancet in conjunction with the global nonprofit Eat (a startup dedicated to transforming the global food system) concluded that \u201cunhealthy diets are the largest global burden of disease\u201d, and that meat-heavy food production is \u201cthe largest source of environmental degradation\u201d. A major study led by a team from Oxford University, published in the journal Nature in October 2018, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/10/huge-reduction-in-meat-eating-essential-to-avoid-climate-breakdown\" title=\"\">showed that</a> huge reductions in meat-eating are essential to slow the rate of climate change. Livestock production has been shown to lead to dangerous levels of deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions. Factor in pop-science phenomena like the documentaries Cowspiracy! and What the Health \u2013 available on Netflix \u2013 and your diet suddenly seemed like a way you could save the world.</p> <p>Big Meat continues to lobby aggressively in favour of our God-given right to eat animal flesh, resulting in a series of legal prohibitions surrounding what can and cannot be called \u201cmeat\u201d\u2019 or even \u2013 in one US state \u2013 a \u201cveggie burger\u201d. But veganism\u2019s virality has proved irresistible. From about 2015, vegan and plant-based cookery manuals started to proliferate at a dazzling rate, with the BOSH! boys selling upward of 80,000 copies and spending four weeks on the Sunday Times bestseller list (today, Amazon lists more than 20,000 results for the search term \u201cvegan cookbook\u201d). Sales of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/jan/29/white-gold-the-unstoppable-rise-of-alternative-milks-oat-soy-rice-coconut-plant\" title=\"\">plant milks</a> skyrocketed; financial results at the manufacturer of plant-based protein Quorn soared as what one analyst referred to as the \u201cbattle for the centre of the plate\u201d began to draw (fake) blood. By 2018, Byron, M&amp;S and Pret had invested heavily in vegan ranges. It was, this paper <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/dec/31/year-of-the-vegan-record-numbers-sign-up-for-veganuary\" title=\"\">proclaimed</a>, \u201cthe year that veganism moved out of the realms of counter-culture and into the mainstream\u201d. In 2014, Veganuary\u2019s inaugural campaign had attracted just 3,300 participants; by 2019 the number was greater than 250,000, with 53% of them under the age of 35.</p> <p>But veganism\u2019s explosive growth alone does not explain why it attracted such controversy. There is something inherent to veganism and vegans that arouses deeper feelings. What is it about the vegan lifestyle that stirs such strong emotion in those who don\u2019t happen to share it? Why do people hate vegans so much?</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Early attempts to establish a vegan utopia did not go well. In the 1840s, the transcendentalist philosopher Amos Bronson Alcott (father of the author of Little Women, Louisa May) founded Fruitlands in Harvard, Massachusetts \u2013 a vegan community intended to be nothing less than a second Eden. But Alcott\u2019s insistence that crops had to be planted and fields tilled by hand meant that not enough food could be grown for all of the members (even though the population peaked at just 13); a diet of fruit and grains, typically consumed raw, left participants severely malnourished. Just seven months after opening, Fruitlands closed \u2013 derided, in the words of one biographer, as \u201cone of history\u2019s most unsuccessful utopias\u201d.</p> <p>The timing was unfortunate for American vegetarians, who were already engaged in a pitched battle with public opinion. Vegetarians and vegans in the 19th century \u2013 known as Grahamites after the Presbyterian minister and diet reformer Sylvester Graham, who campaigned against meat-eating on the grounds that it was both unhealthy and morally repugnant \u2013 were the subject of frequent vitriolic editorials in the popular and medical press of the day, which described them as \u201ccadaverous\u201d, \u201cfeeble\u201d, \u201chalf-crazed\u201d, \u201csour-visaged\u201d and \u201cfood cranks\u201d.</p> <p>In the 21st century the terminology may have changed but the sentiment remains much the same. The 2015 study conducted by MacInnis and Hodson found that only drug addicts were viewed more negatively among respondents. It concluded: \u201cUnlike other forms of bias (eg, racism, sexism), negativity toward vegetarians and vegans is not widely considered a societal problem; rather, [it] is commonplace and largely accepted.\u201d</p> <p>In 2011, sociologists Matthew Cole and Karen Morgan observed a phenomenon they called \u201cvegaphobia\u201d, demonstrating that the British media consistently portrayed vegans in a negative light. In the days after her story broke, <a href=\"http://selenenelson.co.uk/the-telegraph-the-vegan-who-bit-back/\" title=\"\">Selene Nelson</a>, the freelancer at the centre of the Waitrose magazine row, was called \u201chumourless\u201d, \u201ccombative\u201d and \u201cmilitant\u201d. In 2017, residents of the Swiss town of Aargau reportedly called for a vegan foreign resident to be <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/world/vegan-denied-swiss-citizenship-by-neighbours-annoyed-at-her-animal-campaigns-20170112-gtpvpa.html\" title=\"\">denied citizenship</a> because she was \u201cannoying\u201d, and the glee with which the global media retold the story revealed a widespread and casual prejudice.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c0b7aee19a02363e82612cac2433d4aa2057e11c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c0b7aee19a02363e82612cac2433d4aa2057e11c/0_923_4480_4620/970.jpg\" alt=\"Beyond Meat\u2019s Beyond Spring burger.\" width=\"970\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beyond Meat\u2019s Beyond Spring burger.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Veganism\u2019s opponents outline a host of objections to the lifestyle to justify their hostility. Per a now-familiar joke (Q: How do you know if someone\u2019s vegan? A: Don\u2019t worry, they\u2019ll tell you), vegans are portrayed as preachy and sanctimonious, a characteristic that rankled among MacInnis and Hodson\u2019s respondents in particular, who viewed \u201cvegetarians/vegans more negatively when their motivations concern social justice rather than personal health\u201d.</p> <p>There are rational motives to oppose vegan diets on health grounds. They can be deficient in crucial nutrients such as vitamin B-12. This is especially notable in the case of extreme diets (such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2014/dec/03/-sp-trouble-with-fruitarians\" title=\"\">fruitarianism</a>) advocated by some vegan bloggers or Instagram influencers with unorthodox approaches to nutritional science. Various supermarket chains have also attempted to meet the burgeoning demand for vegan products with highly processed vegan ready meals \u2013 from the Impossible Burger to plant-based meatballs, goujons and hot dogs. As Bee Wilson argued in these pages, the high proportion of processed ingredients in these products means the so-called health halo they enjoy may well be illusory.</p> <p>Perhaps all we are doing, as veganism truly goes mainstream and companies such as Beyond Meat reap windfalls, is <a href=\"https://howwegettonext.com/the-future-of-the-veggie-burger-4a72c7c6423a\" title=\"\">replacing</a> one kind of industrialised system with another. Evidence suggests that intensive livestock farming is a poor solution to world hunger, given its impact on personal health and the environment, but intensive industrialised farming of soya, maize and grains comes at a significant carbon cost, too \u2013 as does flying in the ingredients to keep berries and nut butters on acai bowls or avocado on toast.</p> <p>Veganism, of course, is rooted in social justice \u2013 a detail that has faded from view as it has gone mainstream. But even in its dilute 21st-century form, veganism remains confrontational: it casts people\u2019s dietary choices in harsh relief, and people are by nature defensive. In countries where meat is prohibitively expensive for many, people are sometimes vegetarian or vegan by necessity; in the affluent west, not eating meat is an active choice. This makes it a rejection of a lifestyle and a rebuke to the majority\u2019s values \u2013 especially in a country (such as the UK) still struggling to escape the long shadow of rationing. We are conditioned to like animals and decry animal cruelty, and yet we are also brought up in a culture that revels in the bacon sandwich, the Sunday roast, fish and chips. One simple explanation for why people don\u2019t like vegans is because they show how confused humankind is about food choices and how illogical its decision-making can be.</p> <p>And yet none of this really gets to the heart of what it is about vegans that makes people so upset. Calling them humourless or militant, sanctimonious or annoying or hypocrites \u2013 all of these terms are just smokescreens for what it is that people really feel, which is fear. Vegans are unsettling and uncanny: they live among us, speak like us, behave like us \u2013 but for one significant exception. Meat may be murder, but to some people, the prospect of life without it is even worse.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>There is no justification for the amount of meat we eat in western society. The resources that go into humanely rearing and butchering an animal should make its flesh a borderline-unattainable luxury \u2013 and, indeed, in the past, it was. Meat always used to be the preserve of the wealthy, a symbol of prosperity: \u201cA chicken in every pot\u201d remained an aspirational but impractical promise across the best part of a millennium, from the days of Henry IV of France (when the term was invented) all the way through to Herbert Hoover\u2019s 1928 presidential campaign.</p> <p>It was only through the technological advances of modern agriculture that meat became attainable and available at supermarket prices. From the mid-1800s onwards, farmers could raise animals bigger, better and faster than in the past; kill them quicker; treat their flesh to prevent it from spoiling; transport it further and store it longer. A commonly cited psychological turning point was the second world war, which engendered what Russell Baker, writing in the New York Times, later described as a kind of \u201cbeef madness\u201d. GIs were sent to the front with rations of tinned meat; once peace had been declared, there was no better symbol of the brave new world than a sizzling celebratory steak. In the course of just over a century, meat went from unattainable luxury to dietary cornerstone; these days, we feel entitled to eat meat every day.</p> <p>In March this year, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was discussing the Green New Deal on Showtime\u2019s Desus &amp; Mero US TV talk show when she observed: \u201cMaybe we shouldn\u2019t be eating a hamburger for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Like, let\u2019s keep it real.\u201d An apparently innocuous comment, rooted in the same common-sense good science that informed the Lancet report on meat and environmental degradation published around the same time? Not if you asked the Republicans, it wasn\u2019t.</p> <p>Representative Rob Bishop of Utah seized on Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s comment, claiming that under the Green New Deal the eating of burgers would be \u201coutlawed\u201d. Former White House adviser Sebastian Gorka went one better, using a speech at the Conservative Political Action conference to proclaim: \u201cThey want to take away your hamburgers! This is what Stalin dreamed about but never achieved!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6f66e7dbe17670f76d93e5cafe6c4a93db97580d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f66e7dbe17670f76d93e5cafe6c4a93db97580d/0_200_4986_2993/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez announcing the Green New Deal, part of which would aim to reduce meat consumption.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez announcing the Green New Deal, part of which would aim to reduce meat consumption.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Stalin was, in fact, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/cpac-hamburgers-stalin-cortez-gorka-a8802646.html\" title=\"\">full of admiration</a> for the American burger, going so far as to send his minister of foreign trade to the US on a fact-finding mission (the result, the so-called Mikoyan cutlet, would remain an affordable Soviet staple for decades). But \u201cthey\u2019re taking our meat\u201d is as evocative a rallying cry as \u201cthey\u2019re taking our jobs\u201d or \u201cthey\u2019re taking our guns\u201d \u2013 it conveys the same sense of individual freedoms being menaced by external forces, a birthright under attack. Ted Cruz (wrongly) alleged that his Democrat rival Beto O\u2019Rourke planned to ban Texas barbecue if elected senator in his place: like the personal firearm, animal flesh has become an emblem of resistance against the encroachments of progressivism, something to be prised from your cold, dead hand. Men\u2019s rights advocate Jordan Peterson is famed for following a beef and salt diet; Donald Trump is renowned for his love of fast food and well-done steak with ketchup; there is even a subset of libertarian cryptocurrency enthusiasts who call themselves Bitcoin carnivores.</p> <p>In the internet age, the consumption of meat is visibly aligned with a certain kind of conservative alpha-masculinity. Before he found infamy eating raw flesh, Gatis Lagzdins was best known for hosting a YouTube channel peddling racist ideology and rightwing conspiracies about the Illuminati. Among the alt-right and affiliated circles online, the derogatory term \u201csoy boy\u201d has been adopted along with other terms such as \u201ccuck\u201d and \u201cbeta\u201d as a way of mocking so-called social justice warriors for their perceived lack of vigour. This echoes a finding in the MacInnis/Hodson study, in which respondents from a rightwing background, who seek to uphold traditional gender values, see something alarmingly subversive and worthy of derision in any man who prefers tofu to turkey.</p> <p>This loaded use of food-derived epithets cuts both ways. In the UK, the term \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/shortcuts/2018/may/14/is-it-offensive-to-call-ruddy-faced-middle-aged-tories-gammons\" title=\"\">gammon</a>\u201d gained currency in the early 2010s as a pejorative apparently inspired by the puce skin tone of enraged, middle-aged middle Englanders. Food has always been bound up in personal identity, and thus inextricable from politics. In their etymology, common terms such as \u201cdiet\u201d (Greek for way of life) and \u201cregime\u201d (Latin: rule) are metaphors for a struggle over what it means to lead one\u2019s life correctly. The very concept of orthorexia (whose sufferers obsessively exclude foods from their diet that they consider harmful) has at its root a corrupted idea of \u201ccorrect\u201d eating. It is impossible to talk about diets without also talking about the implied inadequacies of those who do not follow them; to paraphrase Brillat-Savarin, tell someone what to eat and you tell them who to be.</p> <p>The vegan conversation, then, is a stand-in for much bigger things. When we talk about veganism we are talking about environmental and social change; we are also contemplating the erasure of tradition (Texas barbecue! The Sunday roast! The sausage roll!). We are also tabling a long-overdue referendum on how our food choices affect us and the world around us. And as much as its popularity has been pumped up by concepts like flexitarianism, ultimately veganism\u2019s goal is a world in which the annual per-capita consumption of animal products is precisely zero. No wonder things have got so heated.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Food can be a powerful conduit for our anxieties, too. Half a century ago, a letter published in The New England Journal of Medicine described a terrifying new condition whose symptoms \u2013 headache, sweating, heart palpitations \u2013 were associated with a common ingredient of dishes served in Chinese restaurants: monosodium glutamate, or MSG. The flavour-enhancing additive was so demonised that it was banned in some US cities. Despite multiple studies conclusively proving otherwise, the belief in so-called \u201cChinese restaurant syndrome\u201d remains widespread today: Asian-American chefs still find themselves having to justify the use of MSG despite its widespread use in non-Asian foods too. It is a neat example of the persistence of food-related urban legends. There was no doubt a racist element to the way the MSG myth spread; those involved in its dissemination were also motivated by a gnawing fear of obsolescence as a new threat to their existence began to gain popularity.</p> <p>Those opposing meat-eating have a struggle ahead of them. It is clear that what is at stake here is not steak, but identity. A movement that preaches such wholesale change is bound to stir up anxieties, chief among them the sense that vegan dishes such as the Greggs Quorn sausage roll are being positioned not as alternatives but as replacements.</p> <p>With a few notable exceptions \u2013 most of them religious \u2013 meat has retained its primacy in cultures across the world. It originally became a status symbol because it was harder to obtain than plant matter \u2013 even a small animal could run away, and if caught, was capable of inflicting wounds that could prove fatal in a world before antibiotics. As society became hierarchical, there was no greater token of status than the ability to eat meat on a whim. In her 2016 book Meathooked, Marta Zaraska records the discovery of Egyptian tombs in which the pharaohs had been buried alongside \u201cmeat mummies\u201d, baskets of beef and poultry that had been embalmed in preparation for the afterlife. Our fetishisation of meat has not lessened \u2013 on the contrary, forecasters predict rapid increase in meat consumption in developing countries over the next decade. As a ready source of protein, meat remains the great aspiration, the surest proof of prosperity.</p> <p>As Carol J Adams wrote, the words we use shield us from the moral consequences of carnivory: we eat beef, not cows, pork, not pigs, while a cabbage remains just a cabbage wherever it is in its life cycle. Our language ennobles meat at the expense of veg: strong, muscular types are \u201cbeefy\u201d, lazy people are \u201ccouch potatoes\u201d, unresponsive ones \u201cvegetables\u201d. Turning our back on meat-eating is not as simple as changing from pork to Quorn: it requires us to reject some entrenched values.</p> <p>Already, there are signs that a great migration is underway. The UK university caterer Tuco recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/sep/22/vegan-college-menus-on-rise-as-students-return-to-universitys\" title=\"\">reported</a> that record numbers of canteens are going meat-free, describing the adoption of vegan or vegetarian diets among students and staff as a \u201cmega-trend\u201d. On the high street, too, there is a growing recognition that vegan ranges are not just opportunistic cash-grabs but potential best-sellers. After the success of Greggs\u2019 vegan sausage roll, Tesco announced it would be increasing its range of dedicated plant-based products by nearly 50% to keep pace with demand.</p> <p>Sales may be growing fast, but they are barely making a dent in the $1.7tr global market for animal-derived protein. Certainly, a change of culture will not happen without the involvement of government, industry and science; as the past few years have shown, widespread change is also unlikely to happen without a fight. This makes the current field of conflict an unfortunate one \u2013 in the real world, we can practise moderation, emotional flexitarianism. Online \u2013 where many of the vegan wars\u2019 most intense skirmishes are currently being fought \u2013 we do not find compromise or even look for it. The internet has made communication highly charged and polarised; the only way to be heard in such a screaming vortex is to shout louder.</p> <p>But the body of evidence suggesting that we eat too much meat is approaching the point where it becomes undeniable. This summer, a UN report <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/08/climate-crisis-reducing-lands-ability-to-sustain-humanity-says-ipcc\" title=\"\">identified</a> destruction of forests and emissions from cattle and other intensive farming practices as major factors driving the climate crisis towards a point of no return.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/jan/29/white-gold-the-unstoppable-rise-of-alternative-milks-oat-soy-rice-coconut-plant\">White gold: the unstoppable rise of alternative milks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some are proposing urgent action, such as the QC Michael Mansfield, who recently suggested (in a speech given at the launch of the Vegan Now campaign) that meat-eating could become illegal. He drew a parallel with the smoking ban, and it is indeed eminently possible that in time meat (especially red meat) becomes the new tobacco \u2013 a vice enjoyed by a small number of people in full awareness of its negative health consequences.</p> <p>But in coining the term \u201cecocide\u201d \u2013 and classing it as a crime against humanity \u2013 Mansfield framed the debate in different terms. We might portray the current moment as a precipice, and the growing interest in plant-based diets as the surest way back to safety. In this interpretation, the war on vegans is the act of a doomed majority fighting to defend its harmful way of life. Vegans might well be vociferous and annoying, holier-than-thou, self-satisfied and evangelical. But as their numbers grow beyond the margins, perhaps the worst thing they could be is right.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 29 October 2019 to clarify the brief summary of the 2015 study cited.

      "bodyText": "From the hunger strike to the edible projectile, history offers abundant examples of food being used for political ends. Even so, the crowd of vegans who gathered in central London earlier this year are unlikely to forget the moment when Gatis Lagzdins skinned and ate a raw squirrel. Along with his co-conspirator Deonisy Khlebnikov, Lagzdins performed his stunt at the weekly Soho Vegan Market on Rupert Street. He would subsequently demonstrate at VegFest in Brighton (although this time his snack of choice was a raw pig\u2019s head) as part of a self-proclaimed \u201ccarnivore tour\u201d intended to highlight the evils of a plant-based diet. At the London event, he wore a black vest emblazoned with the slogan: \u201cVeganism = Malnutrition.\u201d The war on vegans started small. There were flashpoints, some outrageous enough to receive press coverage. There was the episode in which William Sitwell, then editor of Waitrose magazine, resigned after a freelance writer leaked an email exchange in which he joked about \u201ckilling vegans one by one\u201d. (Sitwell has since apologised.) There was the PR nightmare faced by Natwest bank when a customer calling to apply for a loan was told by an employee that \u201call vegans should be punched in the face\u201d. When animal rights protesters stormed into a Brighton Pizza Express in September this year, one diner did exactly that. A charge commonly laid against vegans is that they relish their status as victims, but research suggests they have earned it. In 2015, a study conducted by Cara C MacInnis and Gordon Hodson and published in the journal Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations observed that vegetarians and vegans in western society \u2013 and vegans in particular \u2013 experience discrimination and bias on a par with other minorities. Once a niche interest group parodied in TV shows such as The Simpsons (in which a character describes himself as a \u201clevel five vegan\u201d who refuses to eat anything that casts a shadow), in the past two years, vegans have been thrust into the limelight. A philosophy rooted in non-aggression has found itself at the heart of some of the most virulent arguments on social media. In November 2018, Good Morning Britain hosted a debate titled \u201cDo people hate vegans?\u201d; the political website Vox tackled the question in even more direct fashion a week later, asking: \u201cWhy do people hate vegans so much?\u201d These recent displays of enmity towards vegans represent a puzzling escalation in hostilities, just as a consensus is starting to form that eating less meat would almost certainly be better for everyone \u2013 and the Earth. Of course, eating less meat does not mean eating no meat whatsoever, and the extreme prohibitions associated with going vegan (no animal products, no eggs, no leather, no wool) suggest it could have been just another Atkins diet or clean-eating fad \u2013 a flash in the pan that blows up and then dissipates, leaving behind nothing more than a dose of mild regret. Instead, just when the growth might have been expected to plateau, it kept on growing. A 2016 Ipsos Mori survey suggested the total number of vegans in the UK had increased more than 360% in the preceding decade, to more than 500,000. Big business has been quick to cash in. The Los Angeles-based company Beyond Meat, producer of plant-based burgers whose taste and texture are as much like minced beef as possible, recently went public and soon afterwards hit a valuation of $3.4bn; huge conglomerates such as Nestl\u00e9 and Kellogg\u2019s are moving into the fake-meat market; supermarkets and restaurant chains have introduced vegan ranges. Yet perhaps the definitive proof of veganism\u2019s mainstreaming \u2013 and the backlash against it \u2013 came in January this year, when the beloved high-street bakery chain Greggs announced it was launching a Quorn-based vegan sausage roll. It was pilloried by Piers Morgan, who tweeted: \u201cNobody was waiting for a vegan bloody sausage, you PC-ravaged clowns.\u201d It turns out Morgan was mistaken: the vegan sausage roll was such a hit that the company\u2019s share value leapt by 13%. Of course, what we grow, harvest, fatten and kill is political. A Tesco advert showcasing vegan produce met protests from the National Farmers Union who claimed it \u201cdemonised\u201d meat, while Shropshire deputy council leader Steve Charmley unleashed a tweet-storm when confronted with pro-vegan advertising in a county he claimed was \u201cbuilt on agriculture\u201d. This moment, and this conflict, were a long time coming. The rise of veganism is a question less of personal taste than of generational upheaval; less about meat and fish and dairy than the systems that put them on our tables in such excessive quantities. Ultimately, the vegan wars are not really about veganism at all, but about how individual freedom is coming into conflict with a personal and environmental health crisis. * * * In many cultures, the practice of abstaining entirely from animal produce has an established history: with their belief systems rooted in nonviolence, many Rastafarians, followers of Jainism and certain sects of Buddhism have been swearing off meat, fish, eggs and dairy for centuries. In large swathes of the west, though, public awareness of what veganism actually entails has been sketchy. There wasn\u2019t even a commonly accepted English-language name until 1944, when a British woodworker called Donald Watson called a meeting with a handful of other non-dairy vegetarians (including his wife, Dorothy) to discuss a less cumbersome label for their lifestyle. They considered alternatives such as dairyban, vitan and benevore before settling on the term we use today, a simple contraction of vegetarian on the grounds that \u201cveganism starts with vegetarianism and carries it through to its logical conclusions\u201d. But those logical conclusions did not stop at abstaining from certain foods. The original vegans were not pursuing a diet so much as a belief system, a wholesale ideology \u2013 one that rejected not just animal protein but also the way animals had become part of an industrial supply chain. In the 1970s, Carol J Adams started work on the book that would appear, two decades later, as The Sexual Politics of Meat: a seminal feminist text that positioned veganism as the only logical solution to a social system that reduced both women and animals to desirable, but disposable, flesh. In the early 70s, other activists were considering how veganism might provide a viable alternative to existing food systems. In 1971, Diet for a Small Planet by the social policy activist Frances Moore Lapp\u00e9 introduced an environmental justification for going vegetarian or vegan to a global audience (it eventually sold more than 3m copies). In the same year, counter-culture hero Stephen Gaskin founded a vegan intentional community, The Farm, in Lewis County, Tennessee, bringing together some 300 like-minded individuals. Four years later, The Farm Vegetarian Cookbook by Louise Hagler announced: \u201cWe are vegetarians because one-third of the world is starving and at least half goes to bed hungry every night,\u201d and introduced western audiences to techniques for making their own soy-based products such as tofu and tempeh. The Farm Vegetarian Cookbook fixed a certain vegan aesthetic in the minds of mainstream meat-eating culture for decades to come. Veganism became synonymous with soybeans and brown rice, with ageing hippies spooning beige bowlfuls of worthy grains and pulses \u2013 not the glamorous, vibrant, youthful practitioners that now radiate positivity from their Instagram feeds. It is hard to overstate the role social media has played in transforming veganism\u2019s image, with its facility for fostering an instant sense of community. Witness any number of viral internet phenomena \u2013 from Woman Laughing Alone with Salad to acai bowls and this generation\u2019s staple, avocado toast \u2013 that have helped free it from its musty old associations. Instagram in particular gave vegan food mainstream exposure, repackaging it (good for you and photogenic!) for the low-attention-span internet age. Not everyone sees this as a positive development: the vegan writer and podcast host Alicia Kennedy considers it troubling that the internet has transformed something with such a rich political history into \u201ca wellness thing\u201d that allows would-be consumers to label themselves vegans without having to engage with the \u201cexcess baggage\u201d of ideology. Another American writer, Khushbu Shah, has argued that the popularisation of veganism via social media has erased non-white faces and narratives from the dominant discourse, as white bloggers and influencers fashion a lifestyle in their image. At the same time, a similar transformation was happening to the food vegans were eating. A blossoming street food scene in major cities influenced a dirtier, trashier vegan aesthetic that gave the diet a further boost. Recipe channels on YouTube and Facebook such as BOSH! \u2013 a glossy young male duo \u2013 used video to make stunt dishes (apple pie tacos; a plant-based take on a McDonald\u2019s McMuffin; a watermelon \u201cJaegerbomb\u201d) that injected some much-needed fun into the diet. (Tellingly, the BOSH! dudes, Henry Firth and Ian Theasby, refer to themselves not as chefs but \u201cfood remixers\u201d.) The language began to reflect a new, more approachable veganism. Descriptors such as \u201cplant-based\u201d gained in popularity, effectively rebranding the worthy brown stodge of popular imagination into something green and vital. Other neologisms such as \u201cflexitarian\u201d (a term denoting someone who is predominantly vegan or vegetarian but who occasionally eats meat or fish, added to the Oxford English Dictionary in June 2014) recast daunting vegan ideology as a fun, healthy, casual thing to try. Cultish initiatives like Veganuary (an annual campaign encouraging people to go meat-free for the first month of the year, launched in 2014) and Meat Free Mondays tapped into this spirit \u2013 moving away from wholesale dietary transformation and towards something more manageably sporadic, with the added gloss of being able to share (that is, brag about) the experience online. Beyonc\u00e9 declared an interest in veganism \u2013 at least, for breakfast \u2013 while athletes such as Venus Williams (who took up a raw vegan diet to combat a health condition) and Lewis Hamilton played a vital role in raising awareness and turning something once seen as weird and a little annoying into a desirable lifestyle. Helping the cause was the growing body of scientific literature suggesting that some of the processes that produce the modern western diet were catastrophically bad for us. Bee Wilson wrote in these pages about the health effects of processed pork in a piece titled \u201cYes, bacon really is killing us.\u201d Food in the Anthropocene, a report commissioned by the Lancet in conjunction with the global nonprofit Eat (a startup dedicated to transforming the global food system) concluded that \u201cunhealthy diets are the largest global burden of disease\u201d, and that meat-heavy food production is \u201cthe largest source of environmental degradation\u201d. A major study led by a team from Oxford University, published in the journal Nature in October 2018, showed that huge reductions in meat-eating are essential to slow the rate of climate change. Livestock production has been shown to lead to dangerous levels of deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions. Factor in pop-science phenomena like the documentaries Cowspiracy! and What the Health \u2013 available on Netflix \u2013 and your diet suddenly seemed like a way you could save the world. Big Meat continues to lobby aggressively in favour of our God-given right to eat animal flesh, resulting in a series of legal prohibitions surrounding what can and cannot be called \u201cmeat\u201d\u2019 or even \u2013 in one US state \u2013 a \u201cveggie burger\u201d. But veganism\u2019s virality has proved irresistible. From about 2015, vegan and plant-based cookery manuals started to proliferate at a dazzling rate, with the BOSH! boys selling upward of 80,000 copies and spending four weeks on the Sunday Times bestseller list (today, Amazon lists more than 20,000 results for the search term \u201cvegan cookbook\u201d). Sales of plant milks skyrocketed; financial results at the manufacturer of plant-based protein Quorn soared as what one analyst referred to as the \u201cbattle for the centre of the plate\u201d began to draw (fake) blood. By 2018, Byron, M&amp;S and Pret had invested heavily in vegan ranges. It was, this paper proclaimed, \u201cthe year that veganism moved out of the realms of counter-culture and into the mainstream\u201d. In 2014, Veganuary\u2019s inaugural campaign had attracted just 3,300 participants; by 2019 the number was greater than 250,000, with 53% of them under the age of 35. But veganism\u2019s explosive growth alone does not explain why it attracted such controversy. There is something inherent to veganism and vegans that arouses deeper feelings. What is it about the vegan lifestyle that stirs such strong emotion in those who don\u2019t happen to share it? Why do people hate vegans so much? * * * Early attempts to establish a vegan utopia did not go well. In the 1840s, the transcendentalist philosopher Amos Bronson Alcott (father of the author of Little Women, Louisa May) founded Fruitlands in Harvard, Massachusetts \u2013 a vegan community intended to be nothing less than a second Eden. But Alcott\u2019s insistence that crops had to be planted and fields tilled by hand meant that not enough food could be grown for all of the members (even though the population peaked at just 13); a diet of fruit and grains, typically consumed raw, left participants severely malnourished. Just seven months after opening, Fruitlands closed \u2013 derided, in the words of one biographer, as \u201cone of history\u2019s most unsuccessful utopias\u201d. The timing was unfortunate for American vegetarians, who were already engaged in a pitched battle with public opinion. Vegetarians and vegans in the 19th century \u2013 known as Grahamites after the Presbyterian minister and diet reformer Sylvester Graham, who campaigned against meat-eating on the grounds that it was both unhealthy and morally repugnant \u2013 were the subject of frequent vitriolic editorials in the popular and medical press of the day, which described them as \u201ccadaverous\u201d, \u201cfeeble\u201d, \u201chalf-crazed\u201d, \u201csour-visaged\u201d and \u201cfood cranks\u201d. In the 21st century the terminology may have changed but the sentiment remains much the same. The 2015 study conducted by MacInnis and Hodson found that only drug addicts were viewed more negatively among respondents. It concluded: \u201cUnlike other forms of bias (eg, racism, sexism), negativity toward vegetarians and vegans is not widely considered a societal problem; rather, [it] is commonplace and largely accepted.\u201d In 2011, sociologists Matthew Cole and Karen Morgan observed a phenomenon they called \u201cvegaphobia\u201d, demonstrating that the British media consistently portrayed vegans in a negative light. In the days after her story broke, Selene Nelson, the freelancer at the centre of the Waitrose magazine row, was called \u201chumourless\u201d, \u201ccombative\u201d and \u201cmilitant\u201d. In 2017, residents of the Swiss town of Aargau reportedly called for a vegan foreign resident to be denied citizenship because she was \u201cannoying\u201d, and the glee with which the global media retold the story revealed a widespread and casual prejudice. Veganism\u2019s opponents outline a host of objections to the lifestyle to justify their hostility. Per a now-familiar joke (Q: How do you know if someone\u2019s vegan? A: Don\u2019t worry, they\u2019ll tell you), vegans are portrayed as preachy and sanctimonious, a characteristic that rankled among MacInnis and Hodson\u2019s respondents in particular, who viewed \u201cvegetarians/vegans more negatively when their motivations concern social justice rather than personal health\u201d. There are rational motives to oppose vegan diets on health grounds. They can be deficient in crucial nutrients such as vitamin B-12. This is especially notable in the case of extreme diets (such as fruitarianism) advocated by some vegan bloggers or Instagram influencers with unorthodox approaches to nutritional science. Various supermarket chains have also attempted to meet the burgeoning demand for vegan products with highly processed vegan ready meals \u2013 from the Impossible Burger to plant-based meatballs, goujons and hot dogs. As Bee Wilson argued in these pages, the high proportion of processed ingredients in these products means the so-called health halo they enjoy may well be illusory. Perhaps all we are doing, as veganism truly goes mainstream and companies such as Beyond Meat reap windfalls, is replacing one kind of industrialised system with another. Evidence suggests that intensive livestock farming is a poor solution to world hunger, given its impact on personal health and the environment, but intensive industrialised farming of soya, maize and grains comes at a significant carbon cost, too \u2013 as does flying in the ingredients to keep berries and nut butters on acai bowls or avocado on toast. Veganism, of course, is rooted in social justice \u2013 a detail that has faded from view as it has gone mainstream. But even in its dilute 21st-century form, veganism remains confrontational: it casts people\u2019s dietary choices in harsh relief, and people are by nature defensive. In countries where meat is prohibitively expensive for many, people are sometimes vegetarian or vegan by necessity; in the affluent west, not eating meat is an active choice. This makes it a rejection of a lifestyle and a rebuke to the majority\u2019s values \u2013 especially in a country (such as the UK) still struggling to escape the long shadow of rationing. We are conditioned to like animals and decry animal cruelty, and yet we are also brought up in a culture that revels in the bacon sandwich, the Sunday roast, fish and chips. One simple explanation for why people don\u2019t like vegans is because they show how confused humankind is about food choices and how illogical its decision-making can be. And yet none of this really gets to the heart of what it is about vegans that makes people so upset. Calling them humourless or militant, sanctimonious or annoying or hypocrites \u2013 all of these terms are just smokescreens for what it is that people really feel, which is fear. Vegans are unsettling and uncanny: they live among us, speak like us, behave like us \u2013 but for one significant exception. Meat may be murder, but to some people, the prospect of life without it is even worse. * * * There is no justification for the amount of meat we eat in western society. The resources that go into humanely rearing and butchering an animal should make its flesh a borderline-unattainable luxury \u2013 and, indeed, in the past, it was. Meat always used to be the preserve of the wealthy, a symbol of prosperity: \u201cA chicken in every pot\u201d remained an aspirational but impractical promise across the best part of a millennium, from the days of Henry IV of France (when the term was invented) all the way through to Herbert Hoover\u2019s 1928 presidential campaign. It was only through the technological advances of modern agriculture that meat became attainable and available at supermarket prices. From the mid-1800s onwards, farmers could raise animals bigger, better and faster than in the past; kill them quicker; treat their flesh to prevent it from spoiling; transport it further and store it longer. A commonly cited psychological turning point was the second world war, which engendered what Russell Baker, writing in the New York Times, later described as a kind of \u201cbeef madness\u201d. GIs were sent to the front with rations of tinned meat; once peace had been declared, there was no better symbol of the brave new world than a sizzling celebratory steak. In the course of just over a century, meat went from unattainable luxury to dietary cornerstone; these days, we feel entitled to eat meat every day. In March this year, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was discussing the Green New Deal on Showtime\u2019s Desus &amp; Mero US TV talk show when she observed: \u201cMaybe we shouldn\u2019t be eating a hamburger for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Like, let\u2019s keep it real.\u201d An apparently innocuous comment, rooted in the same common-sense good science that informed the Lancet report on meat and environmental degradation published around the same time? Not if you asked the Republicans, it wasn\u2019t. Representative Rob Bishop of Utah seized on Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s comment, claiming that under the Green New Deal the eating of burgers would be \u201coutlawed\u201d. Former White House adviser Sebastian Gorka went one better, using a speech at the Conservative Political Action conference to proclaim: \u201cThey want to take away your hamburgers! This is what Stalin dreamed about but never achieved!\u201d Stalin was, in fact, full of admiration for the American burger, going so far as to send his minister of foreign trade to the US on a fact-finding mission (the result, the so-called Mikoyan cutlet, would remain an affordable Soviet staple for decades). But \u201cthey\u2019re taking our meat\u201d is as evocative a rallying cry as \u201cthey\u2019re taking our jobs\u201d or \u201cthey\u2019re taking our guns\u201d \u2013 it conveys the same sense of individual freedoms being menaced by external forces, a birthright under attack. Ted Cruz (wrongly) alleged that his Democrat rival Beto O\u2019Rourke planned to ban Texas barbecue if elected senator in his place: like the personal firearm, animal flesh has become an emblem of resistance against the encroachments of progressivism, something to be prised from your cold, dead hand. Men\u2019s rights advocate Jordan Peterson is famed for following a beef and salt diet; Donald Trump is renowned for his love of fast food and well-done steak with ketchup; there is even a subset of libertarian cryptocurrency enthusiasts who call themselves Bitcoin carnivores. In the internet age, the consumption of meat is visibly aligned with a certain kind of conservative alpha-masculinity. Before he found infamy eating raw flesh, Gatis Lagzdins was best known for hosting a YouTube channel peddling racist ideology and rightwing conspiracies about the Illuminati. Among the alt-right and affiliated circles online, the derogatory term \u201csoy boy\u201d has been adopted along with other terms such as \u201ccuck\u201d and \u201cbeta\u201d as a way of mocking so-called social justice warriors for their perceived lack of vigour. This echoes a finding in the MacInnis/Hodson study, in which respondents from a rightwing background, who seek to uphold traditional gender values, see something alarmingly subversive and worthy of derision in any man who prefers tofu to turkey. This loaded use of food-derived epithets cuts both ways. In the UK, the term \u201cgammon\u201d gained currency in the early 2010s as a pejorative apparently inspired by the puce skin tone of enraged, middle-aged middle Englanders. Food has always been bound up in personal identity, and thus inextricable from politics. In their etymology, common terms such as \u201cdiet\u201d (Greek for way of life) and \u201cregime\u201d (Latin: rule) are metaphors for a struggle over what it means to lead one\u2019s life correctly. The very concept of orthorexia (whose sufferers obsessively exclude foods from their diet that they consider harmful) has at its root a corrupted idea of \u201ccorrect\u201d eating. It is impossible to talk about diets without also talking about the implied inadequacies of those who do not follow them; to paraphrase Brillat-Savarin, tell someone what to eat and you tell them who to be. The vegan conversation, then, is a stand-in for much bigger things. When we talk about veganism we are talking about environmental and social change; we are also contemplating the erasure of tradition (Texas barbecue! The Sunday roast! The sausage roll!). We are also tabling a long-overdue referendum on how our food choices affect us and the world around us. And as much as its popularity has been pumped up by concepts like flexitarianism, ultimately veganism\u2019s goal is a world in which the annual per-capita consumption of animal products is precisely zero. No wonder things have got so heated. * * * Food can be a powerful conduit for our anxieties, too. Half a century ago, a letter published in The New England Journal of Medicine described a terrifying new condition whose symptoms \u2013 headache, sweating, heart palpitations \u2013 were associated with a common ingredient of dishes served in Chinese restaurants: monosodium glutamate, or MSG. The flavour-enhancing additive was so demonised that it was banned in some US cities. Despite multiple studies conclusively proving otherwise, the belief in so-called \u201cChinese restaurant syndrome\u201d remains widespread today: Asian-American chefs still find themselves having to justify the use of MSG despite its widespread use in non-Asian foods too. It is a neat example of the persistence of food-related urban legends. There was no doubt a racist element to the way the MSG myth spread; those involved in its dissemination were also motivated by a gnawing fear of obsolescence as a new threat to their existence began to gain popularity. Those opposing meat-eating have a struggle ahead of them. It is clear that what is at stake here is not steak, but identity. A movement that preaches such wholesale change is bound to stir up anxieties, chief among them the sense that vegan dishes such as the Greggs Quorn sausage roll are being positioned not as alternatives but as replacements. With a few notable exceptions \u2013 most of them religious \u2013 meat has retained its primacy in cultures across the world. It originally became a status symbol because it was harder to obtain than plant matter \u2013 even a small animal could run away, and if caught, was capable of inflicting wounds that could prove fatal in a world before antibiotics. As society became hierarchical, there was no greater token of status than the ability to eat meat on a whim. In her 2016 book Meathooked, Marta Zaraska records the discovery of Egyptian tombs in which the pharaohs had been buried alongside \u201cmeat mummies\u201d, baskets of beef and poultry that had been embalmed in preparation for the afterlife. Our fetishisation of meat has not lessened \u2013 on the contrary, forecasters predict rapid increase in meat consumption in developing countries over the next decade. As a ready source of protein, meat remains the great aspiration, the surest proof of prosperity. As Carol J Adams wrote, the words we use shield us from the moral consequences of carnivory: we eat beef, not cows, pork, not pigs, while a cabbage remains just a cabbage wherever it is in its life cycle. Our language ennobles meat at the expense of veg: strong, muscular types are \u201cbeefy\u201d, lazy people are \u201ccouch potatoes\u201d, unresponsive ones \u201cvegetables\u201d. Turning our back on meat-eating is not as simple as changing from pork to Quorn: it requires us to reject some entrenched values. Already, there are signs that a great migration is underway. The UK university caterer Tuco recently reported that record numbers of canteens are going meat-free, describing the adoption of vegan or vegetarian diets among students and staff as a \u201cmega-trend\u201d. On the high street, too, there is a growing recognition that vegan ranges are not just opportunistic cash-grabs but potential best-sellers. After the success of Greggs\u2019 vegan sausage roll, Tesco announced it would be increasing its range of dedicated plant-based products by nearly 50% to keep pace with demand. Sales may be growing fast, but they are barely making a dent in the $1.7tr global market for animal-derived protein. Certainly, a change of culture will not happen without the involvement of government, industry and science; as the past few years have shown, widespread change is also unlikely to happen without a fight. This makes the current field of conflict an unfortunate one \u2013 in the real world, we can practise moderation, emotional flexitarianism. Online \u2013 where many of the vegan wars\u2019 most intense skirmishes are currently being fought \u2013 we do not find compromise or even look for it. The internet has made communication highly charged and polarised; the only way to be heard in such a screaming vortex is to shout louder. But the body of evidence suggesting that we eat too much meat is approaching the point where it becomes undeniable. This summer, a UN report identified destruction of forests and emissions from cattle and other intensive farming practices as major factors driving the climate crisis towards a point of no return. Some are proposing urgent action, such as the QC Michael Mansfield, who recently suggested (in a speech given at the launch of the Vegan Now campaign) that meat-eating could become illegal. He drew a parallel with the smoking ban, and it is indeed eminently possible that in time meat (especially red meat) becomes the new tobacco \u2013 a vice enjoyed by a small number of people in full awareness of its negative health consequences. But in coining the term \u201cecocide\u201d \u2013 and classing it as a crime against humanity \u2013 Mansfield framed the debate in different terms. We might portray the current moment as a precipice, and the growing interest in plant-based diets as the surest way back to safety. In this interpretation, the war on vegans is the act of a doomed majority fighting to defend its harmful way of life. Vegans might well be vociferous and annoying, holier-than-thou, self-satisfied and evangelical. But as their numbers grow beyond the margins, perhaps the worst thing they could be is right. \u2022 This article was amended on 29 October 2019 to clarify the brief summary of the 2015 study cited. The study reported that vegetarians, and especially vegans, experienced bias and discrimination on a par with other minorities, but did not describe those minorities as ethnic and religious. \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here",

      "body": "<p>Even in a completely empty theatre, Max Martin manages to disappear, choosing to perch himself on the back row, almost completely hidden in shadow. If you didn\u2019t know whom you were looking for, you would assume the long-haired, 48-year-old Swede, dressed in a black T-shirt, was taking a break from shifting props for that night\u2019s performance of the new jukebox musical <a href=\"https://www.andjulietthemusical.co.uk/\" title=\"\">&amp; Juliet</a>.</p> <p>It seems inconceivable that someone so unassuming could have dominated pop music for more than 20 years, but the statistics speak for themselves. Martin has co-written and co-produced 73 US Top 10 singles for the likes of Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande, Katy Perry and Britney Spears. Twenty-two went to No 1, with 12 also topping the UK charts. Collectively, these have sold more than 150m copies globally, earning Martin an Oscar nomination, five Grammys and the 2016 Polar Music prize (previously won by Bob Dylan and Patti Smith). Martin\u2019s 22 US No 1s make him the third-most successful songwriter in US chart history, behind only Paul McCartney (32) and John Lennon (26).</p> <p>He is the man who introduced the imperishable, if occasionally linguistically questionable, choruses \u201cHit me baby one more time\u201d, \u201cI kissed a girl and I liked it\u201d and \u201cBackstreet\u2019s back, all right!\u201d to karaoke booths everywhere, with songs that were at once dramatic, melancholic and never less than relentlessly catchy. The hugely ambitious &amp; Juliet \u2013 a modern re-telling of Shakespeare\u2019s Romeo &amp; Juliet in which Juliet decides not to kill herself , but to head to Paris in order to live a little \u2013 is woven expertly around 30 of these hits, originally written for artists ranging from Celine Dion to \u2018NSync, the Weeknd to Pink.</p> <p>Martin hardly ever gives interviews. \u201cI\u2019m not a shy person,\u201d he clarifies as we sit in one of Manchester Opera House\u2019s tiny bars, his accent a mix of Swedish and the Los Angeles drawl of his adopted home. \u201cI just like to stay in the background as much as possible.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When I heard Britney singing I just knew instantly.

If you have done it all, your songs turning Swift, Perry and Grande into superstars, where do you go next? \u201cThere was so much for me to learn here,\u201d he smiles. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to go on autopilot. If I\u2019m feeling uncomfortable then that\u2019s probably where I should be, rather than in a place where I\u2019m like: \u2018I totally got this.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The foundations for Martin\u2019s empire were laid during an apprenticeship with <a href=\"https://slate.com/culture/2015/10/denniz-pop-max-martin-and-cheiron-studios-the-man-who-invented-modern-pop.html\" title=\"\">Denniz PoP</a>, whose 90s productions for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCansLl8T6imFHqOhfXoAHmg\" title=\"\">Ace of Base</a> had become international hits. Martin (born Karl Martin Sandberg in Stockholm) had played the French horn at school; when he met PoP (born Dag Krister Volle) he was the frontman of It\u2019s Alive, a Kiss-inspired glam rock band. Discerning that Sandberg had an ear for pop music, PoP \u2013 a fan of pseudonyms \u2013 rechristened him Max Martin and employed him as a songwriter and producer at his Stockholm powerhouse, <a href=\"https://www.cheironmusic.com/cheiron-studios.html\" title=\"\">Cheiron</a> studios. Cheiron\u2019s records would fuse R&amp;B grooves with happy/sad Abba-esque melodies. The former glam rocker Martin brought an edge of bombast and some weapons-grade melodies, soon employed on records for the Backstreet Boys and the British boyband Five.</p> <p>PoP died of cancer in August 1998, two months before the release of what may be Martin\u2019s most famous creation. ... Baby One More Time, which he wrote singlehandedly, got to No 1 in just about every country it was released. But it almost came to nothing. The demo, Martin remembers, sat lying around for \u201cmaybe six months, a year\u201d and attempts were made to pitch it to \u201creally established artists\u201d. Eventually the Backstreet Boys\u2019 label, Jive, offered it to their new signing, Spears. \u201cWhen I heard her singing, I just knew instantly,\u201d he says. \u201cThe way she recorded that song, she added another dimension.\u201d</p> <p>Among the artists who turned it down were TLC, assuming that the line \u201cHit me baby one more time\u201d advocated domestic violence. Martin and his fellow Swedes at Cheiron had meant it simply as slang for \u201ccall me\u201d. Other Martin lyrics of the era also presented problems for West Read when he was weaving them into &amp; Juliet. \u201cIt\u2019s really kind of confusing,\u201d he says of the Backstreet Boys\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fndeDfaWCg\" title=\"\">I Want it That Way</a>, a song that seems to undermine itself at every turn.</p> <p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s a thing, right?\u201d Martin beams proudly. \u201cLike: \u2018What does it mean?\u2019 There were forums of people discussing it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"310c8397b3ce00f3de0d07fdd3487431a3780891\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/310c8397b3ce00f3de0d07fdd3487431a3780891/0_239_2385_2435/979.jpg\" alt=\"Max Martin and Britney Sears\" width=\"979\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One more time \u2026 Max Martin and Britney Spears in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lester Cohen/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While the grammatical error that appears in Ariana Grande\u2019s 2014 EDM stomper Break Free (\u201cNow that I\u2019ve become who I really are\u201d) may have been placed there on purpose \u2013 including a \u201cjuicy line\u201d that sticks in the listener\u2019s memory is a very Max Martin move \u2013 the Backstreet Boys song is a clearer example of Martin\u2019s obsession with words serving the melody, a concept he calls \u201cmelodic math\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cGrowing up, I listened to songs by Abba, Elton John, the Beatles, and I had no idea what they meant, so to me phonetics have always been important,\u201d he explains. \u201cI felt something hearing this music, and it meant something to me. If you can have a great lyric that also phonetically sounds amazing, then you\u2019re golden. But it\u2019s also kind of cool if you write a song and people are emotionally moved without understanding what\u2019s being said. That, to me, is as powerful.\u201d</p> <p>He favours simplicity, repetition and instant familiarity over unnecessary complexity, but balks at the idea that his songwriting is governed by strict rules. \u201cIt\u2019s about having tools for when you\u2019re stuck,\u201d he says, leaning in as if divulging a secret. \u201cIf you have a verse that\u2019s super-busy, and you want to take it to the next part, you might want something that has a little more space, so [the listener] can take in the information and not get lost.\u201d</p> <p>You can hear this technique on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfWlot6h_JM\" title=\"\">Taylor Swift\u2019s Shake It Off</a>, for example. \u201cThat\u2019s a mathematical way of thinking, it\u2019s not about doing it by feel,\u201d he concedes. \u201cBut if it\u2019s flowing, you don\u2019t need any of that stuff.\u201d He thinks for a moment. \u201cAlso, if there was a hard rule then all of my songs would be huge and, trust me, they\u2019re not.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019ve seen it many many times, what fame does.

And then we watch their lives fall apart in front of our eyes for doing something amazing.\u201d</p> <p>He sighs. \u201cI\u2019m so thankful that someone actually still wants that job. I\u2019ve seen it many many times, what fame does. And it goes back to why I don\u2019t do interviews. Especially now with social media: our lives are on display all the time and when you\u2019re famous it\u2019s on a whole other level. We\u2019re not made to be that famous, it\u2019s not normal. It\u2019s not in our DNA.\u201d</p> <p>His more recent work with the likes of <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/normani-motivatino-mtv-video-music-awards-875604/\" title=\"\">Normani</a> and <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/how-ariana-grande-and-max-martin-made-problem-the-song-of-the-summer-85685/\" title=\"\">Grande</a> have seen him embrace the fact that pop\u2019s pendulum has swung away from pop and towards R&amp;B and hip-hop, a shift that \u2013 when it happened in the early 00s with the rise of Pharrell Williams\u2019s songwriting and production outfit <a href=\"https://www.factmag.com/2011/09/13/the-essential-neptunes/\" title=\"\">the Neptunes</a> \u2013 briefly knocked Martin off course. Does he have similar concerns this time?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve come to a point where I try not to think about the perception of the work,\u201d he says. \u201cThe first time it happened, when the boyband era crashed in front of my eyes, I was freaking out a bit, but I\u2019ve never really been worried.\u201d That LA breeziness returns. \u201cI\u2019m not [making music] because I want to be successful; I would be doing this anyway. Also, popular culture is supposed to move.\u201d Making records, he says, is \u201cabout staying inspired, but also sticking to your guns of what you love doing\u201d.</p> <p>Suddenly, the musical\u2019s in-house band starts up next door, a sign that Martin is free to stop doing something he is still learning to love. As we get up to leave, we are joined by a PR who needs to speak to Martin about that evening\u2019s opening press night. One-sided discussions are had about red carpets, photographers and local press, with Martin looking increasingly nervous. \u201cI can still arrive via the side door right?\u201d he says, edging back into the shadows.</p> <p><em>&amp; Juliet transfers to the Shaftesbury Theatre, London on 2 November.

      "bodyText": "Even in a completely empty theatre, Max Martin manages to disappear, choosing to perch himself on the back row, almost completely hidden in shadow. If you didn\u2019t know whom you were looking for, you would assume the long-haired, 48-year-old Swede, dressed in a black T-shirt, was taking a break from shifting props for that night\u2019s performance of the new jukebox musical &amp; Juliet. It seems inconceivable that someone so unassuming could have dominated pop music for more than 20 years, but the statistics speak for themselves. Martin has co-written and co-produced 73 US Top 10 singles for the likes of Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande, Katy Perry and Britney Spears. Twenty-two went to No 1, with 12 also topping the UK charts. Collectively, these have sold more than 150m copies globally, earning Martin an Oscar nomination, five Grammys and the 2016 Polar Music prize (previously won by Bob Dylan and Patti Smith). Martin\u2019s 22 US No 1s make him the third-most successful songwriter in US chart history, behind only Paul McCartney (32) and John Lennon (26). He is the man who introduced the imperishable, if occasionally linguistically questionable, choruses \u201cHit me baby one more time\u201d, \u201cI kissed a girl and I liked it\u201d and \u201cBackstreet\u2019s back, all right!\u201d to karaoke booths everywhere, with songs that were at once dramatic, melancholic and never less than relentlessly catchy. The hugely ambitious &amp; Juliet \u2013 a modern re-telling of Shakespeare\u2019s Romeo &amp; Juliet in which Juliet decides not to kill herself , but to head to Paris in order to live a little \u2013 is woven expertly around 30 of these hits, originally written for artists ranging from Celine Dion to \u2018NSync, the Weeknd to Pink. Martin hardly ever gives interviews. \u201cI\u2019m not a shy person,\u201d he clarifies as we sit in one of Manchester Opera House\u2019s tiny bars, his accent a mix of Swedish and the Los Angeles drawl of his adopted home. \u201cI just like to stay in the background as much as possible.\u201d Ever since he earned his first US Top 10 hit in 1997 by co-writing and co-producing fellow Swede Robyn\u2019s Do You Know (What It Takes), Martin has been a self-confessed \u201cstudio nerd tucked away in a basement somewhere\u201d. One rock star due to get the Max treatment assumed the quiet man he had met was an engineer and asked him when Martin was due to arrive. We are joined by the writer of &amp; Juliet\u2019s book, David West Read, who, much to Martin\u2019s delight, has shown up in a vintage Britney T-shirt. \u201cYou\u2019re about to find out I love talking,\u201d Martin continues, popping a snus (a moist tobacco bag, popular in Sweden) under his top lip. \u201cWe\u2019ve been putting a lot of work into &amp; Juliet and it\u2019s a new field for me, so I don\u2019t mind talking about this.\u201d Martin had been toying with the idea of a jukebox musical for years, inspired by Abba\u2019s global behemoth, Mamma Mia! If a feminist retelling of a Shakespeare soundtracked by Spears sounds like the work of someone who has just had a bump to the head, well, that is because it is. \u201cI had hit my head on a kitchen cabinet and couldn\u2019t look at screens or light for a while,\u201d West Read says (he was concussed). \u201cSo I made a playlist of Max\u2019s catalogue and realised that so many of the songs are about young love \u2026 of course Romeo &amp; Juliet came to mind.\u201d As well as getting involved in the auditions and workshops, Martin also recorded the cast album. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be like: \u2018Oh, just do it,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of the songs were written with the artists and co-writers, and so I feel responsible for all these people that have been involved throughout my career.\u201d It also represented something that has perhaps been missing from his, as he calls it, \u201cday job\u201d: risk. If you have done it all, your songs turning Swift, Perry and Grande into superstars, where do you go next? \u201cThere was so much for me to learn here,\u201d he smiles. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to go on autopilot. If I\u2019m feeling uncomfortable then that\u2019s probably where I should be, rather than in a place where I\u2019m like: \u2018I totally got this.\u2019\u201d The foundations for Martin\u2019s empire were laid during an apprenticeship with Denniz PoP, whose 90s productions for Ace of Base had become international hits. Martin (born Karl Martin Sandberg in Stockholm) had played the French horn at school; when he met PoP (born Dag Krister Volle) he was the frontman of It\u2019s Alive, a Kiss-inspired glam rock band. Discerning that Sandberg had an ear for pop music, PoP \u2013 a fan of pseudonyms \u2013 rechristened him Max Martin and employed him as a songwriter and producer at his Stockholm powerhouse, Cheiron studios. Cheiron\u2019s records would fuse R&amp;B grooves with happy/sad Abba-esque melodies. The former glam rocker Martin brought an edge of bombast and some weapons-grade melodies, soon employed on records for the Backstreet Boys and the British boyband Five. PoP died of cancer in August 1998, two months before the release of what may be Martin\u2019s most famous creation. ... Baby One More Time, which he wrote singlehandedly, got to No 1 in just about every country it was released. But it almost came to nothing. The demo, Martin remembers, sat lying around for \u201cmaybe six months, a year\u201d and attempts were made to pitch it to \u201creally established artists\u201d. Eventually the Backstreet Boys\u2019 label, Jive, offered it to their new signing, Spears. \u201cWhen I heard her singing, I just knew instantly,\u201d he says. \u201cThe way she recorded that song, she added another dimension.\u201d Among the artists who turned it down were TLC, assuming that the line \u201cHit me baby one more time\u201d advocated domestic violence. Martin and his fellow Swedes at Cheiron had meant it simply as slang for \u201ccall me\u201d. Other Martin lyrics of the era also presented problems for West Read when he was weaving them into &amp; Juliet. \u201cIt\u2019s really kind of confusing,\u201d he says of the Backstreet Boys\u2019 I Want it That Way, a song that seems to undermine itself at every turn. \u201cYou know that\u2019s a thing, right?\u201d Martin beams proudly. \u201cLike: \u2018What does it mean?\u2019 There were forums of people discussing it.\u201d While the grammatical error that appears in Ariana Grande\u2019s 2014 EDM stomper Break Free (\u201cNow that I\u2019ve become who I really are\u201d) may have been placed there on purpose \u2013 including a \u201cjuicy line\u201d that sticks in the listener\u2019s memory is a very Max Martin move \u2013 the Backstreet Boys song is a clearer example of Martin\u2019s obsession with words serving the melody, a concept he calls \u201cmelodic math\u201d. \u201cGrowing up, I listened to songs by Abba, Elton John, the Beatles, and I had no idea what they meant, so to me phonetics have always been important,\u201d he explains. \u201cI felt something hearing this music, and it meant something to me. If you can have a great lyric that also phonetically sounds amazing, then you\u2019re golden. But it\u2019s also kind of cool if you write a song and people are emotionally moved without understanding what\u2019s being said. That, to me, is as powerful.\u201d He favours simplicity, repetition and instant familiarity over unnecessary complexity, but balks at the idea that his songwriting is governed by strict rules. \u201cIt\u2019s about having tools for when you\u2019re stuck,\u201d he says, leaning in as if divulging a secret. \u201cIf you have a verse that\u2019s super-busy, and you want to take it to the next part, you might want something that has a little more space, so [the listener] can take in the information and not get lost.\u201d You can hear this technique on Taylor Swift\u2019s Shake It Off, for example. \u201cThat\u2019s a mathematical way of thinking, it\u2019s not about doing it by feel,\u201d he concedes. \u201cBut if it\u2019s flowing, you don\u2019t need any of that stuff.\u201d He thinks for a moment. \u201cAlso, if there was a hard rule then all of my songs would be huge and, trust me, they\u2019re not.\u201d Martin\u2019s early hit rate largely depended on Spears. A handful of their collaborations forms the backbone of &amp; Juliet, tracing a narrative arc that runs from ... Baby One More Time\u2019s \u201cmy loneliness is killing me\u201d to Stronger\u2019s assertive declaration of the opposite (\u201cMy loneliness ain\u2019t killing me no more\u201d). Did you allow yourself a little high five in the studio when you linked those two songs? \u201cEr \u2026 maybe,\u201d he laughs, self-effacing as ever. He is keen, too, to give the artists he has worked with credit, even when, as he puts it delicately, \u201csomeone isn\u2019t a songwriter per se\u201d. Britney Spears, for instance. \u201cShe\u2019s a genius,\u201d he says, popping a fresh snus. \u201cSo much had happened to her in that [early period] and she had to grow up quickly. We had conversations with her about what she wanted to do and what she wanted to say.\u201d Nonetheless, the world of pop songwriting and production is still dominated by men, easily characterised as ruthless svengalis. \u201cI don\u2019t want to think I\u2019m one of them,\u201d Martin says carefully. \u201cWe try and do our best to make [the studio environment] diverse, welcoming and inclusive. Let\u2019s try and inform and be role models as much as possible in our world and hopefully it will spread.\u201d Would he like to see more female producers? \u201cWomen aren\u2019t encouraged in the right way,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re still programmed to think: \u2018The boys take care of the computers\u2019 and that has to change, and it is changing. Even if you come from a very dark place of,\u201d \u2013 he slips into a convincing American accent \u2013 \u201c\u2018I want to make a lot of money.\u2019 It\u2019s a stupid decision. We\u2019re missing out on 50% of the talent.\u201d A lot of Martin\u2019s biggest hits have been with female artists: not just Spears, Swift and Perry but also British stars such as Adele, Ellie Goulding and Jessie J. He has seen at close proximity what can happen when unimaginable fame takes hold, not least Spears\u2019s distressing, and hugely publicised, breakdown in 2007. \u201cI think we all should be grateful [to the artists],\u201d he says, growing animated for the first time. \u201cIt\u2019s easy for us to say that they become these rich, spoilt divas \u2013 and I\u2019m not talking about Britney specifically, just in general \u2013 but we forget that these artists go out into the world and work and tour and become super-famous for our enjoyment. And then we watch their lives fall apart in front of our eyes for doing something amazing.\u201d He sighs. \u201cI\u2019m so thankful that someone actually still wants that job. I\u2019ve seen it many many times, what fame does. And it goes back to why I don\u2019t do interviews. Especially now with social media: our lives are on display all the time and when you\u2019re famous it\u2019s on a whole other level. We\u2019re not made to be that famous, it\u2019s not normal. It\u2019s not in our DNA.\u201d His more recent work with the likes of Normani and Grande have seen him embrace the fact that pop\u2019s pendulum has swung away from pop and towards R&amp;B and hip-hop, a shift that \u2013 when it happened in the early 00s with the rise of Pharrell Williams\u2019s songwriting and production outfit the Neptunes \u2013 briefly knocked Martin off course. Does he have similar concerns this time? \u201cI\u2019ve come to a point where I try not to think about the perception of the work,\u201d he says. \u201cThe first time it happened, when the boyband era crashed in front of my eyes, I was freaking out a bit, but I\u2019ve never really been worried.\u201d That LA breeziness returns. \u201cI\u2019m not [making music] because I want to be successful; I would be doing this anyway. Also, popular culture is supposed to move.\u201d Making records, he says, is \u201cabout staying inspired, but also sticking to your guns of what you love doing\u201d. Suddenly, the musical\u2019s in-house band starts up next door, a sign that Martin is free to stop doing something he is still learning to love. As we get up to leave, we are joined by a PR who needs to speak to Martin about that evening\u2019s opening press night. One-sided discussions are had about red carpets, photographers and local press, with Martin looking increasingly nervous. \u201cI can still arrive via the side door right?\u201d he says, edging back into the shadows. &amp; Juliet transfers to the Shaftesbury Theatre, London on 2 November. The cast recording is released on 15 November.

Strident, compressed guitars now underpinned his biggest hits, including another breakup masterpiece with Kelly Clarkson, as well as a string of songs with Pink. 2008: Katy Perry \u2013 I Kissed a Girl By riffing on a bit of classic pop \u2013 Gary Glitter\u2019s Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll Part 2, currently causing controversy in Joker \u2013 and adding Perry\u2019s lipstick lesbianism, Martin created one of his most muscular, brilliant hits. 2012: Taylor Swift \u2013 We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together Martin runs the acoustic guitars forwards then reverses them, the perfect sonic symbol for Swift stepping back from country and facing forward into pure pop. 2014: Ariana Grande feat Iggy Azalea\u2013 Problem In Grande, Martin found a Britney-level foil: someone adept at both his traditional melancholia as well as exuberant sass. A string of brilliantly varied hits ensued. 2016: Justin Timberlake \u2013 Can\u2019t Stop the Feeling! With this good angel to the coke-snorting devil that is the Weeknd\u2019s Can\u2019t Feel My Face, another Martin smash the same year, the producer brought an ass-shaking disco sensibility to the middle of the decade. 2019: Sam Smith \u2013 How Do You Sleep? With Grande, Martin has helped to define pop\u2019s current dominant mode, where intimacy and sensuality is prized over trashy bombast, and yet still works in the club. This cut with Sam Smith is a beautiful example.",

Among the photos Sobekwa has produced for their work-in-progress book on Daleside are frank portraits of residents in their bedrooms. One shows an adolescent girl with ginger hair reclining on a bed with a pink crocheted bedspread. Pasted on the wall behind her are hand-drawn pictures and photos torn from magazines. \u201cI was amazed to see posters of people she looked up to on the wall,\u201d says Sobekwa. \u201cThis is what we do in the township.\u201d Interior of one of the first houses in Daleside Sobekwa met the girl\u2019s family at the supermarket and he has often visited them. He has even been invited to stay over \u2013 a noticeably different attitude to that of some white families in the town who have refused to be photographed. There are no mixed-race couples in Daleside. Bosman, Jorden and Naiden chilling outside the Burns\u2019 house \u201cCyprien did some interviews with the white residents by himself,\u201d says Sobekwa. \u201cI was so surprised at what they told him. Most of them don\u2019t like black people. They say black people have brought crime, drugs, all the bad things.\u201d Religion is an important facet of life in this community. Christian icons are commonplace in its homes, says Sobekwa. For the photographer this is another point of overlap with life in South Africa\u2019s black townships. He describes the inhabitants of Daleside as being in \u201cthe same trap as poor black people\u201d \u2013 dependent on religion at a time of worsening income disparities and economic stagnation. Morne in his backyard with his dog Sobekwa sees similarities between the challenges facing Daleside and the township of Thokoza where he grew up. \u201cThis helps me relate to them, to some extent,\u201d he says, \u201cbut there are also differences that make it difficult for me. As an outsider, most of the time I was mistaken for someone who was looking for a job. This wouldn\u2019t happen if I was there with Cyprien. \u201cAt times I\u2019d also feel like I wasn\u2019t connecting with them: for me it is important to connect with the people I photograph. I think it was because I kept being reminded that I did not belong there, even though I felt like I did because of those similarities I saw between our communities.\u201d \u2018Garden boy\u2019 in the middle-class area of Daleside Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter",

A revolutionary new scheme that would require a homebuyer or seller who pulls out of a transaction without a very good reason to pay compensation is set to be trialled by the government early next year. Between a quarter and a third of all house sales fall through, resulting in huge amounts of stress and wasting hundreds of millions of pounds a year. The latest idea to try to make the housing market work better, is a new type of agreement that would \u201clock\u201d people into the process a lot earlier and make it much harder to walk away or move the goalposts \u2013 for example, because they have changed their mind or decided to accept a higher offer. The agreement would involve one or both parties putting down cash at the outset. You would get some money back if the other side later pulls out. So what\u2019s this scheme all about? It\u2019s called a \u201creservation agreement\u201d and is designed not only to cut the number of house sales that fall through, but also to reduce the fear that something will go wrong. The government has been thinking about this for a while but is now moving closer to it becoming a reality. This sort of agreement is already used by a few estate agents, while those buying new-builds are often asked to put down a reservation fee. How would these agreements work? Maybe like this: once a sale has been agreed, the buyer and seller would both be asked to put down some money, which would go into an \u201cescrow account\u201d probably held by lawyers, says Mark Hayward at estate agent body NAEA Propertymark. Both parties would sign the agreement, which would last for a set period. If either side withdraws for a reason that is judged to be not acceptable, they will forfeit the deposit. Perhaps the \u201cwronged\u201d party would simply have their costs covered, or maybe they would get the entire deposit as compensation. Notably, the government\u2019s recently updated online guides to buying and selling a house both refer to \u201creservation agreements\u201d and explicitly talk about compensation. However, it seems likely that different types will be trialled. For example, some might involve only the buyer putting down money. What might be acceptable \u2013 and unacceptable \u2013 reasons for pulling out? Acceptable reasons might include a bereavement, losing your job or an inability to obtain a mortgage. Presumably, a buyer would have to be able to pull out without penalty if the survey came back with serious structural problems or similar \u2013 but coming up with a workable definition of a bad survey could be a challenge. Unacceptable reasons for a buyer to pull out are likely to include reducing an offer at the last minute, while for a seller they would presumably include accepting someone else\u2019s higher offer. How much is this going to cost? There\u2019s no clarity on that yet \u2013 it could be a small percentage of the purchase price or a flat fee and could depend on where in the country you are. A news report this week on website Estate Agent Today suggested that some of the agreements tested may involve a non-returnable deposit of \u00a3500 put down by the buyer, some may require \u00a31,000, and some may not involve any initial payment. If the amount is set too low, a seller in a buoyant market, whose house is going up in value almost by the day, may decide to take the hit because they could get more by accepting a higher offer than they would lose by defaulting on the agreement. But if the amount is set too high, it could be unaffordable for those such as first-time buyers who are already under pressure to amass a deposit and meet all the other costs.

This could happen as early as the first quarter of next year. \u201cThis research, which is still under way, will help inform our decision on whether to roll out reservation agreements as part of a trial, potentially as early as next year,\u201d says the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, which seems to be trying to dial down the excitement on this. Phil Spencer, who presents Channel 4\u2019s Location, Location, Location and is co-founder of advice website Move iQ, believes the pilot \u201cwould be a welcome step forward\u201d.

Chief among its sins is peddling the spectacularly dated myth that all Africans live in mud huts and wear tribal dress. But the crassness of building a replica of the Moffatts\u2019 suburban semi, complete with running water and wifi, in the middle of a tribal village comes a close second. (Is the house going to stay after filming, a strange monument to the days when someone thought this was a good idea? Or will the producers simply demolish it?)</p> <p>Yet this show presumably got commissioned against all the odds because it satisfies a contemporary hunger for simplicity. In a complicated, over-stimulating and sometimes overwhelming western world, there is something seductive about the idea of stripping down and paring back; of having not merely fewer possessions but fewer choices \u2013 fewer demands on our attention and more time for each other.</p> <p>But beware the urge to romanticise simplicity, all the same. The idea of the noble poor, who by virtue of having nothing somehow achieve a level of enlightenment or moral superiority denied to those wallowing blindly in their creature comforts, has deep historical roots. It\u2019s there in biblical lectures about a camel\u2019s failure to pass through the eye of a needle, and in the personal asceticism of monks or in mediaeval idealisation of the peasant. It\u2019s in the Victorian concept of the \u201cnoble savage\u201d, or the idea that primitive peoples uncorrupted by modern civilisation represent some kind of moral ideal, and in the backwoods American romanticism of Henry Thoreau and dreams of a return to living off the land. </p> <p>It\u2019s still there today in every city commuter fantasising about moving to the country and buying chickens, just as it was in their parents glued to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2011/aug/30/box-set-club-the-good-life\" title=\"\">The Good Life\u2019s</a> version of suburban self-sufficiency; after all, a mud-spattered Tom and Barbara might not have enjoyed the material comforts of Margo and Jerry next door, but despite living off nettle soup, they were clearly happier. Back in 2010, the Conservatives audaciously tapped into the same spirit by portraying their austerity programme as a virtuous, almost enjoyably thrifty, process of cutting back on stuff the nation supposedly didn\u2019t need.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"42b3b1eda0b61ca3b3d6a7a179a06351430a0d8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42b3b1eda0b61ca3b3d6a7a179a06351430a0d8b/0_11_2052_1510/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Mud-spattered Tom and Barbara might not have enjoyed material comforts but they were clearly happier.\u2019 Felicity Kendal in The Good Life.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"736\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Mud-spattered Tom and Barbara might not have enjoyed material comforts but they were clearly happier.\u2019 Felicity Kendal in The Good Life.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now it\u2019s politics itself that is being simplified, stripped back to easy slogans \u2013 take back control, get Brexit done \u2013 which belie how impossibly complicated it is in practice.

Invariably, the poor family boggles at the ridiculous amount of money their alter egos burn through every week, before cheerily blowing a fortune on the food shop because for once it\u2019s lovely not to have to think about the cost. Meanwhile, the rich family blanches at their budget before bravely concluding that they can do without his\u2019n\u2019hers massages this week, and actually isn\u2019t it quite jolly to stay in and have a family games night for free? They generally go home chastened to their swimming pool and rolling acres, professing deep respect for how the other half manage and sometimes even vowing to tone it down a bit.</p> <p>We have moved on from shows like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/12/benefits-street-poverty-porn-british-fury\" title=\"\">Benefit Street</a>, deemed cruel for holding the poor up to ridicule, into shows that use them to teach the rich a lesson. It\u2019s less poverty porn than soft-focus poverty romance \u2013 smothering the reality of what it\u2019s like to scrimp week after week under cosy homilies about how money can\u2019t buy happiness. Which is invariably the sort of thing rich people say in order to ease the guilt of knowing that other people are poor.</p> <p>You only have to watch a few episodes to realise why these shows have to end on a cheery teachable moment; otherwise, the overall effect would be somewhere between intolerably bleak and enraging. It never seems fair that the kids in one family are spoilt while in the other they\u2019re struggling, and it\u2019s deeply uncomfortable to watch children who have tasted a very different kind of life sent back to their tiny shared bedrooms. The only way to defuse the situation is to pretend there\u2019s something noble and valuable about poverty, as if to go without was some kind of precious gift.</p> <p>So beware the cult of simplicity, at least when it glosses over things that need to be complicated. Even a simple life is rarely as simple as it looks.</p> <p>\u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "There are so many ways in which The British Tribe Next Door is offensive that it\u2019s arguably amazing the TV programme ever made it to the screen. The first episode of Channel 4\u2019s series \u2013 which sends the British reality TV star Scarlett Moffatt and her family to live with a traditional Namibian tribe, and both sides examine the material excesses of the family\u2019s western lives \u2013 has aired to a chorus of outrage from activist groups such as the anti-colonialism group No White Saviors. Chief among its sins is peddling the spectacularly dated myth that all Africans live in mud huts and wear tribal dress. But the crassness of building a replica of the Moffatts\u2019 suburban semi, complete with running water and wifi, in the middle of a tribal village comes a close second. (Is the house going to stay after filming, a strange monument to the days when someone thought this was a good idea? Or will the producers simply demolish it?) Yet this show presumably got commissioned against all the odds because it satisfies a contemporary hunger for simplicity. In a complicated, over-stimulating and sometimes overwhelming western world, there is something seductive about the idea of stripping down and paring back; of having not merely fewer possessions but fewer choices \u2013 fewer demands on our attention and more time for each other. But beware the urge to romanticise simplicity, all the same. The idea of the noble poor, who by virtue of having nothing somehow achieve a level of enlightenment or moral superiority denied to those wallowing blindly in their creature comforts, has deep historical roots. It\u2019s there in biblical lectures about a camel\u2019s failure to pass through the eye of a needle, and in the personal asceticism of monks or in mediaeval idealisation of the peasant. It\u2019s in the Victorian concept of the \u201cnoble savage\u201d, or the idea that primitive peoples uncorrupted by modern civilisation represent some kind of moral ideal, and in the backwoods American romanticism of Henry Thoreau and dreams of a return to living off the land. It\u2019s still there today in every city commuter fantasising about moving to the country and buying chickens, just as it was in their parents glued to The Good Life\u2019s version of suburban self-sufficiency; after all, a mud-spattered Tom and Barbara might not have enjoyed the material comforts of Margo and Jerry next door, but despite living off nettle soup, they were clearly happier. Back in 2010, the Conservatives audaciously tapped into the same spirit by portraying their austerity programme as a virtuous, almost enjoyably thrifty, process of cutting back on stuff the nation supposedly didn\u2019t need. Now it\u2019s politics itself that is being simplified, stripped back to easy slogans \u2013 take back control, get Brexit done \u2013 which belie how impossibly complicated it is in practice. In corporate life the new buzzword is \u201csingle-tasking\u201d, or just concentrating on one thing at a time, while Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg has famously reduced his wardrobe to identical grey T-shirts to save time thinking about what to wear in the morning. Even the Duke and Duchess of Sussex apparently long to swap the prying photographers\u2019 lenses and the gilded cage of Buckingham Palace for a vaguely defined but simpler existence somewhere in Africa. Luxury has come to mean less, not more; purging, not accumulating. But somewhere along the line we risk forgetting that for most people, less is generally the very opposite of luxurious. The nonsense in Namibia is just an extreme version of the craze for \u201clife swap\u201d shows like Channel 5\u2019s Rich House, Poor House, in which a rich family trades houses and budgets with a low-income one for a week, in a supposed examination of the wealth divide. Invariably, the poor family boggles at the ridiculous amount of money their alter egos burn through every week, before cheerily blowing a fortune on the food shop because for once it\u2019s lovely not to have to think about the cost. Meanwhile, the rich family blanches at their budget before bravely concluding that they can do without his\u2019n\u2019hers massages this week, and actually isn\u2019t it quite jolly to stay in and have a family games night for free? They generally go home chastened to their swimming pool and rolling acres, professing deep respect for how the other half manage and sometimes even vowing to tone it down a bit. We have moved on from shows like Benefit Street, deemed cruel for holding the poor up to ridicule, into shows that use them to teach the rich a lesson. It\u2019s less poverty porn than soft-focus poverty romance \u2013 smothering the reality of what it\u2019s like to scrimp week after week under cosy homilies about how money can\u2019t buy happiness. Which is invariably the sort of thing rich people say in order to ease the guilt of knowing that other people are poor. You only have to watch a few episodes to realise why these shows have to end on a cheery teachable moment; otherwise, the overall effect would be somewhere between intolerably bleak and enraging. It never seems fair that the kids in one family are spoilt while in the other they\u2019re struggling, and it\u2019s deeply uncomfortable to watch children who have tasted a very different kind of life sent back to their tiny shared bedrooms. The only way to defuse the situation is to pretend there\u2019s something noble and valuable about poverty, as if to go without was some kind of precious gift. So beware the cult of simplicity, at least when it glosses over things that need to be complicated. Even a simple life is rarely as simple as it looks. \u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist",

As part of the Guardian\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/series/automating-poverty\">Automating Poverty series</a>, Robert Booth looked at how and why the UK\u2019s Department of Work and Pensions is increasing investment in testing artificial intelligence to assess citizens\u2019 claims about their childcare and housing costs. As Booth discusses with host Jordan Erica Webber, technology can be useful, freeing up human time for much-needed personal interaction. But as Chips so often brings home, the use of technology can be insidious and, when left unchecked, could leave vulnerable people who use the benefits system in an even more vulnerable position. <em>Katherine Godfrey</em></p> <h2><strong>Producer pick: <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-stadio-podcast/id1474953937\">Stadio</a></strong></h2> <p><em><strong>Chosen by Jonathan Fisher, Guardian Football Weekly producer</strong> <br></em>The Guardian\u2019s Football Weekly podcast features a rotating cast of journalists, comedians, experts and enthusiasts.

Elsewhere, boutique North Yorkshire festival Deer Shed launches a two-day pod offshoot, Podcast Social Club, on 22 November with a range of podcasters including comedian Jessica Fostekew and Gabriel Ebulue, host of the Desert Island Discs-esque Three Track Podcast. Picks of the week Bad Batch From the makers of the smash hit Dr Death comes a new, equally shocking tale of medical-themed disaster. Stem cells have been hailed as a miracle cure for many conditions. However \u2013 as with most new and evolving treatments \u2013 there are horror stories, too. Laura Beil\u2019s new six-parter examines the cases of patients who were hospitalised after undergoing treatment provided by a Californian company, exploring a worryingly unregulated industry. Hannah J Davies The Horror of Dolores Roach Podcast Gimlet\u2019s dark, scripted podcast, about a woman who returns from prison to find her loved ones have fled her newly-gentrified New York block, is already being made into a TV series as the second season drops. Daphne Rubin\u2013Vega is a force as Roach, who\u2019s just blown up her building and is lurking in the tunnels beneath the city, meeting Lea DeLaria (Orange Is the New Black) and Amy Ryan (The Wire). Graphic descriptions of violence and the sound of dripping seep in from the start. Hannah Verdier Guardian pick: Chips with Everything \u2013 the digital welfare state This week, the Guardian\u2019s digital culture podcast looks into what it\u2019s like to be at the sharp end of new technology when it could affect something as fundamental as being able to pay your rent. As part of the Guardian\u2019s Automating Poverty series, Robert Booth looked at how and why the UK\u2019s Department of Work and Pensions is increasing investment in testing artificial intelligence to assess citizens\u2019 claims about their childcare and housing costs. As Booth discusses with host Jordan Erica Webber, technology can be useful, freeing up human time for much-needed personal interaction. But as Chips so often brings home, the use of technology can be insidious and, when left unchecked, could leave vulnerable people who use the benefits system in an even more vulnerable position. Katherine Godfrey Producer pick: Stadio Chosen by Jonathan Fisher, Guardian Football Weekly producer The Guardian\u2019s Football Weekly podcast features a rotating cast of journalists, comedians, experts and enthusiasts. Musa Okwonga fits into at least three of those categories and made his long\u2013awaited studio debut this Thursday. Stadio, the podcast he produces with friend and musician Ryan Hunn, is also predominantly football-focused, with sojourns into David Bowie, politics and personal anecdotes. It feels warm and intimate \u2013 two people who know each other very well and have no inclination to compete for airtime. They\u2019re a match in temperament, intelligence and background knowledge, and Okwonga\u2019s infectious laugh is a real highlight. It\u2019s a comfortable listen, which covers everything from the games with the biggest TV audiences in Europe to Okwonga\u2019s amateur tournaments without missing a beat.",

Gemma Evans, 36, will be representing the Women\u2019s Equality party in a general election in the Greater Manchester seat held by Ivan Lewis, who was under investigation by the Labour party for sexual harassment before quitting in December 2018. He denies the allegation. The WEP is urging Labour, who have announced an all-women shortlist for the seat, to adopt its policies in return for its candidate standing down. In his resignation letter, Lewis cited Labour\u2019s record on antisemitism and fears that the disciplinary process against him was \u201csubject to political manipulation\u201d. His departure meant the party\u2019s investigation into the allegations was never concluded.

Evans, who works as a motivational speaker and domestic violence campaigner, said she was shocked that despite a wave of sexual harassment and abuse accusations sweeping Westminster in the wake of the #MeToo scandal, many of the accused MPs were still standing for re-election. When she saw the WEP\u2019s announcement in August that they would stand against Lewis, she immediately put herself forward. She said she could not change what had happened to her, but might be able to stop it happening to others \u201cby standing up and speaking out for women who haven\u2019t got a voice of their own\u201d and \u201cbringing it to the attention of Westminster\u201d.

Evans is one of five survivors of domestic violence or sexual assault that the WEP is fielding to stand against male MPs who have been accused of violence or harassment. Lewis has denied making non-consensual sexual advances after one woman alleged that he touched her leg and invited her to his house during a Labour party event in 2010, when she was 19. In 2007, he apologised after sending suggestive texts to a young civil servant.

The WEP wants to amend the Recall Act to extend the conditions where an incumbent can face a recall petition and possible byelection to include MPs who are found guilty of sexual harassment or violence by parliament\u2019s independent investigation process. The WEP is also standing candidates in the constituencies of Cities of London and Westminster, Luton North, Dover and Sheffield Hallam. Since the announcement of the campaign, Mark Field, the Conservative MP for Cities of London and Westminster, has announced that he will not be seeking re-election.

Stewart received both praise and ridicule on social media after the awkward exchange on Brick Lane in the summer during which he stopped the men to ask if they would make a film with him, shook their hands and said he was running to be prime minister.

A source close to Stewart said: \u201cThis was obviously a light-hearted, self-deprecatory remark \u2013 where Rory was reflecting on an amiable exchange he had when walking along Brick Lane. \u201cAnyone who knows anything about Rory would know it\u2019s absurd to suggest he was implying anything malign, and if any offence was caused he\u2019d be the first to apologise.\u201d In 2010, Stewart apologised to his Cumbrian constituents after saying that local people were \u201cpretty primitive\u201d and held up their trousers with \u201cbits of twine\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The marathon and walking events at next summer\u2019s Olympic Games could start at 5am to prevent them being moved hundreds of kilometres to Japan\u2019s northernmost island of Hokkaido due to heat concerns. Government officials in Tokyo toyed with the idea of proposing a new marathon start time of 3am but are now leaning towards 5am, Kyodo news agency said. The move follows a decision by the International Olympic Committee [IOC] last week to move the events to the city of Sapporo, 800km north of Tokyo, to avoid exposing athletes and spectators from sweltering temperatures. Confirmation of a relocation to Sapporo, host of the 1972 Winter Olympics, would anger fans who have already secured tickets and booked accommodation in Tokyo. Distance running is hugely popular in Japan, and the marathons are expected to draw large crowds. Rising concern over the capital\u2019s sweltering summer temperatures had already forced the Games\u2019 organisers to shift the start times for the men\u2019s and women\u2019s marathons to 6am, and the men\u2019s 50km walk final to 5.30am, to give athletes time to complete the courses before temperatures soar. The IOC decision drew an angry response from Tokyo\u2019s governor, Yuriko Koike, who said the IOC, the International Association of Athletics Federations and the Tokyo Games organising committee had not consulted the metropolitan government before making their \u201csudden\u201d decision. She said Tokyo had made efforts to reduce the impact of the heat, such as installing cooling mist machines and surfacing roads along the route with a heat-reducing reflective material. \u201cOf course, the athletes-first approach is extremely important,\u201d Koike said. Noting that the Games, which run from 24 July to 9 August, were less than 300 days away, she added: \u201cTo choose Sapporo so suddenly \u2026 why Sapporo, who decided this? There was no discussion, and I have a lot of doubts about having this thrust on us.

Turkey is host to an estimated 3.6 million Syrians who have fled war in the neighbouring country, a situation that has increasingly become a domestic political headache for the country\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan.

reported that the heads of the defence and home affairs ministries had discussed draconian new powers to allow the Australian Signals Directorate to spy on Australian citizens for the first time.</p>

\u201ctop secret\u201d information that had been distributed through communications intelligence channels only.</p> <p>These markings meant the document required the \u201chighest degree of protection\u201d, because disclosure could cause \u201cexceptionally grave damage to the national interest\u201d, it said. </p> <p>It argued the defence security manual stipulates documents should not be marked secret merely to \u201cprevent embarrassment to an individual, organisation or agency\u201d. </p> <p>The AFP and Porter argued the \u201cprescribed document\u201d was obtained by Smethurst contrary to Part VII of the Act and so section 79(3) \u201crestricted the further disclosure of that document by Ms Smethurst if she both intended that further disclosure and she knew that the

      "bodyText": "Christian Porter has asked the high court to refuse a bid to destroy material collected from the raid on News Corp journalist Annika Smethurst\u2019s home, arguing it \u201cmay well be important\u201d for a potential future prosecution. While the attorney general has said he is \u201cseriously disinclined\u201d to approve prosecution of journalists who have \u201cdone no more than pursue public interest journalism\u201d, Porter has intervened to support the Australian federal police in Smethurst\u2019s high court case by asking the court to uphold the validity of the raid warrant and secrecy laws. In September Porter issued a new direction requiring his consent for prosecution for a range of secrecy offences. Police have indicated the raids on Smethurst and the ABC headquarters were investigating both journalists and their sources and have never ruled out referring the cases for possible prosecution of journalists. In their joint submission, the solicitor general, Stephen Donaghue, noted the AFP is still considering whether to give a brief of evidence to the commonwealth director of public prosecutions so the court should \u201cleave it to the trial judge in any future criminal prosecution to determine whether that material will be admitted\u201d rather than order its destruction. In June the AFP raided Smethurst\u2019s home, investigating an alleged breach of section 79(3) of the Crimes Act, which prohibits \u201ccommunicating or allowing someone to have access to an official secret without authorisation\u201d. In April 2018 Smethurst had reported that the heads of the defence and home affairs ministries had discussed draconian new powers to allow the Australian Signals Directorate to spy on Australian citizens for the first time. Smethurst has argued the offence breaches the implied freedom of political communication because it is not limited to disclosures that are inherently harmful and gives the government \u201cunconstrained discretion\u201d to protect its information even where it is \u201cwholly innocuous, or merely embarrassing\u201d to the government. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The AFP and attorney general\u2019s joint submission noted the case concerns publication of part of a document marked to indicate it contained \u201csecret AUSTEO\u201d (for Australian eyes only) information, and \u201ctop secret\u201d information that had been distributed through communications intelligence channels only. These markings meant the document required the \u201chighest degree of protection\u201d, because disclosure could cause \u201cexceptionally grave damage to the national interest\u201d, it said. It argued the defence security manual stipulates documents should not be marked secret merely to \u201cprevent embarrassment to an individual, organisation or agency\u201d. The AFP and Porter argued the \u201cprescribed document\u201d was obtained by Smethurst contrary to Part VII of the Act and so section 79(3) \u201crestricted the further disclosure of that document by Ms Smethurst if she both intended that further disclosure and she knew that the disclosure of the information to her was contrary to a duty to keep that information secret\u201d. Their submission argued the section had a \u201clegitimate purpose\u201d to \u201creduce the risk of prejudice to the security or defence of the commonwealth from the disclosure of secret information\u201d. That purpose was \u201ccentrally important to the preservation and protection of the system of representative and responsible government\u201d, and was of such importance that it \u201cmay justify very large incursions on the freedom\u201d. The submission argued the law is both necessary and adequate in its balance, rejecting Smethurst\u2019s contention that secrets could be protected with less restrictive laws. Even if the court sides with Smethurst on the legality of the offence and the raid, the joint submission argued the material \u201cmight still be admissible in the event that criminal proceedings are commenced in relation to the facts underlying this proceeding\u201d \u2013 including against Smethurst\u2019s source. That\u2019s because the Evidence Act gives courts discretion to allow the admission of unlawfully obtained material. The submission argued there was a \u201cstrong argument\u201d to do so because any breach was not \u201cdeliberate or contumelious\u201d because the AFP believed they were authorised. The Australian Human Rights Commission has also asked the court to appear, arguing it is part of its role to protect freedom of expression and the right to take part in the conduct of public affairs. The AHRC argued that while the commonwealth has a head of power to to designate prescribed information \u2013 and hence prohibit publication by its employees and contractors \u2013 that does not extend to people, such as journalists, who do not otherwise have a duty to treat it as secret.",

Comedian Kelly Bachman told the Guardian she \u201cfelt like the air was sucked out of the room\u201d when she called out Weinstein during a set she performed at the event. She embraced the silence, she said. \u201cI was okay with the fact that there was silence. In a situation like this, I don\u2019t want people to feel comfortable.\u201d Bachman, along with fellow comedian Amber Rollo and actor Zoe Stuckless, confronted the disgraced producer, who has been accused by more than 80 women of rape, sexual assault and harassment, at an event called Actors Hour on Wednesday night. Weinstein was in attendance, sitting at a table along with several young women and two body guards. \u201cI\u2019m a comic, and it\u2019s our job to name the elephant in the room,\u201d she said, in a video posted on her social media accounts. \u201cIt\u2019s a Freddy Krueger in the room, if you will. I didn\u2019t realize I needed to bring my own mace and rape whistle to Actors Hour.\u201d Members of the audience booed her, and shouted \u201cshut up\u201d, to which Bachman responded, \u201cSorry, that killed at group therapy for rape survivors\u201d. At intermission, Stuckless and Rollo approached Weinstein at his table. \u201cNobody\u2019s going to say anything?

Gerard Benedet, previously the chief of staff to the former Queensland Liberal-National leader Tim Nicholls, has been appointed the new Queensland director of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia. The guild, which represents pharmacy owners, was criticised by its own members and others in the industry in April when Guardian Australia reported it had donated $15,000 to One Nation last year. \u201cThe Pharmacy Guild doesn\u2019t speak for pharmacists \u2013 we are proud of our diversity \u2026 we condemn One Nation and its policies,\u201d the vice-president of Professional Pharmacists Australia, Carmel McCallum, said at the time. The guild defended the donation at the time, saying it paid to attend political functions \u201cacross the political spectrum\u201d but did not necessarily endorse their views. But in Benedet, the guild has appointed one of Australia\u2019s best-known conservative political warriors. Benedet has also worked for the former federal Liberal party leader Brendan Nelson and the Howard-era minister Helen Coonan. But he\u2019s best known for his work with Advance Australia, formed in November 2018 as a counterweight to the progressive campaign group GetUp. Benedet helped spearhead the group\u2019s unsuccessful campaign to defend the former prime minister Tony Abbott from a challenge in his seat of Warringah at the 2019 election. Advance Australia was criticised during the campaign for producing a sexualised video featuring Abbott\u2019s competitor, Zali Steggall.

A spokeswoman for Bolivia\u2019s electoral board said 0.01% votes have been voided in the region of Beni with new voting there scheduled for November. She said they were not enough to change the outcome. The disputed victory will likely stoke tensions in Bolivia after days of protests and angry clashes in towns and cities across the country amid allegations of vote tampering made by the opposition. In a video message, Mesa accused Morales\u2019 government of orchestrating a \u201cshameful and crude alteration of the result of our vote\u201d and called for peaceful demonstrations to continue indefinitely. On Thursday the European Union joined calls by the Organisation of American States for a run-off vote to take place even if Morales cleared the 10-point margin, stating it was the \u201cbest option \u2026 to restore trust and ensure the full respect of the democratic choice of the Bolivian people\u201d. But on Friday the outcome was welcomed by Mexico. \u201cThe government of Mexico congratulates [Morales] for his victory and we wish him the greatest success in his next term,\u201d wrote Maximiliano Reyes Zuniga, Mexico\u2019s deputy foreign minister for Latin America and the Caribbean. Expressions of concern by international observers came after an unexplained 24-hour pause in reporting official quick count vote results which was followed by a boost in votes for Morales when the count was restarted on Monday. Manuel Gonz\u00e1lez, the head of the OAS election observation team, called it a \u201cdrastic and hard-to-explain change in the trend\u201d. However, Mark Weisbrot, co-director of the Centre for Economic and Policy Research, said the OAS had provided \u201cno evidence \u2013 no statistics, numbers, or facts of any kind \u2013 to support this idea.\u201d He called it \u201cirresponsible\u201d in the context of post-election violence in Bolivia.

      "bodyText": "The Department of Human Services has not ruled out targeting age pensioners and other vulnerable people as part of the controversial robodebt scheme, saying any decision to expand the scheme in order to meet budget targets would be made \u201cfurther down the track\u201d. Guardian Australia revealed in August a leaked ministerial submission draft created by the department recommended Scott Morrison\u2019s cabinet sign on off 350,000 online debt compliance reviews of older and vulnerable Australians over the next three years. The expansion was needed to meet the department\u2019s $2.1bn in projected fiscal savings over the next three years, with the documents noting \u201cestimated savings over the forward estimates cannot be achieved without undertaking sensitive cohort reviews\u201d. But it appears the plan detailed by the Guardian was killed off by the government, at least for the short-term, estimates heard on Thursday night. The Greens senator Rachel Senator asked the department secretary Renee Leon whether Human Services had advised the government to expand the scheme to older Australians and the vulnerable, who have been ring-fenced since 2017. Leon replied: \u201cThe government has no plans to recommence those.\u201d Siewert said: \u201cThat doesn\u2019t answer my question, have you provided advice?\u201d \u201cWe discuss the operation of the program with government from time to time and in the course of that the government has indicated that it has no intention to recommence the reviews of those cohorts,\u201d said Leon. Officials also conceded that the department mistakenly sent out 10,000 debt notices in April as a result of a \u201cmanual staff error\u201d, but said the mistake was picked up within three days. It was also revealed in Senate questions on notice that Centrelink had issued debts to 169 welfare recipients who were already dead, while it also approached representatives of \u201cdeceased customers\u201d in 515 cases. Almost all the debts were waived. The robodebt scheme has been dogged by criticism and is currently the subject of a second Senate inquiry, a federal court challenge and a potential class action. Later, when asked by Labor\u2019s Claire Moore if the government could make its budget targets while excluding older people and the vulnerable she said a decision could be made in future. Leon said there was no \u201ccurrent\u201d proposal or \u201cimmediate fiscal need\u201d to make a decision while officials maintained the scheme was on track to meet its projected savings. But asked it she had ruled out expanding the scheme, Leon said: \u201cWhether we will need to go to government and seek their views about putting them back in is a matter that we\u2019ll come to further down the track depending on the progress of the program.\u201d The documents seen by the Guardian proposed a phased-in approach to conducting robodebt reviews of older Australians, and those with a Centrelink \u201cvulnerability indicator\u201d, such as the homeless and disabled. It would have begun with a small number of reviews early next year, the documents said. Overall, more than one million robodebts are projected to be launched over the next three years, a seperate Senate inquiry has been told. The department also faced pointed questioning about the legal foundations of the scheme. Officials initially asked to take on notice questions from Labor\u2019s Kimberley Kitching about which specific legislation the government relied on to administer the scheme. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t require specific legislation, Senator, because the social security legislation requires the department to make sure people are paid accurately if information comes to us,\u201d Leon said. She was asked by Kitching if the department had \u201cany concerns about the lack of legal foundation for the scheme, particularly its reverse onus of proof\u201d. \u201cWe don\u2019t accept that there\u2019s a reverse onus of proof, Senator,\u201d Leon replied. Department officials later referred to section 66A of the Social Security (Administration) Act, which outlines the requirement for recipients to \u201cinform of a change of circumstances\u201d. Critics have argued the section does not relate to debt recovery and does not provide legal basis for the scheme.",

      "bodyText": "Twenty-four hours out from the do-or-die Rugby World Cup semi-final in Japan, All Blacks fans across New Zealand are beginning to feel a quiver of nervousness. The country\u2019s state broadcaster assured fans on Thursday that the game would still broadcast on free-to-air TV despite its headquarters suffering smoke damage from a fire at the nearby Skycity convention centre. Meanwhile, watching parties are planned around the country, with a long weekend and 9pm kick-off delighting fans, many of whom must travel from remote areas to pubs and hotels to ensure they get decent coverage. One fan is so confident of an All Blacks win, he has already had a tattoo celebrating the victory inked, while those working night shifts are turning their phones, internet and TV off to avoid spoiling the outcome. As the game approaches, rugby talk has hit saturation point, with the New Zealand Herald examining the UK media\u2019s analysis of the All Blacks and turning advertisements on its homepage black, while Stuff ran a national world cup \u201cRWC Mood-O-Meter\u201d, rating the current station of the nation as \u201cNo Worries\u201d. At parliament house in Wellington politicians were also gearing up, with the speaker of the house, Trevor Mallard, donning a signed All Blacks jersey to deliver his weekly Facebook update. \u201cShowing my support for the All Blacks this weekend \u2013 does the jersey go well with the speaker\u2019s robes?\u201d Mallard said in his Facebook caption. Sports and recreation minister and mega-fan Grant Robertson will be watching the game live at Yokohama Stadium and said he was beginning to feel jittery about the outcome. \u201cLike I imagine a lot of New Zealanders will be, I am a bit nervous but I am also quietly confident the All Blacks are going to take the win,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cIt\u2019s always important with games at this stage of the World Cup to take nothing for granted \u2013 England will be giving it everything they\u2019ve got, but so too will the ABs.\u201d The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, will be watching too. Following New Zealands win against Ireland last week she posted an Instagram picture of the victory. \u201cWe\u2019re right behind you for the semis,\u201d Ardern said. William Nelson, 27, a rugby fan from Hawkes Bay, said England was the only team who could potentially spell defeat for the All Blacks. \u201cI\u2019m much more nervous about this game than I was about Ireland \u2013 I think England are the only team that have a decent chance of beating us and I think whoever wins the semi-final will go on to win the World Cup,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cI\u2019m excited too as I think it will be a super entertaining game. I just hope the game doesn\u2019t get decided by a controversial referring call \u2013 but in saying that I\u2019m glad we\u2019ve got Nigel Owens as the referee \u2013 he\u2019s the best referee in the game by a fair margin in my opinion.\u201d Sports psychologist Steve Jackson has advised fans to keep expectations low to avoid disappointment. \u201cPeople forget, they think the All Blacks are the favourites, but New Zealand has a lot less money and resources than many other countries,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThe All Blacks are actually the underdogs, they are expected to win, which is a lot of pressure, but the reality is they do amazingly well with very little. And I think trying to reframe things as \u2018we\u2019re the underdogs going in\u2019 is probably a better way of looking at it in terms of managing anxiety about the outcome.\u201d Jackson said in New Zealand \u201cmore people go to rugby games than go to church; the passion for the game is extreme\u201d, but also that some Kiwis were growing fatigued of rugby\u2019s dominance in the cultural psyche and fed up with the violence and excessive alcohol consumption that is often associated with match nights. \u201cI do see a growing number of people resenting the prominent place rugby has in New Zealand\u2019s story \u2013 that it has displaced almost any other form of culture.\u201d Jackson said there had been no definitive studies linking poor mental health outcomes in fans if their favourite teams lose, though there was strong anecdotal evidence that more violence could occur in homes and pubs, and moods could dip for days following a significant loss. Sean Cuttance of Methven in the South Island is a rugby coach and former professional player. He said he would be disappointed if the All Blacks lose on Saturday, but he\u2019ll survive \u2013 partly due to his professional rugby training. \u201cAs a coach I do understand fans mental health can take a knock [if the All Blacks lose]. Kiwis love their rugby and it means a lot to them,\u201d says Cuttance. \u201cBut I know listening to the All Blacks themselves and coaching and management staff, they\u2019re very pragmatic about a win or a loss and they\u2019re not so emotional and that\u2019s a good way to lead it..\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Agriculture ministers have agreed to a national framework to address the impact of climate change on the sector, as well as to develop plans to help the industry grow to $100bn by 2030. At a meeting in Melbourne on Friday federal, state and territory agriculture ministers \u2013 and federal water resources minister David Littleproud \u2013 agreed to Victoria\u2019s plan to improve adaptation of agriculture for climate change. In September Littleproud controversially said that he doesn\u2019t \u201cknow if climate change is manmade\u201d before backing down and \u201ctotally\u201d accepting that worsening droughts are linked to climate change. The ministers also agreed to meet twice a year and were forewarned by the federal government that the next phase of its drought policy will \u201crequire heavy lifting from the states\u201d. The warning was interpreted as a reference to a plan under consideration by the Morrison government, first reported in the Courier Mail, for drought-declared farmers to be exempt from paying income tax and for the states to suspend payroll tax for affected businesses. Discussions about the adequacy of the commonwealth\u2019s response to drought dominated this sitting week of parliament, after the National Farmers Federation called for it to pay council rates for affected businesses and to offer exit packages for those wanting to leave the land. The Nationals asked the government to pay $10m to drought-affected councils, co-funded with state governments, a policy estimated to cost $1.3bn given there are currently 123 councils who would be eligible. The Courier Mail reported that after cabinet meets in Sydney on 30 October Scott Morrison is expected to unveil the next phase of its drought policy before attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings in Chile in mid-November.

At domestic level she was forced to reinvent herself to continue her career after the Melbourne Vixens opted not to offer her a contract in 2011.

Though her support network suggested she take some time out, Thwaites was adamant that she needed to push through, only feeling like she was truly herself when she was playing netball. Managing mental health conditions is an ongoing challenge, but she credits her time in New Zealand and discovering what she needed to do improve her game physically with helping reground herself mentally.</p> <p>Thwaites is a player who has lived. She has experienced incredible highs and dark lows. She has been dropped from teams, picked up by others and changed her game to force her way to the top. She has been a starting VII player and one who has been confined to the bench for games on end.</p> <p>With her retirement, the Diamonds are not simply losing a player who has played against international teams 55 times. They are losing someone who has a deep understanding of what it means to be an elite athlete and how that experience can come in many shapes and forms. They are losing someone who can adapt to changing circumstances because her life has been full of them. They are losing a player who has earned the title of Diamond because she was created under pressure.</p>",

While New Zealand\u2019s older, wiser team can rely on years of experience lining up against the Diamonds to play through the more physical style of the Australians, the women in green and gold look perplexed when trying to navigate the unfamiliar zone defence of the Silver Ferns. When Thwaites came on to the court on Sunday, she brought movement and drive, front holds and decisiveness \u2013 the perfect ingredients to counteract a zone defence. It was the smart and calm play of an experienced head, something that can\u2019t be easily replaced. Her career has not followed the simplest route; at Diamonds level it was six years between her first inclusion in the squad and her international debut. At domestic level she was forced to reinvent herself to continue her career after the Melbourne Vixens opted not to offer her a contract in 2011. Instead Thwaites headed to New Zealand, playing with the Central Pulse for three years before a move back to Australia and an opportunity with the NSW Swifts. Thwaites has since spoken of the depression and anxiety she experienced while in her first stint with the Vixens. Though her support network suggested she take some time out, Thwaites was adamant that she needed to push through, only feeling like she was truly herself when she was playing netball. Managing mental health conditions is an ongoing challenge, but she credits her time in New Zealand and discovering what she needed to do improve her game physically with helping reground herself mentally. Thwaites is a player who has lived. She has experienced incredible highs and dark lows. She has been dropped from teams, picked up by others and changed her game to force her way to the top. She has been a starting VII player and one who has been confined to the bench for games on end. With her retirement, the Diamonds are not simply losing a player who has played against international teams 55 times. They are losing someone who has a deep understanding of what it means to be an elite athlete and how that experience can come in many shapes and forms. They are losing someone who can adapt to changing circumstances because her life has been full of them. They are losing a player who has earned the title of Diamond because she was created under pressure.",
