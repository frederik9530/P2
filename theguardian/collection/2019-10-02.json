      "bodyText": "The home secretary is to risk angering police by ordering a third inquiry into Scotland Yard\u2019s disastrous investigation into a fictitious establishment paedophile and murder ring. Priti Patel is expected to announce the investigation on Friday, the day Scotland Yard releases more details of its own review by a retired judge into how police fell for the fabrications of a fantasist, Carl Beech, who was subsequently jailed for 18 years for lying to detectives. Patel\u2019s aides have already been in contact with Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) over the new review but its scope is unclear. Beech\u2019s lies about historical child abuse and murder prompted a massive Metropolitan police inquiry from 2014 to 2016 known as Operation Midland. The homes of the former military chief Lord Bramall, the former Tory MP Harvey Proctor and the former home secretary Leon Brittan were all raided and the three men questioned under caution. All were exonerated and they and their families were furious about their treatment. The police watchdog has already investigated and concluded the evidence did not merit a disciplinary charge against any officer, let alone a criminal charge. That conclusion has angered the victims, including Proctor. The retired judge who wrote the Met\u2019s report, Sir Richard Henriques, told a newspaper of his outrage at the finding, alleging police broke the law to obtain search warrants and that a criminal investigation should follow. News of the potential third inquiry was first reported by the Daily Mail, which said the HMIC investigation would be into the Met\u2019s response to the Henriques report. But other sources told the Guardian that HMIC\u2019s inquiry could be limited in scope and possibly confined to issues surrounding the police\u2019s gaining of search warrants, which was lambasted by Henriques. Patel is keen to rebuild relations with the police after a decade of tension between those in law and order and the Conservatives. The home secretary has the power to ask HMIC to investigate almost anything; however, given the police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), has already done so and concluded no charges should follow, her intervention risks police anger. One senior source told the Guardian: \u201cPoliticians will continue to use the police as a football to further their own agendas. All we can do is be led by what we believe to be true.\u201d In his report for the Met, a small part of which was released in November 2016, Henriques said police misled a judge to get the warrants and wrote: \u201cThe gravity of a judge being misled in such circumstances cannot be overstated.\u201d He called for the police watchdog to investigate. After Beech\u2019s conviction the IOPC announced the officers would face no action, prompting Henriques to renew his call, followed by some in the media and Proctor. The Met\u2019s commissioner, Cressida Dick, has said she does not see a need for a new inquiry. A fortnight ago Patel held a meeting with the Met deputy commissioner, Sir Stephen House, about Operation Midland and its fallout. The report based on the IOPC\u2019s investigation is expected to be published early next week.",

She became the first British woman to win a global sprint title with a dominant display in Doha, charging home in 21.88sec to take gold and break her own national record in the process. It was her second medal of these championships to go with her silver in the 100m. But when the 23-year-old was asked whether it meant she was the finished article, she shook her head. \u201cThe Olympics is less than a year away so we\u2019ve already been thinking about it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut my coach John Blackie and I still have some things to work on. In the 100m I didn\u2019t run the race I planned. I am still getting stronger and more experience physically and mentally. So hopefully there is more to come and it should be an exciting journey.\u201d Asher-Smith\u2019s victory has propelled her into the stratosphere of British sport but afterwards she promised global success would not change her. \u201cNot really because being an athlete is very humbling anyway,\u201d she said. \u201cI train six days a week and I am still going to push myself to the limit.

Tygart told the German TV channel ZDF: \u201cYou must understand that the athletes really had no idea what was going on with them, what was being given to them. What dosage, whether the methods were forbidden or not, they didn\u2019t even know.</p> <p>\u201cAn athlete was even told she needed medication for a myoma [a tumour of the uterus], even though she didn\u2019t have a myoma at all.

They were simply sent to the doctor and told they must listen to and trust him.\u201d</p> <p>Tygart confirmed that 10 athletes from the Oregon Project had helped Usada investigators. \u201cAll of them provided us with their medical evaluations. We found out they were fake and false information was added after we officially requested it.</p> <p>\u201cI hope Nike now sees this as a wake-up call. They can\u2019t find any excuses any more, they have to admit that experiments were done on athletes in their name and on their premises, and that was just wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Salazar, who was stripped of his world championships accreditation, continues to deny any wrongdoing and has vowed to appeal. Nike has also backed the coach and said that his four-year ban \u201chad nothing to do with administering banned substances to any Oregon Project athlete\u201d.</p>",

      "bodyText": "UK Athletics is facing calls for an inquiry into how much influence the banned coach Alberto Salazar, who mentored Mo Farah for more than six years, has had on athletes in its endurance programme. The move comes after the US Anti-Doping Agency, who sanctioned Salazar on Tuesday for \u201corchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct\u201d while working with the Nike Oregon Project, said it also had serious concerns about his use of prescription medications on otherwise healthy athletes. One of those is thyroxin, which UK Anti-Doping believes should be banned in elite sport because it has concerns over potential health risks for heart, skeletal muscle, bones, and metabolic pathways, and is now the subject of a Wada critical review. According to the Times, one leading British coach in Doha has written to the UKA hierarchy calling for an investigation into whether such methods were ever employed by staff in charge of the British Athletics team. On Wednesday the Guardian spoke to two elite GB athletes who shared the coach\u2019s concerns. UKA has declined to comment, but before Salazar\u2019s ban its performance director, Neil Black, called him a \u201cgenius\u201d and described his relationship with him as one of \u201ctotal trust, total belief, total respect\u201d. Travis Tygart, the Usada chief executive, has said that athletes under Salazar\u2019s wing were often kept in the dark about the substances they were given and used as \u201claboratory animals\u201d. Tygart told the German TV channel ZDF: \u201cYou must understand that the athletes really had no idea what was going on with them, what was being given to them. What dosage, whether the methods were forbidden or not, they didn\u2019t even know. \u201cAn athlete was even told she needed medication for a myoma [a tumour of the uterus], even though she didn\u2019t have a myoma at all. They lied to the athletes and did their medical experiments on them in the NOP. They were simply sent to the doctor and told they must listen to and trust him.\u201d Tygart confirmed that 10 athletes from the Oregon Project had helped Usada investigators. \u201cAll of them provided us with their medical evaluations. We found out they were fake and false information was added after we officially requested it. \u201cI hope Nike now sees this as a wake-up call. They can\u2019t find any excuses any more, they have to admit that experiments were done on athletes in their name and on their premises, and that was just wrong.\u201d Salazar, who was stripped of his world championships accreditation, continues to deny any wrongdoing and has vowed to appeal. Nike has also backed the coach and said that his four-year ban \u201chad nothing to do with administering banned substances to any Oregon Project athlete\u201d.",

Australia is once again looking at nuclear energy as a potential solution to its power woes, after a group of Coalition MPs, led by a cohort from Queensland, pushed the federal party room into investigating the prospect, through a parliamentary inquiry. But in a move which has surprised their federal counterparts, the Queensland state LNP spokesman for energy, Michael Hart, made a written submission to the inquiry, announcing his arm of the party\u2019s opposition to any attempt to allow nuclear energy generation, citing the risks to the communities and the environment. Instead, Hart said the Queensland LNP supports \u201cgreater focus\u201d on \u201cenergy efficiency measures, along with encouraging investment in renewable energy options like wind and solar, in combination with battery storage when it is technologically and economically feasible to do so\u201d. \u201cIt is considered that Australia\u2019s rich renewable energy resources are more affordable and bring less risk than the elevated cost and risk associated with nuclear energy,\u201d Hart submitted. \u201cThe LNP encourages additional jobs and investment in Queensland\u2019s renewable energy industry, while also supporting resource jobs and exploration which provides baseload power and employment for thousands of Queenslanders. \u201cIn addition to the possibility of accidents and operational failure, nuclear facilities can be a potential target for terrorists. Securing insurance around such possibilities would be virtually impossible. \u201cIn conclusion, the commercial, as well as the political risks, associated with nuclear energy are substantial. To this end, the LNP is strongly committed to an energy policy that delivers safe, affordable and reliable energy to consumers, while fulfilling Australia\u2019s international emissions reduction obligations. \u201cWe believe this can be achieved without lifting the moratorium on nuclear energy generation. Accordingly, we would encourage the committee to ensure an increased emphasis is placed on measures to encourage investment in renewable energy that creates green jobs and lowers electricity bills, for both consumers and industry, which does not (underlined) include nuclear energy\u201d. The state Labor government established a 50% renewable energy target by 2030 upon winning power in 2015. The federal inquiry was established after a group of Coalition MPs, led by Hinkler LNP member Keith Pitt and Queensland LNP senator James McGrath, pushed for an investigation into whether nuclear power should be considered as part of the mix, as the government hunts for a long term solution to Australia\u2019s surging energy prices. Not wanting to reignite the war that led to the downfall of the national energy guarantee, and ultimately, Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s leadership, the government acquiesced to calls for an investigation, which was established after a recommendation from Angus Taylor. The state LNP position stands in stark contrast to their federal colleagues, including conservative senator Amanda Stoker, who said that \u201cAustralia must develop a nuclear energy industry\u201d, as well as her Queensland colleague Gerard Rennick. McGrath has publicly pushed for the nuclear discussion in numerous interviews and his own social media, as well as within the party room. Pitt, who describes himself as \u201ctechnologically agnostic\u201d, said the discussion had to be had. \u201cThe first priority for the nations future energy needs will always be reliability and affordability,\u201d he said. \u201cAs technology changes I expect our energy mix will also change over a period of time. I am completely technology agnostic in terms of the fuel types that might be utilised. Currently Queensland has the country\u2019s youngest fleet of coal fired generators and I expect they will continue to be a critical part of Queensland\u2019s energy mix into the future.\u201d He demurred from any questions on the split between state and federal lines, saying the state arm could \u201cspeak for themselves\u201d, but attacked the state Labor government for its price management of the state owned power assets. But the submission did give Queensland Labor senator, Murray Watt, a late week boost. \u201cThis submission shows the LNP\u2019s state MPs have had enough of their federal counterparts\u2019 pointless culture war against renewable power,\u201d he said. \u201cEven the LNP\u2019s state MPs acknowledge that renewables are a cheaper and safer way of meeting our future energy needs. \u201cThey have also slammed their federal counterparts\u2019 pursuit of nuclear power as a massive waste of time and resources. \u201cThe Queensland LNP\u2019s federal representatives should stop wasting everyone\u2019s time by pursuing their obsession with nuclear power and get behind cheaper and safer means of meeting our energy needs.\u201d",

He says:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The backstop acted as a bridge to a proposed future relationship with the EU in which the UK would be closely integrated with EU customs arrangements and would align with EU law in many areas.

The government intends that the future relationship should be based on a free trade agreement in which the UK takes control of its own regulatory affairs and trade policy. In these circumstances the proposed \u201cbackstop\u201d is a bridge to nowhere, and a new way forward must be found.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson\u2019s plan essentially replaces a UK-wide backstop with a Northern Ireland (NI) only backstop (which is what was originally planned before May proposed the UK-wide one to satisfy the DUP).</strong> Under May\u2019s plan the whole of the UK would have stayed in the customs union, and NI would also have stayed bound by some single market (regulatory) rules. Johnson has reverted to a NI-only model, with two features: Northern Ireland staying in an all-island regulatory zone for goods, meaning a regulatory border down the Irish Sea; but Northern Ireland staying in UK customs territory, meaning a customs border in Ireland.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Northern Ireland would be in an all-island regulatory zone for goods including agrifoods.</strong> In his letter Johnson says:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>For as long as it exists, this zone would eliminate all regulatory checks for trade in goods between Northern Ireland and Ireland by ensuring that goods regulations in Northern Ireland are the same as those in the rest of the EU.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The UK government has accepted that this would involve more checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain. </strong>The explanatory note says:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Building on the existing practice established to maintain the single epidemiological unit (SEU) on the island of Ireland, Northern Ireland would align with EU SPS rules, including those relating to the placing on the market of agri-food goods. Agrifood goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain would do so via a border inspection post or designated point of entry as required by EU law, building on the provisions that already exist to support the SEU. They would be subject to identity and documentary checks and physical examination by UK authorities as required by the relevant EU rules.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The Northern Ireland assembly would have to vote for Northern Ireland to stay in the all-island regulatory zone - before it took effect from January 2021 (when the transition period is due to end) and every four years afterwards.</strong> Johnson says in his letter.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This regulatory zone must depend on the consent of those affected by it. This is essential to the acceptability of arrangements under which part of the UK accepts the rules of a different political entity. It is fundamental to democracy. We are proposing that the Northern Ireland executive and assembly should have the opportunity to endorse those arrangements before they enter into force, that is, during the transition period, and every four years afterwards. If consent is not secured, the arrangements will lapse. The same should apply to the single electricity market, which raises the same principles. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is an essential element of the proposal, but there are at least three potential drawbacks. First, there is no power-sharing executive at the moment, because it has been suspended for nearly three years. Second, this would give the DUP a veto; they would have the power to take NI out of the arrangements. (So would Sinn Fein, but they would not want to do that.) And, third, as the government briefing earlier revealed (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/oct/02/brexit-latest-news-conservative-conference-boris-johnsons-plan-for-alternative-to-backstop-gets-early-frosty-reception-from-eu-live-news?page=with:block-5d94be2c8f081108db9c0f1f#block-5d94be2c8f081108db9c0f1f\">4.16pm),</a> it is not very clear what would happen if the NI assembly did vote to abandon the arrangement. After a year NI would default to \u201cexisting rules\u201d, but that begs the question as to what new arrangements might be needed at the border.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson accepts that goods going between Ireland and Northern Ireland would be subject to customs rules, but he claims there would be no need for checks at or near the border. </strong>In his letter he says:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We are proposing that all customs processes needed to ensure compliance with the UK and EU customs regimes should take place on a decentralised basis, with paperwork conducted electronically as goods move between the two countries, and with the very small number of physical checks needed conducted at traders\u2019 premises or other points on the supply chain. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson has admitted that the details of how these new customs rules would work have yet to be finalised. </strong>In his letter he goes on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>To enable this, we should both put in place specific, workable improvements and simplifications to existing customs rules between now and the end of the transition period, in the spirit of finding flexible and creative solutions to these particular circumstances. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The explanatory note goes even further, saying that although the arrangement would be based on existing customs legislation, the intention would be to amend that legislation. It says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The intention is to make a series of simplifications and improvements to that legislation which will ensure that the commitment in the new protocol to ensure no checks or infrastructure at the border will be fulfilled by the end of the transition period. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This implies the EU would be expected to changes its customs rules to accommodate the UK\u2019s wishes.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>And he has also admitted that the customs arrangements for goods crossing the north/south Irish border would involve some physical checks. </strong>The explanatory note says goods would be imported or exported via a transit mechanism or a prior declaration mechanism. It does on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Under either process the relevant customs authority will be notified that the consignment has entered their customs territory. Either mechanism would link the movement of the consignment over the border with the information provided to the customs authority, which could identify any goods requiring customs interventions. Physical checks \u2013 which would continue to be required only on a very small proportion of movements based on risk assessment \u2013 could then take place at traders\u2019 premises or other designated locations which could be located anywhere in Ireland or Northern Ireland. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The note says there would be no need for checks to take place \u201cat, or even near\u201d the border. But the concern in Ireland is that customs officials and customs centres could become a target for terrorists, wherever they are.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson proposes an investment package for Northern Ireland.</strong> In his letter he writes:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In order to support Northern Ireland through this transition, and in collaboration with others with an interest, this government proposes a New Deal for Northern Ireland, with appropriate commitments to help boost economic growth and Northern Ireland\u2019s competitiveness, and to support infrastructure projects, particularly with a cross-border focus. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>No 10 has not said how much money might be available to NI, but this plan reflects the idea floated by Sajid Javid, the chancellor, when he was a Tory leadership candidate, for <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/uk/brexit-pm-candidate-would-pay-hundreds-of-millions-for-border-solution-1.3919801\">a payout worth hundreds of millions to be used as a means of solving the border problem.</a></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc3ab6d7780a17e9c9c5054960c8d47488a48b83\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc3ab6d7780a17e9c9c5054960c8d47488a48b83/0_192_4893_2936/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson after his conference speech\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson after his conference speech</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/POOL/EPA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-02T16:49:03.193Z\">at 5.49pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d94c8be8f08fbb0c171fa35\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-02T16:02:26.718Z\">5.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Juncker says PM's plan has 'some problematic points' but does not say no, and talks go on</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Boris Johnson has spoken to Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president.

However, the president also noted that there are still some problematic points that will need further work in the coming days, notably with regards to the governance of the backstop. The delicate balance struck by the Good Friday agreement must be preserved. Another concern that needs to be addressed are the substantive customs rules. He also stressed that we must have a legally operational solution that meets all the objectives of the backstop: preventing a hard border, preserving north-south cooperation and the all-island economy, and protecting the EU\u2019s single market and Ireland\u2019s place in it.</p> \n   <p>President Juncker confirmed to Prime Minister Johnson that the commission will now examine the legal text objectively, and in light of our well-known criteria.</p> \n   <p>The EU wants a deal.

I expect him to talk me through the proposals, and for me to ask him to listen to the voice of the people of Northern Ireland. As prime minister he must act with impartiality and listen to all the parties of Northern Ireland, and the people of Northern Ireland, who voted against Brexit and do not want to see customs posts on the border.</p> \n   <p>It will be necessary to have checks, but we believe they should be done at ports and airports, but not along the 500km border.

Why would any British government want to force that on Irish people, north and south? </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Varadkar said he did not hear Boris Johnson deliver his speech this morning. But Varadkar also said this, implying he had read or heard what Johnson had to say about how if the UK and the EU failed to agree that would be because of a \u201ctechnical\u201d disagreement about customs:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It\u2019s much more than technical, it\u2019s deeply political, legal, and the technical aspects are a small part of that.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Although Varadkar\u2019s comments sound negative, here he has just been focusing on the unacceptability of customs checks at or on the border. This may be significant because Johnson is stressing that the checks he envisages would take place elsewhere.

With David Cameron, for example, there was the \u201chug a hoodie\u201d speech that set out his vision for liberal Conservatism, or the 2013 Bloomberg speech that announced a referendum on Europe. The highlights of Theresa May\u2019s career include her \u201cnasty party\u201d speech as Tory chairman, her speech attacking the Police Federation, and her 2016 conference speech as PM setting Britain on course of a hard Brexit. </p> \n  <p>But Boris Johnson is different. He mostly just gives the same speech every time, and we heard it again today \u2013 a jolly confection of jokes meandering around the theme of how Conservatism should be about combining the benefits of a market economy with strong public services, with copious references to his time as London mayor. Even the jokes were old: dispatching Jeremy Corbyn into outer space, SNP leaders having fish surnames, and the line about wind turbines \u2013 although, when Johnson said today that \u201conly a few years ago people were saying that \u2026 wind turbines would not pull the skin off a rice pudding\u201d, he failed to mention that <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/energy/10154424/Wind-farms-couldnt-pull-the-skin-off-a-rice-pudding-says-Boris-Johnson.html\">one of the people using that line was Johnson himself</a>. Essentially, it was just an extended version of one of his Telegraph columns.</p> \n  <p>On the plus side, Johnson\u2019s Telegraph columns were always worth a read; he can deliver an entertaining speech and the whole performance was more enjoyable than having to listen to Theresa May. People respond well to leaders exuding optimism, not misery, and Johnson certainly manages this. He is not so much a glass half-full sort of person as a glass full-to-overflowing.</p> \n  <p>But, on the down side, was there any substance to support this inverted pyramid of puff? This was not a speech that made any sort of serious argument about the challenges facing the country, and it did not have anything new to say about domestic policy at all. Surprisingly, given that an election is expected soon, it did not even try to make a very robust case as to why the country would be better off for the next five years under the Conservatives, beyond claiming that Labour would prolong Brexit \u201cchaos\u201d (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/oct/02/brexit-latest-news-conservative-conference-boris-johnsons-plan-for-alternative-to-backstop-gets-early-frosty-reception-from-eu-live-news?page=with:block-5d947c508f08fbb0c171f60e#block-5d947c508f08fbb0c171f60e\">11.33am)</a> \u2013 a claim, that in the current circumstances, you would have thought the Tories might have thought twice about wanting to revive.</p> \n  <p>The most important passage was probably the one summarising Johnson\u2019s Brexit offer to the EU.

Previously he had put the chances at 25%. He thinks there is now an 80% chance of an election, and a 10% chance of no deal.</p> \n  <p>Here is an extract from his briefing.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>London admits that Boris has scrapped Theresa May\u2019s pledge that there could be no border \u201cinfrastructure\u201d or \u201crelated checks and controls\u201d. But government sources are adamant that its final proposals will mean \u201cno new infrastructure anywhere\u201d. However, they admit the UK is still pursuing minimal, non-intrusive \u201cbehind-the-border checks\u201d using \u201cexisting processes and greater market-surveillance cooperation.\u201d</p> \n   <p>They hope the UK blueprint will be good enough to persuade EU to enter the negotiating \u201ctunnel\u201d in the run-up to the European council, without further leaks that could scupper a deal. Remarkably, one senior minister said: \u201cIt will be better than they [the EU] expect \u2026 The hope is that both sides then move in concert and we get over the line.\u201d Johnson wants to keep the Democratic Unionist party onboard and some ministers believe that could yet lead to the re-emergence of an old idea \u2013 time-limit to the backstop\u2013 to pave a way for a deal. Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, has signalled possible support for the move. However, the Irish remain opposed to a time-limit, while the Irish and Brussels\u2019 reception to the government\u2019s plans so far has been very hostile \u2026</p> \n   <p>In Brussels, there remain grave doubts about whether Boris is serious about a deal. Indeed, the row over the leaked plan could be seen as the start of the \u201cblame game\u201d that would follow a failure to reach agreement. In Johnson\u2019s planned \u201cpeople versus parliament\u201d election, Brussels is cast in a \u201cbad guy\u201d role alongside MPs. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-02T08:45:06.445Z\">at 9.45am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d945dd88f081108db9c0a58\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-02T08:21:58.875Z\">9.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This is what <strong>Patrick O\u2019Donovan</strong>, an Irish government minister, told BBC Newsnight last night about the UK government\u2019s plans for an alternative to the backstop, as reported by the Telegraph.

This week he has sounded desperate to talk about almost anything other than Brexit, and the Tories have been meticulously preparing a domestic policy agenda intended to neutralise Labour attack lines ahead of a general election. (They have even been banging on about bus services, which must be a first for any Conservative party conference \u2013 a belated recognition that Jeremy Corbyn has correctly identified this as an issue that is very important to voters outside London.) But the speech coincides with the latest Brexit talks with the EU coming to a head, with the government expected this afternoon to publish its plan for an alternative to the backstop.</p> \n  <p>As we report in our overnight story, the plan seems to involve <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland\">Northern Ireland</a> staying under EU single market regulations for agri-food and manufactured goods until at least 2025, but not in the customs union.

      "bodyText": "I am going to wrap the blog up now. Here\u2019s a recap of today\u2019s events. The British government published new proposals for a withdrawal agreement and sent it to the EU Brexit negotiators, who reacted frostily to the new ideas for a backstop in Northern Ireland. The DUP, some hardline-Brexiter members of the European Research Group and a handful of Labour MPs have said they could support the proposal if the EU agreed to make it the basis of a new withdrawal agreement deal. Sinn Fein and opposition parties criticised the plans. Prime minister Boris Johnson said in a speech at the Tory party conference the proposal was a \u201cfair and reasonable compromise\u201d, but reiterated that not accepting these proposals would inevitably result in a no deal exit from the bloc, and said he would not seek another extension. European leaders said they were carefully examining the proposals, and the European Commission agreed to further talks. But the Irish PM Leo Varadkar said the proposals \u201cdo not fully meet agreed objective of the backstop\u201d.\u201d SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said the PM\u2019s plan was \u201cdesigned to fail\u201d. Downing Street No 10 confirmed it will seek another prorogation of parliament next Tuesday, ahead of a Queen\u2019s Speech on October 14, which is expected to be compatible with the recent Supreme Court ruling about the last prorogation, which was ruled to have been \u201cunlawful\u201d. That\u2019s all from me, goodnight. Nicola Sturgeon told Peston what she thinks of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s stance on a second referendum, as far as she can \u201cwork out what it is\u201d: Asked by Robert Peston how the UK is going to leave on October 31, Michael Gove said: \u201cThe most important thing about bridges is that you cross them when you come to them.\u201d Asked whether he was part of Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201cinner circle\u201d, and privy to conversations about leaving without an extension at the end of the month, Gove said: \u201cThe conversations I have with the PM are confidential.\u201d This from Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall: The Conservative MP John Whittingdale just told Peston that he hopes the EU will accept the proposals and that it was a \u201cserious\u201d one. The Labour MP Melanie Onn said she would, if confronted with the choice of a no deal Brexit and this deal, vote for the deal. The Lib Dem MP Sarah Wollaston said the proposal was \u201cplain games from Boris Johnson\u201d and that he didn\u2019t have the numbers to get it through parliament. Michael Gove told Peston \u201cnobody\u201d wanted a no deal outcome, including the PM. Steve Baker, the ERG hardline Brexiter who rejected May\u2019s deal three times, has stopped short of telling Emma Barnett on BBC Newsnight outright that he will support Boris Johnson\u2019s new proposals for a withdrawal deal. Baker said the PM had offered \u201ca very dramatic change of destination\u201d with his proposal. \u201cHis model is about [...] a free trade agreement as a destination,\u201d Baker said. \u201cBoris Johnson is not going to choose to extend,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are not going to extend.\u201d When pressed, he said he was not willing to support another extension of even just a few more days and even if that meant a deal would pass parliament. He said he doesn\u2019t \u201cwish to know\u201d how government will manage not seeking another extension despite the stipulations of the Benn bill, but said he had had a number of conversations with ministers who believe they have found a way to circumvent the law. Baker said he was \u201cvery encouraged\u201d by the DUP being on board with the government\u2019s proposals. He also said he was prepared to vote against the deal if it represented \u201cBrexit in name only\u201d, even if that meant having the Tory whip removed. Labour MP Stephen Kinnock has signalled that he might support the PM\u2019s proposals. This from BBC Wales: This from the Daily Mirror\u2019s political editor Pippa Crerar: The MP Mike Gapes, who left the Labour party in February to form what is now known as Change UK - the Independent Group, has described the government\u2019s new withdrawal proposals as a \u201cNo Deal Scam\u201d and a \u201cTrojan Horse\u201d. The Independent\u2019s John Rentoul reports that Michael Gove will tell Peston tonight that he believes the new proposal has \u201cgot a very good chance of getting through\u201d the Commons if the EU accepts it. Guy Verhofstadt, a member of the pro-European Renew Europe group in the EU parliament and chair of the European parliament\u2019s Brexit steering group, said earlier that he would publish a statement tomorrow detailing \u201dwhat is not acceptable\u201d about the PM\u2019s proposals. Buzzfeed\u2019s Alex Wickham reports that aides of the PM have instructed Tory MPs via a memo on how to play the blame game if the EU rejects Johnson\u2019s proposals. An extract of the memo reads: If the EU maintains the position that in effect Northern Ireland is never allowed to leave the Customs Union, then it is impossible to negotiate any deal - in which case there will be checks according to the Commission\u2019s own logic. This will be seen by everybody as a crazy policy. We have offered a compromise to avoid this situation. It ends with a statement hat will infuriate MPs who voted for the Benn bill, which has enshrined in law that the PM must seek another extension if no deal is passed by October 19: Government policy is to oppose any further delay which would be extremely damaging for democratic politics and the economy. The memo also states, however, that the government is \u201cobviously happy to negotiate details\u201d, adding to efforts by No 10 to distance itself from previous assertions that this proposal would be a \u201cfinal\u201d offer. The Labour MP Ruth Smeeth has responded to reports that she and her colleague Gareth Snell would support the PM\u2019s new deal if the EU agreed. Both MPs represent Leave constituencies, but voted against Theresa May\u2019s deal three times. On September 10, a cross-party group of MPs, nicknamed \u201cMPs for a Deal\u201d, was launched in Westminster, aiming to bring back a version of May\u2019s deal for another vote. The group also called on Boris Johnson to put a new deal before MPs by October 14. Both Smeeth and Snell are members, and, like the rest of the group, desperate to avoid a no deal exit. When May\u2019s deal failed to pass parliament for the third time on March 29, only five Labour MP\u2019s supported it. Stephen Kinnock, also a member of MPs for a Deal, claimed last month that up to 50 Labour MPs could back a deal at the next opportunity. My colleague Heather Stewart has written a piece on Labour\u2019s reaction to Boris Johnson\u2019s proposal, in which she quotes shadow chancellor John McDonnell calling the PM\u2019s plans \u201ca cynical attempt to force through a no-deal Brexit\u201d. DUP leader Arlene Foster on why her party would support the PM\u2019s proposed new deal: Here an interesting tweet from Labour peer Stewart Wood on a clever rewording of \u201ccustoms clearance centres\u201d from the government. Only yesterday, Boris Johnson had said that customs clearance centres would not be part of the government\u2019s new withdrawal agreement proposals. As expected, Boris Johnson is being accused of trying to avoid parliamentary scrutiny by proroguing parliament again, in this instance by Labour MP Liz McInnes: Labour MP Hillary Benn has sharply criticised the PM\u2019s proposals, and told Channel 4 that he does not think the plan upholds the principles of the Good Friday agreement. This from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg on the reaction of Leo Varadkar to the proposals: The Labour MPs Ruth Smeeth and Gareth Snell have expressed support for Boris Johnson\u2019s new withdrawal deal proposals, provided it would ever reach the Commons for a vote. This from the BBC\u2019s Nicholas Watt: And this just in from the BBC\u2019s Katya Adler, on reactions of EU leaders to the new proposals and possible developments over the comings days and weeks: The BBC\u2019s economics editor Faisal Islam has made an important point about the PM\u2019s new withdrawal proposals and has flagged up that the government explicitly states in the new text that there is \u201cno need\u201d for a \u201clevel playing field\u201d between the UK and the EU - a point that carried significance in previous negotiations, particularly in regard to the future relationship between the UK and the Euro bloc. My colleagues Richard Partington and Rob Davies have written a story about the potentially \u201csevere\u201d damage the PM\u2019s new backstop proposals could inflict on Northern Ireland\u2019s economy. Meanwhile, the Domestic Abuse Bill has passed its second reading in parliament without a vote, unanimously supported by MPs. A carry over motion was passed to ensure the bill does not collapse if parliament is prorogued again next week. This from Jess Phillips MP: This from Brigid Fowler, senior researcher at the Hansard Society: For those of you wondering what the implications of another prorogation of parliament would be - it\u2019s not entirely clear at this point. What is for certain is that the Supreme Court judgment that ruled the last prorogation unlawful did not preclude the possibility of another, shorter prorogation, a detail the government is leaning on now. Another prorogation on Tuesday would get the PM out of PMQs, which he will surely be criticised for by MPs. This from ITV\u2019s Robert Peston: Here the full statement of Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar following a call with Boris Johnson: The Taoiseach and the UK Prime Minister, Boris Johnson spoke by phone this evening, shortly before 6pm. They discussed the latest proposals from the UK. The Taoiseach said the proposals do not fully meet the agreed objectives of the backstop. However, he indicated that he would study them in further detail, and would consult with the EU institutions, including the Task Force and our EU partners. The Taoiseach expects to speak with European Council President Donald Tusk, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, and with other EU heads of Government over the coming days. This will include the Swedish and Danish Prime Ministers, with whom the Taoiseach has bilateral meetings on Thursday and Friday in their capitals. The Taoiseach said he wants to see a deal agreed and ratified, and will continue to work in unity with our EU partners to this end. The Taoiseach and the Prime Minister agreed they would speak again next week. This just in from my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll, the Guardian\u2019s Brexit correspondent: Here the full statement of MSP and Constitutional Affairs secretary Michael Russell, in response to Boris Johnson\u2019s latest Brexit proposals to the EU. (It echoes remarks Nicola Sturgeon made earlier this afternoon.) It looks like these proposals are designed to fail and that the UK Government is intent on pursuing a \u2018no deal\u2019. This plan does not appear to be a serious basis for negotiation. The UK Government is pulling back from previous undertakings and demanding the EU makes concessions on its fundamental principles, which it will not accept. The number one priority now is to find a way to stop the disastrous \u2018no deal\u2019 outcome which the UK Government has demonstrated it favours. The proposals published today also show that in the longer-term the UK Government wants a much more distant relationship with the EU with all the damage to jobs and living standards that will bring. No 10 Downing Street has just confirmed that the government will seek another prorogation of parliament next Tuesday ahead of a new Queen\u2019s Speech on October 14. Here the statement in full: The Prime Minister has been consistently clear that he wants to set out a fresh legislative programme in a Queen\u2019s Speech. He therefore intends to request that the current session of Parliament be prorogued from the evening of Tuesday 8 October, with a Queen\u2019s Speech on Monday 14 October. The Government will seek to strengthen public services, improve infrastructure and connectivity across the country, tackle crime and enhance the integrity of the criminal justice system, while protecting our natural environment for the long-term. The Prime Minister has today set out a fair and reasonable compromise for replacing the backstop and securing the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union with a deal. If a deal can be agreed at European Council, a central feature of the legislative programme will be to introduce a Withdrawal Agreement Bill and move at pace to secure its passage before 31 October. These timings would mean Parliament is prorogued for the shortest time possible to enable all the necessary logistical preparations for a State Opening to be undertaken, including those done by the House Authorities. Prime minister Boris Johnson said: I want to deliver on the people\u2019s priorities. Through a Queen\u2019s Speech, the government will set out its plans for the NHS, schools, tackling crime, investing in infrastructure and building a strong economy. We will get Brexit done on 31 October and continue delivering on these vital issues. Hello everyone. I\u2019ll be gathering some reactions to the plans for a new withdrawal agreement the British government has set out this afternoon. While the DUP and the ERG\u2019s hardline Brexiters, many of whom have voted down Theresa May\u2019s deal three times, seem prepared to support Boris Johnson\u2019s proposals, others are voicing scepticism. This from the BBC\u2019s Nick Eardley, who quotes Michael Russell here, member of the Scottish parliament for Argyll &amp; Bute: Downing Street has confirmed that Boris Johnson has spoken to Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, and Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach (PM) about his plan this after. He is due to hold further talks with his EU counterparts in the coming days. That\u2019s all from me for today. My colleague Jedidajah Otte is taking over now. Here is the Guardian\u2019s Politics Weekly podcast, with Rowena Mason, Heather Stewart, Lisa O\u2019Carroll, Peter Walker, Kate Andrews and Ryan Shorthouse in Manchester talking about Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit offer to the EU, the Tory announcements at their conference, and what\u2019s been happening in parliament. This is from Manfred Weber, the German MEP who heads the centre-right EPP group in the European parliament. Raoul Ruparel, an adviser to Theresa May on Europe when she was PM, has posted a useful Twitter thread on Boris Johnson\u2019s plan that starts here. And here is his conclusion. Boris Johnson\u2019s plan for an alternative to the backstop is set out in two documents that have been published - his four-page letter to Jean-Claude Juncker (pdf) and a seven-page explanatory note (pdf). There is also a legal text, but that has not been published. Here are the main points. Johnson has backed away from claims that this is a final, take-it-or-leave-it offer to the EU. No 10 was briefing this line last night, and some ministers used the term \u201cfinal offer\u201d. (See 10am.) But Johnson did not use this language in his conference speech. (See 12.56pm.) And in his letter to Juncker Johnson strongly hints that further changes might be acceptable. He says: This letter sets out what I regard as a reasonable compromise: the broad landing zone in which I believe a deal can begin to take shape. Johnson admits that his overall plan for Brexit is different to Theresa May\u2019s, and that he wants the UK to end up less aligned to the EU than she proposed. He often implies that the only thing he disliked about her deal was the backstop. But in his letter to Juncker he says, more explicitly than he usually does, that the argument about the backstop is also an argument about Brexit\u2019s final destination. He says: The backstop acted as a bridge to a proposed future relationship with the EU in which the UK would be closely integrated with EU customs arrangements and would align with EU law in many areas. That proposed future relationship is not the goal of the current UK government. The government intends that the future relationship should be based on a free trade agreement in which the UK takes control of its own regulatory affairs and trade policy. In these circumstances the proposed \u201cbackstop\u201d is a bridge to nowhere, and a new way forward must be found. Johnson\u2019s plan essentially replaces a UK-wide backstop with a Northern Ireland (NI) only backstop (which is what was originally planned before May proposed the UK-wide one to satisfy the DUP). Under May\u2019s plan the whole of the UK would have stayed in the customs union, and NI would also have stayed bound by some single market (regulatory) rules. Johnson has reverted to a NI-only model, with two features: Northern Ireland staying in an all-island regulatory zone for goods, meaning a regulatory border down the Irish Sea; but Northern Ireland staying in UK customs territory, meaning a customs border in Ireland. Northern Ireland would be in an all-island regulatory zone for goods including agrifoods. In his letter Johnson says: For as long as it exists, this zone would eliminate all regulatory checks for trade in goods between Northern Ireland and Ireland by ensuring that goods regulations in Northern Ireland are the same as those in the rest of the EU. The UK government has accepted that this would involve more checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain. The explanatory note says: Building on the existing practice established to maintain the single epidemiological unit (SEU) on the island of Ireland, Northern Ireland would align with EU SPS rules, including those relating to the placing on the market of agri-food goods. Agrifood goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain would do so via a border inspection post or designated point of entry as required by EU law, building on the provisions that already exist to support the SEU. They would be subject to identity and documentary checks and physical examination by UK authorities as required by the relevant EU rules. The Northern Ireland assembly would have to vote for Northern Ireland to stay in the all-island regulatory zone - before it took effect from January 2021 (when the transition period is due to end) and every four years afterwards. Johnson says in his letter. This regulatory zone must depend on the consent of those affected by it. This is essential to the acceptability of arrangements under which part of the UK accepts the rules of a different political entity. It is fundamental to democracy. We are proposing that the Northern Ireland executive and assembly should have the opportunity to endorse those arrangements before they enter into force, that is, during the transition period, and every four years afterwards. If consent is not secured, the arrangements will lapse. The same should apply to the single electricity market, which raises the same principles. This is an essential element of the proposal, but there are at least three potential drawbacks. First, there is no power-sharing executive at the moment, because it has been suspended for nearly three years. Second, this would give the DUP a veto; they would have the power to take NI out of the arrangements. (So would Sinn Fein, but they would not want to do that.) And, third, as the government briefing earlier revealed (see 4.16pm), it is not very clear what would happen if the NI assembly did vote to abandon the arrangement. After a year NI would default to \u201cexisting rules\u201d, but that begs the question as to what new arrangements might be needed at the border. Johnson accepts that goods going between Ireland and Northern Ireland would be subject to customs rules, but he claims there would be no need for checks at or near the border. In his letter he says: We are proposing that all customs processes needed to ensure compliance with the UK and EU customs regimes should take place on a decentralised basis, with paperwork conducted electronically as goods move between the two countries, and with the very small number of physical checks needed conducted at traders\u2019 premises or other points on the supply chain. Johnson has admitted that the details of how these new customs rules would work have yet to be finalised. In his letter he goes on: To enable this, we should both put in place specific, workable improvements and simplifications to existing customs rules between now and the end of the transition period, in the spirit of finding flexible and creative solutions to these particular circumstances. The explanatory note goes even further, saying that although the arrangement would be based on existing customs legislation, the intention would be to amend that legislation. It says: The intention is to make a series of simplifications and improvements to that legislation which will ensure that the commitment in the new protocol to ensure no checks or infrastructure at the border will be fulfilled by the end of the transition period. This implies the EU would be expected to changes its customs rules to accommodate the UK\u2019s wishes. And he has also admitted that the customs arrangements for goods crossing the north/south Irish border would involve some physical checks. The explanatory note says goods would be imported or exported via a transit mechanism or a prior declaration mechanism. It does on: Under either process the relevant customs authority will be notified that the consignment has entered their customs territory. Either mechanism would link the movement of the consignment over the border with the information provided to the customs authority, which could identify any goods requiring customs interventions. Physical checks \u2013 which would continue to be required only on a very small proportion of movements based on risk assessment \u2013 could then take place at traders\u2019 premises or other designated locations which could be located anywhere in Ireland or Northern Ireland. The note says there would be no need for checks to take place \u201cat, or even near\u201d the border. But the concern in Ireland is that customs officials and customs centres could become a target for terrorists, wherever they are. Johnson proposes an investment package for Northern Ireland. In his letter he writes: In order to support Northern Ireland through this transition, and in collaboration with others with an interest, this government proposes a New Deal for Northern Ireland, with appropriate commitments to help boost economic growth and Northern Ireland\u2019s competitiveness, and to support infrastructure projects, particularly with a cross-border focus. No 10 has not said how much money might be available to NI, but this plan reflects the idea floated by Sajid Javid, the chancellor, when he was a Tory leadership candidate, for a payout worth hundreds of millions to be used as a means of solving the border problem. Boris Johnson has spoken to Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president. Juncker has not rejected the PM\u2019s plan outright, and in fact he has welcomed some aspects Here is an extract from the commission\u2019s statement about the talks. President Juncker welcomed Prime Minister Johnson\u2019s determination to advance the talks ahead of the October European Council and make progress towards a deal. He acknowledged the positive advances, notably with regards to the full regulatory alignment for all goods and the control of goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain. However, the president also noted that there are still some problematic points that will need further work in the coming days, notably with regards to the governance of the backstop. The delicate balance struck by the Good Friday agreement must be preserved. Another concern that needs to be addressed are the substantive customs rules. He also stressed that we must have a legally operational solution that meets all the objectives of the backstop: preventing a hard border, preserving north-south cooperation and the all-island economy, and protecting the EU\u2019s single market and Ireland\u2019s place in it. President Juncker confirmed to Prime Minister Johnson that the commission will now examine the legal text objectively, and in light of our well-known criteria. The EU wants a deal. We remain united and ready to work 24/7 to make this happen \u2013 as we have been for over three years now. The UK and EU negotiating teams will meet in Brussels over the coming days. From the Times\u2019 Steven Swinford John Redwood is one of the 28 Tory Brexiters who voted against Theresa May\u2019s deal on all three occasions. And here is Jeremy Corbyn telling the BBC that the proposal is \u201cworse than Theresa May\u2019s deal\u201d. A government official said Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan would create a single regulatory zone across Ireland for goods but not services \u2013 a suggestion that was previously rejected by the DUP. The major difference between the new arrangements and the backstop is that there will now be a mechanism for consent allowing both the NI executive and assembly to endorse those arrangements, the official said. Asked what would happen in regards to the border and border checks if Northern Ireland\u2019s democratic institutions voted to end regulatory alignment with the EU, the official said: \u201cThat\u2019s a discussion we will have closer to the time.\u201d The prime minister does not intend to extend the transition period but did not rule it out, the official said. Crucially, the official was unable to say what would happen if Stormont or the executive rejects the new arrangements. It says in the documents that \u201cif consent is withheld the arrangements will not enter into force or will lapse (as the case may be) after one year and arrangements will default to existing rules\u201d. The official also conceded that the deal could involve another tranche of money going to Northern Ireland. Asked about the mention of a \u201cNew Deal for Northern Ireland\u201d mentioned in Johnson\u2019s letter, the official said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t dispute that the support is likely to have financial implications.\u201d Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, thinks Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan is \u201cdesigned to fail\u201d. From ITV\u2019s Robert Peston. Jeremy Corbyn has told Sky News he thinks Boris Johnson\u2019s proposal does not make it clear how the Good Friday agreement would be supported. He also said it was \u201cworse\u201d than Theresa May\u2019s proposal because it envisaged the UK diverging more from EU regulation. He says Boris Johnson should come to the Commons tomorrow to explain his plan. He said Labour would be telling him the plan was \u201cnot acceptable\u201d. A DUP source said the main shift in the party\u2019s position was not just its decision to accept a time-limited revised backstop, but that at the end of 2024 the process was \u201copt in\u201d for the region rather than \u201copt out\u201d. This is because the Stormont executive and assembly will have a say on whether Northern Ireland stays in regulatory alignment with the EU/Ireland rules. \u201cIt\u2019s basically back to the joint report,\u201d said the source in a reference to the December 2017 deal (pdf) between the UK and the EU, which created a backstop for the border in the event of no deal but at the same time guaranteed no barriers between the region and GB unless Stormont agreed. According to a blogpost from Channel 4 News\u2019 political editor, Gary Gibbon, Boris Johnson and his team are not hugely optimistic about the prospects of the EU agreeing to the No 10 plan. It is worth reading the whole thing, but here\u2019s an extract. The word from EU sources is that the new proposal doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s going to make it into the famed \u201ctunnel\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s the secret, detailed negotiating format reserved for EU endgame negotiations. Instead there could be exploratory talks checking out how hard the UK lines are. Everyone is mindful of the blame game that will swiftly follow if talks fail and wants to minimise their exposure. Simon Coveney has already today said on behalf of the Irish government that what they\u2019ve seen doesn\u2019t look like good news for the chances of a deal (Dublin was briefed yesterday by Sir Ed Lister, Boris Johnson\u2019s adviser alongside No 10 recruit Prof John Bew, Attlee\u2019s biographer) \u2026 Visitors to the executive suites floor of the Midland hotel in Manchester, where the government\u2019s top people held court this week, have been told there is already an expectation that we will soon be in the next phase of this crisis: Boris Johnson refusing to sign the letter requesting a Brexit delay as required by the Benn act. No 10 sources say that they then expect that issue to go to the high court on 21 October and the supreme court a couple of days later. (The government\u2019s favoured date for a general election is said to be 28 November \u2013 there is \u201ca real keenness\u201d not to have an election in December, No 10 sources have said.) The Financial Times\u2019 George Parker thinks the DUP might not have read the government\u2019s plans properly. The full text of the DUP statement (see 3.25pm) is here. And here is an extract. The DUP has always indicated that the United Kingdom must leave the EU as one nation and in so doing that no barriers to trade are erected within the UK. This offer provides a basis for the EU to continue in a serious and sustained engagement with the UK government without risk to the internal market of the United Kingdom. It will require changes to the draft withdrawal treaty and we welcome the fact that all sides now recognise that requirement in order to secure agreement. These proposals would ensure that Northern Ireland would be out of the EU customs union and the single market as with the rest of the United Kingdom ... Further work remains to be completed between the UK and the European Union but we would encourage all concerned to approach these discussions in a positive mind-set within a spirit of wanting to secure a negotiated withdrawal agreement that can allow everyone to focus on future relationships. For our part that is the manner in which we will approach these issues over the coming period. The DUP has just issued this statement. It is provisionally welcoming the plan, while stressing that \u201cfurther work\u201d remains to be done. From the BBC\u2019s Adam Fleming. From the BBC\u2019s Europe editor Katya Adler. Here is the full text (pdf) of Boris Johnson\u2019s letter to Jean-Claude Juncker explaining the details of his plan. And here is a seven-page explanatory note (pdf) from the government. Here is Boris Johnson\u2019s letter to Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, explaining the plans. The government has just published its plan. The absence of a \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d demand in Boris Johnson\u2019s conference speech has offered some hope in Brussels of a prime ministerial U-turn on what EU officials have described as unworkable proposals for the Irish border, my colleague Daniel Boffey reports. From the BBC\u2019s Jenny Hill Boris Johnson is due to speaking to the European commission Jean-Claude Juncker about his Brexit proposals at around 4.15pm this afternoon. David Frost, the PM\u2019s Brexit adviser, is also having talks with the EU\u2019s Brexit negotiating team. Earlier Mina Andreeva, the commission\u2019s chief spokeswoman, said: We understand that we will receive a text from the United Kingdom later today and once received we will examine it objectively and in light of our well-known criteria. We will listen very carefully to the United Kingdom. Andreeva said she would not \u201cpre-empt any reaction\u201d from the EU before senior figures had a chance to study the details. Speaking at a briefing she said: We want to enter into constructive discussions, so I will certainly not pre-empt any reaction here before even having received the text. The EU wants a deal. We think an orderly withdrawal is far more preferable than a no-deal scenario. And in order for there to be a deal, we must have a legally operable solution that meets all the objectives of the backstop preventing a hard border, preserving the north-south co-operation and the all-Ireland economy, and protecting the EU\u2019s single market and Ireland\u2019s place in it. Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach (prime minister) has said what he has heard about the UK\u2019s Brexit plans is \u201cnot promising\u201d and \u201cdoes not appear to form the basis for an agreement\u201d. He said: What I can say is from the leaks, it\u2019s not promising, and does not appear to form the basis for an agreement, but we\u2019ll keep talking but I\u2019d want to see them in writing first. I hope to speak to the prime minister later this evening. I expect him to talk me through the proposals, and for me to ask him to listen to the voice of the people of Northern Ireland. As prime minister he must act with impartiality and listen to all the parties of Northern Ireland, and the people of Northern Ireland, who voted against Brexit and do not want to see customs posts on the border. It will be necessary to have checks, but we believe they should be done at ports and airports, but not along the 500km border. That\u2019s our position and makes sense to us. No one on the island of Ireland wants checks at the border. Why would any British government want to force that on Irish people, north and south? Varadkar said he did not hear Boris Johnson deliver his speech this morning. But Varadkar also said this, implying he had read or heard what Johnson had to say about how if the UK and the EU failed to agree that would be because of a \u201ctechnical\u201d disagreement about customs: It\u2019s much more than technical, it\u2019s deeply political, legal, and the technical aspects are a small part of that. Although Varadkar\u2019s comments sound negative, here he has just been focusing on the unacceptability of customs checks at or on the border. This may be significant because Johnson is stressing that the checks he envisages would take place elsewhere. (See 11.52am.) From RTE Boris Johnson\u2019s father, Stanley, did not get the embrace he was expecting from his son after the speech, this clip shows. Bloomberg\u2019s Robert Hutton thinks Stanley might have been getting the Falstaff treatment. This is what PA Media has filed about PMQs, which featured Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, standing in for the PM, and Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, standing in for the leader of the opposition. Tory MPs need to learn how to treat women \u201cless cruelly\u201d, Diane Abbott has claimed during a landmark PMQs The shadow home secretary raised the issue of abuse aimed at MPs, abortion rights in Northern Ireland, the so-called \u201crape clause\u201d connected to tax credits and the plight of workers at Thomas Cook, before accusing the government of letting women down. Her appearance at the dispatch box meant she became the first black person to lead their party at PMQs. She faced Dominic Raab at the session, with the pair deputising for their leaders as Boris Johnson was delivering his keynote speech at the Conservative conference in Manchester. Their exchanges included lighthearted moments, too, as Raab initially got to his feet too early after believing Abbott had finished her first question. Abbott later tried to ask a seventh question \u2013 one beyond the allotted six \u2013 before being stopped by the Speaker, John Bercow. The MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington began by asking Raab to apologise for remarks made by the Johnson last week after he said \u201chumbug\u201d in response to concerns raised by Labour\u2019s Paula Sherriff about threats received by MPs. Abbott added Sherriff had received \u201cfour further death threats\u201d since her exchange with the PM, noting some again quoted Johnson\u2019s words. Raab did not apologise on behalf of the PM but called for a \u201czero-tolerance\u201d approach to any abuse or threats against MPs. Abbott also highlighted billboards put up in Walthamstow, east London, targeting the Labour MP Stella Creasy for her support of decriminalising abortion in Northern Ireland. Abbott later said: \u201cWhether it\u2019s women members in this house, women claiming benefits, women\u2019s reproductive rights in Northern Ireland, and the failure to support women workers at Thomas Cook, isn\u2019t this a government letting women down?\u201d Raab replied: \u201cOn this side of the house we\u2019re proud to be on our second female prime minister.\u201d And here is some comment on Boris Johnson\u2019s speech from journalists and commentators. From the BBC\u2019s Nick Robinson. From the Daily Mirror\u2019s Jason Beattie. From Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall. From ITV\u2019s Robert Peston. From the Manchester Evening News\u2019 Jennifer Williams. From the Guardian\u2019s Rafael Behr. From HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh. From Good Morning Britain\u2019s Piers Morgan. From the Guardian\u2019s Gaby Hinsliff. From the Telegraph\u2019s Peter Foster. From the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn. From Politico Europe\u2019s Emilio Casalicchio. From the BBC\u2019s Nick Eardley. Most senior politicians take speech-giving seriously, and important moments in their careers are defined by the speeches they gave at the time. With David Cameron, for example, there was the \u201chug a hoodie\u201d speech that set out his vision for liberal Conservatism, or the 2013 Bloomberg speech that announced a referendum on Europe. The highlights of Theresa May\u2019s career include her \u201cnasty party\u201d speech as Tory chairman, her speech attacking the Police Federation, and her 2016 conference speech as PM setting Britain on course of a hard Brexit. But Boris Johnson is different. He mostly just gives the same speech every time, and we heard it again today \u2013 a jolly confection of jokes meandering around the theme of how Conservatism should be about combining the benefits of a market economy with strong public services, with copious references to his time as London mayor. Even the jokes were old: dispatching Jeremy Corbyn into outer space, SNP leaders having fish surnames, and the line about wind turbines \u2013 although, when Johnson said today that \u201conly a few years ago people were saying that \u2026 wind turbines would not pull the skin off a rice pudding\u201d, he failed to mention that one of the people using that line was Johnson himself. Essentially, it was just an extended version of one of his Telegraph columns. On the plus side, Johnson\u2019s Telegraph columns were always worth a read; he can deliver an entertaining speech and the whole performance was more enjoyable than having to listen to Theresa May. People respond well to leaders exuding optimism, not misery, and Johnson certainly manages this. He is not so much a glass half-full sort of person as a glass full-to-overflowing. But, on the down side, was there any substance to support this inverted pyramid of puff? This was not a speech that made any sort of serious argument about the challenges facing the country, and it did not have anything new to say about domestic policy at all. Surprisingly, given that an election is expected soon, it did not even try to make a very robust case as to why the country would be better off for the next five years under the Conservatives, beyond claiming that Labour would prolong Brexit \u201cchaos\u201d (see 11.33am) \u2013 a claim, that in the current circumstances, you would have thought the Tories might have thought twice about wanting to revive. The most important passage was probably the one summarising Johnson\u2019s Brexit offer to the EU. (See 11.52am.) In a line that sounded desperate, or mildly threatening, Johnson suggested that if the EU rejected his plan, that would just be a \u201ctechnical\u201d matter relating to \u201cthe exact nature of future customs checks\u201d. Doubtless EU leaders will see it very differently. But they might take some consolation from the fact that, although No 10 was briefing last night that the plan being put forward today would be the UK\u2019s \u201cfinal offer\u201d, Johnson did not use those words in his speech. Boris Johnson is now leaving the conference hall. He is shaking hands on the way out. Carrie Symonds, his partner, joined him on the way out, but she did not take to the stage. Johnson is now on his peroration. This country has long been a pioneer. We inaugurated the steam age, the atomic age, the age of the genome. We led the way in parliamentary democracy, in female emancipation. And when the whole world had succumbed to a different fashion, this country and this party pioneered ideas of free markets and privatisation that spread across the planet. Every one of them was controversial, every one of them was difficult, but we have always had the courage to be original, to do things differently, and now we are about to take another giant step to do something no one thought we could do. To reboot our politics, to relaunch ourselves into the world, and to dedicate ourselves again to that simple proposition that we are here to serve the democratic will of the British people. And if we do that with optimism and confidence then I tell you we will not go wrong. Let\u2019s get on with sensible moderate one nation but tax-cutting Tory government, and figuratively if not literally, let us send Jeremy Corbyn into orbit where he belongs. Let\u2019s get Brexit done. Let\u2019s bring our country together. Johnson repeats his attack on Corbyn for wanting to delay Brexit. It has become absolutely clear that he is determined now to frustrate Brexit What do we want and need? Do we want more dither and delay Do we want to spend another billion pounds a month that could be going on the NHS? Let\u2019s get Brexit done Johnson is setting out the choice facing the country at the election. When the chlorinated chickens waddle from the hencoop where they are hiding, that is the vision of the country that we will put to the people. And the choice is clear. We put up wages \u2013 with the biggest expansion of the living wage for a generation; Corbyn would put up taxes for everyone. We back our superb armed forces around the world; Corbyn has said he wants them disbanded. We want an Australian-style points based system for immigration; Corbyn says he doesn\u2019t even believe in immigration controls. If Jeremy Corbyn were allowed into Downing Street, he would whack up your taxes, he would foul up the economy, he would rip up the alliance between Britain and the USA, and he would break up the UK. We cannot allow it to happen. Johnson turns to life after Brexit. We can ban the shipment of live animals. And yes, we will have those free trade deals. We already have some astonishing exports. Just in the last few months I have seen an Isle of Wight shipbuilder that exports vast leisure catamarans to Mexico. We export Jason Donovan CDs to North Korea. We exported Nigel Farage to America \u2013 though he seems to have come back. And across the world there are countries that are yearning to engage with us. Johnson jokes about the SNP too. We will take back control of our fisheries and the extraordinary marine wealth of Scotland. And it is one of the many bizarre features of the SNP that in spite of being called names like Salmond and Sturgeon they are committed to handing back those fish to the control of the EU. We want to turbo-charge the Scottish fishing sector; they would allow Brussels to charge for our turbot. This leads to a joke about Jeremy Corbyn We are building two space ports, one in Sutherland and one in Newquay. Soon we will be sending missions to the heavens \u2013 geostationary satellites. Conference, can you think of anyone who could trial the next mission? Can you think which communist cosmonaut to coax into the cockpit? Johnson turns this into an argument about confidence. I do not for one moment doubt the patriotism of people on all sides of this Brexit argument but I am fed up with being told that our country can\u2019t do something when I believe passionately that it can. Thanks to British technology there is a place in Oxfordshire that could soon be the hottest place in the solar system \u2013 the tokamak fusion reactor in Culham \u2013 and if you go there you will learn that this country has a global lead in fusion research. And that they are on the verge of creating commercially viable miniature fusion reactors for sale around the world, delivering virtually unlimited zero-carbon power. Now I know they have been on the verge for some time. It is a pretty spacious kind of verge. But remember, it was only a few years ago when people were saying that solar power would never work in cloudy old Britain. And that wind turbines would not pull the skin off a rice pudding. Well, there are some days when wind and solar are delivering more than half our energy needs. We can do it. We can beat the sceptics. Johnson says he wants to get more young people on the housing ladder. He urges Tories to back Shaun Bailey, the party\u2019s candidate for London mayor. And he turns to technology. In the West Midlands we are seeing a 21st-century industrial revolution in battery technology. One in five of the electric cars sold in Europe is now made in the UK and that is before we have begun Andy Street\u2019s vision of a West Midlands metro. With infrastructure education and technology we will drive up the productivity of this country and bring it together. Johnson says he wants to expand superfast broadband for the same reason. And it is for exactly the same reason \u2013 to increase connectivity and liveability - that we are putting in gigabit broadband, spreading across the country like tendrils of superinformative vermicelli. Because that is the way to unite the country, to spread opportunity, to bring the country together. Johnson says the government will invest in youth services and in education. Education funding is being levelled up. The government will invest in transport, he says. And he turns to buses. (See 8.46am.) And yes I admit I am a bit of a bus nut. I confess that I like to make and paint inexact models of buses with happy passengers inside. But it is not just because i am a bus nut that we want to expand bus transport with clean, green buses and contactless payment by card or phone. a good bus service can make all the difference to your job. To your life. To your ability to get to the doctor. To the liveability of your town or your village. And to your ability to stay there and have a family there and start a business there. Back in Manchester, Johnson says to spread opportunity the government must keep people safe. We are committing now to rolling up the evil county lines drugs gangs that predate on young kids and send them to die in the streets to feed the cocaine habits of the bourgeoisie and we will succeed. And yes, we will be tough on crime. We will make sure that the police have the legal powers and the political backing to use stop and search because it may be controversial. But believe me that when a young man is going equipped with a bladed weapon there is nothing kinder or more loving or more life-saving you can do than ask him to turn out his pockets. If you want to watch PMQs, there is a live feed here: Johnson says London is a model for a place with \u201cdynamic enterprise culture and great public services\u201d. Johnson says the Tories must speak up for capitalism. How we are going to grow the UK economy. I will tell you that it is by raising the productivity of the whole of the UK not with socialism, not with deranged and ruinous plans borrowed from the playbook of Bolivarian revolutionary Venezuela, but by creating the economic platform for dynamic free-market capitalism. Yes, you heard it right \u2013 capitalism \u2013 and when did you last hear a Tory leader talk about capitalism? We are the party of the NHS precisely because we are the party of capitalism. Johnson says the Tories \u201care the party of the NHS\u201d. In the next 10 years we will build 40 new hospitals in the biggest investment in hospital infrastructure for a generation. Because after 70 years of the existence of the NHS \u2013 44 of them under a Conservative government \u2013 it is time for us to say loud and clear \u2026 We are the party of the NHS. Johnson makes the case for building and refurbishing hospitals. On Monday I went to the North Manchester general hospital and I saw the incredible work they are doing with reconstructive maxillo-facial surgery on people who only a decade ago would have been permanently disfigured by their traumas and for whom hope and confidence is so important. I talked to the patients and every one of them was bursting with praise for the staff and their energy and devotion, but, conference, that fantastic hospital was built in 1876 to serve the workhouse. We were walking down long, narrow Nightingale wards that were designed by the pioneer of nursing, and, as one of the managers told me, that asking those professionals to work in that environment is like asking a Premiership footballer to play on a ploughed field. And so I was proud to tell them under this government we will totally rebuild that hospital. Johnson says the values he learned from his mother are embodied in the NHS. The NHS is holy to the people of this country because of the simple beauty of its principle that it doesn\u2019t matter who you are or where you come from, but when you are sick the whole country figuratively gathers at your bedside and does everything it can to make you well again and everybody pays to ensure that you have the best doctors and the best nurses and the most effective treatments known to medical science. And after 70 years the results are \u2013 on the whole \u2013amazing. When I was a kid the word cancer was a death knell and heart attack was a terrifying thought. Well, we are slowly defeating the legions of disease. This country has seen the fastest falls in breast cancer in Europe Johnson turns to his family. You are entitled to ask yourselves about my core principles and the ideals that drive me and are going to drive me as your prime minister. I am going to follow the example of my friend Saj. I am going to quote that supreme authority in my family -\u2013 my mother (and by the way for keen students of the divisions in my family you might know that I have kept the ace up my sleeve \u2013 my mother voted leave). He says he learnt important lessons from his mother. My mother taught me to believe strongly in the equal importance, the equal dignity, the equal worth of every human being on the planet and that may sound banal but it is not. Johnson says if the EU does not accept his offer, the alternative will be a no-deal Brexit. And I hope very much that our friends understand that and compromise in their turn. Because if we fail to get an agreement because of what is essentially a technical discussion of the exact nature of future customs checks, when that technology is improving the whole time, then let us be in no doubt that the alternative is no deal. That is not an outcome we want. It is not an outcome we seek at all. But let me tell you this, conference, it is an outcome for which we are ready. Johnson says he is tabling Brexit plans in Brussels. Today in Brussels we are tabling what I believe are constructive and reasonable proposals Which provide a compromise for both sides We will under no circumstances have checks at or near the border in Northern Ireland We will respect the peace process and the Good Friday agreement And by a process of renewable democratic consent by the executive and assembly of Northern ireland we will go further and protect the existing regulatory arrangements for farmers and other businesses on both sides of the border And at the same time we will allow the UK - whole and entire - to withdraw from the EU, with control of our own trade policy from the start. And to protect the union And yes this is a compromise by the UK Johnson claims that the Tories, and the British, are pro-European. It cannot be stressed too much that this is not an anti-European party and it is not an anti-European country. We love Europe. We are European. At least, \u201cI love Europe,\u201d Johnson says. After what seems like a moment\u2019s hesitation, the audience applaud. Johnson is back to the case for getting Brexit done. I am afraid that after three and a half years people are beginning to feel that they are being taken for fools. They are beginning to suspect that there are forces in this country that simply don\u2019t want Brexit delivered at all. And if they turn out to be right in that suspicion then I believe there will be grave consequences for trust in democracy. Let\u2019s get Brexit done on 31 October. Let\u2019s get it done because of the opportunities that Brexit will bring, not just to take back control of our money and our borders and our laws. To regulate differently and better, and to take our place as a proud and independent global campaigner for free trade. Let\u2019s get it done because delay is so pointless and expensive. Let\u2019s get it done because we need to build our positive new partnership with the EU. Johnson uses the pre-briefed passage about how 2020 would be a year of chaos under Labour. (See 11.33am.) Johnson turns to Labour - and he revives his claim that Jeremy Corbyn had a call for general election removed from his Labour conference speech. (Corbyn has denied this.) Last week Jeremy Corbyn had a number of damaging and retrograde ideas in his speech he wants a 4 day week - which would slash the wages of people on low incomes he wants to ban private schools and expropriate their property Even though it would cost the taxpayer seven billion to educate the kids he wants to stamp out excellence in schools by banning Ofsted the inspectors who ensure that schools are safe for our children but he had one good idea - he had a whole paragraph repeating what he has said every week for the last three years he wants an election now \u2013 or that is what he was going to say, poor fellow the only trouble is that the paragraph was censored by Tohn McDonnell or possibly Keir Starmer so we have the astonishing spectacle of the leader of the opposition being prevented by his colleagues from engaging in his constitutional function which is to try to remove me from office and in this age of creative litigation I am surprised that no one has yet sued him for breach of contract Johnson restates his determination to get Brexit done. What people want, what leavers want,what remainers want, what the whole world wants \u2013 is to be calmly and sensibly done with the subject, and to move on. And that is why we are coming out of the EU on 31 October, come what may. Conference, let\u2019s get Brexit done. Johnson says voters have more say over I\u2019m a Celebrity than they do over Brexit. And the sad truth is that voters have more say over I\u2019m a Celebrity than they do over this House of Commons. Which refuses to deliver Brexit, refuses to do anything constructive and refuses to have an election just at the moment when voters are desperate for us to focus on their priorities we are continuing to chew the supermasticated subject of Brexit. Johnson is now talking about parliament - and reviving one of his favourite metaphors. There is one part of the British system that seems to be on the blink. If parliament were a laptop, then the screen would be showing the pizza wheel of doom. If parliament were a school, Ofsted would be shutting it down. If parliament were a reality TV show, the whole lot of us would have been voted out of the jungle by now. But at least we could have watched the speaker being forced to eat a kangaroo testicle. I will be posting quotes from the text distributed by CCHQ as Boris Johnson speaks. But, despite being an accomplished writer, he does not seem to believe in punctuation when writing speeches. Normally I would tidy it up, but there won\u2019t be time. Johnson says he has been PM for only 70 days. But he has seen so many things that have given him hope. I have seen so many things that give cause for hope. Hospitals that are finally getting the investment to match the devotion of the staff, schools where standards of reading are rising through the use of synthetic phonics, police colleges where idealistic young men and women are enrolling in large numbers to fight crime across the country, shipyards in Scotland that are building superb modern type 26 frigates for sale around the world \u2013 and every one of those high-wage, high-skill jobs in shipbuilding is a testament to the benefits of belonging to the United Kingdom. Boris Johnson starts. He says he thinks some members may have been \u201cpeppered with abuse\u201d as they arrived. If they were, they should not worry. Conservatives are not abashed by that, he says. He starts with a tribute to his predecessor, Theresa May. The party will continue with her work tackling domestic violence and modern slavery. Boris Johnson is arriving in the hall, shaking hands as he heads towards the stage, including shaking hands with members of his cabinet. The lights are down, and a video is now being played. It has featured a baby and a puppy, among other things. There is a recording of Boris Johnson talking about taking first steps, in relation to Brexit. He says the Tories will restore trust in democracy, and get Brexit done. Here is an extract from Boris Johnson\u2019s speech released overnight. Voters are desperate for us to focus on their other priorities -\u2013 what people want, what leavers want, what remainers want, what the whole world wants \u2013 is to move on. That is why we are coming out of the EU on 31 October. Let\u2019s get Brexit done -\u2013 we can, we must and we will. Corbyn wants to turn the whole of 2020 \u2013 which should be a great year for this country \u2013 into the chaos and cacophony of two more referendums \u2013 a second referendum on Scottish independence, even though the people of Scotland were promised that the 2014 vote would be a once in a generation vote, and a second referendum on the EU, even though we were promised that the 2016 vote would be a once in a generation vote. Can you imagine another three years of this? That is the Corbyn agenda \u2013 stay in the EU beyond 31 October, paying a billion pounds a month for the privilege, followed by years of uncertainty for business and everyone else. My friends, I am afraid that after three and a half years people are beginning to feel that they are being taken for fools. They are beginning to suspect that there are forces in this country that simply don\u2019t want Brexit delivered at all. And if they turn out to be right in that suspicion then I believe there will be grave consequences for trust in democracy. Let\u2019s get Brexit done on 31 October so in 2020 our country can move on. Boris Johnson will be addressing the Tory conference shortly. Cabinet ministers have been coming into the hall to take their seats. In an interview with Emma Barnett on Radio 5 Live Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, said that if the UK did not agree a Brexit deal with the EU, it would leave on 31 October anyway. Asked how that would be possible given that the Benn Act requires the PM to request an extension in these circumstance, Truss admitted that she did now know. She said: I don\u2019t know the precise details of exactly what we will do, and even if I did I wouldn\u2019t tell you. Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, has signalled that she is content with the Brexit plans drawn up by Boris Johnson. Speaking to the BBC, she declined to say if she had seen the proposals in detail. But she continued: What we are doing with his prime minister is working very closely with him and we will continue to work closely with him over the next couple of hours and days, and I hope we do get a deal that is acceptable to the European Union and one that is good for the whole of the United Kingdom. What people need to remember is after the withdrawal agreement and the backstop came out, what was happening was Northern Ireland was going to be in a different customs union, we were going to be in separate regulations without any democratic say. I think it is important that we now try and get a deal that is good for Northern Ireland as well as the rest of the UK. The backstop has always been identified as the huge stumbling block. Let\u2019s fix it and let\u2019s get a deal. At the Conservative party conference, Alister Jack, the Scottish secretary, has described suggestions that a no-deal Brexit would lead to severe delays at cross-channel ports as \u201cabsolute nonsense\u201d. Responding to a question during a Q&amp;A session a few minutes ago, he said: I don\u2019t subscribe to this theory that very much different is going to happen. I think the ports will all continue to flow much as they do now, to be honest. The idea that suddenly we\u2019re not going to get medicines in, or all these other ridiculous scaremongering stories \u2013 I can\u2019t see why. Hauliers have to finance their trucks and pay for them. That means the wheels have to keep turning. Ferry companies have to finance their ferries. The ferries keep flowing. The ports employ people. They need the income from traffic going through the ports. This idea everything is going to seize up, and there\u2019s going to be a disaster, especially in the event of a no-deal Brexit, I think is absolute nonsense. Business will find a way through. Tory members applauded him warmly. Jack\u2019s comment did not take account of the fact that his own government has spent billions preparing for a no-deal Brexit, with the Department for Transport making plans to spend up to \u00a3300m on freight capacity to compensate for possible gridlock at cross-Channel ports. It also did not square with what the chief executive of the port of Dover told a conference fringe meeting yesterday about how, based on the government\u2019s own assessment of how a no-deal Brexit would disrupt traffic at the port, Dover would lose trade worth \u00a31bn a week for some months. Jack is MP for Dumfries and Galloway, which includes the port of Cairnryan. He said he hoped it would have more trade with Ireland going through it after Brexit. In his speech to the Tory conference, Julian Smith, the Northern Ireland secretary, announced some growth deal funding for Northern Ireland. He said: This morning I announced that the people and businesses of Mid-South West Northern Ireland and Causeway Coast and Glens will benefit from \u00a3163m of UK government funding, supporting economic growth, job creation and investment in local projects. This means that every part of Northern Ireland now benefits from growth deal funding. His speech hardly mentioned Brexit. These are from RTE\u2019s Europe editor, Tony Connelly. Section 10 of the European Union Withdrawal Act 2018 \u2013 which prohibits any \u201cborder arrangements\u201d between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland \u2013 will cause a problem for the government\u2019s latest Brexit plan, the businesswoman and legal campaigner Gina Miller has warned. Speaking at a breakfast meeting at the London law firm Bird &amp; Bird, Miller said there could be many more \u201clegal twists and turns\u201d before the Brexit crisis is resolved. Quoting from section 10 of the act, Miller \u2013 who has won two landmark cases at the supreme court against the government \u2013 said it could prove a problem for the government. Section 10 outlaws anything that would \u201cdiminish any form of north-south cooperation provided for by the Belfast agreement (as defined by section 98 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998)\u201d. It also bans any move to \u201ccreate or facilitate border arrangements between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after exit day which feature physical infrastructure, including border posts, or checks and controls, that did not exist before exit day and are not in accordance with an agreement between the United Kingdom and the EU.\u201d It has been raised in Northern Ireland Brexit court cases. Miller also revealed she is frequently approached by EU citizens who thank her for her legal cases but tell her: \u2018Goodbye. I\u2019m leaving. We have been here for 20 years but because we don\u2019t have the right papers for filling out a complicated process, [we\u2019re off].\u2019 Miller added: I\u2019m absolutely disgusted that this is something that parliament, which I had fought so hard to come back, has not been talking about. We must stop these divisions. Boris Johnson\u2019s final \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d Brexit offer to Brussels is in danger of being dead on arrival after it was rounded on by government and opposition parties in Ireland, my colleagues Lisa O\u2019Carroll and Daniel Boffey report. Philippe Lamberts, co-leader of the Greens-European Free Alliance in the European parliament and a member of the parliament\u2019s Brexit steering group, told Sky News that the EU had yet to see what the UK was offering, but that he was worried by the government\u2019s claim it was a \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d offer. He said he saw \u201cmajor problems\u201d in the plans as leaked to the Telegraph. He said: The British government cannot seriously expect us to basically destroy the single market. That is what would happen if for instance, as Stephen Barclay [the Brexit secretary] suggested, we should keep a 500km border open into the single market. He also said he did not think Boris Johnson was committed to getting a deal anyway. He explained: My sense, but it is only my guess, is that what he is seeking is a no-deal Brexit, but with the ability of putting the blame on the EU27. That is consistent with the way he has behaved, with his public statements, the way he has antagonised both the EU27 and his own parliament. He doesn\u2019t seem like a person who genuinely seeks a deal. This is what Brandon Lewis, the Home Office minister, told Newsnight last night about this being the UK\u2019s \u201cfinal offer\u201d. Lewis said: The offer the prime minister will make is the offer he is going to make to the European Union. We will publish it tomorrow. That is our final offer. From Jon Stone, the Independent\u2019s Europe correspondent. These are from Nicolai von Ondarza, an EU specialist at SWP, a German foreign affairs thinktank. Last night, Mujtaba Rahman, a former European commission official who provides well-regarded Brexit analysis for the Eurasia consultancy, sent out a briefing revising down his assessment of the chances of the UK and the EU agreeing a deal to 10%. Previously he had put the chances at 25%. He thinks there is now an 80% chance of an election, and a 10% chance of no deal. Here is an extract from his briefing. London admits that Boris has scrapped Theresa May\u2019s pledge that there could be no border \u201cinfrastructure\u201d or \u201crelated checks and controls\u201d. But government sources are adamant that its final proposals will mean \u201cno new infrastructure anywhere\u201d. However, they admit the UK is still pursuing minimal, non-intrusive \u201cbehind-the-border checks\u201d using \u201cexisting processes and greater market-surveillance cooperation.\u201d They hope the UK blueprint will be good enough to persuade EU to enter the negotiating \u201ctunnel\u201d in the run-up to the European council, without further leaks that could scupper a deal. Remarkably, one senior minister said: \u201cIt will be better than they [the EU] expect \u2026 The hope is that both sides then move in concert and we get over the line.\u201d Johnson wants to keep the Democratic Unionist party onboard and some ministers believe that could yet lead to the re-emergence of an old idea \u2013 time-limit to the backstop\u2013 to pave a way for a deal. Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, has signalled possible support for the move. However, the Irish remain opposed to a time-limit, while the Irish and Brussels\u2019 reception to the government\u2019s plans so far has been very hostile \u2026 In Brussels, there remain grave doubts about whether Boris is serious about a deal. Indeed, the row over the leaked plan could be seen as the start of the \u201cblame game\u201d that would follow a failure to reach agreement. In Johnson\u2019s planned \u201cpeople versus parliament\u201d election, Brussels is cast in a \u201cbad guy\u201d role alongside MPs. This is what Patrick O\u2019Donovan, an Irish government minister, told BBC Newsnight last night about the UK government\u2019s plans for an alternative to the backstop, as reported by the Telegraph. He said: The Good Friday agreement deserves a proper insurance policy, not over a period of time but indefinitely. Ireland\u2019s position on the common market and the customs union has to be maintained, and there can be no return to any hard border. The people of Ireland, and the island of Ireland deserve a lot better than that. In an interview on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, James Cleverly, the Conservative party chairman, said it was time for the EU to show flexibility in the Brexit talks. He said: The way negotiations work is both parties need to be flexible and the UK, over the last 18 months or so including the proposals that the former prime minister brought forward, has been pragmatic and it has been flexible and will in the future. The UK has been flexible, but a negotiation means both parties need to be flexible. What we need to see now is the EU being flexible. If they can be pragmatic and flexible, we can get a deal done and leave with a deal on 31 October but we are going to leave on 31 October whatever [happens]. These are from Mark Devenport, the BBC\u2019s Northern Ireland political editor. Simon Coveney, the Irish foreign minister and deputy prime minister, has said this morning he does not think there will be a Brexit deal if the UK insists on customs checks taking place somewhere on the island of Ireland. As Sky News reports, speaking to journalists this morning, Coveney said he had not yet seen the UK plan, and wanted to wait until he had read it before delivering a verdict. But he continued: Certainly, from what we\u2019re reading this morning, I would not be too encouraged by it. Essentially if [Boris Johnson] is proposing customs checks on the island of Ireland, then I don\u2019t think that is going to be the basis of an agreement. But let\u2019s wait and see the detail of that before we make a full judgment on it. Boris Johnson will wrap up the Conservative party conference in Manchester later this morning with the traditional leader\u2019s keynote speech. This week he has sounded desperate to talk about almost anything other than Brexit, and the Tories have been meticulously preparing a domestic policy agenda intended to neutralise Labour attack lines ahead of a general election. (They have even been banging on about bus services, which must be a first for any Conservative party conference \u2013 a belated recognition that Jeremy Corbyn has correctly identified this as an issue that is very important to voters outside London.) But the speech coincides with the latest Brexit talks with the EU coming to a head, with the government expected this afternoon to publish its plan for an alternative to the backstop. As we report in our overnight story, the plan seems to involve Northern Ireland staying under EU single market regulations for agri-food and manufactured goods until at least 2025, but not in the customs union. Here is our story. The Telegraph\u2019s Europe editor, Peter Foster, broke the story with details of what is on offer last night. No 10 has disputed some details of his report, but not the broad thrust of it. He has a Twitter thread, starting here, explaining what is on offer. How will the EU respond? We have not had a definitive answer yet, but the early briefing suggests the reaction will be chilly. These are from the BBC\u2019s Europe editor, Katya Adler. Here is the agenda for the day. 10am: The conference opens with a session on strengthening the union, with contributions from Julian Smith, the Northern Ireland secretary, Alister Jack, the Scottish secretary, and Alun Cairns, the Welsh secretary. 10.45am: A session on women in politics. 11.35am: Boris Johnson\u2019s speech to the conference. 12pm: Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, faces Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, at PMQs. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will be focusing mostly on Brexit and Boris Johnson\u2019s speech. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

In the latter two cases, inflation still remains extremely low.</p> <p>The investment bank heavyweight Goldman Sachs said on Wednesday that the RBA could resort to a $200bn bond-buying scheme if, as many economists expect, its rate cuts don\u2019t lift inflation.</p> <p>Andrew Boak, Goldman Sachs\u2019 chief economist in Australia and New Zealand, said in a research note that negative interest rates would be needed to boost inflation to the target level and therefore estimated \u201can equivalent degree of stimulus could be approximated by a $200bn QE program\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cWe continue to see a material risk that the RBA will deliver even deeper rate cuts and be drawn into unconventional policies.</p> <p>\u201cFor now, however, this remains outside our central scenario given governor Lowe\u2019s concerns about financial stability risks from loose monetary policy.\u201d</p> <p>Most economic forecasters believe another rate cut is only a matter of time after RBA governor Philip Lowe emphasised more headwinds on jobs and wages growth in his statement after Tuesday\u2019s meeting.</p> <p>UBS economists, who were among the first to predict that the bank would cut the cash rate this year, now forecast the bank will go to 0.5% in November after Lowe\u2019s surprisingly comments.</p> <p>Westpac economists also believe that with the cash rate almost certainly headed to 0.5%, \u201cwe need some unconventional monetary policy boost\u201d such as bond buying to meet the bank\u2019s target.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you get to 0.5% you have to bring in other measures,\u201d said Damien McColough, Westpac\u2019s head of rates strategy.</p> <p>Another factor pushing rates lower \u2013 and raising the prospect of QE \u2013 was the likelihood that other central banks would continue to cut their own borrowing costs. The US Federal Reserve is expected to reduce borrowing costs again this month, which puts pressure on others to follow suit. The European Central Bank, meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/12/ecb-announces-fresh-stimulus-as-eurozone-economy-falters\">has pledged to restart its massive bond-buying program</a> and the Bank of England said it would likely cut rates even if <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/27/bank-of-england-hints-at-interest-rate-cut-even-without-no-deal-brexit\">Brexit does not go ahead</a>.</p> <p>Such moves would force smaller central banks like the RBA to keep rates low or risk a higher currency.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Reserve Bank of Australia could be forced into unconventional policy measures such as money printing to save the economy from stagnation if its latest round of interest rates cuts fail to stimulate growth, economists have warned. After cutting the cash rate for the third time this year on Tuesday to a fresh record low of 0.75%, the central bank warned that there could be more cuts to come as it pursues its twin targets of reducing unemployment and keeping inflation between 2% and 3%. But it has failed to meet the inflation aim for 20 successive quarters, leading to increasing speculation that it will be forced to use less conventional methods such as buying up billions of dollars of government bonds to flood the financial system with money. This controversial process, known as quantitative easing (QE), was used after the global financial crisis by central banks in the US, UK, eurozone and Japan. In the latter two cases, inflation still remains extremely low. The investment bank heavyweight Goldman Sachs said on Wednesday that the RBA could resort to a $200bn bond-buying scheme if, as many economists expect, its rate cuts don\u2019t lift inflation. Andrew Boak, Goldman Sachs\u2019 chief economist in Australia and New Zealand, said in a research note that negative interest rates would be needed to boost inflation to the target level and therefore estimated \u201can equivalent degree of stimulus could be approximated by a $200bn QE program\u201d. He added: \u201cWe continue to see a material risk that the RBA will deliver even deeper rate cuts and be drawn into unconventional policies. \u201cFor now, however, this remains outside our central scenario given governor Lowe\u2019s concerns about financial stability risks from loose monetary policy.\u201d Most economic forecasters believe another rate cut is only a matter of time after RBA governor Philip Lowe emphasised more headwinds on jobs and wages growth in his statement after Tuesday\u2019s meeting. UBS economists, who were among the first to predict that the bank would cut the cash rate this year, now forecast the bank will go to 0.5% in November after Lowe\u2019s surprisingly comments. Westpac economists also believe that with the cash rate almost certainly headed to 0.5%, \u201cwe need some unconventional monetary policy boost\u201d such as bond buying to meet the bank\u2019s target. \u201cWhen you get to 0.5% you have to bring in other measures,\u201d said Damien McColough, Westpac\u2019s head of rates strategy. Another factor pushing rates lower \u2013 and raising the prospect of QE \u2013 was the likelihood that other central banks would continue to cut their own borrowing costs. The US Federal Reserve is expected to reduce borrowing costs again this month, which puts pressure on others to follow suit. The European Central Bank, meanwhile, has pledged to restart its massive bond-buying program and the Bank of England said it would likely cut rates even if Brexit does not go ahead. Such moves would force smaller central banks like the RBA to keep rates low or risk a higher currency.",

For Barcelona, the way Frenkie de Jong, Gerard Piqu\u00e9 and Sergio Busquets had been drawn to the ball and left stranded was a portrait of a recurring problem, the wild slide-tackles that followed deepening the sense that they were grasping for some control. They were, after all, trailing for the fifth time in nine games, aware that turning this around would be some task. First, they had to survive. \u201cWe\u2019re not going with helmets on just to defend,\u201d Conte had said and his team was as good as his word. Inter had less of the ball but used it with a precision, purpose and clarity Barcelona lacked. Asked what he thought of them, Ernesto Valverde said simply: \u201cBloody hell, a great team.\u201d As if to underline that, Inter played from deep, their goalkeeper Samir Handanovic joining the passing triangle. One five-pass, one-touch move inside their own area saw them reach an open field; six more passes and 70 metres later, Stefano Sensi was on the edge of the box shooting just over. Somehow, it was still only 1-0 and Barcelona would be grateful. Milan Skriniar had already had one ruled out, N\u00e9lson Semedo had dived to block Nicol\u00f2 Barella and Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen had superbly saved Mart\u00ednez\u2019s header. Next, Alexis S\u00e1nchez headed Sensi\u2019s clipped delivery wide and, as Barcelona were again pulled out of position, Semedo had to dash back to stop Lautaro. Barcelona were alive but needed something to happen and Su\u00e1rez happened, thumping a volley from Arturo Vidal\u2019s pass on 58 minutes. Vidal had replaced Busquets, with De Jong moving central and the game shifted. Next, the Chilean and Messi worked it to Griezmann who smashed into the sidenetting before his replacement, Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, struck over. And that, it seemed, was that. But at the end of his first full game of the season Messi set off on a long run, left three men behind and slipped it to Su\u00e1rez who, dipping his shoulder and stepping into the area away from Diego God\u00edn, finished calmly.",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has been accused of \u201cincitement to violence\u201d and threatened with obstruction charges in the fast-escalating battle over impeachment, as the president maintained his aggressive counter-attack against Democratic leaders and the whistleblower who precipitated the inquiry. \u201cWe\u2019re not fooling around here,\u201d Adam Schiff, the chair of the powerful House intelligence committee, said in Washington on Wednesday. Elijah Cummings, the chair of the House oversight committee, revealed that it would issue a subpoena if the White House failed to hand over documents on contacts with Ukraine by Friday. \u201cI do not take this step lightly,\u201d Cummings said, saying the White House had stonewalled on demands for cooperation for several weeks. The Democrats\u2019 investigative steps have infuriated Trump, who was live-tweeting their press conference on Capitol Hill. He denounced the impeachment process, in block capitals, as \u201cBULLSHIT\u201d and later repeated an extreme claim that Schiff should be investigated for treason. The speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, announced the start of the impeachment inquiry eight days ago, focusing on a whistleblower complaint that emerged the week before about a July phone call between Donald Trump and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The complaint and a memo of the call issued by the White House have since been released, indicating that Trump asked Zelenskiy to investigate Joe Biden, a leading rival for the White House in the 2020 election, while the US was withholding vital aid from Ukraine. Schiff insisted on Wednesday that the inquiry would not be slowed down by presidential \u201cstonewalling\u201d or threatening language against potential witnesses. \u201cWe\u2019re very busy,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cWe are proceeding deliberately but at the same time we feel a real sense of urgency here.\u201d Democratic-run House committees heard from the state department\u2019s inspector general, an independent watchdog, on Wednesday, followed by the former special envoy on Ukraine on Thursday and the former ambassador to Kyiv next week. But they are battling with the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, about other depositions by state department officials and the handover of relevant documents. Schiff and Pelosi condemned Trump for rhetoric directed at an intelligence agency whistleblower who revealed details of the phone call at the core of the impeachment proceedings. Trump has referred to the whistleblower and the officials who provided information included in the complaint as \u201cspies\u201d and implied they should face the death penalty. Senior officials and some leading Republicans have confirmed the whistleblower used recommended legal channels but Trump repeated the \u201cspy\u201d allegation on Wednesday. Schiff said the president was engaging in \u201ca blatant effort to intimidate witnesses\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s an incitement of violence,\u201d he said. \u201cThe president probably doesn\u2019t realize how dangerous his statement is,\u201d Pelosi added. Trump, who was clearly watching the press conference live, unleashed an expletive-laced Twitter tirade. \u201cThe Do Nothing Democrats should be focused on building up our Country, not wasting everyone\u2019s time and energy on BULLSHIT, which is what they have been doing ever since I got overwhelmingly elected in 2016,\u201d he said. The president continued to tweet every few minutes, lashing out at Schiff, who he called a \u201clowlife\u201d, until it was time to greet the visiting Finnish president, Sauli Niinist\u00f6. The fury of Trump\u2019s commentary reflected how impeachment has come to consume his focus and attention. At a press conference at the end of his meeting with Niinist\u00f6, Trump, who repeated one of his favourite self-descriptions as \u201ca very stable genius\u201d, repeatedly refused to answer a question about what he had been asking Zelenskiy to do in relation to the Bidens, and lost his temper at the Reuters journalist asking it. \u201cAre you talking to me?\u201d Trump shouted. \u201cDid you hear me?\u201d he demanded, telling the journalist to ask the Finnish president a question instead. In his own struggle with Congress, Pompeo was forced to admit on Wednesday he took part in the July phone call between Trump and Zelenskiy. Pompeo made the admission while on a trip to Rome, after his participation in the call had been reported in the US press. When asked in a television interview 10 days ago about the Trump conversation with Zelenskiy, Pompeo had looked quizzical and implied he was hearing about it for the first time. On Wednesday, Pompeo said: \u201cAs for was I on the phone call? I was on the phone call.\u201d But he presented the conversation as part of normal state department business, trying to bolster a new Ukrainian government against the threat of Russia. He referred dismissively to the growing scandal engulfing the Trump administration as \u201call this noise\u201d. It has become clear Pompeo has only limited power to stop committees from gathering evidence for an impeachment inquiry. One of the five witnesses deposed, Kurt Volker, former special envoy for Ukraine who resigned last week, confirmed he would speak to the committees in closed session on Thursday. The Daily Beast reported on Wednesday that Volker resigned as Pompeo was attempting to push him out of his post, in the hope of reducing the pressure on the state department. Schiff said Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Kyiv, would appear next week. Press reports said she was due to give a deposition on 11 October. The state department\u2019s inspector general, Steve Linick, went to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to brief Congress on documents related to relations with Ukraine. After the briefing, the Maryland Democratic congressman Jamie Raskin described the material as a collection of unfounded allegations involving the Bidens and Yovanovitch. \u201cIt\u2019s essentially a packet of propaganda and disinformation spreading conspiracy theories,\u201d Raskin said. The president\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who has played a central role in the Ukraine scandal, later told CNN that he had sent at least some of the material to Pompeo\u2019s office earlier this year and that it included information he had been given by previous Ukrainian prosecutors.",

      "bodyText": "Feast your eyes on Jacob Steinberg\u2019s match report: The Chelsea goalscorers talk. \u201cWe deserved to win tonight, we needed to win,\u201d says Willian, the match-winner. \u201cWe have been working hard every day, every game and the lads did an amazing job. Now we have to carry on.\u201d As for the birthday boy, Tammy Abraham, 22 today, says: \u201cWe came into the game and we knew we needed to win. I knew I\u2019d get my chance today and I think I took it well. A fantastic team performance. We needed three points.\u201d Liverpool got over the line at Anfield: Chelsea supporters serenade Frank Lampard at the final whistle. They\u2019re over the moon with that. That was an encouraging performance, though Kepa nor Tomori will not want to see a replay of that late Soumar\u00e9 chance in a hurry. Elsewhere in Group H, Ajax have wiped the floor with Valencia, winning 3-0 in Spain. That result means Chelsea are third on goal difference after two games. It was not without a couple of late scares but Chelsea get the job done. Willian, on his 300th appearance, is ultimately the match-winner after Tammy Abraham scored his first Champions League goal to open the scoring in northern France. 90+2 min: What is going on? Kepa makes a total hash of a clearance after Tomori overcooks a simple pass back to his goalkeeper. Kepa gets it all wrong, slicing the ball up into the air and laying it on a plate for Boubakary Soumar\u00e9, who rushes on to the loose ball. Soumar\u00e9 must think he is going to tuck the ball away but Kepa smothers. Heart-in-mouth stuff for Frank Lampard. Chelsea \u2013 just about \u2013 get off the hook. 90+1 min: Renato Sanches steals possession from Pedro before passing the baton over to Yacizi, who drives Lille forward. Marcos Alonso does brilliantly, tracking back to clear deep inside the Chelsea 18-yard box. Lille attempt to regurgitate things but Xeka\u2019s shot is tame at the end of another probing move. 90 min: There will be a minimum of four added minutes. 89 min: Pedro buys a foul of Xeka on halfway. Cleverly done. 87 min: Mateo Kovacic replaces Mason Mount, who has been a bit of a passenger the last 20 minutes or so. Willian seemingly went off with cramp. Chelsea are going to have to dig deep late on. 85 min: Pedro replaces Willian. 83 min: Right on cue, Tomori gets away with one. Big time. Alonso plays a routine pass back to the defender, who dozes off as the ball zooms beyond him and Victor Osimhen is in. The Nigeria striker skates forward, bearing down on goal but Kepa nicks the ball away. Whether the goalkeeper made any contact with the striker it is unclear \u2013 but Osimhen is adamant he should have had a penalty. 82 min: Fikayo Tomori does superbly to shepherd Jonathan Bamba out of play, relieving a spell of pressure as Chelsea win a goal-kick. Chelsea have had their moments at the back but Tomori has been a class act. Lampard had him with him at Derby last year. 80 min: That\u2019s a huge goal for Chelsea. As for Abraham\u2019s opener, here are a couple of meaningless stats to boot, courtesy of Opta: Abraham\u2019s goal (assisted by Tomori) was Chelsea\u2019s first in the Champions League scored and assisted by two English players since March 2012, when Frank Lampard set up John Terry against Napoli. Fan of that one? Here\u2019s another. Abraham is the second Englishman to score on his birthday in the Champions League, after Raheem Sterling (for Manchester City v Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach in December 2015). The Brazilian strikes on his 300th Chelsea appearance. Callum Hudson-Odoi is the catalyst, way out on the left flank. The teenager gets the better of his marker and floats a cross in towards the back post, where Willian is hovering. As the ball drops, Willian volleys it across goal, into the corner beyond Maignan. A sweet hit, and a priceless goal as far as Chelsea are concerned. A trademark punch of the air by Lampard follows. He\u2019s made up with that. 75 min: Lille make another change. Luiz Ara\u00fajo is replaced by Xeka, whose real name is, wait for it ... Miguel \u00c2ngelo da Silva Rocha. 71 min: End-to-end, now. Araujo puts a fire out in defence as Abraham fires across goal and Lille promptly shoot up the other end through Victor Osimhen, who flashes an effort just wide! The angle was always against him. 69 min: Azpilicueta\u2019s cross eludes everyone in the box! It was a beautiful ball in but Abraham could not get anything on it. This game could still go either way. At Anfield, a seventh goal: 68 min: Renato Sanches is still only 22. Who knew? The Portuguese midfielder, not so long ago of Swansea, replaces Benjamin Andr\u00e9. 67 min: Callum Hudson-Odoi, the 18-year-old, replaces wing-back Reece James for his Champions League debut. Can Hudson-Odoi provide the impetus Chelsea require? James impressed going forward and held his own defensively. 64 min: Right on cue Willian speeds down the right flank and drills a low ball across goal. Jos\u00e9 Fonte does well to get across and sweep clear, reading the danger, with Mason Mount lurking in the box. Chelsea flight the ball back in towards the back post, where Alonso stabs at goal on the half-volley but it\u2019s not a clean strike. Chelsea will have to start over. Lille have proved stubborn. 63 min: It is all a bit pedestrian from Chelsea, whose only real tactic has been to ping the ball out wide to one of Alonso or James. 61 min: Ikone\u2019s night is over. Yusuf Yazici, a Turkish international, is on in his place. Ikone is presumably withdrawn as a result of that monstrous challenge by Zouma. 59 min: Meanwhile, Salzburg have pulled level at Anfield: 57 min: Lille are knocking on the door, probing through Ikone and Bamba. Just as Ikone thinks he has found a way through the Chelsea back line, he is challenged by Kurt Zouma, who makes an excellent sliding tackle on the forward. 54 min: That chance has revved up the locals. Chelsea have been on the ropes at the back at times but have otherwise looked comfortable without offering an awful lot going forward. The onus has been on Reece James or Marcos Alonso to cause problems, which they have done on occasions. But Chelsea have struggled to get much service in to Abraham or Willian and co. 52 min: Lille go close! Benjamin Andr\u00e9 ghosts in to the front post and Kepa does magnificently to get fingertips to his glanced header. Chelsea survive. It all stemmed from a contentious corner \u2013 as far as Lille were concerned anyway. Gabriel tumbled in the box with Tomori in close proximity but it seemed nothing more than that, and the match officials agreed. But from the resulting corner, Lille almost take the lead, with Andr\u00e9 flicking a header at goal. 49 min: ... Tomori gets up but heads over. 48 min: Mandava does well to swing a leg at a teasing Reece James cross \u2013 but Chelsea waste the resulting corner. It was a wonderful ball in from the right, whipped in at speed towards the front post. Chelsea have had plenty of joy in wide areas. But back come Chelsea, who win another corner. Willian will float it in again ... 47 min: No changes at the interval, other than the Belarusian referee Aleksei Kulbakov remembering to pick up a canister of vanishing spray. 46 min: Victor Osimhen gets the second half started. Before we get back under way, some news: Elsewhere, Liverpool lead 3-1: Level-pegging at the interval. 45+2 min: Jorginho rattles a post! A sweeping first-time effort clips the outside of Mike Maignan\u2019s left post. A wonderful effort by the midfielder, who was lurking on the edge of the box after Chelsea surged down the left flank through Alonso. Almost! Alonso\u2019s initial ball caused havoc, with Abraham sticking a leg out to try and latch on to it but Chelsea recycled possession, laying the ball on for Jorginho to smack an effort towards goal. Inches away. 45 min: There will be two added minutes. 44 min: N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 loses possession on the edge of the Lille box and, as Boubakary Soumar\u00e9 breaks with the ball, Willian makes a clumsy challenge. But the hosts fail to do anything with it and Ikone is booked for hauling down a roaming Fikayo Tomori. Alonso heads harmlessly over from the resulting Mount free-kick. 42 min: ... Alonso takes aim \u2013 but his free-kick is wayward. 40 min: Ikone slips in Bamba, it looks as though the Lille forward is in ... but Reece James gets across to intercept. On a booking, he had to be careful but the wing-back used his strength to get the upper hand. Chelsea flood forward up the other end and Mason Mount draws a foul from Jos\u00e9 Fonte. Free-kick, 20-odd yards out ... 37 min: Victor Osimhen is almost in again, slipped through one-on-one 30 yards out \u2013 but Kepa races off his line to clear. The 20-year-old had eluded Kurt Zouma in the Chelsea defence. Soon after Osimhen is embroilde in a contretemps with Azpilicueta but the referee is quick to cool things down. 36 min: Lille\u2019s tails are suddenly up on the back of that equaliser. Jonathan Bamba does brilliantly to bamboozle Abraham on the byline after Alonso was pressured into a mistake by Jos\u00e9 Fonte. Chelsea have gone from cruising to struggling to clear their lines. 35 min: Reece James is booked on his Champions League debut for for a crude foul on the Lille forward Ikone. In terms of the hosts\u2019 leveller, Lampard warned Chelsea they could not switch off but a moment\u2019s lax defending and Lille are level. Chelsea are punished. Lille spray an inswinging corner into the box and Victor Osimhen gets up unmarked to nod in. That\u2019s the Nigeria striker\u2019s seventh goal of the season. But so, so sloppy from a Chelsea perspective. Their zonal marking was absent. 31 min: Cracking save by Kepa! Chelsea get ovverun in midfield and Luiz Ara\u00fajo steps inside to bend a left-footed shot at goal but the Chelsea goalkeeper is equal to it. Lille came scampering upfield, seizing on Willian surrendering possession and, before Chelsea had chance to gather themselves, Ara\u00fajo almost had the ball in the net. And now Lille, piling on the pressure, win a corner ... 29 min: Kepa does a keepie-uppie and thuds the ball clear as Chelsea get a bit hot under the collar in defence, before Abraham lures Gabriel into making a foul. Meanwhile, some more advice from our very unoffical travel bureau. \u201cNot sure where Msr O\u2019Leary went in Lille but I think he must have missed the incredible Vieux Lille area and the Flemish-style squares and fantastic restaurants,\u201d emails Paul Jaines. \u201cHe should have ventured outside of his Formula 1 hotel next to the motorway ... if he wanted grim he should have gone up the road to Roubaix.\u201d 27 min: Lampard will be pretty chuffed with this, though Chelsea have made some odd decisions in possession. Zouma has just plonked a pass out of defence straight to a red Lille shirt. Still, Chelsea very much in the driving seat. 25 min: Mount almost doubles Chelsea\u2019s lead. The midfielder possibly should have done better. Things are looking good. A 22nd-minute goal on his 22nd birthday for Tammy Abraham. Fikayo Tomori threaded a pass through to the penalty spot, where Mount and Abraham were lurking and the striker takes a touch before prodding home from close range. He finds the corner perfectly. The VAR checks for offside but he\u2019s a yard on. The striker\u2019s good form rolls on, that his eighth goal of the season \u2013 but his first in the Champions League. Lille went to sleep defensively. 20 min: Chelsea get off the hook! Kant\u00e9\u2019s pass is loose and Kurt Zouma makes a mess of his clearance, allowing the ball to bounce before it bobbles kindly for the Lille frontman Victor Osimhen. Fortunately for Chelsea, Kepa is alert and snuffs out the danger, racing out of goal to head clear and extinguish a sloppy spell. 19 min: Alonso is beaten to the ball by Celik \u2013 but the Lille defender is pulled up for catching the Spaniard with his trailing leg. Chelsea win a free-kick just inside their own half and earn another chance to get back on the front foot. Lille have offered precious little but Chelsea\u2019s grip on this game has dwindled. 17 min: Mount volleys wide! Celik nods a headed clearance from a dinked Jorginho pass straight into the midfielder\u2019s path but he gets his angles all wrong and it flashes a few yards wide in the end. Mount did superbly to chest the ball to set himself but the execution was not quite so impressive. 13 min: Zouma gets up to power the ball back where it came from. Lille have been very tentative in their buildup play but do look capable on the counter. Chelsea, as Lampard was at pains to emphasise pre-match, cannot afford to switch off as they did against Valencia or they risk being punished. 12 min: Chelsea continue to flood forward. Meanwhile, some travel advice for those of you mulling over a trip to France. \u201cThe parade of talent quickly leaving Lille is no surprise to me,\u201d emails Shane O\u2019Leary. \u201cI had to stop over in Lille a few weeks back, it was grim. Mind you, Montpellier is brilliant.\u201d 9 min: Mike Maignan punches clear \u2013 but he makes a bit of a meal of it. It stemmed from Willian nudging the ball back for Reece James, who whipped in a wonderful, inviting first-time cross. Up goes Tammy Abraham but he cannot get there. Maignan does, even if unconvincingly and the chance is gone. Chelsea have had plenty of early joy with those wing-backs, James and Alonso. 7 min: Chelsea, momentarily, are at sixes and sevens in defence. Lille counterattack at speed and after Reece James scuffs his clearance, Azpilicueta steps in to make a clearance. Nanitamo Ikone has a pop from the resulting corner but it is Tammy Abraham who makes an all-important block. 5 min: Marcos Alonso fizzes a ball across goal \u2013 but Chelsea cannot get anyone on the end of it! Willian tries to keep the move alive at the back post and recycles possession but neither Mount or Abraham can get a toe to it. Lille have barely had a sniff. Only Jos\u00e9 Fonte has had a genuine touch of the ball, and that was a clearance. 3 min: Neat flick by Willian into Mason Mount, who tries and fails to release Tammy Abraham. Chelsea rework the ball down the left flank but Jos\u00e9 Fonte, the Lille captain, gets across to intervene. Back come Chelsea. 2 min: Chelsea hogging plenty of the ball, knocking it about for fun. They shuffle it across the back line and out wide to Alonso. 1 min: Chelsea are very much three at the back, with Tomori, Zouma and Azpilicueta in situ. Reece James is at right wing-back. Tammy Abraham gets us under way. The teams trudge out of the tunnel. We are just the pre-match formalities \u2013 a few handshakes and that infectious, rip-roaring Champions League anthem \u2013 away from the off at Stade Pierre Mauroy. A decent atmosphere is building. Eight minutes until kick-off. Any predictions? Frank Lampard talks. Of Reece James, who spent last season ripping it up at Wigan Athletic, he says: \u201cI\u2019ve known him since his academy days and saw him be fantastic in the Championship last season. He had a good game against Grimsby and I think he has quality, which he can bring to this game. Reece is another young one and it\u2019s a great game for him.\u201d As for the return of N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9, he adds: \u201cHe has had a stop-start season but I\u2019m pleased to have him back in. He brings us great energy.\u201d Oooooh Tammy Tammy! It\u2019s the striker\u2019s 22nd birthday. Abraham is said to be in line for a call-up to the England squad, which Gareth Southgate names on Thursday. England take on Czech Republic and Bulgaria in Euro 2020 qualifiers this month. Nigeria have been trying to convince Abraham, who has scored seven goals in nine appearances, to pledge his international future their way. The Chelsea skipper speaks. \u201cWe have been working hard on the way he [Frank Lampard] wants us to play,\u201d says C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta. \u201cWe want to bring every game the feeling of wearing the Chelsea shirt, to play with pride and give everything. The only way I can see this team going is up.\u201d Did Lampard always seem destined for management? \u201cYes, you could see his intelligence on the pitch, the will to win. As a manager, he is the same, always trying to get better and improve. The hunger to win is still the same, even if he has transferred his motivation.\u201d Should he step off the bench, the 18-year-old Callum Hudson-Odoi will make his Champions League debut, having made the bench two years ago against Barcelona. Christian Pulisic made his as a 17-year-old for Borussia Dortmund but Frank Lampard cannot find room for the young American among the substitutes. He has been an unused sub in four of Chelsea\u2019s past five matches, playing 90 minutes against, er, Grimsby Town, in the other. And now he\u2019s not in the squad. Pulisic, a \u00a358m signing, last week said: \u201cI want to play as many minutes as I can, that is really my goal, I want to be on the field ... it is tough for me right now. It is very frustrating, but I will continue to work my hardest because I want to play.\u201d Perhaps those comments didn\u2019t go down too well with Lamps. Team news news: N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 starts after shaking off a hamstring injury, while Willian makes his 300th appearance in a Chelsea shirt. Reece James starts but there is no space for Christian Pulisic or Ross Barkley in the 18-man squad, with the latter absent presumably as a result of spilling chips over a Liverpool cabbie\u2019s backseat. Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my is on the bench for the hosts: Lille (4-2-3-1): Maignan; \u00c7elik, Gabriel, Jos\u00e9 Fonte, Reinildo; Soumar\u00e9, Andr\u00e9; Araujo, Ikon\u00e9, Bamba; Osimhen Subs: C\u00e9sar, Soumaoro, Xeka, R\u00e9my, Yazici, Sanches, Bradaric Chelsea (3-4-3): Arrizabalaga; Azpilicueta, Zouma, Tomori; James, Kant\u00e9, Jorginho, Alonso; Willian, Abraham, Mount Subs: Caballero, Christensen, Pedro, Kovacic, Giroud, Hudson-Odoi, Batshuayi Referee: Aleksei Kulbakov (Belarus) Lille has proved a fertile breeding ground for a raft of familiar faces and the odd superstar, none more so than Eden Hazard, a player Chelsea supporters still hold close to their hearts. Divock Origi, Sofiane Boufal, Idrissa Gueye and Djibril Sidibe all started their careers in earnest in northern France before skipping across the channel. As did a few Premier League greats: Pascal Cygan, Peter Odemwingie and Mathieu Debuchy. Now they boast Jos\u00e9 Fonte and Renato Sanches, whose last game against Chelsea saw him pass to an advertising hoarding. Hazard is at Real Madrid but is cherished by Chelsea, who could do with a win to get their Champions League tilt off the ground.

The chief executive of the Australian Banking Association, Anna Bligh, said the peak body had lobbied widely on the issue: \u201cOf course I have spoken to government ministers, shadow ministers, other members of parliament and regulators about the application of responsible lending laws, a significant issue of critical importance to our economy being debated across the country, from the boardroom of the Reserve Bank to local backyard barbecues,\u201d she said.</p> <p><strong>Barnaby Joyce says the Coalition risks \u201cpolitical annihilation\u201d in the bush if the drought worsens and it does not start building dams,</strong> as Labor leader Anthony Albanese <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/03/barnaby-joyce-says-coalition-risks-political-annihilation-in-the-bush-over-drought\">lashed the government</a> for failing to produce a national drought strategy. Albanese toured drought-affected Stanthorpe in Queensland on Wednesday, saying parts of the state were clearly suffering \u201cnatural disaster\u201d and criticising the government for failing to build a single dam since being elected in 2013.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Thursday 3 October. Top stories Boris Johnson has laid out a five-point Brexit offer that would take Britain, including Northern Ireland, out of the customs union, and warned the EU27 there is \u201cvery little time\u201d to do a deal. Labour described Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit proposals as \u201cneither credible nor workable\u201d, claiming his real plan was to force through a no-deal Brexit. Business leaders have told Johnson his Brexit plan risks causing severe damage to the Northern Ireland economy and has ramped up the chance of a no-deal departure. In his first speech to the Conservative party conference as UK prime minister, Johnson offered a clutch of unusual analogies. A heavy campaign of lobbying by Australia\u2019s banks preceded treasurer Josh Frydenberg telling financial regulators not to enforce responsible lending laws \u201ctoo stringently\u201d, Guardian Australia can reveal. Regulators have been left with whiplash by a sudden change in the tone of government remarks over the past month, from a generally tough-on-banks stance following the Hayne royal commission to a new emphasis on the \u201cpersonal responsibility\u201d of borrowers. The chief executive of the Australian Banking Association, Anna Bligh, said the peak body had lobbied widely on the issue: \u201cOf course I have spoken to government ministers, shadow ministers, other members of parliament and regulators about the application of responsible lending laws, a significant issue of critical importance to our economy being debated across the country, from the boardroom of the Reserve Bank to local backyard barbecues,\u201d she said. Barnaby Joyce says the Coalition risks \u201cpolitical annihilation\u201d in the bush if the drought worsens and it does not start building dams, as Labor leader Anthony Albanese lashed the government for failing to produce a national drought strategy. Albanese toured drought-affected Stanthorpe in Queensland on Wednesday, saying parts of the state were clearly suffering \u201cnatural disaster\u201d and criticising the government for failing to build a single dam since being elected in 2013. Following controversy over Joyce\u2019s role as special drought envoy, which Labor has criticised as a political appointment that has not delivered value for taxpayers, the former Nationals leader told Guardian Australia he agreed with Labor that the government needed to \u201cget cracking\u201d on dam construction. A man has been shot dead by police in western Sydney after allegedly firing on officers with a shotgun. Police allege a vehicle stopped outside Penrith police station just after 9.30pm on Wednesday and the man approached a police vehicle with a pump-action 12-gauge shotgun and opened fire. \u201cPolice returned fire and the man suffered a fatal injury. He died at the scene,\u201d police said in a statement early on Thursday. World Bernie Sanders has undergone a heart procedure and is cancelling events until further notice, according to his campaign office. Sanders, 78, a Vermont senator and a leading contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, was hospitalised in Nevada on Tuesday night where he had two stents inserted to treat a blocked artery. Thousands of people protested in Hong Kong on Wednesday to denounce the shooting of a teenage student by police, an escalation of force that has intensified the standoff between protesters and authorities. Nearly 100 Sikh police officers and veterans in the US have called on law enforcement associations to create formal policies to allow officers to wear articles of faith. The appeal, in the form of a letter, came in the wake of the murder of a Sikh-American sheriff\u2019s deputy near Houston, Texas. 250 million children worldwide are forecast to be obese by 2030. Childhood obesity is rising exponentially worldwide as the relentless marketing of junk foods reaches around the globe, according to data shared with the Guardian.

AFLW hopefuls are running the gamut of emotions at the Melbourne draft combine. The tension is tangible as these potential players, all hoping to fulfil their football dreams, are put through their paces, writes Kasey Symons.

Now, this match should be a lot of fun. It\u2019s the European champions against Europe\u2019s form team; the irresistible force vs the irresistible force. And while most of Salzburg\u2019s good results have come in the relatively weak Austrian Bundesliga, it\u2019s still eye-catching stuff. This season, in all competitions, they have played 12, won 11, drawn one and scored 55 (F-I-F-T-etc). That includes three huge wins away from home: 7-1, 6-0 and 5-1. Erling Haaland, the teenage son of former Leeds charmer, Alf-Inge, has belted 17 of those \u2013 including a hat-trick in a 6-2 win over Genk in their opening Champions League group game.</p> <p>Haaland looks like the next big Red Bull Salzburg export. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/02/red-bull-salzburg-anfield-liverpool-scouting-system-mane-keita-champions-league\">Liverpool know all about their ability to find future stars</a>, as Sadio Mane and Naby Keita both spent two years at the club in their formative years.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it for tonight\u2019s blog. I\u2019ll leave you with Andy Hunter\u2019s match report from Anfield. Night! \u201cPlease don\u2019t compare this team to the 87-88 side again,\u201d says Niall Mullen. \u201cYou jinxed them into the 97-98 team instead.\u201d I call it the Kvarme karma. Post-match interviews Mo Salah \u201cIt\u2019s can be tough because the human mind is a little bit like, \u2018Okay we\u2019re gonna win, we\u2019re gonna score again and again\u2019. But they made the game tough for us, and I\u2019m happy that we got three points \u2013 that\u2019s the most important thing.\u201d Sadio Mane \u201cWow. They were really good, honestly. I think we deserved to win but it was a very tough game. I know this team \u2013 they never give up, they try to score all the time and they caused us problems.\u201d That was literally a game of three halves. Liverpool eased into a 3-0 lead and looked like they could score at will; Salzburg scored three quick goals either side of half-time to give Anfield an almighty fright; and then Liverpool composed themselves to win the match through Mo Salah. There were superb goals from Mane, Robertson, Hwang and Minamino. And while the defending on both sides left all sorts to be desired, it was pulsating stuff. Peep peep! A weird and wonderful football match ends in victory for Liverpool, just about. 90+2 min \u201cAre you sure this isn\u2019t a classic Liverpool v Newcastle game?\u201d says Guy Read. \u201cSomeone washed the stripes off the Salzburg kit.\u201d 90+1 min There will be three minutes of added time. 90 min Mo Salah is replaced by Salzburg alumnus Naby Keita. 89 min The match is petering out. Salzburg look knackered, mentally as much as anything. It\u2019s been a brilliant game, so much fun to watch. 86 min Fabinho is booked for a cynical foul on Ashimeru. 86 min \u201cHow on earth,\u201d says Tony Hughes, \u201ccan it go to extra-time?\u201d My point exactly. 85 min Salzburg look like their race is run. Haaland has been slightly disappointing, apart from his goal. I can\u2019t wait to see the return game, though, especially if there\u2019s something riding on it. 84 min I wonder what Brendan Rodgers has made of this. 81 min \u201cWhat a contest!\u201d says Paul Griffin. \u201cFittingly rhythmic given that Salzburg is the birthplace of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. It\u2019s such a shame that Rick Astley is actually from Warrington, otherwise this could have been a contest between the birthplaces of the world\u2019s most influential musicians. Of course, Carole Decker out of T\u2019Pau is from Liverpool, but \u2018most influential\u2019 it seems a bit of a stretch for them, despite the achingly beautiful soft rock crescendo and profound lyricism of \u2018China in Your Hand.\u2019 And OMD were actually from the Wirral. And a Flock of Seagulls weren\u2019t all that. Oh well, nevermind.\u201d No, they were from Seatt- oh, nevermind. 80 min For the first time in this half Liverpool have the game under control, at least relatively speaking. 78 min Salzburg make their final substitution (unless it goes to extra-time). Majeed Ashimeru replaces Zlatko Junuzovic. 76 min Okugawa drives straight at Adrian from 20 yards. It was a decent chance, because he\u2019d made space for himself by cutting inside Alexander-Arnold. He could also have played a reverse pass to put Haaland through on goal. 75 min Whatever happens in the next 15 minutes, Salzburg will be dining out on this game for years, and quite right too. Some of their attacking play has been gloriously intrepid. 72 min Mane misses from a yard. It was an ingenious corner from Alexander-Arnold, similiar to the Origi goal against Barcelona, but the ball had so much pace on it that it flashed straight past Mane\u2019s face as it bounced up at the near post. The corner was so well disguised that the goalkeeper was further away from goal than Mane. 71 min A Salzburg change: the Hungarian teenager Dominik Szoboszlai is replaced by Masaya Okugawa. Salzburg couldn\u2019t get out of their third for a minute or so, and they eventually paid the price. Fabinho won the ball off Szoboszlai and lobbed it to the edge of the area in the same movement. Firmino headed it cleverly into space and Salah steered the bouncing ball past Stankovic. Salah does Salzburg. 68 min Much better from Liverpool. After a good passing move, Robertson\u2019s dangerous cross is put behind by Onguene. But Milner\u2019s delivery is poor and Haaland nuts it clear. 66 min Liverpool are all over the place. You\u2019d expect them to come round soon enough, such is their quality, but right now Salzburg are the calmer, more confident side. 64 min Divock Origi, the Champions League specialist, replaces Gini Wijnaldum. 63 min Salzburg have now scored nine goals in 150 minutes of Champions League football this season. 62 min James Milner comes on for Jordan Henderson. Salzburg have been absolutely sensational in the last 10 minutes, and now Erling Braut Haaland has equalised. Hwang\u2019s speculative reverse from the right beat Fabinho and came to Minamino on the right of the area. He pushed it past van Dijk and drove a low cross into the six-yard box, where Haaland was waiting to tap the ball into an open goal. Their coach, the American Jesse Marsch, went flying down the touchline to join in the celebration and was booked. Like he\u2019ll care. This is epic stuff, a reverse Istanbul. This is incredible! 59 min What a chance for Szoboszlai! He was put through by Hwang, eight yards out, but dithered and eventually pushed a shot just wide of the near post. He was then flagged offside, but replays showed he wasn\u2019t so the goal would have counted. 57 min Salzburg play their trump card: Erling Braut Haaland replaces Patson Daka. Hwang moved into space down the left and picked out a precise cross to the edge of the area, where Minamino slammed an excellent volley into the ground that kicked up to beat Adrian. Another superb goal has brought Salzburg back into the match! 55 min Gomez makes a vital last-ditch tackle on Szoboszlai, who was in the act of shooting from 10 yards. Liverpool break and Mane has a shot superbly glocked at the other end. This is great stuff. 54 min And now a good chance for Liverpool. Mane, who has been brilliant, beats two men on the left and tees up Wijnaldum, who sidefoots a rising shot just wide of the far post from 15 yards. 53 min Another chance for Salzburg! Minamino drives a deep cross/pass to Szoboszlai just inside the area on the left. He plays it lovingly into the path of Hwang, whose mishits shot dribbles well wide. 50 min \u201cSpeaking as a cowed and chastened Spurs fan, I am so jealous of this superb Liverpool team,\u201d writes Jill O\u2019Donnell. \u201cIf Jurgen decides to take his sabbatical, do you think he could be persuaded to coach my team by e-mail and text from his spa retreat?\u201d I\u2019m not sure the consideration of Serge Aurier, Eric Dier et al would be entirely beneficial to the wellness experience. 49 min Adrian almost makes a Karius of himself. He received a backpass from Gomez, dummied to hoof it clear and tried a nonchalant return pass which hit the stretching Daka and went just wide. 47 min \u201cHave to agree with you that this is the best Liverpool side I\u2019ve seen in some 25 years of regularly watching them,\u201d says Hubert O\u2019Hearn. \u201cBut you know, while Klopp is one of the great managers, I never would have fired Brendan Rodgers. There was a falling off after 2014, sure, but you don\u2019t lose Suarez and Sterling and not have a falling off. Saturday is going to be quite interesting \u2013 Brendan\u2019s revenge game with a Leicester side firing on all cylinders. If James Maddison is healthy I think it ends in a draw and a loss would not shock me silly.\u201d 46 min Peep peep! Liverpool begin the second half. Half-time reading Peep peep! That was as much fun as we hoped. There were some fine goals, with Andy Robertson\u2019s the pick, and the scoreline is about right. See you in 10 minutes for the second half. 42 min Maybe it had become a bit too easy for Liverpool. The goal stemmed from a sloppy pass by Henderson (I think). Salzburg deserve this, and it\u2019s a fine goal too. Hwang surges through the inside-left channel into the penalty area, twists back inside van Dijk and lashes a shot into the far corner. 39 min Another half chance for Salzburg. The excellent Minamino pushes a pass into Daka in the D; he spins the ball past Gomez and smacks a shot over the bar. Another one. Mane\u2019s cross is flicked towards goal by the head of Firmino. Stankovic pushes it straight out to Salah, who does the necessary from eight yards. That wasn\u2019t great goalkeeping. 34 min Salzburg work a short corner, from which Wober heads wide. He was offside anyway. Salzburg are still attacking with puppy-dog enthusiasm, despite the imminent pasting. 33 min Kristensen beats Alexander-Arnold, moonlighting at left-back, to win a corner. 31 min The lively Minamino forces a decent save from Adrian. Salzburg worked the ball well: Hwang found Szoboszlai, who slid a pass down the inside-left channel for Minamino. He held off Alexander-Arnold and screwed a left-footed shot towards the near post that was pushed behind by Adrian. 30 min Fabinho clips a lovely pass over the top to find Salah, who thrashes a half-volley wide from 14 yards. He probably should have scored. Fabinho has quietly become the most important player in Liverpool\u2019s midfield. 28 min It\u2019s not news, but Liverpool are a seriously good football team. This is comfortably their best side since 1987-88. Robertson started the move with a surging run past Minamino and over the halfway line. He slipped the ball square to Henderson, who played a one-two with Salah and slid a first-time pass into space for Alexander-Arnold. He crossed first-time towards the near post where Robertson, who had kept running, opened his body to steer it past Stankovic from close range. It was a very accomplished finish as well. That\u2019s sheer delightful football. This is another beautiful goal, a celebration of one-touch football. 24 min Liverpool look very comfortable at the moment. Salzburg haven\u2019t played poorly by any means but there is a difference in class. 20 min Alexander-Arnold\u2019s cross is too close to Stankovic. It\u2019s been a fairly dull game so far, that excellent goal notwithstanding. 18 min Szoboszlai plays a good ball to Hwang, who faffs just outside the area and loses the ball. It comes to Miramino, who is muscled off it with ease by Robertson. The crowd enjoyed it. 17 min Hwang gets the wrong side of Gomez, who pulls him back just outside the area. The referee gives nothing. 16 min It\u2019s such a shame that Haaland is unwell and only on the bench. I suppose it doesn\u2019t matter in the grand scheme - Salzburg probably budgeted to lose this game regardless - but it would have been nice to see him kick a football. 15 min \u201cI\u2019m lying in bed with multiple illnesses, too ill to try and see if the game is on free TV, so I\u2019m hanging on your every MBM post!\u201d says Sam Metta Bexar. \u201cAnd then a spoonful of Mane appears to make the medicine go down. That man is on fi-yah.\u201d It\u2019s an odd thing to say about a key man in arguably the best team in the world, but it feels like Mane is still a bit underrated. 13 min After a neat passing move from Salzburg, Minamino tries a pirouette on the edge of the box and is dispossessed by Robertson. That was an important piece of defending because he was the last man. Sadio Mane scores against his old club. He picked the ball up on the left wing, 40 yards from goal, and immediately charged infield towards goal. He ran past Kristensen, played a slick one-two with Firmino on the edge of the box and slid the ball past Stankovic from close range. That was so decisive and so clean; Salzburg didn\u2019t feel a thing. There was a VAR check for offside but he was just okay. And no, since you asked, he didn\u2019t celebrate. This is a fantastic goal. 7 min Liverpool are starting to pin Salzburg back. Alexander-Arnold curls a superb ball into the area towards Firmino, who is shaping to shoot when Onguene gets a slight but vital touch to divert the ball away. 4 min Salzburg have started with intent, as we thought they would. Their defence doesn\u2019t exactly look watertight, but this should be an enjoyable, end-to-end game until Liverpool get their fouirth. 3 min Minamino picks up a loose ball 25 yards from goal, gets it out of his feet and whistles a low shot just wide of the near post. Adrian probably had it covered but it was a fine effort. 36 secs A promising early move from Liverpool. Henderson sweeps a pass across the field to Mane, who plays in the overlapping Robertson on the left of the area. He is motoring to such an extet, however, that he leaves the ball behind. 1 min Peep peep! Salzburg, in their black away kit, kick off from left to right. Liverpool are in red. Chelsea are also in action tonight, with a tricky trip to Lille. Ben Fisher is watching that one. Another email! \u201cBack in the day when eggs were eggs Liverpool used to sign players on the basis of who they hated playing against,\u201d says Ian Copestake. \u201cGoing for Mane seemed to herald a revival of that non-stat based approach to who to spend big on as he fair murdered us at home. Having watched Koulibaly be a rock of a defender against Liverpool I can\u2019t help but imagine him alongside Virgil. But Lovren is obviously fine also.\u201d Where does the signing of Jimmy Carter fit into that philosophy? An email! \u201cAs Liverpool are the reigning champions of England the whole nation is behind them, but from here in Norway I do hope we get to see what some of the fuss is about regarding The Beast,\u201d says Duncan Edwards. \u201cI doubt very much that he\u2019s injured, just a sensible manager holding him back until Jordan Henderson has kicked someone else\u2019s ankle first.\u201d Genk 0-0 Napoli The other game in this group has finished goalless, which is a decent result for Liverpool and Salzburg. (And Genk as well.) In other news, the Sextuple is stil on Liverpool\u2019s home record borders on the obscene. The last time they lost a Premier or Champions League at Anfield was 23 April 2017, when Christian Benteke scored twice for Crystal Palace in a 2-1 win. They\u2019ve never lost at home in Europe under Jurgen Klopp. Pre-match reading Jurgen Klopp picks his strongest possible side, with Joe Gomez replacing the injured Joel Matip. Erling Braut Haaland is only fit enough for a place on the Salzburg bench. Liverpool (4-3-3) Adrian; Alexander-Arnold, Gomez, van Dijk, Robertson; Henderson, Fabinho, Wijnaldum; Salah, Firmino, Mane. Substitutes: Kelleher, Lovren, Milner, Keita, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Lallana, Origi. Red Bull Salzburg (4-2-2-2) Stankovic; Kristensen, Onguene, Wober, Ulmer; Mwepu, Junuzovic; Minamino, Szoboszlai; Daka, Hwang. Substitutes: Coronel, Ashimeru, Koita, Ramalho, Farkas, Haaland, Okugawa. Referee Andreas Ekberg (Sweden). Hello. Now, this match should be a lot of fun. It\u2019s the European champions against Europe\u2019s form team; the irresistible force vs the irresistible force. And while most of Salzburg\u2019s good results have come in the relatively weak Austrian Bundesliga, it\u2019s still eye-catching stuff.

Haaland looks like the next big Red Bull Salzburg export. Liverpool know all about their ability to find future stars, as Sadio Mane and Naby Keita both spent two years at the club in their formative years. The Salzburg squad is full of promising youngsters from Africa, Asia, South America and Europe, and their starting line-up tonight should have an average age of around 22. Liverpool should be too big a step up in class, but the Salzburg players won\u2019t die wondering. They\u2019ll take plenty of confidence from their recent results in Europe an\u2019 all. In the last two years they have beaten, over one leg or two, Napoli, Borussia Dortmund, Marseille, Real Sociedad, Lazio, Celtic, Red Star Belgrade and RB Leipzig. If they add Liverpool to the list tonight, we won\u2019t be able to move for hipsters who have supported them since they were called SV Casino Salzburg, and that actually, mate, their first really big win in Europe was against Sporting Lisbon in 1993-94, when they overcame a 2-0 first-leg deficit and got Bobby Robson the sack.

I thought our performance was really good. We controlled the early period. Set pieces were a problem but we deserved to win.\u201d</p> <p>Lampard praised his youngsters for surviving their first experience of playing away in Europe, though there will have to be an improvement in possession and in defence when Chelsea visit Ajax on 23 October. Once again their marking at set pieces left much to be desired and they made life difficult for themselves when Victor Osimhen, Lille\u2019s biggest threat, cancelled out Abraham\u2019s opener with a free header in the 33rd minute. Kurt Zouma was at fault, losing the striker from Jonathan Bamba\u2019s corner.</p> <p>Chelsea have only kept one clean sheet this season and their back three endured some shaky moments. Zouma erred when the game was goalless, putting his team in trouble with a poor backpass that nearly let in Osimhen.Fikayo Tomori almost gifted Lille a late equaliser. Kepa Arrizabalaga, Chelsea\u2019s goalkeeper, would also get away with one in stoppage time.</p> <p>Arrizabalaga did make some important saves at crucial times, though, and Chelsea were able to focus on the positives in the end. They started well, with Lampard\u2019s decision to switch to a 3-4-2-1 system giving his team control, and they were ahead after 22 minutes. N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9, fit to start in midfield after shaking off a hamstring injury, combined with Tomori, who found Abraham.

Beaten in their opening game in Group H, they had bounced back and drawn level on points with second-placed Valencia, who were beaten 3-0 at home by Ajax. \u201cThere\u2019s a long way to go but having lost against Valencia it put more importance on this game,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cIt\u2019s such a tough place, the roof was on, the crowd were up for it. I thought our performance was really good. We controlled the early period. Set pieces were a problem but we deserved to win.\u201d Lampard praised his youngsters for surviving their first experience of playing away in Europe, though there will have to be an improvement in possession and in defence when Chelsea visit Ajax on 23 October. Once again their marking at set pieces left much to be desired and they made life difficult for themselves when Victor Osimhen, Lille\u2019s biggest threat, cancelled out Abraham\u2019s opener with a free header in the 33rd minute. Kurt Zouma was at fault, losing the striker from Jonathan Bamba\u2019s corner. Chelsea have only kept one clean sheet this season and their back three endured some shaky moments. Zouma erred when the game was goalless, putting his team in trouble with a poor backpass that nearly let in Osimhen.Fikayo Tomori almost gifted Lille a late equaliser. Kepa Arrizabalaga, Chelsea\u2019s goalkeeper, would also get away with one in stoppage time. Arrizabalaga did make some important saves at crucial times, though, and Chelsea were able to focus on the positives in the end. They started well, with Lampard\u2019s decision to switch to a 3-4-2-1 system giving his team control, and they were ahead after 22 minutes. N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9, fit to start in midfield after shaking off a hamstring injury, combined with Tomori, who found Abraham. Played a yard onside by Reinildo Mandava, the striker turned smartly and his accurate finish showed why he is likely to be called up by England on Thursday. \u201cHe got his cake earlier,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cWe\u2019re on the ball. Him and Michy Batshuayi, it\u2019s both their birthday. We had two cakes for them last night. Tammy is hungry for goals, physical, but there\u2019s improvement to be had. But for the minute he\u2019s doing well. It was his first Champions League goal and I hope we\u2019ll see many more.\u201d Chelsea\u2019s inexperience began to show after Osimhen\u2019s goal, even if they were close to regaining their lead when Jorginho clipped the woodwork from 25 yards. There had been a huge show of confidence from Lampard in Reece James, whose second appearance for Chelsea came a week after his goalscoring debut in last week\u2019s Carabao Cup win over Grimsby Town, but Lille were quick to run at the 19-year-old right wing-back. James was booked before the interval for a lunge on Jonathan Ikon\u00e9. The quality dipped during the second half and Christian Pulisic, a \u00a358m signing from Borussia Dortmund, must have felt aggrieved not to have made the bench when he saw Chelsea huffing and puffing in the final third. There was also no place in the 18 for Ross Barkley, who had been forced to apologise for rowing with a taxi driver during a night out in Liverpool on Sunday. Lampard made his first change in the 67th minute, replacing James with Hudson-Odoi, and the introduction of the winger led to an improvement. Mason Mount stirred, wriggling into the area and forcing Mike Maignan to save. With 12 minutes left Hudson-Odoi ran at Lille on the left and lifted a deep cross to the far post, where Willian was watching and waiting. He drew his right foot back, met the cross on the full and Chelsea had their breakthrough.",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson\u2019s plan for an alternative to the backstop appeared to be edging towards a parliamentary majority on Wednesday night following expressions of support from a handful of Labour MPs, hardliners in the European Research Group (ERG) and the DUP. As the prime minister frantically called EU leaders, including Jean-Claude Juncker, Angela Merkel and Leo Varadkar, outriders for No 10 approached potential supporters in parliament seeking their backing. If Johnson is able to get a deal through parliament by 19 October, with the support of 322 MPs, it would release him from his obligations under the so-called Benn act to seek an extension to article 50. Although parliamentary calculations will only become relevant if the EU backs the proposals, the Labour MPs Gareth Snell and Ruth Smeeth, both from leave-voting constituencies, have told the BBC they will back Johnson\u2019s proposals if they are put before parliament. Having seen Theresa May\u2019s deal collapse after failing to win over 34 members of the ERG, No 10 will be heartened that the group\u2019s chair, Steve Baker, gave the proposals a cautious welcome. He told the BBC that they represented \u201ca great place to be starting\u201d but they only dealt with issues to do with the Northern Irish border and not the full scope of future ties with the EU. John Redwood, one of the most hardline Eurosceptics, said Johnson\u2019s commitment to a free trade agreement with the EU is \u201cvery significant\u201d. \u201cI have always said we should offer a free trade agreement. On the fundamentals I am very pleased with that,\u201d he said. Johnson has set out details of his plan to replace the Irish border backstop, the controversial insurance policy that is meant to keep a free-flowing border on the island of Ireland. Under Johnson\u2019s proposals, which he calls a \u201cbroad landing zone\u201d for a new deal, Northern Ireland would leave the EU\u2019s customs union alongside the rest of the UK at the start of 2021 but would continue to apply EU legislation relating to agricultural and other products \u2013 what he calls an \u201call-island regulatory zone\u201d. The Guardian revealed on Tuesday that the prime minister had crucially won over the support of Arlene Foster, the leader of the DUP, who said the ability of the Stormont assembly to opt in and out of the tabled all-Ireland regulatory arrangements for goods was the \u201cbig difference\u201d from Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal deal. Political rivals have accused the DUP of backing down on its vehement opposition to any agreement that resulted in a new regulatory border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. But Foster, arriving back in Belfast after attending the Conservative party conference in Manchester, insisted the bigger role for Stormont, even though it has not been functioning for more than two years, provided the democratic accountability she desired. \u201cWe believe this is a serious and sensible way forward to have engagement with the European Union in a way that allows us all in the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, therefore we will be supporting this plan. \u201cWhat it does is allow us to leave the European Union customs union, it allows us to leave the single market and then we opt in if we are not in the position to put in alternative arrangements at that time,\u201d she said. In a House of Commons in which 322 MPs are needed for a majority, the Conservatives now have only 288 MPs and have relied upon the support of 10 DUP MPs. In March the Commons rejected eight different proposals setting out plans for withdrawal. It also rejected, three times, May\u2019s deal with the EU. Since Johnson became prime minister in July, the Commons has defeated the government on seven key votes. Jeremy Corbyn said the deal was \u201cnot acceptable\u201d and worse than May\u2019s agreement, as it \u201cundermined\u201d the Good Friday agreement that secured peace in Northern Ireland. Opponents of Brexit in parliament indicated they would not support the proposals unless they were accompanied by the promise of another referendum. The Liberal Democrats, who want to stop Brexit, said the proposals would deal a \u201chammer blow\u201d to the Northern Irish economy. The Scottish National party dismissed the proposals as \u201cwindow dressing\u201d.",

But she is in no way comparable to Diana, because she has been much better shielded, and she\u2019s in a much less vulnerable position, and a much less vulnerable person.\u201d</p> <p>PR consultant Mark Borkowski said the statement risked the pair being \u201ca little too open about what they think about the media\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe royals normally keep the media at arm\u2019s length but this is not an arm\u2019s length move. Harry is determined not to play the media game. There is no charm left, this is an open declaration of war,\u201d he told PA. \u201cHe has drawn a line in the sand and that line has been crossed. There will be a lot of people who support him, but he will also be losing a lot of friends.\u201d</p> <p>It is not the first time Harry has moved to defend Meghan\u2019s over her treatment by the media. In November 2016, he confirmed he was dating the US actor and lashed out at the \u201cwave of abuse and harassment\u201d she had faced from publications.</p> <p>His communications secretary Jason Knauf outlined the difficulties Meghan had experienced since news of their relationship broke in a statement which said she had been \u201csubject to a wave of abuse and harassment\u201d. <br></p>",

I really, really question the wisdom of taking on the media in this way.\u201d The BBC\u2019s royal editor, Nicholas Witchell, said the timing was \u201ccurious\u201d given the visit has been a \u201cconsiderable success\u201d and had lifted the couple\u2019s reputation \u201cafter a series of mis-steps involving private jets and expensive property renovations\u201d. The media commentator Roy Greenslade told Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cIs [Harry] taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut here? I think he may well find that this is counter-productive.\u201d Palace sources indicate the timing of the announcement was based on specific legal advice. It is understood the claim was filed on Sunday 29 September, and processed by the court on Monday. The particulars of the claim would need to be served within 14 days, and within another 14 days, the claims documents would be accessible to the public. While this may explain the timing on the announcement of legal action, it does not, however, fully explain the timing or content of Harry\u2019s statement. Law firm Schillings, acting for the Duchess, has filed a high court claim against the paper and its parent company \u2013 Associated Newspapers \u2013 over the alleged misuse of private information, infringement of copyright and breach of the Data Protection Act 2018. Harry has also accused the paper of misleading readers by strategically omitting paragraphs, sentences and specific words \u2013 \u201cto mask the lies they had perpetrated for over a year\u201d. The newspaper denies this. \u201cThe paparazzi in Diana\u2019s day wanted to elicit a negative reaction, wanted her to burst into tears or lash out,\u201d said Stephen Bates, author of Royalty Inc . \u201cI think the coverage has been pretty snippy about Meghan, sometimes with reasonable cause, private jets and all that. But she is in no way comparable to Diana, because she has been much better shielded, and she\u2019s in a much less vulnerable position, and a much less vulnerable person.\u201d PR consultant Mark Borkowski said the statement risked the pair being \u201ca little too open about what they think about the media\u201d. \u201cThe royals normally keep the media at arm\u2019s length but this is not an arm\u2019s length move. Harry is determined not to play the media game. There is no charm left, this is an open declaration of war,\u201d he told PA. \u201cHe has drawn a line in the sand and that line has been crossed. There will be a lot of people who support him, but he will also be losing a lot of friends.\u201d It is not the first time Harry has moved to defend Meghan\u2019s over her treatment by the media. In November 2016, he confirmed he was dating the US actor and lashed out at the \u201cwave of abuse and harassment\u201d she had faced from publications. His communications secretary Jason Knauf outlined the difficulties Meghan had experienced since news of their relationship broke in a statement which said she had been \u201csubject to a wave of abuse and harassment\u201d.",

Welcome to day 6 of our coverage at the athletics world championships in Doha. </strong>Today is a particularly special day as it marks day one of the brutal multi-events. In the heptathlon, Britain\u2019s Katarina Johnson-Thompson is looking to secure her first outdoor world medal as she continues her rivalry with Nafi Thiam, while decathlon world record holder Kevin Mayer will be the favourite as he tries to defend his title.

Can Dina Asher-Smith get it done? It doesn\u2019t seem likely that anyone will match the world class standards she has set all year, but this is a major final and she will have to handle being the clear favourite at this stage for the first time in her life. We\u2019ll see if she is up to the task.<br></p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for me on day 6. Please enjoy Sean Ingle\u2019s full story on Dina Asher-Smith\u2019s history making. Good night. Another dramatic, delirious night ends with the 400 metres decathlon heats. Canada\u2019s Damian Warner stands in the lead with a score of 4513. World record holder Kevin Mayer surprisingly sits in third place, 31 points behind Warner. But some of his best events are to come on the second day. In the men\u2019s hammer throw, Pawel Fajdek of Poland wins in 80.50. Quentin Bigot of France takes silver, Bence Halasz bronze. There was also some drama as Britain\u2019s Nick Miller produced a monstrous throw, but it was narrowly ruled a foul. Grant Holloway, 110 metres hurdles champion, was speaking to the BBC: A lot of people counted me out when I came into this meet just because I had off races for about a month. But when you believe in God and you\u2019ve got grit in yourself, you can never lose. When asked about the dramatics behind him, Holloway had six words: My lane, my space, my hurdles. Here is Sean Ingle\u2019s story on Dina Asher-Smith\u2019s glorious win. She is just the seventh British woman to win a world title. Spare a thought for Orlando Ortega, who was second in the 110 metres hurdles until McLeod stumbled into him and arrested his momentum. The Spaniard will never want to see McLeod in a neighbouring lane again. An emotional Asher-Smith to the BBC: I just don\u2019t know what to say. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s properly sunk in. Between now and the last world championships, John and I knew I could do it but it\u2019s a different thing actually going and doing it. To run 10.83 and 21.88 being tired! It\u2019s been a long champs. It means so much. I was tired but I woke up today thinking, \u2018Well this is it!\u2019 Obviously I\u2019ve got the relay, but this is the last of your individual. This is the moment you did all your work for. This is what we knew that we could achieve if the season went well but obviously the tiredness disappeared when we needed it to. It means so much. There\u2019s so many British fans here. I don\u2019t know [if] there\u2019s a lot of British people [living] in Doha but I know loads have traveled. For my mum to be here, my dad, John and his wife, my physio and everything it means honestly so much. Sorry, normally, I\u2019m quite chatty and full of energy but I\u2019m lost for words because it\u2019s a different thing with everybody being like, \u2018ah, you\u2019re the favourite\u2019. But you\u2019ve still got to go and do it. You\u2019re only the favourite if you perform as people expect you to. So, I was just really focused on putting together a great race. I dreamed of it but now it\u2019s real. And on those final words, she teared up again. Lovely. Grant Holloway of the United States wins the 110 metres hurdles title in 13.10 seconds. Sergey Shubenkov takes second, Pierre Martinot-Lagarde wins bronze. Defending champion Omar McLeod clatters into the hurdle and falls! Dina Asher-Smith is in tears on the BBC. \u201cNormally, I\u2019m quite chatty and everything but I\u2019m lost for words,\u201d she says. The gap. The women\u2019s 200m podium: Dina Asher-Smith (GBR) - 21.88 NR Brittany Brown (USA) - 22.22 PB Mujinga Kambundji (SUI) - 22.51 Two Europeans on the podium. What sweet redemption for Kambundji, who missed the 100 metres final by one thousandth of a second. What a race. Asher-Smith\u2019s record has been rounded down to 21.88. A new, glorious British record. Two finals, two British record. That is how you handle the pressure. Dina Asher-Smith wins the 200m world title in 21.89 seconds! Here we go. The women\u2019s 200 metres finalists are heading out. Here are the top three highest times in 2019 from this field: Dina Asher Smith (22.08) Anglerne Annelus (22.16) Mujinga Kambundji (22.26) It\u2019s almost time for Dina. Could be worse. Katarina Johnson-Thompson\u2019s first day score of 4138 is the fourth best opening day in heptathlon history. Nafi Thiam sits in second with 4042 points. Katarina Johnson-Thompson finishes a great day by winning her 200 metres heat with a solid 23.08. She\u2019ll go into day two with a lead of 96 points. Nafi Thiam wins the opening 200 metres heptathlon heat with a run of 24.60. That was decent, but not the Belgian\u2019s best run. Katarina Johnson-Thompson has the opportunity to finish day one first. \u201cEverything was decent. I didn\u2019t have any event where I screwed up,\u201d says Thiam. As Bence Halasz of Hungary moves into the lead in the men\u2019s hammer throw with a first attempt of 78.18m, the heptathletes are on the track for the 200 metres. Event leader and favourite Thiam will run in the opening heat. One hour until the 200 metres final.. Sydney McLaughlin eases through the third women\u2019s 400 metres hurdle semi-final in 53.81 seconds. The 20 year-old finished just .10 faster than Dalilah Muhammad and the rivalry between the rookie and the Olympic champion will make for some final. Rushell Clayton of Jamaica takes the second semi-final in 54.17 seconds. It was a desperate finish for second place, but Zuzana Hejnova takes second place in 54.41. Ashley Spencer will have a nervous wait to see if her 54.42 is enough for a fast loser spot. Dalilah Muhammad eases, as much as one can ease through a brutal 400 metres hurdles run, into the final with a time of 53.94. Sage Watson takes second in 54.32, a Canadian record. Nice. The 400 metres hurdlers are on the track. Dalilah Muhammad, who set the world record this year, looks to safely reach the final. Michael Norman comes to the BBC and says that he decided to jog all the way home because his body was giving him \u201cwarning signs\u201d. He didn\u2019t specify an injury or illness or clarify anything. It has left Michael Johnson even more perplexed than before: \u201cI don\u2019t know what that was,\u201d he says, shaking his head. Katarina Johnson-Thompson is having a pretty decent day. After two modest attempts in the shot put, she throws a lifetime best of 13.86 and she cannot believe it. Nor can Denise Lewis: \u201cGet in there!\u201d she growls, pumping both of her fists. We have our first huge shock of the night. Michael Norman of the United States, widely considered the 400 metres favourite, finishes in seventh. He started with a solid 100 metres but by the end he was just jogging. Machel Cedenio wins the final semi-final in 44.41. In the BBC studio, Michael Johnson is in shock. The lasts of the 400 metres semi-finalists are on the track. Britain\u2019s Rabah Yousif will try to make the final. It will be difficult. In the second men\u2019s 400 metres semi-final, Steven Gardiner of the Bahamas runs an effortless 44.13, the quickest time so far. Another great showing in second place for Kirani James, who arrived with very few meets in 2019, but remains a classy sprinter. 44.23 for the Grenadian. We\u2019re now onto the shot put, where Katarina Johnson-Thompson just threw a modest 12.33. Nafi Thiam has finally made her mark on the competition with a brilliant throw of 15.22. The men\u2019s 400 metres semi-finals are on the track and Fred Kerley of the United States snatches the opening semi-final in 44.25 seconds. But it was the second qualifier who stole the show as 800 metres runner Emmanuel Korir embarrassed the rest of the sprinters, taking second with a brilliant run of 44.37. The decathletes will now head towards the high jump. The great Kevin Mayer has already made his intentions clear by recording a personal best of 10.50 in the 100 metres and an event-leading 16.82 in the shot put. He stands in first place with 2827 points compared to Warner\u2019s score of 2788. Meanwhile, the women of the heptathlon are heading towards the shot put. It\u2019s early days, but Katarina Johnson-Thompson is having a great day so far. She was overjoyed after running a 13.09 personal best in the 100 metres hurdles, then she jumped 1.95 in the high jump. With a score of 2282, she sits 40 points ahead of Nafi Thiam, who was the only other woman to clear 1.95. Thiam finished the 100 metres hurdles in 13.36. Orlando Ortega takes the third semi-final in 13.16. This means that all the remaining favourites are through and we\u2019re in for a stacked men\u2019s 110 metres hurdles final. Milan Trajkovic of Cyprus took second place in 13.29. In the second semi-final, Omar McLeod of Jamaica tears through to win in 13.08. Much like Shubenkov in the first semi-final, Frenchman Pascal Martinot-Lagarde was closing the leader down and finished in 13.12, but the Jamaican takes the win. Here is Sean Ingle\u2019s piece on Seb Coe, who didn\u2019t have many pleasant things to say about Gabby Logan and BBC\u2019s coverage of the athletics. On the track, it\u2019s time for the men\u2019s 110 metres hurdles semi-finals. Grant Holloway of the United States wins the first semi-final in 13.10, bursting into the lead from the start and holding on to win. However, the great Sergey Shubenkov was closing down at the end and it will be fascinating to see if he can catch the American in the final. A tough race for Britain\u2019s Andrew Pozzi, who finishes 5th with a time of 13.60. Hello! Welcome to day 6 of our coverage at the athletics world championships in Doha.

Housing estates, working-class families, drunk men coming home from the pub. Women surrounded by children and a sequence of shouting followed by immediate physical violence or assault.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut the soap opera scene only tends to focus on one or two aspects of a much bigger and more complex picture.</p> \n<p>\u201cDomestic violence has many faces and the faces of those who survive it are varied too. Sometimes there are no bruises. Abuse is very often all about control and power. It\u2019s about making themselves feel big or biggest.\u201d</p> \n<p>Duffield, a former teaching assistant and political writer, explained that her relationship had been full of romantic gestures at first.</p> \n<p>She said: \u201cThey don\u2019t threaten criticise, yell or exert their physical strength in increasingly frightening ways.</p> \n<p>\u201cNot at the start. Not when they think you\u2019re sweet, funny and gorgeous. Not when they turn up to your third date with chocolates, then jewellery.</p> \n<p>\u201cNot when they meet your friends, or the leader of your political party.\u201d</p> \n<p>Over time she said the verbal intimidation had become more intense, and there were periods of time when her partner would not speak to her at all.</p> \n<p>She claimed he had also moved into her home and had become reliant on her financially, never disclosing his own salary or contributing to bills, and eventually not working at all.</p> \n<p>She said: \u201cYou learn that \u2018I\u2019ll always look after you\u2019 and \u2018You\u2019re mine for life\u2019 can sound menacing, are used as a warning over and over again.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s when the ring is on your finger that the mask can start to slip and the promises sound increasingly like threats.\u201d</p> \n<p>Among the emotional knocks to her confidence were comments like \u201cYour dress was too short\u201d or \u201cThe top you wore in the chamber was too low-cut.\u201d</p> \n<p>Some of the most harrowing detail was her account of a surprise weekend break. She said: \u201cIn a strange city his face changes in a way you are starting to know and dread. In a way that tells you, you need to stay calm, silent and very careful.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou read a city guide \u2026 mentally packing a day full of fun. But he seems to have another agenda.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want you to leave the room. He\u2019s paid a lot of money and you need to pay him your full attention. You are expected to do as you are told. You know for certain what that means, so you do, exactly what you are told.</p> \n<p>\u201cThose patterns continue: reward, punishment, promises of happy ever after, alternating with abject rage, menace, silent treatment and coercive control.\u201d</p> \n<p>Eventually the abuse spilled out in public, with him shouting at her at constituency events, which she said was extremely humiliating.</p> \n<p>For two weeks she timed the moment he took a shower and one morning took his house keys from his bag so that night he was locked out of her house, ending the relationship.</p> \n<p>She finished her account, in which colleagues sat in absolute silence, saying: \u201cYou realise it\u2019s not your fault. He is left alone with his rage and narcissism.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf anyone is watching and needs a friend, please reach out if it safe to do so and please talk to any of us, because we will be there and hold your hand.\u201d</p> \n<p>Labour\u2019s Harriet Harman said: \u201cWhat she said just now will save lives. We are incredibly proud of her.\u201d</p> \n<p>The domestic abuse bill will for the first time include economic control and manipulative non-physical abuse within definitions of domestic abuse.</p> \n<p>It will also introduce new domestic abuse protection notices and domestic abuse protection orders to further protect victims and prohibit the cross-examination of victims by their abusers in the family courts.</p> \n<p>There was a risk that with parliament\u2019s prorogation the bill would not have time to become law.</p> \n<p>During its second reading on Wednesday, Theresa May, who introduced the bill, said it was a \u201conce-in-a-generation\u201d opportunity to make significant change to support victims.</p>",

She said: \u201cOften we see the same images and stereotypes on TV. Housing estates, working-class families, drunk men coming home from the pub. Women surrounded by children and a sequence of shouting followed by immediate physical violence or assault. \u201cBut the soap opera scene only tends to focus on one or two aspects of a much bigger and more complex picture. \u201cDomestic violence has many faces and the faces of those who survive it are varied too. Sometimes there are no bruises. Abuse is very often all about control and power. It\u2019s about making themselves feel big or biggest.\u201d Duffield, a former teaching assistant and political writer, explained that her relationship had been full of romantic gestures at first. She said: \u201cThey don\u2019t threaten criticise, yell or exert their physical strength in increasingly frightening ways. \u201cNot at the start. Not when they think you\u2019re sweet, funny and gorgeous. Not when they turn up to your third date with chocolates, then jewellery. \u201cNot when they meet your friends, or the leader of your political party.\u201d Over time she said the verbal intimidation had become more intense, and there were periods of time when her partner would not speak to her at all. She claimed he had also moved into her home and had become reliant on her financially, never disclosing his own salary or contributing to bills, and eventually not working at all. She said: \u201cYou learn that \u2018I\u2019ll always look after you\u2019 and \u2018You\u2019re mine for life\u2019 can sound menacing, are used as a warning over and over again. \u201cIt\u2019s when the ring is on your finger that the mask can start to slip and the promises sound increasingly like threats.\u201d Among the emotional knocks to her confidence were comments like \u201cYour dress was too short\u201d or \u201cThe top you wore in the chamber was too low-cut.\u201d Some of the most harrowing detail was her account of a surprise weekend break. She said: \u201cIn a strange city his face changes in a way you are starting to know and dread. In a way that tells you, you need to stay calm, silent and very careful. \u201cYou read a city guide \u2026 mentally packing a day full of fun. But he seems to have another agenda. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want you to leave the room. He\u2019s paid a lot of money and you need to pay him your full attention. You are expected to do as you are told. You know for certain what that means, so you do, exactly what you are told. \u201cThose patterns continue: reward, punishment, promises of happy ever after, alternating with abject rage, menace, silent treatment and coercive control.\u201d Eventually the abuse spilled out in public, with him shouting at her at constituency events, which she said was extremely humiliating. For two weeks she timed the moment he took a shower and one morning took his house keys from his bag so that night he was locked out of her house, ending the relationship. She finished her account, in which colleagues sat in absolute silence, saying: \u201cYou realise it\u2019s not your fault. He is left alone with his rage and narcissism. \u201cIf anyone is watching and needs a friend, please reach out if it safe to do so and please talk to any of us, because we will be there and hold your hand.\u201d Labour\u2019s Harriet Harman said: \u201cWhat she said just now will save lives. We are incredibly proud of her.\u201d The domestic abuse bill will for the first time include economic control and manipulative non-physical abuse within definitions of domestic abuse. It will also introduce new domestic abuse protection notices and domestic abuse protection orders to further protect victims and prohibit the cross-examination of victims by their abusers in the family courts. There was a risk that with parliament\u2019s prorogation the bill would not have time to become law. During its second reading on Wednesday, Theresa May, who introduced the bill, said it was a \u201conce-in-a-generation\u201d opportunity to make significant change to support victims.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>Power of the Big Six</strong></h2> <p>When the Premier League was formed in 1992, football clubs were, by and large, owned by local businessmen. Peter Swales, then the chairman of Manchester City, made his money in the Manchester hi-fi trade. These days City are owned by the ruling family of Abu Dhabi and their interests extend beyond \u2013 as was often argued of Swales \u2013 maintaining a sinecure within the Football Association.</p> <p>Today, clubs in the Premier League serve global ambitions, especially at the top. Five of the \u201cBig Six\u201d \u2013 City, Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea \u2013 have foreign owners and the sixth, Tottenham, are owned by a Briton but belong to a company registered in the Bahamas. Keeping these clubs happy and pulling in the same direction will be Pemsel\u2019s biggest task.</p> <p>The key to it all will be money. Last year, the Big Six managed to negotiate a bigger share of the revenue generated by overseas television rights. That, for a moment, put a stop to simmering speculation about a breakaway league. But an appetite for getting what the biggest clubs see as their fair share of the Premier League\u2019s spoils is not about to go away.</p> <h2><strong>TV deals/overseas growth</strong></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/oct/02/premier-league-david-pemsel-chief-executive-guardian\">Premier League appoints Guardian's David Pemsel as chief executive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Under the leadership of Richard Scudamore, who served first as chief executive then executive chairman for 20 years, the Premier League was something of a media miracle. In 1992 the 20 clubs between them made \u00a315m from broadcasting revenue. By the 2018\u201119 season that figure had risen to just under \u00a33bn. In the UK, through a long-term partnership with Sky, and abroad, through a series of country-specific deals, Scudamore revolutionised the relationship between sport and broadcasting, turning football into a brand of entertainment.</p> <p>The concern facing Pemsel, however, is that the good times might well be coming to an end. The most recent domestic TV deal, struck last year and running from this season until 2022, generated \u00a30.5bn less than in the previous cycle. Overseas revenues meanwhile rose 35% overall, but much of that growth can be explained by the collapse of the pound against the dollar and there were alarming numbers from Asia where rights in countries such as Japan and South Korea fell in value by as much as 50%.</p> <p>Some of this can be explained by the Premier League losing its first mover advantage; every major sport from the NBA to cricket is looking to maximise international audiences. But there is also a deeper systemic change, as audiences move from traditional broadcasters to online platforms. Digital piracy is already a huge problem for the Premier League, and there is concern that no future relationship with any digital player, be it Facebook, Netflix or Amazon, will ever match up to that forged with Sky. Amazon purchased one package of UK rights in the current deal and will show 20 matches this season. The figure they paid for those rights was undisclosed.</p> <h2><strong>Home-grown players/Brexit</strong></h2> <p>Of the 220 players starting last weekend\u2019s Premier League fixtures only 73 were eligible to play for England. This 33% figure is actually an improvement on the numbers quoted last year by the England manager, Gareth Southgate, when only 54, or 25%, made the cut on a matchday in December. Every stakeholder in the game \u2013 Premier League clubs included \u2013 agrees they want more English players in the top flight. Squaring that desire with a need for constant competitiveness has proven difficult.</p> <p>Under Scudamore the Premier League was always resistant to limiting the number of foreign imports, claiming rightly that they had been intrinsic to the growth of the game. Ironically Brexit may provide a solution, with tighter immigration rules for EU players likely. That said, there is concern that football clubs are ill-prepared for an exit from the EU, another potential headache for Pemsel.</p> <h2><strong>The FA and the EFL</strong></h2> <p>In public at least, relationships between the three biggest bodies in English football are in a healthy state. The FA\u2019s Martin Glenn and EFL\u2019s Shaun Harvey accepted the Premier League as the dominant partner and sought to work with, rather than fight against, it. But Pemsel is not the only new chief executive in town. Mark Bullingham took over from Glenn at the FA last month while the EFL is searching for a replacement for Harvey. The nature of relations between the three will be a subject of great interest to onlookers.</p> <p>Scudamore\u2019s reign was not only characterised by great financial success but also by laissez-faire tendencies. The amount of \u201csolidarity\u201d money shared with EFL clubs is only a small fraction of the Premier League\u2019s great revenues, while the fallout from any on-field controversies (off-field too) were left to the FA to clear up. In recent months, meanwhile, the Premier League has been seen to be behind the curve in modernising the game. Both the FA and EFL have taken steps to fix the astonishing lack of diversity in coaching roles, with the EFL implementing a version of the Rooney rule that would require at least one BAME candidate to be interviewed for every job. The Premier League has so far remained entirely silent on the matter, a response not atypical of the Scudamore years more generally.</p> <h2><strong>Gambling</strong></h2> <p>Football has a gambling problem and the Premier League is up to its neck in bookmaker money. Half of the teams wear a bookmaker\u2019s or casino\u2019s logo on their shirt and all but three have some kind of financial association with a gambling firm. Once again, the Premier League has been hands\u2011off when it comes to how clubs make their money but there are signs this approach might prove ill-advised. There are thought to be nearly half a million people in the UK with a gambling problem and another 1.5 million at risk of developing one, and academic studies suggest the \u201cgamblification\u201d of football is contributing to the problem. With politicians and even some gambling companies calling for advertising limits in and around the game, pressure for change is likely to continue to grow.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Power of the Big Six When the Premier League was formed in 1992, football clubs were, by and large, owned by local businessmen. Peter Swales, then the chairman of Manchester City, made his money in the Manchester hi-fi trade. These days City are owned by the ruling family of Abu Dhabi and their interests extend beyond \u2013 as was often argued of Swales \u2013 maintaining a sinecure within the Football Association. Today, clubs in the Premier League serve global ambitions, especially at the top. Five of the \u201cBig Six\u201d \u2013 City, Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea \u2013 have foreign owners and the sixth, Tottenham, are owned by a Briton but belong to a company registered in the Bahamas. Keeping these clubs happy and pulling in the same direction will be Pemsel\u2019s biggest task. The key to it all will be money. Last year, the Big Six managed to negotiate a bigger share of the revenue generated by overseas television rights. That, for a moment, put a stop to simmering speculation about a breakaway league. But an appetite for getting what the biggest clubs see as their fair share of the Premier League\u2019s spoils is not about to go away. TV deals/overseas growth Under the leadership of Richard Scudamore, who served first as chief executive then executive chairman for 20 years, the Premier League was something of a media miracle. In 1992 the 20 clubs between them made \u00a315m from broadcasting revenue. By the 2018\u201119 season that figure had risen to just under \u00a33bn. In the UK, through a long-term partnership with Sky, and abroad, through a series of country-specific deals, Scudamore revolutionised the relationship between sport and broadcasting, turning football into a brand of entertainment. The concern facing Pemsel, however, is that the good times might well be coming to an end. The most recent domestic TV deal, struck last year and running from this season until 2022, generated \u00a30.5bn less than in the previous cycle. Overseas revenues meanwhile rose 35% overall, but much of that growth can be explained by the collapse of the pound against the dollar and there were alarming numbers from Asia where rights in countries such as Japan and South Korea fell in value by as much as 50%. Some of this can be explained by the Premier League losing its first mover advantage; every major sport from the NBA to cricket is looking to maximise international audiences. But there is also a deeper systemic change, as audiences move from traditional broadcasters to online platforms. Digital piracy is already a huge problem for the Premier League, and there is concern that no future relationship with any digital player, be it Facebook, Netflix or Amazon, will ever match up to that forged with Sky. Amazon purchased one package of UK rights in the current deal and will show 20 matches this season. The figure they paid for those rights was undisclosed. Home-grown players/Brexit Of the 220 players starting last weekend\u2019s Premier League fixtures only 73 were eligible to play for England. This 33% figure is actually an improvement on the numbers quoted last year by the England manager, Gareth Southgate, when only 54, or 25%, made the cut on a matchday in December. Every stakeholder in the game \u2013 Premier League clubs included \u2013 agrees they want more English players in the top flight. Squaring that desire with a need for constant competitiveness has proven difficult. Under Scudamore the Premier League was always resistant to limiting the number of foreign imports, claiming rightly that they had been intrinsic to the growth of the game. Ironically Brexit may provide a solution, with tighter immigration rules for EU players likely. That said, there is concern that football clubs are ill-prepared for an exit from the EU, another potential headache for Pemsel. The FA and the EFL In public at least, relationships between the three biggest bodies in English football are in a healthy state. The FA\u2019s Martin Glenn and EFL\u2019s Shaun Harvey accepted the Premier League as the dominant partner and sought to work with, rather than fight against, it. But Pemsel is not the only new chief executive in town. Mark Bullingham took over from Glenn at the FA last month while the EFL is searching for a replacement for Harvey. The nature of relations between the three will be a subject of great interest to onlookers. Scudamore\u2019s reign was not only characterised by great financial success but also by laissez-faire tendencies. The amount of \u201csolidarity\u201d money shared with EFL clubs is only a small fraction of the Premier League\u2019s great revenues, while the fallout from any on-field controversies (off-field too) were left to the FA to clear up. In recent months, meanwhile, the Premier League has been seen to be behind the curve in modernising the game. Both the FA and EFL have taken steps to fix the astonishing lack of diversity in coaching roles, with the EFL implementing a version of the Rooney rule that would require at least one BAME candidate to be interviewed for every job. The Premier League has so far remained entirely silent on the matter, a response not atypical of the Scudamore years more generally. Gambling Football has a gambling problem and the Premier League is up to its neck in bookmaker money. Half of the teams wear a bookmaker\u2019s or casino\u2019s logo on their shirt and all but three have some kind of financial association with a gambling firm. Once again, the Premier League has been hands\u2011off when it comes to how clubs make their money but there are signs this approach might prove ill-advised. There are thought to be nearly half a million people in the UK with a gambling problem and another 1.5 million at risk of developing one, and academic studies suggest the \u201cgamblification\u201d of football is contributing to the problem. With politicians and even some gambling companies calling for advertising limits in and around the game, pressure for change is likely to continue to grow.",

Sources said Scappaticci and the others on the files form \u201cpart of the evidence to be considered\u201d by the PPS.</p> <p>Scappaticci has always denied that he is Stakeknife ever since he was allegedly outed as a British agent in 2003. He is alleged to have been the IRA\u2019s chief spycatcher, the head of its internal security unit known within Irish republican circles as \u201cthe nutting squad\u201d or \u201cthe head-hunters\u201d. The unit was the most feared and supposedly secretive branch of the IRA during the conflict.</p> <p>The Stakeknife scandal centres on the allegation that while he was working for the British Army\u2019s intelligence branch, the Force Research Unit (FRU), the agent was allowed by his military handlers to commit crimes including torture and murder.</p> <p>It is alleged that Stakeknife is directly linked to 18 murders of IRA members accused of being informers and that the mole-hunting unit he headed was responsible for 30 deaths overall.</p> <p>A number of families of IRA members shot dead after being accused of treachery have made separate complaints to Northern Ireland\u2019s police ombudsman, claiming that Stakeknife\u2019s handlers in the security forces failed to use their agent to prevent the killings.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Operation Kenova and Boutcher confirmed that files have now been sent to the PPS in Belfast. The spokesperson based at the Bedfordshire constabulary declined to confirm or deny that Scappaticci and more than 20 others have been named as potential suspects for the PPS to charge.</p> <p>The spokesperson said: \u201cJon Boutcher, the head of Operation Kenova, and his team has prepared files containing evidence regarding a number of offences in the investigation\u2019s terms of reference \u2013 including murder, kidnap, torture, malfeasance in a public office and perverting the course of justice. Those files are now in the process of being made available to the Public Prosecution Service for consideration.</p> <p>\u201cIt would not be appropriate to go into further detail regarding that evidence, or the number of individuals involved, until that consideration has taken place. A full report of Operation Kenova\u2019s finding will be published at the conclusion of all legal proceedings.\u201d</p> <p>The general officer commanding the British army in Northern Ireland between 1983 and 1990, Gen Sir John Wilsey, has described Stakeknife as \u201cthe golden egg\u201d of military intelligence\u2019s agents during the Troubles. General Wilsey claimed Stakeknife saved \u201chundreds and hundreds of lives\u201d.</p> <p>Wilsey, who once secretly met Stakeknife in Belfast to reassure him he was not going to be outed as an agent, revealed in a book that one of his officers from the Devonshire and Dorset regiment originally recruited Scappaticci, a former IRA internee prisoner, as an agent in 1976.</p> <p>The soldier spy recruiter who was later seconded to the Force Research Unit was awarded the Queen\u2019s Gallantry medal partly for recruiting and running Stakeknife. The recruited agent would go on to leak high-grade information about senior IRA commanders, including the late Martin McGuinness, to army intelligence.</p> <p>From Margaret Thatcher onwards successive prime ministers as well as Northern Ireland secretaries received regular briefings based on the intelligence Stakeknife handed over to his military handlers. Much of this information was also filtered through MI5 and RUC Special Branch.</p> <p>The Guardian has learnt that Boutcher was given full access to all the cabinet papers related to Stakeknife intelligence that every prime minister was shown since the end of the 1970s. Boutcher was also able to read MI5, FRU and RUC files detailing the information Stakeknife was providing as well as his own role in the IRA\u2019s \u201cnutting squad\u201d.</p> <p>Boutcher\u2019s report and files to the PPS will also rekindle the row over so-called on-the-run or get-out-of-jail letters that Tony Blair\u2019s government gave to dozens of IRA fugitives and suspects during the peace process.</p> <p>The cards were given to IRA activists as part of a secret concession to Sinn F\u00e9in that a large number of republicans would not be pursued for past Troubles-related crimes. The scheme outraged unionists and a number of terrorist victims campaign groups.</p> <p>At least one man named in the Kenova files being handed over to the PPS in Belfast is an IRA suspect who has one of the on-the-run letters.</p> <p>One source close to the Kenova investigation said \u201cit makes no difference\u201d to Boutcher and the Kenova detectives if anyone he has named to the PPS has an on-the-run letter from the Blair government.</p> <p>The PPS in Northern Ireland now has to make the final decision whether to prosecute any of those named in Boutcher\u2019s report. This could lead to Britain\u2019s key spy within the IRA appearing in court and, the risk of him exposing his handlers and the way FRU ran covert intelligence operations during the Troubles.</p> <p>Sources close to the Kenova investigation said they now expect after a \u201chigh level of access and co-operation\u201d that the \u201choneymoon period is coming to an end\u201d between its detectives and the security forces as the political-military establishment seeks to protect some of its most senior officers who operated covertly in the undercover war during the conflict.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A police inquiry into one of the biggest spy scandals in the history of British intelligence has recommended that more than 20 people including senior security force personnel and ex-IRA members be considered for prosecution, the Guardian has learned. Operation Kenova, the multimillion-pound investigation into \u201cStakeknife\u201d \u2013 the army agent at the heart of the IRA during the Northern Ireland Troubles \u2013 has now sent files identifying military commanders and at least one IRA veteran with a so-called \u201cget-out-of-jail\u201d card to the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) in Belfast. Sources close to the inquiry have also revealed that its head, Jon Boutcher, the ex-chief constable of Bedfordshire, has had access to all secret briefing papers given to every prime minister from Margaret Thatcher onwards that related to the running of Stakeknife within the IRA. Stakeknife stands accused of overseeing the murder of alleged informers within the IRA while at the same time working as one of Britain\u2019s most important spies within the Irish republican movement. It is understood that the man accused of being Stakeknife, alleged to be Belfast bricklayer Freddie Scappaticci, is among those named by Boutcher. Sources said Scappaticci and the others on the files form \u201cpart of the evidence to be considered\u201d by the PPS. Scappaticci has always denied that he is Stakeknife ever since he was allegedly outed as a British agent in 2003. He is alleged to have been the IRA\u2019s chief spycatcher, the head of its internal security unit known within Irish republican circles as \u201cthe nutting squad\u201d or \u201cthe head-hunters\u201d. The unit was the most feared and supposedly secretive branch of the IRA during the conflict. The Stakeknife scandal centres on the allegation that while he was working for the British Army\u2019s intelligence branch, the Force Research Unit (FRU), the agent was allowed by his military handlers to commit crimes including torture and murder. It is alleged that Stakeknife is directly linked to 18 murders of IRA members accused of being informers and that the mole-hunting unit he headed was responsible for 30 deaths overall. A number of families of IRA members shot dead after being accused of treachery have made separate complaints to Northern Ireland\u2019s police ombudsman, claiming that Stakeknife\u2019s handlers in the security forces failed to use their agent to prevent the killings. A spokesperson for Operation Kenova and Boutcher confirmed that files have now been sent to the PPS in Belfast. The spokesperson based at the Bedfordshire constabulary declined to confirm or deny that Scappaticci and more than 20 others have been named as potential suspects for the PPS to charge. The spokesperson said: \u201cJon Boutcher, the head of Operation Kenova, and his team has prepared files containing evidence regarding a number of offences in the investigation\u2019s terms of reference \u2013 including murder, kidnap, torture, malfeasance in a public office and perverting the course of justice. Those files are now in the process of being made available to the Public Prosecution Service for consideration. \u201cIt would not be appropriate to go into further detail regarding that evidence, or the number of individuals involved, until that consideration has taken place. A full report of Operation Kenova\u2019s finding will be published at the conclusion of all legal proceedings.\u201d The general officer commanding the British army in Northern Ireland between 1983 and 1990, Gen Sir John Wilsey, has described Stakeknife as \u201cthe golden egg\u201d of military intelligence\u2019s agents during the Troubles. General Wilsey claimed Stakeknife saved \u201chundreds and hundreds of lives\u201d. Wilsey, who once secretly met Stakeknife in Belfast to reassure him he was not going to be outed as an agent, revealed in a book that one of his officers from the Devonshire and Dorset regiment originally recruited Scappaticci, a former IRA internee prisoner, as an agent in 1976. The soldier spy recruiter who was later seconded to the Force Research Unit was awarded the Queen\u2019s Gallantry medal partly for recruiting and running Stakeknife. The recruited agent would go on to leak high-grade information about senior IRA commanders, including the late Martin McGuinness, to army intelligence. From Margaret Thatcher onwards successive prime ministers as well as Northern Ireland secretaries received regular briefings based on the intelligence Stakeknife handed over to his military handlers. Much of this information was also filtered through MI5 and RUC Special Branch. The Guardian has learnt that Boutcher was given full access to all the cabinet papers related to Stakeknife intelligence that every prime minister was shown since the end of the 1970s. Boutcher was also able to read MI5, FRU and RUC files detailing the information Stakeknife was providing as well as his own role in the IRA\u2019s \u201cnutting squad\u201d. Boutcher\u2019s report and files to the PPS will also rekindle the row over so-called on-the-run or get-out-of-jail letters that Tony Blair\u2019s government gave to dozens of IRA fugitives and suspects during the peace process. The cards were given to IRA activists as part of a secret concession to Sinn F\u00e9in that a large number of republicans would not be pursued for past Troubles-related crimes. The scheme outraged unionists and a number of terrorist victims campaign groups. At least one man named in the Kenova files being handed over to the PPS in Belfast is an IRA suspect who has one of the on-the-run letters. One source close to the Kenova investigation said \u201cit makes no difference\u201d to Boutcher and the Kenova detectives if anyone he has named to the PPS has an on-the-run letter from the Blair government. The PPS in Northern Ireland now has to make the final decision whether to prosecute any of those named in Boutcher\u2019s report. This could lead to Britain\u2019s key spy within the IRA appearing in court and, the risk of him exposing his handlers and the way FRU ran covert intelligence operations during the Troubles. Sources close to the Kenova investigation said they now expect after a \u201chigh level of access and co-operation\u201d that the \u201choneymoon period is coming to an end\u201d between its detectives and the security forces as the political-military establishment seeks to protect some of its most senior officers who operated covertly in the undercover war during the conflict.",

      "bodyText": "Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r would not confirm whether or not Paul Pogba will return to the Manchester United squad for the Premier League game at Newcastle on Sunday, though he did admit that the chief reason he has stayed at home for the Europa League match on Thursday night is fears over AZ Alkmaar\u2019s synthetic surface. Strictly speaking the artificial pitch in question belongs to Den Haag \u2013 the game is at a borrowed venue because of storm damage at Alkmaar\u2019s own ground \u2013 but Solskj\u00e6r is something of an expert on artificial turf and confessed he would not have risked the player anyway. \u201cAfter discussions with the specialist we decided Paul\u2019s ankle injury would benefit from further treatment and rest, but I wouldn\u2019t have risked him on AstroTurf anyway,\u201d the United manager said. \u201cI\u2019m surprised AZ have chosen to play in this pitch, to be honest. Coming from Norway I\u2019m used to AstroTurf pitches and this is not one of the best I\u2019ve seen, it\u2019s actually one of the worst. The artificial surfaces we have in Norway are a lot more modern. \u201cI\u2019m not saying this one isn\u2019t safe, but it seems like it\u2019s been used a lot. I\u2019m surprised anyone would need AstroTurf in this sort of climate. It\u2019s OK when you live near the north pole, like we do, otherwise you would never get a full season, but I can\u2019t say I\u2019m a fan of artificial surfaces instead of grass.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r knows better than most how artificial surfaces can exacerbate old injuries and cause new problems \u2013 \u201cwith my knees I\u2019ve never really enjoyed it\u201d \u2013 but also feels the surface alters the nature of the game. \u201cI\u2019m not complaining or trying to get excuses in early, it\u2019s the same for both teams and we\u2019ll just get on with it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you have to play a different style of football on AstroTurf. You get a lot fewer tackles because players are reluctant to go to ground, and you find it is easier to pass because the ball tends to run true. We were always going to make a few changes for this match, it\u2019s not so much the pitch as the fact it is a week of three games, but the knowledge that the middle one is going to be played on AstroTurf has to be factored in as well.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r intends to field a blend of youth and experience, as he did in the first group match, when a much-altered side produced a somewhat laboured one-goal victory over Astana at Old Trafford, and insists at the moment he would be more than happy with a 1-0 win away from home.

He said: \u201cIt would also be bad for consumers as it would become more expensive to move goods into Northern Ireland.\u201d Northern Ireland\u2019s economy is highly connected with the Republic under the EU customs union regime, with a trade in goods relationship worth about \u00a35.2bn. About a third of goods and services exports are sold to the Republic, while about a quarter of its imports come from the Republic. Under Johnson\u2019s plan, the movement of goods would require customs checks, though he says they could be limited by alternative arrangements such as electronic paperwork and a \u201cvery small number\u201d of physical inspections at traders\u2019 premises.

      "bodyText": "Jean-Claude Juncker has voiced his concerns that the Stormont veto in Boris Johnson\u2019s plans for the Irish border could see arrangements designed to keep the peace collapse as early as the end of 2020. During a phone call with the prime minister, the European commission president highlighted the risk that the UK\u2019s plans could unravel within 15 months, and set the communities in Northern Ireland against each other. As part of its proposal to replace the Irish backstop, the British government suggests that Northern Ireland would leave the EU\u2019s customs territory along with the rest of the UK but stay in regulatory alignment to avoid checks directly on the border. The Northern Ireland assembly would need to give its consent to that special relationship with the EU\u2019s single market in a vote by the end December 2020 when the standstill transition period ends. Stormont would have a vote every four years to confirm the decision. If Stormont voted in 2020 against Northern Ireland staying in the EU\u2019s single market for goods, the default position would be an effective no-deal situation with both Brussels and London under a legal requirement to restore a hard border. Johnson\u2019s plans make allowance for a year\u2019s unravelling period during which both sides would try to rescue the situation but there are major concerns about the impact on relations in Northern Ireland in such circumstances. In his 20-minute phone call with Johnson, Juncker pointed to the dangers in the prime minister\u2019s approach citing the \u201cproblematic points that will need further work in the coming days, notably with regards to the governance of the backstop\u201d, according to a commission statement. \u201cThe delicate balance struck by the Good Friday agreement must be preserved.\u201d Juncker also pointed out the continued problems with the UK\u2019s plan for Northern Ireland to leave the EU\u2019s customs territory, which would involve checks and controls to be reimposed on the island of Ireland. The UK has said that such checks on goods can be carried out at traders\u2019 premises and \u201cdesignated points\u201d, including potentially government buildings. The British government is also insisting that the EU rewrites its own customs code to allow greater exemptions for small traders on the island of Ireland from having to fill out customs paperwork. Dublin has insisted that it will not agree to any deal that involves further such checks and controls on the island of Ireland, given the risk to peace and the economy. Brussels is concerned that changes to its laws will create an open door to smugglers. Juncker\u2019s response was, nevertheless, littered with positive comments in a sign that the EU does not want to be blamed for a failure to find agreement. The commission said Juncker had praised Johnson\u2019s \u201cdetermination\u201d and \u201cacknowledged the positive advances, notably with regards to the full regulatory alignment for all goods and the control of goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain\u201d. Downing Street had briefed before Johnson\u2019s address to the Conservative party conference in Manchester that Johnson would use his platform to make a \u201cfinal offer\u201d to Brussels, but the rhetoric appeared in the end far more conciliatory than billed. Johnson instead stressed the UK was making a fair proposal which would avoid extra checks on goods on or near the border and that the EU should \u201ccompromise in their turn\u201d. In a letter to Juncker published on Wednesday, Johnson described his proposals as the \u201cbroad landing zone\u201d. It is still hoped in Brussels, that Johnson will come to recognise that the EU cannot accept a proposal that creates a customs border on the island of Ireland due to the risks to the single market, the all-Ireland economy and peace in the region. Given the UK is proposing a four-year time limit on alignment between Northern Ireland and the EU standards, there is some hope the British government might move on customs too. The EU is open to a Northern Ireland-only backstop that would keep the province in the customs union and under swathes of single-market legislation. And while there are yet to be discussions on putting a time limit on such an arrangement, EU sources have suggested Dublin could be put under pressure to accept such a deal if it was clear that the Commons would accept it. The more likely outcome, however, was that there would not be a deal and that the UK would be seeking an extension to its membership beyond 31 October, EU sources suggested. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, said: \u201cThere is progress but, to be frank, a lot of work still needs to be done.\u201d \u201cThis cannot be his last plan,\u201d said one senior source close to the negotiations. \u201cIt is unworkable to dissociate customs from the regulatory regime.

So we\u2019ll be listening very carefully to see if there\u2019s scope to bring it back somewhere reasonable.\u201d Following a meeting with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, in Berlin, Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, said the EU\u2019s member states would \u201clook carefully at the proposals\u201d. Merkel reiterated the comments but added that it was important that the EU27 stuck together, in an indication that Dublin\u2019s reaction in the coming days will be key. \u201cWe trust in Michel Barnier, and we will discuss it further,\u201d she said. In his speech to the Tory conference, Johnson had described the issue of customs as technical. Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach, told reporters that his government remained concerned by the UK\u2019s plans. \u201cIt\u2019s much more than technical. It\u2019s deeply political, legal, and the technical aspects are a small part of that,\u201d he said. The DUP has offered its support for the UK proposals but Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s president, Mary Lou McDonald, said the proposals should be thrown out. \u201cThis is not a viable proposal from the British government,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is incumbent on the EU and the Irish government to make it absolutely clear that this proposal is absolutely out of the question,.\u201d",

It is worth going back to the April budget this year when the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, provided a nice little section titled \u201cStrengthening the economy\u201d in which he announced \u201cthe next stage in our economic plan to make Australia even stronger\u201d. \u201cEven stronger\u201d is an interesting phrasing given it suggested that the economy was actually strong. It wasn\u2019t. GDP growth was falling to its worst levels since 2001 and the second worst for 27 years, unemployment was rising and GDP per capita was actually going backwards. Then after 33 months of keeping the cash rate steady at 1.5% the Reserve Bank cut rates in June to 1.25%, to 1.0% in July and now another cut to 0.75%. This is not something you see happening when the economy is \u201cstrengthening\u201d. Not only are we at the lowest cash rate, it is the lowest in real terms as well \u2013 at 0.75% the rate is is 0.85% pts below inflation growth of 1.6%: It is not so much a case of the RBA putting the foot to the floor to get the economic engine revving, as it is putting its foot through the floor. The government has been purposefully asleep while this has happened. Consider that just after the budget the market was already anticipating a cut in interest rates. But back in April the market only thought the RBA might just cut to 1.25% and gave a slight chance of a cut to 1.0% happening some time next year. We are now not only past that, the market is now anticipating a further cut to 0.5% by early next year and a nearly 50% chance of another cut to 0.25%: While this has been happening the government has continued to suggest everything is going to plan.

I guess you could say there has been this turning point \u2013 the first six months of this year saw slightly stronger growth than the last six months of 2018. But even still, the growth from January to June this year was among the slowest we have experienced since the GFC \u2013 and GDP per capita was still falling: There isn\u2019t a great deal of evidence that things are improving. The latest building approval figures out this week showed that for the 17th month straight the number of approvals for private sector houses fell: The low interest rates might be seeing a bit of a spike in house prices, but they are not creating much real economic activity yet. The government will be desperately hoping the August retail trade figures out tomorrow show some sign of improvement, because if not the hope for a lift in household consumption in the September GDP figures will be quickly slipping away. And that is why the RBA has seen the need to cut even further \u2013 because it not only wants to get GDP growth improving, it also is desperate to see inflation and wages growth improve because that will see people spending again in the shops. The only way this can happen is if the level of spare capacity in the labour market falls. And that means a fall in both unemployment and underemployment. It is here we saw the biggest change in the RBA\u2019s outlook. As noted by the economist Jason Murphy, the governor\u2019s statement announcing the rate cut on Tuesday included a change in wording from September\u2019s line of saying the aim was to \u201cmake progress in reducing unemployment\u201d. On Tuesday the aim became \u201cto reach full employment\u201d. What is full employment? It is not when everyone has a job \u2013 it is when the unemployment rate is such that if it falls any lower inflation growth starts accelerating. The last time this happened was in 2007-08 at the end of the mining boom when the unemployment rate reached 4.2%: Given the current unemployment rate is 5.3% that suggests we have a long way to go \u2013 the equivalent of about 140,000 people currently unemployed getting a job.

The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, toured drought-affected Stanthorpe in Queensland on Wednesday, saying parts of the state were clearly suffering \u201cnatural disaster\u201d and criticising the government for failing to build a single dam since being elected in 2013. \u201cThey talked about dams more than a thousand times in the parliament, this government has spoken about dams [but] they haven\u2019t dug a hole yet anywhere in the entire country to build a dam,\u201d Albanese said. Following controversy over Joyce\u2019s role as special drought envoy, which Labor has criticised as a political appointment that has not delivered value for taxpayers, the former Nationals leader told Guardian Australia he agreed with Labor that the government needed to \u201cget cracking\u201d on dam construction. While the government is refusing to release the \u201cawful lot\u201d of reports Joyce claims he sent Morrison while in the role, Joyce said he had used his position to lobby for dam funding, telling Morrison that dams were desperately needed to help provide drought-stricken communities with economic stimulus. He warned that if Tamworth ran out of water, the government would be faced with a \u201ccrisis\u201d that could see voters punish the Coalition at the ballot box. \u201cIt\u2019s no good talking about the crisis when it arrives, it should have been dealt with years ago, but it must be dealt with now, and it will be political annihilation if we don\u2019t,\u201d Joyce said. \u201cI would say, oh, be careful \u2013 the electorate is febrile.\u201d He pointed to the New South Wales state election result that saw the Shooters and Fishers party win the seats of Barwon and Murray off the Nationals and secure a stronghold in the seat of Orange as a warning for what could face the Coalition if it did not act. \u201cAnd the thing that will placate people\u2019s fears is if they see that we are actually doing something, they will say, well they can\u2019t make it rain, but they are having a crack at it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to stop talking about dams, and start building them.\u201d Joyce said that he had reported to Morrison while envoy that he believed six new dams were needed to help drought affected communities, listing the Nathan dam at the top of the Dawson river, O\u2019Connor dam near Mackay, Mole river near Tenterfield, Dungowan dam near Tamworth, Dubbo and Walcha as proposed sites. He also said he hoped Labor\u2019s support for dam construction could pressure state governments into removing and streamlining regulations to make them happen. \u201cRather than be parochial, let\u2019s work together \u2013 nobody is going to lose any political skin over this if people see us working together.\u201d The water resources minister, David Littleproud, and the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, were also on a drought tour on Wednesday, visiting Inverell in northern NSW to hear directly from farmers. When asked about water infrastructure, Littleproud said the states had control over water resources, and called on them to act.",

It is that the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility \u2013 and the mandate for judges to consider the option of shared care \u2013 should be abolished, because the evidence shows it is putting children at risk.</p> <p>Shared parenting is the jewel in the fathers\u2019 rights movement\u2019s crown. After decades of aggressive lobbying on it, they got much of what they wanted from the Howard government in 2006. To remove the presumption of shared parental responsibility from the Family Law Act<em> </em>would not only undo gains made by the fathers\u2019 rights movement since the 1990s, but also those of the Coalition\u2019s own culture warriors.</p> <h2><strong>How did we get here?</strong></h2> <p>Until the mid-1990s, children\u2019s safety and wellbeing <em>was</em> central to custody decisions. Judges were cautious about ordering children into supervised contact with a father who had been abusive, noting the risk of psychological trauma, and would even refuse access if contact between the mother and the abusive father was likely to diminish her capacity to parent. Overall, the family law system was guided by research that evidenced the importance of stable relationships between children and their primary caregivers.</p> <p>But that cautious culture began to change when new research, now contested, highlighted the benefits of a sustained relationship with <em>both </em>parents, and linked negative outcomes to absent fathers. As law reform commissioner Prof Helen Rhoades wrote, fathers\u2019 rights groups used this research to lobby for laws mandating equal shared parenting, \u201carguing that failure to provide them with contact is child abuse\u201d.</p> <p>In 1995, after sustained lobbying from fathers\u2019 rights groups, this shift towards a \u201cpro-contact\u201d culture was written into the Act by the Keating government. The reformed Act stated that parents share responsibility for the care and welfare of their children, and children have a right to ongoing contact with both parents. This wasn\u2019t meant to apply carte blanche \u2013 it was to be balanced by the court\u2019s requirement to ensure children\u2019s safety from family violence.</p> <p>Over the following decade, however, multiple studies identified a terrible trend: the rights of children to be safe from violence were slipping beneath the principle of the \u201cright to ongoing contact\u201d.</p> <p>Despite clear evidence of this disturbing trend, another campaign by fathers\u2019 rights groups moved the Howard government to further amend the Act<em> </em>in 2006. The Shared Parental Responsibility Act introduced changes designed to make it easier for fathers to be granted access to or custody of their children. These included the new \u201cfriendly parent\u201d provision, which required parents to support their child\u2019s relationship with the other parent. \u201cUnfriendly\u201d parents \u2013 especially victims of domestic abuse \u2013 were routinely warned by their lawyers that presenting allegations of abuse would damage their case or risk them losing access to their children altogether.</p> <p>Across the family law system, the pro-contact culture was mutating. Denying contact between a father and his child was being identified as an unacceptable risk of harm \u2013 even greater than the risk of maintaining contact with a father who had abused his children. In Murphy v Murphy (2007) Justice Carmody wrote:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The consequences of denying contact between the abusive parent, usually the father, and the child, may well be as serious as the risk of harm from abuse. Thus, in D\u2019Agostino a father who was convicted of sexually interfering with his 11-year-old daughter was not denied contact either with her or her two younger sisters, but was allowed contact on condition that all three children were together at the same time and another adult was also present.</p> </blockquote> <p>This emphasis on pro-contact became, according to Rhoades, \u201cthe new orthodoxy\u201d in family law. Culturally, across the family law system, father absence was being constructed \u201cas a greater social problem than domestic violence\u201d. Statistics bear this out: despite allegations of family violence featuring in more than half of cases, only 3% of fathers are denied access to their children. Three per cent.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t just the courts that came to see mothers as the problem: a national survey from 2017 found 43% of Australians agree that mothers \u201coften make up or exaggerate claims of domestic abuse in order to improve their case\u201d. The \u201caccepted wisdom\u201d that false allegations were commonplace became a weapon for lawyers acting for alleged perpetrators. As soon as a mother (or child) alleged abuse, they could counter-allege \u201cparental alienation syndrome\u201d, a now discredited term that denotes children\u2019s abuse allegations and fears are commonly coached into them by vexatious or delusional mothers. The cure, according to the child psychiatrist who invented the concept, was to switch custody to the father, and suspend contact entirely with the mother for a period of weeks or months.</p> <p>The widely used concept of parental alienation (which, after being exposed as junk science, is still alluded to under synonyms like \u201cbrainwashing\u201d, \u201cprojection of anxieties\u201d and \u201cenmeshment\u201d) has led to some extreme outcomes in the family courts. One case I examined closely in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/24/its-like-you-go-to-abuse-school-how-domestic-violence-always-follows-the-same-script\">my book on domestic abuse</a> was that of Sandra*, who raised disclosures of sexual abuse made by her two young children.</p> <p>Despite her youngest, Sally*, repeating the disclosures to police, child protection services and a counsellor, and despite child protection finding that the father was a risk of sexual harm to one or both children, the family court judge in her case agreed with the family report writer\u2019s analysis that the allegations likely stemmed from the \u201canxiety of the mother\u201d.</p> <p>In a secret hearing, the judge ordered that custody be switched to the father, despite the kids having only ever had limited contact with him. Sandra was prohibited from seeing or even speaking to her children for two weeks. Following that, she could only see her children a couple of hours every fortnight, monitored by a supervisor at $65 an hour. Aside from her allegations, the family report writer found no other problems with Sandra\u2019s parenting.</p> <p>In the majority of cases featuring allegations of family violence or child abuse, however, orders weren\u2019t made for a switch in custody. The vast majority did, however, end up with orders for equal shared parental responsibility \u2013 up to 79%.</p> <h2>Allegations of family violence dismissed</h2> <p>So why wasn\u2019t the child\u2019s right to be safe overriding the presumption of shared parental responsibility? Because, according to criminologist Dr Samantha Jeffries, from the school of Criminology and Criminal Justice at Griffith University, allegations of family violence were simply being minimised or dismissed by the courts. In focus groups with lawyers and social workers, Jeffries was told time and again that this was because domestic violence does not fit into the pro-contact ideology of the court.</p> <p>\u201cParticipants said the parent-child relationship has to be maintained at all costs,\u201d she says. \u201cSo you need to make the domestic violence go. You need to invalidate it, otherwise, how can you possibly legitimise an ongoing relationship with a perpetrator of domestic violence?\u201d The quickest way to make the violence disappear, said Jeffries, was to discredit the mother. \u201cShe\u2019s dishonest, she\u2019s exaggerating, she\u2019s hysterical \u2013 she\u2019s the one with the issues.\u201d</p> <p>In the 2010 report No Way To Live<em>, </em>mothers described the reality of being court-ordered to co-parent with an abuser. Said one, \u201cIt\u2019s very distressing some of the things they come home and say. \u2018My daddy said he\u2019s going to run over you\u2019 or \u2018My daddy wants me to go to karate so I can bash you\u2019.\u201d </p> <p>In one case, the father had sexually abused the children during a court-ordered contact visit, and yet was still granted supervised access. The mother, forced to relocate to enable the supervised contact, was told by the court-appointed expert in her case that an ongoing relationship with their father was necessary for the children, because they \u201cneeded to have positive experiences to forget the rest\u201d.</p> <p>By 2011, it was clear that the family law system was not protecting children. This moved then attorney general Robert McClelland to fight for another set of changes to the Family Law Act. In 2012, McClelland\u2019s reforms removed Howard\u2019s \u201cfriendly parent\u201d provision, expanded the definition of domestic violence, and gave greater weight to the child\u2019s right to safety over the benefit of a relationship with both parents.</p> <p>But despite these changes, the family law system continued to prioritise the right to contact over the right to safety. As one evaluation showed, perpetrators of domestic violence were continuing to achieve \u201csignificant and substantial unsupervised time with their children\u201d. In cases involving allegations of family violence or child abuse, shared parental responsibility was still the result in up to 83% of cases (and 40% of cases that went before a judge).</p> <h2>Putting children at centre of law</h2> <p>The 2017 House of Representatives inquiry into family law, chaired by then Liberal MP (now Senator) Sarah Henderson, recommended that the Australian Law Reform Commission consider removing the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility from the Family Law Act, because it appeared to be \u201cleading to unjust outcomes and compromising the safety of children\u201d. It also recommended that allegations of family violence be determined earlier in legal proceedings, to deliver justice not only to those impacted by family violence, but also to those falsely accused.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/20/the-pms-family-court-inquiry-is-a-boneheaded-gift-to-pauline-hanson-and-mens-rights-activists\">The PM's family court inquiry is a boneheaded gift to Pauline Hanson and men's rights activists | Katharine Murphy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Following 179 consultations across Australia, and over 1,200 written submissions, the ALRC agreed that the presumption of \u201cequal shared parental responsibility\u201d should be replaced with \u201cjoint decision making about major long-term issues\u201d. It also recommended abolishing the section requiring the courts to consider equal, substantial or significant time with each parent.</p> <p>Viewed together, the two reports outline out a radical plan to put children\u2019s safety back at the heart of family law. This is urgent work. We need a revolution in the family law system that is both cultural and structural. It needs to change the court\u2019s position from pro-contact \u2013 an orthodoxy that has led to women and children being routinely disbelieved \u2013 to pro-children.</p> <p>This new inquiry is not about giving everyone a say. Few women will feel comfortable airing their most traumatic and humiliating stories before a politician who has already pre-judged them as liars. This is about boosting the grievances of a certain group of men \u2013 some dedicated fathers who have been wronged, and others excluded from their children\u2019s lives because they are dangerous. In an inquiry like this, there will be no way to tell the difference between the two.</p> <p>If this new inquiry further entrenches the dangerous pro-contact culture of the family law system, one thing is clear: it will make it an even more dangerous institution for children.</p> <p>*Names have been changed</p> <ul> <li><p>Jess Hill is the author of <a href=\"https://www.blackincbooks.com.au/books/see-what-you-made-me-do\">See What You Made Me Do: Power, Control and Domestic Abuse</a></p></li> </ul>",

It needs to change the court\u2019s position from pro-contact \u2013 an orthodoxy that has led to women and children being routinely disbelieved \u2013 to pro-children. This new inquiry is not about giving everyone a say. Few women will feel comfortable airing their most traumatic and humiliating stories before a politician who has already pre-judged them as liars. This is about boosting the grievances of a certain group of men \u2013 some dedicated fathers who have been wronged, and others excluded from their children\u2019s lives because they are dangerous. In an inquiry like this, there will be no way to tell the difference between the two. If this new inquiry further entrenches the dangerous pro-contact culture of the family law system, one thing is clear: it will make it an even more dangerous institution for children. *Names have been changed Jess Hill is the author of See What You Made Me Do: Power, Control and Domestic Abuse",

In a media interview on Wednesday, the prime minister accused the banks of profiteering by not passing on the full rate cut. \u201cThe banks are basically profiteering,\u201d Scott Morrison said. \u201cThe public will judge them but I am not buying it.\u201d</p> <p>Last Thursday, Frydenberg <a href=\"https://ministers.treasury.gov.au/ministers/josh-frydenberg-2018/speeches/address-afr-property-summit-hilton-sydney\">told a property forum</a> that \u201cthe shadow of the royal commission and recent litigation has given rise to uncertainty as to how [responsible lending rules] ought to be implemented in practice\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe values of personal responsibility and personal accountability must remain central to our society and if the pendulum swings too far in the abrogation of these values, then it will inevitably reduce the availability of credit and increase its price,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cShould responsible lending laws be applied too stringently, they will also negatively impact consumer behaviour with consumers more likely to remain with their current provider than go through the red tape burden associated with looking for alternatives.\u201d</p> <p>On Monday Frydenberg criticised one of the big four banks for allegedly denying a couple a loan because of their spending on an in-vitro fertilisation program, the <a href=\"https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/frydenberg-banks-asking-couples-about-ivf-is-highly-inappropriate/news-story/b6481e326a583dd279c6f584688a443a\">Daily Telegraph reported</a>.</p> <p>Speaking in New York the previous day, <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/morrison-tells-sheepish-banks-to-keep-lending-20190924-p52u8z\">Scott Morrison said</a> Australians should not be scared of \u201cthe animal spirits in our economy and the role of the banking and financial system in extending credit\u201d and urged banks to \u201clean in\u201d to the economy following the royal commission.</p> <p>The government\u2019s calls for banks to loosen the purse strings contrasts with new research from the investment bank UBS which found that so-called \u201cliar loans\u201d, where borrowers are not fully truthful in their applications for credit, have risen to a record 39% of the market.</p> <p>First signs that the government would be striking a new tone on responsible lending appeared last month during a parliamentary committee hearing where government backbenchers, led by Victorian senator James Paterson and NSW lower house MP Jason Falinski, spent more than an hour applying the blowtorch to Australian Securities and Investments Commission chiefs over the regulator\u2019s decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/10/asic-appeals-judges-wagyu-and-shiraz-westpac-ruling\">appeal its loss</a> in a responsible lending lawsuit against Westpac.</p> <p>The rightwing thinktank the Institute of Public Affairs, where Paterson formerly worked, has <a href=\"https://ipa.org.au/ipa-today/when-regulators-roam-out-of-control\">attacked Asic\u2019s conduct in the case</a>, as well as mounting a wider campaign against regulatory \u201cred tape\u201d in the financial sector and the broader economy.</p> <p>The lawsuit is popularly known as the \u201cshiraz and wagyu\u201d case because the federal court judge Nye Perram used the delicacies as examples of things borrowers could go without in order to afford their mortgage repayments, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/13/westpac-wins-legal-action-after-asic-accused-it-of-250000-irresponsible-lending-cases\">sparking outrage from consumer groups</a>.</p> <p>Regulators were stunned by the ferocity of the parliamentary questioning, and concerned that the attack could foreshadow additional moves to loosen the bonds of the scandal-prone finance sector.</p> <p>But within Asic some comfort has been drawn from the fact the onslaught happened in public, rather than behind closed doors or through discreet telephone calls.</p> <p>\u201cThat was the sound of the pendulum swinging back \u2013 hard,\u201d one well-placed regulatory source told Guardian Australia.</p> <p>Falinski declined to comment and referred inquiries to Paterson, who has

      "bodyText": "A heavy campaign of lobbying by Australia\u2019s banks preceded the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, telling financial regulators not to enforce responsible lending laws \u201ctoo stringently\u201d, Guardian Australia can reveal. Regulators have been left with whiplash by a sudden change in the tone of government remarks over the past month, from a generally tough-on-banks stance following the Hayne royal commission to a new emphasis on the \u201cpersonal responsibility\u201d of borrowers. The chief executive of the Australian Banking Association, Anna Bligh, said the peak body had lobbied widely on the issue. \u201cOf course I have spoken to government ministers, shadow ministers, other members of parliament and regulators about the application of responsible lending laws, a significant issue of critical importance to our economy being debated across the country, from the boardroom of the Reserve Bank to local backyard barbecues,\u201d she said. \u201cBanks have been on the record for many months on this issue and made no secret of their desire to ensure the right balance is struck between lending responsibly and ensuring the free flow of credit which is of critical importance to the economy.\u201d The government has previously talked about the importance of keeping credit flowing, but its rhetoric has become increasingly sharp in recent weeks, with any criticism of banks now focusing on decisions that tend to curb borrowing and spending. On Tuesday Frydenberg called on the banks to pass on all of a 25-basis point rate cut that the Reserve Bank governor, Philip Lowe, said was needed to counteract weak household spending and low wages growth \u2013 pressure defied by Australia\u2019s biggest bank, the Commonwealth. In a media interview on Wednesday, the prime minister accused the banks of profiteering by not passing on the full rate cut. \u201cThe banks are basically profiteering,\u201d Scott Morrison said. \u201cThe public will judge them but I am not buying it.\u201d Last Thursday, Frydenberg told a property forum that \u201cthe shadow of the royal commission and recent litigation has given rise to uncertainty as to how [responsible lending rules] ought to be implemented in practice\u201d. \u201cThe values of personal responsibility and personal accountability must remain central to our society and if the pendulum swings too far in the abrogation of these values, then it will inevitably reduce the availability of credit and increase its price,\u201d he said. \u201cShould responsible lending laws be applied too stringently, they will also negatively impact consumer behaviour with consumers more likely to remain with their current provider than go through the red tape burden associated with looking for alternatives.\u201d On Monday Frydenberg criticised one of the big four banks for allegedly denying a couple a loan because of their spending on an in-vitro fertilisation program, the Daily Telegraph reported. Speaking in New York the previous day, Scott Morrison said Australians should not be scared of \u201cthe animal spirits in our economy and the role of the banking and financial system in extending credit\u201d and urged banks to \u201clean in\u201d to the economy following the royal commission. The government\u2019s calls for banks to loosen the purse strings contrasts with new research from the investment bank UBS which found that so-called \u201cliar loans\u201d, where borrowers are not fully truthful in their applications for credit, have risen to a record 39% of the market. First signs that the government would be striking a new tone on responsible lending appeared last month during a parliamentary committee hearing where government backbenchers, led by Victorian senator James Paterson and NSW lower house MP Jason Falinski, spent more than an hour applying the blowtorch to Australian Securities and Investments Commission chiefs over the regulator\u2019s decision to appeal its loss in a responsible lending lawsuit against Westpac. The rightwing thinktank the Institute of Public Affairs, where Paterson formerly worked, has attacked Asic\u2019s conduct in the case, as well as mounting a wider campaign against regulatory \u201cred tape\u201d in the financial sector and the broader economy. The lawsuit is popularly known as the \u201cshiraz and wagyu\u201d case because the federal court judge Nye Perram used the delicacies as examples of things borrowers could go without in order to afford their mortgage repayments, sparking outrage from consumer groups. Regulators were stunned by the ferocity of the parliamentary questioning, and concerned that the attack could foreshadow additional moves to loosen the bonds of the scandal-prone finance sector. But within Asic some comfort has been drawn from the fact the onslaught happened in public, rather than behind closed doors or through discreet telephone calls. \u201cThat was the sound of the pendulum swinging back \u2013 hard,\u201d one well-placed regulatory source told Guardian Australia. Falinski declined to comment and referred inquiries to Paterson, who has been contacted but is travelling overseas. Sources with knowledge of the lobbying process said the banks were very active in Canberra in the week before the hearing. Two sources said Westpac had been the most aggressive in its lobbying efforts, but a source close to the bank said this was not correct. \u201cEveryone is saying Westpac in particular have been going a bit batshit crazy in Canberra and briefing anyone and everyone,\u201d one regulatory source said. Another senior regulatory source said other financial services businesses also lobbied hard. \u201cThe big banks just want to do what they want,\u201d the source said. The source said this was despite the banks cleaning up their loan application processes for their own commercial reasons. Asic\u2019s vigorous treatment by the government backbenchers at the committee hearing also reflected the long-held view within the Liberal party that the market should be set free, a government source said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a new government and they feel emboldened,\u201d the source said. The source said the stoush also probably indicated tension between Frydenberg\u2019s office and Asic. \u201cThese sort of things are rarely unsanctioned, to some degree,\u201d the source said. A spokeswoman for the treasurer declined to comment on whether he had spoken to Westpac or the Asic chairman, James Shipton, about the responsible lending issue. \u201cThe treasurer regularly speaks with regulators, financial institutions, and large and small businesses about a range of issues within his portfolio,\u201d she said. Asic declined to comment.",

He attributed his lost voice to \u201cgiving too many speeches lately\u201d and his campaign insisted the senator was not sick.</p> <p>If elected, Sanders would be the oldest president to serve. He is also the oldest candidate in the 19-person Democratic field, and is five years older than Donald Trump.</p> <p>Asked about his age, the Vermont senator has said he considers himself \u201cblessed\u201d with \u201cgood health\u201d and \u201cgood energy\u201d. He points to his athleticism, running long distance when he was younger.</p> <p>\u201cJudge a person on whether you like them, whether their ideas make sense, whether you think they can do the job,\u201d Sanders <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bernie-sanders-2020-running-for-president-announcement-full-transcript-today-2019-02-19/\">told CBS News </a>in his first interview after entering the race. \u201cI think that\u2019s how we should look at people running for office, not just on one criteria, about age.\u201d</p> <p>His aides have said age-related concerns amount to \u201cageism\u201d and dare critics to try to keep pace with the senator on the campaign trail. Sanders keeps a notoriously rigorous schedule, often packing multiple events in different cities into a single day.</p> <p>The age of the party\u2019s frontrunners \u2013 all of whom are in their 70s \u2013 has been a subtext of the campaign, and younger candidates have made the case for a new generation of leadership.</p> <p>The former vice-president Joe Biden\u2019s tendency to deliver sometimes discordant responses during speeches and debate performances has raised questions from other candidates and voters about his acuity. Biden is 76.</p> <p>The Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, 70, has received the least age-related scrutiny, perhaps due to her sharp delivery and frequent displays of agility. At campaign events, Warren typically jogs on to the stage, and a video of her sprinting through New York\u2019s Penn Station to catch a train went viral earlier this year.</p> <p>News of Sanders\u2019 procedure comes after his campaign announced one of the strongest fundraising totals of the quarter. Sanders raised $25m, the highest among any candidate who have reported their figures so far.</p> <p>The haul was a welcome reset after a long summer of losing ground to Warren, who has passed him as the progressive alternative to Biden. Sanders has dropped to third place in most national and state-level polls behind Biden and Warren and his campaign has started to reshuffle staff in an effort to reclaim his standing.</p> <p>Sanders\u2019 Democratic rivals were quick to respond to the news, wishing him a speedy recovery.</p> <p>\u201cAnyone who knows Bernie understands what a force he is,\u201d Biden wrote on Twitter. \u201cWe are confident that he will have a full and speedy recovery and look forward to seeing him on the trail soon.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1179417780556312576\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/DrBiden?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@DrBiden</a> and I are sending our best wishes to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BernieSanders?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@BernieSanders</a>, Jane, and the whole Sanders family.

The stents are threaded into place through blood vessels in the groin or wrist, requiring only a tiny incision. Most are coated with medication to prevent the targeted artery from re-closing. That is still a risk, requiring monitoring, and patients also often are prescribed blood thinners to prevent clots from forming in the stents.</p> <p>A letter released by his physician when he ran for president in 2016 showed that he was in \u201coverall very good health\u201d with elevated cholesterol but no history of cardiovascular disease. Sanders has said he will release his medical records before the primary begins next year.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 4 October 2019.

Sanders, 78, a Vermont senator and a leading contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, was hospitalized in Nevada on Tuesday night. \u201cDuring a campaign event yesterday evening, Senator Sanders experienced some chest discomfort,\u201d Sanders\u2019 senior adviser Jeff Weaver said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cFollowing medical evaluation and testing he was found to have a blockage in one artery and two stents were successfully inserted.\u201d Weaver added: \u201cSenator Sanders is conversing and in good spirits. He will be resting up over the next few days. We are canceling his events and appearances until further notice, and we will continue to provide appropriate updates.\u201d His wife, Jane O\u2019Meara Sanders, was on her way to Las Vegas on Wednesday morning, and according to the Associated Press, said her husband was \u201cdoing really well\u201d. Sanders was among 10 presidential candidates due to appear at a presidential forum on gun safety in Las Vegas on Wednesday. He will no longer attend. Later in the day, a tweet from Sanders\u2019 Twitter account thanked supporters, and plugged his trademark Medicare for All healthcare plan. \u201cThanks for all the well wishes. I\u2019m feeling good,\u201d the tweet read. \u201cI\u2019m fortunate to have good health care and great doctors and nurses helping me to recover. None of us know when a medical emergency might affect us. And no one should fear going bankrupt if it occurs. Medicare for All!\u201d Following a noticeably hoarse performance during the third televised presidential debate last month, Sanders canceled a handful of events in South Carolina to rest his voice. He attributed his lost voice to \u201cgiving too many speeches lately\u201d and his campaign insisted the senator was not sick. If elected, Sanders would be the oldest president to serve. He is also the oldest candidate in the 19-person Democratic field, and is five years older than Donald Trump. Asked about his age, the Vermont senator has said he considers himself \u201cblessed\u201d with \u201cgood health\u201d and \u201cgood energy\u201d. He points to his athleticism, running long distance when he was younger. \u201cJudge a person on whether you like them, whether their ideas make sense, whether you think they can do the job,\u201d Sanders told CBS News in his first interview after entering the race. \u201cI think that\u2019s how we should look at people running for office, not just on one criteria, about age.\u201d His aides have said age-related concerns amount to \u201cageism\u201d and dare critics to try to keep pace with the senator on the campaign trail. Sanders keeps a notoriously rigorous schedule, often packing multiple events in different cities into a single day. The age of the party\u2019s frontrunners \u2013 all of whom are in their 70s \u2013 has been a subtext of the campaign, and younger candidates have made the case for a new generation of leadership. The former vice-president Joe Biden\u2019s tendency to deliver sometimes discordant responses during speeches and debate performances has raised questions from other candidates and voters about his acuity. Biden is 76. The Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, 70, has received the least age-related scrutiny, perhaps due to her sharp delivery and frequent displays of agility. At campaign events, Warren typically jogs on to the stage, and a video of her sprinting through New York\u2019s Penn Station to catch a train went viral earlier this year. News of Sanders\u2019 procedure comes after his campaign announced one of the strongest fundraising totals of the quarter. Sanders raised $25m, the highest among any candidate who have reported their figures so far. The haul was a welcome reset after a long summer of losing ground to Warren, who has passed him as the progressive alternative to Biden. Sanders has dropped to third place in most national and state-level polls behind Biden and Warren and his campaign has started to reshuffle staff in an effort to reclaim his standing. Sanders\u2019 Democratic rivals were quick to respond to the news, wishing him a speedy recovery. \u201cAnyone who knows Bernie understands what a force he is,\u201d Biden wrote on Twitter. \u201cWe are confident that he will have a full and speedy recovery and look forward to seeing him on the trail soon.\u201d \u201cI hope to see my friend back on the trail very soon,\u201d Warren said. \u201cHe\u2019s a fighter,\u201d Harris added. \u201cI look forward to seeing him on the campaign trail soon.\u201d The procedure Sanders underwent can immediately improve symptoms such as chest pain or shortness of breath. The stents are threaded into place through blood vessels in the groin or wrist, requiring only a tiny incision. Most are coated with medication to prevent the targeted artery from re-closing. That is still a risk, requiring monitoring, and patients also often are prescribed blood thinners to prevent clots from forming in the stents. A letter released by his physician when he ran for president in 2016 showed that he was in \u201coverall very good health\u201d with elevated cholesterol but no history of cardiovascular disease. Sanders has said he will release his medical records before the primary begins next year. \u2022 This article was amended on 4 October 2019. An earlier version said that Sanders is three years older than Trump. The age gap is five years \u2013 Sanders is 78, Trump is 73.",

      "bodyText": "The mayoral candidate for the West Midlands, Salma Yaqoob, has offered an olive branch to shadow minister Naz Shah, admitting her decision to stand against her was \u201ca misjudgment\u201d and called for a truce. Labour\u2019s selection process to oppose Conservative incumbent Andy Street was plunged into acrimony after Shah, the shadow minister for women and equalities, accused Yaqoob of being unfit for office. Shah, the MP for Bradford West, is demanding that Yaqoob should not be allowed to stand as Labour\u2019s candidate to be West Midlands mayor. She accused the former Birmingham councillor of running a \u201cdespicable\u201d general election campaign against her in Bradford West two years ago. Yaqoob \u2013 who is backed by Momentum\u2019s leader, Jon Lansman \u2013 apologised to Shah and called for a \u201cconstructive resolution\u201d that would allow them both to move on. The row has been ignited after the party\u2019s national executive committee (NEC) gave Yaqoob permission to oppose the MP Liam Byrne and the unions\u2019 favourite, Pete Lowe, in the contest to stand for Labour in the mayoral race. Shah wrote to the NEC claiming Yaqoob endorsed a campaign of misogyny, patriarchy and clan politics in 2017. She also claimed she was driven to contemplate suicide after Yaqoob\u2019s campaign exploited patriarchal politics, or biradri, among the city\u2019s Kashmiri and Pakistani communities. Yaqoob denied running such a campaign but has now issued a statement calling for an end to the \u201cbitterness\u201d and said that bearing grudges against each other would not help the Labour party or wider movement. \u201cWhilst I accept my decision to stand was ill judged, it was not taken with any intention to cause harm \u2013 towards Naz Shah personally or the Labour party,\u201d she said. \u201cI did not run or endorse a campaign of misogyny, patriarchy and clan politics. Even as a political opponent I showed her respect as a woman and a public figure. \u201cAs shadow equalities and women minister, I would hope she would welcome the principle of women coming forward for political office \u2013 even those she disagrees with.

I am keen to work with all Labour colleagues, including Naz Shah, to fight the real battle with the Tories to achieve this.\u201d Yaqoob also expressed concern that Shah had contemplated suicide and called for the two women to work together inviting a process of mediation. She said: \u201cI am genuinely sorry to read that Naz Shah has felt suicidal.

Surface Earbuds Microsoft also announced a new set of true wireless earbuds, called the Surface Earbuds, which are direct competitors to Apple\u2019s AirPods and Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Buds and join its existing Surface Headphones. The Bluetooth earbuds feature one-clip pairing, multi-device compatibility \u2013 meaning they can be used with PCs, phones and tablets from all brands \u2013 and have up to 24-hour battery life with a charging case.

Duo is not without risk, but Microsoft isn\u2019t trying to repeat history and reinvent the wheel. It\u2019s using an established platform to deliver a new category that is optimised for a Microsoft experience. \u201cThis is the start of a journey for Microsoft and expectations should be set accordingly.\u201d",

It is an especially good thing that his matinee idol looks have faded enough to allow him to become the character actor he always wanted to be. I have no doubt that the best work of Hugh Grant\u2019s career hasn\u2019t even happened yet. But this is just violently preposterous. He\u2019s got a little beard.

Metropolitan police will be put on 12-hour shifts from Monday, the first day of Extinction Rebellion\u2019s action, to free up as many officers as possible from regular duties. Forces across England have already been asked to contribute specialist \u201cprotest removal teams\u201d trained and equipped to deal with protesters using locks and glue to hamper efforts their removal as they attempt to block key routes.

      "bodyText": "The power of photographer Simon Adams is to make you see the crystalline beauty of any given moment. A City crowd is moving in all directions, under two old-fashioned clocks in a panoramic black and white print that is radically focused so that while the background is all a blur, faces in the foreground are picked out in super-lucid detail. It\u2019s a freeze-frame of the quotidian wonder that we take for granted \u2013 but Adams doesn\u2019t. His pictures hold life with intense appreciation. In 2012, Adams was diagnosed with motor neurone disease. He is paralysed from the neck down, dependent on carers who, in addition to their medical responsibilities, help set up his digital camera to shoot his big, wide-eyed images of the city and nature. An owl stares at you with hypnotic predatory intent; a purple sky broils over an aquamarine sea \u2026 these are photographs full of awe and passion, celebratory works of art that make you see afresh. Adams happens to be my brother-in-law, but all this means is that I have some knowledge of the courage behind his impressive works. It doesn\u2019t change my judgement of their excellence \u2013 go see for yourself. All the artists in Art Beyond Limits, an exhibition to mark the 40th anniversary of the Motor Neurone Disease Association, either have this most devastating of illnesses or have been closely affected by it. Participants range from Sarah Ezekiel, who was diagnosed in 2000 and uses eye-gaze technology to make paintings, to recently retired Daily Mail cartoonist Mac, whose wife had MND. It adds unexpected tenderness to his cartoon of astronomers looking for Brexit when you discover it contains a hidden portrait of her. Like many people, I became aware of this illness, or group of illnesses, through the extraordinary achievements of Stephen Hawking. There is a picture of Hawking in this show with a caption that calls him \u201cour hero\u201d. His incredible life dramatised how MND separates mind and body in a way that poses a kind of philosophical problem. This can be a nightmare so severe that some sufferers just want to die, such as Richard Selley, who recently ended his own life at Dignitas after calling for an assisted dying bill.

      "body": "<h2><strong>Why did the prime minister present his Brexit plan in Manchester?</strong></h2> \n<p>Wrapping up his offer to the EU in a tub-thumping party conference speech is Boris Johnson\u2019s way of trying to avoid the grisly fate that befell Theresa May\u2019s Brexit proposals.</p> \n<p>Each time she announced a painstakingly drafted plan, it was rubbished on both sides of the Channel before she had a chance to sell it herself.</p> \n<p>Johnson instead announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/02/two-borders-four-years-what-boris-johnson-brexit-offer\">his</a> proposals to an enthusiastic crowd of supporters. And he also took the precaution of squaring off the Democratic Unionist party beforehand after a series of intensive behind-the-scenes negotiations. </p> \n<p>By mid-afternoon on Wednesday, it had become clear that the Spartans \u2013 the European Research Group MPs who helped to sink May\u2019s deal \u2013 were likely to follow the DUP\u2019s lead.</p> \n<p>The domestic reception really matters, because whatever they think of the details, there is little incentive for the EU27 to engage unless they believe Johnson could secure a majority in parliament, as May <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/29/what-now-for-brexit-after-theresa-may-deal-turned-down-for-third-time\">failed three times</a> to do.</p> \n<h2><strong>Is this all a charade? Does Johnson really want a deal?</strong></h2> \n<p>He does want a deal \u2013 as does his key aide Dominic Cummings, despite his reputation as a master of chaos. It is the cleanest route out of the bind the prime minister has found himself in, with the Benn act making a no-deal Brexit much more difficult and Labour refusing to support a general election.</p> \n<p>If he could get a deal through parliament by 19 October it would release him from the obligations of the Benn law and he could fight an election as the man who \u201cgot Brexit done\u201d against all the odds.</p> \n<p>But the Vote Leave crew who are driving the Brexit bus in Downing Street have long had clear red lines for a deal, albeit different ones from May.</p> \n<p>Johnson believes keeping the UK in the EU customs union indefinitely would prevent the UK from launching off into the buccaneering, free-trading future he likes to envisage. Ultimately, that was always going to have to mean customs checks of some kind, somewhere on the island of Ireland.</p> \n<p>In return, he (and crucially the DUP) has conceded that Northern Ireland will stick with EU rules on manufacturing and farm goods after the post-Brexit transition period, implying a border in the Irish Sea.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"73f497f7-48ef-4d47-95b2-af2d926d1a48\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Counties and customs</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Inside the EU, both Ireland and Northern Ireland are part of the single market and customs union so share the same regulations and standards, allowing a soft or invisible border between the two.<br></p>\n    <p>Britain\u2019s exit from the EU \u2013 taking Northern Ireland with it \u2013 risks a return to a hard or policed border. The only way to avoid this post-Brexit is for regulations on both sides to remain more or less the same in key areas including food, animal welfare, medicines and product safety.</p>\n    <p>The 'backstop' in Theresa May's Withdrawal Agreement was intended to address this - stating that if no future trade agreement could be reached between the EU and the UK, then rules and regulations would stay as they are. This has been rejected by Brexit supporters as a 'trap' to keep the UK in the EU's customs union, which would prevent the UK striking its own independent trade deals.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>There are an estimated 72m road vehicle crossings a year between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and about 14% of those crossings are consignments of goods, some of which may cross the border several times before they reach a consumer. Brexit supporters say this can be managed by doing checks on goods away from the border, but critics say it will be difficult to police this without any physical infrastructure like border posts or cameras, which could raise tensions in the divided communities of Ireland.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p><b>Interactive: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2019/sep/02/a-typical-hour-in-the-life-of-the-irish-border\">A typical hour in the life of the Irish border</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>What if the EU27 reject his plans?</strong></h2> \n<p>While the initial reaction from across the Channel was sceptical, as Downing Street had expected, Jean-Claude Juncker acknowledged that the UK had made concessions, and left the door open to continued talks.</p> \n<p>Bullish cabinet ministers have been telling anyone who will listen in Manchester that the EU27 will, in the end, \u201cblink\u201d but, as Johnson made clear in his letter to Juncker, time is very short.</p> \n<p>And while they hope for a deal, Johnson\u2019s team are also sanguine about a no-deal Brexit on 31 October and insist they will go full steam ahead if talks break down.</p> \n<h2><strong>But isn\u2019t the Benn law meant to prevent a no-deal Brexit?</strong></h2> \n<p>Yes, it requires the prime minister to write a letter to the EU27 requesting an extension if he has not won the approval of parliament for a deal or to leave without a deal by 19 October.</p> \n<p>Downing Street appears to believe it can bypass the legislation in some way \u2013 either by persuading EU leaders to close the door on an extension or in some way not implementing it in law.</p> \n<p>But the cross-party group of rebel MPs who drafted the legislation are convinced it is watertight \u2013 and deliberately picked a date they believe allows time to mount a legal challenge, right up to the supreme court if necessary, if Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/29/boris-johnson-fuels-speculation-could-ignore-brexit-delay-law\">tries to skirt it</a>.</p> \n<p>There would also be parliamentary efforts to force Johnson to comply.</p> \n<p>The nuclear option would be a vote of no confidence \u2013 but that would be extremely risky as, if Johnson loses, it opens up a 14-day window, spanning the critical 31 October date, during which he could try to reassemble a majority. Labour believes it could be difficult to dislodge him during that period.</p> \n<h2><strong>What if the courts ordered Johnson to delay Brexit?</strong></h2> \n<p>The PM has long said an extension would mean \u201cextinction\u201d for his party. But No 10 is feeling considerably less confident about winning court battles after the supreme court ruled the suspension of parliament was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/sep/24/boris-johnsons-suspension-of-parliament-unlawful-supreme-court-rules-prorogue\">unlawful</a> \u2013 so there has been a growing sense that a delay would be inevitable if a no-deal outcome was imminent.</p> \n<p>However, Johnson\u2019s colleagues now believe breaking his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/25/brexit-boris-johnson-britain-will-leave-eu-31-october-do-or-die\">\u201cdo or die\u201d pledge </a>to leave on 31 October would be less fatal than they feared because voters are increasingly seeing the PM as the man battling to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d in the face of resistance.</p> \n<p>They believe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/sep/24/say-it-with-a-brooch-how-a-fashion-item-became-a-political-statement\">Lady Hale and her spider brooch</a>, and the furore over Johnson\u2019s endless use of the phrase <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/26/pms-divisive-surrender-bill-phrase-neither-careless-nor-casual\">\u201csurrender bill</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/26/pms-divisive-surrender-bill-phrase-neither-careless-nor-casual\">\u201d</a>, only help to cement that impression in the public\u2019s mind.</p> \n<h2><strong>So if there</strong><strong> is no deal</strong><strong> are we head</strong><strong>ing for a \u2018</strong><strong>people v</strong><strong> parliament</strong><strong>\u2019 general election?</strong></h2> \n<p>Yes and no: Johnson would certainly fight that election on a platform of getting on with Brexit in the face of resistance from \u201cremoaners\u201d, those <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/commentisfree/2019/oct/01/tories-reveal-themselves-as-party-of-lawlessness-and-disorder\">Priti Patel called</a> the \u201cnorth London metropolitan liberal elite\u201d.</p> \n<p>He could either go full throttle with a no-deal platform, in the hope of neutralising the Brexit party, or hold out the prospect of a deal if the electorate gave him a fresh mandate (though that did not go well for May).</p> \n<p>But with the public sick and tired of hearing about Brexit, the Conservatives know they also need to talk about domestic policy. And they emerge from this party conference having staked out a clear patch of populist territory \u2013 anti-establishment, pro-public services, rightwing on crime.</p>",

Wrapping up his offer to the EU in a tub-thumping party conference speech is Boris Johnson\u2019s way of trying to avoid the grisly fate that befell Theresa May\u2019s Brexit proposals. Each time she announced a painstakingly drafted plan, it was rubbished on both sides of the Channel before she had a chance to sell it herself. Johnson instead announced his proposals to an enthusiastic crowd of supporters. And he also took the precaution of squaring off the Democratic Unionist party beforehand after a series of intensive behind-the-scenes negotiations. By mid-afternoon on Wednesday, it had become clear that the Spartans \u2013 the European Research Group MPs who helped to sink May\u2019s deal \u2013 were likely to follow the DUP\u2019s lead. The domestic reception really matters, because whatever they think of the details, there is little incentive for the EU27 to engage unless they believe Johnson could secure a majority in parliament, as May failed three times to do. Is this all a charade? Does Johnson really want a deal? He does want a deal \u2013 as does his key aide Dominic Cummings, despite his reputation as a master of chaos. It is the cleanest route out of the bind the prime minister has found himself in, with the Benn act making a no-deal Brexit much more difficult and Labour refusing to support a general election. If he could get a deal through parliament by 19 October it would release him from the obligations of the Benn law and he could fight an election as the man who \u201cgot Brexit done\u201d against all the odds. But the Vote Leave crew who are driving the Brexit bus in Downing Street have long had clear red lines for a deal, albeit different ones from May. Johnson believes keeping the UK in the EU customs union indefinitely would prevent the UK from launching off into the buccaneering, free-trading future he likes to envisage. Ultimately, that was always going to have to mean customs checks of some kind, somewhere on the island of Ireland. In return, he (and crucially the DUP) has conceded that Northern Ireland will stick with EU rules on manufacturing and farm goods after the post-Brexit transition period, implying a border in the Irish Sea. What if the EU27 reject his plans? While the initial reaction from across the Channel was sceptical, as Downing Street had expected, Jean-Claude Juncker acknowledged that the UK had made concessions, and left the door open to continued talks. Bullish cabinet ministers have been telling anyone who will listen in Manchester that the EU27 will, in the end, \u201cblink\u201d but, as Johnson made clear in his letter to Juncker, time is very short. And while they hope for a deal, Johnson\u2019s team are also sanguine about a no-deal Brexit on 31 October and insist they will go full steam ahead if talks break down. But isn\u2019t the Benn law meant to prevent a no-deal Brexit? Yes, it requires the prime minister to write a letter to the EU27 requesting an extension if he has not won the approval of parliament for a deal or to leave without a deal by 19 October. Downing Street appears to believe it can bypass the legislation in some way \u2013 either by persuading EU leaders to close the door on an extension or in some way not implementing it in law. But the cross-party group of rebel MPs who drafted the legislation are convinced it is watertight \u2013 and deliberately picked a date they believe allows time to mount a legal challenge, right up to the supreme court if necessary, if Johnson tries to skirt it. There would also be parliamentary efforts to force Johnson to comply. The nuclear option would be a vote of no confidence \u2013 but that would be extremely risky as, if Johnson loses, it opens up a 14-day window, spanning the critical 31 October date, during which he could try to reassemble a majority. Labour believes it could be difficult to dislodge him during that period. What if the courts ordered Johnson to delay Brexit? The PM has long said an extension would mean \u201cextinction\u201d for his party. But No 10 is feeling considerably less confident about winning court battles after the supreme court ruled the suspension of parliament was unlawful \u2013 so there has been a growing sense that a delay would be inevitable if a no-deal outcome was imminent. However, Johnson\u2019s colleagues now believe breaking his \u201cdo or die\u201d pledge to leave on 31 October would be less fatal than they feared because voters are increasingly seeing the PM as the man battling to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d in the face of resistance. They believe Lady Hale and her spider brooch, and the furore over Johnson\u2019s endless use of the phrase \u201csurrender bill\u201d, only help to cement that impression in the public\u2019s mind. So if there is no deal are we heading for a \u2018people v parliament\u2019 general election? Yes and no: Johnson would certainly fight that election on a platform of getting on with Brexit in the face of resistance from \u201cremoaners\u201d, those Priti Patel called the \u201cnorth London metropolitan liberal elite\u201d. He could either go full throttle with a no-deal platform, in the hope of neutralising the Brexit party, or hold out the prospect of a deal if the electorate gave him a fresh mandate (though that did not go well for May). But with the public sick and tired of hearing about Brexit, the Conservatives know they also need to talk about domestic policy. And they emerge from this party conference having staked out a clear patch of populist territory \u2013 anti-establishment, pro-public services, rightwing on crime.",

That was not enough to get him a job on the Liverpool Post and Echo, but it did win him a place on the ITN graduate trainee scheme in 1964.</p> <p>Starting as a bulletin subeditor, he became a general reporter in 1967, where his career and indeed his life was nearly cut short during the Nigerian civil war, when he was shot through both legs.

Following the chaotic launch of Channel 4 News in 1982 with its experimental range of presenters, he was employed to restore some order and led the evening bulletin five nights a week for the next seven years.</p> <p>In 1989 Sissons was poached by the BBC to present the Six O\u2019Clock News, being warned as he did so by David Nicholas, ITN\u2019s editor, that the corporation was only doing it to harm its rival.

Told in 2003 that the corporation was seeking younger presenters, he spent the final six years of his career presenting bulletins for BBC News 24.</p> <p>In later years, Sissons would become frustrated by the BBC\u2019s management and bureaucracy, and after his retirement railed against its editorial standards to sympathetic conservative newspapers.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s this belief that there\u2019s this magic lot of young people who will watch more avidly if you put younger presenters up front,\u201d he told the Sunday Times. \u201cNever believe you can\u2019t go out of fashion.\u201d</p> <p>In 2013 he wrote in the Sunday Telegraph. \u201cThe BBC today for all its high salaries is woefully short of great managerial and editorial talent, the sort of leadership you would follow over the top or into the jungle.\u201d He left the BBC in 2009 \u201cwithout a pang of regret\u201d, he told the Mail on Sunday.</p> <p>A lifelong supporter of Liverpool FC, Sissons was a member of the Hillsborough disaster independent panel: \u201cIt was the most worthwhile thing I have done because its work corrected such a mammoth injustice,\u201d he said. He also lectured on Saga cruise ship holidays and published his memoirs, When One Door Closes, in 2011.</p> <p>He married Sylvia Bennett, whom he had met at a Liverpool youth club, in 1965.

Peter was educated at Dovedale primary school, where the future Beatle John Lennon and comedian Jimmy Tarbuck were fellow pupils, and at the Liverpool Institute high school alongside Paul McCartney and George Harrison, leaving in 1961. He then went to University College Oxford, where he obtained a degree in philosophy, politics and economics and had his first journalistic experience, writing football reports for Cherwell, the student newspaper. That was not enough to get him a job on the Liverpool Post and Echo, but it did win him a place on the ITN graduate trainee scheme in 1964. Starting as a bulletin subeditor, he became a general reporter in 1967, where his career and indeed his life was nearly cut short during the Nigerian civil war, when he was shot through both legs. The wound shaved his femoral artery and left him in lasting pain thereafter. Returning to Britain, Sissons became ITN\u2019s industrial editor during the union militancy of the 1970s and, from 1978, a news presenter on ITN\u2019s News at One bulletin. Following the chaotic launch of Channel 4 News in 1982 with its experimental range of presenters, he was employed to restore some order and led the evening bulletin five nights a week for the next seven years. In 1989 Sissons was poached by the BBC to present the Six O\u2019Clock News, being warned as he did so by David Nicholas, ITN\u2019s editor, that the corporation was only doing it to harm its rival. The lure was that he would chair Question Time in succession to Robin Day, which he did for four years, a move that was not regarded as a success. But he also presided in turn over the Nine O\u2019Clock News then its transmogrification to Ten O\u2019Clock in 2000. Told in 2003 that the corporation was seeking younger presenters, he spent the final six years of his career presenting bulletins for BBC News 24. In later years, Sissons would become frustrated by the BBC\u2019s management and bureaucracy, and after his retirement railed against its editorial standards to sympathetic conservative newspapers. \u201cThere\u2019s this belief that there\u2019s this magic lot of young people who will watch more avidly if you put younger presenters up front,\u201d he told the Sunday Times. \u201cNever believe you can\u2019t go out of fashion.\u201d In 2013 he wrote in the Sunday Telegraph. \u201cThe BBC today for all its high salaries is woefully short of great managerial and editorial talent, the sort of leadership you would follow over the top or into the jungle.\u201d He left the BBC in 2009 \u201cwithout a pang of regret\u201d, he told the Mail on Sunday. A lifelong supporter of Liverpool FC, Sissons was a member of the Hillsborough disaster independent panel: \u201cIt was the most worthwhile thing I have done because its work corrected such a mammoth injustice,\u201d he said. He also lectured on Saga cruise ship holidays and published his memoirs, When One Door Closes, in 2011. He married Sylvia Bennett, whom he had met at a Liverpool youth club, in 1965. The couple had two sons, Jonathan and Michael, and a daughter, Kate. Sylvia and his children survive him. \u2022 Peter George Sissons, newscaster and TV presenter, born 17 July 1942; died 1 October 2019",

      "bodyText": "Driven by anger and grief, thousands of people came on to the streets of Hong Kong on Wednesday to denounce the shooting of a teenage student by police, an escalation of force that has intensified the standoff between protesters and authorities. In the daytime the protesters marched through the city centre, organised sit-ins at schools and gathered at a courtroom where other demonstrators faced rioting charges. In the evening thousands more joined largely peaceful rallies across Hong Kong, denouncing police brutality. Some called for the police force to be disbanded. Many at the demonstrations held their hands over the left side of their chests in tribute to 18-year-old Tsang Chi-kin, who was shot at point-blank range on Tuesday, with the bullet narrowly missing his heart. Tsang was in hospital in stable but critical condition after surgery to remove the bullet. The shooting shocked many in the city; despite copious use of teargas, water cannon, beanbags and other less lethal forms of violence over nearly four months of protests, officers had previously only fired their guns in warning. Tsang\u2019s injury and the wider chaos of Tuesday\u2019s protests, called to mark the 70th anniversary of communist rule in China as a \u201cday of grief\u201d, appeared to have further radicalised both demonstrators and their opponents. The city\u2019s largest police group called for a curfew, or for the government to bring in harsh colonial-era emergency powers, claiming its officers were working in \u201cwar-zone-like\u201d conditions, the South China Morning Post reported. Pro-Beijing politicians backed its demands and defended the police officer who opened fire, the Hong Kong Free Press reported. \u201cIt was a reasonable and legal action,\u201d said legislator Gary Chan. \u201cThe government should consider enacting an emergency law to stop the riots as soon as possible.\u201d Protesters in turn warned Hong Kong authorities that they would not back down. One declared: \u201cThis is war,\u201d at a press conference outside Tsang\u2019s school in the working-class Tsuen Wan district that brought together activist groups, protesters and the injured student\u2019s classmates. \u201cOn a day of celebration in Beijing, the people of Hong Kong were weeping from the teargas and bleeding from the bullets fired,\u201d said the protester, his face hidden behind a bandana and sunglasses. He asked to be described only as a \u201cHong Kong citizen\u201d. \u201cThe people of Hong Kong are sick and tired of having mere words of condemnation as their only shield against lethal bullets and rifles. Because by now it is beyond clear that this government does not even take its own people seriously.\u201d Others paid tribute to Tsang, who used the English name Tony, and called for international support while promising to forge a stronger resistance movement. The protests were originally sparked by anger at a now-withdrawn extradition bill, but have since expanded into a broader pro-democracy movement with five core demands including an inquiry into police violence. \u201cTony has always been a role model to junior classmates. He is also one of the best people I know,\u201d said a friend who gave his last name, Wong. \u201cThe anti-extradition movement gave him renewed purpose. Despite his tender age he never hesitated to stand up for the future of Hong Kong.\u201d Behind the speakers, school students in uniform gathered to chant protest slogans, including: \u201cLiberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times.\u201d They held banners attacking police brutality. Earlier, hundreds of students, alumni and staff gathered for a morning sit-in to support Tsang. He has been arrested for assault, but the school principal said he would be welcome to return to classes once he was released from hospital, defying calls from some pro-Beijing figures for him to be punished for his role in protests. Pictures from across Hong Kong showed students from other schools gathering in forecourts and on sports grounds, often with their hands over their hearts. In the city centre, protesters filed out of their offices around midday, and shut down a main road as they marched peacefully, singing the anthem Glory to Hong Kong. Some carried signs saying: \u201cYou can kill the dreamer but you can\u2019t kill the dream\u201d; while others held up their hands with fingers spread wide, a reference to the \u201cfive demands\u201d that have become the heart of the protest movement. Hundreds more gathered at a court in West Kowloon, where 96 people arrested at the weekend were expected to be charged with rioting. It was to be the largest mass hearing in the city since the handover from British colonial rule, according to the writer and activist Kong Tsung-gan. The lobby was crammed with relatives and supporters lining up for tickets, but the court had only 100 spaces. A mother of one young detainee said she had only seen him at a distance in hospital since he was arrested on Sunday, because he was receiving treatment for shoulder and arm injuries. Later, more than 2,000 people filled an open-air sports stadium in Tsuen Wan, many holding posters saying: \u201cDon\u2019t shoot our kids,\u201d and waving flashlights on their phones and singing a protest anthem. That gathering was peaceful, but on a march through nearby streets, protesters attacked businesses considered pro-China and barricaded roads. In other parts of the city, protesters threw molotov cocktails and flooded a metro station. In the shopping area of central Causeway Bay, protesters calling for the Hong Kong police to be disbanded began blocking roads, but dispersed before violence broke out. Video from the scene appeared to show people calling on others to go home. Tuesday\u2019s chaos was the worst violence in the city since the protest movement began. Police had refused organisers a permit to march, but tens of thousands of people defied the ruling. At least 104 people were injured, four of them seriously, and 269 people arrested, the youngest of them only 12. The chaotic scenes overshadowed a carefully choreographed military parade and evening gala meant to celebrate China\u2019s rise to global superpower status, and celebrate its strongman president, Xi Jinping.",

As the Foreign Office declared in 2014 that the Chinese regarded the Sino-British \u201cjoint declaration\u201d as void, our response should be even stronger.

      "bodyText": "Hong Kong is at the forefront of the worldwide conflict between democracy and authoritarianism. Among those standing up for democratic values on which our western civilisation depends are university students and schoolchildren. They, unlike their Chinese counterparts, know what happened in Tiananmen Square in 1989, and remember the event annually by candlelit vigil. The democracy protests in 2014, which I saw first-hand as my own students were involved, were entirely peaceful, orderly and restrained. The protests were dubbed the \u201cumbrella movement\u201d due to the use of umbrellas to protect against police aggression. The current protests are still, by and large, peaceful but beset by increased police brutality (Hong Kong protester shot with live round as violence escalates, 2 October). The fears of these young people are real, including that of extradition to China, attempts to introduce \u201cnational education\u201d in schools, the proposed national anthem law, and the kidnapping of five Hong Kong booksellers in 2015. Our democratic world stands by as an authoritarian juggernaut masses its troops across the border, leaving these students to shoulder our values. As the Foreign Office declared in 2014 that the Chinese regarded the Sino-British \u201cjoint declaration\u201d as void, our response should be even stronger. Instead we, along with other western powers, seem to be accepting Chinese aggression as the new normal. Hong Kong needs our support. Janet Nichol Littlehampton \u2022 I must be one of the few survivors who took part in the Tiananmen Square parade on 1 October 1949 (Vast parade marks rise to status of superpower, 2 October). Aged 17, I was among the hundreds dressed in shabby uniforms, some wearing homespun cloth shoes or straw sandals, armed with old Remington rifles. Now, China has become one of the most powerful nations in the world with a modern army equipped with sophisticated weapons. Never was a truer maxim from Napoleon: \u201cChina is a sleeping giant, for when she awakes she will move the world.\u201d Esther Cheo Ying Samson Author of Black Country to Red China \u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com \u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit gu.com/letters \u2022 Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers?

      "bodyText": "The Premier League has appointed the Guardian\u2019s David Pemsel as its new chief executive. Confirmation of the appointment came at a Premier League meeting on Wednesday morning. Bruce Buck, the chairman of Chelsea, who was tasked with recruiting an individual to administer the top tier of English football, said Pemsel had been hired because of his \u201cstraightforward style and personal integrity\u201d. \u201cAt the Guardian he has shown strong leadership through a period of change and transformation. Returning the group to profit is an impressive achievement and has demonstrated that he can develop and execute a transformational plan in an ever-changing business landscape,\u201d Buck said. Pemsel, 51, has been chief executive of Guardian Media Group, the owner of the Guardian and the Observer, since July 2015. Working with the editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, he helped to increase the company\u2019s digital revenues while cutting costs. The company\u2019s main Guardian News &amp; Media subsidiary in 2018-19 recorded its first operating profit in many years, following a run of heavy losses, and now makes the majority of its money from online activities. Pemsel will stay at the Guardian until taking up the Premier League job in early 2020. His appointment follows a lengthy search for a new Premier League chief executive following the departure of former boss Richard Scudamore at the end of 2018. He will have to confront a changing media world where the ability of traditional pay-TV providers such as Sky and BT to dominate the multibillion-pound market for sports rights is being challenged by deep-pocketed newcomers such as Amazon. He will also have to manage the delicate relationship between the top Premier League clubs and their smaller rivals and friction over how they share broadcasting revenue, amid renewed speculation about a potential breakaway competition. Pemsel said: \u201cI have enjoyed my eight years at Guardian Media Group and want to thank everyone for their support and friendship, but now is the perfect time for me to take on the next challenge.\u201d Viner said she would miss working with Pemsel. \u201cWe were appointed to our roles within a month of each other in 2015 and we\u2019ve worked closely together ever since on the organisation\u2019s strategy and direction.

      "bodyText": "No member of the British government, including the prime minister, would ever collude with Donald Trump to try to discredit the work of intelligence agencies uncovering Russian interference in the 2016 US election, the UK foreign secretary said. Dominic Raab told the Commons that \u201cany such collusion is entirely unacceptable, would never happen, and did not happen\u201d. The foreign secretary refused to say at prime minister\u2019s questions whether Boris Johnson, or his predecessor, Theresa May, had spoken to the US president about any request to cooperate with the inquiry he had ordered into how the US intelligence agencies handled claims that Russia colluded with the Trump presidential campaign in 2016. The collusion claim led to the lengthy report by Robert Mueller, which showed that Russia was attempting to swing the presidential election in favour of Trump but did not say whether there had been collusion between Russia and Trump. Raab was asked whether, as reported in the Times, Trump had personally contacted Johnson to ask him to cooperate with the US inquiry. The Labour MP Ben Bradshaw implied that the purpose of any Trump request might be \u201cto undermine or smear British intelligence services, as well as damage cooperation with their US colleagues\u201d. Raab, deputising for Johnson at prime minister\u2019s questions, said: \u201cNeither the prime minister or, as then, the foreign secretary, would collude in the way that he described. That is entirely unacceptable and would never happen and did not happen.\u201d It is noticeable that the British government has been less willing than either the Australian or Italian governments to give details of help given to Trump\u2019s inquiry into the role of the US intelligence services. It is not clear if this reluctance stems from a habitual British refusal to discuss the work of the intelligence services, or instead a coolness inside those services at what they may regard as Trump efforts to use intelligence agencies as a weapon of war in his battle with his domestic political opponent. The UK intelligence service, scarred by the attempted murder in Britain of the double agent Sergei Skripal, does not take the same benign approach to Russia under Vladimir Putin as does Trump. The US attorney general, William Barr, met UK intelligence agencies in the summer to discuss Britain potentially cooperating with Trump\u2019s administration in an inquiry examining the FBI\u2019s investigation into alleged collusion with Russia, according to sources. Barr met British intelligence officials in London on 29 July at a meeting attended by intelligence agencies from the Five Eyes group, made up of the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. He was accompanied by the US homeland security department\u2019s acting deputy secretary, David Pekoske. The meeting was formally about the risks and opportunities of new technologies but Barr also raised his inquiries into the FBI investigation. It has been reported that Barr is pressing a range of foreign powers to cooperate with his effort to piece together the origins of the FBI investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s links with Russia. Barr\u2019s critics claim he is seeking to discredit the FBI investigation by constructing a vast conspiracy theory suggesting foreign powers were working to secure the presidential election in 2016 for Hillary Clinton.",

She said Green galvanised the group after being shocked by details of an equal pay case involving French lender BNP Paribas, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/11/female-banker-wins-gender-bias-case-after-witchs-hat-left-on-desk\">which made headlines last month.</a></p> <p>Harding told the Guardian: \u201cFor those of us that have been lucky enough to get into very senior positions in the public and the private sector, it\u2019s so tempting to assume that this isn\u2019t happening anymore. And it was a real wakeup call to all of us, to go: \u2018Oh my goodness it really is\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Harding, who chairs NHS Improvement, which oversees NHS trusts, explained the campaign is not focused on the gender pay gap, which tends to highlight <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2019/apr/05/gender-pay-gap-what-did-we-learn-this-year\">a lack of women in top roles</a>. Instead, efforts will be focused on ending gender pay discrimination, where women are paid less than male colleagues in the same roles.</p> <p>The case that sparked the campaign centred around banker Stacey Macken, who won an employment tribunal case against her employer BNP Paribas in a rare public victory for equal pay.

      "bodyText": "More than 100 of the UK\u2019s most successful women have launched a campaign to end pay discrimination after being shocked by the details of a female banker\u2019s employment battle. The #MeTooPay campaign has brought together high-profile names across politics, arts and business, including former Royal Mail boss Moya Greene, GSK chief executive Emma Walmsley, and London School of Economics director Minouche Shafik. Former TalkTalk boss Lady Dido Harding is also among the signatories. She said Green galvanised the group after being shocked by details of an equal pay case involving French lender BNP Paribas, which made headlines last month. Harding told the Guardian: \u201cFor those of us that have been lucky enough to get into very senior positions in the public and the private sector, it\u2019s so tempting to assume that this isn\u2019t happening anymore. And it was a real wakeup call to all of us, to go: \u2018Oh my goodness it really is\u2019.\u201d Harding, who chairs NHS Improvement, which oversees NHS trusts, explained the campaign is not focused on the gender pay gap, which tends to highlight a lack of women in top roles. Instead, efforts will be focused on ending gender pay discrimination, where women are paid less than male colleagues in the same roles. The case that sparked the campaign centred around banker Stacey Macken, who won an employment tribunal case against her employer BNP Paribas in a rare public victory for equal pay. Macken claimed she was discriminated against because of her gender, after finding she was paid significantly less than a male co-worker with the same job title. Macken was recruited on an annual salary of \u00a3120,000, less than the \u00a3160,000 offered to a male colleague recruited into the same position months later. That colleague took home \u00a3237,000 in bonuses over the next five years, which was seven times more than the combined \u00a333,000 offered to Macken. The #MeTooPay efforts launched on Wednesday with an advert in the Financial Times that read: \u201cWe wish to say to Stacey Macken and all other professional women whose compensation is tainted by discrimination, we are on your side.\u201d Pay discrepancy concerns were also renewed this week after a report found signs of resentment from professionals who have dismissed gender diversity as a matter of political correctness. Helena Morrissey, head of personal investing at Legal &amp; General Investment Management, said the pay gap data was \u201cboth depressing and galvanising\u201d. Harding personally recalls being castigated by one of her previous employers after asking for a pay rise. \u201cI felt most angry because I found out through ad-hoc gossip that I was paid less than my male colleagues.\u201d Harding admits she may not have dealt with the information properly but said her bosses were also ill-equipped to handle the issue. She said: \u201cThe feedback I had was \u2018how dare you\u2019 and I don\u2019t think my all-male bosses knew how to handle a woman asking for it either. Both sides were lacking in the skills to have that conversation.\u201d According to Harding, bosses are often blinded by unconscious bias and may end up giving a pay rise to men who feel confident enough to ask for one, while failing to raise pay for a talented young woman in the same role who hopes to be recognised for her work alone. \u201cWe have to compensate for that,\u201d Harding said, but added that women also need to be trained to negotiate. Harding, Greene and fellow campaigners have launched a website to serve as a \u201chub for action,\u201d where supporters can stay up to date on the latest stories around pay discrimination, hear about key court cases and get advice from compensation and negotiation experts. The campaign comes two years after the #MeToo movement started to raise the profile of sexual harassment and discrimination against women. Stacey Macken told the Guardian: \u201cI am grateful for the growing network of strong women who are not afraid to speak out and support other women [through] #MeTooPay.\u201d",

Will the transcripts inevitably leak out with the help of more whistleblowers? And could their combined effect be enough to persuade Senate Republicans it is time to dump Trump, just as an incriminating tape led to the downfall of President Richard Nixon?</p> <p>\u201cI think the conversations between Trump and world leaders stored in the White House server are critical, and could very well seal his fate,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.chriswhipple.net/\">Chris Whipple,</a> author The Gatekeepers: How the White House Chiefs of Staff Define Every Presidency.</p> <p>\u201cA single conversation, recorded in black and white by a notetaker, has already been a game-changer. Trump\u2019s mafia-style shakedown of the president of Ukraine has moved the needle dramatically. If there are other, similarly damning conversations to be found in the White House server, impeachment could gain critical mass in a hurry. And even this Senate might convict when confronted with that kind of evidence: Facts are stubborn things.\u201d</p> <p>Whipple added: \u201cThe House must move quickly to preserve the notes of those conversations.\u201d</p> <p>Unlike Nixon, or indeed any other US president in history, Trump had no prior political or military experience. His shallow knowledge, short attention span and tendency to wing it have been brutally exposed on the world stage. The public comments at a joint press conference with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, siding with the Russian president against his own intelligence agencies, were bad enough.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"901955f25fd25c5398e9b3b5d9144d6e3edea912\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/901955f25fd25c5398e9b3b5d9144d6e3edea912/0_0_2517_1902/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump shakes hands with Putin after his conversation at the summit in Helsinki in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"756\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump shakes hands with Putin after their conversation at the summit in Helsinki in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jussi Nukari/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But what he has said <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/us/politics/trump-calls-world-leaders.html\">on the line from the Oval Office,</a> White House residence or Air Force One, with officials typically producing a rough transcript straight away, may be worse.</p> <p>According to CNN, the president\u2019s phone calls with Putin and the Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman so alarmed White House officials that <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/27/politics/white-house-restricted-trump-calls-putin-saudi/index.html\">aides took</a> \u201cremarkable steps to keep from becoming public\u201d. This included <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/27/us/politics/nsc-ukraine-call.html\">storing reconstructed transcripts</a> of the calls on \u201ca highly classified computer system\u201d normally intended for closely guarded government secrets.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/trump-told-russian-officials-in-2017-he-wasnt-concerned-about-moscows-interference-in-us-election/2019/09/27/b20a8bc8-e159-11e9-b199-f638bf2c340f_story.html\">Last week the Washington Post reported</a> that in 2017, Trump told Russian officials in the Oval Office that he was \u201cunconcerned about Moscow\u2019s interference in the 2016 US presidential election because the United States did the same in other countries, an assertion that prompted alarmed White House officials to limit access to the remarks to an unusually small number of people.\u201d</p> <p>Then there was the Ukraine call with its request for an investigation into former vice president Joe Biden, a potential opponent in next year\u2019s presidential election. White House officials moved the summary of it to a \u201cstandalone computer system reserved for codeword-level intelligence information, such as covert action,\u201d according to an intelligence community whistleblower\u2019s complaint.</p> <p>A note in the complaint\u2019s appendix said: \u201cAccording to White House officials I spoke with, this was \u2018not the first time\u2019 under this administration that a Presidential transcript was placed into this codeword-level system solely for the purpose of protecting politically sensitive \u2013 rather than national security sensitive \u2013 information.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, the transcripts appeared to have been concealed to avoid embarrassment rather than security reasons. Democrats pursuing impeachment would give much to get their hands on this material, not least the content of the president\u2019s dialogues with Putin, to whom his continued deference remains <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/31/trump-russia-putin-dictators-populists-us-foreign-policy\">one of the great mysteries of the age.</a></p> <p>Adam Schiff, the chair of the House intelligence committee, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-september-29-2019-n1060096\">told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on Sunday:</a> \u201cIf those conversations with Putin or with other world leaders are sequestered in that same electronic file that is meant for covert action, not meant for this, if there\u2019s an effort to hide those and cover those up, yes, we\u2019re determined to find out.\u201d</p> <p>But whereas the White House was quick to release a rough transcript of the Ukraine conversation, implying a failure to comprehend its gravity, it is unlikely to be so forthcoming next time. Putin has already warned against it and independent observers warn that such disclosures would set a dangerous precedent, given foreign leaders\u2019 expectations of confidentiality.</p> <p>Yet secrets find a way, and the political momentum could become irresistible. Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow in the governance studies programme at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington, <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/events/impeachment-what-happens-now/\">told an audience there on Monday:</a> \u201cIt is very interesting how this issue may begin with Ukraine but end with Russia or Saudi Arabia or another country because it has now come out that there are hidden communications.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/28/donald-trump-richard-nixon-impeachment-robert-reich\">Trump can do more damage than Nixon. His impeachment is imperative | Robert Reich</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt reminds me of the revelation of the White House taping system during Watergate. Again, it was a throwaway: to was something that nobody ever even knew about, nobody knew it was going to happen. Once it was out there everybody said, \u2018Oh, my god! This can do it.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The West Wing tapes included the \u201csmoking gun\u201d evidence that Nixon told aides to order<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1974/08/06/archives/nixon-ordered-that-the-fbi-be-told-dont-go-any-further-into-this.html\"> the CIA to shut down the FBI\u2019s investigation</a> into a break-in at the Democratic National Committee offices at the Watergate complex. It confirmed testimony by John Dean, the former White House counsel, that Nixon tried to cover up the burglary. The president\u2019s once seemingly invincible support among Republicans collapsed and he was forced to resign before he could be impeached.</p> <p>While Nixon\u2019s offence was purely domestic, Trump directly solicited the intervention of a foreign power, an act that history may judge to be more heinous. While Nixon\u2019s fate was sealed by big and clunky tapes, the key to Trump\u2019s downfall may be locked in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/01/us/politics/white-house-classified-computer-system.html\">a hi-tech computer server.</a></p> <p>Kamarck added: \u201cNow, I would assume that at some point in this process a subgroup of Democrats and Republicans with the properly high security clearances are going to have a look at that server and they\u2019re going to have to say, \u2018What\u2019s in here? Is it all covert operations and military movements, or is it something else?\u2019</p> <p>\u201cWhat makes you suspicious is that server began to be used the day after the famous meeting between Trump and the Russian foreign minister and the Russian ambassador, where they threw out the Americans and let the Russians stay. So there\u2019s just a lot more to happen here.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "What did the president say and when did he say it? Donald Trump\u2019s politically catastrophic phone call with the leader of Ukraine, sufficient to prompt an impeachment inquiry, might just be the tip of an iceberg that could doom his presidency. On Monday it emerged that Trump urged Australia\u2019s prime minister during a recent phone call to help the US attorney general gather information that he hopes will undermine Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into alleged collusion with Russia. The White House restricted access to the call\u2019s transcript to a small group of presidential aides, the New York Times reported, noting this was an unusual decision similar to the handling of the July call in which he pressed Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy to dig for dirt on a political rival. It raised questions: how many more compromising conversations have there been? Will the transcripts inevitably leak out with the help of more whistleblowers? And could their combined effect be enough to persuade Senate Republicans it is time to dump Trump, just as an incriminating tape led to the downfall of President Richard Nixon? \u201cI think the conversations between Trump and world leaders stored in the White House server are critical, and could very well seal his fate,\u201d said Chris Whipple, author The Gatekeepers: How the White House Chiefs of Staff Define Every Presidency. \u201cA single conversation, recorded in black and white by a notetaker, has already been a game-changer. Trump\u2019s mafia-style shakedown of the president of Ukraine has moved the needle dramatically. If there are other, similarly damning conversations to be found in the White House server, impeachment could gain critical mass in a hurry. And even this Senate might convict when confronted with that kind of evidence: Facts are stubborn things.\u201d Whipple added: \u201cThe House must move quickly to preserve the notes of those conversations.\u201d Unlike Nixon, or indeed any other US president in history, Trump had no prior political or military experience. His shallow knowledge, short attention span and tendency to wing it have been brutally exposed on the world stage. The public comments at a joint press conference with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, siding with the Russian president against his own intelligence agencies, were bad enough. But what he has said on the line from the Oval Office, White House residence or Air Force One, with officials typically producing a rough transcript straight away, may be worse. According to CNN, the president\u2019s phone calls with Putin and the Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman so alarmed White House officials that aides took \u201cremarkable steps to keep from becoming public\u201d. This included storing reconstructed transcripts of the calls on \u201ca highly classified computer system\u201d normally intended for closely guarded government secrets. Last week the Washington Post reported that in 2017, Trump told Russian officials in the Oval Office that he was \u201cunconcerned about Moscow\u2019s interference in the 2016 US presidential election because the United States did the same in other countries, an assertion that prompted alarmed White House officials to limit access to the remarks to an unusually small number of people.\u201d Then there was the Ukraine call with its request for an investigation into former vice president Joe Biden, a potential opponent in next year\u2019s presidential election. White House officials moved the summary of it to a \u201cstandalone computer system reserved for codeword-level intelligence information, such as covert action,\u201d according to an intelligence community whistleblower\u2019s complaint. A note in the complaint\u2019s appendix said: \u201cAccording to White House officials I spoke with, this was \u2018not the first time\u2019 under this administration that a Presidential transcript was placed into this codeword-level system solely for the purpose of protecting politically sensitive \u2013 rather than national security sensitive \u2013 information.\u201d Indeed, the transcripts appeared to have been concealed to avoid embarrassment rather than security reasons. Democrats pursuing impeachment would give much to get their hands on this material, not least the content of the president\u2019s dialogues with Putin, to whom his continued deference remains one of the great mysteries of the age. Adam Schiff, the chair of the House intelligence committee, told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on Sunday: \u201cIf those conversations with Putin or with other world leaders are sequestered in that same electronic file that is meant for covert action, not meant for this, if there\u2019s an effort to hide those and cover those up, yes, we\u2019re determined to find out.\u201d But whereas the White House was quick to release a rough transcript of the Ukraine conversation, implying a failure to comprehend its gravity, it is unlikely to be so forthcoming next time. Putin has already warned against it and independent observers warn that such disclosures would set a dangerous precedent, given foreign leaders\u2019 expectations of confidentiality. Yet secrets find a way, and the political momentum could become irresistible. Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow in the governance studies programme at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington, told an audience there on Monday: \u201cIt is very interesting how this issue may begin with Ukraine but end with Russia or Saudi Arabia or another country because it has now come out that there are hidden communications. \u201cIt reminds me of the revelation of the White House taping system during Watergate. Again, it was a throwaway: to was something that nobody ever even knew about, nobody knew it was going to happen. Once it was out there everybody said, \u2018Oh, my god! This can do it.\u2019\u201d The West Wing tapes included the \u201csmoking gun\u201d evidence that Nixon told aides to order the CIA to shut down the FBI\u2019s investigation into a break-in at the Democratic National Committee offices at the Watergate complex. It confirmed testimony by John Dean, the former White House counsel, that Nixon tried to cover up the burglary. The president\u2019s once seemingly invincible support among Republicans collapsed and he was forced to resign before he could be impeached. While Nixon\u2019s offence was purely domestic, Trump directly solicited the intervention of a foreign power, an act that history may judge to be more heinous. While Nixon\u2019s fate was sealed by big and clunky tapes, the key to Trump\u2019s downfall may be locked in a hi-tech computer server. Kamarck added: \u201cNow, I would assume that at some point in this process a subgroup of Democrats and Republicans with the properly high security clearances are going to have a look at that server and they\u2019re going to have to say, \u2018What\u2019s in here? Is it all covert operations and military movements, or is it something else?\u2019 \u201cWhat makes you suspicious is that server began to be used the day after the famous meeting between Trump and the Russian foreign minister and the Russian ambassador, where they threw out the Americans and let the Russians stay. So there\u2019s just a lot more to happen here.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Nearly 100 Sikh police officers and veterans have called on law enforcement associations to create formal policies to allow officers to wear articles of faith. The appeal, in the form of a letter, came in the wake of the murder of a Sikh-American sheriff\u2019s deputy near Houston, Texas. Sandeep Singh Dhaliwal, a Harris county sheriff\u2019s deputy, was ambushed, shot and killed during a seemingly routine traffic stop last week. He was one of the first Sikh American police officers in the country to wear a turban and long beard, both traditional signs of faith for Sikhs. His funeral is Wednesday, the same day the letter went out. Dhaliwal was a \u201ctrailblazer\u201d, said Amrith Kaur, legal director of the Sikh Coalition, which helped organize the letter. Dhaliwal \u201chad such a legacy for wanting to serve the people of Harris county, and wanting to do that while also wanting to practice his faith\u201d, he added. Dhaliwal was 42 years old and worked for the sheriff\u2019s department for 10 years. He sold a business and changed careers to join the department, and was promoted from a detention officer in 2015. Dhaliwal was a father of three children. Police arrested a suspect in Dhaliwal\u2019s murder last week. Robert Solis, 47, was charged with capital murder. Police have not released a motive for the murder. In recent years, some wings of the military and police departments in major cities have moved to provide explicit policies for religious minorities to display articles of faith. For Sikhs, the most visible articles are a turban and uncut hair. Observant Sikhs also wear a small wooden comb, cotton undershorts, a steel bracelet and a small knife called a Kirpan. In spite of recent accommodations, the Sikh Coalition said only 25 of the nation\u2019s 15,400 police departments have specific policies on articles of faith. The US Air Force first allowed a Sikh man to wear a turban this year. There are 500,000 Sikhs in the United States, and 25 million worldwide. Service is considered an essential tenet of the Sikh religion. \u201cWe believe that no Sikh should have to face the impossible decision of choosing between their faith and public service,\u201d the letter said. \u201cDeputy Dhaliwal\u2019s service has shown that Sikhs have proven their mettle and desire to serve on the front lines of law enforcement while maintaining their religious articles of faith \u2013 and have done so with distinction and the respect of their communities. We hope that with the legacy of Deputy Dhaliwal in mind, we honor his sacrifice to our nation by ensuring that more Sikhs are permitted to serve in law enforcement with their religious articles of faith intact.\u201d The letter was sent to governing bodies of police organizations, such as the International Association of Chiefs of Police and the National Sheriff\u2019s Association.",

The monarch\u2019s family was Muslim and had resisted his state\u2019s incorporation into Hindu-dominated India.

Pakistan claimed the money was payment for weapons that would have been used to defend Hyderabad against the Indian army. The family of Nizam VII maintained that the cash had merely been lodged abroad for safekeeping. The case first arrived in the chancery division of the high court in London as long ago as 1954 when the Hyderabad royals challenged the bank and the Pakistan commissioner for the return of the money. With its echoes of the Jarndyce v Jarndyce saga in Charles Dickens\u2019 Bleak House, the claim reached the House of Lords in 1957 where Pakistan successfully asserted sovereign immunity. Legal proceedings were then effectively frozen for the next 60 years. In 2013, Pakistan decided to waive its right to sovereign immunity and launched legal action to claim the cash from NatWest. Their action triggered rival claims by the two grandsons of Nizam VII.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign and the Republican National Committee raised $125m in the third quarter of 2019, his campaign announced, an amount it credited, at least in part, to the looming threat of impeachment. In total the re-election effort has raised $308m so far this year, Trump\u2019s campaign said, and has over $156m in the bank. The haul comfortably outmatches Trump\u2019s Democratic rivals, some of whom released their own fundraising totals on Tuesday. However, Trump\u2019s good news comes against a backdrop of growing support for impeachment. On Wednesday a new poll showed that 46% of voters believe Congress should begin impeachment proceedings, versus 43% who are opposed. Still, the fundraising numbers will be a welcome boost for a beleaguered president. \u201cPresident Trump has built a juggernaut of a campaign, raising record amounts of money at a record pace,\u201d said Brad Parscale, Trump\u2019s campaign manager. In the same week that the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, announced the impeachment inquiry, Parscale said the campaign had received \u201c50,000\u201d new donations over two days. Parscale said the new donors showed that Trump\u2019s supporters \u201care showing up big league\u201d. Announcing the figures, Parscale credited the RNC chair, Ronna McDaniel, for her efforts. \u201cWith our great partnership with the RNC and Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, we will re-elect the president and win back the House of Representatives.\u201d Trump and the RNC\u2019s year-so-far total of $308m is more than double the amount Barack Obama had raised at the same point in 2011 \u2013 when he was running for a second term. Obama raised about $70m in the third quarter of 2011. McDaniel credited Democratic attacks on Trump for motivating supporters to donate in record numbers. \u201cWe are investing millions on the airwaves and on the ground to hold House Democrats accountable, highlight their obstruction, and take back the House and re-elect President Trump in 2020,\u201d she said. The haul outmatches Trump\u2019s Democratic rivals, some of whom released their own fundraising totals on Tuesday. Bernie Sanders, who is taking a break from campaigning following heart surgery, brought in $25.3m in the third quarter, and Pete Buttigieg raised $19.1m. Sanders also announced that his campaign would begin running a TV advert in Iowa. Further down the chain, Kamala Harris raised $11.6m, while Cory Booker \u2013 who had said he would quit the race if he failed to raise $1.7m in September \u2013 brought in $6m over the three-month period. Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren, who are leading the polls, are yet to release their figures. Campaigns have to share their fundraising totals by 15 October. Sanders said he had received 1.4m donations in the third quarter, at an average of $18 per donation. Buttigieg\u2019s $19.1m haul is down from the $24.9m he raised in the second quarter, when he led the field in fundraising. While the threat of impeachment might be buoying Trump supporters, recent polls have shown less positive signs for the president.

Just as the serifs that characterised classical Roman lettering had their origins in letters carved with a chisel in marble, the New Alphabet was Crouwel\u2019s response to the crude early days of digital dot matrix computer printing. The only way of making consistent letters out of dots was to create a typeface that used just straight lines. It produced a radical-looking new type that seemed like a natural reflection of a country that has no illusions about its artificial landscape of greenhouses and canals.</p> <p>Wim (Willem) was born in the provincial Netherlands city of Groningen, the son of Jacobus Crouwel, a printer, and his wife, Aganeta Wallerstein, who was in domestic service. He grew up there during the second world war, while his father endured two years of forced labour in Germany.</p> <p>Initially, Wim studied painting at the local art school, but was impressed enough by a poster made by <a href=\"https://www.cassandre-france.com/\" title=\"\">the designer AM Cassandre</a> advertising the <a href=\"https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O74368/etoile-du-nord-poster-cassandre/\" title=\"\">\u00c9toile du Nord express train</a> hanging on the studio wall to consider design as a career. He moved to Amsterdam in pursuit of a more sophisticated education at the <a href=\"https://rietveldacademie.nl/\" title=\"\">Gerrit Rietveld Academie</a>.</p> <p>There was a provocative point of view among postwar typographers that if only the Germans had not been so fond of capital letters they would have been able to resist the rise of nazism more effectively.

Crouwel shared Aicher\u2019s conviction that there was something faintly immoral about upper-case letters, but he was equally passionate in his belief that <a href=\"https://confessionsofadesigngeek.wordpress.com/2011/04/16/about-and-about-wim-crowel-in-conversation/\" title=\"\">the shape of the letters we use to make words has a deep impact on the way that we see the world</a>.</p> <p>He succeeded in designing what is likely to have been the world\u2019s only telephone directory without a single capital letter, for the Dutch post office, produced annually in the mid-1970s. In the analogue era, when every owner of a landline had a telephone book, they were printed in their millions and updated every year. Crouwel saved whole forests by using smaller type, reducing entries to the minimum and organising each page in three columns.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2a8cf6f30fb6f8f0749b123c314f44b74087c79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2a8cf6f30fb6f8f0749b123c314f44b74087c79/0_82_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wim Crouwel\u2019s work at the Design Museum, London, in 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wim Crouwel\u2019s work at the Design Museum, London, in 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luke Hayes</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What was perhaps most surprising about this apparently austere figure was his cult status among a generation of young graphic designers in Britain. Peter Saville used the New Alphabet for <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/designfacts/4412382924\" title=\"\">Joy Division\u2019s album cover in 1988</a> and for the first time the font became widely available. The appetite for hardcore modernist typography the album triggered was akin to the sudden enthusiasm for brutalist architecture.</p> <p>There is a striking mismatch between Crouwel the man and Crouwel the designer. The work suggests a puritan. But, in person, Crouwel had more than a touch of the dandy about him, an impression fostered by a <a href=\"https://www.wallpaper.com/design/wim-crouwel-obituary-2019#pic_1\" title=\"\">remarkable portrait</a> taken by his friend the fashion photographer <a href=\"https://www.foam.org/talent/foam-paul-huf-award\" title=\"\">Paul Huf</a> in 1969. He wears white shoes and a white suit. The trousers have no turn-ups. The tunic jacket has a fly front with a silver buckle fastening his collar. Even when he was not dressing like a Starfleet commander, he had a weakness for sharp tailoring and large-scale bow ties.</p> <p>When he stepped down as director of the Boijmans Van Beuningen, he was invited to curate a farewell exhibition. He chose 1928 as his subject, the year of his birth, and selected the tubular-steel cantilever chair that <a href=\"https://www.1stdibs.co.uk/furniture/seating/chairs/bauhaus-tubular-steel-cantilever-cesca-chair-marcel-breuer-gavina-knoll/id-f_9643151/\" title=\"\">Marcel Breuer</a> designed then, work by Le Corbusier and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/nov/08/guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">Charlotte Perriand</a>, and the <a href=\"https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/AM14/Amelia-Island/lots/r155-1928-bugatti-type-37a-grand-prix/181841\" title=\"\">Type 37</a><a href=\"https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/AM14/Amelia-Island/lots/r155-1928-bugatti-type-37a-grand-prix/181841\" title=\"\">A Bugatti</a>. In his eyes these were all things that made it a key year for the evolution of the modern world, and the design that shaped it. He was responsible for quite a bit of that himself.</p> <p>Crouwel met Emy Wijt, a ceramicist, in 1948, when they were students. They married four years later, and had two sons, Mels and Remco. The marriage ended in divorce. In 1963 he married his second wife, Judith Cahen, an art historian and curator, and they had a daughter, Gili. <a href=\"https://benthemcrouwel.com/\" title=\"\">Mels Crouwel</a>, an architect, designed <a href=\"https://www.wallpaper.com/architecture/stedelijk-museum-designed-by-benthem-crouwel-architects-amsterdam\" title=\"\">the 2012 extension to the Stedelijk Museum</a>.</p> <p>Crouwel is survived by Judith and his children.</p> <p>\u2022 Wim (Willem) Hendrik Crouwel, typographer, born 21 November 1928; died 19 September 2019</p>",

Crouwel saved whole forests by using smaller type, reducing entries to the minimum and organising each page in three columns. What was perhaps most surprising about this apparently austere figure was his cult status among a generation of young graphic designers in Britain. Peter Saville used the New Alphabet for Joy Division\u2019s album cover in 1988 and for the first time the font became widely available. The appetite for hardcore modernist typography the album triggered was akin to the sudden enthusiasm for brutalist architecture. There is a striking mismatch between Crouwel the man and Crouwel the designer. The work suggests a puritan. But, in person, Crouwel had more than a touch of the dandy about him, an impression fostered by a remarkable portrait taken by his friend the fashion photographer Paul Huf in 1969. He wears white shoes and a white suit. The trousers have no turn-ups. The tunic jacket has a fly front with a silver buckle fastening his collar. Even when he was not dressing like a Starfleet commander, he had a weakness for sharp tailoring and large-scale bow ties. When he stepped down as director of the Boijmans Van Beuningen, he was invited to curate a farewell exhibition. He chose 1928 as his subject, the year of his birth, and selected the tubular-steel cantilever chair that Marcel Breuer designed then, work by Le Corbusier and Charlotte Perriand, and the Type 37A Bugatti. In his eyes these were all things that made it a key year for the evolution of the modern world, and the design that shaped it. He was responsible for quite a bit of that himself. Crouwel met Emy Wijt, a ceramicist, in 1948, when they were students. They married four years later, and had two sons, Mels and Remco. The marriage ended in divorce. In 1963 he married his second wife, Judith Cahen, an art historian and curator, and they had a daughter, Gili. Mels Crouwel, an architect, designed the 2012 extension to the Stedelijk Museum. Crouwel is survived by Judith and his children. \u2022 Wim (Willem) Hendrik Crouwel, typographer, born 21 November 1928; died 19 September 2019",

For Grafton, place is more important than personality, and making good buildings a higher priority than theory, rhetoric or appearing in magazines. If Farrell and McNamara don\u2019t fit the usual celebrity architect mould, their buildings also feel of another era. They are interested in weight, mass, and the play of light on hefty volumes of concrete and stone. They sculpt spaces from great mineral slabs and soaring buttresses, carving out volumes in a manner reminiscent of heroic brutalist buildings of the postwar era. Their structures sometimes have an archaic, primitive quality, providing robust armatures for any number of different uses that might occur within their walls over the coming centuries that they look designed to endure. In a world of lightweight frames and clip-on cladding systems, this is solid architecture that is built to last. Grafton\u2019s medal win follows the award of the inaugural RIBA international prize in 2016 for the \u201cbest new building in the world\u201d, which went to their jaw-dropping building for the Universidad de Ingenier\u00eda y Tecnolog\u00eda (UTEC) in Lima, Peru. Standing above a motorway like a chunk of a stadium, the muscular concrete structure provides laboratories and classrooms in a vertiginous stack of terraces, connected by open walkways and meandering social spaces, feeling like a true extension of the city, cleft from the hillside. \u201cWe like to create spaces you couldn\u2019t design consciously, things that just happen somehow,\u201d McNamara told me at the time. \u201cRather than thinking of a space and then finding a structure for it, we make a structure and that, in turn, makes a space.\u201d They say they are interested in \u201cthe spaces in between, which haven\u2019t been asked for in the brief\u201d and describe their architecture as a kind of \u201cscaffolding\u201d, a non-prescriptive framework on which lives and events can be played out. Selected to curate the Venice Biennale in 2018, they set the theme as \u201cFreespace\u201d, which they described as \u201ca generosity of spirit and a sense of humanity at the core of architecture\u2019s agenda\u201d. They spoke of the \u201cfree and additional spatial gifts\u201d that architecture can offer \u2013 a core idea of their own buildings, which often feature generous, open, free-form spaces to be occupied as people see fit. Steps, benches, terraces and broad landings loom large. Current projects in the works for universities, including the London School of Economics, Kingston University and Toulouse, are all conceived as open, inviting forums. It is fitting that much of their work is for educational institutions given their own devotion to teaching. They taught at University College Dublin (UCD) from 1976 to 2002 and have been visiting professors at Lausanne, Harvard and Yale, currently holding professorships in Mendrisio, Switzerland. I first encountered McNamara in my final exam when I was a student, and she was the external examiner. After my lengthy spiel about the political and social forces at play in my project, she studied my drawings closely and gently informed me that I didn\u2019t really have a clue about the character of the interior spaces I was proposing. She was dead right. Farrell and McNamara founded their practice as a cooperative in 1978, having studied together at UCD in the early 1970s, and they are always keen to emphasise the collaborative nature of their work, naming fellow directors Gerard Carty and Philippe O\u2019Sullivan, who have been with the practice since 1992. But it is important for the RIBA gold medal that it has gone to a women-led firm. Until now, Hadid was the only woman to have won the prize in her own right since it was established in 1848. A vocal campaign, led by action group Part W, has been highlighting the many female architects who warrant the accolade \u2013 from social housing pioneer Kate Macintosh, to the Matrix Feminist Design Co-operative \u2013 and this year\u2019s choice marks a small step towards redressing the balance. May many more be recognised.",

In one sense, this is classic Pochettino. He likes to cite problems so they might be overcome, with everybody being drawn together in the process. Last season, for example, he made great play of the unwanted Wembley tenancy and the lack of new signings. This time, though, his targets have been more internal \u2013 in other words, the players \u2013 and it has consequently been riskier; potentially more divisive.</p> \n<p>Perhaps, after all that he has done for the club, Pochettino feels untouchable, able to speak his mind without the fear of reprisals from Daniel Levy, the chairman. But make no mistake, the pair have clashed over Pochettino\u2019s utterances, which have included the line from the manager about being ready to walk away had the team won the Champions League final.</p> \n<p>Pochettino can look like a shameless manoeuvrer but for now, the urgency is to fire an upturn in form. The team have won just nine times in their last 28 matches in all competitions. The mission resumes at Brighton on Saturday.</p>",

Serge Aurier is on record as saying he had \u201cdecided to leave\u201d only for it not to happen. Danny Rose was left out of the tour to Asia so he could find a new club. Nothing materialised. Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen are in the final years of their contracts and the question is not so much if these players retain the motivation to perform at their highest levels but whether Pochettino continues to trust them 100%. In the end, Pochettino is paid to manage the squad and, at times, it has felt as though he has poured fuel on to the fire with his honesty about the difficulty of various situations. In one sense, this is classic Pochettino. He likes to cite problems so they might be overcome, with everybody being drawn together in the process. Last season, for example, he made great play of the unwanted Wembley tenancy and the lack of new signings. This time, though, his targets have been more internal \u2013 in other words, the players \u2013 and it has consequently been riskier; potentially more divisive. Perhaps, after all that he has done for the club, Pochettino feels untouchable, able to speak his mind without the fear of reprisals from Daniel Levy, the chairman. But make no mistake, the pair have clashed over Pochettino\u2019s utterances, which have included the line from the manager about being ready to walk away had the team won the Champions League final. Pochettino can look like a shameless manoeuvrer but for now, the urgency is to fire an upturn in form. The team have won just nine times in their last 28 matches in all competitions. The mission resumes at Brighton on Saturday.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>THIS WEEK, ON SPURS \u2026</strong></h2> <p>In the era of the fly-on-the-wall football documentary, losing is the new winning. Sunderland\u2019s slide towards League One and Nasty Leeds\u2019 Spygate-tinged season were big on drama. Manchester City\u2019s chronicle of a near-perfect season proved less so, with star turn, tactical cyborg Pep Guardiola, being reinvented as the kind of character you might spot in one of those vox pops at a provincial shopping centre. And now Tottenham are set to become the latest team to star in their own documentary, an all-access deal reportedly agreed with Amazon Prime. Last year, Spurs didn\u2019t get their new stadium open until April, still got to Big Cup final, and promptly lost it within 23 seconds. With the cameras rolling behind the scenes this season, how could they possibly out-Spurs themselves? Fear not \u2026</p> <p>Spurs have been thrashed 2-2 by Manchester City, and let two-goal leads slip at Arsenal and Olympiakos. They\u2019ve lost at home to a Newcastle team led by Bernard Cribbins, a manager whose idea of a punishment is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/30/steve-bruce-newcastle-leicester\">giving his players the day off</a>. Failing to win trophies has been a stable of previous editions, but going out of the Milk Cup to Colchester United \u2013 a team that new overseas audiences might suspect are fictional \u2013 was a nice twist. Then there\u2019s Tuesday night\u2019s jaw-dropping Big Cup Special, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/01/tottenham-hotspur-bayern-munich-champions-league-match-report\">as Spurs were eviscerated by Bayern Munich</a>, the most destructive guests at a new home since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/05/mother-review-jennifer-lawrence-horror-darren-aronofsky-javier-bardem\">Mother!</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/01/serge-gnabry-robert-lewandowski-spurs-bayern-munich\">Irresistible Gnabry shreds Spurs after Lewandowski\u2019s decisive incision | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This truly was a double bill to savour, with Spurs getting thrashed twice in one game, their stadium emptied by two 10-minute bursts of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/01/serge-gnabry-robert-lewandowski-spurs-bayern-munich\">vintage Bavarian ruthlessness</a>. Serge Gnabry played the ice-veined villain, banging in four goals before tweeting \u201cNorth London is RED\u201d. The winger wasn\u2019t rated by Tony Pulis at West Brom and let go by Arsenal for \u00a35m, a crumb of comfort only visible under a microscope. Admittedly, Bayern had 10 shots on target to Tottenham\u2019s eight, the implausible 7-2 scoreline fuelled by laser-guided finishing that had Hugo Lloris checking the dimensions of the goal behind him. But don\u2019t let the facts get in the way of a riveting night\u2019s viewing.</p> <p>All of which leaves us wondering, again: what on earth happens next? Will Serge Aurier ever recover from his mid-game existential crisis? Could leading man Pochie, played with groin-grabbing intensity by Mauricio Pochettino, be hastily written out because his planet needs him? Or will they limp out of their group and end up lifting (then dropping, and irreparably damaging) Big Cup? Are these Spurs really the Spursiest Spurs who ever Spursed?

      "bodyText": "THIS WEEK, ON SPURS \u2026 In the era of the fly-on-the-wall football documentary, losing is the new winning. Sunderland\u2019s slide towards League One and Nasty Leeds\u2019 Spygate-tinged season were big on drama. Manchester City\u2019s chronicle of a near-perfect season proved less so, with star turn, tactical cyborg Pep Guardiola, being reinvented as the kind of character you might spot in one of those vox pops at a provincial shopping centre. And now Tottenham are set to become the latest team to star in their own documentary, an all-access deal reportedly agreed with Amazon Prime. Last year, Spurs didn\u2019t get their new stadium open until April, still got to Big Cup final, and promptly lost it within 23 seconds. With the cameras rolling behind the scenes this season, how could they possibly out-Spurs themselves? Fear not \u2026 Spurs have been thrashed 2-2 by Manchester City, and let two-goal leads slip at Arsenal and Olympiakos. They\u2019ve lost at home to a Newcastle team led by Bernard Cribbins, a manager whose idea of a punishment is giving his players the day off. Failing to win trophies has been a stable of previous editions, but going out of the Milk Cup to Colchester United \u2013 a team that new overseas audiences might suspect are fictional \u2013 was a nice twist. Then there\u2019s Tuesday night\u2019s jaw-dropping Big Cup Special, as Spurs were eviscerated by Bayern Munich, the most destructive guests at a new home since Mother!. This truly was a double bill to savour, with Spurs getting thrashed twice in one game, their stadium emptied by two 10-minute bursts of vintage Bavarian ruthlessness. Serge Gnabry played the ice-veined villain, banging in four goals before tweeting \u201cNorth London is RED\u201d. The winger wasn\u2019t rated by Tony Pulis at West Brom and let go by Arsenal for \u00a35m, a crumb of comfort only visible under a microscope. Admittedly, Bayern had 10 shots on target to Tottenham\u2019s eight, the implausible 7-2 scoreline fuelled by laser-guided finishing that had Hugo Lloris checking the dimensions of the goal behind him. But don\u2019t let the facts get in the way of a riveting night\u2019s viewing. All of which leaves us wondering, again: what on earth happens next? Will Serge Aurier ever recover from his mid-game existential crisis? Could leading man Pochie, played with groin-grabbing intensity by Mauricio Pochettino, be hastily written out because his planet needs him? Or will they limp out of their group and end up lifting (then dropping, and irreparably damaging) Big Cup? Are these Spurs really the Spursiest Spurs who ever Spursed? Find out next time, on Spurs. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Rob Smyth from 8pm BST for hot MBM coverage of Liverpool 2-1 RB Salzburg, while Ben Fisher will be on hand for Lille 2-3 Frank Lampard\u2019s Chelsea. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cI gambled everything and it hasn\u2019t paid off. I left a wonderful club, a wonderful group of people that were really on their way up. I gambled with other people\u2019s lives as well, my staff\u2019s lives, my wife\u2019s life. That is the thing for me that is really hurting because I worked so hard to get to a certain position and it just hasn\u2019t worked out.

Manchester City\u2019s Bernardo Silva is facing a potential ban after being charged with misconduct by FA bods over that tweet. Cardiff City will appeal to CAS over Fifa\u2019s ruling that they must pay Nantes the transfer fee for Emiliano Sala. \u201cThere remains clear evidence that the transfer agreement was never completed in accordance with multiple contractual requirements which were requested by Nantes, thereby rendering it null and void,\u201d insist Cardiff.

Paul Pogba will miss Manchester United\u2019s Big Vase trip to AZ Alkmaar due to foot-knack he sustained against Southampton back in August.

The fireplaces are stacked with smouldering turf, filling the air with a comforting, country cottage scent, and the little bar is the perfect place to hide yourself away for a while. Order a platter of oysters and a pint of Guinness, nab a table in the snug at the back and you\u2019ll soon forget all about the weather outside. Castle Leslie Estate, Co Monaghan If ever there were a place built for the winter, it\u2019s Castle Leslie. This is the kind of spot where you open the curtains in the morning and almost hope that the sky is grey, because it means you can tuck yourself up on the couch next to a roaring fire, grab a paper and relish this fortress of cosiness. There aren\u2019t any televisions in the quirky rooms, but you can head up to the secret cinema, put on an old movie and snuggle up under a blanket. Farrier and Draper, Dublin If you want to find a pub with a fireplace in Dublin, the various rooms inside Farrier and Draper are always bathed in a fireside glow. This eccentrically designed bar is filled with plush, deep velvet seats, where you can sink into the abyss and watch the fire crackle as you sip an Irish coffee. Visit during the day, and you can also wander through the bar into the Powerscourt Centre, a masterpiece of Georgian architecture filled with top-notch local boutiques. Bushmills Inn, Co Antrim What is it about winter that calls for a dram of whiskey? Sometimes, there\u2019s nothing better than finishing off the day with a nice hot toddy, and there\u2019s no better place to order one than in the Bushmills Inn. Just around the corner from what is claimed to be the world\u2019s oldest working distillery, this inn is a winter wonderland, filled with dark corners and cosy little nooks and crannies. The bar is illuminated by gas light, there\u2019s a tiny cinema, and upstairs there\u2019s a little reading nook stacked to the brim with tattered novels. Heaven. Stella Cinema, Dublin There\u2019s nothing novel about a trip to the cinema when there\u2019s a nip in the air. But Stella Cinema takes cosiness to another level. Here, you can choose from a plush, velvet armchair, a couch or even a double bed, where you can lie back and watch a movie in ultimate comfort. You can order (excellent) food from the on-site restaurant, which is delivered to your seat before the film starts, and the movies are a combination of new releases and classics. The Strand Bar, Strandhill, Sligo Part of the charm of the coastal village of Strandhill is the sense of achievement you feel after a blustery, windswept walk on the beautiful beach, followed by a pink-cheeked visit to one of the local pubs. The Strand Bar has plenty of fireplaces where you can warm the cockles, and there are regular traditional music sessions too. For the ultimate winter treat, pop into the nearby seaweed baths first, and immerse yourself in piping hot seaweed and seawater. You\u2019ll feel like a brand new person afterwards. Helen\u2019s Tower, Co Down The Irish Landmark Trust has a portfolio of incredible properties all around the island of Ireland, from tiny castles that sleep two, to lighthouses kitted out with four-poster beds and open fires. Just a 30-minute drive from Belfast, Helen\u2019s Tower is like something out of a fairytale, all stone turrets and vaulted, carved wooden ceilings. Climb the twisting stone staircases and you\u2019ll be met with incredible views of Co Down, as well as a dreamily comfy bedroom. Or you can just curl up by the open fire. Fill your heart with Ireland From the Causeway Coast and the Wild Atlantic Way to Ireland\u2019s Ancient East, and the 11 cities in between, Ireland has plenty to explore. Now\u2019s the time to start. Get inspired at ireland.com",

      "body": "<p>For the Conservative party\u2019s Manchester conference, the slogan was \u201cGet Brexit done\u201d. Yet again, Boris Johnson swears blind he\u2019s going to withdraw on schedule. A promise an unspecified number of single mothers have heard before.</p> <p>Unfortunately, this conference contained adult themes from the outset. Welcome to the errordome, where by day three it had been established that a table seating plan constitutes sexual consent; where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/01/police-called-tory-conference-mp-geoffrey-clifton-brown\" title=\"\">the 1922 Committee treasurer had been sent home for an altercation with security staff</a> right before the home secretary\u2019s speech on law and order; and where Dominic Cummings was still apparating in unexpected places wearing the same grey tracksuit. He\u2019s not so much an eminence grise as a tracksuit grise. Cummings now edits at least three of this country\u2019s newspapers, and had to leave the conference bar to escape all the young Tory dudes who wanted selfies with him. You\u2019ve heard of crisis-of-masculinity podcasts? You live in one.</p> <p>Instead of \u201cGet Brexit done\u201d, the Tories should really have co-opted the deathless title of that Succession episode <a href=\"https://tv.avclub.com/succession-invites-us-into-the-war-room-in-its-overwhel-1836321593\" title=\"\">Shit Show at the Fuck Factory</a>. Those words would have been a way more appropriate backdrop to the spectacle of various <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/30/boris-johnson-groping-a-womans-thigh-i-can-believe-that\" title=\"\">cabinet ministers squirming over whether the PM groping the upper inner thigh of a woman would be one of their personal red lines</a>. Pressed on the Charlotte Edwardes claims, Matt Hancock blathered that he did have red lines that would force his cabinet resignation, but he wasn\u2019t going to say them out loud. Oh, Matt. Is one of them \u201c<a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/culture/andy-king-fyre-festival-meme-netflix-blowjob-king-world-112190\" title=\"\">blowing a customs official to secure the release of the Fyre festival\u2019s Evian water</a>\u201d? Because, you know \u2026 convince me you wouldn\u2019t. Hancock went on to imply that unwanted touching of women was OK because Johnson has \u201cnever lectured other people on their private lives\u201d. Yup, shit show at the fuck factory.</p> <p>Still, here he comes, Sex Wonka, raising hopes and denying gropes. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ODN/status/1178962307302481921\" title=\"\">Boris Johnson\u2019s most amusing viral moment</a> from Manchester featured one aide passing him a cup, only for another aide to snatch it back with the hissed words: \u201cNo. Disposable. Cups.\u201d I suppose it\u2019s very remotely possible this is something to do with \u201cthe environment\u201d, though the cup didn\u2019t even get a single use. But surely the more likely theory is that the prime minister never uses a hairbrush or drinks out of disposable cups because he daren\u2019t risk a DNA test.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ca79c83536cae52e70327436bc0ff6211d75a9f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ca79c83536cae52e70327436bc0ff6211d75a9f/0_228_4848_2909/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tracksuit grise \u2026 Dominic Cummings.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tracksuit grise \u2026 Dominic Cummings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Veysey/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of the No 10 aides in question was Rob Oxley, a chap whose other eyecatching move at the conference was to enter the press room on Sunday evening with an imperious: \u201cOne from each, one from each.\u201d Once one reporter from each paper had been martialled, Oxley told them the Edwardes allegations were untrue. No questions permitted. Had he been under the dinner table in question at the time? Inquiring minds want to know.</p> <p>Britain is now basically governed by a Jeremy Kyle villain who knows the ancient Greek for humbug. Boris Johnson\u2019s own foreword to the conference programme declared that he felt, in Manchester, \u201cthe same throb of possibility every time I visit\u201d. As you\u2019d expect from someone whose personal philosophy is \u201cno throb unyielded to\u201d. Beyond the security cordon in the real country \u2013 all those wonderful people out there in the dark \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/04/election-polls-boris-johnson-jeremy-corbyn\" title=\"\">Johnson\u2019s latest polling puts him on a minus 18 approval rating</a>. He\u2019s as popular as ebola on a chemo ward \u2013 and yet, he is still 42 (FORTY-TWO) points ahead of Jeremy Corbyn.</p> <p>Having not seen a policy since three Christmases ago, the Tories now hallucinate five before breakfast. To kick off conference, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/29/from-40-hospitals-to-six-tories-nhs-numbers-dont-add-up\" title=\"\">Johnson announced he would be building 40 new hospitals</a>. (With what? Playmobil? Wine crates? We didn\u2019t hear; the figure later seems to have been commuted to six.) Andrew Bridgen literally proposed a monorail. Also being promised was limitless cheap nuclear energy within 20 years. This really is fully automated luxury WTFery. I\u2019m amazed they didn\u2019t float mining the asteroid belt. Maybe during the election.</p> <p>And so to the programme of events. Given where we are with Brexit, never has the usual portentous timetable looked more absurd. You could attend endless panels with titles such as \u201cAI: Could we? Should we?\u201d or \u201cThe future of capitalism\u201d. JUST TELL US WHAT\u2019S GOING TO HAPPEN IN FOUR WEEKS, YOU MAD BASTARDS. Johnson and Cummings\u2019 commitment to a no-spoilers Brexit is so total that they haven\u2019t even told Jacob Rees-Mogg or Arlene Foster their plan. But don\u2019t worry. As John Redwood put it: \u201cIt will work because we\u2019ve got some technology.\u201d</p> <p>But what technology? The Conservatives couldn\u2019t even update their conference app. Throughout the four days, it still showed a welter of what we might call ghost ship events, such as a big Q&amp;A with Rory Stewart, who was not in Manchester on account of not being in the Conservative party any more. Guys, you know if it\u2019s digital, you can update it at any time, yes? Maybe it\u2019s because the prime minister thinks \u201ctechnology lessons\u201d involve dancing poles. So they did try to change the app, but thought the way you did that was by twirling seductively into an inverted splits hold, while tossing your hair to Donna Summer\u2019s She Works Hard for the Money.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b70863be172f209ccff53232692875ba22b98e78\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b70863be172f209ccff53232692875ba22b98e78/0_528_4912_2947/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Feeling the strain \u2026 Johnson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Feeling the strain \u2026 Johnson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You could learn a lot from freeze-framing the conference at exactly the same point a year apart. On the Tuesday morning last year, prime minister Theresa May was asked in a radio interview about the manner in which Boris Johnson had stolen all her conference headlines. She replied: \u201cI\u2019m concentrating on what is important, which is getting a good deal for the UK.\u201d On the Tuesday morning this year, prime minister Boris Johnson was asked in a radio interview about Edwardes\u2019 headline account of his grope. He replied: \u201cI think what the public want to hear is about what we are doing to level up and unite the country.\u201d I wonder where we\u2019ll be in 2020. Maybe cabinet minister Nigel Farage will deflect from the emergence of his financial ties to the Russian government\u2019s covert sex robot building programme with the words: \u201cI am focused on what people want, which is delivering our domestic agenda.\u201d</p> <p>Like all his other urges, the PM can\u2019t suppress his irritation at even being asked about such things. How can this still be happening to him, now he is king of the gods? I do feel Johnson has been historically hampered by his inability to conduct assignations with mortal women by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leda_and_the_Swan\" title=\"\">disguising himself as a swan</a>, say, or <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana%C3%AB\" title=\"\">a shower of gold</a>. He has only ever taken the form of Boris Johnson. That said, there is an enchanting picture of Jennifer Arcuri \u2013 the grant-receiving model/tech entrepreneur in whose pole-dancing-equipped flat Johnson is reported to have had afternoon technology lessons \u2013 in which <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarinaHyde/status/1179289978951671808\" title=\"\">Arcuri is shown looming over a London mayor-themed cake</a>. In an image that might be captioned Attack of the 50 Foot Infosec Woman, Jennifer is gleefully biting the head of one of three fondant Boris Johnsons to adorn it. Did Zeus ever appear as an icing figurine? I must look it up before Priti Patel announces a book-burning initiative.</p> <p>In general, the hall reaction to speakers was muted. This is a revenue-gathering sort of gathering. In recent years, the dwindling band of elderly activists has been gradually replaced by an army of lobbyists for one form of Big Shittery or another. Even cabinet emoji Liz Truss could barely raise a laugh, while Patel should slap a whole life tariff on Northern Powerhouse minister Jake Berry for the following: \u201cThe only homes we are not going to build in the north of England is Sherlock Holmes!\u201d Jake, you can\u2019t even build a joke. It feels incredibly unlikely that you\u2019re going to be up to renewing the north.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d158009aa120397114c137de8368652cc3734653\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d158009aa120397114c137de8368652cc3734653/0_327_5644_3387/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Priti Patel.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Priti Patel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even Johnson didn\u2019t really do the business, and they missed yet another trick not making his entrance music Shaggy\u2019s It Wasn\u2019t Me. Declaiming welcome lies about having cleared up Britain\u2019s debt, and eyebrow-raisers like \u201cthe cocaine habits of the bourgeoisie\u201d, the prime minister looks like a man who answered a casting call searching for \u201ca Gary Busey type\u201d. He still dresses like someone who was last night banished to sleep in the car. Having said that, what was once a careless affectation increasingly begins to look essential. Not having a stylish uniform is one of the crucial bulwarks between Boris Johnson and a number of unfortunate historical #inspo<strong> </strong>associations.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just the use of terms like \u201csurrender act\u201d, which have to be said 437 times every day. This was a conference at which you could also repeatedly hear that parliament was illegitimate, the Benn Act was constitutionally illegitimate, and that the government could and should, in the words of one Brexiter, \u201csubvert it by any means necessary\u201d.</p> <p>On the fringe, panel composition tended toward the Sartrean. One completely packed event by the Bruges Group, held at Manchester\u2019s Comedy Store \u2013 leave it, it\u2019s not worth it \u2013 featured John Redwood, Mark Francois and Arlene Foster. All killers, no fillers. I\u2019m kidding, of course. There was actually a fourth panellist, in the form of a Brexit QC. But the main draw was Francois, who now gets the sort of reception you might expect Galatasaray fans to give Sergio Ramos if he signed for them. \u201cI\u2019ve got a feeling one or two of you might have heard Mark Francois speak before,\u201d trilled the chair, who went on to say that Mark \u201chas used his experience in the territorial army and his MA in war studies to great effect\u201d. A reminder that the definition of politics as the art of the possible is no substitute for wriggling through Epping Forest on your tummy dreaming of Rommel every second weekend.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c900572921219c5ac26987a826de3ae05224c6fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c900572921219c5ac26987a826de3ae05224c6fa/0_72_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Getting territorial \u2026 Mark Francois.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Getting territorial \u2026 Mark Francois.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henry Nicholls/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In fact, put like that it\u2019s incredible that we STILL haven\u2019t Brexited, until you remember that Mark has voted a full three times, and at every time of asking, not to leave the EU. Once he\u2019d announced his forthcoming book - it will be called You Couldn\u2019t Make It Up, a title previously used by both Jeremy Kyle and Richard Littlejohn \u2013 Mark\u2019s Bruges Group headline appearance concluded with a stark warning to parliamentarians. \u201cAsk not for whom the bell tolls,\u201d ran this thundering salvo. \u201cIt tolls for them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s amazing, isn\u2019t he?\u201d sighed the woman in the row behind me. I would estimate that at the Bruges Group, a scientific 83% of the women in the audience own cooking aprons printed with the torso of a French maid, would regard Boris Johnson disturbing their cobwebs as \u201ca bit of fun\u201d, and estimate there are between three and four units in an entire wine box. All of the above is the fault of 100% of the men at said event. \u201cI\u2019ve actually discovered we would have more sovereignty as a province of Canada,\u201d one stood up to drone. \u201cCould we apply to be a province of Canada?\u201d Do run along and have a crack, sir. I\u2019ll time you.</p> <p>Other personal lowlights? Watching someone who used to be David Cameron\u2019s adviser defending a Johnson grope. Over to this Alex Deane, who told Sky News: \u201cAs the late Alan Clark said: \u2018How do I know my advances are unwanted until I have made them?\u2019\u201d So glad we\u2019re ceding control of our boundaries to a deceased man, born in 1928, who named his dogs after Hitler and Leni Riefenstahl. Listen up, girls: you are getting a full house in crap sex bingo if Alex goes straight for your inner thigh, at the same time as honking: \u201cAnd THEN he said that Michael Heseltine had to buy his own furniture! Yes! Absolute legend!\u201d</p> <p>As it so happened, Alex woke up the next morning and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ajcdeane/status/1178967763093790721\" title=\"\">tweeted his regret</a> at having raised Clark\u2019s point: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t reflect my views, as anyone who knows me will know.\u201d Righto. Even so, one of my very strongest impressions from Manchester was that variations of the phrase \u201cThis is not the man I am\u201d will be used less and less. The Tory MP Sir Desmond Swayne has just got five unapologetic days of publicity out of wearing blackface. First came his column defending Justin Trudeau for doing it, and revealing he himself had worn blackface and would again. Next came the emergence of the pictures in question, at which Desmond took another bite of the apple and <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/desmond-swayne-blackface-tory-mp-racist-james-brown-justin-trudeau-a9123006.html\" title=\"\">again refused to apologise</a>. Meanwhile, outside of Johnson\u2019s speech, the biggest reaction I heard during entire conference was at the Bruges Group event, when a reporter asked the two MPs how they felt about Johnson saying Jo Cox would want Brexit to get done. People were actually baying at the journalist in support of Johnson. With the Charlotte Edwardes disclosure, a quick HazMat dive into social media will confirm that far from giving Johnson\u2019s base pause, it positively energised them.</p> <p>Releasing new polling on Monday, Michael Ashcroft\u2019s summary of his research over the past few weeks was that those making the comparison between Johnson and Donald Trump \u201cwere increasingly likely to mean it in a good way\u201d. Or as one of the PM\u2019s biggest fans, Katie Hopkins, put it: \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/kthopkins/status/1178589278311522304\" title=\"\">Better to be grabbed by the pussy than have a pussy as prime minister</a>.\u201d A real banquet of options, there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b5e59430fb45d80a6d0f7dc63526964b22131d23\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5e59430fb45d80a6d0f7dc63526964b22131d23/0_439_6585_3951/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Drowning in his own suit \u2026 Jacob Rees-Mogg.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Drowning in his own suit \u2026 Jacob Rees-Mogg.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Everywhere, Tories seemed to be trying out their new ironicidal style. Rees-Mogg, who still hasn\u2019t noticed his own tailor is trying to drown him, declared: \u201cBut as I grew up in the British establishment, I know how awful it is. I see its faults perhaps more clearly than most do, and its determination, its anti-democratic wish to cling to its power come what may.\u201d I am afraid the phrase \u201cDo me a favour\u201d is simply not up to the task of addressing that. See also John Redwood\u2019s claim that: \u201cAs good democrats we accepted the [EU referendum] result in 1975 and got on with making the best of it.\u201d</p> <p>Language is becoming unmoored from reality. An event called Challenging \u201cIslamophobia\u201d (scare quotes: Tories\u2019 own) turned out to be primarily concerned with ensuring the term wasn\u2019t used at all. The Taxpayers\u2019 Alliance ran two panels called \u201cIs the state killing free speech?\u201d and \u201cAm I allowed to say that?\u201d, featuring people who earn six-figure sums for saying whatever they like on prominent media platforms. Meanwhile, following an increasingly representative statement from Daniel Hannan, positively frothing with terms like \u201cjunta\u201d and \u201ccoup\u201d, the eminent war historian Lawrence Freedman <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LawDavF/status/1178974200788336643\" title=\"\">tweeted a reply</a>: \u201cWords like \u2018coup\u2019 and \u2018junta\u2019 have specific meanings. The Greeks were ruled by a real military junta from 1967 to 1974. These words have no meaning in situations where you just don\u2019t like what an elected parliament is doing.\u201d</p> <p>After these four days in Manchester, it\u2019s difficult to escape the impression that this kind of rationality is going rapidly out of fashion. We are firmly through the looking glass now, and the prime minister is playing ever more dangerously with the political matches. That IS the man he is. It DOES reflect the person those who know him would recognise. And a lot of people currently love him very much for it. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floreat_Etona!\" title=\"\">Floreat shitbird</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "For the Conservative party\u2019s Manchester conference, the slogan was \u201cGet Brexit done\u201d. Yet again, Boris Johnson swears blind he\u2019s going to withdraw on schedule. A promise an unspecified number of single mothers have heard before. Unfortunately, this conference contained adult themes from the outset. Welcome to the errordome, where by day three it had been established that a table seating plan constitutes sexual consent; where the 1922 Committee treasurer had been sent home for an altercation with security staff right before the home secretary\u2019s speech on law and order; and where Dominic Cummings was still apparating in unexpected places wearing the same grey tracksuit. He\u2019s not so much an eminence grise as a tracksuit grise. Cummings now edits at least three of this country\u2019s newspapers, and had to leave the conference bar to escape all the young Tory dudes who wanted selfies with him. You\u2019ve heard of crisis-of-masculinity podcasts? You live in one. Instead of \u201cGet Brexit done\u201d, the Tories should really have co-opted the deathless title of that Succession episode Shit Show at the Fuck Factory. Those words would have been a way more appropriate backdrop to the spectacle of various cabinet ministers squirming over whether the PM groping the upper inner thigh of a woman would be one of their personal red lines. Pressed on the Charlotte Edwardes claims, Matt Hancock blathered that he did have red lines that would force his cabinet resignation, but he wasn\u2019t going to say them out loud. Oh, Matt. Is one of them \u201cblowing a customs official to secure the release of the Fyre festival\u2019s Evian water\u201d? Because, you know \u2026 convince me you wouldn\u2019t. Hancock went on to imply that unwanted touching of women was OK because Johnson has \u201cnever lectured other people on their private lives\u201d. Yup, shit show at the fuck factory. Still, here he comes, Sex Wonka, raising hopes and denying gropes. Boris Johnson\u2019s most amusing viral moment from Manchester featured one aide passing him a cup, only for another aide to snatch it back with the hissed words: \u201cNo. Disposable. Cups.\u201d I suppose it\u2019s very remotely possible this is something to do with \u201cthe environment\u201d, though the cup didn\u2019t even get a single use. But surely the more likely theory is that the prime minister never uses a hairbrush or drinks out of disposable cups because he daren\u2019t risk a DNA test. One of the No 10 aides in question was Rob Oxley, a chap whose other eyecatching move at the conference was to enter the press room on Sunday evening with an imperious: \u201cOne from each, one from each.\u201d Once one reporter from each paper had been martialled, Oxley told them the Edwardes allegations were untrue. No questions permitted. Had he been under the dinner table in question at the time? Inquiring minds want to know. Britain is now basically governed by a Jeremy Kyle villain who knows the ancient Greek for humbug. Boris Johnson\u2019s own foreword to the conference programme declared that he felt, in Manchester, \u201cthe same throb of possibility every time I visit\u201d. As you\u2019d expect from someone whose personal philosophy is \u201cno throb unyielded to\u201d. Beyond the security cordon in the real country \u2013 all those wonderful people out there in the dark \u2013 Johnson\u2019s latest polling puts him on a minus 18 approval rating. He\u2019s as popular as ebola on a chemo ward \u2013 and yet, he is still 42 (FORTY-TWO) points ahead of Jeremy Corbyn. Having not seen a policy since three Christmases ago, the Tories now hallucinate five before breakfast. To kick off conference, Johnson announced he would be building 40 new hospitals. (With what? Playmobil? Wine crates? We didn\u2019t hear; the figure later seems to have been commuted to six.) Andrew Bridgen literally proposed a monorail. Also being promised was limitless cheap nuclear energy within 20 years. This really is fully automated luxury WTFery. I\u2019m amazed they didn\u2019t float mining the asteroid belt. Maybe during the election. And so to the programme of events. Given where we are with Brexit, never has the usual portentous timetable looked more absurd. You could attend endless panels with titles such as \u201cAI: Could we? Should we?\u201d or \u201cThe future of capitalism\u201d. JUST TELL US WHAT\u2019S GOING TO HAPPEN IN FOUR WEEKS, YOU MAD BASTARDS. Johnson and Cummings\u2019 commitment to a no-spoilers Brexit is so total that they haven\u2019t even told Jacob Rees-Mogg or Arlene Foster their plan. But don\u2019t worry. As John Redwood put it: \u201cIt will work because we\u2019ve got some technology.\u201d But what technology? The Conservatives couldn\u2019t even update their conference app. Throughout the four days, it still showed a welter of what we might call ghost ship events, such as a big Q&amp;A with Rory Stewart, who was not in Manchester on account of not being in the Conservative party any more. Guys, you know if it\u2019s digital, you can update it at any time, yes? Maybe it\u2019s because the prime minister thinks \u201ctechnology lessons\u201d involve dancing poles. So they did try to change the app, but thought the way you did that was by twirling seductively into an inverted splits hold, while tossing your hair to Donna Summer\u2019s She Works Hard for the Money. You could learn a lot from freeze-framing the conference at exactly the same point a year apart. On the Tuesday morning last year, prime minister Theresa May was asked in a radio interview about the manner in which Boris Johnson had stolen all her conference headlines. She replied: \u201cI\u2019m concentrating on what is important, which is getting a good deal for the UK.\u201d On the Tuesday morning this year, prime minister Boris Johnson was asked in a radio interview about Edwardes\u2019 headline account of his grope. He replied: \u201cI think what the public want to hear is about what we are doing to level up and unite the country.\u201d I wonder where we\u2019ll be in 2020. Maybe cabinet minister Nigel Farage will deflect from the emergence of his financial ties to the Russian government\u2019s covert sex robot building programme with the words: \u201cI am focused on what people want, which is delivering our domestic agenda.\u201d Like all his other urges, the PM can\u2019t suppress his irritation at even being asked about such things. How can this still be happening to him, now he is king of the gods? I do feel Johnson has been historically hampered by his inability to conduct assignations with mortal women by disguising himself as a swan, say, or a shower of gold. He has only ever taken the form of Boris Johnson. That said, there is an enchanting picture of Jennifer Arcuri \u2013 the grant-receiving model/tech entrepreneur in whose pole-dancing-equipped flat Johnson is reported to have had afternoon technology lessons \u2013 in which Arcuri is shown looming over a London mayor-themed cake. In an image that might be captioned Attack of the 50 Foot Infosec Woman, Jennifer is gleefully biting the head of one of three fondant Boris Johnsons to adorn it. Did Zeus ever appear as an icing figurine? I must look it up before Priti Patel announces a book-burning initiative. In general, the hall reaction to speakers was muted. This is a revenue-gathering sort of gathering. In recent years, the dwindling band of elderly activists has been gradually replaced by an army of lobbyists for one form of Big Shittery or another. Even cabinet emoji Liz Truss could barely raise a laugh, while Patel should slap a whole life tariff on Northern Powerhouse minister Jake Berry for the following: \u201cThe only homes we are not going to build in the north of England is Sherlock Holmes!\u201d Jake, you can\u2019t even build a joke. It feels incredibly unlikely that you\u2019re going to be up to renewing the north. Even Johnson didn\u2019t really do the business, and they missed yet another trick not making his entrance music Shaggy\u2019s It Wasn\u2019t Me. Declaiming welcome lies about having cleared up Britain\u2019s debt, and eyebrow-raisers like \u201cthe cocaine habits of the bourgeoisie\u201d, the prime minister looks like a man who answered a casting call searching for \u201ca Gary Busey type\u201d. He still dresses like someone who was last night banished to sleep in the car. Having said that, what was once a careless affectation increasingly begins to look essential. Not having a stylish uniform is one of the crucial bulwarks between Boris Johnson and a number of unfortunate historical #inspo associations. It\u2019s not just the use of terms like \u201csurrender act\u201d, which have to be said 437 times every day. This was a conference at which you could also repeatedly hear that parliament was illegitimate, the Benn Act was constitutionally illegitimate, and that the government could and should, in the words of one Brexiter, \u201csubvert it by any means necessary\u201d. On the fringe, panel composition tended toward the Sartrean. One completely packed event by the Bruges Group, held at Manchester\u2019s Comedy Store \u2013 leave it, it\u2019s not worth it \u2013 featured John Redwood, Mark Francois and Arlene Foster. All killers, no fillers. I\u2019m kidding, of course. There was actually a fourth panellist, in the form of a Brexit QC. But the main draw was Francois, who now gets the sort of reception you might expect Galatasaray fans to give Sergio Ramos if he signed for them. \u201cI\u2019ve got a feeling one or two of you might have heard Mark Francois speak before,\u201d trilled the chair, who went on to say that Mark \u201chas used his experience in the territorial army and his MA in war studies to great effect\u201d. A reminder that the definition of politics as the art of the possible is no substitute for wriggling through Epping Forest on your tummy dreaming of Rommel every second weekend. In fact, put like that it\u2019s incredible that we STILL haven\u2019t Brexited, until you remember that Mark has voted a full three times, and at every time of asking, not to leave the EU. Once he\u2019d announced his forthcoming book - it will be called You Couldn\u2019t Make It Up, a title previously used by both Jeremy Kyle and Richard Littlejohn \u2013 Mark\u2019s Bruges Group headline appearance concluded with a stark warning to parliamentarians. \u201cAsk not for whom the bell tolls,\u201d ran this thundering salvo. \u201cIt tolls for them.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s amazing, isn\u2019t he?\u201d sighed the woman in the row behind me. I would estimate that at the Bruges Group, a scientific 83% of the women in the audience own cooking aprons printed with the torso of a French maid, would regard Boris Johnson disturbing their cobwebs as \u201ca bit of fun\u201d, and estimate there are between three and four units in an entire wine box. All of the above is the fault of 100% of the men at said event. \u201cI\u2019ve actually discovered we would have more sovereignty as a province of Canada,\u201d one stood up to drone. \u201cCould we apply to be a province of Canada?\u201d Do run along and have a crack, sir. I\u2019ll time you. Other personal lowlights? Watching someone who used to be David Cameron\u2019s adviser defending a Johnson grope. Over to this Alex Deane, who told Sky News: \u201cAs the late Alan Clark said: \u2018How do I know my advances are unwanted until I have made them?\u2019\u201d So glad we\u2019re ceding control of our boundaries to a deceased man, born in 1928, who named his dogs after Hitler and Leni Riefenstahl. Listen up, girls: you are getting a full house in crap sex bingo if Alex goes straight for your inner thigh, at the same time as honking: \u201cAnd THEN he said that Michael Heseltine had to buy his own furniture! Yes! Absolute legend!\u201d As it so happened, Alex woke up the next morning and tweeted his regret at having raised Clark\u2019s point: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t reflect my views, as anyone who knows me will know.\u201d Righto. Even so, one of my very strongest impressions from Manchester was that variations of the phrase \u201cThis is not the man I am\u201d will be used less and less. The Tory MP Sir Desmond Swayne has just got five unapologetic days of publicity out of wearing blackface. First came his column defending Justin Trudeau for doing it, and revealing he himself had worn blackface and would again. Next came the emergence of the pictures in question, at which Desmond took another bite of the apple and again refused to apologise. Meanwhile, outside of Johnson\u2019s speech, the biggest reaction I heard during entire conference was at the Bruges Group event, when a reporter asked the two MPs how they felt about Johnson saying Jo Cox would want Brexit to get done. People were actually baying at the journalist in support of Johnson. With the Charlotte Edwardes disclosure, a quick HazMat dive into social media will confirm that far from giving Johnson\u2019s base pause, it positively energised them. Releasing new polling on Monday, Michael Ashcroft\u2019s summary of his research over the past few weeks was that those making the comparison between Johnson and Donald Trump \u201cwere increasingly likely to mean it in a good way\u201d. Or as one of the PM\u2019s biggest fans, Katie Hopkins, put it: \u201cBetter to be grabbed by the pussy than have a pussy as prime minister.\u201d A real banquet of options, there. Everywhere, Tories seemed to be trying out their new ironicidal style. Rees-Mogg, who still hasn\u2019t noticed his own tailor is trying to drown him, declared: \u201cBut as I grew up in the British establishment, I know how awful it is. I see its faults perhaps more clearly than most do, and its determination, its anti-democratic wish to cling to its power come what may.\u201d I am afraid the phrase \u201cDo me a favour\u201d is simply not up to the task of addressing that. See also John Redwood\u2019s claim that: \u201cAs good democrats we accepted the [EU referendum] result in 1975 and got on with making the best of it.\u201d Language is becoming unmoored from reality. An event called Challenging \u201cIslamophobia\u201d (scare quotes: Tories\u2019 own) turned out to be primarily concerned with ensuring the term wasn\u2019t used at all. The Taxpayers\u2019 Alliance ran two panels called \u201cIs the state killing free speech?\u201d and \u201cAm I allowed to say that?\u201d, featuring people who earn six-figure sums for saying whatever they like on prominent media platforms. Meanwhile, following an increasingly representative statement from Daniel Hannan, positively frothing with terms like \u201cjunta\u201d and \u201ccoup\u201d, the eminent war historian Lawrence Freedman tweeted a reply: \u201cWords like \u2018coup\u2019 and \u2018junta\u2019 have specific meanings. The Greeks were ruled by a real military junta from 1967 to 1974. These words have no meaning in situations where you just don\u2019t like what an elected parliament is doing.\u201d After these four days in Manchester, it\u2019s difficult to escape the impression that this kind of rationality is going rapidly out of fashion. We are firmly through the looking glass now, and the prime minister is playing ever more dangerously with the political matches. That IS the man he is. It DOES reflect the person those who know him would recognise. And a lot of people currently love him very much for it. Floreat shitbird.",

Barr and US attorney John Durham met the officials after getting authorisation from the Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, the Corriere della Sera reported. The scope of Barr\u2019s investigation in Rome was to find out whether Italy had played a role in the so-called Russiagate affair, whether secret documents had been obtained and, in particular, to collate information on Joseph Mifsud, a Maltese professor who allegedly told Trump\u2019s former campaign aide George Papadopoulos in 2016 that the Kremlin was in possession of thousands of emails that revealed \u201cdirt\u201d about Hillary Clinton that could help Trump\u2019s campaign.

According to Mueller, Mifsud said the Kremlin was sitting on \u201cthousands of emails\u201d hacked from the Democratic party, which could damage Hillary Clinton. At the time, the Democrats were unaware their servers had been breached. Russian GRU military intelligence was behind the hack, Mueller found. Barr\u2019s latest trip to Rome comes two months after he met UK intelligence agencies in London to discuss Britain potentially cooperating with Trump\u2019s administration on the inquiry examining the FBI\u2019s investigation into the alleged collusion with Russia, sources told the Guardian. Corriere reported that Barr first came to Rome in mid-August, when he met Gennaro Vecchione, the director general of the security intelligence department (DIS). During the latest visit he met Vecchione again, before meeting Luciano Carta, the chief of the external intelligence and security agency (AISE) and his counterpart, Mario Parente, at the internal intelligence and security agency (AISI). Corriere said the meetings were held at the DIS headquarters in Rome, although other sources claim they took place at the office of the American embassy. The embassy was unable to confirm whether the meeting was held in its offices at Palazzo Margherita, but a justice department spokesperson, Kerri Kupec, confirmed on Monday that a team led by Durham was gathering information from several foreign countries. \u201cAs the Department of Justice has previously announced, a team led by US attorney John Durham is investigating the origins of the US counter-intelligence probe of the Trump 2016 presidential campaign,\u201d Kupec said. \u201cMr Durham is gathering information from numerous sources, including a number of foreign countries. At attorney general Barr\u2019s request, the president has contacted other countries to ask them to introduce the attorney general and Mr Durham to appropriate officials.\u201d The Daily Beast reported on Wednesday that Barr and Durham met Italian agents at the US embassy in Rome, where they were shown evidence that Italy had on Mifsud, including a tape he handed over to the authorities when he applied for police protection after disappearing in October 2017. On the tape, he reportedly explained why he might be in danger. Italy\u2019s ministry of justice would not immediately confirm whether its officials were also involved in the Rome meetings. The news of Barr\u2019s latest visit emerged as the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, began a three-day visit to Italy on Tuesday. Pompeo has met Conte and the president, Sergio Mattarella, and will also be visiting his ancestral home in the Abruzzo region. Barr is reportedly pressing a range of foreign powers to cooperate with his effort to piece together the origins of the FBI investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s links with Russia. Barr\u2019s critics claim he is seeking to discredit the FBI investigation by constructing a vast conspiracy theory that foreign powers were working to secure Hillary Clinton\u2019s election in 2016. The inquiry by the special counsel Robert Mueller showed that Russia was attempting to swing the presidential election in favour of Trump. \u201cThe FBI and other US agencies concluded that Russian interference in the 2016 election was \u2018sweeping and systematic\u2019,\u201d it said. Barr\u2019s counter-attack has been given an added urgency as Trump seeks to find a way to block potential impeachment hearings. The president is facing claims he threatened to withdraw military aid from Ukraine unless it cooperated with his efforts to find dirt on the former US vice-president Joe Biden, a potential challenger in the 2020 presidential election. Before vanishing, Mifsud denied any wrongdoing but said he had helped to connect Papadopolous with Russian officials. Italian newspapers reported earlier this year that for seven months after his disappearance, Mifsud had been staying in an apartment in Rome that was allegedly rented out by Link Campus University, where Mifsud had taught. At the time, the university denied any knowledge of Mifsud\u2019s whereabouts. Link Campus University is where the Five Star Movement, which is ruling in coalition with the centre-left Democratic party, introduced its manifesto and recruited two of its ministers.",

      "bodyText": "Linda Edwards is the family authority on all matters of politics. Every election year, she watches the news, studies the candidates, attends campaign events and renders a verdict. A year before the 2020 election, the 68-year-old retired pharmacist from Charlotte has her work cut out: 19 Democrats vying to be the Democratic presidential nominee. Yet with five months left before voting begins in the primary race, Edwards says she is ready to make an endorsement. \u201cElizabeth Warren is the absolute greatest,\u201d Edwards said of the Massachusetts senator after waiting for more than an hour to take a selfie with her at a recent campaign event in Rock Hill, South Carolina. \u201cI always had her at the top of the list but she is the No 1 now. I totally support her.\u201d Since entering the race nine months ago, Warren has steadily gained ground with ambitious policy proposals, a decision to swear-off high-dollar fundraising events and her hours-long selfie lines. But if she is to win the nomination, it will likely be with the help of African American voters such as Edwards, part of an increasingly powerful and decisive constituency in the Democratic party. A spate of recent polls show Warren edging past Joe Biden in the first two early-voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire, home to predominantly white electorates. But in South Carolina, where African American voters make up an estimated 60% of Democratic primary voters, Biden still enjoys a wide lead. In South Carolina, known as the Palmetto State, which holds the \u201cfirst in the south\u201d primary on 29 February next year, Biden leads Warren by 21 points, according to a CNN poll released this week. Although they draw the same share of support from white primary voters in the state, 45% of black Democrats back Biden compared to just 4% who favor Warren. \u201cI don\u2019t know how anyone can become the Democratic nominee \u2013 or the next president of the United States, for that matter \u2013 without strong, across-the-board support from African American voters,\u201d said Antjuan Seawright, a Democratic strategist in South Carolina, who is not aligned with a candidate. \u201cSouth Carolina is the first test of that support.\u201d The event at Clinton College in Rock Hill on Saturday highlighted the challenge for Warren as she works to introduce herself to African Americans in the state. Despite the unbearable heat and humidity, nearly 1,400 attended her outdoor rally, and hundreds stayed afterward for selfies. Yet the crowd that blanketed the campus of this historically black college was overwhelmingly white. Biden drew a smaller, but more diverse, crowd when he visited the college earlier this year. Biden\u2019s dominance in the state rests on his deep ties to black political leaders and his service as Barack Obama\u2019s vice-president, which have made him popular among older, more conservative black voters. \u201cWe trust him,\u201d said Steve Love, a local councilman in neighboring York, who endorsed Biden. \u201cObama is not got going to elect a vice-president who doesn\u2019t have our back.\u201d Love met Warren before her rally and offered \u201cpoint-blank\u201d advice. \u201cIf you want to make gains in our community, you are really going to have to come into our community and sit down and talk to us,\u201d he told her. Warren says she has plans to do just that. \u201cWhat I\u2019m doing is showing up and trying to talk to people about why I\u2019m in this fight, about what\u2019s broken, about how to fix it and how we\u2019re building a grassroots movement to get it done,\u201d Warren told reporters after the rally. \u201cIt\u2019s not just one policy. It\u2019s everywhere.\u201d Woven into her raft of police proposals are specific prescriptions to address racial injustice. Her proposal to forgive most student loan debt and make college tuition-free attempts to reduce the racial wealth gap that disproportionately burdens black students. The proposal would also invest $50m in historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), such as Clinton. Her affordable housing policy specifically aims to redress decades of discriminatory housing practices and redlining in places such as the Mississippi Delta, where she went early in her campaign to highlight the initiative. She was one of the first candidates to endorse congressional legislation that would create a commission to study reparations for the descendants of slaves. And at a recent forum on LGBTQ issues in Iowa last week, Warren began her remarks by reading the names of 18 black transgender women killed this year. \u201cIt is time for a president of the United States of America to say their names,\u201d she said. \u201cBlack folks have a very unique experience that requires policies that pinpoint that experience,\u201d said Maurice Mitchell, the national director of the Working Families party, a progressive political organization that endorsed Warren. \u201cThe candidates who aren\u2019t afraid to talk about race and class at the same time, those are the candidates that are going to compel black people to not just show up at the polls,\u201d he continued, \u201cbut to get involved, to volunteer, to engage and to build a movement with them.\u201d Black voters, and black women in particular, are the most loyal Democratic voting bloc. In 2016, African Americans comprised nearly a quarter, 24%, of Democratic primary voters \u2013 a share that is expected to rise in 2020. There are signs Warren\u2019s efforts are paying off, especially among African American women. A Quinnipiac poll showed that her support among black voters nationally climbed over the summer from 4% in July to 19% in September as Biden\u2019s support slipped from 53% in July to 40% in September. At several presidential forums focused on voters of color and in private meetings with activists and black leaders this year, Warren has left her audiences impressed, said Aimee Allison, founder of She the People, political advocacy group focused on women of color that hosted an event with 2020 candidates in Houston earlier this year. \u201cShe is campaigning directly to women of color,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd at the same time, she is attracting white progressives. That has the potential to be a potent coalition.\u201d Cliff Albright, cofounder of Black Voters Matter, said fresh scrutiny of Biden\u2019s record and his recent remarks on race \u2013 from comments about working with segregationists to a discordant reply to a debate question about reparations \u2013 are starting to chip away at his support, especially among younger black voters. \u201cThe more that black people hear from Elizabeth Warren, the more they are intrigued by her,\u201d Albright said. \u201cThe opposite happens with Joe Biden.\u201d But public opinion surveys and interviews with voters suggest Biden\u2019s appeal may be more durable than many expect.

Abbott later said: \u201cWhether it\u2019s women members in this house, women claiming benefits, women\u2019s reproductive rights in Northern Ireland, and the failure to support women workers at Thomas Cook, isn\u2019t this a government letting women down?\u201d Raab replied: \u201cOn this side of the house we\u2019re proud to be on our second female prime minister.\u201d In her concluding remarks, Abbott said: \u201cThe foreign secretary hasn\u2019t mentioned the fact there are over 600,000 more women and girls in poverty now than in 2010. \u201cI was a member of this house when Tory MPs defenestrated the then female prime minister, Mrs Thatcher, and I\u2019ve been a member of this house when Tory MPs worked their will to the immediate female prime minister. \u201cIt seems to me that Tory members of parliament may on occasion make women their leaders but they need to learn how to treat them less cruelly.\u201d Raab replied: \u201cCan I just gently say to the shadow home secretary that in relation to Margaret Thatcher, if she wants to talk about treating them better, she might have a word with the shadow chancellor [John McDonnell] who talked about going back in time to assassinate her. That\u2019s not appropriate language on her side.\u201d",

Chinese markets are closed for a one-week holiday. </p> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones fell 1.28% and the S&amp;P 500 lost 1.2% to hit four-week lows. Selling was triggered after the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s index of factory activity, a closely-watched survey, dropped 1.3 points to 47.8, the lowest level since June 2009. A reading below 50 indicates contraction in the manufacturing sector.</p> <p>The German and the UK factory readings were 41.7 and 48.3 respectively, also indicating further contraction. The French manufacturing sector barely expanded, with a reading of 50.1.</p> <p>David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Looking at the broader picture, it is fair to say that the worldwide manufacturing sector is in trouble.

The best dealers can hope for is a de-escalation in trade tensions, but it is obvious that the damage has been done.</p> </blockquote> <p>In the UK, prime minister Boris Johnson is expected to set out his plans for the UK\u2019s departure from the EU, with the Irish border in focus.

      "bodyText": "The sell-off in world stock markets is gathering pace as traders fret about the global manufacturing recession, the fallout from trade wars on the US economy and a potential no-deal Brexit. Dow Jones down nearly 300 points, or 1.12%, at 26,276.37 S&amp;P 500 down 35 points, or 1.19%, at 2905.23 Nasdaq down 1.24%, or 98 points, at 7810.56 FTSE 100 index down 2.55%, or 188 points, at 7172.56 Germany\u2019s Dax down 1.88%, or 230 points, at 12,033.58 CAC down 2.3%, or 129 points, at 5468.51 Italy\u2019s FTSE Mib down 1.61%, or 352 points, at 21,573.23 The pound, which fell 0.6% against the dollar this morning and 0.4% against the euro, has largely recovered. It is now down 0.06% against the dollar at $1.2298, and 0.19% lower versus the euro at \u20ac1.1234. We are signing off for today and will be back tomorrow. Thank you for all your comments. The sell-off on Wall Street is gathering pace \u2013 the Nasdaq, Dow and S&amp;P 500 are all down 1%, shortly after the opening bell. The ADP monthly payrolls report disappointed the market today. Private-sector companies in the US hired 135,000 more workers in September, while some had expected 140,000 more jobs. It was the smallest gain since June. Crucially, the previous month\u2019s reading was revised sharply lower to 157,000 from 195,000. This doesn\u2019t bode well for the official payrolls figures, out on Friday\u2026 Wall Street has fallen at the open. Dow Jones down 184 points, or 0.69%, at 26,338.63 S&amp;P 500 down 19 points, or 0.65%, at 2921.10 Nasdaq down 57 points, or 0.73%, at 7850.87 And in Europe, the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index and France\u2019s CAC are on track for their biggest daily falls since 5 August. Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, says businesses across the UK want the Prime Minister to get a Brexit deal \u2013 not just get Brexit done. He warned of the economic chaos that would follow a no-deal departure from the EU. The prime minister repeated his wish to reach an agreement with the EU, but over the next two weeks businesses need to see these intentions turn into concrete reality. In the real world, companies are still facing a nail-biting period ahead and the unwanted prospect of a messy and disorderly exit on the 31st of October. The reality is that neither the UK government nor many businesses are fully ready for a no-deal exit from the EU on the 31st of October. No one should downplay the disruption and economic dislocation that would be caused by a messy departure. So, to recap: Sterling fell 0.6% against the dollar this morning but is off its lows, trading 0.07% lower at $1.2296. It has also recovered against the euro, down 0.05% at \u20ac1.1250. Boris Johnson\u2019s keynote speech at the Conservative party conference in Manchester had next to no impact on markets however. Shares around the globe are being hammered by fears over economic growth and the fallout from the US-China trade war. The selling was triggered by poor manufacturing surveys in the US, Europe and China in the last couple of days, and a dismal construction report for the UK this morning. In the UK, that\u2019s been compounded by Brexit worries. The FTSE 100 index is the biggest faller among Europe\u2019s main stock markets. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index has hit a one-month low, falling 1.6%. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index down 2.18%, or 160.57 points, at 7199.75 Germany\u2019s Dax down 1.27% at 12,108.30 France\u2019s CAC down 1.67% at 5504.40 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB down 1.33% at 21,635.09 Here are our full stories on chairman Vernon Hill\u2019s departure from Metro Bank, the lender he founded in 2010, and the creation of the world\u2019s biggest online betting firm, led by the owner of Paddy Power. The \u00a310bn all-share deal will bring together Flutter Entertainment, the owner of Paddy Power and Betfair, and The Stars Group (TSG), which owns Sky Bet and Poker Stars. Sterling is off its lows, now down about 0.1% against both the dollar and the euro. It was little moved immediately after Johnson\u2019s speech, when it traded down 0.4% against the dollar and 0.3% lower against the euro. The Institute of Directors has reacted cautiously to the prime minister\u2019s speech in Manchester. Its director of policy, Edwin Morgan, said: Business leaders keenly hope there is space for a deal, but we are fast running out of road. We await the details behind the government\u2019s proposals, but the issues in addressing the Irish border are not just technical in nature, and they can\u2019t be treated in isolation. Moreover, avoiding a hard border can\u2019t put the compliance burden so high on businesses that it aggravates the existing challenges while creating a whole new set of problems. The lobby once again warned that a no-deal exit would \u201cnot relieve uncertainty but exacerbate it,\u201d squashing investment and distracting ever further from urgent domestic issues. We will continue to do all we can to help firms prepare for the potential impact of no deal, but for many, the injurious effects of a disorderly Brexit simply cannot be planned away. On top of this, there is still no confirmation of no deal tariff changes or any further detail since March on how trade across the Irish border will be managed in practice. Small firms need this clarity as well as targeted assistance to see them through the Brexit tumult. Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid says: What is hard to argue with is that the global manufacturing sector is now very much in a recession. This now makes an already important Fed meeting later this month even more of a crucial risk event. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the second time this year in September and indicated that future rates cuts would depend on the economic data. My economics colleague Phillip Inman has also looked at today\u2019s moves in markets. The World Trade Organization warned yesterday that the outbreak of tariff wars pose a threat to jobs and living standards as it slashed its forecast for trade growth during 2019. Stock futures are pointing to a lower open on Wall Street, after US shares hit a one-month low yesterday following the ISM manufacturing shock. The Dow Jones is expected to open 160 points, or 0.6% lower, while the S&amp;P 500 is seen down nearly 17 points, or 0.57% , and the Nasdaq is set to open more than 50 points down, a 0.68% drop. Our Brexit correspondent Lisa O\u2019Carroll has just spoken to Boris Johnson\u2019s dad. Meanwhile, Thomas Cook staff who lost their jobs when the 178-year-old travel company collapsed at the beginning of last week, are protesting in Westminster. They have handed in petitions at Downing Street and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). to demand an urgent inquiry into the firm\u2019s demise. \u201cLet\u2019s get Brexit done,\u201d Johnson repeats, as he finishes his speech. He spoke for about 45 minutes, and stuck to his mantra of the UK leaving the EU by 31 October. Markets were unmoved by his comments as they contained few details of the Brexit negotiations. There has been little impact on sterling. The pound is still down 0.4% against the dollar at $1.2255 and 0.3% lower against the euro at \u20ac1.1219. The FTSE 100 index continues to slide. It\u2019s now down more than 150 points at 7209.61, a 2.05% drop. Boris Johnson is giving his keynote speech at the Tory party conference in Manchester. More on our politics live blog here. You can read more on Ofgem\u2019s website. Ofgem has appointed Jonathan Brearley, its current executive director for systems and networks, as chief executive. He will take over from Dermot Nolan at the end of February. The energy watchdog\u2019s chairman Martin Cave said: Jonathan will take up his new role at a time of unparalleled change in the energy industry in order to meet the pressing need to decarbonise. Ofgem\u2019s role is to ensure that consumers, especially the vulnerable are protected from sharp practice and receive fair treatment. Brexit headlines popping up on Reuters: A European Commission spokeswoman says the commission president Jean-Claude Juncker will hold a call with Boris Johnson at 3:15pm GMT (2:15pm BST). She says the EU will examine objectively any UK proposals, and stresses that the EU wants a deal. She adds that a legally operable solution must be reached that meets all goals of the Irish \u201cbackstop\u201d. The pound is now down 0.42% against the dollar, off earlier lows when it was down 0.6%; it\u2019s also recouped some ground against the euro, although it is still 0.26% lower against the single currency. There are only three risers on the FTSE 100 index at the moment: Flutter is up nearly 20% following the near \u00a310bn merger gambling deal that will unite the owners of Paddy Power and Poker Stars. Tesco is 0.5% ahead and metals mining firmn Polymetal International is the third gainer, up 0.4%. The FTSE as a whole continues to slide on global growth and Brexit worries. It is down 1.74%, or 128 points, at 7232.20. Returning to the main UK corporate story today, the surprise departure of Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis, my colleague Kalyeena Makortoff has done a profile of the new Tesco boss, Ken Murphy, who will take over next summer. The 52-year-old Irishman is described as a \u201cBoots lifer,\u201d who has spent his entire career so far in health and beauty retail. Equities are in full retreat this morning, with European stock exchanges shedding 1% or more. Markets have been hit by yesterday\u2019s US manufacturing shock, poor UK construction figures this morning and fears that Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit offer will not lead to an agreement with the EU. The FTSE 100 index in London is the worst-performing market, down 1.65% or 121 points at 7238.41. Sterling has slid nearly 0.6% to $1.2233. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at online trading firm IG, says: The risk-off atmosphere created by yesterday\u2019s US ISM [manufacturing] miss continues to hang over markets. European equities have turned firmly lower in early trading, on the very reasonable assumption that, if things are that bad for the US, then they must be even worse for Europe. And right on cue, German GDP forecasts have been downgraded. Following the theme, it is clear that a tough outlook for Germany makes things even worse for southern Europe\u2019s moribund economies, with or without another half-hearted dose of QE from the ECB. We are rapidly moving away from the realms of what central banks can do, but governments refuse to pick up the slack. How long equities can remain immune in such an environment remains to be seen. Mark Robinson, chief executive of public sector procurement firm Scape Group, says it is concerning that construction activity is falling steeply at the start of autumn. We are seeing the biggest decline in new work, new orders and employment levels for a decade, when we were in the middle of a financial crisis. The parallels between now and then cannot be ignored. We are facing significant economic upheaval with no end to the uncertainty in sight and the construction sector is responding accordingly, with both public and private sector clients exercising caution. Civil engineering work, which represents essential road and rail projects that keep our local communities moving and our economies growing, are grinding to a halt and even big ticket items like HS2 are being called into question. We desperately need clarity from the government on their legislative programme and detail on whether the EU is going to accept Boris\u2019 proposed deal. Provide us with this clarity and businesses will finally be able to make decisions on projects that have been paused and pushed to the side. We shouldn\u2019t hold our breathe and hope for an immediate Brexit bounce, but we can be mildly optimistic that there will be an up-tick in activity. The UK construction survey also showed that companies\u2019 input prices rose strongly, as the weaker pound pushed up the cost of fuel and imported materials, such as tiles from Spain. Hayes of IHS Markit warned of a long slump in Britain\u2019s construction industry. Low confidence has subsequently caused construction order books to fall substantially. Panellists reported another sharp drop in demand in September that was one of the strongest in the post-crisis era. Forward-looking indicators suggest that businesses are bracing themselves for a protracted construction slump, with input purchasing and employment both falling at rates unsurpassed since 2010. Overall, the performance of the UK economy once again hinges on the service sector showing a marked degree of resilience to offset the weakness seen in construction and manufacturing. Noble Francis, economics director at the Construction Products Association and honorary Professor at the Bartlett School of Construction of Project Management at UCL in London, tweeted: IHS Markit/CIPS, which compiled the UK construction survey, said Brexit uncertainty was to blame for the latest decline in activity. Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, said The UK construction sector remained mired in a downturn at the end of the third quarter, according to the latest PMI data. Activity is being pulled down at its second-fastest clip for over a decade as firms are buffeted by client hesitancy, heightened Brexit uncertainty and a weak outlook for the UK economy. The commercial sector was a notable casualty in September, with building activity here falling at the fastest rate since April 2009, highlighting the damaging effects of project delays and belt-tightening. The pound has also fallen further, sinking 0.5% against the dollar to $1.2241. Against the euro, it is 0.3% lower, at \u20ac1.1223. Markets fear that Boris Johnson\u2019s proposal to replace the Irish border \u201cbackstop\u201d will not secure a Brexit agreement with the EU. Neil Jones, head of European hedge fund sales at Japanese bank Mizuho, told Reuters: I don\u2019t sense an agreement between the two sides. We\u2019ll see a lower sterling [going forward]. The FTSE 100 index has tumbled more than 100 points to 7252.44, a 1.47% decline, as traders worry about the worsening economic outlook around the globe. Jobs in the construction sector are being cut at the fastest pace since December 2010. The downturn has spread across all areas, with commercial construction the worst-performing. The UK\u2019s construction industry is shrinking at a faster pace, according to the latest PMI survey. The headline reading fell to 43.3 in September from 45 in August. IHS Markit/CIPS, who compile the monthly survey, said: Building activity fell at the second-fastest rate since April 2009, only narrowly outpaced by June\u2019s decline. A historically steep drop in new orders was also registered, while firms trimmed employment at the fastest rate since the end of 2010 due to unfavourable demand, client hesitancy and low confidence. Adding to the economic gloom sparked by yesterday\u2019s dismal manufacturing numbers in the US and elsewhere, Germany\u2019s leading economic institutes have slashed their growth forecasts. Germany, Europe\u2019s biggest economy, is now seen growing 0.5% this year and 1.1% next, compared with April estimates of 0.8% and 1.8%. The institutes are predicting a recovery to 1.4% growth in 2021. The institutes said: An economic crisis with a pronounced underutilisation of the German economy is ... not in sight, although the cyclical downside risks are currently high. The revisions feed into the German government\u2019s own growth projections. There are mounting concerns that Germany\u2019s slowdown, driven by a recession in its export-reliant manufacturing sector, will affect the rest of Europe. Analysts at Daiwa say: In the currency market, after a modest bounce yesterday afternoon, sterling is weakening again (close to 0.89/\u20ac) ahead of Boris Johnson\u2019s speech to the Conservative Party conference which, amid the jingoism, will see him preach to the converted about his imminent Brexit proposals. It remains to be seen, however, how much (honest) detail about those plans \u2013 extraordinarily, the first he\u2019ll have made since the referendum more than three years ago \u2013 will actually be made available today. However, the substance reported in the press suggests proposals that have minimal chance of being agreed by the EU, and seem designed principally to allow Johnson to blame the Europeans for any failure to reach a deal before the end of October. Of course, our baseline forecast is still that the Article 50 deadline will be extended we still expect. Shares are also being hammered by rising global economic gloom, after yesterday\u2019s US manufacturing shock and poor factory surveys in the UK and the rest of Europe. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 down 1.2% Germany\u2019s Dax down 0.9% France\u2019s CAC down 1% Spain\u2019s Ibex down 0.8% Malcolm Barr, economist at JPMorgan Chase, is sceptical that Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit offer will be well received in Brussels. Although the UK has moved towards the EU position a little, we doubt the EU will regard it as viable basis upon which to begin a detailed negotiation at this stage. As we wrote yesterday, expect acrimony to ensue. According to some media reports, the UK is set to withdraw from the talks if the EU do not respond positively to the proposal outlined today. The FTSE 100 index is now more than 80 points lower, at 7277.04 - a decline of 1.14%. The pound is also down as just discussed. Markets are decidedly nervous as they wait for Boris Johnson to unveil his final Brexit offer. My colleagues on politics write: In his speech to the Conservative party conference in Manchester on Wednesday, the embattled prime minister will outline what he will call a \u201cfair and reasonable compromise\u201d, which Downing Street says has been drawn up after 70 hours of discussions with other EU member states. He will insist that if the EU27 fails to engage with his proposals, he will press ahead with a no-deal Brexit at the end of October. Brussels has warned there will be a cold reception if the offer resembles draft proposals leaked on Monday, which would involve customs clearance sites five to 10 miles from the Irish border \u2013 later denied by Johnson. The pound is lower this morning, despite news that Boris Johnson has struck a secret deal with the Democratic Unionist party. Sterling is trading 0.22% lower against the dollar at $1.1236, and has slipped 0.12% against the euro, to \u20ac1.1240. Here is our story: Boris Johnson has struck a secret deal with the Democratic Unionist party involving radical proposals for a Belfast-Dublin \u201cbilateral lock\u201d on post-Brexit arrangements on the island of Ireland. Details have emerged of the prime minister\u2019s final Brexit offer that he will lay out on Wednesday, with Northern Ireland staying under EU single market regulations for agri-food and manufactured goods until at least 2025, at which point its assembly in Stormont will decide whether to continue alignment with EU or UK standards. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at trading platform Spreadex, says: Reports that Boris Johnson has struck a deal with the DUP failed to lift sterling\u2019s spirits on Wednesday, mainly because the \u2018two borders\u2019 plan is unlikely to how much sway with Dublin or the EU. That left cable down 0.2%, at its own one-month nadir of $1.2276, with the pound also dipping 0.1% against the euro to lurk at its worst price in approaching 3-weeks. Vernon Hill, the chairman and founder of Britain\u2019s troubled Metro Bank, will also step down, by the end of the year. Metro Bank has yet to find a successor. The lender has seen its shares plummet around 90% this year after disclosing an accounting error, and amid concerns that its branch-reliant business model could prove outdated in an industry that is going digital. Michael Snyder, an independent director at Metro Bank, says: The board shares Vernon\u2019s view that Metro Bank has now reached a point where an independent chairperson is appropriate to oversee the next stage of our journey. Metro Bank opened in London in 2010 - the first new bank to open on Britain\u2019s high streets for more than a century. It hoped to lure customers with a flexible and efficient service - and by being dog-friendly. In the gambling world, the owners of Paddy Power Betfair and Poker Stars are merging in a \u00a39.3bn deal to create one of the world\u2019s biggest online betting and gambling companies. Shares in Flutter Entertainment jumped 15% after the firm, formerly known as Paddy Power Betfair, said it would combine with Stars Group, the Nasdaq- and Toronto-listed owner of Poker Stars in an all-share deal. Combined annual revenues are about \u00a33.8bn and the new company will have around 4 million active customers. The companies say the new group will be a global leader in sports betting and gaming, just as the huge US market opens up. It\u2019s been 16 months since the US Supreme Court cleared the way for states to legalise sports betting. Following the merger, shareholders of Flutter will have 54.64% of the new company, while Stars Group investors will own the rest. It will be headquartered in Dublin. Let\u2019s take a look at the corporate news. Tesco\u2019s boss Dave Lewis has announced his surprise departure after five years in charge of the UK\u2019s biggest retailer. He will be replaced next summer by Ken Murphy, formerly chief commercial officer at American retail giant Walgreens Boots Alliance. Lewis said: My decision to step down as group chief executive is a personal one. I believe that the tenure of the chief executive should be a finite one and that now is the right time to pass the baton. The leadership team is very strong, our strategy is clear and it is delivering. I have no doubt that Tesco will kick on again under new leadership next year. The FTSE 100 index in London has lost 48 points at the open, falling 0.65% to 7312.22. The UK bluechip index is the worst faller among the main stock markets in Europe, amid Brexit worries. Germany\u2019s Dax down 0.3% France\u2019s CAC down 0.2% Spain\u2019s Ibex down 0.2% Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB down 0.25% Paul Donovan, an economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, is back after being suspended in June for making controversial comments about swine fever in China. His thoughts on manufacturing are: Globally, the gap between sentiment and reality is the widest since 2012. Trade taxes worry manufacturers. When asked, manufacturers say they are less than happy about life, but their actions are more positive. Investors should worry about trade taxes. They should not panic about sentiment. He also notes: Global bond yields rose yesterday. Some yield curves steepened. Do steeper yield curves predict an economic boom? They do not, any more than inversions predict a recession. Weaker bond markets reflected a poor Japanese auction. This reflected fewer \u201ccaptive\u201d investors (who buy for non-economic reasons). Such investors distort bond markets and bond market signals. In the interminably tedious EU-UK divorce process, UK Prime Minister Johnson speaks at the Conservative Party conference. Exit proposals to the EU are expected. There is no certainty among investors about the proposals, if the EU will agree a deal, if the British Parliament will pass a deal, or if Johnson will remain as prime minister. Iaroslav Shelepko and Akash Utsav, economists at Barclays, have sent us their thoughts. The US ISM extended its decline, plunging from multi-year highs (above 60.0) to lows (below 48.0) in just 13 months, with the global trade slowdown largely spurring the sentiment decline. The spillovers of external demand slowdown and an associated decline in business investment are particularly evident in Europe. With manufacturing PMIs at post-GFC [global financial crisis] lows in Germany, European sentiment deteriorated further in September, touching a six-year low. We still expect domestic demand resilience to prevail over industrial recession; however, the risk that European activity could lose its remaining steam ahead of a possible no-deal Brexit in early 2020 (our baseline) looms large. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Stock markets around the globe have sold off, after US manufacturing activity fell to the lowest in more than a decade \u2013 sparking fears that the US-China trade war is affecting the US economy, just as Europe teeters on the brink of recession. The UK and European manufacturing PMIs spread further gloom, while the Chinese factory report earlier in the week also remained in contraction territory. MSCI\u2019s gauge of stocks across the globe fell 0.9%. Australian and south Korean shares have lost 1.5% and Japan\u2019s Nikkei is down 0.4%. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng slipped 0.26%, after Hong Kong police shot a teenage protester. Chinese markets are closed for a one-week holiday. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones fell 1.28% and the S&amp;P 500 lost 1.2% to hit four-week lows. Selling was triggered after the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s index of factory activity, a closely-watched survey, dropped 1.3 points to 47.8, the lowest level since June 2009. A reading below 50 indicates contraction in the manufacturing sector. The German and the UK factory readings were 41.7 and 48.3 respectively, also indicating further contraction. The French manufacturing sector barely expanded, with a reading of 50.1. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says: Looking at the broader picture, it is fair to say that the worldwide manufacturing sector is in trouble. The US-China trade spat is having a knock-on effect around the globe, hence why we saw a sharp move lower in stocks yesterday. Trade talks between the US and China will continue next week, so traders will be paying close attention to any developments. The best dealers can hope for is a de-escalation in trade tensions, but it is obvious that the damage has been done. In the UK, prime minister Boris Johnson is expected to set out his plans for the UK\u2019s departure from the EU, with the Irish border in focus. Traders are likely to be nervous as there is chatter it could be make or break for the negotiations, Madden says. The agenda 9.30am BST: UK construction PMI (September)",

There are many fine balances and complex issues involved and the decision has not been taken lightly or swiftly.\u201d</p> <p>The RSC thanked BP for its \u201cgenerous support\u201d since 2011, adding that the ticket scheme that the oil company subsidised for 16- to 25-year-olds had allowed tens of thousands of young people to see world-class performances.</p> <p>In a statement, BP said it was \u201cdisappointed and dismayed\u201d by the decision.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re disappointed that this will bring a successful programme to a premature end.

The debate centres around how to deliver this whilst meeting the world\u2019s growing energy demands \u2026 this global challenge needs everyone \u2013 companies, governments and individuals \u2013 to work together to achieve a low carbon future.\u201d</p> <p>Rylance welcomed the decision. \u201cI credit this change of heart within the RSC to the good people working there and the young people who expressed so powerfully their love for the RSC and Shakespeare and their concern for the future \u2013 a love and concern I share wholeheartedly,\u201d he said in a statement.</p> <p>\u201cNow, let us all hope that the good people within BP who are conscious of what an enormous difference BP could make in the world if it actually changed its ways and stopped blocking renewable energy, stopped investing in carbon extraction, stopped greenwashing its reputation and actually truthfully joined with the young people of Britain and lived up to their advertising as a \u2018green\u2019 company.\u201d</p> <p>BP also has ongoing sponsorship deals with the Royal Opera House, British Museum and National Portrait Gallery, which are now likely to come under further pressure from campaigners. </p> <p>Activists said it was time for all major cultural institutions to follow the RSC\u2019s lead and cut their ties with fossil fuel companies. \u201cThere is no longer any excuse for promoting a fossil fuel company in the middle of a climate crisis,\u201d said Worth.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Royal Shakespeare Company is to end its sponsorship deal with BP amid growing opposition to fossil fuel companies\u2019 sponsorship of many of the UK\u2019s leading cultural institutions. The RSC announced that after months of deliberations and a vociferous campaign from artists, the public and environmentalists, it had decided to curtail its eight-year relationship. The move will increase pressure on other cultural institutions such as the Royal Opera House, British Museum and National Portrait Gallery, which have all come under pressure over their tie-ins with fossil fuel companies. Jess Worth, the co-director of the campaign group Culture Unstained, said the decision was \u201cfantastic news\u201d that signalled the end of fossil fuel sponsorship of the arts. \u201cThe RSC has understood that a climate emergency means that business as usual cannot continue, and we congratulate them for showing leadership,\u201d she added. In a joint statement, Gregory Doran, the RSC\u2019s artistic director, and Catherine Mallyon, its executive director, said the decision had been taken after a \u201ccareful and often difficult debate\u201d internally. They added: \u201cAmidst the climate emergency, which we recognise, young people are now saying clearly to us that the BP sponsorship is putting a barrier between them and their wish to engage with the RSC. We cannot ignore that message.\u201d The sponsorship deal will conclude at the end of this year \u2013 more than two years early. There has been growing criticism of fossil fuel corporations\u2019 involvement in the arts over the past year as concern about the scale and severity of the climate crisis grows. In February, hundreds of people occupied the British Museum to object to its relationship with BP, and in June several leading artists wrote to the director of the National Portrait Gallery on the eve of its annual awards, calling on it to end its links to the company. Also in June, the Guardian revealed that Mark Rylance, who had been an associate artist with the RSC for 30 years, was resigning from his position, arguing BP\u2019s sponsorship deal allowed the company to \u201cobscure the destructive reality of its activities\u201d, which he said threatened the future of the planet. Last week, young people who had taken to the streets in huge numbers across the UK in the school climate strikes, said they would boycott the RSC unless it severed its ties with big oil. The RSC statement said the growing opposition from young people had been a critical factor in its decision. \u201cCentral to our organisational values, is that we listen to and respond to the views of young people. Each year we actively engage 500,000 children and young people with Shakespeare\u2019s plays \u2026 It is with all of this in mind that we have taken the difficult decision to conclude our partnership with BP at the end of this year. There are many fine balances and complex issues involved and the decision has not been taken lightly or swiftly.\u201d The RSC thanked BP for its \u201cgenerous support\u201d since 2011, adding that the ticket scheme that the oil company subsidised for 16- to 25-year-olds had allowed tens of thousands of young people to see world-class performances. In a statement, BP said it was \u201cdisappointed and dismayed\u201d by the decision. \u201cWe\u2019re disappointed that this will bring a successful programme to a premature end. Over the past eight years our sponsorship has enabled 80,000 young people to see RSC performances at reduced rates,\u201d it said. BP added that it was dismayed because the oil giant shared \u201cmany of the concerns that apparently contributed to the decision\u201d. \u201cWe recognise the world is on an unsustainable path and needs to transition rapidly to net-zero [emissions] in the coming decades. The debate centres around how to deliver this whilst meeting the world\u2019s growing energy demands \u2026 this global challenge needs everyone \u2013 companies, governments and individuals \u2013 to work together to achieve a low carbon future.\u201d Rylance welcomed the decision. \u201cI credit this change of heart within the RSC to the good people working there and the young people who expressed so powerfully their love for the RSC and Shakespeare and their concern for the future \u2013 a love and concern I share wholeheartedly,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cNow, let us all hope that the good people within BP who are conscious of what an enormous difference BP could make in the world if it actually changed its ways and stopped blocking renewable energy, stopped investing in carbon extraction, stopped greenwashing its reputation and actually truthfully joined with the young people of Britain and lived up to their advertising as a \u2018green\u2019 company.\u201d BP also has ongoing sponsorship deals with the Royal Opera House, British Museum and National Portrait Gallery, which are now likely to come under further pressure from campaigners. Activists said it was time for all major cultural institutions to follow the RSC\u2019s lead and cut their ties with fossil fuel companies. \u201cThere is no longer any excuse for promoting a fossil fuel company in the middle of a climate crisis,\u201d said Worth.",

Instead, Meghan is suing for breach of copyright, infringement of her privacy, and breaches of the Data Protection Act \u2013 an act beefed up last year as part of the GDPR changes. The copyright aspect of the case is based on the principle that the author of a letter retains ownership of its content, regardless of who possesses the piece of paper. \u201cA letter is a copyright work as it is a literary work,\u201d Alex Newman, national head of intellectual property law at Irwin Mitchell solicitors, said this year. \u201cAs soon as you create a copyright work you will own the copyright until it expires automatically.

Meghan\u2019s lawyers are likely to argue that there was no legitimate public interest in publishing the letter. If the MoS loses the case it could have wider implications for all journalists who want to report on leaked private documents. What is unusual about this case? Meghan has broken with protocol by employing the libel lawyers Schillings, a company which delights in its reputation as an attack dog that works aggressively on behalf of its clients against journalists. The couple have been willing to break with royal convention, hiring external PRs and refusing to agree to tabloids sharing pictures of their child. They say they will use private funds to bring the proceedings, which were announced at the end of the couple\u2019s overseas trip to South Africa, overshadowing their other announcements. What are the potential ramifications of this decision? The MoS has the same owner as its sister titles, the Daily Mail, and MailOnline, but has a separate editorial team. In common with all print newspapers its circulation is falling but its stories reach a huge audience. It is clear from Harry\u2019s statement that the real target is less a print newspaper than the dozens of websites which rewrite its stories and amplify them around the world. Starting legal proceedings against the MoS regarding a single article is also a warning to its MailOnline, which publishes dozens of stories about Meghan every month. What does this say about the couple\u2019s approach to the media? Meghan\u2019s announcement about the legal action was accompanied by a lengthy, passionate, statement from Harry expressing his anger at her treatment by the media. When his mother, Princess Diana, was the subject of intense media interest during the 1980s and 1990s there were limited ways for the royals to react against the tabloid newspapers, which sold millions of copies a day and set the national agenda. The Daily Mail pledged in the aftermath of her death to never again use paparazzi pictures. Now, social media and a broader collapse of trust in newspapers means Meghan and Harry can use the same tactics used by politicians to rally their supporters against critical media outlets.

Wednesday\u2019s closed-door hearing, the culmination of three years of investigations, arrives at an especially fraught time for Israel\u2019s longest-serving leader. Netanyahu is also fighting for his political life after failing to secure a clear win in two elections this year. Clinching the premiership for a historic fifth term is seen as a way to protect himself if indicted, as Israeli prime ministers are not required under law to step down unless they are ultimately convicted. That process could take months or even years. Political survival for Netanyahu is also potentially tied to his personal freedom as some of his parliamentary allies have suggested they would back laws to grant him immunity if he remains prime minister. Netanyahu has denied all allegations as a politically orchestrated \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d to oust him from office. However, both the attorney general, Avichai Mandelblit, and the police have already suggested indictments are likely in three cases, including multiple fraud and breach of trust charges, and a bribery charge. He could face up to 10 years in prison if convicted of bribery and a maximum three-year term for fraud and breach of trust. A team of Netanyahu\u2019s lawyers arrived at the Justice Ministry to argue that all charges should be dropped. One member, Amit Haddad, said they would present new evidence to help his client, without specifying. \u201cWe are sure that once we present our findings there will be no choice but to close the case,\u201d Haddad said before entering the hearing. \u201cWe believe and know that at the end of the day all the three cases must be closed.\u201d The first case, known as Case 1,000, involves allegations of receiving gifts, including cigars, champagne and jewellery, from billionaires, among them the Australian casino operator James Packer, allegedly in exchange for favours. In Case 2,000, Netanyahu is accused of colluding with the country\u2019s top-selling newspaper, Yedioth Ahronoth, to hurt its competition in exchange for favourable coverage. In the third and most damning, Case 4,000, Netanyahu is accused of offering incentives to the Israeli telecoms provider Bezeq in exchange for positive stories on an online news website it owns.

Suggesting that the Scottish National party was trying to drag Labour\u2019s leader, Jeremy Corbyn, unwillingly towards No 10, he cited the example of Konstantin Chernenko. He also suggested people look it up. A severely ill Chernenko was elected to succeed Yuri Andropov as head of the Soviet Union, and lasted only 13 months, during which time he could frequently not attend official functions.

He explained this was in defiance of the sceptics who had once said that \u201cwind farms couldn\u2019t pull the skin off a rice pudding\u201d. The source of that quote? One Mr B Johnson in 2013.</p> \n<p>He also cited the pioneering work of the nuclear fusion research team at Culham, Oxfordshire.

Grease a 36cm x 13cm (14in x 5in) rectangular tart tin.</p> <p>Prepare the filling. Halve the cherry tomatoes and chop the garlic into thin slivers. Place on a baking tray/roasting tin and drizzle over the olive oil and balsamic vinegar, then sprinkle on 2 big pinches of salt, and pepper to taste. Toss together a few times to combine.</p> <p>Roast for 45 minutes, checking halfway through to make sure everything is OK.</p> <p>Meanwhile, put the flour and butter in a large mixing bowl. Rub the butter into the flour using your fingertips. Add enough water to combine the pastry into a ball.</p> <p>Roll out the dough as thinly as possible on a lightly floured surface. Roll it loosely around a rolling pin, then drape it over the tart tin and press the pastry into all the edges. Trim the top of the pastry. Prick the base of the tart all over with a fork. Place in the freezer to chill for 10-15 minutes.</p> <p>When the tomatoes are ready, take them out of the oven and leave them to cool. Leave the oven on.</p> <p>Cover the tart tin with foil and fill with baking beads. Blind bake for 10 minutes with the foil on, then remove the foil and beads and bake for a further 10 minutes.</p> <p>Whisk together the eggs and double cream until just combined. Tear and add the basil leaves.</p> <p>Scatter half of the roast tomatoes over the base of the tart. Pour over the egg/cream filling and top with the rest of the tomatoes.</p> <p>Bake for 20-25 minutes, until just set (with a very, very slight wobble in the middle). Leave to cool for 10 minutes in the tart tin, then remove and transfer to a cooling rack. Top with a sprinkling of salt and pepper, a drizzle of olive oil and fresh basil leaves.</p> <p>Cut the bottom off the larger tomato so that it has a flat base, and place in a corner of the tart. Slice the removed section of tomato into two thin strips, and arrange to form arms. Cut eyes and a smile from the nori sheet, and secure on to the tomato using edible glue.<br></p> <p><em>Baking with Kim-Joy: Cute and Creative Bakes to Make You Smile is published by Quadrille.

      "bodyText": "This quiche feels fresh and will remind you of summer, thanks to its key ingredient. Once roasted, the cherry tomatoes are packed full of flavour. Makes: one rectangular tart to yield five generous portions For the pastry: 250g plain flour 135g salted butter (cubed, room temperature) 1-2 tbsp cold water For the filling: 450g cherry tomatoes 5 garlic cloves 3 tbsp olive oil 1 \u00bd tbsp balsamic vinegar Salt and pepper 2 eggs 250ml double cream A handful of basil leaves Plus: A few more basil leaves 1 larger tomato 1 nori sheet Edible glue (or similar) Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/350F/gas mark 4. Grease a 36cm x 13cm (14in x 5in) rectangular tart tin. Prepare the filling. Halve the cherry tomatoes and chop the garlic into thin slivers. Place on a baking tray/roasting tin and drizzle over the olive oil and balsamic vinegar, then sprinkle on 2 big pinches of salt, and pepper to taste. Toss together a few times to combine. Roast for 45 minutes, checking halfway through to make sure everything is OK. Meanwhile, put the flour and butter in a large mixing bowl. Rub the butter into the flour using your fingertips. Add enough water to combine the pastry into a ball. Roll out the dough as thinly as possible on a lightly floured surface. Roll it loosely around a rolling pin, then drape it over the tart tin and press the pastry into all the edges. Trim the top of the pastry. Prick the base of the tart all over with a fork. Place in the freezer to chill for 10-15 minutes. When the tomatoes are ready, take them out of the oven and leave them to cool. Leave the oven on. Cover the tart tin with foil and fill with baking beads. Blind bake for 10 minutes with the foil on, then remove the foil and beads and bake for a further 10 minutes. Whisk together the eggs and double cream until just combined. Tear and add the basil leaves. Scatter half of the roast tomatoes over the base of the tart. Pour over the egg/cream filling and top with the rest of the tomatoes. Bake for 20-25 minutes, until just set (with a very, very slight wobble in the middle). Leave to cool for 10 minutes in the tart tin, then remove and transfer to a cooling rack. Top with a sprinkling of salt and pepper, a drizzle of olive oil and fresh basil leaves. Cut the bottom off the larger tomato so that it has a flat base, and place in a corner of the tart. Slice the removed section of tomato into two thin strips, and arrange to form arms. Cut eyes and a smile from the nori sheet, and secure on to the tomato using edible glue. Baking with Kim-Joy: Cute and Creative Bakes to Make You Smile is published by Quadrille.

      "body": "<p>An NHS doctor who has lived most of her life in Britain is due to be deported and stopped from becoming a GP after making a small error in her application for a new work visa.</p> <p>Dr Mu-Chun Chiang said the Home Office\u2019s decision to remove her had left her \u201cshocked and devastated\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThey seem very keen to get rid of me. To have someone just kick you out is a pretty nasty feeling. I want to stay and train as a GP. I really enjoy working as a doctor and in the NHS.\u201d</p> <p>The Home Office based its decision to remove Chiang on her making a minor mistake in the paperwork she submitted with her application. Those seeking a tier two visa must be able to prove they have held at least \u00a3945 in their bank account for 90 consecutive days up until a month before they submit their application.</p> <p>But while Chiang had enough money in her savings account, she submitted statements relating to her current account, the balance of which dipped below \u00a3945 for some of the 90-day period.</p> <p>The Home Office initially refused to consider the evidence about her savings account when she later submitted statements and explained her mistake, because she had not included them in her original application.</p> <p>Taiwan-born Chiang, a 27-year-old trainee GP in Liverpool, has been given 14 days to leave the UK, despite working and being educated in England and Scotland for 18 years.</p> <p>She is at risk of expulsion despite the fact that Health Education England, the NHS\u2019s medical training agency, is sponsoring her and paying for the three years of her training to become a family doctor.</p> <p>The Home Office has refused to grant Chiang a tier two visa from now until 2022 to cover the duration of her GP training.</p> <p>It has banned her from working, meaning she has had to stop doing shifts in a Liverpool hospital as one of the first \u201crotations\u201d through different medical specialities as part of her training to be a GP.</p> <p>Critics claim the Home Office\u2019s treatment of Chiang is inhumane and shortsighted, given that the NHS in England is experiencing a serious and worsening shortage of GPs. It is also alleged that her deportation shows the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jun/27/home-office-windrush-report-damns-hostile-environment-policy\">\u201chostile environment\u201d approach</a> to immigration has continued, even though Theresa May \u2013 its architect \u2013 has left office.</p> <p>The Royal College of GPs criticised the decision as \u201cludicrous\u201d. It has written to Priti Patel, the home secretary, protesting against Chiang\u2019s deportation and warning patients will suffer if overseas doctors are banned from working in the NHS because of \u201cred tape or minor administrative errors\u201d.</p> <p>Chiang has been put on \u201cimmigration bail\u201d, which means she cannot study or claim benefits. She could be jailed for six months if she does not comply with her deportation, she was warned in a letter received last Friday from the Home Office.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.everydoctor.org.uk/about.html\">EveryDoctor</a>, which campaigns on issues affecting medics\u2019 working conditions, warned Chiang\u2019s deportation could deter overseas doctors from coming to work in the NHS.</p> <p>\u201cAt a time when the NHS is short of 10,000 doctors, the treatment by the Home Office towards the 81,000 doctors on visas in the UK is frankly unbelievable.</p> <p>\u201cThe NHS is actively recruiting doctors from abroad, and these doctors have uprooted themselves, and often their families too, to offer the UK their hard-earned skills. These doctors are committed to working in the NHS. The treatment these doctors are faced with is appalling,\u201d said Dr Julia Patterson, EveryDoctor\u2019s lead.</p> <p>Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: \u201cIt\u2019s ludicrous that at a time when the NHS workforce is in crisis and the skills and expertise of GPs are so desperately needed, the Home Office is still willing to deport a doctor that this country has already invested in, who has lived here for most of her life and studied medicine here.</p> <p>\u201cWe should be welcoming Dr Chiang to the NHS with open arms, not deporting her.</p> <p> \u201cUnfortunately, her case is not the first, and we suspect it is just the tip of the iceberg and that there could be many more cases where red tape or minor administrative errors are preventing our trainees and fully qualified GPs from working in the NHS when our patients and our profession are crying out for them\u201d.</p> <p>Dr Samantha Batt-Rawden, the chair of the campaign group Doctors\u2019 Association UK, criticised the handling of Chiang\u2019s case as \u201cludicrous and nonsensical\u201d. She added: \u201cTelling a young doctor to leave the country within 10 days or else face prosecution over a technicality is inhumane and shows a flagrant disregard for Dr Chiang\u2019s contribution to society and the NHS.\u201d</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Home Office, which is under mounting pressure to reverse its decision, said: \u201cWe are reconsidering Ms Chiang\u2019s application now that further evidence has been provided.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "An NHS doctor who has lived most of her life in Britain is due to be deported and stopped from becoming a GP after making a small error in her application for a new work visa. Dr Mu-Chun Chiang said the Home Office\u2019s decision to remove her had left her \u201cshocked and devastated\u201d. \u201cThey seem very keen to get rid of me. To have someone just kick you out is a pretty nasty feeling. I want to stay and train as a GP. I really enjoy working as a doctor and in the NHS.\u201d The Home Office based its decision to remove Chiang on her making a minor mistake in the paperwork she submitted with her application. Those seeking a tier two visa must be able to prove they have held at least \u00a3945 in their bank account for 90 consecutive days up until a month before they submit their application. But while Chiang had enough money in her savings account, she submitted statements relating to her current account, the balance of which dipped below \u00a3945 for some of the 90-day period. The Home Office initially refused to consider the evidence about her savings account when she later submitted statements and explained her mistake, because she had not included them in her original application. Taiwan-born Chiang, a 27-year-old trainee GP in Liverpool, has been given 14 days to leave the UK, despite working and being educated in England and Scotland for 18 years. She is at risk of expulsion despite the fact that Health Education England, the NHS\u2019s medical training agency, is sponsoring her and paying for the three years of her training to become a family doctor. The Home Office has refused to grant Chiang a tier two visa from now until 2022 to cover the duration of her GP training. It has banned her from working, meaning she has had to stop doing shifts in a Liverpool hospital as one of the first \u201crotations\u201d through different medical specialities as part of her training to be a GP. Critics claim the Home Office\u2019s treatment of Chiang is inhumane and shortsighted, given that the NHS in England is experiencing a serious and worsening shortage of GPs. It is also alleged that her deportation shows the government\u2019s \u201chostile environment\u201d approach to immigration has continued, even though Theresa May \u2013 its architect \u2013 has left office. The Royal College of GPs criticised the decision as \u201cludicrous\u201d. It has written to Priti Patel, the home secretary, protesting against Chiang\u2019s deportation and warning patients will suffer if overseas doctors are banned from working in the NHS because of \u201cred tape or minor administrative errors\u201d. Chiang has been put on \u201cimmigration bail\u201d, which means she cannot study or claim benefits. She could be jailed for six months if she does not comply with her deportation, she was warned in a letter received last Friday from the Home Office. EveryDoctor, which campaigns on issues affecting medics\u2019 working conditions, warned Chiang\u2019s deportation could deter overseas doctors from coming to work in the NHS. \u201cAt a time when the NHS is short of 10,000 doctors, the treatment by the Home Office towards the 81,000 doctors on visas in the UK is frankly unbelievable. \u201cThe NHS is actively recruiting doctors from abroad, and these doctors have uprooted themselves, and often their families too, to offer the UK their hard-earned skills. These doctors are committed to working in the NHS. The treatment these doctors are faced with is appalling,\u201d said Dr Julia Patterson, EveryDoctor\u2019s lead. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: \u201cIt\u2019s ludicrous that at a time when the NHS workforce is in crisis and the skills and expertise of GPs are so desperately needed, the Home Office is still willing to deport a doctor that this country has already invested in, who has lived here for most of her life and studied medicine here. \u201cWe should be welcoming Dr Chiang to the NHS with open arms, not deporting her. \u201cUnfortunately, her case is not the first, and we suspect it is just the tip of the iceberg and that there could be many more cases where red tape or minor administrative errors are preventing our trainees and fully qualified GPs from working in the NHS when our patients and our profession are crying out for them\u201d. Dr Samantha Batt-Rawden, the chair of the campaign group Doctors\u2019 Association UK, criticised the handling of Chiang\u2019s case as \u201cludicrous and nonsensical\u201d. She added: \u201cTelling a young doctor to leave the country within 10 days or else face prosecution over a technicality is inhumane and shows a flagrant disregard for Dr Chiang\u2019s contribution to society and the NHS.\u201d A spokeswoman for the Home Office, which is under mounting pressure to reverse its decision, said: \u201cWe are reconsidering Ms Chiang\u2019s application now that further evidence has been provided.\u201d",

No one in Little England has done more over the years than he to damage the trust placed in political leaders. Serially dishonest, a shallow opportunist who has done little good in the world except advance his own and his chums\u2019 interests. England is now the Frankie Howerd of western world. Palustrian \u2018A speech just for laughs\u2019 Good grief. We\u2019re facing the worst crisis in our lifetime and Johnson thinks it\u2019s OK to deliver his speech just for laughs.

Such a futile exercise. Such a load of nonsense. A waste. Make no mistake, however. The rhetoric is easy enough to see through. The Tories may wish to dress up their failure as being caused by the other side\u2019s intransigence, but once the dust has cleared and calm heads evaluate the route which led to Brexit, how it was managed in Britain, and its effects on Britain and the rest of Europe, the balance of shame will be squarely with the Conservatives, with leavers, and with the interests which backed this divisive, appalling venture.

We are Conservatives and we get on with serving the people \u2013 and speaking of service I should begin by paying tribute to my predecessor Theresa, I know the whole of conference remains full of gratitude to you, and to Philip May, for your patience and your forbearance, and yes, we will continue with the work of tackling domestic violence and modern slavery and building on your legacy</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Johnson begins with a dig at his predecessors, Theresa May and David Cameron, by announcing that he as prime minister is presiding over the most successful conference in years. His subsequent praise for May therefore sounds slightly flat and disingenuous \u2013 made even more awkward by her seeming absence from the audience. His pledge to carry forward her legacy on domestic violence and modern slavery suggests he only wants to continue with limited aspects of her premiership and his thanks to her husband for his \u201cpatience and forbearance\u201d also comes across as slightly insulting.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>If parliament were a laptop, then the screen would be showing the pizza wheel of doom.

But at least we could have watched the Speaker being forced to eat a kangaroo testicle. And the sad truth is that voters have more say over I\u2019m a Celebrity ... than they do over this House of Commons, which refuses to deliver Brexit, refuses to do anything constructive and refuses to have an election.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>This is populist rhetoric pure and simple from Johnson. He is whipping up anger against parliament among Brexit supporters, in effect accusing it of blocking Britain\u2019s departure from the EU. The reality is that Eurosceptics as much as opposition parties blocked May\u2019s deal, and the Conservatives have refused to pivot to a softer Brexit that could gain cross-party support. It is all part of the prime minister\u2019s framing of politics as the people versus parliament, with Johnson claiming to be on the side of the people who voted for Brexit in 2016.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>Just at the moment when voters are desperate for us to focus on their priorities, we are continuing to chew the supermasticated subject of Brexit, when what people want, what leavers want, what remainers want, what the whole world wants, is to be calmly and sensibly done with the subject and to move on, and that is why we are coming out of the EU on October 31 come what may, conference. Let\u2019s get Brexit done. We can, we must and we will, even though things have not been made easier by the surrender bill.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Johnson repeats the strapline of the Conservative conference: \u201cLet\u2019s get Brexit done.\u201d His theory is that voters are fed up with Brexit and just want it dealt with. However, the Benn act \u2013 officially called the European Union (Withdrawal) (No 2) Act 2019, which he controversially calls the \u201csurrender bill\u201d \u2013 will prevent him doing so without a Brexit deal, and he offers no suggestions for how 31 October is a realistic date for the UK\u2019s departure if an agreement with the EU cannot be reached.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>Let\u2019s get this thing done \u2013 and then let\u2019s get ready to make our case to the country against the fratricidal antisemitic Marxists who were in Brighton last week. Last week Jeremy Corbyn had a number of damaging and retrograde ideas in his speech: he wants a four-day week, which would slash the wages of people on low incomes; he wants to ban private schools and expropriate their property, even though it would cost the taxpayer \u00a37bn to educate the kids; he wants to stamp out excellence in schools by banning Ofsted, the inspectors who ensure that schools are safe for our children.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Johnson\u2019s attack lines on Labour in colourful language give a taste of the rhetoric to come in a forthcoming general election. This passage includes some misrepresentations of Labour policy already: for example, the party\u2019s four-day working week policy comes with a guarantee that there would be no loss of income.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>We have the astonishing spectacle of the leader of the opposition being prevented by his colleagues from engaging in his constitutional function, which is to try to remove me from office ... though it now appears that the SNP may yet try to bundle him towards the throne like some <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konstantin_Chernenko\">Konstantin Chernenko</a> figure, reluctantly propelled to office in a Kremlin coup, so that they get on with their programme for total national discord, turning the whole of 2020, which should be a great year for this country, into the chaos and cacophony of two more referendums: a second referendum on Scottish independence ... and a second referendum on the EU.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>This will be another theme of an election: the possibility of a Labour pact with the SNP. Johnson is at work already on the strategy that was so successful for Cameron against Ed Miliband in 2015, where English voters were repeatedly shown images of Labour in the pocket of the SNP\u2019s Nicola Sturgeon. There is also an attempt to link Labour with Russia with a relatively obscure reference to a Kremlin coup.<br></p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>Today in Brussels we are tabling what I believe are constructive and reasonable proposals, which provide a compromise for both sides. We will under no circumstances have checks at or near the border in Northern Ireland. We will respect the peace process and the Good Friday agreement. And by a process of renewable democratic consent by the executive and assembly of Northern Ireland, we will go further and protect the existing regulatory arrangements for farmers and other businesses on both sides of the border. And at the same time we will allow the UK \u2013 whole and entire \u2013 to withdraw from the EU, with control of our own trade policy from the start ... If we fail to get an agreement because of what is essentially a technical discussion of the exact nature of future customs checks, when that technology is improving the whole time. Then let us be in no doubt that the alternative is no deal.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Johnson sets out the bare bones of what he is offering the EU: the whole of the UK will withdraw from the customs union but Northern Ireland would stay in regulatory zones with Ireland for food at least and maybe other goods. Contained within it is a threat to the EU that they will get the blame if they dismiss his proposals out of hand and push the UK towards a no-deal Brexit. At this point, there is no acknowledgement of the Benn act, which forbids such an outcome.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>I am going to quote that supreme authority in my family \u2013 my mother (and by the way for keen students of the divisions in my family you might know that I have kept the ace up my sleeve \u2013 my mother voted leave). And my mother taught me to believe strongly in the equal importance, the equal dignity, the equal worth of every human being on the planet, and that may sound banal but it is not. And there is one institution that sums up that idea. The NHS is holy to the people of this country because of the simple beauty of its principle that it doesn\u2019t matter who you are or where you come from but when you are sick the whole country figuratively gathers at your bedside.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>This is the beginning of a very purple passage about the NHS, designed to overturn voters\u2019 perception that the Tories cannot be trusted with the health service. There was nothing new in terms of policy on the NHS, but he referenced plans to improve hospitals and build more over the next decade. Johnson also makes a very rare reference to his mother and family divisions over Brexit, as he is usually extremely cautious about declining to mention his personal life.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>I will tell you that it is by raising the productivity of the whole of the UK, not with socialism, not with deranged and ruinous plans borrowed from the playbook of Bolivarian revolutionary Venezuela but by creating the economic platform for dynamic free-market capitalism.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>This is another flowery section attacking Corbyn in language that sounds more like a newspaper column than a political speech. It sets the scene once again for electoral battle lines where the Conservatives will paint Labour as economically incompetent, even though most businesses and mainstream economists are scathing about Johnson\u2019s readiness to pursue a no-deal Brexit and the consequences on the country\u2019s prosperity.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>It is one of the many bizarre features of the SNP that in spite of being called names like Salmond and Sturgeon they are committed to handing back those fish to the control of the EU. We want to turbo-charge the Scottish fishing sector; they would allow Brussels to charge for our turbot.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>The speech is full of wild metaphors and vivid images but light on jokes for a Johnson event. A quip about fish probably got the biggest laugh in the hall from a very supportive crowd of MPs and activists.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p> Let\u2019s get on with sensible, moderate one-nation but tax-cutting Tory government and figuratively if not literally let us send Jeremy Corbyn into orbit where he belongs. Let\u2019s get Brexit done. Let\u2019s bring our country together.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Johnson ends with a summary of his electoral strategy - putting Brexit to bed and persuading voters that he is actually a one-nation Tory politician in spite of his hardline approach to the EU and nationalist rhetoric. His programme will be cutting taxes at the same time as promising more spending on public services \u2013 a combination of left and right wing that appears to have abandoned the fiscal restraint of the Cameron and George Osborne era. However, settling Brexit and moving on to a domestic agenda is obviously easier said than done. <br></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2017/02/annotation-enhancer\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

I am going to quote that supreme authority in my family \u2013 my mother (and by the way for keen students of the divisions in my family you might know that I have kept the ace up my sleeve \u2013 my mother voted leave). And my mother taught me to believe strongly in the equal importance, the equal dignity, the equal worth of every human being on the planet, and that may sound banal but it is not. And there is one institution that sums up that idea. The NHS is holy to the people of this country because of the simple beauty of its principle that it doesn\u2019t matter who you are or where you come from but when you are sick the whole country figuratively gathers at your bedside. This is the beginning of a very purple passage about the NHS, designed to overturn voters\u2019 perception that the Tories cannot be trusted with the health service. There was nothing new in terms of policy on the NHS, but he referenced plans to improve hospitals and build more over the next decade. Johnson also makes a very rare reference to his mother and family divisions over Brexit, as he is usually extremely cautious about declining to mention his personal life. I will tell you that it is by raising the productivity of the whole of the UK, not with socialism, not with deranged and ruinous plans borrowed from the playbook of Bolivarian revolutionary Venezuela but by creating the economic platform for dynamic free-market capitalism. This is another flowery section attacking Corbyn in language that sounds more like a newspaper column than a political speech. It sets the scene once again for electoral battle lines where the Conservatives will paint Labour as economically incompetent, even though most businesses and mainstream economists are scathing about Johnson\u2019s readiness to pursue a no-deal Brexit and the consequences on the country\u2019s prosperity. It is one of the many bizarre features of the SNP that in spite of being called names like Salmond and Sturgeon they are committed to handing back those fish to the control of the EU. We want to turbo-charge the Scottish fishing sector; they would allow Brussels to charge for our turbot. The speech is full of wild metaphors and vivid images but light on jokes for a Johnson event. A quip about fish probably got the biggest laugh in the hall from a very supportive crowd of MPs and activists. Let\u2019s get on with sensible, moderate one-nation but tax-cutting Tory government and figuratively if not literally let us send Jeremy Corbyn into orbit where he belongs. Let\u2019s get Brexit done. Let\u2019s bring our country together. Johnson ends with a summary of his electoral strategy - putting Brexit to bed and persuading voters that he is actually a one-nation Tory politician in spite of his hardline approach to the EU and nationalist rhetoric. His programme will be cutting taxes at the same time as promising more spending on public services \u2013 a combination of left and right wing that appears to have abandoned the fiscal restraint of the Cameron and George Osborne era. However, settling Brexit and moving on to a domestic agenda is obviously easier said than done.",

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s a very horrible premise to this feral ordeal from Polish writer-director Adrian Panek, a follow-up to his 2011 debut Daas, a mysterious fable about a messianic figure in 18th-century Poland. Werewolf is set at the end of the second world war. A group of teenage children are liberated by approaching Soviet forces from the Nazis\u2019 Gross-Rosen concentration camp in south-western Poland. This is the point in most stories where the nightmare might be deemed to have ended. Not here. The young people, still in their camp uniforms (they have no other clothes) are taken to a chaotically derelict, abandoned stately home in the forest, with no reliable electricity or running water, and dumped in this makeshift orphanage under the notional supervision of an embittered and distracted house mother. Food supplies are down almost to zero, marauding Soviet and Nazi soldiers are rumoured to be everywhere about, but the main horror is that the camp guard dogs are now running wild, crazed with starvation and closing in on the children\u2019s unstable fortress. It\u2019s a story with a mix of Lord of the Flies and Assault on Precinct 13. The dogs and the children have something in common: their overwhelming, unbearable hunger. The tensions between the young prisoners are accentuated and accelerated by this horrendous situation, and things are not helped by an indication that one of them might have worked out the German words of command to control the dogs. It\u2019s a disturbing, challenging drama, but one that perhaps begins to lose its narrative focus as the story proceeds. The children\u2019s faces \u2013 pinched, starved, tensed with fear, pain and urge to survive \u2013 are piercingly disturbing and real. \u2022 Werewolf is released in the UK on 4 October.",

      "bodyText": "More than 132,000 descendants of the Jews expelled from Spain in the late 15th century have applied for Spanish citizenship under a law intended to make amends for the mass exile. The law, introduced four years ago, was designed to atone for the \u201chistorical wrong\u201d that saw the country\u2019s Jewish community expelled, forced to convert to Catholicism or burned at the stake. After being extended for a year, the law lapsed on 1 October. According to the justice ministry, 132,226 people of Sephardic descent applied for Spanish citizenship before the deadline, with a huge rise in applications in the past month. \u201cBy 31 August, 60,226 applications had been received, but in September alone, almost 72,000 were received, most of them from citizens in Latin American countries, mainly Mexico, Colombia and Venezuela,\u201d the ministry said in a statement. The Spanish government had initially estimated that around 90,000 people would seek citizenship, but acknowledged that it was hard to know just how many people would meet the criteria. Spain\u2019s Federation of Jewish Communities (FCJE), which certifies applications, said it had received more than 30,000 from Mexico, 26,000 from Colombia, 14,000 from Venezuela, 7,000 from Argentina, 5,400 from the US and 4,900 from Israel. It has also dealt with applications from Panama, Ecuador, Brazil, Turkey, France, the UK, Serbia and Montenegro, Peru, Chile, Morocco and Afghanistan. Although the process does not require applicants to be practising Jews or to be resident in Spain, it is long, complicated and expensive. As well as taking tests in Spanish language and culture, applicants needed to prove their Sephardic heritage, establish or prove a special connection with Spain, and then pay a designated notary to certify their documents. Isaac Querub, the president of the FCJE, said the law had finally achieved its aims. \u201cThousands of Sephardic Jews from all over the world have recovered their Spanish nationality and thousands more are in the process of doing so,\u201d he said. \u201cSpain has used a long-lasting legal act to close a historical wound. Sephardic Jews are no longer \u2018the Jews without a homeland\u2019. Spain came to miss them and the Sephardic Jews never forgot Spain.\u201d A similar law was approved in Portugal in 2015 to atone for the expulsions from that part of the Iberian peninsula. \u201cThere is no possibility to amend what was done,\u201d the Portuguese government said at the time, adding that the law represented \u201can attribution of a right\u201d. Brexit has fuelled a huge increase in the number of applications for Portuguese citizenship. The Jewish Community of Oporto \u2013 which, along with the Lisbon Jewish community, certifies applicants \u2013 said it had received just five applications before the Brexit referendum compared with 400 in the two months following the vote. The Jewish Federation of New Mexico also recorded a spike in applications following the election of Donald Trump as president. \u201cBefore the election, we issued maybe 20 or 30 certificates,\u201d Sara Koplik, the federation\u2019s director of community outreach, told the Guardian last year. \u201cBut we have now issued 1,500 \u2013 from multiple countries.\u201d While the federation has dealt with applications from more than 50 countries, the majority come from the US, Mexico and Venezuela. \u201cIt\u2019s a big jump and of course some of it had nothing to do with the United States \u2013 it has to do with Venezuela and violence in Mexico \u2013 but for Americans, they see this as an insurance policy just in case, against hatred,\u201d said Koplik.",

The Observer thought it a little better, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/mar/30/dumbo-review-tim-burton\">Wendy Ide handing it two stars</a> but criticising the \u201covercomplicated onslaught of manufactured magic\u201d.

      "bodyText": "And with that, I\u2019ll be off to to attack my lunch with the same kind of remorseless appetite with which the All Blacks just savaged Canada. Bye! Here\u2019s a match report from Paul Rees: They came in their tens of thousands to see the one team that resonates here, New Zealand, queueing in their black jerseys in the rain more than four hours before the kick-off, a swarm so dense that stewards struggled to find space for coaches and chauffeured limousines to get through to the car park. It was chaotic, but no one went home disappointed as the holders, easing through the gears as if running in a new car, outclassed committed Canada. New Zealand secured the bonus point five minutes before half-time, but squandered four more opportunities through a mixture of dogged defending, handling errors in conditions which seemed no less humid for the roof being closed and the sloppiness that is often a by-product of mismatches. Four tries in the opening 10 minutes of the second half, including one by Scott Barrett which followed earlier scores by his brothers Beauden and Jordie, doubled the score and gave an indication of what was said at half-time, although it also felt as if someone had belatedly turned on the air-conditioning. The brothers had already become the first trio of siblings to play for New Zealand at a World Cup, and they added another record by all scoring. Much more here: Mo\u2019unga was deservedly named player of the match after an impeccable display. And here\u2019s Richie Mo\u2019unga: It was just something we\u2019ve been looking forward to. To be able to come out and throw the ball around in such an awesome environment, the atmosphere\u2019s outstanding, to play in a covered stadium meant the game could be a bit more expansive. It was a good time for us to try things, and experience a few new moves. It\u2019s good to put these things into practice. Kieran Read has a chat in the stadium: It was bloody tough in this humidity under this roof, so it was a tough game. I thought we were all quite slippery, to be honest. It\u2019s something to work on, and know you\u2019re going to get those conditions right. I think we\u2019re happy with the way we started both halves, but we also slipped off there at the ends of each half as well. Things to work on, but in these conditions its tricky. Those first 10 minutes after half-time were brutal. New Zealand didn\u2019t drop the ball or miss a chance, and Canada were blown away. \u201cWhat happened to the All Blacks at half time to inspire that whirlwind?\u201d wonders Robin Hazlehurst. \u201cDid Steve Hansen take their biscuits away? Warning to Canada, never ever let the All Blacks lose their biscuits.\u201d If you\u2019ve got no idea what he\u2019s on about, watch this: Exclusive: New Zealand are quite good. 82 mins: Phil Mack boots the ball into touch, and it\u2019s all over! 81 mins: The gong sounds, just as Jeff Hassler bursts into space! He passes to Nelson! Could they finally get their try? No! New Zealand break, and suddenly Beauden Barrett is running clear! He sprints towards the line, but three yards away the ball suddenly springs out of his hands like a crumpet from an overenthusiastic toaster! 78 mins: A lovely chip from Beauden to Jordie Barrett sets New Zealand off again, but he doesn\u2019t quite escape the Canada defence. 76 mins: Um, not like that. Kieran Read gets a hand to their lineout, taps it back to a black shirt and New Zealand escape. 76 mins: Canada have the ball inside New Zealand\u2019s half. The crowd noise picks up. Can they get on the board tonight? 73 mins: Oooof! Taylor Paris collides with Ardie Savea, head against head. The Canadian comes out of the collision worse, and is being treated. Savea, indeed, seems entirely untroubled. 71 mins: Now Brad Weber fails to collect Ben Smith\u2019s pass, when he was otherwise in for another try. I think Peter Nelson got his fingertips to it, a slight deflection that might have been decisive. 71 mins: Andrew Coe fails to collect Peter Nelson\u2019s pass, and a promising spell of Canada possession is ended. Sam Whitelock, Codie Taylor and Savea all come on. 70 mins: Ardie Savea and his goggles are about to come on. But first, a scrum. 66 mins: Mo\u2019unga, falling into the middle of a Conor Trainor-Jeff Hassler sandwich, fumbles his attempted pass to Ioane, who would otherwise have had a clear run to the line. 66 mins: Phil Mack comes on for Gordon McRorie. 64 mins: An air of near-sanity has settled over proceedings. 61 mins: A couple of changes for Canada: Conor Keys off, Mike Sheppard on; Daniel Van der Meuwe off, Taylor Paris on. 59 mins: Mo\u2019unga hasn\u2019t put a foot, or indeed a hand, wrong all day, and that\u2019s another cracker. 57 mins: From a scrum Mo\u2019unga confounds the Canadians by unexpectedly heading to his right, and then he offloads to Weber, bursting past, who sprints the last 40 yards to the line! 54 mins: Canada haven\u2019t conceded a try for over three minutes. 50 mins: Stop this madness! The outstanding Richie Mo\u2019unga completes an excellent pressured catch, Beauden Barrett slithers through a defence busily assuming the ball would continue its path from right to left, and he sprints away, draws the last defender and passes to Brad Weber! 47 mins: What a start to the half from New Zealand! This is remorseless stuff. Canada perhaps overcommit at the maul, Ioane pushes forward and lays off to Frizzell, and it\u2019s another one! 45 mins: Richie Mo\u2019unga breaks through Canada\u2019s line and passes back to Kieran Read, and he gives it to Scott Barrett, who has the most straightforward of tasks. 43 mins: A brilliant conversion from Mo\u2019unga, whose kicking has been phenomenal. 41 mins: A try within 45 seconds of the restart! It starts with Jordie Barrett brilliantly collecting Mo\u2019unga\u2019s kick, and from there they rip from right to left and Rieko Ione goes over! The players are back out, and ready for more. A change for each side: TJ Perenara is off and Brad Weber on, and Eric Howard is replaced by Howard Quattrin. For all that they lost out on a try because of a last-moment fumble, New Zealand\u2019s handling has been very good. Indeed, the number of handling errors on both sides has been more than respectable, given that it\u2019s so humid the players are essentially swimming. 41 mins: McRorie blooters the ball into touch, and the players trot off for a well-earned breather. New Zealand haven\u2019t had it all their own way, but they\u2019ve had most of it their own way. 40 mins: A fumble gives Canada the ball and a chance to clear their lines. 39 mins: Canada need half-time to happen, sharpish. McRorie clears into touch, and New Zealand have a lineout on the 20-yard line. 37 mins: Coolly done! Perenara passes to Williams, whose gentle kick sends the ball bouncing between the posts for Beauden Barrett to collect and touch down! The conversion is a formality, and that\u2019s the bonus point banked! 36 mins: The All Blacks have a lineout, about 10 yards out. One more before the break? 34 mins: Now Shannon Frizell drops the ball. New Zealand have collectively taken their eyes off it in the last quarter-hour. 32 mins: Scott Barrett bursts through Canada\u2019s defence and dives for the line, only for the ball to plop out of his hands as he moved them away from his body for the touchdown! 31 mins: Another break, while a Canadian player is treated by physios. 28 mins: Canada push forward again, but Ciaran Hearn\u2019s low kick is mopped up by Beauden Barrett. 26 mins: Canada\u2019s pressure ends with them conceding a penalty of their own, and their finest few minutes of the match have not brought a point. New Zealand take off their tight-head prop, Angus Ta\u2019avao, and bring on Nepo Laulala. 24 mins: Kieran Read concedes a penalty, and Canada kick into touch. 22 mins: Canada threaten! First McRorie and then Nelson sprint their way through the Kiwi line, into their half and to within five yards of the line, but they don\u2019t quite make it! 21 mins: A bit of a respite for Canada, as Djustice Sears-Duru gets the physio\u2019s attention for a bit. 17 mins: That\u2019s try No3! Sonny Bill Williams feints left, jinks right and steamrollers his way to the line! Mo\u2019unga does the honours with the conversion. 16 mins: And so it proves. He didn\u2019t cross the tryline, did end up in touch and Canada have the lineout. 15 mins: TJ Perenara, right on the left corner, dives over a pile of bodies in the hope of reaching the line. The referee thinks he landed short, but is checking with the TMO. 13 mins: Canada actually had the ball in the New Zealand half for a moment there, but not for long, and soon enough NZ are back on the hunt. Jordie Barrett, though, is pushed into touch - Hassler, living up to his name - before he can offload to Beauden. 10 mins: That\u2019s not an easy kick, right-footed from the far right, but Mo\u2019unga absolutely nails it. 9 mins: A great kick from Richie Mo\u2019unga in the centre finds Jordie Barrett all on his own on the right touchline, and all he has to do is catch it and touch it down. 7 mins: A Canadian has picked up the ball. 5 mins: When the scrum finally goes ahead, the All Blacks push their opponents back over the line. Kieran Read eventually breaks off the back to touch down, but he goes a moment too soon and it looked to me like Lucas Rumball might have stopped him touching down, but the referee is convinced! 4 mins: They\u2019re having all sorts of trouble setting this scrum. They\u2019ve had a couple of goes, but the referee has on each occasion told them to get up and try again. 2 mins: The All Blacks come this close to a first-minute try, but when they drive the ball over the line a Canadian hand manages to keep it off the ground. 1 min: They\u2019re off! The Kiwis keep the ball from the start, and the pressure is on. Ready to go. Beauden Barrett has the ball. Anthems sung. Haka roared. Kick-off next. Canada win the battle of the anthems. Also, lots of good facial hair. So far, they\u2019re way on top. The players are in the tunnel, and currently being drummed out! One thing I hadn\u2019t noticed before is that the drummers mime, stopping their sticks a few inches before the skin of the drums. No rain inside the stadium, mind: the roof is firmly closed, as you can see: Rain is forecast all night in Oita. This is bad news for anyone attending the game, and there\u2019s more bad news once they arrive at the stadium and have their soggy umbrellas confiscated. Still, security. Hello world! Peter Bradshaw, the Guardian\u2019s film reviewer, gave Dumbo one out of a possible five stars. \u201cTim Burton\u2019s new Dumbo lands in the multiplex big top with a dull thud,\u201d he blasted, calling it \u201ca flightless pachyderm of a film\u201d that had been \u201cpainfully de-tusked\u201d. The Observer thought it a little better, Wendy Ide handing it two stars but criticising the \u201covercomplicated onslaught of manufactured magic\u201d. It has a Rotten Tomatoes score of 47% and gets 51% on Metacritic. Dumbo is 100-1 with ye bookmakers to win the best movie Oscar this year; Canada are widely available at 150-1 to win this match. It is much more likely that one of today\u2019s liveblog readers will be struck by lightning than that Canada will win this game. Kiwi website stuff.co.nz has compiled a brief list of similar things more likely to happen than an upset in this game. History isn\u2019t very encouraging: the teams have met five times and the All Blacks have won the lot by an aggregate scoreline of 313-54. Only once \u2013 in their first meeting in October 1991, which they lost 29-13 \u2013 have Canada ended a game within 50 points of New Zealand. \u201cI have seen some of these guys run fitness tests so I know their fitness isn\u2019t necessarily going to be better than ours. I\u2019ve seen them make mistakes,\u201d says Canada\u2019s Evan Olmstead, who played for Auckland in last year\u2019s provincial championship. So, there\u2019s that I suppose. Here are today\u2019s teams: New Zealand: Beauden Barrett, Jordie Barrett, Jack Goodhue, Sonny Bill Williams, Rieko Ioane, Richie Mo\u2019unga, TJ Perenara, Kieran Read (capt), Matt Todd, Shannon Frizell, Scott Barrett, Patrick Tuipulotu, Angus Ta\u2019avao, Liam Coltman, Atu Moli. Replacements: Codie Taylor, Ofa Tuungafasi, Nepo Laulala, Sam Whitelock, Ardie Savea, Brad Weber, Ryan Crotty, Ben Smith. Canada: Patrick Parfrey, Jeff Hassler, Conor Trainor, Ciaran Hearn, DTH Van Der Merwe, Peter Nelson, Gordon McRorie, Tyler Ardron (capt), Matt Heaton, Lucas Rumball, Conor Keys, Evan Olmstead, Cole Keith, Eric Howard, Djustice Sears-Duru. Replacements: Andrew Quattrin, Hubert Buydens, Jake Ilnicki, Michael Sheppard, Josh Larsen, Phil Mack, Taylor Paris, Andrew Coe. And here is a bit of pre-match reading, in the shape of Paul Rees\u2019s match preview:",

      "bodyText": "They came in their tens of thousands to see the one team that resonates here, New Zealand, fans queueing in their black jerseys in the rain more than four hours before the kick-off, a swarm so dense that stewards struggled to find space for coaches and chauffeured limousines to get through to the car park. It was chaotic but no one went home disappointed as the holders, easing through the gears as if running in a new car, outclassed what was a committed Canada. New Zealand \u2013 who wore black armbands in memory of the former All Black Stanley \u201cTiny\u201d Hill, who died on Wednesday at the age of 92 \u2013 secured the bonus point five minutes before half-time, but squandered four more opportunities through a mixture of dogged defending, handling errors in conditions that seemed no less humid for the roof being closed and sloppiness that is often a by-product of mismatches. Four tries in the opening 10 minutes of the second half, including one by Scott Barrett following scores by his brothers Beauden and Jordie, doubled the advantage and gave an indication of what was said at half-time, although it also felt as if someone had belatedly turned on the air conditioning. The All Blacks were crisp, slick and lethal, prompted by Sonny Bill Williams, who created three in a row with a dink, a pass after drawing the defence and a lob out of the back of his hand, a kick, a flick and a trick. Canada\u2019s moment came on 21 minutes when a Richie Mo\u2019unga fumble was seized on by Gordon McRorie near the New Zealand 22. He found Lucas Rumball and the ball was moved to Peter Nelson who took on Beauden Barrett only to be hauled down just short of the line. Not conceding a try was as important to the holders as maximising their opportunities. Otherwise Canada tackled and scrambled, their narrow defence exposed at times but they threw themselves into challenges, desperate not to give anything away cheaply. The All Blacks pulled away through their own skill rather than their opponents\u2019 deficiencies, but it was hard not to feel for a team that included few front-line professionals and who tend to face the big boys mainly when a World Cup rolls around. In the four years since the 2015 tournament, Canada played three fixtures against tier-one nations: Italy at home and Ireland and Scotland away. In Japan, they have three in less than three weeks with Italy already faced and South Africa to come. Like this, international rugby makes little sense and there is no indication it will be any different come 2023. Canada kept defending, their sporadic attacks coming off turnovers. They conceded the most points of any side this tournament, but fewer than the 79 they leaked to the All Blacks in 2011. Their World Cup will be defined by their final match against Namibia, which will decide who does not finish bottom of the pool. For the All Blacks, it is all about success. It was Steve Hansen\u2019s 103rd match in charge, equalling Graham Henry\u2019s record, and the 90th time he entered a winning dressing room after a game. The danger for the All Blacks is that, with Namibia and Italy to come, their competitive edge may not be at its sharpest come the quarter-finals. It happened in 2007, when Hansen was Henry\u2019s assistant, a hard lesson absorbed. Here they were like Japan in slightly slower motion, the craft of Williams, Mo\u2019unga, Beauden Barrett, Ben Smith and Ryan Crotty supplemented by the drive of Kieran Read, Shannon Frizell and Scott Barrett.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s the thing about Bake Off in 2019. The contestants in the tent are some of the strongest the show has ever had. There is Henry, who constantly drops \u201coh what now?\u201d expressions and says things with the same level of excitement as MTV\u2019s Daria. There is Helena, who made you realise that what Bake Off actually needs is a sprinkling of death \u2013 and whose goth relationship with Noel (\u201cI\u2019ll be in my coffin if you want me\u201d) melted my heart. And there is double-entendre aficionado Michael, who said: \u201cI was definitely flirting with the bottom there. I was giving the bottom a cheeky wink,\u201d at the end of this week\u2019s episode. Yet Bake Off just feels a bit off. The feelgood factor is lacking. It has nothing to do with the bakers; it is everything else. Take the decision to have an additional baker in the tent to celebrate the show\u2019s 10th year. At first glance, it did not seem such a bad idea: another baker to fall for, an excuse to add another episode to the show\u2019s run if they wanted to. Nobody would turn that down. But instead of tweaking the format so there would be four bakers in the final instead of the usual three, they decided to go with the conventional reality show twist of threatening to drop two bakers in any given week. Then they mentioned it, constantly, as if this was Big Brother. But this is Bake Off; we watch it for respite from those sinister games. But that was nothing compared to what happened next.

However, Wednesday\u2019s bond sale was oversubscribed, allowing the bank to raise \u00a3350m, although at a steeper interest rate of 9.5%.

      "bodyText": "Flutter Entertainment, the owner of Paddy Power and Betfair, is to buy The Stars Group (TSG), which owns Sky Bet, in a \u00a310bn deal which will create the world\u2019s largest online betting company by revenue. The deal, agreed with one eye on the new and rapidly expanding US market for sports betting, will give Flutter shareholders a 55% majority of an online gaming group that would have had combined revenues of \u00a33.8bn last year. Investors gave their immediate approval to the all-share takeover, which is expected to create \u00a3140m of cost savings per year, sending shares in Flutter up by 20% to \u00a391.96. It will involve a commercial tie-up with the US broadcaster Fox Sports, run by Rupert Murdoch\u2019s son Lachlan, which is already the US betting partner for the Canadian-based TSG. Fox Sports will gain the right to acquire 18.5% of Flutter\u2019s US fantasy sports business FanDuel at market value from 2021. Flutter bought FanDuel last year as it sought to establish a US bulkhead in the wake of the supreme court\u2019s decision to legalise sports betting, a ruling that triggered a race between UK bookmakers to enter the lucrative new market. Peter Jackson, the chief executive of Flutter, will lead a combined business serving 4 million gamblers in 100 markets. He said the takeover would \u201cturbocharge\u201d the company\u2019s strategy of expansion into new markets while retaining a leading position where it is already well established, in the UK, Ireland and Australia. \u201cWe believe the combination of Flutter and TSG will deliver substantial value for shareholders,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will have an exceptional portfolio of leading recreational brands and best-in-class products on industry-leading technology platforms.\u201d Flutter\u2019s chairman, Gary McGann, said the combined group would also be a \u201cstrong voice in the promotion of responsible gambling worldwide\u201d. In its previous incarnation as Paddy Power Betfair, Flutter agreed a \u00a32.2m penalty for responsible gambling failures last year, a settlement that relates in part to an ongoing legal battle with the victim of an alleged theft by a problem gambler. It was one of the few UK high street bookmakers to support the government\u2019s reduction in stakes on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) from \u00a3100 to \u00a32. It was accused of trying to bypass the restriction after a Guardian investigation found it had developed a game that mimicked the roulette-style machines while technically abiding by FOBT curbs. It was eventually forced to withdraw the game by the Gambling Commission. Analysts said the takeover of TSG would soup up Flutter\u2019s efforts to conquer the US and could signal fresh consolidation in a sector that has already witnessed a succession of mergers. \u201cThis will enable Flutter to capitalise upon the relaxation of American laws on sports betting, which is now legal in 11 states, with seven more primed to announced a launch date,\u201d said Russ Mould, the investment director at stockbroker AJ Bell. \u201cIt will also enable the company to diversify further beyond the British and Australian markets, where it is the leader in online punting.

Johnson attacked parliament for seeking to block Brexit, repeatedly praised the NHS and warned the EU27 that he was determined to take Britain out of the EU on 31 October. Giving his first speech to the Conservative party faithful as prime minister, Johnson confirmed the outline of his Brexit plan, key elements of which had been leaked overnight. And despite the Benn act, which is aimed at forcing him to request a Brexit delay if he cannot secure a deal, he insisted the only alternative was a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. \u201cThat is not an outcome we want, it is not an outcome we seek at all \u2013 but let me tell you, my friends, it is an outcome for which we are ready.\u201d He then asked the packed hall in Manchester: \u201cAre we ready for it?\u201d and the audience shouted back: \u201cYes, we are.\u201d The prime minister said he would offer to keep Northern Ireland aligned with EU rules initially, and then give the Northern Ireland executive and assembly a veto over what happened next. \u201cWe will under no circumstances have checks at or near the border in Northern Ireland.

It is like a short story that insouciantly signs off before you\u2019ve quite decided what it means.</p> <p>Grace Van Patten plays Lilian, a young woman who has amicably, or at any rate affectlessly, broken up with her boyfriend, Nate (Gary Richardson). Her wealthy widower dad is currently upsetting Lilian by disporting himself in Paris with a new French girlfriend and not returning her phone messages. But it is this absentee dad who fixes Lilian up with a temporary place to stay \u2013 at the handsome home of a family friend: the legendary, reclusive novelist Julia Price (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/emily-mortimer\" title=\"\">Emily Mortimer</a>), the author of a cult classic called Good Posture.</p> <p>Bizarrely, the difficult and prickly Price takes a sort-of shine to Lilian and starts coming into her bedroom and writing messages in Lilian\u2019s private journal while she is out. And then Lilian meets Nate in the street, and, mortified by the fact that he already has a new partner, she says the first status-boosting lie that comes into her head: that she is making a documentary about Julia Price, and now she has to go through with it.</p> <p>There is much comedy to be had from the eccentric director of photography that Lilian appoints; he is wittily played by John Early. And Wells has landed droll cameos from literary stars playing themselves, being interviewed on the importance of this (fictional) novelist: Zadie Smith, Jonathan Ames and even a ruminative, vaping Martin Amis. A stylish diversion.</p> <p>\u2022 Good Posture is released in the UK on 4 October.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oePXZdY75o\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0oePXZdY75o?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>",

      "bodyText": "Actor turned writer-director Dolly Wells makes her feature debut with this slight, elegant, lo-fi indie comedy, a tale of self-doubting but privileged cultured/artistic twentysomethings in Brooklyn, New York, which unrolls in the manner of Noah Baumbach or Lena Dunham. Wells\u2019s coolly indirect way with dialogue prevents the movie becoming insufferable in the way that it might have done in other hands. It is like a short story that insouciantly signs off before you\u2019ve quite decided what it means. Grace Van Patten plays Lilian, a young woman who has amicably, or at any rate affectlessly, broken up with her boyfriend, Nate (Gary Richardson). Her wealthy widower dad is currently upsetting Lilian by disporting himself in Paris with a new French girlfriend and not returning her phone messages. But it is this absentee dad who fixes Lilian up with a temporary place to stay \u2013 at the handsome home of a family friend: the legendary, reclusive novelist Julia Price (Emily Mortimer), the author of a cult classic called Good Posture. Bizarrely, the difficult and prickly Price takes a sort-of shine to Lilian and starts coming into her bedroom and writing messages in Lilian\u2019s private journal while she is out. And then Lilian meets Nate in the street, and, mortified by the fact that he already has a new partner, she says the first status-boosting lie that comes into her head: that she is making a documentary about Julia Price, and now she has to go through with it. There is much comedy to be had from the eccentric director of photography that Lilian appoints; he is wittily played by John Early. And Wells has landed droll cameos from literary stars playing themselves, being interviewed on the importance of this (fictional) novelist: Zadie Smith, Jonathan Ames and even a ruminative, vaping Martin Amis. A stylish diversion. \u2022 Good Posture is released in the UK on 4 October.",

It is a world of bandit trawlers, pirates, enslaved crews, brutality and neglect, afflicted by all the worst cruelties of life on dry land, without the redeeming hope of justice. Although the killings were witnessed by a significant number of crew members of several boats, they were not reported, and Urbina says there was not even a requirement to do so under maritime law.</p> <p>The \u201cunfortunate truth\u201d is that \u201cin much of the maritime world the law protects a ship\u2019s cargo better than its crew\u201d, he writes, tracing this all-embracing callousness back to English common law, rooted in an era of tall masted sailing ships when death at sea was viewed an act of God. In theory, the laws on board a ship are those of the nation whose flag it flies and there is a patchwork of maritime laws for the high seas. But it soon becomes evident that what laws there may be are almost never enforced.

The victims turn out to be young Pakistani fishermen who came too close to Taiwanese-owned tuna ships in the Indian Ocean in August 2012. The motive for the murders is never entirely clear. The tuna ship skippers declare the Pakistanis to be pirates and have their boat rammed and the crew executed in the water. But they would have seen their victims were unarmed. Urbina speculates that the Pakistanis were killed because they were considered to be competition. At the time of the book going to print, there has been no sign of justice for the murders. One of the tuna boats involved eventually sinks, quite possibly scuttled to destroy evidence, but no one is convicted. For Urbina, it is not the inhumanity of the incident that is remarkable, but the fluke of the evidence left on the phone.</p> <p>Captains of outlaw ships inflict capital punishment and fishermen frequently kill each other in brawls. Impunity is the dominant theme of this book. The high seas are crisscrossed by vessels operating outside the law \u2013 fishing in another country\u2019s territorial waters, with crews trapped in debt to the owners or intermediaries. They are unable to jump ship or complain about the appalling conditions and lack of safety.

Trump administration draws battle lines with Congress The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, on Tuesday dismissed summons from House Democratic committee chairmen for five current and former state department officials to testify about the Trump-Ukraine scandal amid an escalating impeachment inquiry. Yet despite Pompeo\u2019s claim that Democrats were trying \u201cto intimidate, bully, and treat improperly\u201d the officials, at least three have signalled their willingness to testify. Pompeo has only limited power to stop the congressional committees from gathering evidence for an impeachment inquiry. International developments. The attorney general, William Barr, met UK intelligence officials and discussed enlisting their help in discrediting the Mueller inquiry, it has emerged, while a prosecutor in Ukraine who fed information about the Biden family to Rudy Giuliani is being investigated for alleged ties to underground gambling. Trump allies divided. Washington Republicans have so far failed to present a coherent defence against impeachment, says Tom McCarthy, while infighting over the scandal at the president\u2019s favourite news network has spilled on to the screen. Khashoggi murder still roiling the Middle East, one year on A year since the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi assassins at the country\u2019s consulate in Istanbul, the fallout from the killing continues to vex the entire region, as the Guardian\u2019s Middle East correspondent, Martin Chulov, explains. Before Khashoggi\u2019s death last October, the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, was starting to overcome his country\u2019s doubters with a programme of reform. Today, he is isolated and weakened, and his relationship to the Trump administration under scrutiny. No justice. Despite the outsized political impact of his death, Khashoggi\u2019s fiancee, Hatice Cengiz, says the Trump administration and the international community have still taken no direct action to bring his killers to justice. Former Dallas cop guilty of murdering Botham Jean at home There were chants of \u201cblack lives matter\u201d in a Dallas courtroom on Tuesday, as a white former police officer was found guilty of murdering her black neighbour at his home last September after confusing his apartment for her own. Amber Guyger argued that she had a right to use lethal force when she shot dead Botham Jean, believing the innocent 26-year-old was an intruder in her home \u2013 only to later realise she had entered his property by mistake. Held accountable. Guyger is the first Dallas police officer to be convicted of murder since the 1970s. The guilty verdict was hailed by the Jean family\u2019s lawyer as \u201ca victory for black people\u201d and a signal that \u201cpolice officers are going to be held accountable for their actions.\u201d. Anti-terror centre helped police track environmental activists A federally sponsored anti-terrorism centre in Oregon helped a taskforce that was monitoring environmental protest groups in the state, according to documents obtained by the Guardian. The Oregon Titan Fusion Center, part of a national network established to monitor terrorist activities after 9/11, shared information with the South-western Oregon Joint Task Force, which was surveilling opponents of the $10bn Jordan Cove energy project. The ACLU and other observers argue that such activities break Oregon law. State cooperation. The leaders of 45 international, national and Oregon-based environmental groups have written to the state\u2019s governor, Kate Brown, urging her to withdraw state cooperation from any such surveillance of activists. Cheat sheet Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, has taken the rare step for a royal of suing the publisher of the Mail on Sunday newspaper for publishing a private letter she wrote to her father, as Prince Harry launched a scathing personal attack on the UK\u2019s tabloid press. Trump suggested shooting migrants in the legs, electrifying the Mexican border wall and fortifying it with spikes, and even digging a moat filled with snakes or alligators to deter migrants, according to a new book excerpted by the New York Times. Politicians in Syria\u2019s Kurdish-led north-east have demanded western assistance to help de-radicalise the region, by establishing a war crimes tribunal for the foreign Isis fighters still being held there in overcrowded prisons and refugee camps. Boris Johnson is expected to make his \u201cfinal\u201d Brexit offer to the EU in a speech at the UK Conservative party\u2019s annual conference on Tuesday, including a customs border in Ireland \u2013 a plan already rejected by Dublin and other European capitals. Must-reads Warren rises, but still needs African-American votes Elizabeth Warren has pulled away from the Democratic pack, leading Joe Biden in key primary states and even some national polls. But she still has work to do if she wants to wrest African-American support from the former vice president, as Lauren Gambino reports. Growing up in America\u2019s murder capital In a city where 13 black children were killed with guns this summer alone, being close to home and family is still no guarantee of safety. Lauren Aratani reports from St Louis on what it\u2019s like to grow up \u2013 and to raise children \u2013 in the country\u2019s murder capital. Migrant workers killed by heat in Qatar As construction ramps up ahead of the 2022 World Cup, the Guardian has found that hundreds of migrant labourers are dying of heat stress every year, after being forced to work in searing temperatures. Pete Pattison spoke to the family and co-workers of one such victim, 24-year-old Rupchandra Rumba. The opioids \u2018cartel\u2019 in a small West Virginia town The epicentre of America\u2019s opioids epidemic might just have been Mingo County, an otherwise quiet, rural region of West Virginia. Chris McGreal learns how the tiny town of Williamson was home to what police call a \u201ccartel\u201d of doctors, pharmacists and drug firms. Opinion The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, was dragged into the Trump impeachment scandal after visiting Washington last week. But Australians seem to think a strong relationship with the US remains more important than who is in the White House, says pollster Peter Lewis. While just one-third of Australians believe the Trump presidency has been good for Australia, that does not mean that a good relationship with Morrison reflects poorly on him. Sport Mauricio Pochettino has admitted his Tottenham team \u201cgave up a little bit\u201d in the second half of a brutal 2-7 home defeat to Bayern Munich on Tuesday night, with the former Arsenal winger Serge Gnabry scoring four to compound the humiliation. Elsewhere in the Champions League, Manchester City beat Dinamo Zagreb while PSG and Juventus topped their respective groups. Young cyclists in Colombia risk life and limb by racing downhill on customised bikes at speeds of up to 77mph, a sport known as gravity biking. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of life for anyone who lives up in the communes,\u201d one teenage competitor tells Joe Parkin Daniels in Medell\u00edn.

      "body": "<p>You may not know his face or name, but if you\u2019ve visited Rome recently, chances are you may have seen his work.</p> <p>Sculptor Andrea Gandini, 22, is transforming tree stumps around the city by carving faces into them. In the last four years he has made 65 such sculptures in the capital as part of his <em>Troncomorto</em> (\u201cdead trunk\u201d) project, documenting his creations on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/gandini.andrea/?hl=en\">his Instagram account</a>.</p> <p>Gandini chose to carve faces because he believes they help elicit empathy and respect from passersby towards the tree stumps. \u201cThey respect the tree is also an individual,\u201d he says. He tries to imagine what kind of face the tree would have if it was a person: \u201cI try to find a face that\u2019s right for that particular tree.\u201d</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/20/ringleader-mafia-style-gang-rome-jailed-massimo-carminati\">lack of upkeep</a> means the city\u2019s streets have many diseased trees. \u201cThere was a big gap of five to 10 years where the trees were not taken care of properly,\u201d says Gandini. \u201cSo there are a lot of ill trees that have to be cut down because no one took care of them. The city now has a lot of tree stumps.\u201d</p> <p>Not everyone appreciates his work, however. Recently he says he was about to start carving a stump near the Colosseum when police stopped him, citing a new law that is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/07/rome-clamps-down-on-tourists-uncouth-behaviour\">tackling illegal street trading outside tourist sights</a>. They threatened to ban him from the area for a year if they catch him there again. Nevertheless, he is undeterred: \u201cThey\u2019re dead trees, so they\u2019re not the property of the city. I have the moral right to do it.\u201d</p> <p>Gandini has created a map on his <a href=\"http://andreagandini.art/\">website</a> with the locations of the sculptures. Tour guides have started to include them on street art tours.</p> <p><em>Guardian Cities brings together the best in urban photography on Instagram at <a href=\"https://instagram.com/guardiancities/\">@guardiancities</a>.

      "bodyText": "You may not know his face or name, but if you\u2019ve visited Rome recently, chances are you may have seen his work. Sculptor Andrea Gandini, 22, is transforming tree stumps around the city by carving faces into them. In the last four years he has made 65 such sculptures in the capital as part of his Troncomorto (\u201cdead trunk\u201d) project, documenting his creations on his Instagram account. Gandini chose to carve faces because he believes they help elicit empathy and respect from passersby towards the tree stumps. \u201cThey respect the tree is also an individual,\u201d he says. He tries to imagine what kind of face the tree would have if it was a person: \u201cI try to find a face that\u2019s right for that particular tree.\u201d A lack of upkeep means the city\u2019s streets have many diseased trees. \u201cThere was a big gap of five to 10 years where the trees were not taken care of properly,\u201d says Gandini. \u201cSo there are a lot of ill trees that have to be cut down because no one took care of them. The city now has a lot of tree stumps.\u201d Not everyone appreciates his work, however. Recently he says he was about to start carving a stump near the Colosseum when police stopped him, citing a new law that is tackling illegal street trading outside tourist sights. They threatened to ban him from the area for a year if they catch him there again. Nevertheless, he is undeterred: \u201cThey\u2019re dead trees, so they\u2019re not the property of the city. I have the moral right to do it.\u201d Gandini has created a map on his website with the locations of the sculptures. Tour guides have started to include them on street art tours.

      "body": "<p>Strong signals that a slowdown in global manufacturing intensified in September sent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/live/2019/oct/02/manufacturing-slump-heightens-global-economic-gloom-business-live\">stock markets tumbling</a> on Wednesday, as leading indices in Europe and the US retreated.</p> <p>In London the FTSE 100 rolled back all the gains made since mid-August as it dropped 237 points to 7,122, falling 3.2% in its biggest one-day fall since 2016. Extending the losses overnight on Asian markets, shares on continental European markets also experienced losses with the Paris CAC falling 3.1% to 5,422. The Dow Jones index in New York compounded its decline on Tuesday by falling close to 500 points on Wednesday, or 1.86%.</p> <p>The trigger for the declines came from the latest batch of surveys to show manufacturers responding to a sharp fall in orders by cutting back production and jobs. </p> <p>That fall appears to be contributing to slowdown in hiring. ADP, the US\u2019s largest payroll supplier, said the US had added 135,000 new jobs in September. The three-month average is now 145,000 a month, down from 214,000 a year ago. The US government releases its latest job report on Friday and bad news could lead to further sell-offs.</p> <p>On Tuesday, the country\u2019s manufacturers reported the biggest contraction in September since the end of the 2009 recession, reflecting a slowdown in the US and global economies made worse by the tit-for-tat trade war with China.</p> <p>Marking the lowest level of activity since June 2009, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its <a href=\"https://www.instituteforsupplymanagement.org/ISMReport/MfgROB.cfm\">manufacturing index fell to 47.8% last month</a> from 49.1%. Of the 18 subcategories used by the ISM, only three reported growth in September.</p> <p>The news followed surveys across Europe that showed manufacturers have reduced the number of shifts and workers\u2019 hours.</p> <p>UK factory output <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/01/uk-manufacturers-start-stockpiling-for-no-deal-brexit-again\">fell in September for the fifth</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/01/uk-manufacturers-start-stockpiling-for-no-deal-brexit-again\"> month in a row</a> to register the longest downturn since 2009, according to data released on Tuesday, despite a boost from firms stockpiling goods and materials to cope with a no-deal Brexit and the likelihood of border delays. The IHS Markit/Cips manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) increased slightly to 48.3 from a six-and-a-half-year low of 47.4 in August, but remaining below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.</p> <p>Investors were also spooked by forecasts from Refinitiv that showed companies across Europe were poised to report their worst quarterly earnings since the first quarter of 2018, mostly in response to uncertainty surrounding the UK\u2019s Brexit negotiations with Brussels.</p> <p>According to the data firm, companies featured on the Euro Stoxx 600 list are likely to post a 2.2% drop in third-quarter earnings per share (EPS) \u2013 a key indicator of a company\u2019s financial prospects. EPS measures how much a company has generated in profit and can allocate to dividend payments.</p> <p>A survey of UK construction on Wednesday only added to the gloom as builders in the commercial sector joined civil engineers and house builders in cutting back on new work.</p> <p>IHS Markit said construction companies were mothballing projects while they waited for the outcome of Brexit negotiations, pushing the industry index down to 43.3 in September, from 45 in August. Currency traders reacted by sending the pound down to $1.22, 0.6% lower and back towards the $1.20 mark last seen in August.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/01/wto-warns-tariff-wars-threaten-jobs-and-global-living-standards\">The World Trade Organi</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/01/wto-warns-tariff-wars-threaten-jobs-and-global-living-standards\">zation said the manufacturing slowdown</a> was closely aligned with the continuing spat between the US and China over import tariffs that had dragged on for more than 18 months.</p> <p>It warned that the outbreak of tariff wars posed a threat to jobs and living standards as it slashed its forecast for trade growth during 2019.</p> <p>The Geneva-based WTO said it had more than halved its <a href=\"https://www.wto.org/english/news_e/pres19_e/pr840_e.htm\">growth forecast for trade in goods</a> this year from 2.6% to 1.2% after a summer of escalating US-China protectionism, a slowdown in global growth and fears of the impact of a no-deal Brexit.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Strong signals that a slowdown in global manufacturing intensified in September sent stock markets tumbling on Wednesday, as leading indices in Europe and the US retreated. In London the FTSE 100 rolled back all the gains made since mid-August as it dropped 237 points to 7,122, falling 3.2% in its biggest one-day fall since 2016. Extending the losses overnight on Asian markets, shares on continental European markets also experienced losses with the Paris CAC falling 3.1% to 5,422. The Dow Jones index in New York compounded its decline on Tuesday by falling close to 500 points on Wednesday, or 1.86%. The trigger for the declines came from the latest batch of surveys to show manufacturers responding to a sharp fall in orders by cutting back production and jobs. That fall appears to be contributing to slowdown in hiring. ADP, the US\u2019s largest payroll supplier, said the US had added 135,000 new jobs in September. The three-month average is now 145,000 a month, down from 214,000 a year ago. The US government releases its latest job report on Friday and bad news could lead to further sell-offs. On Tuesday, the country\u2019s manufacturers reported the biggest contraction in September since the end of the 2009 recession, reflecting a slowdown in the US and global economies made worse by the tit-for-tat trade war with China. Marking the lowest level of activity since June 2009, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its manufacturing index fell to 47.8% last month from 49.1%. Of the 18 subcategories used by the ISM, only three reported growth in September. The news followed surveys across Europe that showed manufacturers have reduced the number of shifts and workers\u2019 hours. UK factory output fell in September for the fifth month in a row to register the longest downturn since 2009, according to data released on Tuesday, despite a boost from firms stockpiling goods and materials to cope with a no-deal Brexit and the likelihood of border delays. The IHS Markit/Cips manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) increased slightly to 48.3 from a six-and-a-half-year low of 47.4 in August, but remaining below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction. Investors were also spooked by forecasts from Refinitiv that showed companies across Europe were poised to report their worst quarterly earnings since the first quarter of 2018, mostly in response to uncertainty surrounding the UK\u2019s Brexit negotiations with Brussels. According to the data firm, companies featured on the Euro Stoxx 600 list are likely to post a 2.2% drop in third-quarter earnings per share (EPS) \u2013 a key indicator of a company\u2019s financial prospects. EPS measures how much a company has generated in profit and can allocate to dividend payments. A survey of UK construction on Wednesday only added to the gloom as builders in the commercial sector joined civil engineers and house builders in cutting back on new work. IHS Markit said construction companies were mothballing projects while they waited for the outcome of Brexit negotiations, pushing the industry index down to 43.3 in September, from 45 in August. Currency traders reacted by sending the pound down to $1.22, 0.6% lower and back towards the $1.20 mark last seen in August. The World Trade Organization said the manufacturing slowdown was closely aligned with the continuing spat between the US and China over import tariffs that had dragged on for more than 18 months. It warned that the outbreak of tariff wars posed a threat to jobs and living standards as it slashed its forecast for trade growth during 2019. The Geneva-based WTO said it had more than halved its growth forecast for trade in goods this year from 2.6% to 1.2% after a summer of escalating US-China protectionism, a slowdown in global growth and fears of the impact of a no-deal Brexit.",

      "bodyText": "Time to sign off now, so I\u2019ll leave you with Andy Bull\u2019s match report from Fukuoka. There\u2019s another match coming up, and it\u2019s a decent bet for the pool stage\u2019s biggest blowout. Join Simon Burnton for New Zealand v Canada: We\u2019ll all look back and laugh when France end up in the final. Lopez adds the conversion, and France have won by 24 points, despite playing like a drain for a good hour. A rolling maul gets the jump on a tired US pack, and Jefferson Poirot cracks the case, finding the gap and diving over the line. 78 mins: France 26-9 USA Will Magie replaces MacGinty, who is a contender for man of the match. There aren\u2019t too many out there, in fairness. 77 mins: France 26-9 USA France are showing little interest in getting forward now the bonus point is safe. They\u2019ve had two gears today: third and reverse. 76 mins: France 26-9 USA Olive Kilifi and Thretton Palamo - a couple of magnificent names - off the bench for the USA. For France, Romain Ntamack replaces Guitoune. 74 mins: France 26-9 USA Replamcent Greg Peterson breaks through a couple of tackles as the US keep threatening. It\u2019s been a rough seven minutes since MacGinty brought them within three points. France turn the ball over quickly, and Lopez picks out Raka with a crossfield pass. The wing is hit with a high tackle, but dusts himself off and keeps going. The ball is worked to Baptiste Serin, who bursts through the defence and trundles in under the posts. Lopez converts, and France have their bonus point! 69 mins: France 19-9 USA France need one more score to lock down a bonus point. Lopez took that kick quickly, and they\u2019re on the charge again from the kick-off ... France have bodies on the overlap, but don\u2019t need too many of them, with Gael Fickou crashing over close to the posts. Lopez adds the conversion, and France may have just got out of jail! 66 mins: France 12-9 USA France urgently step on the gas, working through the phases, keeping their concentration with Alldritt at the heart of things ... 65 mins: France 12-9 USA Well, well. Is the Fukuoka Fairytale really on here? More French changes, with Gregory Alldritt and Baptiste Serin coming on. After a quick consultation, MacGinty decides to kick for goal. It\u2019s 30m out, left of the posts but eminently kickable. And he nails it! The gap is down to three points! 61 mins: France 12-6 USA De Haas collects Lopez\u2019s kick in midfield, before MacGinty pounces on a Raka handling error, his kick through forcing a penalty ... 60 mins: France 12-6 USA Twenty minutes to go. Since Yoann Huget\u2019s converted try five minutes in, France have been outscored 6-5. 58 mins: France 12-6 USA Changes: Medard and Vahaamahina are on for France, Paul Mullen and Ben Pinkelman for the USA. 56 mins: France 12-6 USA After reeling in that pass, Raka exchanged words with an American player - Scully, I think - and raised a hand to his face. A bit daft, and a sign of growing French frustration. 54 mins: France 12-6 USA The USA turn over again, Mike Teo stealing in. They push forward, MacGinty chipping towards the corner, where Raka collects under moderate pressure. 52 mins: France 12-6 USA When France move through the gears like that, you wonder what on earth they\u2019re playing at the rest of the time. For the USA, Ruben De Haas replaces Shaun Davies. 50 mins: France 12-6 USA France really should have scored here. Sofiane Guitoune relocates the USA\u2019s soft centre and swings a high pass towards Raka - but it swirls in the wind and drifts forward! 48 mins: France 12-6 USA MacGinty makes a rare error of judgement, trying an optimistic kick with better options available. Lopez fields it comfortably. 47 mins: France 12-6 USA A nice passage of flowing rugby from both sides, with Fickou threatening to break away down the right and Scully retaliating, only to be denied by an unfortunate knock-on off Mike Teo. 45 mins: France 12-6 USA Another front-row change for France, with Cyril Baille making way for Jefferson Poirot. Can he solve France\u2019s problems? 44 mins: France 12-6 USA France come again, Setiano crashing through challenges before Picamoles is penalised again. That one may have been a little harsh, but the USA survive again. 42 mins: France 12-6 USA The French pack start rolling ominously towards the try line - but the USA turn it over, the excellent Taufetee doing the damage. MacGinty just about gets it clear ... The second half is under way. For France, Guilhem Guirado is off the bench, replacing Camille Chat. Presumably, he\u2019ll also resume captaincy duties. Half-time thoughts: Holy hell, these ads are loud. Half-time reading: From a US scrum, MacGinty jinks forward, but is stripped of the ball. The gong sounds for half time and France swiftly hoof it out. They lead, but it\u2019s been far from comfortable. 39 mins: France 12-6 USA Another French attack runs out of steam, with the USA forcing a penalty - the eighth committed by France in this half. 37 mins: France 12-6 USA With the setting sun twinkling through the stand, France try to build forward momentum - but the ball is turned over. The USA are turning this into a bit of a scrap, which will be to their advantage. 35 mins: France 12-6 USA The underdogs are on top in terms of possession and territory so far - if not on the scoreboard. 33 mins: France 12-6 USA Picamoles was penalised again there - different offence, and a while since his first warning, so no yellow card. The USA might feel a little aggrieved. Picamoles penalised, MacGinty tries to kick through from the advantage, but can\u2019t find a teammate. The fly-half settles for the three points. 30 mins: France 12-3 USA They win the scrum and pour forward, Iosefo again leading the charge. The forwards get involved, and the wall of white edges to within five metres ... 28 mins: France 12-3 USA Lopez, who has delivered two clinical kicks to give France some breathing space, is held up by Iosefo and Campbell, and eventually penalised. The USA will have a scrum in French territory ... Picamoles carves out space for Lopez, who delivers an inch-perfect diagonal kick out to the right flank. Alivereti Raka cruises down the touchline, takes it cleanly and scores. They made that look easy; it wasn\u2019t. Ramos can\u2019t add the conversion from a narrow angle. 23 mins: France 7-3 USA France haven\u2019t had it all their own way, but they\u2019re looking to test their opponents\u2019 defence again here. It\u2019s painstaking progress, but they creep into the US 22 ... 22 mins: France 7-3 USA Another stop-start scrum offers plenty of fun for the casual rugby fan. Two French players are required to stop Taufetee, but France are penalised for offside. MacGinty takes the chance to get the underdogs on the board, tucking away the kick. 18 mins: Fry and co get some joy at the scrum, France penalised for collapsing the scrum, and MacGinty kicks towards the corner. The USA stay on the front foot, hooker Joe Taufetee powering to within 10 metres ... 17 mins: A midfield scrum, and an opportunity to inform you that US prop Eric Fry plays his club rugby in France for Vannes - where he\u2019s even learnt a little Breton. 16 mins: That ball already looks mighty slippery, with US skipper Blaine Scully the latest to feel it squirming from his grasp. 14 mins: France 7-0 USA The US have threatened, but still look shaky in defence. A routine kick through finds a large hole that three or four blue shirts pour through, but nobody can get hands on the ball, Picamoles knocking on, much to his frustration. 11 mins: France 7-0 USA France concede a penalty, and from a lineout, USA drive for the line. Picamoles is penalised for collapsing the maul - the referee thought about a yellow card, but settled for a warning. France are penned back, but turn it over and Machenaud clears. 9 mins: France 7-0 USA The American fans in the stands were left deflated by that score, but their team are fighting back, sevens star Iosefo again breaking down the left wing ... They break forward at pace, Ramos kickstarting a flowing move with a sidestep before Lopez kicks through and Yoann Huget shows great hands to collect and cross over. A fine start for France, with Ramos adding the conversion. 5 mins: After a lengthy scrum tussle, Iosefo tries a chip and charge down the touchline, but France collect and come again ... 2 mins: France almost make an immediate impact, Lopez breaking a tackle and offloading to Fickou, who is denied by Marcel Brache. AJ MacGinty kicks clear tidily under pressure. Here we go, then. Plenty of chat in the ITV studio that we could perhaps see an upset here. Seems like a stretch, but let\u2019s find out. There\u2019s a moment of silence to honour Jacques Chirac, the former president of France who died last week. Then it\u2019s time for the anthems. The players are heading onto the field in Fukuoka. Part of the turf has been relaid here after cutting up badly during Italy\u2019s win over Canada here. Throw in blustery, wet weather and you\u2019ve got yourself some testing conditions. For the USA, Will Hooley is absent after taking two big hits against England, and being stretchered off. In his guest column, Hooley is remarkably sanguine about the whole business, and looks forward to returning later in the tournament: France suffered an embarrassing moment in the buildup to this game, after calling Uini Antonio into the squad. Soon after announcing the La Rochelle prop\u2019s inclusion, they had to backtrack after discovering he had been injured in a match on Saturday, and was out for three months. Zut alors! France: Ramos, Raka, Guitoune, Fickou, Huget, Lopez, Machenaud; Baille, Chat, Setiano, Le Roux, Gabrillagues, Iturria, Camara, Picamoles (c). Replacements: Guirado, Poirot, Slimani, Vahaamahina, Alldritt, Serin, Ntamack, Medard. USA: Teo, Scully (c), Brache, Campbell, Iosefo, MacGinty, Davies; Fry, Taufetee, Lamositele, Brakeley, Civetta, Lamborn, Germishuys, Dolan. Replacements: Fawsitt, Kilifi, Mullen, Peterson, Pinkelman, De Haas, Magie, Palamo. It\u2019s been 11 days since France played their opening fixture of this World Cup \u2013 a narrow, thrilling and somewhat fortunate win over Argentina that was largely forgotten as the tournament hit warp speed. Since then, Jacques Brunel\u2019s boys have kept their heads down at training camp and let the drama unfold elsewhere.

      "body": "<h2>28 May: Sheffield</h2> <p>I am annoyed with myself for booking this tour. In the five months since my daughter Riri was born, we have barely been apart. Motherhood, for me, has been a meditation \u2013 a scrunchie-wearing, vomit-stained, oxytocin-induced trance. When Shaun, who is playing guitar at the London show, came over yesterday to rehearse, I could barely speak. Riri and I are codependent. I only know the language of nappy rash and baby-led weaning.</p> <p>My only consolation this morning was putting her in a new onesie. It has the cast of Frasier dressed up as Kiss on it, and it says \u201cI\u2019m Listening Tour\u201d. I take photos of her as we wait for Caz, our tour manager, to arrive. Then I realise that Caz <em>will </em>arrive at some point. I rush upstairs to throw muslins into a suitcase. My guitars have been packed for days, gathering dust in the hall. At this point, I\u2019d rather forget a guitar than a breast pump.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8b822a9f1d1b658badcf94294fbd7a59c606eb8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b822a9f1d1b658badcf94294fbd7a59c606eb8b/0_0_1512_2016/750.jpg\" alt=\"That Frasier onesie.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">That Frasier onesie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emmy the Great</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the van pulls up, I nervously eye the unbelievable pile of baby equipment on the doorstep. I had forgotten the key part of touring was loading and unloading. My Auntie Lesley, who has volunteered for childcare, is our only crew. She is a retired flight attendant and not a roadie. Riri is a baby, and not a roadie. I hand her to Auntie, and start lifting cases. Thanks to the muscle memory of past tours, this gives me a thrill.</p> <p>Twenty minutes into the drive, Riri takes her biggest ever shit. The Frasier sleepsuit is removed in a petrol station forecourt on the M25. We drive for six hours, stopping often for feeds. We are incredibly late for soundcheck. Then we are late getting to the hotel for the bedtime routine. Then I am late getting on stage, because I was laundering pooey clothes in the bathtub. \u201cHello everybody!\u201d I say, forgetting the lyrics to every song.</p> <p>But my fans are my friends. They know I\u2019ve just had a baby. They take their phones out and Google the lyrics. They laugh as my fingers land on all the wrong strings for the final riff of Dylan,<em> </em>and give thumbs ups when I start War again on the piano. At the end of the set, they line up to tell me, at the merch desk, that it gets easier. They tweet kind words of support, which I scroll through on the way to the hotel, my baby\u2019s poo still under my nails. Then I run towards our room and lie beside her absolutely enormous and cumbersome sleep pod, holding her hand and murmuring that I will never leave her again.</p> <h2>29 May: Newcastle</h2> <p>Our travelling party sounds like a mashup of 90s films \u2013 Four Women and a Baby. As well as Auntie, Caz, Riri and I, there is Bishi, the special guest at the shows. After breakfast, she meets us at the hotel lobby and shyly asks for a cuddle from Riri.</p> <p>\u201cDid you sleep?\u201d she asks, following up from the conversation we had yesterday when we met. Bishi, a genuinely friendly person, tried to get to know us. Even though her album, <a href=\"https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/bishi/albion_voice/\">Albion Voice</a>, is one of my favourites, I could only babble: \u201cRiri is going through a sleep regression. She wakes up every hour.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD9_jRCCzuQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mD9_jRCCzuQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?&amp;v=mD9_jRCCzuQ\">Watch the video for Emmy the Great\u2019s Algorithm</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The regression came on a week before tour. I fear it will get worse now that Riri is separated from her dad, who couldn\u2019t get the time off work. Before we left for tour, I told him: \u201cI\u2019m sure it will be fine to combine touring and baby care, the two most exhausting things I\u2019ve ever experienced.\u201d On the road towards Newcastle, I hold Riri\u2019s hand as she sleeps in the car seat, and nap for two glorious, unbroken hours. It\u2019s the most rested I\u2019ve felt in months.</p> <p>Soundcheck is also the longest I\u2019ve been away from Riri. With a bit of headspace, I am able to talk to Bishi properly. She lets me handle her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jun/30/electronic-music-school-lessons-ableton-youtube\">Ableton Push</a>, and we debate the best EQ for her sitar. I feel almost normal. When the gig begins, I remember how to perform.</p> <p>At the end of the gig, my boobs fill up with milk. I check the time. Later, at the hotel, Auntie tells me that Riri cried at around 10:45. \u201cI know,\u201d I say.</p> <h2>31 May: Birmingham</h2> <p>Tomorrow is our day off. Tour manager Caz\u2019s parents have kindly invited us to stay at their house tonight, and Riri has a firm playdate with Caz\u2019s two kids tomorrow. All this is taking place in Bedford, so tonight Riri and Auntie will hang in the dressing room during the gig. There will be no bedtime routine in a hotel.</p> <p>Just before soundcheck, I realise I didn\u2019t load the nappies. I pop out to the van to get them. There are no windows in the boot of the van, and I fumble to reach the bag in the far corner. I hear a slam. In total darkness, I cannot feel a handle on the inside of the door.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I pop out to the van for nappies. There are no windows, and I fumble to reach the bag in the corner. I hear a slam. I did not bring my phone\u2026</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Because I am trying to use my phone less around the baby, I did not bring it, so I can\u2019t call anyone or use the flashlight. Cold sweat gathers on my palms as I start pounding on the side of the van, yelling for someone to come. I can\u2019t tell if the panic is because of the enclosed space, or because Auntie might get Riri hooked on formula while I wait to be rescued. After five minutes, an extremely nervous man opens the boot from the outside. He looks unsure of whether he\u2019s just busted a human trafficking ring. I wave the diaper bag. \u201cForgot nappies! Hahaha!\u201d</p> <p>After the gig, there is a club night. I beg the DJ not to turn the volume up until I\u2019ve got the baby out of the building. She turns it down for half a second, then quite clearly makes it 12 times louder. (If you\u2019re reading this, Dr Ho, Riri is safely in the dressing room with ears covered. Please don\u2019t quit being our paediatrician.)</p> <p>I think about the concept of the \u201cgood-enough mother\u201d. Sure, a perfect mother wouldn\u2019t unload her infant through a club night on Friday in Birmingham<em>,</em> but maybe a good-enough mother would? Pondering this, I run down the fire exit, into the street.</p> <h2>2 June: Liverpool</h2> <p>There is a new mum in the venue who has left her six-week-old at home. \u201cI\u2019ve just spilled all my breast milk in the Portaloo,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought you would understand my pain.\u201d She is right.

      "bodyText": "28 May: Sheffield I am annoyed with myself for booking this tour. In the five months since my daughter Riri was born, we have barely been apart. Motherhood, for me, has been a meditation \u2013 a scrunchie-wearing, vomit-stained, oxytocin-induced trance. When Shaun, who is playing guitar at the London show, came over yesterday to rehearse, I could barely speak. Riri and I are codependent. I only know the language of nappy rash and baby-led weaning. My only consolation this morning was putting her in a new onesie. It has the cast of Frasier dressed up as Kiss on it, and it says \u201cI\u2019m Listening Tour\u201d. I take photos of her as we wait for Caz, our tour manager, to arrive. Then I realise that Caz will arrive at some point. I rush upstairs to throw muslins into a suitcase. My guitars have been packed for days, gathering dust in the hall. At this point, I\u2019d rather forget a guitar than a breast pump. As the van pulls up, I nervously eye the unbelievable pile of baby equipment on the doorstep. I had forgotten the key part of touring was loading and unloading. My Auntie Lesley, who has volunteered for childcare, is our only crew. She is a retired flight attendant and not a roadie. Riri is a baby, and not a roadie. I hand her to Auntie, and start lifting cases. Thanks to the muscle memory of past tours, this gives me a thrill. Twenty minutes into the drive, Riri takes her biggest ever shit. The Frasier sleepsuit is removed in a petrol station forecourt on the M25. We drive for six hours, stopping often for feeds. We are incredibly late for soundcheck. Then we are late getting to the hotel for the bedtime routine. Then I am late getting on stage, because I was laundering pooey clothes in the bathtub. \u201cHello everybody!\u201d I say, forgetting the lyrics to every song. But my fans are my friends. They know I\u2019ve just had a baby. They take their phones out and Google the lyrics. They laugh as my fingers land on all the wrong strings for the final riff of Dylan, and give thumbs ups when I start War again on the piano. At the end of the set, they line up to tell me, at the merch desk, that it gets easier. They tweet kind words of support, which I scroll through on the way to the hotel, my baby\u2019s poo still under my nails. Then I run towards our room and lie beside her absolutely enormous and cumbersome sleep pod, holding her hand and murmuring that I will never leave her again. 29 May: Newcastle Our travelling party sounds like a mashup of 90s films \u2013 Four Women and a Baby. As well as Auntie, Caz, Riri and I, there is Bishi, the special guest at the shows. After breakfast, she meets us at the hotel lobby and shyly asks for a cuddle from Riri. \u201cDid you sleep?\u201d she asks, following up from the conversation we had yesterday when we met. Bishi, a genuinely friendly person, tried to get to know us. Even though her album, Albion Voice, is one of my favourites, I could only babble: \u201cRiri is going through a sleep regression. She wakes up every hour.\u201d The regression came on a week before tour. I fear it will get worse now that Riri is separated from her dad, who couldn\u2019t get the time off work. Before we left for tour, I told him: \u201cI\u2019m sure it will be fine to combine touring and baby care, the two most exhausting things I\u2019ve ever experienced.\u201d On the road towards Newcastle, I hold Riri\u2019s hand as she sleeps in the car seat, and nap for two glorious, unbroken hours. It\u2019s the most rested I\u2019ve felt in months. Soundcheck is also the longest I\u2019ve been away from Riri. With a bit of headspace, I am able to talk to Bishi properly. She lets me handle her Ableton Push, and we debate the best EQ for her sitar. I feel almost normal. When the gig begins, I remember how to perform. At the end of the gig, my boobs fill up with milk. I check the time. Later, at the hotel, Auntie tells me that Riri cried at around 10:45. \u201cI know,\u201d I say. 31 May: Birmingham Tomorrow is our day off. Tour manager Caz\u2019s parents have kindly invited us to stay at their house tonight, and Riri has a firm playdate with Caz\u2019s two kids tomorrow. All this is taking place in Bedford, so tonight Riri and Auntie will hang in the dressing room during the gig. There will be no bedtime routine in a hotel. Just before soundcheck, I realise I didn\u2019t load the nappies. I pop out to the van to get them. There are no windows in the boot of the van, and I fumble to reach the bag in the far corner. I hear a slam. In total darkness, I cannot feel a handle on the inside of the door. Because I am trying to use my phone less around the baby, I did not bring it, so I can\u2019t call anyone or use the flashlight. Cold sweat gathers on my palms as I start pounding on the side of the van, yelling for someone to come. I can\u2019t tell if the panic is because of the enclosed space, or because Auntie might get Riri hooked on formula while I wait to be rescued. After five minutes, an extremely nervous man opens the boot from the outside. He looks unsure of whether he\u2019s just busted a human trafficking ring. I wave the diaper bag. \u201cForgot nappies! Hahaha!\u201d After the gig, there is a club night. I beg the DJ not to turn the volume up until I\u2019ve got the baby out of the building. She turns it down for half a second, then quite clearly makes it 12 times louder. (If you\u2019re reading this, Dr Ho, Riri is safely in the dressing room with ears covered. Please don\u2019t quit being our paediatrician.) I think about the concept of the \u201cgood-enough mother\u201d. Sure, a perfect mother wouldn\u2019t unload her infant through a club night on Friday in Birmingham, but maybe a good-enough mother would? Pondering this, I run down the fire exit, into the street. 2 June: Liverpool There is a new mum in the venue who has left her six-week-old at home. \u201cI\u2019ve just spilled all my breast milk in the Portaloo,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought you would understand my pain.\u201d She is right. I can literally think of nothing more depressing than wasting a pumped feed. \u201cYou really can cry over spilled milk,\u201d she says, as we hug. 4 June: Manchester Manchester is a home-on-tour for me. I have a friend here, Bernie, who I have been staying with since my very first days of making music. Back then, her youngest child was eight. Now he\u2019s an adult, and I am about to introduce her to my baby. I am almost shy as we park in the familiar drive, self-conscious about the changes that motherhood has wrought in me.

      "bodyText": "Traffic is light on the two creaking pontoon bridges over the Tigris that mark the only official crossing into the autonomous region of north-east Syria, a little known area of 5 million people engaged in a radical political experiment. At the border post stands a distinctive billboard: a martyrs\u2019 memorial to the men and women who died eradicating the Islamic State (Isis), as well as those killed fighting what has become a more serious threat \u2013 Turkey. \u201cOur martyrs are our honour,\u201d the poster says, depicting 40 foreign fighters, including a Briton, Anna Campbell, who was killed in March last year, aged 26, defending the city of Afrin against a Turkish incursion. An estimated 12,000 fighters from the north-east region died in the territorial struggle against Isis, which ended in March, and a further 20,000 were wounded. What was initially a Kurdish force of ground troops with air and logistical support from a US-led coalition has expanded into an administration controlling 30% of Syria, east of the Euphrates river. North-east Syria is the largest part of the country outside the control of President Bashar al-Assad. Once a Kurdish area, it is now governed under a communal structure involving a complex set of committees representing seven \u201ccantons\u201d \u2013 including Sunni-Arab dominated areas \u2013 with each post jointly held by a man and a woman. Westerners in the area still travel under armed guard in fast-driven vehicles, and there are obvious signs of war damage, decaying infrastructure and only the most basic economy. According to the local military, Isis sleeper cells remain active. The administration says it holds 6,000 Isis prisoners, although the figure may be higher, and over 100,000 displaced persons in overcrowded prisons and increasingly lawless camps, which officials admit they are struggling to control. Local politicians are concerned about what they say is western indifference. Amina Omar, the co-chair of the Syrian Democratic Council in the desert town of Ain Issa, said \u201cwe deserve to be supported\u201d in the light of the sacrifices of the eight-year war against Isis. Omar said: \u201cWe have had no political support from the international community to begin working towards our aims\u201d and accused Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, of wanting \u201cto initiate a war\u201d. At the UN general assembly in New York last week, Erdo\u011fan called for the creation of a 30km deep \u201csafe zone\u201d on the Syrian side of the border that could resettle up to 3 million refugees currently in Turkey, a proposal that the fledgling administration has already rejected. \u201cThis is blackmailing the refugees,\u201d Omar said. A cross-party British parliamentary delegation, led by Labour backbencher Lloyd Russell-Moyle, visited north-east Syria in September to begin a process of rallying political support. \u201cGlobal civilisation owes them a debt, both of honour and of practical assistance to rebuild their damaged region,\u201d he said. Until now, UK participation has been limited to an unacknowledged presence of British special forces, with whom commanders of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) say they enjoy \u201ca good relationship\u201d. The UK forces are based with 1,000 US troops who provide ultimate support to the fledgling administration. Political engagement has been minimal. On a visit to London in February, \u00celham Ehmed, the co- of the \u201cexecutive council\u201d of the Syrian Democratic Council, was only met by mid-ranking civil servants in a cafe away from the Foreign Office building. North-east Syria\u2019s leftist ideology was inspired by Abdullah \u00d6calan, one of the founders of the separatist Kurdish PKK in Turkey, where he has been imprisoned since 1999. It is particularly visible in the country\u2019s male YPG and female YPJ militias, key components of the SDF, whose list of martyrs highlights their defence against Isis and \u201cTurkish fascism\u201d. But as the fighting has drawn to a conclusion, north-east Syria has sought to reinvent itself. It is no longer a solely Kurdish region: about 1.5 million of the population are Kurds, clustered near the Turkish border where the safe zone is proposed, while the rest are mostly Sunni Arabs from former Isis centres in the Euphrates valley. Polygamy and underage marriage have been outlawed as part of a \u201claw of women\u201d but while this has been observed in Kurdish areas, implementation in newly taken Arab areas has been patchy. Relations with Assad\u2019s Russian-backed regime are relatively calm, although limited, with officials even acknowledging privately that they sell some of the oil they control west of the Euphrates, in defiance of US sanctions. \u201cThere is no serious fight and there is no serious dialogue,\u201d said Gen Mazlum Kobane, the commander of the SDF. Instead the focus is on placating Turkey. The \u00d6calan connection has been dramatically toned down. Once ubiquitous posters of the jailed leader are in shorter supply, although are still found inside some public buildings as well on the martyrs\u2019 billboard. \u201cWe are willing to do whatever it takes not to threaten the national security of Turkey,\u201d Kobane said. The militias are integrated into the 70,000 strong SDF, which is also 35% female, and politicians claim that there is little or no PKK influence. \u201cOur project has nothing to do with the PKK at all,\u201d Omar argued, although she acknowledged that many PKK members have come from Syria. North-east Syria is careful not to describe itself as independent, at a time when there is no international appetite for partition. But US military support has become critical. Last December, Donald Trump announced a plan to withdraw all ground troops from Syria in the belief that Isis was defeated. After intense lobbying the decision was reversed, and local politicians diplomatically said that Trump had been \u201cwrongly briefed\u201d on the military situation. Instead, north-east Syria agreed to withdraw SDF and YPJ forces away from the Turkish border and allow US and Turkish soldiers to patrol, creating a border buffer zone 5km deep between the Tigris and the Euphrates, and 20km deep for heavy weapons. The concern locally is that the deal has not proved to be enough to placate Turkey. \u201cPresident Erdo\u011fan seems to regret what has been agreed,\u201d Kobane said, warning the Turks to brace themselves \u201cfor a long war\u201d if they try to invade. Mindful of Turkish sensibilities, last week Brig Gen Christian Wortman, the deputy director of operations in the US-European command, heaped praise on the Turks as he talked up the new security arrangement. \u201cThe intention of this security mechanism is to address Turkey\u2019s legitimate security concerns,\u201d Wortman said. Memories, however, linger of Turkey\u2019s 2018 occupation of Afrin, historically a Kurdish area, and the ensuing population displacement which has seen thousands of Kurds leave. Photographs circulate in Kurdish political circles showing the destruction of agricultural areas and the desecration of cemeteries, and it is estimated that 30% of SDF leaders come from Afrin, the bulk of whom are opposed to the border zone settlement that has been agreed with Turkey. Dr Abdulkarim Omar, the co-chair of foreign affairs of the SDC, accuses Turkey of human rights violations, and says that the occupation was allowed to take place through a deal between Turkey and Russia, and \u201camid the silence of the international community, so there was a kind of international cover\u201d. They hope that by rallying western support that won\u2019t happen again.",

All of this makes clear (if it wasn\u2019t already clear) that Trump will use the full power of the United States to compel countries to do his dirty work. The reports of more hidden transcripts of presidential conversations \u2013 a practice that appears to extend at least to conversations with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and Saudi Arabia\u2019s leader, Mohammed bin Salman \u2013 raise serious questions about what other US interests Trump has sacrificed for his own gain. The possibilities for Trump to undermine US interests are endless. If allies want the United States to uphold treaties, maybe Trump will demand cash payments \u2013 not to the United States, but to Trump himself. If countries want good trade terms, maybe Trump will require them to fabricate scandals about members of Congress who are investigating him. Perhaps China will sweeten the pot of a trade deal with more trademarks for Ivanka Trump\u2019s businesses or assistance in her father\u2019s re-election campaign. In fact, there is a report that Trump may have already attempted to ask China to look into the Biden family. At their next summit, the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, could offer to use North Korea\u2019s cyber-hacking capabilities to help Trump\u2019s campaign in exchange for sanctions relief. We\u2019re through the looking glass now. America\u2019s friends are perplexed, and the damage could be incalculable. Some countries may try to placate Trump because the United States is indeed powerful and they are scared that the US mob-boss-in-chief might break their legs. But they will hate us, look for other options, and ditch us at the first opportunity. Our closest allies will reject us. No matter how important the US alliance is for these countries, the current scandal will force them to distance themselves even further from the United States. Intelligence cooperation could slow because allies know Trump is abusing those channels. No one will have faith in US commitments because they fear that Trump will sell them out for personal gain. The United States under Trump could be treated like a powerful autocracy \u2013 a country that must be dealt with, but not trusted, and always hedged against. Trump must be held to account for the sake of national security.",

Sticking with north London, former Spurs player Teemu Tainio clocks in at 63.6%.

Chris Warner writes: \u201c\u2018One for the Bristol City\u2019 by the Wurzels got to No 66 in the UK charts I believe.\u201d It did, Chris. It was first released by Somerset\u2019s leading scrumpy and western band in 1977 to unofficially celebrate the club\u2019s promotion into the top flight but there are no records of whether it charted. It was soon after adopted as the club\u2019s official anthem and the Robins run out to it to this day. A re-release in 2007 made it to No 66.</p> <p>Surely we can go higher than that though can\u2019t we? Well, only if we head to Germany. \u201cIn 2000, Die Toten Hosen had a song called \u2018Bayern\u2019 which reached No 8 in the national charts,\u201d writes Kristof, who also has a warning for us. \u201cThe chorus translates to \u2018I would never join Bayern M\u00fcnchen\u2019.

Those involving home or away advantage in the play-off semi-finals may be resolved by alternate methods which are mutually agreed.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>\u201cTherefore, if our hypothetical team loses the extra game, they have one extra League One game to play prior to entering the play-offs, making 97 in total.</p> <p>\u201cTwo side notes, the guidelines were not clear if a play-off would also be required to separate the bottom-placed team in the play-offs and the team that just missed out. If so, our scenario could equally apply to a League One team finishing sixth or seventh and winning the resulting play-off. There is also a possibility envisaged in Regulation 9.8 of more than one such additional game: \u2018League match or matches,\u2019 potentially resulting in a 98th game through a two-legged tie for example.\u201d</p> <h2>Knowledge archive</h2> <p><strong>\u201cA Southend-supporting friend claims the team once played a league game at Wembley? Is he having me on?\u201d</strong> asked Stuart Jacks in April 2012.</p> <p>Ludicrously, he wasn\u2019t. Southend were one of two teams \u2013 Brentford being the other \u2013 to play against Clapton Orient in Division Three (South) at Wembley back in 1930, owing to ground improvement work at Orient\u2019s Lea Bridge Stadium. <a href=\"http://www.leytonorient.com/page/History/0,,10439~1026584,00.html\" title=\"\">Their official website</a> took up the story:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Following a league match against Torquay (which the O\u2019s won), officials from the Devon club complained about the perimeter fence being too close to the pitch.

      "bodyText": "\u201cA conversation about Aaron Mooy (55.55% vowels) made us wonder which current player in the English top flight has the highest proportion of vowels in their combined first and last names? After much discussion we came up with \u00c9tienne Capoue (61.54% vowels). Are there any current (or past) Premier League players with a higher \u2018vowelage\u2019 rate?\u201d wonders Richard Barnett (28.57%). There certainly are, Richard. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have plenty of people reminding you of J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Aliadi\u00e8re (62.5%),\u201d writes Brian Spurr. Sticking with north London, former Spurs player Teemu Tainio clocks in at 63.6%. Mike Turnbull winds the clock back more than 40 years to improve on that. \u201cGood old Ian Ure of early 70s Arsenal and shortness of name fame would seem to have 66.67% of his name in vowels.\u201d Chris Page points out that Iain Dowie, George Weah\u2019s \u2013 ahem \u2013 \u201ccousin\u201d Ali Dia and Ugo Ehiogu could all match this figure, while the Guardian\u2019s own Chris Taylor offers a really snappy example in Edu, who comes in at the same percentage figure despite having only one consonant in his name. \u201cHad either Ali Daei or Lounes Gaouaoui ever appeared in the Premier League, we could push it up to 71.43%,\u201d writes Rob Hick. We can match that figure with a former Premier League player, though. \u201cOla Aina, now at Torino, has a name that is 71.43% vowels,\u201d points out Steve Hyde. \u201cLiverpool\u2019s Ovie Ejaria, on loan at Reading, is close behind on 70%.\u201d A tip of the hat to Chris Page, who also stumbled upon the vowel-heavy Aina. Songs sharing names with teams \u201cAmanda Palmer released a single called Leeds United, and The Divine Comedy a track called Queen of the South \u2013 what\u2019s the highest-charting song to share its name with a football team?\u201d tweets NotThatHunter. Let\u2019s keep this in the spirit of the question and discount songs officially written for clubs \u2013 and unless the song title intentionally mentions a club, we\u2019re also going to ignore them. So tracks such as Freddie Mercury and Montserrat Caball\u00e9\u2019s \u2018\u201cBarcelona\u201d are out. It doesn\u2019t leave us with much but here goes. Chris Warner writes: \u201c\u2018One for the Bristol City\u2019 by the Wurzels got to No 66 in the UK charts I believe.\u201d It did, Chris. It was first released by Somerset\u2019s leading scrumpy and western band in 1977 to unofficially celebrate the club\u2019s promotion into the top flight but there are no records of whether it charted. It was soon after adopted as the club\u2019s official anthem and the Robins run out to it to this day. A re-release in 2007 made it to No 66. Surely we can go higher than that though can\u2019t we? Well, only if we head to Germany. \u201cIn 2000, Die Toten Hosen had a song called \u2018Bayern\u2019 which reached No 8 in the national charts,\u201d writes Kristof, who also has a warning for us. \u201cThe chorus translates to \u2018I would never join Bayern M\u00fcnchen\u2019. Whether you like Bayern or not , it\u2019s a terrible song, don\u2019t ever listen to it, seriously.\u201d We already have. It\u2019s diabolical but we\u2019re going to embed the official video anyway. Theoretically playing more than 90 games in a season (revisited again) We\u2019re getting to the small print now, but it seems that David Southworth\u2019s 96-game English season (last week) can potentially be topped \u2026 Here are Dan and James. \u201cAssuming David\u2019s 96 games are correct, there is potential for one additional game in the League One season,\u201d they write. \u201cIf the teams finishing second and third are exactly level (on points, goal difference, goals scored, head to head, wins, goals scored in away games, best disciplinary, lowest red cards), then Regulation 9.8 of the EFL rules states: If the above procedures do not separate the clubs, then the clubs concerned shall play off a deciding league match or matches under arrangements determined by the League \u2026 Guidance: play-off matches as detailed above only take place in practice when directly involving automatic promotion or relegation places. Those involving home or away advantage in the play-off semi-finals may be resolved by alternate methods which are mutually agreed. \u201cTherefore, if our hypothetical team loses the extra game, they have one extra League One game to play prior to entering the play-offs, making 97 in total. \u201cTwo side notes, the guidelines were not clear if a play-off would also be required to separate the bottom-placed team in the play-offs and the team that just missed out. If so, our scenario could equally apply to a League One team finishing sixth or seventh and winning the resulting play-off. There is also a possibility envisaged in Regulation 9.8 of more than one such additional game: \u2018League match or matches,\u2019 potentially resulting in a 98th game through a two-legged tie for example.\u201d Knowledge archive \u201cA Southend-supporting friend claims the team once played a league game at Wembley? Is he having me on?\u201d asked Stuart Jacks in April 2012. Ludicrously, he wasn\u2019t. Southend were one of two teams \u2013 Brentford being the other \u2013 to play against Clapton Orient in Division Three (South) at Wembley back in 1930, owing to ground improvement work at Orient\u2019s Lea Bridge Stadium. Their official website took up the story: Following a league match against Torquay (which the O\u2019s won), officials from the Devon club complained about the perimeter fence being too close to the pitch. The Football League was duly asked to inspect the ground and agreed that alterations had to be made before any more games could take place, suddenly the Orient found themselves without a stadium to play in. Incredible as it seems Wembley was suggested and the O\u2019s actually played two league games in 1930 against Brentford and Southend United, winning 3-0 and 3-1 respectively. To this day the Orient is the only Football League side to have played home games at Wembley Stadium! Since then of course, Tottenham Hotspur joined Orient in becoming league residents at Wembley. \u2022 For more from the font of nerdvana, click this thing here. Can you help? \u201cWith regards to Barcelona\u2019s \u20ac300 Griezmann-related fine, has there ever been a lighter monetary slap on the wrist for a football club versus club revenue?\u201d asks Tony McGlennon. \u201cI recently stumbled upon this article about Tony Hibbert signing for an unbeaten Sunday league team in 2017 and missing a penalty for them in a 1-0 defeat on his debut.

East Germany may be a \u201cPopular\u201d democracy, a new democracy or a true democracy: but it will never be a democracy plain and simple, and in its attempts to prove it is one lies its greatest weakness. There can be few East Germans who do not note the postponement of elections or who are ignorant of the manipulations which won a grudging popular approval for the People\u2019s Council, on which the new Government is based. This is an edited extract. Read the editorial in full. In October 1989, East Germany\u2019s 40th anniversary celebrations were overshadowed by anti-government protests. Visiting the country, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev told Erich Honeker, his GDR host, that \u2018life punishes those who delay.\u2019",

      "body": "<h2>One thing to watch out for this season \u2026</h2> <p>Following some fairly <a href=\"https://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/golden-knights-gm-says-league-apologized-game-7-penalty-call/\">disastrous calls (or non-calls)</a> in the 2019 playoffs, the NHL altered both video review and the coach\u2019s challenge. Refs will now be able to review major (non-fighting) or match penalties, and judge whether they should be reduced to a minor infraction. And this year, coaches can ask for a review of a goal they think resulted from a play that should have been whistled dead. There\u2019s nothing necessarily controversial about either of these changes \u2013 for now. But give it a few months. <strong>CH</strong></p> <p>The Devils traded for one of the most recognizable players in the league and it wasn\u2019t their biggest move of the offseason. PK Subban arrived to anchor the New Jersey defense, but center Jack Hughes, maybe the most hyped American prospect ever, is driving the excitement in Newark. Hughes, the top overall pick of the 2019 draft and six months from his 19th birthday, is a frontrunner for the Calder Trophy and expected to score around 60 points in his first NHL season. <strong>GB</strong></p> <p>The NHL has introduced a new face-off rule. Attacking teams can choose which side of the ice play will be restarted in the offensive zone in four situations: after an icing, at the start of a power play, on a shot from outside the red line frozen by the goalie and when a defensive skater unintentionally dislodges the net. In previous seasons, the face-off location was a judgment call made by officials after the play was blown dead. One of the league\u2019s best face-off men, LA\u2019s Anze Kopitar, said being able to choose face-off location is going \u201cto be big.\u201d Centers usually have a stronger side when it comes to winning face-offs. <strong>CR</strong></p> <h2>After the St Louis Blues broke their Stanley Cup drought, which of the following teams are likely to end their title-less streaks? Toronto (51 seasons), Buffalo and Vancouver (both 48), Philadelphia (43)?</h2> <p>The most obvious answer here is Toronto, given the Leafs were the only team on this list to make the playoffs last season. But Toronto\u2019s curse means that the next team to break their drought will inevitably be the team that\u2019s closest to Toronto without actually being Toronto. So, an early congrats to the Buffalo Sabres. <strong>CH</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s Toronto and it\u2019s not particularly close. Buffalo and Vancouver are fairly safe bets to miss the playoffs and the Flyers were one of the 2018-19 season\u2019s biggest disappointments. The Leafs have two of the game\u2019s elite young forwards (center Auston Matthews and right wing Mitch Marner are 22) and a franchise center in John Tavares. Their firepower is remarkable. <strong>GB</strong></p> <p>Toronto, of course. The Leafs are investing more than $40m on their top four forwards this season, so they better have something to show for it. The Leafs weren\u2019t happy with their third straight opening-round playoff exit, so they made changes. They traded the undisciplined Nazem Kadri to Colorado and picked up a good defenseman in Tyson Barrie. The young core of Auston Matthews, Mitch Marner, William Nylander and Morgan Rielly are maturing at the same time and John Tavares is coming off a career-high 47-goal season. <strong>CR</strong></p> <h2>One bold prediction \u2026</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd5b529512c187105554fda87b2c2e652f1ae283\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd5b529512c187105554fda87b2c2e652f1ae283/0_0_2894_1736/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Johnny Gaudreau is a player to watch this season\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Johnny Gaudreau is a player to watch this season.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sergei Belski/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What if (and hear me out) having made the <a href=\"https://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/edmonton-oilers-trade-milan-lucic-calgary-flames-james-neal/\">James Neal-for-Milan Lucic trade</a> with divisional rivals, the Calgary Flames \u2013 a trade that, on paper, was essentially a washout \u2013 the Edmonton Oilers end up with a player who does next to nothing for them (Neal) and have to watch as the one they gave up (Lucic) finds renewed purpose and hope with his new squad, and does everything for the other team the Oilers hoped he might do for them? I know, I know. Impossible. <strong>CH</strong></p> <p>Calgary\u2019s<strong> </strong>Johnny Gaudreau eclipses 100 points for the first time in his career, finishes top-three in Hart Trophy voting and leads the Flames to their first Stanley Cup final appearance since 2003-2004. The legend of \u201cJohnny Hockey\u201d entrenches itself in the United States and his nickname becomes ingrained in the American sports lexicon, leading to widespread endorsements and marketing opportunities. <strong>GB</strong></p> <p>Toronto Maple Leafs winger Mitch Marner is going to win the scoring championship. The contract pressure has been lifted and he can feel secure he will be a Leaf at least for the next six years. He is going into his second season with John Tavares as his center and they\u2019ve been magic together. Marner finished 11<sup>th</sup> in scoring last season, and he\u2019s only going to get better. He\u2019s the closest thing to Patrick Kane as there is in the league (apart from Kane himself, of course). Kane was 27 when he won the scoring title in 2015-16. Marner is only 22, but he is more advanced than Kane was at his age. <strong>CR</strong></p> <h2>Your Hart Trophy winner is ...</h2> <p>Look, I know there are good choices out there.

It\u2019s also a moving portrait of a son caring for his ailing mother, and coming to terms with the grief of losing her.</p> <p>After two decades in America, L-J returns home to the UK for a hand operation. On the flight, a near-catastrophic episode of cabin decompression forces him to meditate on his mortality, and the way everything in life is \u201cprone to malfunction\u201d sooner or later. This insight becomes more urgent when he arrives in Dunwich on the Suffolk coast to find that his mother has aggressive throat cancer, and the \u201cbeautiful house of his childhood\u201d is about to be sold.</p> <p>Visiting her in hospital while she undergoes a tracheostomy, L-J becomes obsessed with how the choices he made as a young man might have changed the current family circumstances. His father left \u201csuddenly, clinically, for another woman\u201d when he was a boy, and now L-J takes on the burden of looking after his mother, clashing with his vulpine and self-centred sister, Ellie, and her boorish husband. As he keeps vigil by her bedside, he\u2019s forced to re-examine all of his certainties.</p> <p>The focus for his mental exploration is a piece of amber found on the beach during a walk with his mother. The idea that a naturally arising flaw \u2013 \u201ca succinosis, a cavity, a fault\u201d \u2013 can allow ancient insects to be caught in a tree\u2019s resin helps him assimilate the fact of death. The glitch that caused his aeroplane to plummet, the sea\u2019s erosion of the coastline, his mother\u2019s tumour: all are part of life\u2019s hidden pattern of growth and decay. Holding the amber up to the light, \u201cigniting the fiery dynamo within\u201d, he marvels that \u201csomething so beautiful \u2026 could be made out of a fault\u201d.</p> <p>While <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2010/oct/04/not-the-booker-lee-rourke\" title=\"\">Rourke</a> doesn\u2019t hold back from the visceral horror of a long illness, there are moments of exquisite understanding between mother and son.

      "bodyText": "Lee Rourke\u2019s admirably economical third novel is an intellectually playful exploration of entropy, mutability and chance. It\u2019s also a moving portrait of a son caring for his ailing mother, and coming to terms with the grief of losing her. After two decades in America, L-J returns home to the UK for a hand operation. On the flight, a near-catastrophic episode of cabin decompression forces him to meditate on his mortality, and the way everything in life is \u201cprone to malfunction\u201d sooner or later. This insight becomes more urgent when he arrives in Dunwich on the Suffolk coast to find that his mother has aggressive throat cancer, and the \u201cbeautiful house of his childhood\u201d is about to be sold. Visiting her in hospital while she undergoes a tracheostomy, L-J becomes obsessed with how the choices he made as a young man might have changed the current family circumstances. His father left \u201csuddenly, clinically, for another woman\u201d when he was a boy, and now L-J takes on the burden of looking after his mother, clashing with his vulpine and self-centred sister, Ellie, and her boorish husband. As he keeps vigil by her bedside, he\u2019s forced to re-examine all of his certainties. The focus for his mental exploration is a piece of amber found on the beach during a walk with his mother. The idea that a naturally arising flaw \u2013 \u201ca succinosis, a cavity, a fault\u201d \u2013 can allow ancient insects to be caught in a tree\u2019s resin helps him assimilate the fact of death. The glitch that caused his aeroplane to plummet, the sea\u2019s erosion of the coastline, his mother\u2019s tumour: all are part of life\u2019s hidden pattern of growth and decay. Holding the amber up to the light, \u201cigniting the fiery dynamo within\u201d, he marvels that \u201csomething so beautiful \u2026 could be made out of a fault\u201d. While Rourke doesn\u2019t hold back from the visceral horror of a long illness, there are moments of exquisite understanding between mother and son. When she talks of \u201cthe beautiful intrusion\u201d of dust motes in a Hammersh\u00f8i painting, \u201cmessing up the otherwise beautiful composition\u201d, it reinforces his belief that \u201cthe best things, the things that speak to us the most, are the mistakes\u201d. He must accept his mother\u2019s flaws and her inevitable passing, in order to love her completely. Occasionally overschematic with its central metaphor, Glitch is nonetheless an unflinching depiction of a son trying to solve the mystery of a parent\u2019s life, as well as coming to terms with his own contradictions. It is a wise and tender novel. \u2022 Jude Cook\u2019s second novel Jacob\u2019s Advice will be published by Unbound. Glitch is published by Dead Ink.",

The \u201cbackstop\u201d is intended as a standstill placeholder to ensure such checks do not have to be imposed between Brexit happening with a deal, and the start of a new free trade agreement yet to be negotiated between the UK and the EU.</p>\n    <p>Theresa May's withdrawal agreement proposed keeping the whole of the UK in a shared customs territory with the EU during this period. An alternative idea involves only Northern Ireland staying in the EU\u2019s customs territory. That would place a customs border in the Irish Sea. May described it as a threat to the constitutional integrity of the UK, but the new prime minister, Boris Johnson, has opened the current talks by proposing an all-Ireland agri-food zone. The suggestion is that he will seek to quietly build on that with further NI-only arrangements.</p>\n    <p>Given an NI-only backstop was an EU proposal in the first place, the U-turn would be warmly welcomed in Brussels, although attempts to give the Northern Ireland assembly a veto on its continuation would not be acceptable, and the DUP would be unlikely to support the prime minister in such a move in parliament.</p>\n    <p>If there is a no-deal Brexit, then there is no backstop.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/daniel-boffey\"><b>Daniel Boffey</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>A senior EU diplomat said the two negotiating sides were in fundamental disagreement, and that there was insufficient time to bridge the gap with just three weeks to go before the UK is due to leave the bloc.</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cThere is a difference in the starting point.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson\u2019s final \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d Brexit offer to Brussels is in danger of being dead on arrival after it was rounded on by government and opposition parties in Ireland. The prime minister\u2019s proposals were described as unworkable, unacceptable and illegal under British domestic law, which bans any new infrastructure on the Irish border that did not exist before Brexit day. \u201cIf this is the final offer, then there is not a deal to be had,\u201d said one EU official. Ireland\u2019s European affairs minister, Helen McEntee, said the plans would not be acceptable to Dublin and raised doubts that Johnson was sincere in wanting a deal. She said: \u201cWhat we are talking about again is picking and choosing certain parts of the single market that would be aligned in Northern Ireland. It is talking about a time limit, which again is not acceptable.\u201d Johnson\u2019s plan to seal a Brexit deal in the next 10 days will be delivered to Brussels on Wednesday with a message that the EU can \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d as this is his final offer. His proposal, which has the full backing of the Democratic Unionist party, has been labelled the \u201ctwo borders for four years plan\u201d. It involves the the UK leaving the EU on 31 October with a transition period as originally envisaged until the end of December 2020, but with the vexed issue of the Irish border being solved by a specific proposal for Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland would remain in regulatory alignment with the EU until 2025 but come out of the customs union with the rest of the UK. It proposes that at the end of 2025 Northern Ireland in conjunction with Ireland would decide on the level of regulatory alignment through a Belfast-Dublin \u201cbilateral lock\u201d in a British-Irish ministerial council. This would mean customs checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic from 1 January 2021, something unacceptable to Dublin and DUP\u2019s rivals in Northern Ireland. The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, said she hoped the EU would take the offer seriously and that she wanted to \u201cfocus on a deal\u201d. But Lisa Chambers, Brexit spokesperson for Fianna F\u00e1il, described the plans as \u201cunacceptable and unworkable\u201d. She tweeted on Wednesday: \u201cUK is reneging on commitments made to citizens on the island of Ireland that there would be no hard border. This would set our country back years. You would have to question if PM Johnson is genuinely serious about getting a deal, this suggests not. \u201cWe need to see something that is credible and if this is what is being proposed it certainly won\u2019t be acceptable not only to the Irish government but to the EU as a whole.\u201d McEntee also suggested the proposals, which will be presented as a fair and generous offer, reneged on previous commitments by the UK to ensure no hard border on the island of Ireland. \u201cIt is still talking about the need and requirement for customs checks. So, again, to go back to the commitments it is no infrastructure or associated checks, protecting the Good Friday agreement and the areas of cooperation, protecting the all-Ireland economy and protecting the single market and our place in it. And if that is what is being proposed it certainly doesn\u2019t do any of that,\u201d she said. The former Northern Ireland secretary Lord Hain said the Brexit plan could break the law and \u201csabotage\u201d the Good Friday agreement. The Labour peer said by insisting on extra customs checks and different trading relationships across the Irish border the government \u201cis proposing to break the law\u201d. He said it would breach Britain\u2019s own Withdrawal Act 2018, which includes a detailed clause specifically banning \u201cborder arrangements between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after exit day that feature physical infrastructure, including border posts, or checks and controls, that did not exist before exit day\u201d. Hain added: \u201cThis will also sabotage the Good Friday peace agreement.\u201d It is understood that Dominic Cummings, the prime minister\u2019s strategist, has warned top advisers that the UK is prepared to walk away if the EU does not engage seriously with the offer. \u201cTo be clear, we won\u2019t be hanging around waiting for them to negotiate with us,\u201d he told a meeting of senior advisers. \u201cIf they reject our offer, that\u2019s it.\u201d EU sources said the outlines of the proposal did not meet the objectives of the Irish backstop, and threatened both the integrity of the single market and peace in Northern Ireland. \u201cIf this is the final offer, then there is not a deal to be had,\u201d said one EU official. A senior EU diplomat said the two negotiating sides were in fundamental disagreement, and that there was insufficient time to bridge the gap with just three weeks to go before the UK is due to leave the bloc. He added: \u201cThere is a difference in the starting point. We want to avoid the border and checks and controls. And the other side are saying, \u2018No we will need some kind of controls, one way or another\u2019, which is difficult for us to accept as it runs into the clear goal of the stability of the island of Ireland.\u201d Philippe Lamberts, a member of the European parliament\u2019s Brexit steering group, said there was no confidence that Johnson could even guarantee the Commons\u2019 support for his proposals. He said: \u201cWe are in a worse situation than we were facing Theresa May because at least Theresa May had a working majority \u2026 The last thing the EU wants to do is to make concessions that won\u2019t fly in Westminster. \u201cMy interpretation of Boris Johnson\u2019s actions since being prime minister is to take the United Kingdom out of the European Union without a deal but with the opportunity to shift the blame to someone else.\u201d",

On Monday Fifa\u2019s players\u2019 status committee, which determines disputes relating to international transfers, found against Cardiff, ordering the club to pay the overdue first \u20ac6m (\u00a35.3m) instalment of the \u20ac17m total payable over three years, which was agreed with the French Ligue 1 club. Cardiff had refused to pay the transfer fee after Sala died, arguing that as there were details in the club\u2019s employment contract with him which were still to be concluded, the transfer had not been finalised.

Seven-year-old Christopher Reese and his single mother, Kate, arrive in the small town of Mill Grove, Pennsylvania, running from their past. \u201cDeep down, Christopher thought maybe she picked it because it seemed tucked away from the rest of the world. One highway in. One highway out. Surrounded by trees.\u201d</p> <p>Christopher is a good kid, but he\u2019s dyslexic and struggles at school; Kate is on the brink financially, piling up bills and living in a motel. Then, bullied and miserable at school, Christopher notices a collection of clouds that look like a face. He follows the face, and finds himself lost in the woods. Six days later, he emerges \u2013 suddenly top of his class, and talking about the \u201cnice man\u201d who led him out. It turns out there\u2019s a whole other world lying behind Mill Grove, \u201can imaginary world filled with hissing ladies and mailbox people with mouths sewn shut and eyes closed with zippers\u201d, one Christopher has found his way to, and where his new friend, the nice man whom nobody else can see but who keeps on whispering to him, needs his help.</p> <p>There are elements of<em> Imaginary Friend </em>that are genuinely frightening: as the nice man talks Christopher into building a tree house \u2013 which, incidentally, he and his gang of friends pull off with amazing skill for a group of seven-year-olds \u2013 the real and imaginary worlds of Mill Grove begin to overlap, and the bad things that lurk around this town are gradually revealed. There\u2019s the hissing lady: \u201cshe turned to teeth and a hissing mouth. Worse than the Wicked Witch. Worse than anything. Four legs like a dog. Or a long neck like a giraffe. Hssss.\u201d The man who lies inside the hollow log. The couple who can\u2019t stop kissing, blood running from their mouths. The children with mouths sewn shut.

      "bodyText": "\u201cDear friend,\u201d writes Charlie, at the beginning of Stephen Chbosky\u2019s much-beloved coming-of-age novel The Perks of Being a Wallflower (1999), \u201cI am writing to you because she said you listen and understand.\u201d Charlie, Chbosky\u2019s troubled teenage \u201cwallflower\u201d, pours out his heart to this friend in a series of letters trying to make sense of his life, but we learn nothing more about him or her. Two decades on, the friend in Chbosky\u2019s follow-up is even more mysterious. Seven-year-old Christopher Reese and his single mother, Kate, arrive in the small town of Mill Grove, Pennsylvania, running from their past. \u201cDeep down, Christopher thought maybe she picked it because it seemed tucked away from the rest of the world. One highway in. One highway out. Surrounded by trees.\u201d Christopher is a good kid, but he\u2019s dyslexic and struggles at school; Kate is on the brink financially, piling up bills and living in a motel. Then, bullied and miserable at school, Christopher notices a collection of clouds that look like a face. He follows the face, and finds himself lost in the woods. Six days later, he emerges \u2013 suddenly top of his class, and talking about the \u201cnice man\u201d who led him out. It turns out there\u2019s a whole other world lying behind Mill Grove, \u201can imaginary world filled with hissing ladies and mailbox people with mouths sewn shut and eyes closed with zippers\u201d, one Christopher has found his way to, and where his new friend, the nice man whom nobody else can see but who keeps on whispering to him, needs his help. There are elements of Imaginary Friend that are genuinely frightening: as the nice man talks Christopher into building a tree house \u2013 which, incidentally, he and his gang of friends pull off with amazing skill for a group of seven-year-olds \u2013 the real and imaginary worlds of Mill Grove begin to overlap, and the bad things that lurk around this town are gradually revealed. There\u2019s the hissing lady: \u201cshe turned to teeth and a hissing mouth. Worse than the Wicked Witch. Worse than anything. Four legs like a dog. Or a long neck like a giraffe. Hssss.\u201d The man who lies inside the hollow log. The couple who can\u2019t stop kissing, blood running from their mouths. The children with mouths sewn shut. Christopher battles with sleep, which would take him into the arms of the hissing lady, and the residents of the real town start to get sicker, and angrier. Reading this book alone in the house, late at night, I will admit to a thud of fear at a bump downstairs, and a rush to switch all the lights on. But there are only so many carnivorous children and menacing deer a reader can take before becoming inured to their terrors, and after a while Imaginary Friend drifts into repetition. Christopher and his friends \u2013 and the adults in the story \u2013 are well drawn, but Chbosky is stage-managing a lot of characters, and as he moves through the gradual disintegration of each of their realities, over 720 pages, his story slows \u2026 and slows.

New York City mayor Bill De Blasio gifted the team the keys to the city. On that day in early July, New York City was the center of women\u2019s soccer \u2026 except for one minor detail. America\u2019s biggest city has no top-flight women\u2019s team to call its own.</p> <p>It\u2019s not alone. In the soccer hotbed of southern California, Los Angeles has no presence in the highest level of women\u2019s professional soccer, either. The two biggest population centers and media markets in the United States aren\u2019t found on the women\u2019s soccer map and no one seems to be able to answer why, when, or even<em> if</em> things will change. The glaring gaps stand as an example of how tenuous professional women\u2019s soccer is in the US beyond the fan chants of \u201cequal pay!\u201d, equity lawsuits against the US Soccer Federation and the hot summer fling every four years.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we see during the World Cup is a tremendous amount of attention on the tournament and the women\u2019s national team,\u201d says Alyse LaHue, general manager of Sky Blue FC, the New Jersey-based team that plays in the National Women\u2019s Soccer League, the top level of women\u2019s professional soccer in the US. Back home, though, that attention doesn\u2019t come easy.</p> <p>Following the World Cup win, most players returned to their NWSL clubs for \u201chomecoming\u201d games where fans could see the stars in action at lower key local games. In August, Carli Lloyd, Rose Lavelle and Mallory Pugh were in action for their teams as Sky Blue hosted the Washington Spirit in an NWSL league game. That match was a rare sell-out at Rutgers University\u2019s Yurcak Field, a one-stand 5,000-capacity venue that serves as Sky Blue\u2019s home ground. After the final whistle, players diligently stayed on the field to sign autographs and take selfies with fans. It was a warm gesture from the players, but it wasn\u2019t like they were in a rush to clean up after the game: Yurcak Field doesn\u2019t have showers in its locker rooms, so players wait until they get home or to a team hotel to change. It was a long way from the World Cup.</p> <p>LaHue, though, has earned a can-do reputation across the league for her effort in dragging Sky Blue toward professional standards. When she learned Yurcak Field would not \u2013 as it usually had \u2013 sell alcohol on the night of the club\u2019s biggest game in years, she stocked up her car with beer and gave it away to fans in a parking lot. Never mind the showers. What about beer?</p> <p>\u201cWe typically don\u2019t get that much coverage [at Sky Blue] and for us, we want to be able to tap into the World Cup attention,\u201d LaHue tells the Guardian. \u201cWe weren\u2019t expecting a sell out for that game but it was an indicator that people tuned in to the World Cup and followed up [with their local team].\u201d</p> <p>Still, after 10 years of existence, much of it troubled by poor leadership and management off the field, exactly where Sky Blue FC sees as \u201clocal\u201d is a mystery. It plays and trains in New Jersey, itself a strong standalone soccer region, but for New York City fans traveling to Yurcak Field in New Jersey without a car can be a four-hour journey on public transport if you add the 30-minute walk to the stadium. For potential fans from the five boroughs, Rutgers University may as well be Montana. The only shared interest with New Jersey is loathing the Holland Tunnel elicits.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"61673886aee0c242a7a33c17198be0e7c74c67c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61673886aee0c242a7a33c17198be0e7c74c67c2/0_0_3418_2211/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Estelle Johnson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"647\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sky Blue defender Estelle Johnson takes a selfie with young fans after a July match against the Washington Spirit in Piscataway, New Jersey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kena Betancur/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some investors have shown interest in launching a New York City team in the NWSL over recent years but have hit multiple roadblocks. The main issue: Sky Blue FC hold geographic rights to a New Jersey and New York City NWSL team. The exact details of those rights are shrouded in their own mystery: Sky Blue FC could not provide exact details of the clause and, after initially citing scheduling issues, NWSL did not respond to multiple requests for comment on this story.</p> <p>In 2013, an agreement for MLS team New York Red Bulls to buy Sky Blue FC was set to go through, until a deal collapsed on deadline day over the finer details of Sky Blue FC\u2019s value. Still, the potential for the Red Bulls to take over Sky Blue was demonstrated in August when Red Bull Arena, located far closer to New York City that Yurcak Field, a one-off game NWSL game between Sky Blue and Reign FC, a match where Reign\u2019s Megan Rapinoe was expected to play but didn\u2019t take the field because of injury, drew almost 10,000 fans to the stadium.</p> <p>(Sky Blue played their final \u201chome\u201d game at Red Bull Arena on Sunday before an announced crowd of 8,314 for an 11am kick off. New York Red Bulls played at the same stadium later in the day. NWSL teams cannot play double headers with MLS teams because MLS takes 30% of ticket price.)</p> <p>\u201cWe have hopes and dreams of being able to play more games at a professional arena, both for the players and the fan experience, but until we play more games at Red Bull Arena it is hard to say [what future plans are],\u201d LaHue says.</p> <p>While Red Bulls left Sky Blue at the altar, MLS rivals New York City FC privately flirt with the idea of a women\u2019s team. City Football Group, which owns NYCFC, fields several professional women\u2019s teams: Manchester City in England\u2019s Women\u2019s Super League and Melbourne City in Australia\u2019s W-League. A pro team in New York City appears to be a natural fit but a City Football Group executive \u2013 speaking on background \u2013 said, geographical rights aside, the organization has to first find a permanent home for its MLS team before it considers launching another professional team. It is still searching for an alternative to playing home games at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx.</p> <p>\u201cWe are committed to women\u2019s football and there would be a lot of interest in doing it when we are ready to do it properly,\u201d the CFG official said. \u201cBut there is nothing close to happening any time soon.\u201d</p> <p>Barring a robust legal challenge from an investor wanting to challenge Sky Blue\u2019s rights to New York City, it\u2019s also doubtful whether NWSL has any interest in adding a team in New York City \u2013 or even the northeast. One investor, keen on launching a team in nearby Connecticut, planned for a start-up to play at Dillon Stadium in Hartford, a venue that has hosted concerts by the Rolling Stones, the Beach Boys and Kiss in the 1960s and 70s, as well as rugby and women\u2019s soccer internationals more recently. The investor shelved its plans, believing the NWSL was more interested in new teams in the midwest and south than the northeast.</p> <p>Also missing from the map: California. Women\u2019s pro soccer has a history on the west coast. Los Angeles Sol played one season in the ill-fated Women\u2019s Professional Soccer in 2009. The team \u2013 boasting Brazilian Marta, Japanese icon Aya Miyama and US star Shannon Boxx \u2013 swept all opponents aside while playing in front of good-sized crowds. It drew 15,000 to its opening game at the Home Depot Center \u2013 home to MLS team LA Galaxy \u2013 and maintained crowds of around 6,000 to 7,000 for home games (ironically, it lost the championship game 1-0 that season \u2026 to Sky Blue).</p> <p>The team\u2019s owner was sports and entertainment behemoth AEG, which pledged to launch the team with the intention to sell after one year. It promptly shut Sol down when a new buyer could not be found. Part of the struggle: the team paid a reported $75,000 to AEG for renting Home Depot Center for home games \u2013 effectively AEG paying itself \u2013 and a reported three-year guaranteed $500,000 per season deal for Marta.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bf39e6eee9bf5706518b10a52ae1249ad8ab0193\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf39e6eee9bf5706518b10a52ae1249ad8ab0193/0_113_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carli Lloyd\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">South Jersey native and World Cup hero Carli Lloyd remains the biggest draw for Sky Blue FC.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Howard Smith/ISI Photos/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>LA Galaxy have affiliated women\u2019s teams based in Orange County and San Diego playing in amateur and semi-professional leagues, while ambitious MLS newcomers Los Angeles FC have added a women\u2019s team to their to-do list. LAFC counts US soccer icon Mia Hamm as a co-owner and held talks with FC Barcelona about a potential partnership. Yet, like their NYCFC, LAFC are also tackling the challenge of being relatively new to MLS.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s obviously a top priority of ours and of me personally,\u201d Hamm said earlier this year. \u201cWe had early discussions last year about partnering with [FC Barcelona], but that didn\u2019t go in the direction that we thought because we were building such a brand here and that\u2019s important for us to do. When we make that commitment [to a women\u2019s team], we want to make sure we can go all in and do it right just like we\u2019ve done with the men\u2019s team.\u201d</p> <p>The caution is real. As one executive explained, the NWSL needs to have stability before investment is considered. In January, prior to the World Cup, A&amp;E Networks pulled out its 25% stake in the league. Staff were cut. Today, calls to the league\u2019s office ring out or are diverted to a voicemail box for CEO Amanda Duffy. Press \u2018star\u2019 to learn that voice mailbox is full.</p> <p>\u201cAll new teams want to take the time and do due diligence,\u201d added one MLS executive.</p> <p>Back in New Jersey, Alyse LaHue is busy with her mission to turn Sky Blue into a true professional team. She understands the work needed to transform the club and recognizes the team needs a new home and the NWSL has its own work to do.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like to continue to see more organization on a league wide level,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are starting to collaborate more and talk about big picture items like broadcast partners, media rights and sponsorship.</p> <p>\u201cNine teams isn\u2019t the number we need to be at for the league, but at the same time I appreciate the cautionary approach. From a stability standpoint, it is important to make sure we are vetting potential partners who are coming in. We have seen a tremendous amount of interest for new teams to come into the league. I think 12 teams is where we want to be and I think that is going to happen in the next few years. There has been enough interest.\u201d</p> <p>As well as locating a stadium closer to New York City that has locker rooms with showers, LaHue\u2019s other agenda item is to find additional investors for Sky Blue FC. The current ownership, which includes New Jersey governor Phil Murphy, has been convinced it needs to double down on its investment and be prepared to lose around $3m per season. Extra pockets are required even if that number is tiny compared to estimates from other NWSL executives that $10m is needed to run a team in the New York City area. Whether any new investor has the resources or influence to pitch Sky Blue as a stand-alone New York City team remain to be seen.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re looking for a new home for 2020 and I always believed that being closer to New York City would be helpful for us,\u201d LaHue sats. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to move into a stadium and straight away get 15,000 people but, at the same time, we can attract fans from New York City and New Jersey. There is no other team in this region. We even have fans that come up from Philadelphia.\u201d</p> <p>Also in play: local politics.</p> <p>\u201cWith one of our owners being the governor of New Jersey, I think our preference for a location is probably obvious,\u201d LaHue says. \u201cTo be fair, the owners want to see this team excel and grow and they realize the options in New Jersey are limited right now. The preference is to stay in New Jersey but they are realistic.\u201d</p> <p>Outside the national team, there\u2019s no ticker-tape parade for women\u2019s professional soccer in the United States just yet. There are many easy questions but few, if any, easy answers.</p>",

America\u2019s biggest city has no top-flight women\u2019s team to call its own. It\u2019s not alone. In the soccer hotbed of southern California, Los Angeles has no presence in the highest level of women\u2019s professional soccer, either. The two biggest population centers and media markets in the United States aren\u2019t found on the women\u2019s soccer map and no one seems to be able to answer why, when, or even if things will change. The glaring gaps stand as an example of how tenuous professional women\u2019s soccer is in the US beyond the fan chants of \u201cequal pay!\u201d, equity lawsuits against the US Soccer Federation and the hot summer fling every four years. \u201cWhat we see during the World Cup is a tremendous amount of attention on the tournament and the women\u2019s national team,\u201d says Alyse LaHue, general manager of Sky Blue FC, the New Jersey-based team that plays in the National Women\u2019s Soccer League, the top level of women\u2019s professional soccer in the US. Back home, though, that attention doesn\u2019t come easy. Following the World Cup win, most players returned to their NWSL clubs for \u201chomecoming\u201d games where fans could see the stars in action at lower key local games. In August, Carli Lloyd, Rose Lavelle and Mallory Pugh were in action for their teams as Sky Blue hosted the Washington Spirit in an NWSL league game. That match was a rare sell-out at Rutgers University\u2019s Yurcak Field, a one-stand 5,000-capacity venue that serves as Sky Blue\u2019s home ground. After the final whistle, players diligently stayed on the field to sign autographs and take selfies with fans. It was a warm gesture from the players, but it wasn\u2019t like they were in a rush to clean up after the game: Yurcak Field doesn\u2019t have showers in its locker rooms, so players wait until they get home or to a team hotel to change. It was a long way from the World Cup. LaHue, though, has earned a can-do reputation across the league for her effort in dragging Sky Blue toward professional standards. When she learned Yurcak Field would not \u2013 as it usually had \u2013 sell alcohol on the night of the club\u2019s biggest game in years, she stocked up her car with beer and gave it away to fans in a parking lot. Never mind the showers. What about beer? \u201cWe typically don\u2019t get that much coverage [at Sky Blue] and for us, we want to be able to tap into the World Cup attention,\u201d LaHue tells the Guardian. \u201cWe weren\u2019t expecting a sell out for that game but it was an indicator that people tuned in to the World Cup and followed up [with their local team].\u201d Still, after 10 years of existence, much of it troubled by poor leadership and management off the field, exactly where Sky Blue FC sees as \u201clocal\u201d is a mystery. It plays and trains in New Jersey, itself a strong standalone soccer region, but for New York City fans traveling to Yurcak Field in New Jersey without a car can be a four-hour journey on public transport if you add the 30-minute walk to the stadium. For potential fans from the five boroughs, Rutgers University may as well be Montana. The only shared interest with New Jersey is loathing the Holland Tunnel elicits. Some investors have shown interest in launching a New York City team in the NWSL over recent years but have hit multiple roadblocks. The main issue: Sky Blue FC hold geographic rights to a New Jersey and New York City NWSL team. The exact details of those rights are shrouded in their own mystery: Sky Blue FC could not provide exact details of the clause and, after initially citing scheduling issues, NWSL did not respond to multiple requests for comment on this story. In 2013, an agreement for MLS team New York Red Bulls to buy Sky Blue FC was set to go through, until a deal collapsed on deadline day over the finer details of Sky Blue FC\u2019s value. Still, the potential for the Red Bulls to take over Sky Blue was demonstrated in August when Red Bull Arena, located far closer to New York City that Yurcak Field, a one-off game NWSL game between Sky Blue and Reign FC, a match where Reign\u2019s Megan Rapinoe was expected to play but didn\u2019t take the field because of injury, drew almost 10,000 fans to the stadium. (Sky Blue played their final \u201chome\u201d game at Red Bull Arena on Sunday before an announced crowd of 8,314 for an 11am kick off. New York Red Bulls played at the same stadium later in the day. NWSL teams cannot play double headers with MLS teams because MLS takes 30% of ticket price.) \u201cWe have hopes and dreams of being able to play more games at a professional arena, both for the players and the fan experience, but until we play more games at Red Bull Arena it is hard to say [what future plans are],\u201d LaHue says. While Red Bulls left Sky Blue at the altar, MLS rivals New York City FC privately flirt with the idea of a women\u2019s team. City Football Group, which owns NYCFC, fields several professional women\u2019s teams: Manchester City in England\u2019s Women\u2019s Super League and Melbourne City in Australia\u2019s W-League. A pro team in New York City appears to be a natural fit but a City Football Group executive \u2013 speaking on background \u2013 said, geographical rights aside, the organization has to first find a permanent home for its MLS team before it considers launching another professional team. It is still searching for an alternative to playing home games at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx. \u201cWe are committed to women\u2019s football and there would be a lot of interest in doing it when we are ready to do it properly,\u201d the CFG official said. \u201cBut there is nothing close to happening any time soon.\u201d Barring a robust legal challenge from an investor wanting to challenge Sky Blue\u2019s rights to New York City, it\u2019s also doubtful whether NWSL has any interest in adding a team in New York City \u2013 or even the northeast. One investor, keen on launching a team in nearby Connecticut, planned for a start-up to play at Dillon Stadium in Hartford, a venue that has hosted concerts by the Rolling Stones, the Beach Boys and Kiss in the 1960s and 70s, as well as rugby and women\u2019s soccer internationals more recently. The investor shelved its plans, believing the NWSL was more interested in new teams in the midwest and south than the northeast. Also missing from the map: California. Women\u2019s pro soccer has a history on the west coast. Los Angeles Sol played one season in the ill-fated Women\u2019s Professional Soccer in 2009. The team \u2013 boasting Brazilian Marta, Japanese icon Aya Miyama and US star Shannon Boxx \u2013 swept all opponents aside while playing in front of good-sized crowds. It drew 15,000 to its opening game at the Home Depot Center \u2013 home to MLS team LA Galaxy \u2013 and maintained crowds of around 6,000 to 7,000 for home games (ironically, it lost the championship game 1-0 that season \u2026 to Sky Blue). The team\u2019s owner was sports and entertainment behemoth AEG, which pledged to launch the team with the intention to sell after one year. It promptly shut Sol down when a new buyer could not be found. Part of the struggle: the team paid a reported $75,000 to AEG for renting Home Depot Center for home games \u2013 effectively AEG paying itself \u2013 and a reported three-year guaranteed $500,000 per season deal for Marta. LA Galaxy have affiliated women\u2019s teams based in Orange County and San Diego playing in amateur and semi-professional leagues, while ambitious MLS newcomers Los Angeles FC have added a women\u2019s team to their to-do list. LAFC counts US soccer icon Mia Hamm as a co-owner and held talks with FC Barcelona about a potential partnership. Yet, like their NYCFC, LAFC are also tackling the challenge of being relatively new to MLS. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously a top priority of ours and of me personally,\u201d Hamm said earlier this year. \u201cWe had early discussions last year about partnering with [FC Barcelona], but that didn\u2019t go in the direction that we thought because we were building such a brand here and that\u2019s important for us to do. When we make that commitment [to a women\u2019s team], we want to make sure we can go all in and do it right just like we\u2019ve done with the men\u2019s team.\u201d The caution is real. As one executive explained, the NWSL needs to have stability before investment is considered. In January, prior to the World Cup, A&amp;E Networks pulled out its 25% stake in the league. Staff were cut. Today, calls to the league\u2019s office ring out or are diverted to a voicemail box for CEO Amanda Duffy. Press \u2018star\u2019 to learn that voice mailbox is full. \u201cAll new teams want to take the time and do due diligence,\u201d added one MLS executive. Back in New Jersey, Alyse LaHue is busy with her mission to turn Sky Blue into a true professional team. She understands the work needed to transform the club and recognizes the team needs a new home and the NWSL has its own work to do. \u201cI\u2019d like to continue to see more organization on a league wide level,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are starting to collaborate more and talk about big picture items like broadcast partners, media rights and sponsorship. \u201cNine teams isn\u2019t the number we need to be at for the league, but at the same time I appreciate the cautionary approach. From a stability standpoint, it is important to make sure we are vetting potential partners who are coming in. We have seen a tremendous amount of interest for new teams to come into the league. I think 12 teams is where we want to be and I think that is going to happen in the next few years. There has been enough interest.\u201d As well as locating a stadium closer to New York City that has locker rooms with showers, LaHue\u2019s other agenda item is to find additional investors for Sky Blue FC. The current ownership, which includes New Jersey governor Phil Murphy, has been convinced it needs to double down on its investment and be prepared to lose around $3m per season. Extra pockets are required even if that number is tiny compared to estimates from other NWSL executives that $10m is needed to run a team in the New York City area. Whether any new investor has the resources or influence to pitch Sky Blue as a stand-alone New York City team remain to be seen. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for a new home for 2020 and I always believed that being closer to New York City would be helpful for us,\u201d LaHue sats. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to move into a stadium and straight away get 15,000 people but, at the same time, we can attract fans from New York City and New Jersey. There is no other team in this region. We even have fans that come up from Philadelphia.\u201d Also in play: local politics. \u201cWith one of our owners being the governor of New Jersey, I think our preference for a location is probably obvious,\u201d LaHue says. \u201cTo be fair, the owners want to see this team excel and grow and they realize the options in New Jersey are limited right now. The preference is to stay in New Jersey but they are realistic.\u201d Outside the national team, there\u2019s no ticker-tape parade for women\u2019s professional soccer in the United States just yet. There are many easy questions but few, if any, easy answers.",

Lanning was on hand to congratulate her teammate, having come to the crease after Rachael Haynes fell for 41 in the 17th over.</p> <p>\u201cIt was just one of those days when everything seems to come out of the middle,\u201d Healy said of her jaw-dropping innings.

      "bodyText": "After Australia secured their latest series win on Tuesday, Alyssa Healy indicated the world champions would not rest in pursuit of achieving higher standards with next year\u2019s World Twenty20 looming large. That left open the somewhat obvious question: how can a team apparently at the pinnacle of their game possibly improve any further? Healy herself delivered a devastating answer 24 hours later when she entered the record books with a brutal 148 not out \u2013 the highest score by a woman in T20Is \u2013 to power Australia to a comprehensive 132-run victory and a clean sweep of the three-match series against Sri Lanka. The wicketkeeper-batter was unstoppable at a sunny North Sydney Oval on Wednesday afternoon as she launched her personal assault on the Sri Lankan bowling attack, reaching a half century off 25 balls and 100 off just 46. In her 101st T20I, it was her maiden century and the fastest ever by an Australian man or woman \u2013 Aaron Finch held the previous record (47 balls) with Meg Lanning next on the list (53). The milestone was brought up with a sweetly-struck straight six \u2013 one of seven throughout her innings \u2013 as Healy passed the previous benchmark of 133 set by Lanning against England at Chelmsford during the Ashes series earlier this year. Lanning was on hand to congratulate her teammate, having come to the crease after Rachael Haynes fell for 41 in the 17th over. \u201cIt was just one of those days when everything seems to come out of the middle,\u201d Healy said of her jaw-dropping innings. She finished with a flourish, hitting a final six in the last over to add to her 19 fours as Australia reached a massive total of 226-2. Lanning was unbeaten on 10; Healy\u2019s opening partner, Beth Mooney, made 14 before being bowled with the score on 59 by Chamari Athapaththu, who also claimed the scalp of Haynes. In the face of such an imposing target, Sri Lankan hopes of chasing it down were slim and firmly rested on the shoulders of Athapaththu, the visitors\u2019 hero of the opening match of this series. The captain and opener notched her own brilliant maiden T20I century on Sunday but there was to be no repeat in game three: she was bowled by Nicola Carey for 30 and with her departure went chances of an already unlikely upset. Harshitha Madavi offered some resistance before being caught off the bowling of Carey for 28 by, who else, Healy. Tayla Vlaeminck also picked up two wickets as Sri Lanka mustered 94-7 off their 20 overs in response. \u201cIt was outrageous, but very much Midge\u2019s style,\u201d Ellyse Perry said afterwards of Healy. \u201c It was an incredible display of batting, and awesome to watch. It\u2019s been nice to put on a show for three games.\u201d Australia will now look to extend their dominance over Sri Lanka in the shortest form of the game to the 50-over format, with a three-match one-day international series to get underway at Brisbane\u2019s Allan Border Field on Saturday.",

Based on interviews with dozens of officials within the White House and the administration, Times reporters Michael D Shear and Julie Hirschfeld Davis recount \u201ca frenzied week of presidential rages\u201d in March, during which Trump\u2019s \u201czeal to stop immigration had sent him lurching for solutions, one more extreme than the next\u201d. The revelations in the Times report are in line with the president\u2019s public attitude toward migrants arriving at the southern border. Last year, he publicly suggested that soldiers shoot migrants who throw rocks at them. Although Trump eventually backed away from his most extreme suggestions, he also reportedly fired aides and advisers who pushed back against his ideas. The story recounts an especially tense relationship between Trump and homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, who often found herself in the position of telling the president why he couldn\u2019t break laws and international norms willy-nilly. Nielsen was eventually dismissed, at the urging of the White House aide Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump\u2019s immigration agenda, who reportedly told Trump that many of his officials were wrong to cite the legal hurdles to enacting the president\u2019s proposals. Although Trump\u2019s border wall, the construction of which has now begun after the Pentagon allowed the shifting of $3.6bn in military funds to finance it, still doesn\u2019t feature moats filled with reptiles or spikes, his administration has found other ways to keep migrants and refugees away. In a federal court hearing on Tuesday, immigration advocates asked judges to block a key immigration policy that forces asylum seekers to await their court hearings in Mexico, where they are not safe and lack access to lawyers. In a report released Tuesday, the advocacy group Human Rights First said that there have been more than 340 public reports of rape, kidnapping, torture and other violent crimes against asylum seekers returned to Mexico under the new Trump policy. Last week, the administration announced that it would set the cap for refugee admissions at an all-time low. The supreme court also ruled to allow the Trump administration deny asylum to anyone who passes through another country on their way to the US, blocking most Central American migrants fleeing violence and poverty who arrive at the southern border. In a dissenting opinion, justices Ruth Bader Ginsberg and Sonia Sotomayor said that the policy \u201caffects some of the most vulnerable people in the western hemisphere\u201d.",

They had access to privileged information and connections to other ministers that few others would have.</p> <p>\u201cNot only are current ministers more likely to grant access to former ministers, but research shows that there is a greater chance that they will accede to the lobbying,\u201d Rennie said. \u201cThis sort of bias in decision-making is inevitable, but should be minimised where possible.</p> <p>\u201cThis gives them significant and undue sway over decisions, and is part of the reason why some countries \u2013 appropriately \u2013 prevent ministers from lobbying for up to five years.\u201d</p> <p>Lillywhite said it was difficult to argue any conflict of interest in situations where a minister was not lobbying in their former portfolio area.

Pyne\u2019s GC Advisory has been engaged by a group of influential South Australian property developers to fight the state Liberal government\u2019s land tax proposals, raising eyebrows given Pyne\u2019s recent leading role in the federal Liberal party. Pyne, a minister in the Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison governments, was a key mentor of the South Australian premier, Steven Marshall, and is often credited with helping his rapid rise to the leadership within three years of entering state parliament in 2010. Patrick, a South Australian senator, said he did not believe Pyne\u2019s engagement would conflict with the ministerial code of conduct, but it was an \u201coffensive\u201d use of his political connections. \u201cIt is offensive that he needs to be engaged to convince the South Australian government as to the merits of that particular proposal,\u201d Patrick told Guardian Australia. \u201cIt should not be necessary in Australia that anyone should have to engage someone like Pyne to get access and to advocate their issues \u2013 that is not how democracy is supposed to work in this country. \u201cI just think it is all very, very cosy and it is offensive that a former politician profits on the basis of that cosiness.\u201d Transparency International Australia said the engagement of Pyne\u2019s firm showed again how \u201cpowerful and influential lobbyists have become in shaping Australia\u2019s political and policy landscape\u201d. \u201cIt puts the spotlight on undue influence and raises questions as to whether policy decisions are being made that are in the public interest,\u201d the organisation\u2019s chief executive, Serena Lillywhite, told Guardian Australia. \u201cIt shows that powerful industry groups, such as property developers, see the value in hiring well-connected former politicians to do their lobbying.\u201d Lobbying expert George Rennie, of the University of Melbourne, said former ministers held significant advantages as lobbyists. They had access to privileged information and connections to other ministers that few others would have. \u201cNot only are current ministers more likely to grant access to former ministers, but research shows that there is a greater chance that they will accede to the lobbying,\u201d Rennie said. \u201cThis sort of bias in decision-making is inevitable, but should be minimised where possible. \u201cThis gives them significant and undue sway over decisions, and is part of the reason why some countries \u2013 appropriately \u2013 prevent ministers from lobbying for up to five years.\u201d Lillywhite said it was difficult to argue any conflict of interest in situations where a minister was not lobbying in their former portfolio area. She wants to see five-year cooling-off periods preventing former ministers lobbying in related areas after they leave office. GC Advisory was engaged through a law firm, WRP, to assist five property developers on the land tax issue. Pyne told the Adelaide Advertiser the companies were added to the lobbying register as clients out of an \u201cabundance of caution\u201d. \u201cWe are proud to work with SA companies and individuals who make a great contribution to our states economy,\u201d Pyne said.",

      "bodyText": "More than 30 bullet holes told Awapu Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau a sinister tale. \u201cTheir message is that they\u2019re going to finish us off, isn\u2019t it?\u201d the village chieftan said as he examined the pockmarked sign warning outsiders to stay off the giant Amazon reserve he calls home. Brazil was only 11 days into Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s presidency when dozens of armed land-grabbers rolled up at the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau territory and cut a trail into the forest, claiming Bolsonaro\u2019s anti-indigenous rhetoric meant they would not be stopped. Eventually the intruders were repelled \u2013 but not before leaving their leaden response to the government notice cautioning trespassers against straying on to supposedly protected land. \u201cWe\u2019re scared,\u201d admitted Awapu, a 27-year-old cacique (chief) who has received death threats for speaking out against the invaders. \u201cNobody wants to die.\u201d The slow-burn assault on Brazil\u2019s indigenous lands did not begin in January with Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s far-right presidency. But Awapu, and activists across the country, say they are convinced the onslaught has intensified since Bolsonaro took power, as illegal loggers, goldminers, poachers and land-grabbers take the president\u2019s verbal offensive against such communities as a green light to act. Last week Brazil\u2019s Indigenous Missionary Council rights group denounced that 153 indigenous territories had been invaded since January \u2013 more than double last year\u2019s figure of 76 \u2013 partly blaming the surge on Bolsonaro\u2019s \u201caggressive\u201d talk. Nor does the threat come only from illegal actors such as those behind the January raid on the Wales-sized Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau reserve in Rond\u00f4nia state. Increasingly, it is coming from the government itself. In the coming days Bolsonaro is set to unveil draft legislation that would allow commercial mining in indigenous territories, something currently outlawed, despite overwhelming opposition from voters. \u201cIndians don\u2019t want to be poor landowners living on rich soils \u2013 especially the richest soils on Earth,\u201d Bolsonaro told last month\u2019s UN general assembly, boasting of the gold, diamonds, uranium, niobium and rare earths hidden beneath their reserves. \u201cNot since the dictatorship have Brazil\u2019s indigenous peoples felt as threatened as they do now,\u201d said Randolfe Rodrigues, a progressive senator from Amap\u00e1, another of the Amazon\u2019s nine states. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not just threats. It is concrete facts,\u201d added Rodrigues, highlighting attacks on Amap\u00e1\u2019s Wai\u00e3pi indigenous community and the recent murder of an activist fighting to protect the territory sheltering Brazil\u2019s largest concentration of uncontacted tribes. F\u00e1tima Cleide, a prominent Workers\u2019 party (PT) politician in Rond\u00f4nia, said indigenous communities stood at a historic and perilous juncture. \u201cThis is a war for survival \u2026 What they want is for the indigenous peoples to disappear.\u201d Bolsonaro allies celebrate his Amazonian blueprint and brand critics foreign conspirators. Marcos Rocha, Rond\u00f4nia\u2019s Bolsonarista governor, claimed opening supposedly impoverished indigenous communities to mining would bring \u201cdignity\u201d. \u201cIndians want to grow and to develop, just like any human being. Most other countries have decimated their Indians. We want them to walk alongside us \u2013 because they are Brazilians, just like us,\u201d he said. The Bolsonarian congressman Jo\u00e3o Chris\u00f3stomo compared his leader\u2019s plans to the creation of casinos on Native American reservations in the United States. \u201cToday all the Indians there are super-millionaires,\u201d Chris\u00f3stomo claimed, laughing. But many fear Bolsonaro\u2019s moves could prove catastrophic for small and already fragile communities such as the 150-strong Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau \u2013 a semi-nomadic, Tupi-speaking group which remained uncontacted until 1981 and whose members were once called the Bocas Pretas (Black Mouths) for their distinctive tattoos made with the juice of the genipap tree. \u201cThe government\u2019s attitude towards indigenous people is the same attitude the Portuguese had when they first came to Brazil: to enslave, to colonize and to acculturate \u2013 to destroy their cultures,\u201d claimed Rodrigues. \u201cBolsonaro is a president who governs with the mindset of a Portuguese mercenary who arrived here in the 16th century.\u201d The head of the Indigenous Missionary Council, Roque Paloschi, said his group was not opposed to progress, per se: \u201cBut what kind of progress \u2013 and for whom?\u201d Brazil\u2019s indigenous peoples \u2013 who numbered upwards of 3.5 million when Portuguese explorers arrived in 1500 \u2013 suffered a wretched start to the 20th century.

On the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau reserve \u2013 and indigenous territories across Brazil \u2013 despair is spurring action. On a recent afternoon, two village leaders emerged from the rainforest, carrying rifles and drenched in sweat after a day tracking illegal loggers into the jungle. \u201cAll we heard was the din of the chainsaw. We didn\u2019t see them,\u201d said one of the pair, 33-year-old Ari Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau, showing off a smartphone video of the scene.

As the Coalition seeks the support of the Senate to drug test 5,000 people on Newstart and Youth Allowance in three trial sites, health and drug treatment experts lashed the proposal at a hearing in Canberra on Wednesday, arguing the government was proceeding in the face of all available evidence. \u201cThe organisations are unanimous in their opposition to this drug-testing trial,\u201d said Adrian Reynolds of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians. \u201cThis sends a clear message that our government is not listening to those with relevant expertise.\u201d The government says it has proposed a world-first trial to gather evidence of whether the mandatory testing is an effective way to tackle drug use among welfare recipients and the prime minister, Scott Morrison, has said he was personally \u201cpuzzled\u201d by the opposition to the plan. But experts say the policy would not be granted clinical trial status by universities because participants could not be seen to have given their consent to be tested. As part of the trial, Newstart applicants will be told to come into a Centrelink office for a meeting as part of their application. They will be told in person that they must agree to an on-the-spot drug test for their income support claim to proceed. \u201cThe proposed trial will not accurately test the feasibility or effectiveness of the proposed measures,\u201d Reynolds told the inquiry on Wednesday. \u201cAnd its results will be unable to scientifically inform any proposed national rollout because it is fatally flawed in its design.\u201d The trial was revived earlier this year and its passage through the Senate now hinges on the support of Jacqui Lambie, who has said she is open to the proposal but wants to see evidence that treatment services are adequate. A $10m treatment fund has been promised as part of the trial. On Wednesday senators heard from drug and alcohol experts that existing services were stretched with hundreds of thousands unable to get treatment, while social service organisations and local authorities complained that they had not been consulted about the plan. Officials from the Department of Social Services said they could not say which testing methods would be used \u2013 either urine, hair or saliva \u2013 until they had contracted third-party companies to carry out the tests. They also declined to provide the cost of the overall program, which they said was commercial-in-confidence.

The department expects 420 to 450 of the 5,000 people tested to fail the first test while 90 to 120 are expected to fail a second test across the sites at Logan in Queensland, Bankstown in New South Wales, and Mandurah in Western Australia. Those who fail a test will be placed on the Basics Card, which quarantines part of their welfare payments, while people who test positive twice will be referred to treatment. The Basics Card, which is already in place in those trial sites, is being phased out in the Northern Territory for the cashless debit card, which the government has claimed is superior. Representatives from the Workplace Drug Testing Association, which represents about 80% of the businesses that offer services in Australia, said that saliva and urine testing costs $100-$150 per person for on-site collection and initial screening and $150-$200 for laboratory testing.

      "bodyText": "Media reports blaming China for a massive data breach at the Australian National University revealed in June 2019 are speculative and \u201charmful\u201d because the university has been unable to establish the motivation and attribution for the attack, its chief has said. The ANU vice-chancellor, Brian Schmidt, made the comments to Guardian Australia on Wednesday, ahead of the release of an extensive incident report. Schmidt said the amount of personal student and staff data taken was only about one-3,000th of the 19 years\u2019 worth the university originally feared, but it was still \u201cfrustratingly\u201d no closer to understanding the motivations of the actor. Stolen data included names, addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, personal email addresses, emergency contact details, tax file numbers, payroll information, bank account details and passport details. But despite the potential for fraud and identification theft, Schmidt said the data \u201chas not been misused\u201d citing checks the university had conducted on the internet and dark web that found \u201cno evidence\u201d it had been traded, used illegally or in a manner that may harm the ANU community. The massive breach was widely attributed to China based on a Sydney Morning Herald report citing \u201csenior intelligence figures\u2019\u201d belief it was \u201cone of only a handful of countries able to carry out such a breach while remaining undetected\u201d. The ANU incident report said the malicious actor was \u201csophisticated\u201d but did not conclude whether it was a state actor or criminals. It concluded the actor had \u201cdistinct\u201d characteristics from whoever was responsible for an earlier breach in May 2018, which was also attributed by unnamed sources to China. \u201cWe have conducted a forensic investigation but we don\u2019t have the ability to attribute responsibility, even in a speculative manner,\u201d Schmidt told Guardian Australia. Schmidt added that if Australian security agencies knew who was responsible they hadn\u2019t told him and he would be \u201csurprised\u201d if they knew better than the university, which detected and self-reported the incident. Asked about reports attributing the breach to China, Schmidt replied: \u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t do anyone any good. \u201cJust saying something and everyone saying \u2018that must be true\u2019 gives a certain credence to it. We have a complex relationship globally and adding speculation to that is harmful \u2013 it doesn\u2019t make the world a better place.\u201d The report explained that in November 2018 a \u201csophisticated actor gained unauthorised access\u201d to the enterprise system domain part of ANU\u2019s network using a \u201cspear-phishing email\u201d. The email stole credentials from an employee when an email was previewed in Outlook, even though the employee did not open it or click any malicious weblinks. Schmidt said the operation was \u201cextremely sophisticated\u201d, likely taking months of planning and \u201ca team of between five to 15 people working around the clock\u201d. Over a six-week period ending in mid-December, the hackers were \u201cable to copy and steal an unknown quantity of data\u201d before they were inadvertently cut off and lost access, the report said. Schmidt said the hackers \u201cused custom-built malware and zero-day hacks to exploit unknown vulnerabilities in our system\u201d. \u201cThey dismantled their operations as they went to cover their tracks.\u201d After an unsuccessful attempt to regain access in February 2019 the ANU detected the intrusion in April 2019, triggering an incident response led by Northrop Grumman, that uncovered the data breach on 17 May. The report said it was \u201cclear from the pathway taken by the actor\u201d that the sole aim was to reach the database of payroll and student data and there was \u201cno forensic evidence to suggest the actor accessed or displayed any interest in files containing general administrative documents or research data\u201d. When the ANU went public it suggested that 19 years of data had been breached but the report said that \u2013 although the oldest data accessible was 19 years old \u2013 much less was taken, a conclusion based on \u201cduration of exfiltration activity and known, albeit incomplete, data volumes\u201d. Schmidt said he hoped the incident and the report has \u201copened everyone\u2019s eyes\u201d about cybersecurity threats. In addition to bolstering its cybersecurity defences, the ANU will rebuild its networks and is cooperating with the federal government\u2019s foreign interference cyber working group to mitigate threats. In 2020 the ANU will also open a cybersecurity operations centre, a dedicated unit operating independently of IT services, to identify and mitigate threats, including by using students\u2019 help and training students in cybersecurity.",

Faced with any decision about whether to do something potentially meaningful with any given hour or day \u2013 to nurture a relationship, create a work of art, savour a natural scene \u2013 the answer would always be: who cares?

The question at issue here isn\u2019t whether heaven exists. In <em>This Life</em> \u2013 a sweepingly ambitious synthesis of philosophy, spirituality and politics, which starts with the case for confronting mortality, and ends with the case for democratic socialism \u2013 H\u00e4gglund takes it for granted that it doesn\u2019t. Instead, his point is that we shouldn\u2019t want it to. Religious people, even if they don\u2019t believe in a literal place called heaven (\u201cwhite bean bags, 24-hour room service, fat babies with wings\u201d, to quote Alan Partridge), nonetheless believe that what truly matters most in life belongs to the realm of the eternal and divine. The result is \u201ca devaluation of our finite lives as a lower form of being\u201d. H\u00e4gglund\u2019s alternative, \u201csecular faith\u201d, insists that our finite lives are all we have \u2013 and that this finitude, far from being a cause for regret, is precisely what gives them meaning.</p> <p>His annual family holiday, in his childhood home on Sweden\u2019s wind-battered Baltic coast, is valuable because he won\u2019t be around to experience such things for ever, he argues, and because his family relationships are therefore equally fragile and transient.

And it\u2019s only from the standpoint of secular faith, H\u00e4gglund insists, that you can really care about the climate crisis at all. If our finite lives are only a means to eternal salvation, the destruction of life can\u2019t matter in a truly ultimate sense.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Dawkins's career in evolutionary biology might stand as an exemplar of the kind of life H\u00e4gglund urges us to live</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There\u2019s a glaring problem with all this as a critique of religion, which is that religious believers manifestly do find meaning in daily life, are devoted to their relationships, and care about the fate of the planet. (H\u00e4gglund acknowledges as much, but suggests they are acting from secular faith when they do so, risking the weird conclusion that religion isn\u2019t all that religious.) A more interesting question is how far even the secular among us remain locked in the \u201ceternalist\u201d mindset, thereby inadvertently sapping our lives of meaning. Like any good rationalist, I know I\u2019m going to die, but I\u2019m not sure I really believe it; if I did, I probably wouldn\u2019t spend so much time on Twitter. In other words, I can\u2019t say that I live every moment of my life with an awareness that \u201ceverything depends on what we do with our time together\u201d. <em>This Life</em> makes a forceful case \u2013 via readings of S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, Karl Ove Knausgaard, St Augustine and CS Lewis, among many others \u2013 for keeping that truth in mind.</p> <p>Yet these lofty thoughts comprise only half its argument. The other half is political. If our finite lives are all we have, it follows that time is the basis of all value \u2013 and the best form of society is the one that maximises our freedom to use that time as we wish. Through a detailed re-examination of the writings of Karl Marx, H\u00e4gglund concludes that capitalism can never be that system, since it\u2019s committed to using whatever time surplus it generates in the service of further growth. When you sell your labour for a wage, you\u2019re selling your life \u2013 and capitalism, even if it rewards you with great wealth, will always want more of your life. For H\u00e4gglund, democratic socialism \u2013 of a kind far more radical than anything proposed by Bernie Sanders or Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 is the only way to maximise what he calls \u201cspiritual freedom\u201d: the power to devote as much of your time as possible to what matters most to you.</p> <p>This certainly sounds preferable to the politics associated with the philosopher most famously obsessed by human finitude, Martin Heidegger, who opted for nazism instead. Still, the usual objections arise: how would you prevent the bureaucratic structures necessary for implementing this freedom from making life much less free?

Would tasks like \u201cparticipating in the garbage removal in our neighbourhood on a weekly basis\u201d really become suffused, under democratic socialism, with camaraderie and meaning? But it\u2019s best not to treat the book as an election manifesto. The fundamental point is that our fleeting time together is all that counts; you can\u2019t take it with you, and our politics fails us to the extent that it has us chasing any goal other than using it for what counts.</p> <p>Maybe it goes without saying that reflections on building a meaningful secular life are absent from <em>Outgrowing God</em>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/dawkins\" title=\"\">Richard Dawkins</a>\u2019s latest fulmination against religion, this time aimed at a young adult audience. Like other luminaries of what we should probably now be calling the nearly new atheism, Dawkins\u2019s goals are demolitionary.

Since you already don\u2019t believe in \u201cJupiter or Poseidon or Thor or Venus or Cupid or Snotra or Mars or Odin or Apollo\u201d, why randomly believe in one other god, the bearded old man of the Bible? Don\u2019t you realise there\u2019s no evidence for Jesus\u2019s miracles, and not much evidence for the rest of the story? Besides, what kind of mean-spirited deity would drown almost every living thing he\u2019d created, sparing only \u201cMr and Mrs Giraffe, Mr and Mrs Elephant, Mr and Mrs Penguin and all the other couples\u201d admitted to Noah\u2019s Ark? It\u2019s possible, I suppose, that younger readers will find this less condescending than I did. It\u2019s also possible that they won\u2019t.</p> <p>Unlike H\u00e4gglund, Dawkins never explicitly addresses what it is that makes life meaningful, if the answer isn\u2019t religious faith. So it\u2019s ironic that the book\u2019s (vastly better) second half, on the evolutionary origins of life, vividly demonstrates the spirit of scientific discovery that has made life meaningful for Dawkins himself. His contagious enthusiasm renders the basics of natural selection newly astonishing; triumphs of evolution such as the way humans gestate other humans, or how starlings manage to co\u2011ordinate themselves in thousand-strong flocks, strike the reader as mind-blowing, as do other truths of biology and physics: that every glass of water you drink probably contains a molecule that passed through the bladder of Julius Caesar; or that two bullets, one fired horizontally from a rifle and the other dropped to the ground, will (assuming a vacuum) land at the very same time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/21/best-books-of-the-21st-century\">The 100 best books of the 21st century</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Who can doubt that the discoverers of this sort of knowledge took their limited time seriously, and used it well?

      "body": "<p>Meghan, Duchess of Sussex has taken the unusual decision to sue the publisher of the Mail on Sunday after the newspaper published a handwritten letter she had sent to her estranged father.</p> <p>The decision came as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/prince-harry\">Prince Harry</a> launched an extraordinary and highly personal attack on the British tabloid press and its treatment of his wife, saying he could no longer be a \u201csilent witness to her private suffering\u201d.</p> <p>Emphasising his respect for the importance of \u201cobjective, truthful reporting\u201d, he accused parts of the media of \u201cwaging campaigns against individuals with no thought to the consequences\u201d and compared the treatment of Meghan to coverage of his mother, Princess Diana.</p> <p>The duke said his \u201cdeepest fear is history repeating itself\u201d. He wrote: \u201cThere comes a point when the only thing to do is to stand up to this behaviour, because it destroys people and destroys lives. Put simply, it is bullying, which scares and silences people. We all know this isn\u2019t acceptable, at any level. We won\u2019t and can\u2019t believe in a world where there is no accountability for this.</p> <p>\u201cThough this action may not be the safe one, it is the right one \u2026 I\u2019ve seen what happens when someone I love is commoditised to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person.</p> <p>\u201cI lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/sep/30/the-sun-breached-guidelines-with-harry-and-meghan-story\">The Sun breached guidelines with Harry and Meghan story</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/02/put-simply-its-bullying-prince-harrys-full-statement-on-the-media\">The statement</a>, issued on the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u2019s official website on Tuesday, was published as Meghan moved to start proceedings in the high court over the misuse of private information, infringement of copyright and breach of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p> <p>The Guardian reported this year that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/23/duchess-of-sussex-threatens-to-sue-mail-on-sunday-over-letter-to-father\">the Mail on Sunday was being threatened with legal action</a> because the authors of letters retain ownership of the copyright even after the physical correspondence is in the possession of another individual. Pursuing legal action on this narrow basis also gives the royals a greater chance of success against DMG Media, formerly Associated Newspapers, which also owns the Daily Mail and MailOnline \u2013 both of which have run a substantial number of stories about Meghan.</p> <p>The Mail on Sunday has run multiple embarrassing stories involving the duchess\u2019s father, Thomas Markle, including staged paparazzi photographs of him visiting an internet cafe to read about his daughter\u2019s engagement to the prince.</p> <p>Other critical coverage of the couple has ranged from their use of private jets to their refusal to allow media coverage of the christening of their baby son Archie or name his godparents. They have also been criticised for the \u00a32.4m cost to the public purse for renovations at their Windsor home, Frogmore Cottage.</p> <p>However, the royals have limited ability to stop the publication of such stories, prompting the decision to focus on the publication of Meghan\u2019s letter to her father.</p> <p>The photographs of the letter remain available on MailOnline. A spokesman for the newspaper stood by its reporting, setting up a potential court showdown: \u201cThe Mail on Sunday stands by the story it published and will be defending this case vigorously. Specifically, we categorically deny that the Duchess\u2019s letter was edited in any way that changed its meaning.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/meghan-duchess-of-sussex\">Meghan</a> and Harry, who are on a 10-day tour of southern Africa, have employed the libel lawyers Schillings, using private funds to bring the case.</p> <p>In his statement, Harry emphasised that he and Meghan believed in \u201cmedia freedom and objective, truthful reporting\u201d as a \u201ccornerstone of democracy\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a human cost to this relentless propaganda, specifically when it is knowingly false and malicious, and though we have continued to put on a brave face \u2013 as so many of you can relate to \u2013 I cannot begin to describe how painful it has been.</p> <p>\u201cBecause in today\u2019s digital age, press fabrications are repurposed as truth across the globe.

      "bodyText": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex has taken the unusual decision to sue the publisher of the Mail on Sunday after the newspaper published a handwritten letter she had sent to her estranged father. The decision came as Prince Harry launched an extraordinary and highly personal attack on the British tabloid press and its treatment of his wife, saying he could no longer be a \u201csilent witness to her private suffering\u201d. Emphasising his respect for the importance of \u201cobjective, truthful reporting\u201d, he accused parts of the media of \u201cwaging campaigns against individuals with no thought to the consequences\u201d and compared the treatment of Meghan to coverage of his mother, Princess Diana. The duke said his \u201cdeepest fear is history repeating itself\u201d. He wrote: \u201cThere comes a point when the only thing to do is to stand up to this behaviour, because it destroys people and destroys lives. Put simply, it is bullying, which scares and silences people. We all know this isn\u2019t acceptable, at any level. We won\u2019t and can\u2019t believe in a world where there is no accountability for this. \u201cThough this action may not be the safe one, it is the right one \u2026 I\u2019ve seen what happens when someone I love is commoditised to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person. \u201cI lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.\u201d The statement, issued on the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u2019s official website on Tuesday, was published as Meghan moved to start proceedings in the high court over the misuse of private information, infringement of copyright and breach of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The Guardian reported this year that the Mail on Sunday was being threatened with legal action because the authors of letters retain ownership of the copyright even after the physical correspondence is in the possession of another individual. Pursuing legal action on this narrow basis also gives the royals a greater chance of success against DMG Media, formerly Associated Newspapers, which also owns the Daily Mail and MailOnline \u2013 both of which have run a substantial number of stories about Meghan. The Mail on Sunday has run multiple embarrassing stories involving the duchess\u2019s father, Thomas Markle, including staged paparazzi photographs of him visiting an internet cafe to read about his daughter\u2019s engagement to the prince. Other critical coverage of the couple has ranged from their use of private jets to their refusal to allow media coverage of the christening of their baby son Archie or name his godparents. They have also been criticised for the \u00a32.4m cost to the public purse for renovations at their Windsor home, Frogmore Cottage. However, the royals have limited ability to stop the publication of such stories, prompting the decision to focus on the publication of Meghan\u2019s letter to her father. The photographs of the letter remain available on MailOnline. A spokesman for the newspaper stood by its reporting, setting up a potential court showdown: \u201cThe Mail on Sunday stands by the story it published and will be defending this case vigorously. Specifically, we categorically deny that the Duchess\u2019s letter was edited in any way that changed its meaning.\u201d Meghan and Harry, who are on a 10-day tour of southern Africa, have employed the libel lawyers Schillings, using private funds to bring the case. In his statement, Harry emphasised that he and Meghan believed in \u201cmedia freedom and objective, truthful reporting\u201d as a \u201ccornerstone of democracy\u201d. \u201cThere is a human cost to this relentless propaganda, specifically when it is knowingly false and malicious, and though we have continued to put on a brave face \u2013 as so many of you can relate to \u2013 I cannot begin to describe how painful it has been. \u201cBecause in today\u2019s digital age, press fabrications are repurposed as truth across the globe. One day\u2019s coverage is no longer tomorrow\u2019s chip-paper. \u201cI have been a silent witness to her private suffering for too long. To stand back and do nothing would be contrary to everything we believe in.\u201d The statement is unprecedented in the scale of its attack on the media, although it is far from the first time Harry has taken on the press. When news of his relationship with Meghan Markle became public, he criticised \u201cracial overtones\u201d in reporting. Last week, it emerged he had complained to the BBC for broadcasting and publishing online an image from a neo-Nazi social media site that called him a \u201crace traitor\u201d and depicted the royal with a gun pointed at his head. Although the BBC internally and the broadcasting watchdog Ofcom rejected the complaint, ruling that the use of the image in a report about the activities of the group was in the public interest, the BBC did apologise for not warning the duke in advance. His latest statement accused the British tabloid press of waging a \u201cruthless\u201d campaign against Meghan that had \u201cescalated over the past year, throughout her pregnancy and while raising our newborn son\u201d. Harry, said the recent positive coverage of their African tour exposed \u201cthe double standards of this specific press pack that has vilified her almost daily for the past nine months; they have been able to create lie after lie at her expense simply because she has not been visible while on maternity leave\u201d. \u201cShe is the same woman she was a year ago on our wedding day, just as she is the same woman you\u2019ve seen on this Africa tour. \u201cFor these select media, this is a game and one we have been unwilling to play from the start.\u201d A legal spokesperson for Schillings said: \u201cWe have initiated legal proceedings against the Mail on Sunday, and its parent company Associated Newspapers, over the intrusive and unlawful publication of a private letter written by the Duchess of Sussex, which is part of a campaign by this media group to publish false and deliberately derogatory stories about her, as well as her husband. \u201cGiven the refusal of Associated Newspapers to resolve this issue satisfactorily, we have issued proceedings to redress this breach of privacy, infringement of copyright and the aforementioned media agenda.\u201d",

As a cognitive neuroscientist, Baron-Cohen has helped focus attention, from his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2017/jan/23/sally-anne-task-psychological-experiment-post-truth-false-beliefs\">pioneering psychological studies</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/nov/13/autism-first-child-growing-up\">(autism was first diagnosed in the 1960s in the UK)</a> to founding the UK\u2019s first diagnosis clinic for people with Asperger syndrome in Cambridge 20 years ago with charitable funding (today the centre is NHS-run). </p> <p>Yet <a href=\"https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/autistic-adults-experience-high-rates-of-negative-life-events\" title=\"\">his latest </a><a href=\"https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/autistic-adults-experience-high-rates-of-negative-life-events\" title=\"\">research</a> reflects how improved awareness and understanding of autism have not led to improvements in the lives of people with autism. In the study exploring how autistic adults experience disproportionately more \u201cnegative life events\u201d, 45% of the 426 participants say they often lack money to meet basic needs (compared with 25% of non-autistic people) and 20% have been sexually abused by a partner (compared with 9%). The research, involving questionnaires created with autistic people, suggests why those with autism may experience more depression.</p> <p>These findings add more weight to existing evidence about the significant challenges facing autistic people. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jul/18/autistic-people-wait-years-for-diagnosis-in-some-parts-of-england\" title=\"\">Diagnosis can take years</a>; children <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/may/07/cuts-heads-refuse-school-places-pupils-special-needs\" title=\"\">face cuts to special educational needs provision</a>; <a href=\"https://www.autism.org.uk/get-involved/media-centre/news/2016-10-27-employment-gap.aspx\" title=\"\">just 16% of autistic people had jobs</a> in 2016 (compared with 80% of non-autistic people); and they are among those <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/16/rehab-centre-learning-disabilities-secure-units-community\" title=\"\">locked up in secure hospital-style units</a> instead of living in communities.

And, despite our research flagging up suicide risk and other kinds of vulnerability, too many autistic people are languishing unsupported because there\u2019s no new money in social care for autism. This is unacceptable,\u201d says Baron-Cohen. </p> <p>He hopes his centre\u2019s recent findings will encourage better practical help, such as a lifelong support worker, \u201cso there\u2019s a pathway from discovery in the lab through to changing people\u2019s lives\u201d.He says: \u201cThe old style of doing research was, without [us] realising it, arrogant, in that the scientists thought up the questions and then did it. The new way is to involve people from the outset \u2026 to codesign the studies, and check the relevance and wording.\u201d Gaps between research and practice influenced plans for a \u00a335m <a href=\"https://www.autismresearchtrust.org/what-is-the-ace\" title=\"\">Autism Centre of Excellence</a> by 2025. Aiming to be the UK\u2019s first national clinical and research centre for autistic people, it will combine academic expertise with practical help.

She was sent to an institution aged two (common advice from doctors at the time). Later in life, he moved her to supported housing near his own home. She died in 2014. In an emotive eulogy, he recalled of his sister: \u201cOur lives were richer for having shared the journey with her.\u201d He talks movingly of her and how she influenced his work. \u201cMaybe because I had a sister with a disability I was already sensitised to and fascinated by people who think or develop differently,\u201d he says.</p> <p>He has won national and international awards for researching the biological, hormonal and genetic factors in autism.

      "bodyText": "As a graduate in the 1980s, Simon Baron\u2011Cohen taught autistic children at a special school in London. Little was known about autism then, and people often misheard him, assuming he taught \u201cartistic children\u201d. \u201cPeople would be ashamed if they had an autistic child, or ashamed of saying, \u2018I am autistic\u2019, whereas now it\u2019s treated as more ordinary and there\u2019s less judgment,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the 1980s, autism was seen as categorical, so \u2018you either have it or you don\u2019t\u2019 \u2026 nowadays, we talk about a spectrum.\u201d Today, Baron-Cohen, 61, is a world expert on autism, a Cambridge professor and director of the university\u2019s influential Autism Research Centre. There is also greater awareness of autism, a lifelong condition affecting how people interact or process information. Estimates suggest one in every 100 people is on the autism spectrum (700,000 adults and children), from those with severe developmental disabilities needing intense support, to those with milder traits. Well-known autistic people include campaigner Greta Thunberg (who calls her \u201cdifference\u201d a superpower). As a cognitive neuroscientist, Baron-Cohen has helped focus attention, from his pioneering psychological studies (autism was first diagnosed in the 1960s in the UK) to founding the UK\u2019s first diagnosis clinic for people with Asperger syndrome in Cambridge 20 years ago with charitable funding (today the centre is NHS-run). Yet his latest research reflects how improved awareness and understanding of autism have not led to improvements in the lives of people with autism. In the study exploring how autistic adults experience disproportionately more \u201cnegative life events\u201d, 45% of the 426 participants say they often lack money to meet basic needs (compared with 25% of non-autistic people) and 20% have been sexually abused by a partner (compared with 9%). The research, involving questionnaires created with autistic people, suggests why those with autism may experience more depression. These findings add more weight to existing evidence about the significant challenges facing autistic people. Diagnosis can take years; children face cuts to special educational needs provision; just 16% of autistic people had jobs in 2016 (compared with 80% of non-autistic people); and they are among those locked up in secure hospital-style units instead of living in communities. The Autism Act a decade ago obliged the government to create a strategy to improve support, but legislation has fallen short of promises. \u201cMany autistic people and their families will tell you that while the [government\u2019s] autism strategy has raised awareness, nothing much has changed on the ground in the last 10 years. And, despite our research flagging up suicide risk and other kinds of vulnerability, too many autistic people are languishing unsupported because there\u2019s no new money in social care for autism. This is unacceptable,\u201d says Baron-Cohen. He hopes his centre\u2019s recent findings will encourage better practical help, such as a lifelong support worker, \u201cso there\u2019s a pathway from discovery in the lab through to changing people\u2019s lives\u201d.He says: \u201cThe old style of doing research was, without [us] realising it, arrogant, in that the scientists thought up the questions and then did it. The new way is to involve people from the outset \u2026 to codesign the studies, and check the relevance and wording.\u201d Gaps between research and practice influenced plans for a \u00a335m Autism Centre of Excellence by 2025. Aiming to be the UK\u2019s first national clinical and research centre for autistic people, it will combine academic expertise with practical help. In theory, children or adults referred by a GP would get a diagnosis, then immediate support from specialists like psychiatrists, employment or benefits advisers. \u201cLocally, we\u2019ve got this research centre and world-famous university, and all around it people are sitting on waiting lists, unable to be seen, and they\u2019re struggling, so it\u2019s about closing that gap,\u201d he explains. Baron-Cohen\u2019s late sister, Suzie, had severe learning disabilities. She was sent to an institution aged two (common advice from doctors at the time). Later in life, he moved her to supported housing near his own home. She died in 2014. In an emotive eulogy, he recalled of his sister: \u201cOur lives were richer for having shared the journey with her.\u201d He talks movingly of her and how she influenced his work. \u201cMaybe because I had a sister with a disability I was already sensitised to and fascinated by people who think or develop differently,\u201d he says. He has won national and international awards for researching the biological, hormonal and genetic factors in autism. Yet Baron-Cohen\u2019s theories remain controversial. The extreme male brain concept, outlined in his provocative book, The Essential Difference, describes men\u2019s brains being wired for systemising and women\u2019s for empathising. This led to criticisms of \u201cneurosexism\u201d and gender stereotyping, which could risk misdiagnosing or underdiagnosing autistic women, and also of fuelling the idea that people with autism have no cognitive empathy. In his defence, he stresses that \u201cequality between the sexes is very important\u201d, adding that his research explores groups of males and females \u201con average\u201d, adding \u201cthis is not about individuals\u201d. With empathy, he argues that while autistic people may struggle to imagine others\u2019 emotions, they feel emotion if others are upset (the distinction between cognitive and affective empathy). In future, he hopes the idea of neurodiversity becomes more mainstream. \u201cBrains come in different types and they\u2019re all normal,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat we want is that one day every workplace will be diverse \u2013 we already encourage that with gender and ethnicity, but the next frontier is neurodiversity and it will become ordinary.

In 2018 the House homeland security committee <a href=\"https://www.hsdl.org/?view&amp;did=805450\">counted</a> 79 fusion centers around the country.</p> <p>In its own <a href=\"https://nfcausa.org/files/DDF/OR%20TITAN%20Fusion%20Center%20Privacy%20Policy_FINAL_17FEB2011.pdf\">materials</a>, the Titan Fusion Center is described as \u201ca collaborative effort of state and federal law enforcement agencies\u201d, focused on \u201cterrorism, organized crime and gang-related criminal activity\u201d.</p> <p>The center also says that it \u201cmay retain protected information that is based on a level of suspicion that is less than \u2018reasonable suspicion\u2019, such as tips and leads or suspicious activity report (SAR) information\u201d.</p> <p>National fusion center materials <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Fusion%20Centers%20Handout_0.pdf\">say</a> that they \u201creceive information from a variety of sources, including suspicious activity reporting (SAR) information from stakeholders within their jurisdictions, as well as federal information and intelligence\u201d.</p> <p>The center also says that it \u201cwill not seek or retain information about an individual or organization solely on the basis of their religious, political, racial, or social views or activities; their participation in a particular non-criminal organization or lawful event\u201d.</p> <p>The center states that its activities are governed by Oregon statutes that prevent the gathering of \u201cinformation about the political, religious or social views, associations or activities of any individual, group, association, organization, corporation, business or partnership unless such information directly relates to an investigation of criminal activities\u201d.</p> <p>But it is precisely such statutes that observers like the ACLU of Oregon say that SWOJTF, and the fusion center, are breaking.</p> <p>Kelly Simon, an ACLU of Oregon staff attorney, said: \u201cThese communications are just more evidence of the Coos county sheriff\u2019s and Titan Fusion Center\u2019s utter disregard for the bedrock principle of freedom of expression and of Oregon\u2019s anti-profiling laws\u201d.</p> <p>National and local environmental leaders agree.</p> <p>Meanwhile, 45 leaders from international, national and Oregon-based organizations sent a letter to Governor Kate Brown on 26 September calling on her to withdraw the state\u2019s cooperation with any surveillance of activists, citing the Guardian\u2019s reporting on the SWOJTF last month. Prominent activists, including Bill McKibben, the founder of 350.org, argued that \u201cmonitoring and compiling information about Oregonians\u2019 political or social views, activities, or associations violates Oregon law\u201d, and ask that the governor \u201cprotect the civil liberties of your constituents by withdrawing all Oregon resources and participation in the SWOJTF immediately\u201d.</p> <p>University of Southern Maine criminologist Brendan McQuade, the author of a <a href=\"https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520299757/pacifying-the-homeland\">recent book</a> on fusion centers, says fusion centers and other law enforcement taskforces frequently help law agencies get around laws like the one in Oregon.</p> <p>\u201cThe structure allows the police to take advantage of the unevenness of the laws in different jurisdictions, by utilizing the differing powers afforded to state, local and federal agencies as part of a flexible overall operation,\u201d McQuade said.</p> <p>Chuck Cogburn, the analyst, did not respond to emailed questions from the Guardian, but his LinkedIn page lists his duties as: \u201cSupport Fusion Center operations. Provide analytical support. Produced risk, threat, vulnerability assessment.\u201d</p> <p>At the state level, the center falls under the purview of the Oregon department of justice (DoJ). A DoJ spokesperson did not respond to a detailed request for comment on adding the Medford protest to a SAR, or on the composition of the taskforce. Asked about passing on information from a private firm about the Klamath Falls protest to CCSO, the spokesperson said, \u201cMr Cogburn forwarded on a notice for an advertised event. It was public information, so it was not considered confidential material.\u201d</p> <p>The Titan Fusion Center has <a href=\"https://www.bendbulletin.com/localstate/politics/4218062-151/aclu-slams-oregon-doj-for-ignoring-free-speech\">encountered criticism</a> before regarding its monitoring of left-leaning activists on social media. In 2016, a fusion center investigator allegedly violated Oregon law by using a software package, DigitalStakeOut, to monitor the head of the civil rights unit in the Oregon department of justice.</p> <p>In that instance, the investigator used DigitalStakeout to geographically isolate the source of tweets which used the #blacklivesmatter hashtag to the Oregon DoJ headquarters. The tweets had been sent by Erious Johnson, the head of the civil rights unit. Some of the tweets which put Johnson under surveillance were about the hip-hop group Public Enemy. Johnson sued the state over the surveillance, <a href=\"https://www.opb.org/news/article/oregon-civil-rights-attorney-erious-johnson-settlement/\">settling</a> in 2017.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2fc991438568a4c812dee1e6665423ffadbdbf33\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2fc991438568a4c812dee1e6665423ffadbdbf33/0_0_2750_1835/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Department of Homeland Security and several fusion centers have claimed the NoDAPL movement has been associated with a rise in \u2018environmental rights extremism\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Department of Homeland Security and several fusion centers have claimed the NoDAPL movement has been associated with a rise in \u2018environmental rights extremism\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephanie Keith/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2016, the fusion center investigator, James Williams, said that he had not been aware that Oregon law made his surveillance illegal.

In an April 2017 letter to Oregon legislators supporting a boost in Fusion Center funding, the Coos county sheriff, Craig Zanni, wrote that \u201c[t]he Oregon Titan Fusion Center has provided leadership and guidance that is facilitating the formulation of the Southwestern Oregon Joint Task Force.\u201d</p> <p>Zanni wrote in the same letter that the taskforce would \u201cbe instrumental in combating the extremist agenda in Southern Oregon\u201d.</p> <p>CCSO did not respond to a detailed request for comment about SWOJTF\u2019s relationship with the fusion center, and what the \u201cextremist agenda\u201d in southern Oregon amounts to.</p> <p>In the wake of the 2016-17 Dakota Access pipeline movement, the Department of Homeland Security and seven state fusion centers produced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/20/keystone-pipeline-protest-activism-crackdown-standing-rock\">a nationally</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/20/keystone-pipeline-protest-activism-crackdown-standing-rock\"> circulated bulletin</a> that had similarly claimed the NoDAPL movement has been associated with a <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/document/2017/12/11/may-2017-field-analysis-report/\">rise in \u201cenvironmental rights extremism\u201d.</a></p> <p>Lauren Regan, the executive director of the Civil Liberties Defense Center, said labeling of activists as \u201cextremists\u201d is part of a strategy for marginalizing them from potential supporters.</p> <p>\u201cThe use of the term \u2018extremism\u2019 is a government calling card when it intends to use repressive criminalization against a social movement,\u201d Regan added.</p>",

In another email on 7 January 2019, Cogburn describes a conversation he had with an Oregon state police detective to addressees including Valencia and the CCSO sergeant Doug Strain. Cogburn remarks that he \u201cgave him an overview of the JCLNG (Jordan Cove LNG project) since 2015\u201d, including \u201cgroups involved\u201d and \u201cprior protest activity\u201d. Later, on 22 March, Cogburn forwarded an email from a private firm providing security services for Pembina, the project\u2019s owner, to Valencia and Strain. The initial email read: \u201cThere is a protest scheduled in front of our Klamath office next Thursday from 12-2pm. The local Democrat Party dropped the poster below at the chamber office, and then joined the chamber.\u201d It then reproduced the text of a poster for a \u201cblock the pipe party\u201d protest held at a theater in Klamath Falls on 5 April. Cogburn forwarded it with the message, \u201cFYI. Not sure if you get these.\u201d The national network of fusion centers were created in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, as focal points for cooperation and information sharing between federal, state and local agencies in detecting and responding to terrorist and criminal activities. In 2018 the House homeland security committee counted 79 fusion centers around the country. In its own materials, the Titan Fusion Center is described as \u201ca collaborative effort of state and federal law enforcement agencies\u201d, focused on \u201cterrorism, organized crime and gang-related criminal activity\u201d. The center also says that it \u201cmay retain protected information that is based on a level of suspicion that is less than \u2018reasonable suspicion\u2019, such as tips and leads or suspicious activity report (SAR) information\u201d. National fusion center materials say that they \u201creceive information from a variety of sources, including suspicious activity reporting (SAR) information from stakeholders within their jurisdictions, as well as federal information and intelligence\u201d. The center also says that it \u201cwill not seek or retain information about an individual or organization solely on the basis of their religious, political, racial, or social views or activities; their participation in a particular non-criminal organization or lawful event\u201d. The center states that its activities are governed by Oregon statutes that prevent the gathering of \u201cinformation about the political, religious or social views, associations or activities of any individual, group, association, organization, corporation, business or partnership unless such information directly relates to an investigation of criminal activities\u201d. But it is precisely such statutes that observers like the ACLU of Oregon say that SWOJTF, and the fusion center, are breaking. Kelly Simon, an ACLU of Oregon staff attorney, said: \u201cThese communications are just more evidence of the Coos county sheriff\u2019s and Titan Fusion Center\u2019s utter disregard for the bedrock principle of freedom of expression and of Oregon\u2019s anti-profiling laws\u201d. National and local environmental leaders agree. Meanwhile, 45 leaders from international, national and Oregon-based organizations sent a letter to Governor Kate Brown on 26 September calling on her to withdraw the state\u2019s cooperation with any surveillance of activists, citing the Guardian\u2019s reporting on the SWOJTF last month. Prominent activists, including Bill McKibben, the founder of 350.org, argued that \u201cmonitoring and compiling information about Oregonians\u2019 political or social views, activities, or associations violates Oregon law\u201d, and ask that the governor \u201cprotect the civil liberties of your constituents by withdrawing all Oregon resources and participation in the SWOJTF immediately\u201d. University of Southern Maine criminologist Brendan McQuade, the author of a recent book on fusion centers, says fusion centers and other law enforcement taskforces frequently help law agencies get around laws like the one in Oregon. \u201cThe structure allows the police to take advantage of the unevenness of the laws in different jurisdictions, by utilizing the differing powers afforded to state, local and federal agencies as part of a flexible overall operation,\u201d McQuade said. Chuck Cogburn, the analyst, did not respond to emailed questions from the Guardian, but his LinkedIn page lists his duties as: \u201cSupport Fusion Center operations. Provide analytical support. Produced risk, threat, vulnerability assessment.\u201d At the state level, the center falls under the purview of the Oregon department of justice (DoJ). A DoJ spokesperson did not respond to a detailed request for comment on adding the Medford protest to a SAR, or on the composition of the taskforce. Asked about passing on information from a private firm about the Klamath Falls protest to CCSO, the spokesperson said, \u201cMr Cogburn forwarded on a notice for an advertised event. It was public information, so it was not considered confidential material.\u201d The Titan Fusion Center has encountered criticism before regarding its monitoring of left-leaning activists on social media. In 2016, a fusion center investigator allegedly violated Oregon law by using a software package, DigitalStakeOut, to monitor the head of the civil rights unit in the Oregon department of justice. In that instance, the investigator used DigitalStakeout to geographically isolate the source of tweets which used the #blacklivesmatter hashtag to the Oregon DoJ headquarters. The tweets had been sent by Erious Johnson, the head of the civil rights unit. Some of the tweets which put Johnson under surveillance were about the hip-hop group Public Enemy. Johnson sued the state over the surveillance, settling in 2017. In 2016, the fusion center investigator, James Williams, said that he had not been aware that Oregon law made his surveillance illegal. Reportedly, it was Cogburn who had arranged for the center to receive the trial of the software which allowed Williams to pinpoint Johnson\u2019s tweets. The CCSO spokesman, Captain Gabriel Fabrizio, has described SWOJTF as having been \u201ccreated to ensure a multi-agency approach to any and all contingencies. Coos county, due to the potential sighting [sic] of the terminal on the Coos Bay, has been conducting drills and planning regarding all hazards since Jordan Cove has made its intentions known.\u201d In fact, the fusion center appears to have played a key role in setting up the southern Oregon taskforce. In an April 2017 letter to Oregon legislators supporting a boost in Fusion Center funding, the Coos county sheriff, Craig Zanni, wrote that \u201c[t]he Oregon Titan Fusion Center has provided leadership and guidance that is facilitating the formulation of the Southwestern Oregon Joint Task Force.\u201d Zanni wrote in the same letter that the taskforce would \u201cbe instrumental in combating the extremist agenda in Southern Oregon\u201d. CCSO did not respond to a detailed request for comment about SWOJTF\u2019s relationship with the fusion center, and what the \u201cextremist agenda\u201d in southern Oregon amounts to. In the wake of the 2016-17 Dakota Access pipeline movement, the Department of Homeland Security and seven state fusion centers produced a nationally circulated bulletin that had similarly claimed the NoDAPL movement has been associated with a rise in \u201cenvironmental rights extremism\u201d. Lauren Regan, the executive director of the Civil Liberties Defense Center, said labeling of activists as \u201cextremists\u201d is part of a strategy for marginalizing them from potential supporters. \u201cThe use of the term \u2018extremism\u2019 is a government calling card when it intends to use repressive criminalization against a social movement,\u201d Regan added.",

Bottom left and right: Riders ascend hills by hooking on to passing lorries His mother, Jessica, speaks for much of the community. \u201cThey are fools the way they hurtle down the highways,\u201d she says in her ramshackle single-room home overlooking the city. \u201cJust look how many scars they all have.\u201d The pastime has exposed fault lines in the neighbourhood where crime and unemployment are rampant. Criminal gangs and drug traffickers control much of Medell\u00edn\u2019s slums, and Estiven Hurtado\u2019s bike was confiscated by one of their members after his crash. The gravity bike competition at the 29th car festival in Medell\u00edn, November 2018 \u201cThese kids often come from broken homes, and often fall into drug abuse,\u201d says Natalia Montoya, a psychologist at the local school. \u201cIt\u2019s a self-destructive way of escaping the reality of their lives.\u201d Three cyclists from Vallejuelos have died this year, with accidents a regular occurrence. Montoya\u2019s school, where most of the children in the neighbourhood study, engages in campaigns to encourage rider safety, donating helmets. One particular issue is the practice of pillion riders, who are at more risk due to not being in control. Lights are almost never used. \u201cIf done safely, it is a good outlet for all of the stress that they have,\u201d Montoya says. \u201cBut there is still a lot more to do.\u201d Left: Juan Pablo Morales with grazes. Right: the scene of a gravity biking accident. Riders prefer night-time as the roads are less busy, allowing them to pick up greater speed. Despite the risks, and despite regular altercations with the police who patrol the highways, it looks like gravity biking is here to stay. As night falls, one group of riders waits at the roadside for a truck to latch on to. Among them is Juan Pablo Morales, who just a week earlier fell from his bike, badly grazing his face and chin. The accident has done little to dissuade him. \u201cIt\u2019s not the first and it\u2019s not the last,\u201d he says, grinning broadly. \u201cIt\u2019ll take the most serious accident possible to stop me.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter",

After a long song-and-dance prologue (featuring Nat King Cole on banjo), we\u2019re brought to an eye-popping title card program printed on neon-colored paper and laid out in gorgeous Old West typography.</p> <p>The influence of this sequence can be seen in films as recent as Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse, which gives the sequence a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Vhlohau6M74\">direct shout-out</a> during its own kitchen-sink opening, and The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, which uses a similar meta-narrative framing device.</p> <h2><strong>Bonnie and Clyde (1967)</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siEe6NWDfJU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/siEe6NWDfJU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The year 1967 is considered one of the most important in movie history, the moment it became obvious the studio system was beyond salvaging and a changing of the guard was inevitable. Fitzgerald was front and center for this transition, having designed the titles for four<em> </em>of that year\u2019s five best picture nominees: two Sidney Poitier social dramas, Guess Who\u2019s Coming to Dinner and In the Heat of the Night (the night\u2019s big winner), as well as New Hollywood game-changers The Graduate and Bonnie and Clyde.</p> <p>Of the latter films, The Graduate contains arguably the more memorable title sequence, but Bonnie and Clyde lays claim to this spot for two reasons. First, its Depression-era photo montage displays Fitzgerald\u2019s penchant for dramatic layering just as well as The Graduate airport fugue: the ominous report of the Brownie camera starts to sound suspiciously like gunshots as the sequence moves along, while the white title cards filling with red clue us in to the blood-drenched finale that lies in store.</p> <p>Second it was during his work on this sequence that Fitzgerald decided, at the behest of the producer and star Warren Beatty, to strike out on his own and form his own design studio, Wayne Fitzgerald FilmDesign.</p> <p><strong>The Conversation (1974)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i61lUxshSn0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/i61lUxshSn0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>It\u2019s safe to say that, of the various film-makers Fitzgerald worked with on multiple occasions (including Beatty, Roman Polanski and John Hughes), his greatest collaborator was Francis Ford Coppola. Fitzgerald did the titles for several of the director\u2019s films, including Apocalypse Now (end credits), The Outsiders, One from the Heart, The Rainmaker and The Godfather: Part II and III. While it\u2019s tempting to highlight his simple, but powerful title sequence for The Godfather: Part II, The Conversation marks their finest partnership.</p> <p>There\u2019s a strong case to be made that The Conversation is Coppola\u2019s greatest film, and a large part of that argument rests on the masterful opening shot: the slow-zoom into a public San Francisco park from high above, a cacophony of sounds overwhelming our auditory receptors, the sharp white of the corner-set titles cutting against the long shadows cast by the surround trees and architecture. It all combines to build a mood of quiet dread that hangs over the rest of the film like fog from off the Bay.</p> <h2><strong>Murder by Death (1976)</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=680eag-EUms\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/680eag-EUms?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Fitzgerald\u2019s filmography is filled with sequences boasting ambitious art design, but in terms of pure creativity and originality, nothing quite tops this bit of pop-up animation for which he teamed with the Addams Family creator Charles Addams.</p> <p>The sequence gleefully lays out the grisly parlor games to follow, succeeding not only in introducing us (in \u201cdiabolical order\u201d) to the cast, but also clueing us in to their characters\u2019 personalities and potential motives.</p> <p>It\u2019s as good \u2013 and arguably better \u2013 than anything that follows, and one hopes that the resurgence of whodunnits we\u2019re currently witnessing eventually produces a title sequence as fun and rewatchable as this.</p> <h2><strong>The Domino Principle (1977)</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGHDqnVTWfA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RGHDqnVTWfA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>This espionage thriller, directed by Stanley Kramer and starring Gene Hackman and Candice Bergen, may have faded into obscurity following its release, but if nothing else, it deserves to be remembered for Fitzgerald\u2019s startling and powerful title sequence.</p> <p>The whole thing is sadly mournful and subtly menacing, conveying to us everything we need to know about the film\u2019s hero and his predicament \u2013 how the walls have been closing in on him his whole life and how the future is always something just out of reach. The moment when the dominoes explode in slow motion, revealing a haggard and coldly smoldering Hackman behind bars, is a cut for the ages.</p> <h2><strong>9 to 5 (1980)</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6okRayU0UFA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6okRayU0UFA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>One recurring motif throughout Fitzgerald\u2019s title sequences is the close study of crowds, particularly the way human bodies maneuver within them.

(Yes, yes, the Ain\u2019t to Proud to Beg dance scene, I suppose).</p> <p>Along with the above-mentioned entry, this sequence established Fitzgerald as the best in the game when it came to setting a title sequence to pop music.</p> <h2><strong>National Lampoon\u2019s European Vacation (1985)</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-ON-HLRlFg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2-ON-HLRlFg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>As fun as Fitzgerald\u2019s title sequence for the first Vacation movie was, its eclectic use of colorful postcards a triumph of art design, his work on 1985\u2019s sequel is even better.</p> <p>Set once more to the head-bopping sounds of Lindsey Buckingham\u2019s Holiday Road, the use of passports title cards is ultra-inspired, while the sped-up editing and various sight and sound gags perfectly convey the silly and clever irreverence viewers had come to expect from the National Lampoon brand.</p> <h2>City Slickers (1991)</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KAbYc6YrLQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4KAbYc6YrLQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Speaking of silly, clever irreverence, we\u2019ll close out with this utterly gleeful cartoon title sequence from Billy Crystal\u2019s slapstick smash hit.

      "bodyText": "This Monday marked the death of main title designer Wayne Fitzgerald at the age of 89. One of the great movie and television craftsmen of the past half century, if you don\u2019t recognize Fitzgerald by name, you\u2019re probably still familiar with his body of work, which included a filmography boasting more than 450 credits and which earned him three Emmys over the course of his career. Alongside the likes of Saul and Elaine Bass, Dan Peri and Pablo Ferro, Fitzgerald turned the craft of title design \u2013 so often taken for granted \u2013 into an art form unto itself. The full measure of Fitzgerald\u2019s legacy is too large to cover all at once, but the following examples should provide a broad overview of his nearly 60-year career. In honor of his passing, here are 10 of William Fitzgerald\u2019s best and most memorable title sequences in film: Pillow Talk (1959) The first film to pair Rock Hudson and Doris Day, this bright, peppy, clever battle-of-the-sexes comedy opens with an equally bright, peppy, clever title sequence. A man and woman lounge in separate beds on either side of a room, kicking up their feet and tossing pillows up and down and over at one another, all while the credits are projected, in perfect symmetry, against the room\u2019s center divider. This sequence perfectly captures the sly sex appeal and carefree tone that made the Hudson-Day films such big hits at the time, and which lends them their charming mid-century appeal today. Cat Ballou (1965) Another splash of colorful nostalgia, the opening title sequence of this western musical comedy is staked with surprises, starting with the transformation of the Columbia Pictures torchbearer into a fiery, pistol-popping Jane Fonda. After a long song-and-dance prologue (featuring Nat King Cole on banjo), we\u2019re brought to an eye-popping title card program printed on neon-colored paper and laid out in gorgeous Old West typography. The influence of this sequence can be seen in films as recent as Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse, which gives the sequence a direct shout-out during its own kitchen-sink opening, and The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, which uses a similar meta-narrative framing device. Bonnie and Clyde (1967) The year 1967 is considered one of the most important in movie history, the moment it became obvious the studio system was beyond salvaging and a changing of the guard was inevitable. Fitzgerald was front and center for this transition, having designed the titles for four of that year\u2019s five best picture nominees: two Sidney Poitier social dramas, Guess Who\u2019s Coming to Dinner and In the Heat of the Night (the night\u2019s big winner), as well as New Hollywood game-changers The Graduate and Bonnie and Clyde. Of the latter films, The Graduate contains arguably the more memorable title sequence, but Bonnie and Clyde lays claim to this spot for two reasons. First, its Depression-era photo montage displays Fitzgerald\u2019s penchant for dramatic layering just as well as The Graduate airport fugue: the ominous report of the Brownie camera starts to sound suspiciously like gunshots as the sequence moves along, while the white title cards filling with red clue us in to the blood-drenched finale that lies in store. Second it was during his work on this sequence that Fitzgerald decided, at the behest of the producer and star Warren Beatty, to strike out on his own and form his own design studio, Wayne Fitzgerald FilmDesign. The Conversation (1974) It\u2019s safe to say that, of the various film-makers Fitzgerald worked with on multiple occasions (including Beatty, Roman Polanski and John Hughes), his greatest collaborator was Francis Ford Coppola. Fitzgerald did the titles for several of the director\u2019s films, including Apocalypse Now (end credits), The Outsiders, One from the Heart, The Rainmaker and The Godfather: Part II and III. While it\u2019s tempting to highlight his simple, but powerful title sequence for The Godfather: Part II, The Conversation marks their finest partnership. There\u2019s a strong case to be made that The Conversation is Coppola\u2019s greatest film, and a large part of that argument rests on the masterful opening shot: the slow-zoom into a public San Francisco park from high above, a cacophony of sounds overwhelming our auditory receptors, the sharp white of the corner-set titles cutting against the long shadows cast by the surround trees and architecture. It all combines to build a mood of quiet dread that hangs over the rest of the film like fog from off the Bay. Murder by Death (1976) Fitzgerald\u2019s filmography is filled with sequences boasting ambitious art design, but in terms of pure creativity and originality, nothing quite tops this bit of pop-up animation for which he teamed with the Addams Family creator Charles Addams. The sequence gleefully lays out the grisly parlor games to follow, succeeding not only in introducing us (in \u201cdiabolical order\u201d) to the cast, but also clueing us in to their characters\u2019 personalities and potential motives. It\u2019s as good \u2013 and arguably better \u2013 than anything that follows, and one hopes that the resurgence of whodunnits we\u2019re currently witnessing eventually produces a title sequence as fun and rewatchable as this. The Domino Principle (1977) This espionage thriller, directed by Stanley Kramer and starring Gene Hackman and Candice Bergen, may have faded into obscurity following its release, but if nothing else, it deserves to be remembered for Fitzgerald\u2019s startling and powerful title sequence. The whole thing is sadly mournful and subtly menacing, conveying to us everything we need to know about the film\u2019s hero and his predicament \u2013 how the walls have been closing in on him his whole life and how the future is always something just out of reach. The moment when the dominoes explode in slow motion, revealing a haggard and coldly smoldering Hackman behind bars, is a cut for the ages. 9 to 5 (1980) One recurring motif throughout Fitzgerald\u2019s title sequences is the close study of crowds, particularly the way human bodies maneuver within them. His work on Sixteen Candles is a great example, but even better is the opening sequence from 1980\u2019s beloved feminist workplace comedy 9 to 5. The mix of music and motion, along with the use of clocks to move the narrative forward, make the whole thing feel like a self-contained music video, one worthy of Dolly Parton\u2019s earworm anthem. The Big Chill (1983) Speaking of the perfect mix of sound and image, is there any film more closely associated with its soundtrack than Lawrence Kasdan\u2019s boomer nostalgia drama, The Big Chill? For that matter, out of all the musical sequences in the film, is there any as instantly iconic as the opening montage set to Marvin Gaye\u2019s rendition of I Heard it Through the Grapevine? (Yes, yes, the Ain\u2019t to Proud to Beg dance scene, I suppose). Along with the above-mentioned entry, this sequence established Fitzgerald as the best in the game when it came to setting a title sequence to pop music. National Lampoon\u2019s European Vacation (1985) As fun as Fitzgerald\u2019s title sequence for the first Vacation movie was, its eclectic use of colorful postcards a triumph of art design, his work on 1985\u2019s sequel is even better. Set once more to the head-bopping sounds of Lindsey Buckingham\u2019s Holiday Road, the use of passports title cards is ultra-inspired, while the sped-up editing and various sight and sound gags perfectly convey the silly and clever irreverence viewers had come to expect from the National Lampoon brand. City Slickers (1991) Speaking of silly, clever irreverence, we\u2019ll close out with this utterly gleeful cartoon title sequence from Billy Crystal\u2019s slapstick smash hit. Drawn by Kurtz and Friends, this was the first notable animated sequence of its kind since the Pink Panther films.

      "bodyText": "A trade agreement to import produce into the European Union is set to be conditional upon animal welfare requirements for the first time. Eggs imported from Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay to member states will only be duty-free if the hens are kept in line with EU standards under the provisional terms of the new EU-Mercosur trade agreement. Previous EU free trade deals have included aspirational provisions on animal welfare, such as the 2014 EU-Ukraine association agreement, but this is the first time the elimination of tariffs have been conditional upon particular standards being upheld. Campaigning organisation Eurogroup for Animals welcomed the condition \u2013 which it hailed as \u201can important turning point in EU trade policy\u201d \u2013 but criticised the absence of a similar prerequisite for meat and egg product imports, and called for the approach to be extended. The RSPCA said the announcement that the agreement would be conditional on meeting EU animal welfare standards established \u201can important precedent\u201d and was a highly significant move. \u201cIt is the first time animal welfare standards have been incorporated into tariffs in an EU trade agreement, and something the RSPCA has been advocating for 15 years,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cWe urge the UK to do the same as it leaves the EU, by rolling over this particular trade agreement and including those welfare standard conditions in any future post-Brexit free trade agreements.\u201d The agreement was quietly made public in a meeting of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development at the European Parliament last Wednesday, after a leaked document seen by the Guardian suggested the EU had made the demand back in 2016 during the drawn-out negotiations with Mercosur. \u201cThere is a cooperation provision in the agreement on animal welfare issues with the very clear objective to improve the level of animal welfare, particularly in the Mercosur countries, to bring them up to our world leading standards,\u201d said John Clarke, director of international affairs at the European Commission\u2019s directorate-general for agriculture and rural development. \u201cFor the first time in any trade agreement, we have a condition attached to the export of eggs from Mercosur. They can only be exported at zero-duty if the Mercosur producers meet European standards for laying hens.\u201d Copa-Cogeca, a group that represents European farmers, called for greater work to be done to ensure states with bilateral trading agreements have reciprocal animal welfare standards. \u201cThis is central for us, as currently animal welfare is not a universally accepted concept amongst our trading partners,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cSome of our trading partners have committed to align their animal welfare standards with the EU, but all too often they have failed to do so.\u201d Compliance with EU laws adds 16% to the cost price of an egg, according to the European Egg Processors Association. It said the condition would help make eggs from EU producers more competitive with foreign imports. The British Egg Industry Council said that while the announcement represented \u201ca step forward\u201d it wanted to see the same animal welfare conditions apply to egg products and eggs used as ingredients in food exported to the UK. European Commission sources downplayed the significance of the trade condition and said it would not have a major impact as shelled egg imports from Mercosur countries were limited. Both sides are now preparing the final version of the trade agreement, the largest the EU has ever struck in terms of tariff reduction, before it is submitted to EU member states and the EU parliament for approval. From 2012, farmers across the EU were no longer allowed to keep hens in barren battery cages, within which movement is extremely restricted.

Whiting caught from the west of the UK should also be avoided, given that all its populations are below safe levels. Wild Atlantic halibut \u2013 an \u201camazing but endangered species\u201d \u2013 is highly vulnerable to the impact of fishing, so consumers are urged to avoid wild Atlantic halibut caught anywhere in UK waters. Among the most sustainable seafood species caught or farmed in the UK are herring (from the Irish or North Sea) where the population is in a good state, while oysters, mussels and king prawns are singled out as the tasty UK-farmed shellfish hailed as \u201creal delicacies on our doorstep\u201d. Plaice is recommended as populations are booming, as is UK-farmed Atlantic halibut, but not the endangered wild species. Following low stock levels in 2006, UK-caught European hake populations have bounced back and been consistently high over the past 10 years. \u201cWhatever the future of the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU\u201d said Coombes, \u201cshopping for sustainable UK seafood will help to support sustainable UK fishers and fish farmers and reduce the pressure on at-risk species.\u201d",

Few towns are better suited to aimless wandering.

Then there\u2019s the hospitality provided by owner Antonio Cascales and manager Juan D\u00edaz. There are only four rooms \u2013 but I can\u2019t recommend this place highly enough. Eat at Casa Machin (Calle Galindo 4), an elegant restaurant with tables in the bar. If you ask for three tapas tipicas you\u2019ll probably get salmorejo (plenty of egg, crispy chorizo, olive oil), scoops of creamy espinacas labradas (spinach, fried bread, cumin, garlic), and salty crispy fish on a slice of fresh tomato \u2013 one of the best lunches I can remember, for \u20ac14 including wine. Osuna Osuna is 35km south of \u00c9cija down the A-351, past castles and ruins, isolated cortijos, olives groves and open space. Smaller and more rural, but Osuna also has its streets of palaces \u2013 Calle San Pedro has been called one of the most beautiful in Europe, although as many people come to visit the bullring which appears in Game of Thrones (The Great Pit of Daznak in series five). And there is plenty more for fans of the otherworldly and fantastical on the town\u2019s windy hilltop. The stark old university is quite empty. The Ducal Pantheon (entry \u20ac3) beside it, however, contains the remains of several Dukes of Osuna (responsible for building almost everything around) and the guided tour is an unmissable, giddying creepy trip through underground crypts of ornate splendour. Opposite, at the Monastery de la Encarnaci\u00f3n (\u20ac3.50), ring the bell and you\u2019ll eventually be collected by a nun for a private tour of golden chapels, sacred art and treasures, culminating in a room of baby Jesuses, their collections of outfits and solid silver shoes \u2013 and then sold lottery tickets before being ushered out. Also up here is Las Canteras, the sandstone quarry dug for millennia, whose carvings and giant chambers have a distinctly Star Wars look, and an abandoned Roman necropolis, the empty graves (you can get in them if you are short) overlooked by a farmyard. One of the best places to stay is La Casona de Calder\u00f3n (doubles from \u20ac70 B&amp;B, Plaza Cervantes 16), an award-winning 17th-century hotel-museo. Operating as an inn when many writers of the romantic movement, most notably Washington Irving, were passing through, it was later a farmhouse where cheese was made, produce sold, and living space split between people and animals. Elena Calder\u00f3n inherited and lovingly restored it. Leading off a coral patio, 17 unique rooms are furnished with art and antiques (many Elena\u2019s grandmother\u2019s), with old farming artefacts exhibited throughout and named for their previous uses: La Cuadra (where cows lived), La Pajareta (the hay loft), the Cocinilla (a high-ceilinged kitchen used for pig slaughter \u2013 surprisingly romantic). Fascinating, elegant, full of warmth and charm. For tapas (average \u20ac3) try Casa Curro (Plaza Salitre 5) where about 200 options are scrawled on blackboards in the old-school bar, from quails eggs and jam\u00f3n, to pork cheek in Pedro Ximenez sherry, clams, and wild boar and the soft throat of tuna with mermelada de lim\u00f3n (a lemon marmalade). Fabulous food whipped up fresh and slapped down without fanfare. And, as you\u2019ll see from the photos on the wall, it was popular with the cast and crew of Game of Thrones too. Getting there Carmona is a 40-minute bus ride from Seville (\u20ac5 each way); \u00c9cija is an hour by bus from Cordoba or Seville (\u20ac7); Osuna has a railway station (10-15 minutes\u2019 walk from the centre) and has regular services from Seville Santa Justa station that take just over an hour (\u20ac11.50 each way). Buses to Osuna take a little longer and cost from about \u20ac5. Buses to all three towns leave from Seville\u2019s Prado de San Sebastian bus station. Looking for a holiday with a difference?

Under an agreement struck with the Democratic Unionists, Northern Ireland would keep EU single market regulations for agri-food and manufactured goods until at least 2025. After that the power-sharing authority in Stormont would decide whether to continue alignment with EU or UK standards. Johnson, who will outline the proposal to the Tory conference in Manchester today, believes the concession by the previously resistant DUP could be enough to persuade EU leaders to renegotiate Britain\u2019s withdrawal agreement before the bloc\u2019s crunch summit in two weeks\u2019 time. If he is rejected, he has pledged to go ahead with no deal despite the legal obstructions in his path. In another device that Downing Street believes could clinch a deal, a British-Irish ministerial council will allow oversight on the future regulatory regime on the island of Ireland.

Lunchtime read: How Khashoggi killing reshaped the Middle East It is one year today since Jamal Khashoggi walked into the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul hoping to finalise his divorce. Infamously, the exiled critic of the Saudi regime was never seen again. Our Middle East correspondent, Martin Chulov, says that even in a region inured to savagery, rarely has the death of one person resonated so much. He writes that the killing by Saudi hitmen has seriously damaged Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman\u2019s plans to reform the kingdom and assert its leadership over the Islamic world. Instead, his enemies, led by Iran and Turkey\u2019s Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan have become more powerful. The prince may claim the throne eventually but his ambition to rule the region appears far less certain to be fulfilled. Sport Mauricio Pochettino admitted that his Tottenham players gave up towards the end of their humiliating 7-2 Champions League defeat at home to Bayern Munich, in which former Arsenal player Serge Gnabry scored four. Raheem Sterling came off the bench to help Manchester City to a 2-0 win over Dinamo Zagreb, while Real Madrid\u2019s qualification is in the balance after being held to a 2-2 draw by Club Brugge. Britain\u2019s Adam Gemili missed out on a medal despite leading deep into the final of the 200m of the World Athletics Championships in Doha, which was won by Noah Lyles of the USA. Sebastian Coe, the IAAF president, has told athletes coached by Alberto Salazar they must sever their links with immediate effect after the American was banned for four years for \u201corchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct\u201d. Gary Kirsten will meet the England and Wales Cricket Board today to outline his vision for the men\u2019s national team and its vacant head coach position. The England defence coach, John Mitchell, has claimed Rugby World Cup officials are taking too long deliberating over decisions at the tournament and fears introducing more technology to help referees could make matters worse. And Tokyo has begun to take shape on the horizon for the sailors who became Great Britain\u2019s first athletes to be selected for next summer\u2019s Olympic Games. Business Burger King has been censured by the advertising watchdog after tweeting about selling milkshakes despite McDonald\u2019s being told to stop selling them due to the threat of customers using them to attack the Brexit party leader Nigel Farage on a trip to Scotland. A WTO warning that tariff wars threaten jobs and living standards around the world comes as financial markets in Asia took a hit overnight from the weakest manufacturing data in the US for 10 years. Stocks in Sydney and Seoul were both down more than 1%. The FTSE100 is set to open down by 0.45% while the pound is on $1.228 and \u20ac1.123. The papers One phrase dominates the front pages this morning as Boris Johnson prepares to unveil his Brexit plan. The Mail splash booms \u201cBoris: Take it or leave it\u201d, while the Express says \u201cPM\u2019s \u2018take it or leave it\u2019 Brexit deal to EU. The Metro also has \u201cTake it or leave it\u201d but the Sun boasts of an interview with the PM with the headline \u201c10 days to do deal\u201d. The Telegraph has \u201cBrexit plan revealed: PM rolls up his sleeves to send Brussels final offer\u201d and the Guardian has \u201cJohnson\u2019s threat to the EU: accept my final Brexit offer or it\u2019s no deal\u201d. The Mirror says the Tory conference is a \u201chorror show\u201d under the headline \u201cSame old Tories\u201d. The Times prefers the Duchess of Sussex story under the head \u201cfurious prince hits out at \u2018bullying\u2019 of Meghan\u201d and the FT looks abroad: \u201cHong Kong violence overshadows China\u2019s anniversary celebrations\u201d.

Diment\u2019s nomination calls her \u201ca shining example of a social conscience\u201d who is committed to ensuring the lives of elderly people are meaningful and valued, and has helped relieve the loneliness and isolation they often experience. Diment, a nurse who has worked in day care provision for 25 years, says: \u201cI\u2019m passionate about providing a service for these people who really, really wanted it.\u201d Liza Dresner, director, Resources for Autism Back in 2006, when Liza Dresner took the helm at Resources for Autism (RfA), it was a small organisation struggling financially and offering limited services in one London borough. Today, thanks to Dresner\u2019s tenacity and resilience, it is versatile and thriving, offering services throughout Greater London and the West Midlands, including 43 groups a week in termtime and 10 school holiday playschemes. Last year, 283 people received home or community support, and the charity\u2019s project helping autistic adults into volunteering roles suiting their talents and aspirations has helped 250 people, some of whom found paid employment as a result. Dresner, who began her career as a social worker with under-fives in 1982, believes continuity is key for RfA\u2019s users. \u201cWe work cradle to grave,\u201d she says. \u201cConditions like learning disability and autism are lifelong and if you don\u2019t offer some kind of lifelong service or support then you\u2019re failing families.\u201d Her nomination says her ability to listen to people with autism and their families, and adapt services to their needs, has made a real difference to their lives. Mark Fennelly, regional operations manager and head of IT, St Anne\u2019s Community Services Mark Fennelly has been working with people with learning disabilities since he was 16, when he volunteered at a hospital as part of the Duke of Edinburgh award scheme. He joined St Anne\u2019s Community Services, which provides services in the north of England for people with learning disabilities, as a nurse 27 years ago, and has risen through the ranks to become a senior manager who inspires nothing but respect and trust among his staff, according to his nomination. Fennelly says his frontline experience means he understands how hard those jobs are. The relationships he has built with commissioners are credited with ensuring services have been recommissioned year after year, giving vulnerable clients \u2013 who also include people with mental health issues and substances problems, and those who are homeless \u2013 accommodation and standards of care that allow them to live rich and fulfilling lives. Fennelly\u2019s nomination says he embodies the public service values of integrity, perseverance, spirit of service and commitment. \u201cI have this view that you should only ever deliver things you\u2019d want for yourself,\u201d he says. \u201cMy job is to have the best staff, because those that want to make a real difference give the best service to the clients.\u201d Voting for this award has closed. The winner will be announced at the Public Service Awards ceremony on 26 November 2019",

      "bodyText": "The fund management sector is facing fresh criticism over its widening gender pay gap, after a new report says there are signs of \u201cresentment\u201d from professionals who have dismissed diversity as a matter of political correctness. The average gender pay gap for the sector has increased by 0.8% to 31% since mandatory reporting was introduced in the UK two years ago. That is second only to the banking industry, where women earn about 32% less than men on average. It is the only sector among the five worst performers \u2013 which include banking, insurance, property and travel \u2013 that failed to narrow the gap, according to the report by PwC and the industry\u2019s Diversity Project group. Helena Morrissey, the chair of the group and head of personal investing at Legal &amp; General Investment Management, said the pay gap data was \u201cboth depressing and galvanising\u201d. However, she said there was no use in trying to persuade colleagues. \u201cNo amount of talk will convince this group \u2013 in fact, it is likely to be counterproductive,\u201d Morrissey said. \u201cInstead, diversity and inclusion needs to be treated just like any other business issue, featured on every strategy day agenda, in every performance review, every hiring, promotion and reward decision, every risk and culture assessment.\u201d Stalled progress across the industry, which manages investments on behalf of retail customers and bigger clients such as workplace pension funds, is partly the result of there being few women in top roles. The report found many professionals were still sceptical of evidence showing that diversity improved business performance by boosting innovation and resulting in better returns. \u201cThere are signs of \u2018diversity fatigue\u2019 and pushback,\u201d the report says. \u201cBusiness leaders may be convinced of the need to act, but too many investment professionals perceive the issue to be more about political correctness than a driver of investment performance of the long-term success of their firm. \u201cThere is resentment about special programmes designed to foster diverse talent, even where the motivation is to create the best investment teams.\u201d The report also turns the spotlight on investment management firms, which are starting to take an active stance on the diversity and sustainability policies of companies they have invested in. While the PwC report found 54% of the investment management firms tracked in the report recorded a drop in their gender pay gap last year, the margin of improvement was mostly less than 5%.",

Some have blocked streets, others have destroyed infrastructure. In the most catastrophic events, millions of cubic tons of rock have crumbled off mountains and crushed tourists. Last week in the Italian Alps, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/28/courmayeur-you-broke-our-glacier-mont-blanc-resort-climate-frontline\">authorities closed roads and evacuated residents</a> after warnings that a large part of the Planpincieux glacier was at risk of collapsing.</p> <p>For the Swiss authorities, these increasingly common rockfalls present a major challenge.

Although experts were keeping a close eye on movement on the mountain, they could not tell how bad that rockfall in August 2017 would be. One morning, the 100-plus residents of the quaint village of Bondo heard the roar. In an instant, they had to leave their belongings and flee.</p> <p>More than 3m cubic meters of rock descended from the Piz Cengalo, killing eight hikers.

Opposite her home, a car-sized rock engraved with the date of the event serves as a commemoration, one of thousands that washed down the valley that day.

      "body": "<p>Ella Daish has lost count of how many tampon pictures she has. People send them in from all over the world \u2013 plastic applicators polluting the environment, blue, orange, green, purple and yellow.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a rainbow of plastic pollution,\u201d says Daish, 27, a campaigner seeking to persuade companies and governments to remove plastics from women\u2019s sanitary products. \u201cThis is a global issue, but period products aren\u2019t talked about much; they need to be stopped at source.\u201d</p> \n<p>Sanitary products are the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/environment/circular-economy/pdf/single-use_plastics_impact_assessment.pdf\" title=\"\">fifth most common item found on Europe\u2019s beaches</a>, more widespread than single-use coffee cups, cutlery or straws. Some <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/plastics_unflushables_-_submited_evidence.pdf\" title=\"\">200,000 tonnes of material</a> is believed to end up in UK landfill every year. The water engineer Hazem Gouda has estimated that <a href=\"https://www.the-ies.org/sites/default/files/journals/water_security_oct_14.pdf\" title=\"\">700,000 panty liners, 2.5m</a> <a href=\"https://www.the-ies.org/sites/default/files/journals/water_security_oct_14.pdf\" title=\"\">tampons and 1.4m sanitary towels are flushed down the toilet every day in the UK</a>.</p> \n<p>Daish is neither the first nor the only woman taking a stand against this. But, finally, there are signs that the government and the retail industry are taking the problem seriously. Last month, Sainsbury\u2019s became the first company to stop producing plastic applicators for its own-brand tampons, removing 2.7 tonnes of plastic annually. \u201cThis move shows that people power has a huge impact. It speaks volumes,\u201d says Daish, who is putting pressure on other big names, including Procter &amp; Gamble and Boots. \u201cPlastic tampon applicators are used for seconds, yet take centuries to break down, and they have avoidable impacts on the environment.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Scottish government has also taken a stand, with a \u00a3175,200 campaign in partnership with Zero Waste Scotland to encourage women to try free samples of period pants, menstrual cups and reusable sanitary pads. In Wales, Caerphilly council has taken the decision to devote all of its period poverty funding to eco-friendly products \u2013 a UK first.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a5947407-4f95-41fe-849d-e7d9248ebcb7\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous?

Another option is the silicone menstrual cup that is inserted into the vagina to collect blood flow. Menstrual cups can be used for 10 years and cost about \u00a320 \u2013 that equates to 16p for each menstrual cycle.</p> \n<p>But there is still a lack of information comparing sanitary products. \u201cDespite the fact that 1.9 billion women globally are of menstruating age, spending on average 65 days a year dealing with menstrual blood flow, few good-quality studies exist that compare sanitary products,\u201d says Prof Penelope Phillips-Howard from the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, and the lead author of research on the subject, published in <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(19)30111-2/fulltext\" title=\"\">the Lancet Public Health</a>.</p> \n<p>Over 10 years, a menstrual cup is estimated to create 0.4% of the plastic waste generated by single-use pads and 6% of that produced by using tampons. \u201cMenstrual cups will contribute to decreasing pollution of plastic waste from monthly use of disposable sanitary products,\u201d adds Phillips-Howard who found that awareness about cups was extremely low, even though 199 brands are available in 99 countries.</p> \n<p>The Women\u2019s Environment Network (WEN), which coined the term \u201cenvironmenstrual\u201d in 2004, is noticing real momentum for change in the UK.</p> \n<p>\u201cAfter Blue Planet II, people realised the sheer scale of plastic pollution in our seas, our soil and our own bodies. Women seem happier to talk about periods \u2026 they had previously been seen as taboo,\u201d says Kate Metcalf, WEN\u2019s co-director. \u201cWe\u2019ve still got a long way to go, but it\u2019s becoming more mainstream and the Women\u2019s Institute just joined our coalition, so our reach is spreading.\u201d</p> \n<p>According to Metcalf, period education is \u201cpatchy and outdated\u201d. WEN is collaborating with the UK-based nonprofit group City to Sea, which campaigns to prevent plastic pollution at source, to create a schools programme called <a href=\"https://www.citytosea.org.uk/plasticfreeperiods/rethink-periods/\" title=\"\">Rethink Periods</a>. It is training 600 teachers across England to get the message across to adolescents.

      "bodyText": "Ella Daish has lost count of how many tampon pictures she has. People send them in from all over the world \u2013 plastic applicators polluting the environment, blue, orange, green, purple and yellow. \u201cThat\u2019s a rainbow of plastic pollution,\u201d says Daish, 27, a campaigner seeking to persuade companies and governments to remove plastics from women\u2019s sanitary products. \u201cThis is a global issue, but period products aren\u2019t talked about much; they need to be stopped at source.\u201d Sanitary products are the fifth most common item found on Europe\u2019s beaches, more widespread than single-use coffee cups, cutlery or straws. Some 200,000 tonnes of material is believed to end up in UK landfill every year. The water engineer Hazem Gouda has estimated that 700,000 panty liners, 2.5m tampons and 1.4m sanitary towels are flushed down the toilet every day in the UK. Daish is neither the first nor the only woman taking a stand against this. But, finally, there are signs that the government and the retail industry are taking the problem seriously. Last month, Sainsbury\u2019s became the first company to stop producing plastic applicators for its own-brand tampons, removing 2.7 tonnes of plastic annually. \u201cThis move shows that people power has a huge impact. It speaks volumes,\u201d says Daish, who is putting pressure on other big names, including Procter &amp; Gamble and Boots. \u201cPlastic tampon applicators are used for seconds, yet take centuries to break down, and they have avoidable impacts on the environment.\u201d The Scottish government has also taken a stand, with a \u00a3175,200 campaign in partnership with Zero Waste Scotland to encourage women to try free samples of period pants, menstrual cups and reusable sanitary pads. In Wales, Caerphilly council has taken the decision to devote all of its period poverty funding to eco-friendly products \u2013 a UK first. Alternatives are starting to catch on: there are products with cardboard applicators, as well as reusable versions and non-applicator tampons. Another option is the silicone menstrual cup that is inserted into the vagina to collect blood flow. Menstrual cups can be used for 10 years and cost about \u00a320 \u2013 that equates to 16p for each menstrual cycle. But there is still a lack of information comparing sanitary products. \u201cDespite the fact that 1.9 billion women globally are of menstruating age, spending on average 65 days a year dealing with menstrual blood flow, few good-quality studies exist that compare sanitary products,\u201d says Prof Penelope Phillips-Howard from the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, and the lead author of research on the subject, published in the Lancet Public Health. Over 10 years, a menstrual cup is estimated to create 0.4% of the plastic waste generated by single-use pads and 6% of that produced by using tampons. \u201cMenstrual cups will contribute to decreasing pollution of plastic waste from monthly use of disposable sanitary products,\u201d adds Phillips-Howard who found that awareness about cups was extremely low, even though 199 brands are available in 99 countries. The Women\u2019s Environment Network (WEN), which coined the term \u201cenvironmenstrual\u201d in 2004, is noticing real momentum for change in the UK. \u201cAfter Blue Planet II, people realised the sheer scale of plastic pollution in our seas, our soil and our own bodies. Women seem happier to talk about periods \u2026 they had previously been seen as taboo,\u201d says Kate Metcalf, WEN\u2019s co-director. \u201cWe\u2019ve still got a long way to go, but it\u2019s becoming more mainstream and the Women\u2019s Institute just joined our coalition, so our reach is spreading.\u201d According to Metcalf, period education is \u201cpatchy and outdated\u201d. WEN is collaborating with the UK-based nonprofit group City to Sea, which campaigns to prevent plastic pollution at source, to create a schools programme called Rethink Periods. It is training 600 teachers across England to get the message across to adolescents. Crucially, says the campaign\u2019s national coordinator Clare Marshall, lessons are accompanied by a free box of period pants, menstrual cups, organic cotton disposables and reusable pads, so that pupils can see and feel the products. \u201cGirls and boys are often shocked to find out that certain products contain plastic,\u201d Marshall says. \u201cThey are keen to find out what they can do, so we highlight how Ella Daish is successfully taking on the big guns; hopefully teenagers will listen up.\u201d Alec Mills, the co-founder of Dame, a company that produces the world\u2019s first reusable tampon applicator, says the onus is on government to provide sustainable menstrual products in schools. \u201cThere\u2019s a perfect storm of cultural change \u2013 people are more prepared to talk about their periods, plus there\u2019s this enormous plastic-free environmental drive,\u201d he says. \u201cFinally, women are questioning the products they are using \u2013 now is the time to create positive changes and let the concrete set on a young generation making new habits.\u201d But there is concern about the Westminster government\u2019s new Period Poverty Taskforce, co-chaired by Procter &amp; Gamble which already supplies free Always pads and Tampax tampons to school pupils. \u201cOur calculations show that it would be cheaper in the long term for government to promote reusables and plastic-free alternatives,\u201d says Ruby Raut, the founder of Wuka period pants, which can be worn for up to eight hours and then washed. \u201cThis is simply not in line with the government\u2019s call for all schools to become plastic-free by 2022.\u201d Raut, Mills and Daish joined others to sign an open letter demanding that the Department for Education offers free sustainable alternatives to girls in English secondary education.

      "bodyText": "Is Donald Trump behaving like a mafia boss? Adam Schiff, the Democratic chair of the House intelligence committee, thinks so. Schiff said the way Trump leaned on Ukraine, seeking dirt on political rival Joe Biden was a \u201cclassic, mafia-like shakedown\u201d. Many others have made the same comparison. But it doesn\u2019t take Congress or the Twittersphere to establish Trump\u2019s affinity for the mob. The real estate developer and former reality star has talked about it himself \u2013 on late-night TV. In 2013, three years before Trump\u2019s presidential victory, David Letterman asked him about it bluntly on his CBS talkshow. \u201cHave you ever knowingly done business with organized crime?\u201d the host asked. Trump grimaced, then said: \u201cI\u2019ve really tried to stay away from them as much as possible. \u201cYou know, growing up in New York and doing business in New York, I would say there might have been one of those characters along the way, but generally speaking I like to stay away from that group.\u201d Then he added: \u201cI have met on occasion a few of those people. They happen to be very nice people.\u201d Trump\u2019s characterization of New York crime families as \u201cvery nice people\u201d might surprise those at the receiving end of Gambino racketeering, Lucchese loan sharking or Bonanno fraud. Not to mention the murders. But then Trump has a habit of seeing the good in those generally deemed beyond the pale. His remark about the mafia echoes his comment after the neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia in August 2017 in which a counter-protester was killed. Then, Trump said there were \u201cvery fine people on both sides\u201d. The mafia simile is not a purely stylistic matter for Trump, whose conversation with the Ukrainian president on 25 July reads in parts like a Martin Scorsese screenplay. \u201cI would like you to do us a favor,\u201d the US president said, encouraging Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Biden and saying of his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani: \u201cI will get him to call you along with the attorney general.\u201d As Trump suggested in his Letterman interview, he has in reality crossed paths with the New York mob. For example, the late Roy Cohn, a predecessor to Giuliani as Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, had among his other clients the boss of the Genovese crime family, \u201cFat Tony\u201d Salerno, and John Gotti of the Gambinos. Trump Tower, the president\u2019s New York bunker and home on Fifth Avenue, was built in the early 1980s largely out of ready-mix concrete which at the time was controlled by Salerno and other mob leaders. Wayne Barrett, the late Village Voice reporter who was the authority on Trump\u2019s dealings, observed in his book Trump: The Deals and the Downfall that Trump\u2019s life \u201cintertwines with the underworld\u201d. Having praised the crime families as \u201cvery nice people\u201d, Trump gave Letterman a piece of advice drawn from his own extensive experience. \u201cYou just don\u2019t want to owe them money,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t owe them money.\u201d",

Doctors wrote the prescriptions. But at the front end were thousands of pharmacies dispensing the pills, and among the pharmacists were profiteers.</p> <p> </p> <h2><strong>No questions asked</strong></h2> <p>In 2001, the West Virginia bureau of criminal investigation sent Smith to investigate a surge of opioids pills on the streets. At first he planned to approach it the way he investigated marijuana: by working along the chain from the user to the dealer to the producer with the threat of jail to prise information from suspects.</p> <p>But Smith quickly discovered that users were happy to tell him where he could find doctors to write prescriptions and drug stores to fill them \u2013 no questions asked. They pointed him to Mingo county.</p> <p>Smith went and watched. Each day, hundreds of people lined up outside an old animal feed store where a group of doctors were set up by a former pimp, just out of federal prison for running a gay prostitution ring in Washington DC, to churn out opioid prescriptions faster than West Virginia\u2019s major hospitals.</p> <p>Before long, people in town were calling the Williamson Wellness Center a \u201cpill mill\u201d.</p> <p>The doctors were careful to insist their prescriptions were filled only at pharmacies that would take the money and not ask questions. But as word spread and people came from hundreds of miles around, so the drugstores struggled to meet demand.</p> <p>Then, in a town where department stores shut years ago and traditional main street stores gave way to personal injury lawyers, a new drugstore popped up.</p> <p>\u201cSuddenly Tug Valley opens, out of the blue, in 2006. And there are big lines from the first day,\u201d said Smith.</p> <p>Before long, it was outselling its rivals in town. </p> <p>In the six years after Tug Valley opened, pharmaceutical distributors delivered nearly 11m of the most common type of opioid pill, hydrocodone. Month by month, the orders escalated. In 2009 alone, Ballengee ordered 3m hydrocodone pills.<em> </em>Hurley Drug was dispensing nearly as fast.</p> <p>Across the river, Family Pharmacy was so busy that the owner, Larry Ray Barnett, had hundreds of bottles of pills lined up ready for assistants to grab as customers cycled through.</p> <p>The Wellness Center was churning out so many opioid prescriptions that the fax machine couldn\u2019t keep up with transmitting them individually to the pharmacies. So the clinic didn\u2019t bother to send prescriptions at all and took to the illegal practice of writing lists of names and dosages on sheets of paper and faxing them to the pharmacies.</p> <p>Investigators discovered the pharmacies lined up bottles pre-filled with set amounts of pills.</p> <p>\u201cThe list comes in, you print out the name, slap a tag on the bottle. There you go,\u201d said Smith.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018Greed took over\u2019</strong></h2> <p>In the north of Mingo county, another pharmacist looked on enviously. James Wooley got so little business at his drugstore in the village of Kermit in the early 2000s that he also ran a used car business next door.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a fine fella,\u201d said Charles Sparks, Kermit\u2019s mayor then and now. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t beat him as a person. But he just got into that other business, and it starts snowballing and greed took over. You know how it is: if I can make a million, I can make two.\u201d</p> <p>Wooley decided to follow the Williamson model by setting up a doctor to churn out opioid prescriptions for him to fill. The pharmacist persuaded his assistant at the drugstore, Debra Justice, to set up a medical clinic just outside Kermit and they recruited a doctor more than an hour away at Marshall University\u2019s medical school, Dr John Tiano. All he had to do was lend his name to the prescriptions and one of the nurses at the clinic would fill it out.</p> <p>The Justice Medical Complex opened in the spring of 2005, a 10-minute drive from Kermit. Prescriptions were sent directly to Wooley\u2019s pharmacy, the Sav-Rite. The circle was complete. </p> <p>Within a few months, Wooley was filling an opioid prescription a minute in a town of fewer than 400 people. The pharmacy bought more of the opioid than any drugstore in West Virginia or neighbouring states that year and ranked 22nd in the nation among retail pharmacies for hydrocodone purchases. Gross sales surged above $6.5m.</p> <p>Sparks, the mayor, watched the influx.</p> <p>\u201cOh, we were aware. We knew what was going on. The citizens would come and say, \u2018Why don\u2019t you do something about that up there?\u2019 The average person doesn\u2019t know or doesn\u2019t stop and think that you can\u2019t just go in. You have to do an investigation before you can stop something like that. People said nothing\u2019s being done.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Missed opportunities</strong></h2> <p>The two decades of the opioid epidemic is a story of missed opportunities, large and small.</p> <p>If the warnings sounded by pain specialists and doctors in the first few years had been heeded, the crisis might have been averted or at least greatly diminished. If federal regulators had intervened to limit prescribing of high-strength opioids to those who really needed them, there would have been far fewer pills on the streets.</p> <p>West Virginia\u2019s medical regulators missed opportunities too. In 2007, someone anonymously tipped off the West Virginia medical board that Tiano was prescribing illegally. The board\u2019s punishment was to require him to write a \u201cbook report\u201d on a medical textbook called Responsible Opioid Prescribing: A Physician\u2019s Guide.</p> <p>Marshall University forced Tiano to stop moonlighting at the clinic. On his way out the door, having made more than $250,000 from opioid prescribing in just two years, the doctor recruited his successor, Dr Augusto Abad, who lived 90 minutes away in the state capital, Charleston, and rarely saw patients. But plenty of prescriptions were written in his name.</p> <p>By then, Smith was watching. He worked with an FBI agent, Joe Ciccarelli, with a long history of drug investigations. Ciccarelli had come from pursuing Colombian cartels in Florida, but he already knew West Virginia well from working the drug beat as a police officer in the early 1980s.</p> <p>\u201cThese junkies would forge prescriptions, and back in the pre-computer days I can remember standing in pharmacies going through prescriptions going, \u2018that\u2019s a junkie, that\u2019s a junkie, these are false scripts\u2019,\u201d said Ciccarelli, who has since died, in 2017.</p> <p>An informant tipped them off that Debra Justice and Wooley had hatched a get rich(er) quick scheme to open a pain clinic that would refer all of its prescriptions for controlled substances to Sav-Rite Kermit, and that they were \u201chanding out drugs like candy\u201d.</p> <p>Mary Ann Withrow, a federal agent, said investigators recorded that the Sav-Rite and the clinic were \u201cexcessively busy\u201d for such a small town.</p> <p>One undercover agent noted that the cash drawer at the Sav-Rite was so full the assistant couldn\u2019t close it. Something similar was going on at the Tug Valley Pharmacy and Hurley\u2019s in Williamson.</p> <p>\u201cIt looked like a carnival,\u201d said Smith. \u201cThere\u2019s no way people down there didn\u2019t know what was going on. There was a lot of money being made.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Federal charges</strong></h2> <p>Years later, all of the pharmacists claim to have not seen any of this.</p> <p>Ballengee was arrested in July, days after an Ohio court released Drug Enforcement Administration documents showing that pharmaceutical distributors delivered millions of opioid pills to his tiny pharmacy.</p> <p>Federal prosecutors charged him with making millions of dollars from illegally supplying opioids alongside Anthony Rattini, the former president of Ballengee\u2019s major suppliers, Miami-Luken, and others. Rattini is accused of <a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wvsd.227232/gov.uscourts.wvsd.227232.1.0.pdf\">distributing narcotic painkillers</a> illegally to more than 200 pharmacies across West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana and Tennessee.</p> <p>Ballengee testified in earlier civil depositions that he was filling between 150 and 200 opioid prescriptions a day from the Wellness clinic alone, but claimed to see no reason for suspicion. He denied knowing that the clinic was widely spoken about in town as a \u201cpill mill\u201d. He also said he was unaware that Williamson was nicknamed \u201cPilliamson\u201d, or that a doctor who was one of the main prescribers was known as \u201cPill Billy\u201d.</p> <p>Barnett, who owned Family Pharmacy, also professed not to know the reputation of the Wellness Center or that it had a list of acceptable pharmacies for patients to fill opioid prescriptions and that his was on it. Like Ballengee, he claimed not to know about the reputation of the prescribing doctors, including one who was described in a local newspaper as \u201ca danger to the community because he prescribed thousands of addictive pills without legitimate purpose\u201d. He saw no red flags even as the prescriptions poured in by fax and phone.</p> <p>Under oath, Wooley said he didn\u2019t remember ever seeing articles in trade magazines warning about escalating opioid addiction, or patients going from one doctor to another in search of multiple prescriptions. </p> <p>Smith went to federal prosecutors with the evidence about the illegal lists of prescriptions and pressed them to file charges. The policeman said it fell under the definition of wire fraud.</p> <p>\u201cI tried to use the wire fraud to get everybody, the pharmacies and the doctors. They didn\u2019t go for that,\u201d he said.</p> <p>So he went to the West Virginia board of pharmacy.</p> <p>\u201cThey said I was right in what I was alleging. However, what they did is they talked to the pharmacists and told them they couldn\u2019t do that any more,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole thing was a game, a scam. Everyone was going along with it.\u201d</p> <p>Eventually, the FBI and state police moved in on the Sav-Rite in Kermit in 2009, arresting Wooley.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re standing out there with a couple of uniformed troopers and cars just keep going up,\u201d said Ciccarelli. \u201cWhere are you from? I came from Point Pleasant. OK, let\u2019s see. You passed about three hospitals, probably 50 pharmacies, and you\u2019re driving 100 miles from Point Pleasant to Kermit to pick up a prescription? It\u2019s things like that you can put in front of a jury and they\u2019re going to go, that ain\u2019t right. You stack those things up and a jury\u2019s finally going to say, I don\u2019t believe this.\u201d</p> <p>Wooley pleaded guilty to illegally selling prescription medication and conspiracy, and went to prison for six months in 2012. The doctors at the clinic he set up were each jailed for a year. Tiano lost his medical licence. On his release, Abad was deported to his home country, the Philippines, where he continues to practise.</p> <p>\u201cIt boggles my mind,\u201d said Sparks, the mayor. \u201cI was blown away. I thought, \u2018My God, almost 9m pills in two years went out of here, and Wooley said that he made $500,000 a month in a little town of 400 people.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The following year, the FBI and state police raided the Williamson clinic, arrested doctors and cut off the opioid pipeline. The numbers of prescriptions fell sharply.</p> <p>In 2016, a major drug distributor, McKesson abruptly ended its contract with Tug Valley Pharmacy when West Virginia\u2019s attorney general, Patrick Morrisey, filed a lawsuit against the company accusing it of recklessly distribution millions of pills across the state. Earlier this year, McKesson <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-usa-opioids-litigation/mckesson-to-pay-37-million-to-resolve-west-virginia-opioid-lawsuit-idUKKCN1S81HO\">paid the state</a> $37m to settle the suit. In 2017, the West Virginia board of pharmacy dismissed its director for failing to properly regulate the flood of opioids to the state\u2019s pharmacies and investigate suspicious deliveries.</p> <p>Prosecutors prepared charges against Barnett, but he died before he could be brought to trial.</p> <p>Up until his arrest, Ballengee continued to insist that he was doing no more than filling prescriptions written by doctors. He is now awaiting trial.</p> <p><em>Chris McGreal is the author of American Overdose, The Opioid Tragedy in Three Acts</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Tug Valley Pharmacy was late to the gold rush, but swiftly made up for lost time. To the watching investigators, the stone building with a peaked red roof looked more like a rural cabin than a fount for the millions of opioid pills spilling across Appalachia. The giveaway was the drive-thru window, and the cars lined up past the abandoned ghost shops in downtown Williamson, West Virginia. The name of the pharmacy\u2019s owner, Samuel R Ballengee PharmD, was displayed on the window under a sales pitch: \u201cIt\u2019s all in the bag.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s call this whole thing what it is. It\u2019s pretty much a cartel. A drug trafficking organisation,\u201d said Sgt Mike Smith of West Virginia state police, who spent years unravelling the web of doctors, pharmacists and drug companies that made rural Mingo county the opioid capital of America. \u201cThen right in the middle of this drug trafficking organisation, you have a little pharmacy that pops up and everybody\u2019s OK with it. I\u2019m sitting here looking at this. It\u2019s hard to believe that was allowed.\u201d It wasn\u2019t long before drug distribution companies, some of the largest firms in America among them, were delivering millions of opioid pills a year to Tug Valley. Millions more were shipped to another pharmacy, Hurley\u2019s Drug Store, four blocks away. All in a town of fewer than 3,000 people. Twenty minutes\u2019 drive to the north, the Sav-Rite Pharmacy in the village of Kermit, population 280 and falling, was outstripping them both. Drug distributors delivered more than 30m opioid pills just to those three pharmacies, in one of the poorest counties in America. Ballengee and the other drug store owners kept escalating the orders, and the distributors filled them without flinching. They shipped more narcotic painkillers to Mingo county per head of population than to any other place in the US. Opioid makers such as Purdue Pharma and Johnson &amp; Johnson shaped the medical culture that drove the surge in prescribing of narcotic painkillers that caused today\u2019s drug epidemic. Doctors wrote the prescriptions. But at the front end were thousands of pharmacies dispensing the pills, and among the pharmacists were profiteers. No questions asked In 2001, the West Virginia bureau of criminal investigation sent Smith to investigate a surge of opioids pills on the streets. At first he planned to approach it the way he investigated marijuana: by working along the chain from the user to the dealer to the producer with the threat of jail to prise information from suspects. But Smith quickly discovered that users were happy to tell him where he could find doctors to write prescriptions and drug stores to fill them \u2013 no questions asked. They pointed him to Mingo county. Smith went and watched. Each day, hundreds of people lined up outside an old animal feed store where a group of doctors were set up by a former pimp, just out of federal prison for running a gay prostitution ring in Washington DC, to churn out opioid prescriptions faster than West Virginia\u2019s major hospitals. Before long, people in town were calling the Williamson Wellness Center a \u201cpill mill\u201d. The doctors were careful to insist their prescriptions were filled only at pharmacies that would take the money and not ask questions. But as word spread and people came from hundreds of miles around, so the drugstores struggled to meet demand.

      "bodyText": "Supermarkets close to Carlisle and Berwick reported a surge in alcohol sales after minimum unit pricing was introduced in Scotland. A study for NHS Scotland found that alcohol sales jumped by 40% in one English supermarket close to the border and 25% in another, in the three months after cheap alcohol sales were banned in Scotland. Minimum unit pricing (MUP) came into force in Scotland on 1 May 2018, in an attempt to cut Scotland\u2019s higher-than average alcohol consumption and high death rates from alcohol-related diseases. It bars retailers from selling alcoholic drinks, including beers, wines, spirits and ciders, at less than 50p per unit of alcohol. The Welsh government is also introducing minimum pricing and its cross-border effects will be closely studied by ministers in Cardiff. The NHS analysis of the impact of MUP on retailers found this meant sales of cut-price drinks such as ciders or own brand vodka fell in Scotland, while overall consumption of alcohol fell slightly. A study in the British Medical Journal last week found that MUP led to alcohol consumption falling by 1.2 units per person per week, equivalent to a measure of spirits or half a pint of beer. The impacts were greatest on the heaviest drinkers, whose consumption fell by 2 units. The study, carried out for NHS Scotland by Frontier Economics over the first eight months of minimum pricing, found MUP had some impact on sales and profits, but that was cushioned heavily by a growth in sales of premium drinks with higher margins. Some shops saw their profits go up, but none cut prices of other products to compensate customers. The study found there was no evidence of so-called \u201cwhite van runs\u201d where vans were stocked up in English supermarkets with cheaper drinks for sale in Scotland, despite the fears of some retailers\u2019 bodies before MUP came into force. However, there was evidence that Scottish residents who work in or visited English towns close to the border appeared to buy far more alcohol in some stores than before. That was not uniform: three of the five unnamed supermarkets near the border who were interviewed reported no change in their sales, and there was no evidence of a substantial fall in sales for Scottish shops near the border. Two reported a \u201csubstantial increase\u201d in sales, which tailed off slightly later last year but were \u201cstill well above normal\u201d. Morrisons owns the supermarket closest to the border north of Berwick and Asda the supermarket nearest Scotland north of Carlisle. The study said that could have been due to the hot weather last summer and the football World Cup in Russia, but it found comparable stores in other parts of England did not see such rises. Andrew Leicester, from Frontier Economics, said a far more robust picture about the effects of MUP on businesses would take some time. \u201cThe short-term impacts of MUP on the Scottish alcoholic drinks industry seen in this study are difficult to differentiate from other factors affecting the market \u2013 such as one-off events like the World Cup and periods of good weather,\u201d he said. \u2022 This article was amended on 2 October 2019. An earlier version incorrectly named the consultants Frontier Economics as \u201cForesight Economics\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Migrant labourers are being worked to death in searing temperatures in Qatar, with hundreds estimated to be dying from heat stress every year, a Guardian investigation can reveal. This summer, hundreds of thousands of migrant workers toiled in temperatures of up to 45C for up to 10 hours a day as Qatar\u2019s construction boom hit its peak ahead of the Fifa World Cup 2022. The Qatari authorities, in line with other countries across the Gulf, have said they are protecting workers from heat-related injuries through a work ban that prohibits manual labour in unshaded outdoor areas between 11.30 and 3pm from mid-June to August. Yet a Guardian analysis of official weather data over a nine-year period showed that the working ban does not keep workers safe. In the hours outside the ban, anyone working outdoors is still being exposed to potentially fatal levels of heat stress between June and September, which cardiologists say is leading to high numbers of fatalities every year. Our analysis also found dangerous levels of heat exposure continues into the cooler months. Doha is currently hosting the World Athletics Championships, with athletes and sports professionals describing extreme heat conditions over the weekend. Yet outside of the air-conditioned stadiums, workers remain at risk of serious harm from heat stress between 9am and 12 noon throughout October. Working in high temperatures puts a huge strain on the human cardiovascular system, with extreme heat stress leading to fatal heart attacks and other cardiovascular fatalities, recent research has shown. Every year hundreds of workers \u2013 many young men between 25 and 35 years old \u2013 die while working in Qatar. The majority of these deaths are attributed to cardiovascular causes or \u201cnatural death\u201d by the Qatari authorities. Yet recent research published in the Cardiology Journal by a group of leading climatologists and cardiologists concluded that the deaths were likely to be caused by heatstroke, exploring the correlation between the deaths of 1,300 Nepali workers between 2009 and 2017, and rising temperatures. The research found that in the cooler months about 22% of deaths year-on-year were attributed to heart attacks, cardiac arrest or other cardio-related causes by the Qatari authorities. In the summer months this spiked to 58%. \u201cFrom our research it was clear that workers are being recruited in their home countries partly on the basis of their health and are arriving in the Gulf fit for work,\u201d said Dr Dan Atar, professor of cardiology and head of research at Oslo University Hospital, who co-authored the research into cardiovascular deaths and heat stress. \u201cYoung men have a very low incidence of heart attacks yet hundreds of them are dying every year in Qatar attributed to cardiovascular causes. The clear conclusion that I draw from this as a cardiologist is that these deaths are caused by deadly heatstroke. Their bodies cannot take the heat stress they are being exposed to.\u201d Atar said that according to the research, as many as 200 of the 571 young men who died of cardiovascular causes between 2009 and 2017 could have been saved if effective heat protection measures had been implemented as part of occupational health and safety programmes. Qatar\u2019s construction boom ahead of the 2022 Fifa World Cup has seen the country\u2019s migrant worker population rise to 1.9m, many of these young men from Nepal, India, Bangladesh and Pakistan who travel to the country to build the stadiums, roads and hotels that will service the tournament. Of the 11 worker fatalities of workers linked to Fifa World Cup stadiums recorded by Qatar\u2019s Supreme Committee, the body responsible for workers\u2019 health and safety last year, nine were attributed to sudden heart attacks or respiratory failure. \u201cWith the World Cup only two years away, the high number of deaths of young men from cardiac arrest in Qatar must be investigated urgently,\u201d said Nick McGeehan, director of Fair/Square Projects, which has conducted research on heat stress and migrant worker rights. \u201cFor years human rights campaigners have been raising the impact of heat stress on worker fatalities and yet the deaths continue.\u201d In Doha, a sign outside one construction site warned workers to \u201cBeat the heat\u201d and \u201cQuench your thirst \u2013 safety first\u201d, but a Kenyan labourer dressed in sweat-stained pale blue overalls said there was no clean drinking water on the site. \u201cWhen it\u2019s hot it\u2019s too tough.

Speaking to the Guardian this August, migrant workers said they suffered from a range of heat-related conditions, including skin allergies, headaches, altered vision, light-headedness and difficulty breathing. \u201cIn one minute I\u2019m soaked in sweat,\u201d said one Nepali construction worker. The Guardian used weather data from 2008-2017 to calculate the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) for Qatar, an internationally used metric that uses wind speed, solar radiation, humidity and air temperature to assess the impact of heat stress on the human body. A WGBT reading of 28C and above is internationally accepted as the point at which the human body is dangerously affected by heat stress. Our analysis found that: In June, before the summer work ban comes into effect on the 15th of the month, it is only safe to work for a maximum of 15 minutes an hour between 9am and 3pm. Some days no work at all can be done without serious risk to workers\u2019 health. In July, despite the summer work ban, workers are still exposed to high levels of heat stress between 6am and 3pm, and some days well into the evening. Anyone working outside should have worked a maximum of 15 minutes an hour between 9 and 12. In August it is unsafe to work outside in Qatar between 6am and 9pm. According to the WBGT analysis, between 9am and 12 noon outdoor work should be stopped entirely. From 3-6pm, work should only be resumed for 15 minutes an hour to avoid physical harm from the heat. After the outdoor working ban ends on 31 August, it continues to be very dangerous to work outdoors throughout September. Heat stress is a serious risk between 6am and 3pm. Until 19 September, work should be stopped entirely between 9am and 3pm.

      "bodyText": "There are many who believe Richard III has an undeservedly malignant reputation. For the historian David Starkey it is not malignant enough. He was a \u201cmurderous thug\u201d, Starkey said on Tuesday as he unveiled a late 16th-century portrait of the king, which goes on public display from Wednesday for the first time. The portrait has been purchased from a private collection by Hever Castle in Kent to hang in its Long Gallery, filling a gap in its remarkable collection of royal historic portraits. Starkey is delighted by the purchase, less so by the man, calling attempts to improve Richard III\u2019s reputation \u201ca fascinating example of the English fascination with a loser\u201d. One of the \u201cfunniest events in recent history\u201d, Starkey said, was the reburial ceremony after the discovery of Richard\u2019s body in a car park. \u201cA ludicrous performance complete with Diana-esque scenes of public sobbing and mourning.\u201d The newly displayed portrait is an example of the only painted portrait of Richard, best known from a 16th-century panel in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery. It shows the king placing a ring on his extraordinarily long little finger, seen by some as evidence of his despicably cruel nature. Starkey said it was important to put Richard III, who reigned for two years before defeat at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, in a house devoted to the Tudors and in a gallery \u2013 which he has curated \u2013 which tells their story. \u201cRichard III is the real founder of the House of Tudor. If he hadn\u2019t split the House of York we would have never heard of Henry VII. Henry, Earl of Richmond would have been some forgotten exile.\u201d The newly purchased painting has been in private collections for many years. Duncan Leslie, Hever Castle\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cI am delighted that we have been able to purchase this painting and further enhance the historical experience we offer. It is an important addition to better tell the story of the Tudors, or rather how they came about.\u201d Different people will look at the portrait and see different things. Starkey says he looks at it and sees the former prime minister Gordon Brown. \u201cThat twitch, that nervous intensity, the fiddling with the hands, the frown.\u201d The painting goes on display from 2 October, 567 years to the day since Richard III was born.",

      "bodyText": "The strength of Fox News, and much of its appeal to its viewers, is in its monolithic presentation of the news, particularly when it is favorable to Donald Trump. But as the president faces the looming shadow of an impeachment inquiry, the channel\u2019s unified front appears to be crumbling. Some of the news anchors are reporting that there does appear to be something to the Ukraine scandal, while Fox News\u2019 more colorful personalities have been squabbling back and forth on air. Meanwhile, reports have emerged that management may be considering the possibilities of a post-Trump future. Here\u2019s a look at how things have progressed over the last week. Tuesday: impeachment inquiry splits Fox News Almost immediately upon news of the impeachment inquiry, tension among the ranks at Fox News began to emerge, pitting Shepard Smith, one of the more reliable journalists at the station \u2013 relatively speaking \u2013 against conspiracy-theory-loving Tucker Carlson. Tuesday afternoon, Smith invited the contributor and Trump critic Judge Andrew Napolitano on to his program. Napolitano called the president\u2019s actions a clear crime, likening it to the same behavior he had been under investigation for in the Mueller investigation. Later that night Carlson, being a reliable Trump attack dog, had his own judicial analyst Joseph diGenova on, who called Napolitano a \u201cfool\u201d and denied any of it was a crime whatsoever. Wednesday: Tucker Carlson\u2019s colleague calls him \u2018repugnant\u2019 The next day Smith denounced diGenova, and Carlson by extension, calling him a \u201cpartisan\u201d. \u201cAttacking our colleague, who is here to offer legal assessments, on our air in our work home is repugnant,\u201d he said. Carlson fired back on his program, mocking Smith\u2019s use of the word \u201crepugnant\u201d and saying \u201cunlike maybe some dayside hosts, I\u2019m not very partisan\u201d. Meanwhile, another round of friendly fire was being exchanged on The Five when the co-host Juan Williams accused his counterparts of reading directly from talking points released by the White House. Greg Gutfeld was among his co-hosts to take particular umbrage, accusing Williams in turn of getting his own ideas from Media Matters, a leftwing group that monitors conservative media. They had just laid out a point-by-point case highlighting the similarities between the messaging of the Trump administration and pundits on the network. Later that night Sean Hannity called the whistleblower a \u201ca partisan hack whose claims are politically motivated\u201d, despite the identity of the whistleblower still being unknown. Thursday: threatening to take people off the air After two days of internecine conflict, the Fox News CEO, Suzanne Scott, and the president, Jay Wallace reportedly stepped in, appearing to favor Carlson, and saying that if Smith went after him again he would be taken off the air. When the whistleblower complaint was released, the hosts of Fox &amp; Friends had to be corrected by their own correspondent over whether the whistleblower was biased or politically motivated. \u201cWhat is the bias there?\u201d Ainsley Earhardt asked Catherine Herridge, who had read the complaint. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard the attorneys he hired were possibly interns for Schumer and Hillary Clinton. Is there more political bias?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m just not seeing that in this document,\u201d replied Herridge. Appearing on Hannity\u2019s program that night, diGenova re-emerged to accuse the whistleblower of being connected to George Soros. Not only is there is no evidence for this, but it also echoes many antisemitic conspiracy theories from the far right that center on Soros, painting him a leftwing puppetmaster. Friday: Chris Wallace calls his colleagues \u2018deeply misleading\u2019 As Trump continued his tweet storm proclaiming his innocence and calling this another witch-hunt by the crooked media, Fox News commentators rejoined the effort to assign a political bias to the whistleblower. On The Five, Geraldo Rivera echoed Gutfeld in accusing (while also \u201cnot accusing\u201d) Media Matters of complicity. \u201cI bet it can be traced ultimately, and I\u2019m not accusing them, but a group like Media Matters is in here, with their dirty hands,\u201d he said. But on the afternoon side of the programming, doubts about Trump\u2019s innocence remained. Chris Wallace, another of the relatively neutral on-air personalities who also broke the rare bit of original reporting on Trump from the network, called the spinning from the president\u2019s defenders \u201cnot surprising, but it is astonishing and deeply misleading\u201d. But by Friday evening, Giuliani was on Hannity roping Hillary Clinton into a conspiracy theory, saying she colluded with Ukraine to dig up dirt on Trump. Saturday: \u2018What\u2019s the crime?\u2019 To kick off the weekend Jesse Watters took a taunting tone towards Democrats. \u201cImpeachment? Go for it, libs,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to die in the Senate. Trump\u2019s still gonna get re-elected. Then what are you going to do?\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s the crime? Democrats can\u2019t explain it,\u201d he asked, before scoffing at the idea that the president shouldn\u2019t be able to ask other countries to investigate his political rivals. Jeanine Pirro said the presidency has been under siege, saying Trump has been subjected to \u201cunprecedented maligning\u201d by \u201cthe mainstream media, high level Obama administration officials, and disappointed, disgruntled and deranged Democrats\u201d. Meanwhile, Greg Gutfeld aired a piece on a sexy Mr Rogers costume. Sunday: and now we\u2019re talking about civil war During Fox &amp; Friends on Sunday morning, the host Ed Henry asked the conservative radio host Mark Levin if he was OK with the president asking Ukraine for dirt on Biden. The mere question sent the president, likely watching at home, spiraling into a raging tweet storm, including retweeting a parody account that automatically inserts the word \u201cshark\u201d into Trump tweets. For his part, Henry, a reliable Trump supporter, seemed to be confused by the sudden attack from the president. On Fox &amp; Friends weekend, the contributor Robert Jeffress suggested if Trump were to be removed from office it would lead to a \u201cCivil war-like fracture in this nation from which this country will never heal\u201d. The president himself promptly shared that sentiment on Twitter. Monday: this is a coup By Monday the civil war theme had spread far and wide among the Fox universe. Newt Gingrich said on Hannity\u2019s radio program that this was not an impeachment attempt, it was a coup d\u2019etat. The former New York City police commissioner Bernie Kerik went on Fox &amp; Friends echoing that idea.

      "body": "<p>The Los Angeles district attorney is prosecuting the rapper Drakeo the Ruler for a murder he didn\u2019t commit, arguing in court that his rap lyrics, videos and collaborations are evidence of a \u201cconspiracy\u201d.</p> <p>The case moving forward this week marks the third time Drakeo, whose legal name is Darrell Caldwell, is facing charges stemming from the 2016 murder of 24-year-old Davion Gregory. After Drakeo <a href=\"https://www.thefader.com/2019/07/25/drakeo-the-ruler-murder-verdict-news-july-2019\">beat</a> a murder charge this summer, prosecutors are launching a new trial against the 25-year-old rapper, arguing he is the leader of a \u201cgang\u201d responsible for the homicide. The alleged gang is his rap crew, the Stinc Team.</p> <p>Drakeo is, once again, facing life in prison.</p> <p>\u201cWhen is this going to be over? When is it going to stop? When are they going to leave me alone?\u201d Drakeo said in a recent phone call from the Men\u2019s Central Jail in downtown LA, where he has been incarcerated for 18 months. \u201cIt feels like some kind of vendetta. It\u2019s not about finding justice. It\u2019s about taking my career from me.\u201d</p> <p>Civil rights activists across the US are closely watching <a href=\"https://www.thefader.com/2019/07/11/drakeo-the-ruler-murder-trial-los-angeles-report\">Drakeo\u2019s case</a>, saying it\u2019s a critical free speech test and an egregious example of racist and aggressive policing of black men and their creative expression. Experts estimate there have been hundreds, if not thousands, of similar cases of law enforcement severely punishing rappers for their songs.</p> <p>\u201cThey don\u2019t understand us. They don\u2019t understand our culture. So they demonize us,\u201d said Brandon Duncan, a San Diego rapper known as Tiny Doo, whose rap album was also used as a key piece of evidence in gang-related charges<em>. </em>\u201cThey are telling us we can\u2019t speak, that you can go to jail for your music.\u201d</p> <h2>A rising career, stalled by police</h2> <p>Drakeo was born in 1993 in South-Central LA and started a dance crew with his brother when he was a teenager. He got into rapping early and formed a group with friends called Too Greedy, a name they adopted in middle school. They later called themselves the Stinc Team.</p> <p>Rapping was a way to make money, and stay out of the streets, he said.</p> <p>On the night of 10 December 2016, Drakeo, then 23, drove with a dozen friends to a South LA party.

It makes it very easy to pin crimes on people who were not involved.\u201d</p> <p>The broader problem is the law gives police wide discretion to brand anyone a gang member simply based on where they live, added Jess Jollett, an activist who worked with Tiny Doo. If the DA convicts Drakeo, it would set a terrible precedent, she said: \u201cThat means prosecutors no longer have to gather evidence. They don\u2019t have to build cases.

      "bodyText": "The Los Angeles district attorney is prosecuting the rapper Drakeo the Ruler for a murder he didn\u2019t commit, arguing in court that his rap lyrics, videos and collaborations are evidence of a \u201cconspiracy\u201d. The case moving forward this week marks the third time Drakeo, whose legal name is Darrell Caldwell, is facing charges stemming from the 2016 murder of 24-year-old Davion Gregory. After Drakeo beat a murder charge this summer, prosecutors are launching a new trial against the 25-year-old rapper, arguing he is the leader of a \u201cgang\u201d responsible for the homicide. The alleged gang is his rap crew, the Stinc Team. Drakeo is, once again, facing life in prison. \u201cWhen is this going to be over? When is it going to stop? When are they going to leave me alone?\u201d Drakeo said in a recent phone call from the Men\u2019s Central Jail in downtown LA, where he has been incarcerated for 18 months. \u201cIt feels like some kind of vendetta. It\u2019s not about finding justice. It\u2019s about taking my career from me.\u201d Civil rights activists across the US are closely watching Drakeo\u2019s case, saying it\u2019s a critical free speech test and an egregious example of racist and aggressive policing of black men and their creative expression. Experts estimate there have been hundreds, if not thousands, of similar cases of law enforcement severely punishing rappers for their songs. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand us. They don\u2019t understand our culture. So they demonize us,\u201d said Brandon Duncan, a San Diego rapper known as Tiny Doo, whose rap album was also used as a key piece of evidence in gang-related charges. \u201cThey are telling us we can\u2019t speak, that you can go to jail for your music.\u201d A rising career, stalled by police Drakeo was born in 1993 in South-Central LA and started a dance crew with his brother when he was a teenager. He got into rapping early and formed a group with friends called Too Greedy, a name they adopted in middle school. They later called themselves the Stinc Team. Rapping was a way to make money, and stay out of the streets, he said. On the night of 10 December 2016, Drakeo, then 23, drove with a dozen friends to a South LA party. A shooting broke out among the guests, and Davion Gregory was killed. Rumors spread online that Drakeo was involved, since his Mercedes was seen leaving the scene. Records suggest law enforcement nearly immediately began investigating him as a suspect, watching hours of his rap videos. A month later, police raided Drakeo\u2019s apartment, found guns and arrested him. During questioning, a Los Angeles sheriff\u2019s department (LASD) detective, Francis Hardiman, told the rapper his music would be the \u201csoundtrack\u201d in a trial. \u201cJurors don\u2019t like to see that stuff \u2026 your rap videos of you talking about shooting,\u201d Hardiman said. The detective cited one lyric, \u201cchopper makes you go ugh\u201d (chopper is slang for rifle), and added that a district attorney could prosecute the rapper by playing that line \u201cover and over again\u201d: \u201cI\u2019m not a giant rap fan, just so you know,\u201d Hardiman added. Drakeo signed a plea deal and went to prison on a weapons possession charge. He was released in November 2017 and returned to music, earning national acclaim as a standout in a new generation of LA rap. The Washington Post called his December 2017 album Cold Devil \u201cone of the most mesmerizing and intimate rap albums to ever float out of LA\u201d, with a delivery that \u201cmight be the most intoxicating sound to waft across California since the arrival of Snoop Dogg\u201d. But LASD wasn\u2019t done yet. Lyrics and music videos on trial In September 2018, Drakeo was indicted on a wide range of felonies related to the December 2016 incident, including murder, conspiracy murder, criminal gang conspiracy, shooting from a vehicle, illegal possession of a firearm and a number of attempted murder charges for other victims. Prosecutors knew that Drakeo hadn\u2019t killed Gregory \u2013 detectives had obtained audio recordings documenting a 17-year-old alleged gang member confessing to the killing and a man linked to Drakeo\u2019s rap crew confessing to firing additional shots. But they argued during the trial in May 2019 that the rap crew was a criminal \u201cgang\u201d that planned the killing. \u201cAs his moniker suggests, he is the leader \u2026 They rap about their crimes,\u201d the prosecutor Shannon Cooley said. Detective Hardiman told the court he used \u201cthe greatest crime-fighting tools on earth \u2013 Google and social media\u201d and found a music video featuring Drakeo and one of the men involved in the shooting, holding a gun that he said matched the ballistics at the crime scene. Hardiman also cited a Drakeo lyric from a diss track in which Drakeo spoke about driving around with a rival rapper \u201ctied up in the back\u201d. Prosecutors said Drakeo was plotting to kill the rapper, and that his crew ended up killing Gregory instead. \u2018There is no gang, it\u2019s a rap group\u2019 Drakeo and his lawyers have argued that the prosecutor\u2019s narrative was manufactured and that the analysis of his music was laughable. \u201cThe whole point of me starting to rap is I get to rap and talk about these things and not do these things,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cAnd what would you rather, me rapping about stuff that I\u2019m not actually doing, or out there doing it? It\u2019s not real. Rapping is rhyming and pretending. It\u2019s a persona.\u201d \u201cHow are you gonna tell me what I mean?\u201d he added. Drakeo\u2019s lawyers said the rapper had had a previous run-in with the law (attempting to steal from a liquor store at age 16) and that some in his rap crew had been involved in petty crime, but that Stinc Team was fundamentally not a gang. The lyric about the rival rapper stemmed from standard, harmless rap beef, his lawyers said. The rapper himself later said on social media that Drakeo wasn\u2019t seriously trying to kill him. The DA\u2019s own witness also said Drakeo didn\u2019t know the shooting was going to happen. \u201cThere is no gang. It\u2019s a rap group. What the fuck? \u2026 I\u2019m not a gang member and my friends are not gang members,\u201d Drakeo said, arguing he was \u201cat the wrong place at the wrong time\u201d. In July, a jury acquitted Drakeo of all murder and attempted murder offenses. The jury convicted the rapper of a single firearms possession charge and was deadlocked on two counts \u2013 criminal gang conspiracy and shooting from a vehicle. The DA announced last month that it planned to retry the case and bring him to trial again for the two hung counts. Hundreds prosecuted for rap: \u2018Tip of the iceberg\u2019 For the gang conspiracy charge Drakeo is still facing, LA prosecutors are relying on an opaque California penal code called 182.5, a number that now sparks fear in some rap communities. It allows DAs to prosecute people who allegedly \u201cbenefit\u201d from criminal gang activity. As Cooley, the DA, recently explained in court, this law is so broad, she doesn\u2019t even have to prove Drakeo had intent or an agreement to kill anyone: \u201cAll this is saying [is] if you are an active participant in your gang, and someone from your gang commits murder, and you benefit from that murder, that you get convicted.\u201d The law received national scrutiny in 2014 when San Diego prosecutors accused the rapper Tiny Doo of gang conspiracy, alleging that his album that referenced gun violence provided evidence that he benefited from local gang-related shootings. He was not accused of participating in any of the crimes, and a judge dismissed the case \u2013 after he spent eight months in jail. Like Drakeo, Tiny Doo said his life unraveled as a result. \u201cI live in fear every day, because they can charge me for a crime someone else committed,\u201d the 37-year-old said, noting that the jail time badly damaged his children, whom he was raising by himself, and forced him to miss the funeral of his grandfather.

      "body": "<p>TripAdvisor has announced it will not sell tickets to attractions that breed or import captive whales and dolphins used for public display. The travel site has confirmed the move will affect major attractions that include SeaWorld\u2019s theme parks.</p> <p>TripAdvisor and its subsidiary, Viator, will end commercial relationships with facilities that do not have, or are not in the process of developing, alternative environments for captive cetaceans, which includes whales, dolphins and porpoises.</p> <p>\u201cThey would have to have made a public commitment either to cease all breeding and importation of cetaceans for display with immediate effect or to develop alternative models, such as seaside-sanctuary environments, for the population of captive cetaceans already in their care,\u201d said James Kay, director of corporate communications for TripAdvisor.</p> <p>The travel site defines seaside sanctuaries as a body of coastal water, such as a bay or a cove, that houses cetaceans in as close to a natural environment as possible while providing protection and oversight from qualified husbandry and veterinary staff. It adds that these environments must adhere to a strict no-breeding policy, must not train their animals to perform in any shows or performances for public display, and must prohibit all forms of physical interaction between guests and the animals.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe the current generation of whales and dolphins in captivity should be the last,\u201d said Dermot Halpin, president of experiences and rentals for TripAdvisor. \u201cSeaside sanctuaries have enormous potential but they need more backing from the tourism industry. As long as facilities with captive whales and dolphins continue to profit from keeping these animals in smaller, cheaper and less-natural living environments, then they don\u2019t have enough incentive to adopt serious change.\u201d</p> <p>The new approach applies to commercial and non-profit attractions who must have \u201cmade a public commitment to rehouse all captive cetaceans in its care to these environments in an expedient manner\u201d. TripAdvisor says those it views as in breach will be removed from sale over the next few months, with the policy in full force by the end of 2019.</p> <p>Kay confirmed that major attractions, including SeaWorld and Loro Parque would be affected by the change.</p> <p>\u201cIn the case of SeaWorld, it has committed to not breeding orcas, but has not made the same commitment for other cetaceans in its care, and therefore wouldn\u2019t be eligible for sale under the new policy. In contrast, the National Aquarium in Baltimore is creating a sanctuary for its dolphins, so that is one example of an attraction that will still be eligible for sale,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Kay confirmed the new policy only affects tickets sales through the site and does not mean attractions will be delisted. TripAdvisor still wants travellers to be able to share their feedback about the attractions, good or bad.</p> <p>Although TripAdvisor is aiming to put pressure on the industry to end the captivity of future generations of cetaceans, the new policy does not include a ban on ticket sales to attractions with animals already in captivity. After a consultation process with experts, including marine biologists, zoologists and conservationists, TripAdvisor says that for the current population of cetaceans in captivity, \u201crelease into the wild is not a realistic option\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cScience has revealed the immense suffering and early mortality imposed upon cetaceans exploited for captive public display. These facilities can also threaten real conservation efforts to save these animals in the wild,\u201d said Toni Frohoff, a cetacean behavioural biologist from Terramar Research. \u201cNow that we know better, we should do better, and not support these facilities by visiting them.\u201d</p> <p>Conservation groups, some of whom were consulted on the policy, have largely welcomed the move as an important step forward in tourism and animal welfare.</p> <p>\u201cThis sends a clear message to other travel companies that we must end this cruel industry once and for all,\u201d said Nick Stewart, World Animal Protection\u2019s global head of campaign. \u201cTogether we can ensure this is the last generation of dolphins held captive for entertainment.\u201d</p> <p>Other organisations called on TripAdivsor to ensure strict criteria to only allow the promotion of true sanctuaries, and strengthen its animal welfare further still.</p> <p>\u201cWith its global influence on holidaymakers and the tourism industry, this action will no doubt have a significant impact on the captive-cetacean industry,\u201d said Nicola O\u2019Brien, campaigns director for Freedom for Animals. \u201cWe would now urge TripAdvisor to take this action further, and extend this commitment to facilities that exploit many different species for entertainment.\u201d</p> <p>The announcement is the next step in <a href=\"https://tripadvisor.mediaroom.com/press-releases?item=125823\">TripAdvisor\u2019s animal welfare policy</a>, which first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/oct/12/tripadvisor-no-touch-policy-wild-animals-holiday-attractions\">launched in 2016</a>. This already includes a ban on tickets sales to any experiences where travellers come into physical contact with captive wild animals. In 2018, it also banned ticket sales to attractions that included \u201cdemeaning animal shows and performances\u201d.</p>",

It adds that these environments must adhere to a strict no-breeding policy, must not train their animals to perform in any shows or performances for public display, and must prohibit all forms of physical interaction between guests and the animals. \u201cWe believe the current generation of whales and dolphins in captivity should be the last,\u201d said Dermot Halpin, president of experiences and rentals for TripAdvisor. \u201cSeaside sanctuaries have enormous potential but they need more backing from the tourism industry. As long as facilities with captive whales and dolphins continue to profit from keeping these animals in smaller, cheaper and less-natural living environments, then they don\u2019t have enough incentive to adopt serious change.\u201d The new approach applies to commercial and non-profit attractions who must have \u201cmade a public commitment to rehouse all captive cetaceans in its care to these environments in an expedient manner\u201d. TripAdvisor says those it views as in breach will be removed from sale over the next few months, with the policy in full force by the end of 2019. Kay confirmed that major attractions, including SeaWorld and Loro Parque would be affected by the change. \u201cIn the case of SeaWorld, it has committed to not breeding orcas, but has not made the same commitment for other cetaceans in its care, and therefore wouldn\u2019t be eligible for sale under the new policy. In contrast, the National Aquarium in Baltimore is creating a sanctuary for its dolphins, so that is one example of an attraction that will still be eligible for sale,\u201d he said. Kay confirmed the new policy only affects tickets sales through the site and does not mean attractions will be delisted. TripAdvisor still wants travellers to be able to share their feedback about the attractions, good or bad. Although TripAdvisor is aiming to put pressure on the industry to end the captivity of future generations of cetaceans, the new policy does not include a ban on ticket sales to attractions with animals already in captivity. After a consultation process with experts, including marine biologists, zoologists and conservationists, TripAdvisor says that for the current population of cetaceans in captivity, \u201crelease into the wild is not a realistic option\u201d. \u201cScience has revealed the immense suffering and early mortality imposed upon cetaceans exploited for captive public display. These facilities can also threaten real conservation efforts to save these animals in the wild,\u201d said Toni Frohoff, a cetacean behavioural biologist from Terramar Research. \u201cNow that we know better, we should do better, and not support these facilities by visiting them.\u201d Conservation groups, some of whom were consulted on the policy, have largely welcomed the move as an important step forward in tourism and animal welfare. \u201cThis sends a clear message to other travel companies that we must end this cruel industry once and for all,\u201d said Nick Stewart, World Animal Protection\u2019s global head of campaign. \u201cTogether we can ensure this is the last generation of dolphins held captive for entertainment.\u201d Other organisations called on TripAdivsor to ensure strict criteria to only allow the promotion of true sanctuaries, and strengthen its animal welfare further still. \u201cWith its global influence on holidaymakers and the tourism industry, this action will no doubt have a significant impact on the captive-cetacean industry,\u201d said Nicola O\u2019Brien, campaigns director for Freedom for Animals. \u201cWe would now urge TripAdvisor to take this action further, and extend this commitment to facilities that exploit many different species for entertainment.\u201d The announcement is the next step in TripAdvisor\u2019s animal welfare policy, which first launched in 2016. This already includes a ban on tickets sales to any experiences where travellers come into physical contact with captive wild animals. In 2018, it also banned ticket sales to attractions that included \u201cdemeaning animal shows and performances\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Seven West Media\u2019s flagship current affairs show Sunday Night: True Stories will be axed as part of a major restructure at the media company. Melissa Doyle, a former co-host of breakfast show Sunrise who has hosted Sunday Night since 2015, will retain her news reading roles at the network. The tabloid TV Sunday evening program was created 10 years ago to challenge Nine\u2019s 60 Minutes, and occasionally it did out-rate it, but the original has outlasted its rival. Some weeks this year Sunday Night had less than half the ratings of 60 Minutes. Sunday Night, which was recently rebranded Sunday Night: True Stories, had a string of executive producers since 2009 including Adam Boland, Mark Llewellyn, Steve Taylor and Hamish Thomson. Thomson left the program several months ago. It was originally hosted by Chris Bath and Mike Munro. The program was no stranger to chequebook journalism, paying Barnaby Joyce and Vikki Campion reportedly as much as $150,000 to talk about their affair. Seven\u2019s head of news and current affairs, Craig McPherson, said the program would remain on air until the end of the year with a skeleton staff. \u201cAfter 11 years at the forefront of our public affairs offering it is with much sadness I announce the closing down of the day to day operations of Sunday Night: True Stories,\u201d McPherson said. \u201cI want to thank the exceptional team of reporters; producers; camera operators; editors and many others who have helped produce more than 500 hours of quality public affairs programming over its lifetime.\u201d The wider restructure was unveiled on Wednesday morning by the new chief executive and managing director, James Warburton, who replaced Seven West Media CEO Tim Worner last month. Warburton told staff he was introducing \u201ca leaner and more agile company\u201d with a \u201cflatter structure\u201d. Last month\u2019s financial results revealed a loss of almost $445m, down from a profit of $134m the previous year. Warburton criticised the former management for failing to invest in programming and and \u201cholding us back from growth and leadership\u201d. \u201cWith the new organisational structure, we have focussed on simplifying the [Seven West Media] organisation to enable our content-led growth strategy,\u201d Warburton said. \u201cThis new flatter structure will cement our position as Australia\u2019s leading media group with content at the heart of the business, digital growth maximised, duplication of roles removed in all areas and operating efficiencies implemented. \u201cWe have had to make some tough decisions in order to build the network for the future. I take very seriously any decision that impacts our people and I am grateful for the loyalty and commitment shown by our team over many years. Anyone impacted by changes will have dedicated support and respect throughout the process of transition\u201d. Executives who have already left the company include corporate spokesperson Stephen Browning and the head of sport, Saul Shtein. A new chief content officer, chief marketing officer and chief digital officer will be part of the eight-member executive reporting to Warburton. A former Seven chief digital and sales officer, Warburton was sacked as managing director by the Ten board in 2013 when Lachlan Murdoch was the chairman.",

Two others accused of murdering western hostages \u2013 Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh \u2013 may be extradited to the US. Two British MPs who went on a fact-finding mission to north-east Syria last month, including a visit to a refugee camp, said the UK had a \u201cdebt of honour\u201d to help those who fought Isis on the ground, and said the situation in the prisons and camps was critical. Lloyd Russell-Moyle, a Labour MP who chairs the parliamentary group on north-east Syria, said the local authorities needed western help: \u201cThe time bomb of captured Isis fighters and radicalised families is beyond the capacity of north-east Syria to address. Failure to prioritise this would be international security negligence of the first order.\u201d The MPs also criticised the UK for not recognising north-east Syria politically, with ministers refusing to meet administration officials when they visited London earlier this year.

The US, which has 1,000 troops in the region, is opposed to the creation of a local war crime tribunal. It wants foreign fighters to be repatriated and put on trial in their home countries. Whitehall sources argue that problems with collecting evidence that could stand up in a British court mean it may only be possible to charge returnees with membership of a banned organisation, which carries a maximum 10-year sentence. Control of refugee camps, such as al-Hawl, is increasingly in the hands of \u201cradical women\u201d from Tunisia, Somalia and Russia. On their recent visit, the MPs heard aid workers report that their tents were burned down and they are regularly pelted with stones. Sixteen British families are among the 12,700 people from outside Syria and Iraq living in al-Hawl, according to the local administration, though there is limited evidence that any sustained effort has been made to establish details about who is in the camp. \u201cThey haven\u2019t done any fingerprinting or any ID,\u201d one of the British politicians said. Conservative dress codes were strictly enforced. Members of the SDF guarding the camp said a mother killed her daughter with a hammer for not wearing the chador and her body was left out in the camp as a warning to others. Local politicians said the UK and other countries should be prepared to repatriate children born to Isis members, as part of a deradicalisation programme. \u201cThese children are victims, their only guilt is that they belong to parents who joined Isis,\u201d Omar said. Describing the children in the camp, who are from 55 countries beyond Syria and Iraq, as \u201cthe cubs of the caliphate\u201d, Omar said: \u201cIf we do not address this problem and provide rehabilitation for some of them, we expect a future of terrorists.\u201d Some countries, such as France and Belgium, have taken in a few orphaned children, but a recent review led by the Home Office concluded that children in Syria with a claim to British citizenship should be left there. Over the weekend, however, it was reported that Johnson was considering whether to authorise a raid by UK special forces to repatriate children born to British parents.",

While sameness can create cohesion, cookie-cutter teams can\u2019t successfully compete with diverse teams that can draw on a broad range of talents, perspectives and insights. At least that\u2019s what empirical data from lefty organisations including <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/why-diversity-matters\">McKinsey</a>, <a href=\"https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us-news/en/articles/media-releases/42035-201207.html\">Credit Suisse</a> and <a href=\"https://blogs.imf.org/2018/11/28/economic-gains-from-gender-inclusion-even-greater-than-you-thought/\">the IMF</a> have to say.</p> <p>But facts have a well-known leftwing bias, so maybe a sporting analogy will help. The Men\u2019s Rugby World Cup is now being played in Japan. Being a men\u2019s competition, the teams are comprised solely of blokes, but there is still an incredible diversity in the physical and performance attributes of players involved. The tallest player, Rory Arnold, is 6 foot 10 inches while the shortest player, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/17/sports/rugby/short-players-rugby-world-cup.html\">Fumiaki Tanaka of Japan, is 5 foot 5 inches</a>. Some players have more than a decade of representative experience, while others are new to the World Cup. Some are fast, some are strong, some can really kick and some can really jump. The only thing that can be said for certain is that the team that wins the Rugby World Cup will not be full of clones of the \u201cideal player\u201d.</p> <p>There are lots of reasons why our parliaments, our company boards and our media feed should be as diverse as the communities that we live in. The main one is fairness. Most Australians aren\u2019t white men between 50 and 70 years old (though I almost am!) but many of our most important institutions are chock full of men who fit that bill. Indeed, there are <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-03-08/fewer-women-ceos-than-men-named-john/8327938\">more men named John who run big companies in Australia than there are women</a>. And more men named Peter. And David.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/aug/15/australias-creative-industry-is-shockingly-white-but-dont-be-discouraged\">Australia's creative industry is shockingly white. Don't be discouraged | Beverley Wang</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Given that there is no evidence that men or Caucasians are more intelligent, creative or strategic than women or people of other races, it is inconceivable that the current gender and racial distribution of powerful positions is based on merit. Fairness alone requires this problem to be fixed.</p> <p>And then there is performance. Lest I invite the full fury of the rightwing commentariat for talking beyond my expertise, it\u2019s probably best that I simply quote the virtue signallers from the <a href=\"https://blogs.imf.org/2018/11/28/economic-gains-from-gender-inclusion-even-greater-than-you-thought/\">International Monetary Fund who concluded that</a>: \u201cOur analysis springs from the observation \u2013 supported by considerable microeconomic evidence \u2013 that women and men bring different skills and perspectives to the workplace, including different attitudes to risk and collaboration. Studies have also shown that the financial performance of firms improves with more gender-equal corporate boards.\u201d</p> <p>Achieving diversity among our leaders isn\u2019t a purely progressive objective. Even Scott Morrison agrees, in principle, that <a href=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/scott-morrison-wants-greater-female-representation/news-story/160fe3888839e6b11704ec8fbb088778\">his party needs to recruit more women into parliament</a>. But, much like his \u201cin-principle\u201d commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, he simply hasn\u2019t been able to achieve much progress on gender equity yet.</p> <p>The main reason that we need diversity in our leaders is that our leaders are more than the sum of the decisions they make on our behalf.

      "bodyText": "Teams full of similar people underperform. While sameness can create cohesion, cookie-cutter teams can\u2019t successfully compete with diverse teams that can draw on a broad range of talents, perspectives and insights. At least that\u2019s what empirical data from lefty organisations including McKinsey, Credit Suisse and the IMF have to say. But facts have a well-known leftwing bias, so maybe a sporting analogy will help. The Men\u2019s Rugby World Cup is now being played in Japan. Being a men\u2019s competition, the teams are comprised solely of blokes, but there is still an incredible diversity in the physical and performance attributes of players involved. The tallest player, Rory Arnold, is 6 foot 10 inches while the shortest player, Fumiaki Tanaka of Japan, is 5 foot 5 inches. Some players have more than a decade of representative experience, while others are new to the World Cup. Some are fast, some are strong, some can really kick and some can really jump. The only thing that can be said for certain is that the team that wins the Rugby World Cup will not be full of clones of the \u201cideal player\u201d. There are lots of reasons why our parliaments, our company boards and our media feed should be as diverse as the communities that we live in. The main one is fairness. Most Australians aren\u2019t white men between 50 and 70 years old (though I almost am!) but many of our most important institutions are chock full of men who fit that bill. Indeed, there are more men named John who run big companies in Australia than there are women. And more men named Peter. And David. Given that there is no evidence that men or Caucasians are more intelligent, creative or strategic than women or people of other races, it is inconceivable that the current gender and racial distribution of powerful positions is based on merit. Fairness alone requires this problem to be fixed. And then there is performance. Lest I invite the full fury of the rightwing commentariat for talking beyond my expertise, it\u2019s probably best that I simply quote the virtue signallers from the International Monetary Fund who concluded that: \u201cOur analysis springs from the observation \u2013 supported by considerable microeconomic evidence \u2013 that women and men bring different skills and perspectives to the workplace, including different attitudes to risk and collaboration. Studies have also shown that the financial performance of firms improves with more gender-equal corporate boards.\u201d Achieving diversity among our leaders isn\u2019t a purely progressive objective. Even Scott Morrison agrees, in principle, that his party needs to recruit more women into parliament. But, much like his \u201cin-principle\u201d commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, he simply hasn\u2019t been able to achieve much progress on gender equity yet. The main reason that we need diversity in our leaders is that our leaders are more than the sum of the decisions they make on our behalf. Leaders, via their behaviour and their identity, say something important about the organisations they represent, and about our society. Which brings me to Greta Thunberg. There is no doubt that older white men have a dominant voice in the Australian media landscape. And there is also no doubt that some of the loudest of those white male voices expressed the most outrage that a young woman was given a global platform on which to speak. Much has been written about why so many old conservative men felt so angry that a young woman would speak truth to power. But what sticks out for me is that the Australian men who raged the loudest claim to do exactly what Thunberg dared to do. You\u2019d think they would at least applaud her chutzpah. Alan Jones doesn\u2019t let titles like premier or prime minister stop him tearing shreds off guests who are brave enough to come on his show but are not \u201cgood enough\u201d to meet the standards he sets for them. Likewise, Andrew Bolt. Whether it was the Liberal prime minister Malcolm Turnbull or the Labor prime minister Julia Gillard, Bolt has felt free to let the world know whenever a politician or business leader doesn\u2019t live up to his expectations. But how dare a young woman hold elected leaders to the same account. How dare a \u201cchild\u201d, a \u201cbrat\u201d, a mere \u201cgirl\u201d have the same sense of entitlement to express her judgment as the old codgers? A former AFL player called Sam Newman asked: \u201cWHO lets this shit have a platform? Mendacious, inbred sycophants, that\u2019s who. #ClimateChangeHoax.\u201d Who indeed. Maybe the 500,000 people who turned up at the march she led in Montreal? Maybe the 300,000 Australians who followed her lead and joined the climate strike last month? But let\u2019s flip the question. Who gives former football players a loud voice in debates about climate change? Who gives Alan Jones the right to use violent language against female politicians?

But the world \u2013 and Australia \u2013 is gradually changing, even if the loudest voices are not. It took 119 years to overturn the New South Wales law against abortion and, when it finally happened, conservative Coalition MPs complained that the process was \u201crushed\u201d. Similarly, it was conservative Coalition MPs who thought we \u201crushed\u201d the equal marriage decision too.

One of the most important roles our leaders play is to decide which problems are urgent and which can wait. Scott Morrison\u2019s Coalition wants to prevent the use of the term \u201calmond milk\u201d and inquire into discrimination against men in the family courts.

Aaron Drovandi, from James Cook University, Queensland, conducts research into tobacco control and surveyed more than 2,000 smokers and non-smokers about how effective current and novel approaches to encourage people to quit or not start smoking are. He found that although a significant number of Australians in recent decades no longer smoke, current strategies including plain packaging on cigarette packets were less effective for smokers.

It was unclear whether Pompeo had been warned of Linick\u2019s move. Since Democrats announced the impeachment inquiry last week, the foreign affairs, intelligence and oversight committees have wasted little time in seeking documents and testimonies. The committee chairs, Eliot Engel, Adam Schiff, and Elijah Cummings, dismissed Pompeo\u2019s criticisms. \u201cAny effort to intimidate witnesses or prevent them from talking with Congress \u2013 including state department employees \u2013 is illegal and will constitute evidence of obstruction of the impeachment inquiry,\u201d they said in a joint statement. \u201cIn response, Congress may infer from this obstruction that any withheld documents and testimony would reveal information that corroborates the whistleblower complaint.\u201d Pompeo was assailed on Tuesday by former officials who saw hypocrisy in his expressions of concern over intimidation of foreign service officers.

In a series of tweets late Tuesday evening, Trump said efforts by Democrats amounted to \u201ca COUP\u201d. In issuing a separate subpoena last week as part of the impeachment inquiry, the chairmen of three committees made it clear stonewalling would be considered obstruction of Congress. The expanding Ukraine scandal is threatening to engulf one of the president\u2019s most loyal enforcers.

Gorka is a hardline nationalist and former editor for the far-right Breitbart News. He has vehemently denounced the impeachment inquiry. Trump is also defying political norms by accusing opponents of treason and making threats to the intelligence community whistleblower who raised concerns about the Zelenskiy call. In an earlier round of volatile tweets on Tuesday, Trump had wondered why he was not \u201centitled to interview [and] learn everything about\u201d the whistleblower, whose identity is protected by law. The president also repeated his claim that the July call was \u201cPERFECT\u201d, adding: \u201cThis is just another Fake News Media, together with their partner, the Democrat Party, HOAX!\u201d But the Republican senator Chuck Grassley told reporters the whistleblower \u201cought to be heard out and protected\u201d and requests for confidentiality should be respected. The crisis has also cast a harsh spotlight on the attorney general, William Barr. The Washington Post revealed that he held private meetings overseas with foreign intelligence officials, seeking their help in a justice department investigation Trump hopes will undermine his own intelligence agencies\u2019 conclusions about Russian interference in the 2016 election.

      "bodyText": "NAB says it will set aside an additional $1.2bn to compensate victims of shoddy financial advice provided by planners linked to the bank and people to whom it sold junk insurance. The new costs, announced to the stock exchange on Wednesday, bring NAB\u2019s total provisions for remediation to more than $2bn and will increase the pressure on other banks to step up their programs. Costs have ballooned because the bank has discovered that the amount it has to refund customers for behaviour dating back as far as a decade is higher than it first expected. The headline figure includes both compensation for customers and the cost of running the remediation schemes. NAB bore the brunt of much of the fallout from last year\u2019s banking royal commission, which followed years of scandals involving customers being systematically dudded by the finance sector. The bank\u2019s chief executive, Andrew Thorburn, and it chairman, former Treasury secretary Ken Henry, both resigned after they were criticised by commissioner Kenneth Hayne in his final report in February. By taking the $2bn hit all at once, new chief executive Philip Chronican is now trying to put the bank\u2019s torrid history behind it and draw a clear distinction between his regime and that of his predecessor. \u201cNAB is moving forward with rigour and discipline to make things right for customers,\u201d Chronican said. \u201cWe understand that shareholders will be rightly disappointed. However, we also recognise the need to prioritise dealing with these past issues and fixing them for customers.\u201d NAB now expects it will have to refund customers who were damaged by so-called \u201caligned advisers\u201d, who ran their own businesses giving advice but used the bank\u2019s financial services license, more than half of the $13bn that was paid in fees since 2009. It said it would also have to increase refunds to customers of advisers who worked directly to the bank to almost 40% of what they paid. And it also needed to increase remediation to people who bought consumer credit insurance, which is supposed to cover repayments of credit card, home loans or personal loans when the borrower falls ill, loses their job or dies but is often completely worthless. NAB also said it would take an additional hit of $350m after revaluing its computer software. The bank\u2019s shares were down 2.8%, to $28.87, shortly before midday on Wednesday.",

      "bodyText": "The British government has expressed regret for the killing of M\u0101ori people in New Zealand after the explorer Captain James Cook\u2019s arrival in the country in 1769. But the statement from the British high commissioner to New Zealand, Laura Clarke, to local tribes \u2013 known as iwi \u2013 was made in private and stopped short of an apology. The meetings with iwi in the city of Gisborne, on the east coast of New Zealand\u2019s North Island, came days before a government-funded commemoration of Cook\u2019s landing there, including a replica of his sailing ship along with a flotilla of other vessels. The anniversary events have been decried by some M\u0101ori groups as insensitive and protests are expected at this weekend\u2019s events. When the British explorer arrived on the east side of the Turanganui River, near present-day Gisborne, the first encounter between his men and the M\u0101ori inhabitants was disastrous, according to an official New Zealand history site, with a leader from the Ng\u0101ti Oneone group immediately shot and killed. It seemed likely the local people were undertaking a ceremonial challenge, which the Europeans misunderstood, the site said. At least eight other M\u0101ori are believed to have been killed. The British high commission said in its statement that Cook had written of his regret over the deaths in his diary. Speaking to the Guardian from Gisborne, Clarke described the meeting as \u201cemotional\u201d on all sides, with tears shed by all. Iwi groups have been in negotiations with Clarke on reconciliation for more than nine months, and the event marks a new beginning for relations between the British government and M\u0101ori people, the high commissioner said. \u201cWhat we did today, really acknowledged, perhaps properly for the first time, that nine people and nine ancestors were killed in those first meetings between Captain Cook and New Zealand M\u0101ori, and that is not how any of us would have wanted those first encounters to have happened,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it\u2019s a really significant part of our shared history, and a sad one, so it felt really important to acknowledge that pain of those first encounters. Acknowledge that the pain doesn\u2019t diminish over time, and if you do that, if you look back to address the wrongs of the past, it equips you better I think to look to the future and build a partnership.\u201d Clarke said her team had been \u201creally focused\u201d on acknowledging past wrongs between Cook and M\u0101ori people and there were as yet no plans to make further efforts at formal reconciliations with iwi groups around the country. \u201cThat meeting of Cook and M\u0101ori marks the beginning of modern Aotearoa [the M\u0101ori name for the country] New Zealand so it was really a important first encounter and it went tragically wrong and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to recognise. So it\u2019s very focused on this one historic incident and very focused on this relationship between the UK and the descendants of those who were killed,\u201d she said. Iwi groups applauded Clarke\u2019s diplomatic efforts and described her public expressions of sympathy and regret as sincere and profound, saying they were enough for now to begin the healing process. Only a small handful of official statements have been made by the UK government about its actions overseas during the colonial period. In 2013, it expressed regret and announced compensation payments for those tortured in prison during Kenya\u2019s Mau Mau insurgency. And earlier this year, on the 100th anniversary of the Amritsar massacre in India, in which British troops fired on crowds, killing 379 according to official figures, the government expressed \u201cdeep regret\u201d \u2013 but again stopped short of an official apology. Clarke was appointed to Wellington in January 2018 and has since spoken admiringly of the push towards \u201crighting past wrongs\u201d in the treatment of M\u0101ori by New Zealand governments and the UK. She is learning te reo M\u0101ori (the M\u0101ori language) and last year the high commission recruited its first adviser on M\u0101ori affairs. Meng Foon, New Zealand\u2019s race relations commissioner and a former mayor of Gisborne, told Radio New Zealand the British statement was significant and he hoped it would help iwi move forward. But Tina Ngata, a M\u0101ori rights advocate who has been leading the opposition to the commemorations of Cook\u2019s arrival, said words were not enough without change. Last month, she told Radio New Zealand that Cook was \u201ca murderer, he was an invader [and] he was a vanguard for British imperial expansion\u201d. The New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, will visit Gisborne at the weekend for the official commemorations but will not participate in Wednesday\u2019s expression of regret.",

      "bodyText": "After wading on to the world\u2019s highest rating political reality TV set, Scott Morrison returns from his big week in the US with a mixed reception from the viewers back home. As he bro-ed up with The Donald and danced around Washington and neighbouring states, most Australians recognised he was playing his designated role. Maybe a tad too ebullient, but still. Whether he was running point at an Ohio rally or sitting rod-straight with a fixed grimace while Trump went commando at a photo op, the prime minister managed to navigate the circus without getting eaten by the lions. The response of the Australian public reinforces the idea that while we may not love Trump, being able to manage the US alliance is seen as a core part of the PM\u2019s job description. As this week\u2019s Guardian Essential Report shows, we are not about to vote him out of the House for his performance this week. The results will deflate and likely infuriate those on the progressive side of politics, for whom engagement with Trump is seen as some sort of communicative disease. First, Australians overwhelmingly think the relationship with the US is more important than who the occupant of the White House is. Second, despite the \u201cmaaates\u201d and the mayhem, most voters rate the PM\u2019s diplomacy skills positively. While it should be noted that these figures pre-date the revelations of the president\u2019s call for assistance, they show the public has a nuanced view of Trump. And while just one-third of Australians believe the Trump presidency has been good for Australia, that does not mean that a good relationship with Morrison reflects poorly on him. What to make of these results? A bit like reality TV I think it shows it is easy to get caught up in the colour and noise of the show and lose sight of the fact that most of the drama is confected for the audience. Even when you focus on the latest outrage of Trump linking aid money to political dirt-digging of a domestic opponent, the impact is high on outrage and much lower on real-life consequence. For many of us the White House sideshow, while unedifying, is less confronting than Chinese troops clamping down on democracy protesters in Hong Kong, satellite images of Uighur labour camps, and local headlines of the increased influence of Chinese money in local politics. In terms of separating the performance from the real world, it seems we are prepared to keep Trump in a sideshow alley. Indeed it was in the real world where Australians marked Morrison down, with 70% believing he should have ponied up to the UN climate conference and taken responsibility for his government\u2019s inaction. As these figures show, even Coalition supporters think Morrison dogged it in skipping the UN talks even while he was in the neighbourhood, instead indulging in the sort of distortions of the facts that would make it into Trump\u2019s Twitter feed. Instead of employing some Trumpian truth manipulation on Australia\u2019s tremendous performance on emissions and picking fights with 16-year-olds, most Australians think that part of the PM\u2019s job is being part of the global response to the looming climate crisis. Embedded in these contrasting results lies a warning: while we don\u2019t mind you meeting with Trump and even playing along with the craziness for a bit, we really don\u2019t want you to become him. \u2022 Peter Lewis is an executive director of Essential.

A retired social worker and climate campaigner, Naomi Leslie Hall, and the unsuccessful independent candidate for Kooyong, Oliver Yates, have brought the challenges to the election of Liu and Frydenberg, arguing the signs infringed electoral law provisions banning conduct that \u201cmisleads or deceives an elector in relation to the casting of a vote\u201d. The Australian Electoral Commission inspected the signs on election day, 18 May, and noted they contained an authorisation by Frost, as required by electoral law.

Both disputed that Liberal corflutes used \u201cthe same colour scheme as was used by the AEC\u201d, arguing it was merely \u201csimilar\u201d to the AEC\u2019s, and submitted that \u201cother parties have used purple and white signs on polling booths\u201d in the 2019 and previous elections.

Nothing could be inferred from her attendance except that \u201cshe saw the corflute on polling day\u201d, her defence said.

Both denied that as a result of the signs it is likely some voters voted for the Liberal candidates \u201cnotwithstanding that such was not the vote that they otherwise intended to cast\u201d, rejecting claims the signs affected the result.

Without the fundraising surge, Demissie said: \u201cWe would have had enough money to survive but not to grow.\u201d</p> <p>While the campaign is still counting checks and tallying totals, Demissie said it has raised more than $6m this quarter.

      "bodyText": "Secretary of state Mike Pompeo vowed to block testimony from witnesses that he claims are being rushed and bullied onto Capitol Hill. House democrats postponed the first of a series depositions related to the Ukraine affair. Former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who was to meet with the House Intelligence Committee tomorrow, will instead meet on October 11. But former envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, will attend his deposition on Thursday as scheduled. Democratic congressional chairmen warned against anyone trying to obstruct their impeachment inquiry by stopping witnesses from testifying. Donald Trump\u2019s campaign and the Republican National Committee raised a record $125m in the third quarter of this year. The reelection campaign has ramped up spending on attack ads deriding House democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. Democratic candidates announced their third-quarter fundraising numbers as well. Bernie Sanders raised $25m, Pete Buttigieg raised $19 million, Kamala Harris raised $11.6 m and Corey Booker raised about $6m. Former congressman Chris Collins, pleaded guilty in an insider trading case that the republican representative from New York had previously dismissed as \u201cfake news\u201d The state department\u2019s inspector general has requested an urgent briefing related to documents on Ukraine with congressional staff members, according to multiple reports. The inspector general\u2019s unusual request followed secretary of state Mike Pompeo\u2019s assertions that House democrats were trying to \u201cbully\u201d officials into testifying and that the democrats\u2019 schedule for depositions related to the Trump-Ukraine impeachment inquiry was \u201cnot feasible\u201d. Inspector general Steve Linick said he is holding a briefing because his office had obtained documents from the acting legal adviser in the state department, according to CNN. It\u2019s unclear what exactly will be revealed at the closed meeting scheduled for tomorrow. Representative Maxine Waters has tweeted that Donald Trump should be \u201cimprisoned &amp; placed in solitary confinement.\u201d Waters, a democrat from California who chairs the House financial services committee, wrote that \u201cimpeachment is not enough.\u201d Waters has often been an outspoken critic of Trump. A federal judge has temporarily blocked one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the country. A Georgia law banning abortion after a fetal heartbeat can be detected has been put on hold until a broader challenge to laws like it -- passed by Republican-led legislatures around the country this year -- is worked out. A fetal heartbeat can usually be detected after about six weeks before many women are aware that they are pregnant. Georgia\u2019s law would impose penalties including jail time for abortion providers and confer full legal rights on fetuses. The law, which was due to take effect in January, would exempt cases that involve rape or incest if the woman files a police report and cases in which the mother\u2019s life is endangered. In August, a federal judge blocked a similar law in Missouri blocking abortions after eight weeks except in cases of a medical emergency. Other abortion restrictions in Alabama, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Ohio have either been blocked or are being challenged in court. Planned Parenthood Southeast was one of several groups that challenged the law in Georgia. \u201cTo the countless Georgians who spoke out against this ban and were ignored, we promised to keep fighting every step of the way and we have,\u201d said Staci Fox, president of Planned Parenthood Southeast, in a statement. NYT: Trump talked about fortifying the border wall with snakes or alligators Based on interviews with more than a dozen anonymous sources within the administration reporters from the New York Times have illustrated Donald Trump\u2019s \u201czeal to stop immigration\u201d and fortify the US-Mexico border wall: The Oval Office meeting this past March began, as so many had, with President Trump fuming about migrants. But this time he had a solution. As White House advisers listened astonished, he ordered them to shut down the entire 2,000-mile border with Mexico \u2014 by noon the next day. The advisers feared the president\u2019s edict would trap American tourists in Mexico, strand children at schools on both sides of the border and create an economic meltdown in two countries. Yet they also knew how much the president\u2019s zeal to stop immigration had sent him lurching for solutions, one more extreme than the next. Privately, the president had often talked about fortifying a border wall with a water-filled trench, stocked with snakes or alligators, prompting aides to seek a cost estimate. He wanted the wall electrified, with spikes on top that could pierce human flesh. After publicly suggesting that soldiers shoot migrants if they threw rocks, the president backed off when his staff told him that was illegal. But later in a meeting, aides recalled, he suggested that they shoot migrants in the legs to slow them down. That\u2019s not allowed either, they told him The report published in the Times is an excerpt from reporters Michael D. Shear and Julie Hirschfeld Davis\u2019s upcoming book Border Wars: Inside Trump\u2019s Assault on Immigration. The Trump reelection campaign and the Republican National Committee raised $125 million in the third quarter of the year. Altogether, the campaign has raised more than $308 million in 2019 and has more than $156 million in the bank. By contrast, Barack Obama and the DNC raised about $70 million in the third quarter of 2011. Last week, after House democrats announced their impeachment inquiry, the president\u2019s reelection campaign announced that it would dedicate millions to attack ads. The campaign spent $1.1 million within a week on just Facebook, according to ABC News. The messaging no Facebook echoed Trump, warning voters, \u201cIf Democrats outraise us, they will be able to dominate the airwaves with their crazy IMPEACHMENT WITCH HUNT.\u201d \u201cWe are investing millions on the airwaves and on the ground to hold House Democrats accountable, highlight their obstruction, and take back the House and reelect President Trump in 2020, RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel told the AP. Harris fundraising figures are out Democratic party 2020 candidate Kamala Harris announced her campaign raised $11.6 million during the third quarter of this year, from July through September. The amount is in line with what Harris raised in the first two quarters of the year, showing that Harris may not be getting the traction she needs to beat out Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren, who\u2019ve been dominating the polls, Lauren Aratani writes. Democratic candidates have been announcing their third quarter fundraising numbers throughout the day. Along with the polls, the numbers are an indicator of success for candidates in a crowded field that\u2019s slowly shrinking. Bernie Sanders leads the pack so far with $25m raised \u2013 his best quarter so far during this campaign. Pete Buttigieg raised $19 million, slightly down from last quarter but still wildly impressive for a mayor of a small-town. Biden and Warren are expected to out-raise Harris as well. Harris beat out Corey Booker, whose campaign made a desperate push for $1.7 million in the last 10-days of the quarter. The push got the candidate more than $2 million in 10 days, totaling more than $6 million for the quarter. Politico reported yesterday that Harris is shaking up her campaign staff team, promoting her Senate senior chief of staff and top advisor to leadership roles on her campaign team. Aides say the campaign has lacked coordination, not holding staff meetings until September, for example. Harris earlier this afternoon demanded that secretary of state Mike Pompeo must be called to testify about his role in the phone call between Donald Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and its aftermath. Kurt Volker will be the first witness deposed in Trump-Ukraine impeachment inquiry Even after secretary of state Mike Pompeo warned that his officials wouldn\u2019t comply with House democrats deposition, they appear to be complying The former special envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, who stepped down last week will be appearing at his deposition on Thursday as planned, according to CNN. On Friday, House democrats sent Pompeo a list of five officials in his department that they intend to depose in relation to the Trump-Ukraine impeachment inquiry. But Pompeo said that requested dates for officials to voluntarily to appear on Capitol Hill for depositions were \u201cnot feasible.\u201d But it appears that Volker, at least, is sticking to the Democrats\u2019 schedule. Volker played a direct role in arranging meetings between Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, and Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, according to congressional committee chairmen leading the impeachment inquiry. The Guardian has not independently verified CNN\u2019s reporting. There\u2019s no sign that the drama in US politics today is going to slow down. I\u2019m signing off from the east coast now and my colleague in California, Maanvi Singh, will take you through the next few hours. Here are the main events so far today: College students in the latest opinion poll chose Elizabeth Warren to be their president, with Donald Trump coming second, then Bernie Sanders, then Joe Biden. Former congressman Chris Collins pleaded guilty in a court in New York to charges in an insider trading case he\u2019d previously dismissed as \u201cfake news\u201d. His son is expected to follow suit tomorrow. Three top Democratic congressional chairmen have warned against anyone trying to impede witnesses testifying in Washington, lest it be taken as evidence of obstructing an impeachment inquiry. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo vowed to block testimony from witnesses that he claims are being rushed and bullied onto Capitol Hill. Who\u2019s the bully? David Axelrod, former chief strategist to Barack Obama during his presidency, is miffed at Donald Trump\u2019s secretary of state Mike Pompeo earlier today crying \u201cbully\u201d over congressional committee chairmen calling former and current state department officials to Capitol Hill. The committees want the officials to testify as part of the Trump-Ukraine impeachment inquiry now roaring forward in Washington. Here\u2019s his tweet: Look out Joe Biden. A new survey finds that Elizabeth Warren is the top 2020 choice among college students, according to a new College Reaction/Axios opinion poll. But she\u2019s not just first pick among Democrats racing for their party\u2019s nomination next year, she\u2019s first among candidates of both parties - ie she beat Donald Trump. But the sitting president didn\u2019t do too shabbily - he came second. Warren topped the poll with 19.5% support, then came Trump with 17.4% support. Both had increased their share of student joy since the summer. Third was Bernie Sanders with 15.5% and Joe Biden was fourth with 13.1%, both having lost some support among this sample population in recent weeks. Fascinatingly, the poll was conducted September 23 and 24. The blurb doesn\u2019t say until what time the students were questioned on the 24th because, of course, it was at 5PM in Washington, DC, that day that Nancy Pelosi formally launched the impeachment inquiry into Trump. Expectation had been building all day that she would, but it\u2019s impossible to know if that influenced the poll outcome at all. I guess we\u2019ll see next time around. \u2018Liddle Fuzzball\u2019 is in the White House A little furry friend has been keeping pool reporters company in the White House briefing room today, causing a mini fiasco in the normally subdued room, Lauren Aratani writes. NBC reporter Peter Alexander first tweeted that a mouse \u201cliterally fell out of the ceiling in our White House booth and landed on my lap\u201d. A reporter-led hunt for the mouse, which has been nicknamed \u201cLiddle Fuzzball\u201d \u2013 a play on \u201cLiddle Adam Schitt\u201d, Donald Trump\u2019s nickname for House intelligence committee chairman Adam Schiff \u2013 ensued but has apparently been unsuccessful. White House staff have reportedly been asking journalists to quickly close the doors behind them when exiting the briefing room for fear that the mouse will escape elsewhere in the West Wing. Perhaps it\u2019s unsurprising that the briefing room has succumb to rodents \u2013 it\u2019s been over six months since someone stood at the lectern in the briefing room. Stephanie Grisham, who took over Sarah Sanders\u2019 post as Trump\u2019s press secretary in July, has yet to hold a press conference. It\u2019s become clear that Trump prefers \u201cchopper talk\u201d \u2013 talking to reports directly when out and about, and leaving the official remarks to the mice in the room. The now former Republican congressman Chris Collins pleaded guilty today in a court in Manhattan to charges stemming from an insider trading case. The plea came a day after he resigned and set off a scramble to fill his seat in his Republican-leaning district, New York 27, in the western part of the state, bordering Lakes Ontario and Erie. Collins had initially denied charges, the Associated Press writes, that he leaked confidential information about a pharmaceutical company. He was set to go to trial next year in federal court in Manhattan on conspiracy, securities fraud and other charges. After his plea, Collins expressed regret and said he had failed his constituents. With Collin\u2019s departure, it will be up to Democratic governor Andrew Cuomo to set a special election to replace him. The governor said in radio interview earlier today that the timing remains uncertain for an election that\u2019s expected to now draw even more candidates to an already crowded field. \u201cThe question is, when can I do it?\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cBut sooner rather than later is my inclination.\u201d The case against the 69-year-old Collins stemmed from his business dealings with Innate Immunotherapeutics Ltd., a biotechnology company headquartered in Sydney, Australia. He was the company\u2019s largest shareholder and sat on its board. According to the indictment, Collins was attending the Congressional Picnic at the White House in 2017 when he received an email from the company\u2019s chief executive saying that a drug developed to treat multiple sclerosis had proven to be a clinical failure. The next morning, according to the indictment, his son Cameron Collins began selling his shares, unloading enough over a two-day period to avoid $570,900 in losses before a public announcement of the drug trial results. After the announcement, the company\u2019s stock price plunged 92%. Cameron Collins is expected to plead guilty tomorrow. Chris Collins had spent months decrying \u201cfake news\u201d about reports of his crimes. The Buffalo News reports today on that and other colorful details of the pol\u2019s downfall. Hillary Clinton backs impeachment of Trump Hillary Clinton has been basking in the glow of what appears to be her sweet karma. Clinton has been on the media circuit the last few days promoting a book she wrote with her daughter, Chelsea Clinton, and responding to questions about the impeachment inquiry with praise, Lauren Aratani writes. \u201cIs it time to, dare I say, lock him up, lock him up, lock him up?\u201d Stephen Colbert asked Clinton on his show, the Late Show with Stephen Colbert, last night, mocking the chant that Trump created against Clinton during his 2016 campaign. The audience joined in on the chants as Clinton laughed at the reference. Clinton said that she supports Nancy Pelosi\u2019s decision to start an impeachment inquiry. The former secretary of state previously cautioned Democrats against pursuing impeachment. \u201cIt\u2019s a serious undertaking. Do not pursue it for trivial political purposes. \u2026 Restrain yourself from grandstanding and holding news conferences and playing to your base,\u201d she said in an interview in July. On the Late Show, however, Clinton said that an impeachment inquiry is now \u201cexactly what should be done\u201d. The Ukraine scandal has had \u201csuch a huge impact because we\u2019ve known for a long time that he was a corrupt businessman who cheated people,\u201d Clinton told Colbert. \u201cTo see him in the office of the president putting his personal and political interests ahead of the national security of our country just pierced through whatever confusion and denial people had.\u201d Clinton repeated her stance on ABC\u2019s network show Good Morning America today saying that she does not have any concerns about the inquiry because the evidence concerning the Ukraine scandal is so \u201cdramatic and irrefutable\u201d. Influential congressmen Eliot Engel, Adam Schiff and Elijah Cummings, chairmen, respectively, of the House foreign affairs, intelligence and oversight committees, have warned secretary of state Mike Pompeo not to impede former and current officials from testifying in Washington. The guys in the spotlight You don\u2019t say? Amazing Here\u2019s what\u2019s already emerged today Opinion polls show public support for the Trump-Ukraine impeachment inquiry is rising steadily (including among Republicans, though from a low base in that camp, obviously). The office of the US intelligence community watchdog, Michael Atkinson, put out a statement pointing out that the whistleblower at the heart of the matter that precipitated the official impeachment process announced last week had \u201cdirect knowledge\u201d of the alleged misconduct by Donald Trump. That statement stands in pointed contrast to Trump\u2019s attacks accusing the whistleblower of relying on \u201chearsay\u201d. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo despatched a stern letter to the House foreign affairs committee Democratic chairman vowing to help current and former officials resist pressure (aka, per Pompeo, bullying) to testify to Congress about the Trump-Ukraine scandal. Cory Booker released encouraging fundraising info and his campaign declared the fight was still on, on the day some had expected he might have to quit the 2020 race for the Democratic nomination and the White House. Good news for New Jersey Senator and 2020 Democratic candidate Cory Booker: his campaign \u201ceclipsed\u201d an oddly specific goal of raising $1.7m before the end of the fundraising quarter that it said was necessary to keep the New Jersey senator in the 2020 Democratic presidential contest, my politics reporter colleague Lauren Gambino writes from Washington. \u201cIt was not an end-of-quarter stunt,\u201d campaign manager Addisu Demissie said on a celebratory campaign call with reporters. \u201cIt was our reality.\u201d The 10-day fundraising push raised more than $2m, which the campaign says is a strong sign voters want Booker in the race. Without the fundraising surge, Demissie said: \u201cWe would have had enough money to survive but not to grow.\u201d While the campaign is still counting checks and tallying totals, Demissie said it has raised more than $6m this quarter. That figure is far behind what his rivals Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg have reported for the three-month period. But for the Booker campaign, $6m was their best fundraising quarter yet. Booker has struggled to break through in a contest that is increasingly dominated by three candidates: Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Sanders. Yet his campaign argued that their fundraising success proved there was a hunger for another candidate to emerge and that the state of the race remains \u201cwide open\u201d. They point to polling that says only a small percentage of voters are firmly committed to a candidate with five months left before voting for the Democratic party nomination begins in Iowa early next year. Booker\u2019s campaign is now in a position to hire 40 more staff at their Newark headquarters and around the country with enough resources to invest in expanding his email list and building an effort to ensure he is on the ballot in all 50 states. They have set a new goal to raise $3m by the end of the month \u2013 but it is not \u201cmake-or-break\u201d, they say. If the campaign falls short, the campaign believes Booker is in a position to stay the course. Just this past weekend, things were looking a lot more bleak, my Guardian US colleague Martin Pengelly reported, with talk that Booker could have quit the race as early as today. Pompeo says he won\u2019t tolerate \u201ctactics\u201d of Dems in Congress seeking testimony from officials US secretary of state Mike Pompeo continued his broadside against congressional committee chairman Eliot Engel, in his letter today. Pompeo said that requested dates for officials voluntarily to appear on Capitol Hill for depositions related to the Trump-Ukraine impeachment inquiry were \u201cnot feasible.\u201d \u201cI am concerned with aspects of your request,\u201d Pompeo wrote to Engel, the Democratic congressmen from New York and chairman of the House foreign affairs committee. \u201cI will not tolerate such tactics, and I will use all means at my disposal to prevent and expose any attempts to intimidate the dedicated professionals,\u201d Pompeo wrote, as reported by the AP. The chairmen of three House committees, including Engel, made it clear last week that stonewalling their investigation would be considered obstruction of Congress in its investigation. The panels are seeking documents from the state department and voluntary testimony several current and former officials, this week and next, and had issued a subpoena. \u201cYour failure or refusal to comply with the subpoena shall constitute evidence of obstruction of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry,\u201d wrote Engel and the other chairmen, Adam Schiff of the Intelligence Committee, and Elijah Cummings of the Oversight Committee. The chairmen in their letter were seeking testimony from the former ambassador to Ukraine, Marie \u201cMasha\u201d Yovanovitch, and former special envoy Kurt Volker, who stepped down last week. Volker played a direct role in arranging meetings between Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, and Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the chairmen said, as part of what is seen as a backchannel in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv. The Democrats also want to hear from T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, a counselor at the state department, who also listened in on the crucial Trump-Zelenskiy call, they said. House Democrats launched the impeachment inquiry of Trump after a whistleblower\u2019s disclosure of the president\u2019s phone call with new Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in which Trump sought help in investigating 2020 election Democratic rival Joe Biden and Biden\u2019s son Hunter. In halting any appearances by state department officials - and demanding that executive branch lawyers accompany them - Pompeo is underscoring the administration\u2019s expansive view of the White House\u2019s authority and setting the tone for conflicts to come. It\u2019s unclear whether Pompeo will comply with the committees\u2019 request for documents by this Friday. He had declined to comply with their previous requests for information. Pompeo, traveling in Italy to meet with the country\u2019s president and prime minister, ignored shouted question about the impeachment inquiry from reporters earlier today in Rome. All this bearing in mind that Pompeo reportedly listened in to the Trump-Zelenskiy phone call in July, that is at the heart of the whistleblower complaint that precipitated last week\u2019s announcement by Nancy Pelosi of a congressional impeachment inquiry, but was evasive during subsequent media questions about the whistleblower complaint. Mueller - out of the spotlight, if not the headlines Talking of special counsel Robert Mueller - the man has returned to Big Law. Mueller has rejoined the law firm where he worked before leading the Trump-Russia investigation, on which he toiled from spring 2017 until spring 2019. The Washington law firm of WilmerHale announced today that Mueller would focus on crisis management and high-profile investigations, the Associated Press reports. Two other members of the special counsel\u2019s large legal team, Aaron Zebley and James Quarles, are also rejoining WilmerHale. Mueller finished his investigation earlier this year into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia to sway the 2016 presidential election. As a handy reminder, the key takeaways were: Mueller concluded there was no criminal conspiracy (although he found that the Trump election campaign was \u201creceptive\u201d to offers of assistance from the Russians). And Mueller found at least 10 episodes in which Trump\u2019s own actions may have amounted to obstruction of justice, detailing several instances in which the president\u2019s demands to interfere with the investigation were blocked by his aides, memorably noting that \u201cwhile this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him\u201d. Mueller has acknowledged what he saw as DoJ protocol that a sitting president cannot be indicted. He testified in July before two House committees. Hard on the heels of those events, which upped Trump\u2019s inaccurate boasting that he had been exonerated by Mueller, Trump hopped on the phone with Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine and started pressuring him to investigate Joe Biden. That led directly to the whistleblower complaint that almost immediately dunked the president into the boiling waters of an impeachment inquiry. The whistleblower who reported concerns over Donald Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy should be heard out and their identity protected,\u201d Republican US Senator Chuck Grassley said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cThis person appears to have followed the whistleblower protection laws and ought to be heard out and protected,\u201d Grassley said, as reported by the Reuters news agency. \u201cWe should always work to respect whistleblowers\u2019 requests for confidentiality. No one should be making judgments or pronouncements without hearing from the whistleblower first and carefully following up on the facts.\u201d In a normal world, this statement might be interpreted as simply one of common, bipartisan decency. But given the hysterical, intimidating abuse flung in the whistleblower\u2019s direction by Donald Trump from his seat of high power in these hyper-partisan days, it is not insignificant. Grassley, the gruff Iowa Republican is the powerful chairman of the Senate finance committee and president pro tempore of the Senate, making him third in the line of succession for the White House - should anything happen to the president that eliminates him from office - after vice president Mike Pence and speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. His 86th birthday present last month was hernia surgery. And on Monday Senate homeland security committee chairman Ron Johnson and Grassley, as chair of the finance panel, asked US attorney general William Barr to investigate \u201cany ties\u201d between Ukraine and Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign, as Republican lawmakers and other instruments of the Trump administration frantically seek to counter the scandal of Russian interference in the 2016 campaign in its attempt to assist Trump, as found by special counsel Robert Mueller. The letter said they have \u201cconcerns about foreign assistance in the 2016 election that have not been thoroughly addressed,\u201d Politico reported. Notwithstanding, Grassley thinks this whistleblower must be listened to. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo has written to the House foreign affairs committee chairman, New York Democrat Eliot Engel, vowing to prevent attempts to \u201cintimidate, bully, and treat improperly\u201d current and former members of the state department into testifying in relation to the impeachment inquiry In the letter, Pompeo said he would work to expose what he called any attempts to intimidate employees, the Wall Street Journal reports. This comes as the committee sets about asking Trump administration officials past and present to appear on Capitol Hill to explain and answer questions about their knowledge of the Trump-Ukraine scandal, which prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to announce just a week ago now (one day after Greta Thunberg gave a blistering address to the United Nations climate summit in New York - was that a lifetime ago?) Pompeo said he is \u201cconcerned with aspects of the Committee\u2019s request that can be understood only as an attempt to intimidate, bully, &amp; treat improperly the distinguished professionals of the Department of State, including several career [foreign-service officers].\u201d Pompeo was in Rome as part of a visit to Italy and Greece. Those still \u201cfeeling the Bern\u201d open their wallets Bernie Sanders has raised over $25m in the last three months, according to his campaign, my Washington colleague Lauren Gambino writes. This is a massive haul for the senator and 2020 Democratic candidate for the White House. It\u2019s $7m more than he raised last quarter \u2013 and comes as his campaign contends with headlines such as Politico\u2019s: Bernie Sanders is in trouble. Elizabeth Warren has overtaken Sanders in several polls as the top-polling alternative to Joe Biden. But his fundraising numbers show what has always been the heart of his campaign: a fiercely loyal base of grassroots donors. Last week Sanders team announced that he had received contributions from more than 1 million people. \u201cBernie is proud to be the only candidate running to defeat Donald Trump who is 100% funded by grassroots donations \u2013 both in the primary and in the general,\u201d Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in a statement this morning. \u201cMedia elites and professional pundits have tried repeatedly to dismiss this campaign, and yet working-class Americans keep saying loudly and clearly that they want a political revolution.\u201d A point of pride for the Sanders\u2019 campaign, \u201cteacher\u201d was the most common occupation of a contributor while the most common employer was Starbucks, Amazon and Walmart \u2013 a sign his message is resonating with workers. His campaign said the average donation was $18.07. Pete Buttigieg, who is running a long-shot campaign to go from small-city Indiana mayor to president, raised $19.1m during the third quarter, according to his campaign. This is slightly down from last quarter, when he raked in a stunning $24.8m, but the figures he released today show the mayor has the resources to stay in the contest for the foreseeable future. Sanders and Buttigieg are among the only candidates to reveal their fundraising figures at this stage. More campaigns are likely to announce their figures, but the full picture won\u2019t come into view until 15 October, the deadline by which candidates must submit their third-quarter fundraising totals. Pompeo pushes back against Democrat pressure on officials to testify in Trump/Ukraine impeachment inquiry Hot off the online press, folks (meaning more details to follow), is this flash report that secretary of state Mike Pompeo is resolved to help state department officials resist pressure to testify as part of the congressional impeachment inquiry: \u201cPompeo vows to block efforts to \u2018bully\u2019 State Department officials to testify regarding Ukraine controversy,\u201d blared the Wall Street Journal moments ago. The outlet continues: \u201cPompeo comments come as House panels set to depose former and current State Department officials.\u201d Watch this space.... Intelligence community watchdog contradicts Trump assertions about whistleblower knowledge of \u201calleged conduct\u201d The office of the inspector general of the US intelligence community put out a statement last night, as we just flagged, in which he explained some further, key details about the characteristics of the whistleblower complaint he, Michael Atkinson, received on August 12. The complaint was deemed by the inspector general to be credible and of urgent concern, detailing as it did a phone call between Donald Trump and the Ukrainian president in July in which the US president suggested Ukraine investigate his political rival, Joe Biden. Trump has been trying to undercut the complainant - the whistleblower- by shouting loudly on Twitter about he or she relying on having received details about the phone call (which Trump repeatedly asserts, anyway, was a \u201cperfect\u201d call) second or third hand. The new statement from Atkinson\u2019s office reads: \u201cThe Complainant on the form he or she submitted on August 12, 2019 in fact checked two relevant boxes: The first box stated that, \u201cI have personal and/or direct knowledge of events or records involved\u201d; and the second box stated that, \u201cOther employees have told me about events or records involved.\u201d As part of his determination that the urgent concern appeared credible, the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community determined that the Complainant had official and authorized access to the information and sources referenced in the Complainant\u2019s Letter and Classified Appendix, including direct knowledge of certain alleged conduct, and that the Complainant has subject matter expertise related to much of the material information provided in the Complainant\u2019s Letter and Classified Appendix. In short, the ICIG did not find that the Complainant could \u201cprovide nothing more than second-hand or unsubstantiated assertions,\u201d which would have made it much harder, and significantly less likely, for the Inspector General to determine in a 14-calendar day review period that the complaint \u201cappeared credible,\u201d as required by statute. You can read the full statement from the office of the inspector general here. US intelligence community inspector general, Michael Atkinson, has released a statement pointing out that the whistleblower in the Trump/Ukraine scandal had \u201cdirect knowledge\u201d of the alleged conduct that was the subject of the urgent complaint he or she filed in mid-August. The complaint related to a phone call between Donald Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy in July, in which the president appeared to pressure his counterpart to investigate Joe Biden, a leading Trump rival for the presidency in the 2020 election, and the business activities in Ukraine of the Democrat\u2019s younger son, Hunter Biden. Atkinson \u201cdetermined that the Complainant had...direct knowledge of certain alleged conduct\u201d, he said in a statement last night. This contrasts with Trump\u2019s repeated trashing of the anonymous whistleblower as a person whose complaint was based on second and third hand knowledge of the phone call. Trump is tweeting Here\u2019s the president\u2019s big picture message this morning. The problem with this map is that it shows voting support by geography, not population, so some of these areas had, like, one human voter and a bunch of bison. Here\u2019s more, very helpfully, on this from the Washington Post in 2018. Other tweets from the President of the United States this morning continue down his line of argument that the Ukraine scandal and impeachment inquiry are a Democratic party and mainstream media \u201choax\u201d. I refer you back to the whistleblower complaint in full and the full memo of the phone call Trump had with the Ukrainian president in July, which speak for themselves without any filtration/amplification on Capitol Hill or by the media. Public support for impeachment rising - but still below 50% The number of Americans who believe Donald Trump should be impeached rose by eight percentage points over the past week as more people learned about allegations that Trump pressured Ukraine to smear his top Democratic political rival Joe Biden, according to a new Reuters/Ipsos poll. The September 26-30 opinion poll found that 45% of adults believe Trump \u201cshould be impeached,\u201d compared with 37% in a similar poll that ran last week, Reuters writes. So impeachment is clearly not (yet?) supported by a majority of the public, but it is the predominant view, as 41% said that Trump should not be impeached and 15% said they \u201cdon\u2019t know.\u201d The Reuters/Ipsos poll followed a swath of other results that showed similar trends. Yesterday, one poll, conducted by Quinnipiac University over the weekend, found a 20-point swing in the last five days in support for Trump\u2019s impeachment. Americans are now split 47-47 on the question of impeachment, the poll found, compared with 37% for impeachment and 57% opposition measured by the poll on 25 September. Another poll, conducted by CNN/SSRS, also found that 47% of Americans support impeaching Trump, up 6 points from when the question was asked in May. The odds of Trump\u2019s impeachment hit a new high of 71% in online betting markets, meanwhile, my colleague Tom McCarthy wrote last night. It\u2019s hardly a surprise that there is a huge partisan element to public support or opposition. Reuters further reports from its latest poll that, among Democrats, 74% said Trump, a Republican president, should be impeached. That\u2019s up 8 points over the past week, while only 13% of Republicans said they supported impeachment, but that had risen by three points. The level was unchanged among independents at 37%. Full Reuters/Ipsos poll results: tmsnrt.rs/2n3AYWx Glance-back: the American public has been increasingly focused on the question of impeachment following a whistleblower complaint about a July phone call between Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. These latest polls were taken before last night\u2019s reports that drew secretary of state Mike Pompeo and attorney general Bill Barr further into the scandal. Good morning, US politics watchers: here we go with another day of tumult. What a week, and it\u2019s only Tuesday. Here\u2019s what\u2019s coming up today: Public support for impeaching the president is gradually building, as senior figures in his administration get drawn into the Donald Trump-Ukraine scandal. There\u2019s new polling data out \u2013 and Trump has some fresh pushback. Third quarter fundraising figures are expected for the 2020 Democratic candidates, as most, but not all, advance to the next debate, in Ohio mid-month. Who\u2019s up, who\u2019s down \u2013 and who might be out very soon? Republican congressman Chris Collins is expected to plead guilty in a New York court this morning to insider trader charges. He resigned yesterday, just another statistic in a GOP exodus from Capitol Hill. There will be a lot more action. Stay tuned.",
