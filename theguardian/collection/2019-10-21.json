      "bodyText": "Northern Ireland is to legalise abortion and same-sex marriage after an 11th-hour attempt by the region\u2019s assembly to block change collapsed into farce. Equality campaigners celebrated on Monday as the clock ticked towards midnight when laws extending abortion and marriage rights came into force, ushering in momentous social change as Northern Ireland aligned with the rest of the UK. Anti-abortion groups led by the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) tried to avert liberalisation by recalling the mothballed chamber at Stormont for the first time in almost three years. But discord and walkouts stymied debate and left the assembly deserted. \u201cThe beginning of a new era for Northern Ireland \u2013 one in which we\u2019re free from oppressive laws that have policed our bodies and healthcare,\u201d said Grainne Teggart, Amnesty International\u2019s Northern Ireland campaign manager. \u201cThank you to everyone who has told their stories to help us reach this milestone,\u201d tweeted Love Equality NI, an umbrella group that campaigned for marriage equality. \u201cA historic moment,\u201d said the advocacy group Stonewall. The new legislation puts the House of Commons on track to legislate for marriage equality by January 2020, paving the way for same-sex couples to wed from 14 February \u2013 Valentine\u2019s Day. The abortion law obliges the UK to ensure regulations for free, legal and local abortion services are in place by 31 March 2020. After midnight there will be a moratorium on criminal prosecutions, halting police investigations into abortion cases, including a case against a mother who faced jail for buying her then 15-year-old daughter abortion pills online, said Amnesty. \u201cIn 2014 when I needed an abortion and was denied one I swore I would add my voice to the campaign for abortion rights and to have achieved that is just incredible,\u201d said Ashleigh Topley, who was part of a supreme court challenge to the ban. The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, in contrast, lamented a \u201cshameful\u201d day and said her party would examine ways to repeal the legislation. \u201cWe will do everything in our conscience to protect the lives of the unborn,\u201d she said. Northern Ireland had retained a Victorian-era ban on same sex marriage and a near-blanket ban on abortion due to the power of the DUP and other religious and social conservatives. The Conservative government, reliant on DUP votes in Westminster, declined to intervene, saying both issues were for devolved government. However a dispute between the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in toppled the power-sharing assembly and executive at Stormont in January 2017, leaving a vacuum. Campaigners broke the stalemate in July when two Labour MPs, Stella Creasy and Conor McGinn, tabled amendments on abortion and same-sex marriage to an otherwise technical government bill connected to the defunct assembly. MPs voted overwhelmingly for both. Monday was the last chance for opponents of change to restore Stormont and avert the legislation. Some 31 members of the legislative assembly (MLAs) signed a petition to force a recall to discuss a motion to put abortion rights back in the hands of local politicians. Sinn F\u00e9in and the Alliance party said they would not attend, calling the event a stunt, leaving Monday\u2019s gathering largely symbolic and devoid of the power to elect a new speaker and form an executive. The recall degenerated into debacle when MLAs clashed with each other and the outgoing speaker, Robin Newton, over procedure. Newton said electing a new speaker required cross-party support. The only nationalist party present, the SDLP, withheld support. One by one members of the DUP, the Ulster Unionists (UUP), SDLP and other parties walked out. By the time the Speaker called a vote on adjournment the chamber was empty. Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s deputy leader, Michelle O\u2019Neill, said the attempted recall further battered public confidence in the defunct assembly. The UUP leader, Robin Swann, questioned whether Stormont institutions were worth saving.",

And, in the first gallery, a 2005 reconstruction of a 1963 aluminium enclosure, a sort of spiralling cell where we find ourselves enfolded in a black and white, optically arresting work painted on its curved walls. I thought, suddenly, of those brainwashing cells beloved of 1960s spy thrillers.</p> <p>There always seems to be a Bridget Riley show on somewhere in the world. She is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/feb/27/henry-moore-sculpture-tate-britain\">as ubiquitous to British art as Henry Moore</a>, though with better reason. Moore invented very little. Like many artists, after developing his own style, and with a few more or less interesting detours, he went into production, making Henry Moores rather than sculpture. After which, there is little to be said, and too much to look at. Moore\u2019s art is redolent of its period. Somehow, even in the op-art, swinging 60s works that first made her name, Riley\u2019s art is almost always in the present. In fact, its presentness, and the way her work bursts and shimmers, rolls and flickers and writhes before us, winking at us, humming with its painted intervals and visual beats, going in and out of phase, dopplering and creating grand visual chords, prises the paintings out of their time. They are always in the here and now.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"91098a421305d4b74bf2625a1223ab5e7e83f4a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91098a421305d4b74bf2625a1223ab5e7e83f4a4/0_1172_5315_3188/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Detail from Pause, 1964.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Detail from Pause, 1964.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bridget Riley 2019.

Always interesting, and often astonishing, I do feel that the Hayward show is a bit too big. I\u2019d have preferred fewer works, a less dutiful hang. The lighting is a bit too warm for my liking. Her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2003/jun/24/artsfeatures.tatebritain\">retrospective in the top-lit exhibition spaces of Tate Britain in 2003</a> had a kind of clarity the Hayward lacks. Riley\u2019s work likes daylight.</p> <p>Colour and its intensity and tonality (degrees of light and dark) is relational, and comparative, and depends both on context and on the physics of light, and on the ways in which eye and brain perceive visual phenomena. How we see things, and what we see, has psychological as well as physiological and neurological dimensions. We could talk about <a href=\"https://www.colorduels.com/what-is-simultaneous-contrast/\">simultaneous contrast </a>and the<a href=\"https://www.schemecolor.com/grayscale.php\"> grey scale</a>, <a href=\"https://www.techopedia.com/definition/1968/color-saturation\">colour saturation</a> and the way the cones and rods in the eye tire and begin to deceive us, but somehow her paintings go beyond the technical and the phenomenological.

Memory and mood, youthfulness and age all play their part. Just as the ageing ear can no longer here the sounds made by bats, so the eye deteriorates. Never forget that we are bodies in time and space, our own time as much as the stilled time in the art we\u2019re looking at. The conditions of our encounters matter too. Whether we can sit or linger, whether an artwork is bigger or smaller than us, whether we can take it in all at once, or whether what we are encountering demands successive and individually incomplete, repeated looks. What happens when someone walks between us and a Riley painting, or one of those enormous wall drawings? Look how they\u2019re framed, watch how they are engulfed.</p> <p>Riley makes us aware of all this. Her paintings are not eye tests, or colour charts, or perceptual games and conundrums. They\u2019re paintings, although without any surface texture or inflection; no brush marks, no wandering lines, no fuzzy edges, no blips in the nub of the canvas. Even her curves, where she uses them, are true. Invariably, she signs the paintings down the side of the canvas, out of harm\u2019s way. This small but evident human touch always provides me with a sign of release. It is like an exhalation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30eb9d40072a741dc65d83e07f34f74fd878d48d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30eb9d40072a741dc65d83e07f34f74fd878d48d/1987_186_3961_2379/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Detail from Cascando, 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Detail from Cascando, 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bridget Riley 2019.

      "bodyText": "Bridget Riley\u2019s art is as sneaky as it is spectacular. Some of her paintings make you want to fall over and some make you feel like you\u2019re fainting, your eyes ping-ponging all over the place. Others are more stately in their visual rhythms, but the experience of a Riley is never static. The eye roams and the brain roams with it. You think you get it, and then you don\u2019t. All this with a few repeated intervals of black and white, some circles or stripes or blocks of colour. Riley\u2019s paintings and wall drawings are great to look at. They are also deadly serious. This is the third major exhibition of Riley\u2019s work to be held at the Hayward, and the largest retrospective of her work to date. Travelling to from the National Galleries of Scotland, and spanning the artist\u2019s entire career, from drawings she made as a schoolgirl in the 1940s, to works completed this year, the exhibition is full of surprises as well as familiar works. Among the studies for paintings and early works \u2013 including her analytical transcriptions of Georges Seurat, painted to understand how pointillism worked \u2013 we find youthful life studies and, much later, portrait drawings of friends made in the 1980s. And, in the first gallery, a 2005 reconstruction of a 1963 aluminium enclosure, a sort of spiralling cell where we find ourselves enfolded in a black and white, optically arresting work painted on its curved walls. I thought, suddenly, of those brainwashing cells beloved of 1960s spy thrillers. There always seems to be a Bridget Riley show on somewhere in the world. She is as ubiquitous to British art as Henry Moore, though with better reason. Moore invented very little. Like many artists, after developing his own style, and with a few more or less interesting detours, he went into production, making Henry Moores rather than sculpture. After which, there is little to be said, and too much to look at. Moore\u2019s art is redolent of its period. Somehow, even in the op-art, swinging 60s works that first made her name, Riley\u2019s art is almost always in the present. In fact, its presentness, and the way her work bursts and shimmers, rolls and flickers and writhes before us, winking at us, humming with its painted intervals and visual beats, going in and out of phase, dopplering and creating grand visual chords, prises the paintings out of their time. They are always in the here and now. At 88, Riley remains full of curiosity, and is still enlarging and deepening her territory, simplifying and re-complicating her art as she goes. Always interesting, and often astonishing, I do feel that the Hayward show is a bit too big. I\u2019d have preferred fewer works, a less dutiful hang. The lighting is a bit too warm for my liking. Her retrospective in the top-lit exhibition spaces of Tate Britain in 2003 had a kind of clarity the Hayward lacks. Riley\u2019s work likes daylight. Colour and its intensity and tonality (degrees of light and dark) is relational, and comparative, and depends both on context and on the physics of light, and on the ways in which eye and brain perceive visual phenomena. How we see things, and what we see, has psychological as well as physiological and neurological dimensions. We could talk about simultaneous contrast and the grey scale, colour saturation and the way the cones and rods in the eye tire and begin to deceive us, but somehow her paintings go beyond the technical and the phenomenological. There\u2019s magic there. It\u2019s all relative, and subjective, a matter of the mind as well as the body. Memory and mood, youthfulness and age all play their part. Just as the ageing ear can no longer here the sounds made by bats, so the eye deteriorates. Never forget that we are bodies in time and space, our own time as much as the stilled time in the art we\u2019re looking at. The conditions of our encounters matter too. Whether we can sit or linger, whether an artwork is bigger or smaller than us, whether we can take it in all at once, or whether what we are encountering demands successive and individually incomplete, repeated looks. What happens when someone walks between us and a Riley painting, or one of those enormous wall drawings? Look how they\u2019re framed, watch how they are engulfed. Riley makes us aware of all this. Her paintings are not eye tests, or colour charts, or perceptual games and conundrums. They\u2019re paintings, although without any surface texture or inflection; no brush marks, no wandering lines, no fuzzy edges, no blips in the nub of the canvas. Even her curves, where she uses them, are true. Invariably, she signs the paintings down the side of the canvas, out of harm\u2019s way. This small but evident human touch always provides me with a sign of release. It is like an exhalation. Most of her paintings and her large-scale wall drawings have been completed by assistants, following Riley\u2019s own working drawings, her precise colour swatches and instructions. Her application is already complete. Her work is all in a literal sense flat and exact. But there is nothing flat or mechanical in Riley\u2019s art, which is full of life and movement and energy, slowness as well as instantaneousness. These works give their pleasures generously. Riley\u2019s wall drawings of abutted and overlapping open circles are utterly fixating; I watch them doing their endless thing. I\u2019m baffled by the diagonal rhomboid paintings and have never got with the compound curve paintings. Rajasthan, a 2012 red, orange and green wall painting, disappoints me. But her most recent works, with their muted coloured circles, show what spot paintings can do. They look back to John Constable\u2019s cloud studies, even as they seem to look out at us. Some works creep up on you. Others demand that you move up close then step away, or watch rather than look at them, and let them take you over. There is some art that only needs to be seen once, or not at all. Riley\u2019s depends on multiple appraisals, on looking and looking away, on departures and returns, on refocusing and re-encountering. As Michael Corleone says in The Godfather Part 3, \u201cJust when I thought I was out, they pull me back in.\u201d Bridget Riley is at the Hayward Gallery, London, from 23 October to 26 January",

      "bodyText": "Tougher punishments for those convicted of expressing support for banned organisations or viewing terrorist material online are being proposed by the Sentencing Council. Following changes to legislation brought in by the Counter-Terrorism and Border Security Act 2019, the official body, which publishes guidelines for judges, has circulated a fresh consultation on raising sentences for the most serious offences. The act increased maximum prison sentences for a range of terrorism offences. Consequently the Sentencing Council is recommending raising \u201csentence levels for the most serious examples of offending, where there was no headroom [previously] \u2026 due to the statutory maximum\u201d. The council has in the past supported more punitive prison terms for terrorism in an era when \u201ca terrorist act can be planned in a very short time, using readily available items as weapons, combined with online extremist material on websites which normalise terrorist activity\u201d. The latest changes draw a distinction between an offender in a position of authority or influence who directly invites support for a proscribed organisation and one who expresses supportive views while being reckless as to whether others are encouraged to get involved. For those who intentionally express support for a proscribed organisation while holding a position of trust the starting point for judges imposing a prison sentence should be seven years, the new guidelines recommend. The culpability factors for those found guilty of collecting terrorist information have been amended to include offences committed by viewing or streaming terrorist information over the internet. For an offender who collects, makes a record of, possesses or views material that provides instruction for specific terrorist activity endangering life where harm is very likely to be caused, the judges\u2019 starting point for sentencing those found guilty should be 10 years in custody, the guidelines propose. Mr Justice Julian Goose, a member of the Sentencing Council, said: \u201cTerrorism offences are extremely serious and can cover a wide range of factual circumstances, making them difficult and sensitive offences to sentence. For this reason, the council is keen to ensure that the guidelines are kept up to date and fit for purpose \u201cThese revised guidelines will ensure consistency and transparency in the sentencing of these offences.\u201d The consultation runs from 22 October to 3 December.

With prize money down to sixth place, a clean sweep for O\u2019Brien\u2019s runners would be worth \u00a3200,000 and give him a realistic hope of taking the title.</p> \n<p>With no certainty over the eventual make-up of O\u2019Brien\u2019s challenge, several bookmakers declined to price up the race on Monday. William Hill, though, installed Mogul, a full brother to this year\u2019s International Stakes winner, Japan, as the hot favourite at 4-7, with Innisfree next at 4-1. Kameko is a 6-1 shot to keep the Ballydoyle posse at bay, ahead of Armory and Royal Dornoch on 8-1 and 10-1 respectively.</p> \n<p>Hill also reopened betting on the trainers\u2019 title, with Gosden priced up at 4-7 and O\u2019Brien offered at 5-4.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a horse race,\u201d David Redvers, the racing manager to Qatar Racing, which owns Kameko, said. \u201cYou have to take them on and it doesn\u2019t matter who trains them. At the end of the day, it\u2019s a bunch of horses running in a field.\u201d</p> \n<p>Roderick Duncan, the Doncaster clerk of the course, was baffled by the failure of so many of Britain\u2019s top yards to offer any resistance to Ballydoyle.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had no significant rain for six days, less than half a millimetre most of those days, so [the ground] has dried back a little bit,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m looking to see if the other horses [which were entered but not declared] ran recently or have other options, but it doesn\u2019t appear they have. I\u2019m lost for an explanation. Respect to Aidan. We\u2019re always grateful for his support and on this occasion we\u2019d be lost without them.\u201d</p> \n<p>Sam Cone, the spokesman for Arena Racing Company, which owns Doncaster, said it will study the entry process for the race following Saturday\u2019s renewal. \u201cWe appreciate that the 2019 renewal offers a fairly unique situation,\u201d he said, \u201cbut are hopeful it will once again offer the chance to uncover another star two-year-old to look out for in next year\u2019s Classics.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe team at Doncaster are focused on delivering two great days racing on Friday and Saturday but we will certainly consider the entry processes for the race in the wash-up from this year\u2019s meeting.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Tuesday\u2019s best bets</h2> \n<p>Flat racing on turf does not give way to jumping and the all-weather until 9 November but this is the week when you can really sense the imminent baton-switching and there are some interesting races under both codes on the schedule this afternoon.</p> \n<p>At Newcastle, the first win-and-you\u2019re-in qualifier for All-Weather Finals day next Easter gives a small but talented field of juveniles a chance to book a slot at Lingfield on 10 April. Mark Johnston\u2019s <strong>Desert Safari (3.45)</strong>, who has improved with every run so far and was within four lengths of the winner in the Two-Year-Old Trophy at Redcar last time, looks like a safe bet here, while <strong>John Kirkup (4.50)</strong> and <strong>Mr Greenlight (5.20)</strong> should also go well later on the card.</p> \n<p>Exeter, meanwhile, offers some competitive racing over jumps and a chance for <strong>Southfield Stone (4.10)</strong> to make his first start over fences in a beginners\u2019 event that has been won by some very useful chasers over the years. Paul Nicholls\u2019s gelding was a Grade Two winner as a novice hurdler last season and though he trailed home in last in a Grade One at the Grand National meeting, he looks like the sort to find further improvement over fences.</p> \n<p><strong>Reikers Island (3.35)</strong> is another to consider on the same card along with <strong>First Figaro (4.40)</strong>, while <strong>Total Commitment (7.30)</strong> and <strong>Lord Halifax (3.25)</strong> look best on the Flat cards at Kempton Park and Yarmouth respectively.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ed5d7c56-7a61-42c6-9696-a8495f074758\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Yarmouth<br></b><b>1.40 </b>Little Brown Trout <b>2.15&nbsp;</b>Vintage Polly <b>2.50 </b>Too Big To Fail <b>3.25&nbsp;</b>Lord&nbsp;Halifax (nb) <b>4.00 </b>Bruyere <b>4.30&nbsp;</b>Sarasota Bay <b>5.00 </b>Dutch Story</p>\n    <p><b>Exeter<br></b><b>1.50 </b>Chance It <b>2.25 </b>Hang In There <b>3.00 </b>Jubilympics <b>3.35 </b>Reikers Island <b>4.10 </b>Southfield Stone&nbsp;<b>4.40 </b>First Figaro <b>5.10 </b>The Rebel Outlaw</p>\n    <p><b>Newcastle<br></b><b>2.00 </b>Yvette <b>2.35 </b>Grand Bazaar <b>3.10 </b>Paddy Power <b>3.45 </b>Desert Safari <b>4.20 </b>Scheme <b>4.50 </b>John Kirkup <b>5.20 </b>Mr Greenlight</p>\n    <p><b>Kempton Park<br></b><b>4.55 </b>Never Said Nothing <b>5.30&nbsp;</b>Mabo <b>6.00 </b>Pike Corner Cross <b>6.30 </b>Raaeb <b>7.00 </b>Desert Fox <b>7.30 </b>Total Commitment (nap) <b>8.00 </b>Singing Sheriff <b>8.30 </b>Miss Blondell</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

The trainer has an added incentive to win the race this year as he is just over \u00a3100,000 behind John Gosden in the race for the trainers\u2019 championship, having made significant inroads into what had appeared to be an insurmountable lead for Gosden with two winners on Champions Day at Ascot last Saturday. With prize money down to sixth place, a clean sweep for O\u2019Brien\u2019s runners would be worth \u00a3200,000 and give him a realistic hope of taking the title. With no certainty over the eventual make-up of O\u2019Brien\u2019s challenge, several bookmakers declined to price up the race on Monday. William Hill, though, installed Mogul, a full brother to this year\u2019s International Stakes winner, Japan, as the hot favourite at 4-7, with Innisfree next at 4-1. Kameko is a 6-1 shot to keep the Ballydoyle posse at bay, ahead of Armory and Royal Dornoch on 8-1 and 10-1 respectively. Hill also reopened betting on the trainers\u2019 title, with Gosden priced up at 4-7 and O\u2019Brien offered at 5-4. \u201cIt\u2019s a horse race,\u201d David Redvers, the racing manager to Qatar Racing, which owns Kameko, said. \u201cYou have to take them on and it doesn\u2019t matter who trains them. At the end of the day, it\u2019s a bunch of horses running in a field.\u201d Roderick Duncan, the Doncaster clerk of the course, was baffled by the failure of so many of Britain\u2019s top yards to offer any resistance to Ballydoyle. \u201cWe\u2019ve had no significant rain for six days, less than half a millimetre most of those days, so [the ground] has dried back a little bit,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m looking to see if the other horses [which were entered but not declared] ran recently or have other options, but it doesn\u2019t appear they have. I\u2019m lost for an explanation. Respect to Aidan. We\u2019re always grateful for his support and on this occasion we\u2019d be lost without them.\u201d Sam Cone, the spokesman for Arena Racing Company, which owns Doncaster, said it will study the entry process for the race following Saturday\u2019s renewal. \u201cWe appreciate that the 2019 renewal offers a fairly unique situation,\u201d he said, \u201cbut are hopeful it will once again offer the chance to uncover another star two-year-old to look out for in next year\u2019s Classics. \u201cThe team at Doncaster are focused on delivering two great days racing on Friday and Saturday but we will certainly consider the entry processes for the race in the wash-up from this year\u2019s meeting.\u201d Tuesday\u2019s best bets Flat racing on turf does not give way to jumping and the all-weather until 9 November but this is the week when you can really sense the imminent baton-switching and there are some interesting races under both codes on the schedule this afternoon. At Newcastle, the first win-and-you\u2019re-in qualifier for All-Weather Finals day next Easter gives a small but talented field of juveniles a chance to book a slot at Lingfield on 10 April. Mark Johnston\u2019s Desert Safari (3.45), who has improved with every run so far and was within four lengths of the winner in the Two-Year-Old Trophy at Redcar last time, looks like a safe bet here, while John Kirkup (4.50) and Mr Greenlight (5.20) should also go well later on the card. Exeter, meanwhile, offers some competitive racing over jumps and a chance for Southfield Stone (4.10) to make his first start over fences in a beginners\u2019 event that has been won by some very useful chasers over the years. Paul Nicholls\u2019s gelding was a Grade Two winner as a novice hurdler last season and though he trailed home in last in a Grade One at the Grand National meeting, he looks like the sort to find further improvement over fences. Reikers Island (3.35) is another to consider on the same card along with First Figaro (4.40), while Total Commitment (7.30) and Lord Halifax (3.25) look best on the Flat cards at Kempton Park and Yarmouth respectively.",

Less than half (44%) of councils in England have either cut or frozen funding for educational support for VI children, putting specialist provision under significant pressure, according to the RNIB report. A similar proportion (43%) have already had reductions in specialist staff and increasing workloads for those who remain, and almost a quarter (24%) are planning further reviews that could result in more cuts.

Here is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/publications/revised-withdrawal-agreement-including-protocol-ireland-and-northern-ireland_en\">link to the full text</a>.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>The backstop is replaced</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The backstop has essentially been replaced by a full stop whereby Northern Ireland remains aligned to the EU from the end of the transition period for at least four years. A change can only happen if it is voted on by the Stormont assembly.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Consent</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Stormont will have a key role in future Brexit arrangements. And if there is cross-community support to remain aligned to the EU rather than the UK the consent will hold for eight years.</p>\n    <p>The arrangements in this deal will automatically kick in for a mandated four years if there is a breakdown in trade talks, so it remains a \u201cbackstop\u201d but with a permanent tinge.</p>\n    <p>That four-year period will start at the end of December 2020.</p>\n    <p>Two months before the end of the four-year period, that is October 2024, Stormont will be asked to vote on whether to remain aligned to the EU in ways outlined by this deal or not.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Checks on border, ports and airports</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Under the deal, the UK and the EU are \u201cunderlining their firm commitment to no customs and regulatory checks or controls and related physical infrastructure at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland\u201d.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Future trade deals</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The EU and the UK will aim for a zero-tariff deal with unlimited quotas. The entire UK, including Northern Ireland, will be free to sign trade deals. The line in the political declaration that \u201cthe United Kingdom will consider aligning with union rules in relevant areas\u201d in any future trade talks has been ditched.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Customs</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Northern Ireland will remain legally in the UK customs territory but practically in the EU customs unions. There will therefore be no customs checks on the border but tariffs will be payable on certain commercial goods.</p>\n    <p>No customs duties will be payable on \u201cpersonal property\u201d being transited from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. That protects online shopping and all items bought for personal rather than commercial use.</p>\n    <p>Customs duties will be payable on goods imported from the UK for commercial use unless it can be demonstrated that the goods remain in Northern Ireland or are for personal use, as above.</p>\n    <p>A system of rebates will allow importers to be reimbursed.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>West/east trade</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The commitment to frictionless trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain is restated.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>VAT</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>EU law on VAT will apply in Northern Ireland.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Single electricity market</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The island of Ireland is considering a single market for electricity so homes in Northern Ireland can get their energy from a supplier in Northern Ireland or the republic. There were fears this could be disrupted by Brexit. Under the Johnson deal, the provisions of union law remain so nothing will change.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Level playing field</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This guarantees that the UK will remain in line with EU conventions on climate, environment and workers rights in a future trade agreement.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lisaocarroll\"><b>Lisa O'Carroll</b></a>&nbsp;<i>Brexit correspondent</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Rapid ratification</h2> \n<p>Normally international treaties \u2013 and this is such a treaty, under law \u2013 must be before parliament for at least 21 sitting days in order to be ratified.

We have enough firepower to Ferguson our way through the teams between 11th and 20th without fuss and our defence should be more reliable against top half teams. Unfortunately, Unai Emery thinks Mesut \u00d6zil\u2019s talent is not unique and that Granit Xhaka\u2019s is. Lucas Torreira was at heart of our improved performances in big games last season only to get benched regularly this term.

Do they convince you? Of course they don\u2019t, and they don\u2019t convince me either, but they\u2019ve picked up that winning knack largely because they have a matchwinner \u2013 Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang \u2013 who is better than almost anyone else in the league.

Arsenal seem eminently rattle-able and there\u2019s no doubt Chris Wilder\u2019s side play some delightfully intense, intelligent, insistent football whose style and quality still aren\u2019t appreciated quite as much as they should be.

The more they can take points from games like this, the less likely they are to face a relegation battle. I fancy they won\u2019t have to worry about that, when push comes to show.</p> <p><strong>So let\u2019s strap in and enjoy. </strong>Send in your emails, tweets and goodness knows what else \u2013 and we\u2019ll hold each other\u2019s hands through the madness.</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "Anyway, that\u2019ll do from me. Much to chew over there. The Blades can glory in an excellent win; Arsenal will wonder where on earth they go from here. Thanks for your company and we\u2019ll talk again soon! Christian Widerin doesn\u2019t mince his words: \u201cWhat Emery is doing to this club is a crime. I consider him probably the worst coach in the Premier league atm. Just completely fed up with him, also with his attitude towards Ozil. It\u2019s ridiculous. A defensive coward, he despises creativity and the beautiful game. Good riddance.\u201d Ben Park also writes: \u201c[Arsenal are] Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat I believe, would be an adequate analogy for this Arsenal team. It is (insert your preferred football style), and at the same time is not.\u201d Here is the match report from your correspondent on the scene, Paul Doyle: Chris Wilder, such an outstanding coach, speaks: \u201cWe were under pressure in the second half but we limited their chances. Three points was a great reward for the players. It\u2019s crazy if people think we can just open up against Arsenal. You saw in the first half some of their players skipping round our like they weren\u2019t even there, so we had to find a balance. We defended manfully. \u201cIf people watched us last year, we try to play our own way. We wanted to speak to our identity this year. We had to tinker in certain parts, we knew we could\u2019t play two in midfield this year. We try to win a game of football by whatever means and we\u2019ve got some talented boys who\u2019ve been on the journey from League One. It\u2019s a fantastic result and a great reward for everybody.\u201d Some fine performances from Sheffield United players there. Fleck and Baldock were the standouts for me but there was no weak link. They look so well drilled, so physically and mentally on point, but play some fast, exciting, aggressive football too. Can any of that be said for their opponents? An Arsenal take, referring to the fact that results had been papering over some quite obvious problems. On a night when Aubameyang can\u2019t step in and rustle something up, it makes for a big problem. A famous, deserved win for the Blades! And on the other hand that was pallid, bland, ineffective, absent nonsense from Arsenal. Perhaps a low for the Emery \u201cera\u201d. 90+4 min: The pressure abates, Chambers picks up a booking for dissent, and Sheffield United are so nearly there ... 90+2 min: Another corner is met by a Blades head and it is now anywhere-will-do territory as the home side slash the ball far upfield. 90+1 min: Arsenal have FIVE minutes to score the goal they have rarely threatened. 89 min: The ball reaches an unmarked Chambers on the right side of the area and anything could happen as he lashes a cross-shot across goal. What does occur is that it\u2019s deflected heart-stoppingly wide and Arsenal make nothing of the corner. 87 min: And now McBurnie heads a left-wing corner not too far over. This is where the Blades want the action to be. 86 min: In his first act, McBurnie draws a chop from, and a booking for, Sokratis. 85 min: They have a breather now as Sharp is fouled in the middle. Then Norwood comes off and on jogs McBurnie. 83 min: Another Arsenal corner leads to nothing but I expect pretty much wall-to-wall pressure from here. The Blades are so close to a big, big win ... 82 min: Fleck is a decent shout for man of the match and almost sets up a glimpse on the counter after a delightful flick opens up the midfield. 80 min: It\u2019s one full-back to another as Chambers crosses deep to the onrushing Kolasinac, who has a pretty good chance at the back stick there and should do better than head well over. 78 min: Emery makes his third change and it\u2019s Gabriel Martinelli, the superbly talented young Brazilian striker, replacing the again-disappointing Pepe. The hosts make a switch too, McGoldrick off and Luke Freeman on. 76 min: Norwood drills wide from range after smart hold-up play from Sharp. The hosts remain a genuine threat on the break. 75 min: Pepe\u2019s best moment yet, now, as he takes aim from 25 yards a little more effectively but blasts a yard wide. Sheffield United just need to be careful here. Arsenal don\u2019t look good but Lacazette\u2019s arrival has definitely perked them. Henderson is booked by Dean as he attempts to kill some time at a goal kick. 73 min: ... which is on target from Pepe but well marshalled by the calm, composed Henderson. 72 min: Now Arsenal have a very, very interesting-looking free-kick just outside the box as McGoldrick catches Lacazette. It\u2019s on for the shot .... 70 min: Some really fine work from Saka ends with a delicate delivery towards Pepe, excellently defended by Basham. It\u2019s a corner and, for the first time really, the away fans roar. They then groan as another poor delivery from Pepe reaches Henderson. 69 min: Now we do see the return of Lacazette, who I think may well be Arsenal\u2019s best player. He is on for the captain, Xhaka. 67 min: Fleck thuds a really meaty one from fully 35 yards and Leno spills it ... but McGoldrick can\u2019t quite snaffle up the rebound in time. I fancy another goal in this one, for someone. 66 min: Guendouzi appears to fell McGoldrick on halfway but no, McGoldrick has \u2013 like Saka earlier \u2013 dived and gets a yellow. Kolasinac is also booked for reasons unclear. 65 min: In the meantime Arsenal win a right-sided corner. It\u2019s poor from Pepe, aimed low to the near post and hacked away. And this is a useful take from Ewan on the excellent Fleck. Doesn\u2019t seem so. The service is woeful. 63 min: Might be time for Lacazette soon. Arsenal really don\u2019t have a lot out there. Even though there is still every chance Aubameyang will still paper over the gaping cracks yet again. 61 min: Close! Nice interplay involving McGoldrick and Lundstram ends with Fleck leathering a left-footer into the side netting with Leno at full stretch. Half the crowd thought that was in. 60 min: So of course they come fairly close to scoring now, Saka dinking across for what should probably be a crisp volley into the net by Ceballos. Instead Stevens does just enough to get in the sub\u2019s sights and the shot is relatively harmless for Henderson. 59 min: Arsenal may have had a fair chunk of the ball since half-time but they do not look remotely like scoring. There\u2019s no verve, speed, intensity. Any of that is coming from the Blades, who look more assertive again now and see Baldock shoot wide. 56 min: A change for the Blades. Club legend Billy Sharp is on for the possible matchwinner, Mousset. I think he\u2019s got some sort of knock. Useful explanation of What Is Going On Out There. 53 min: Mousset is found in all sorts of space by a Fleck diagonal after some ballwatching by Kolasinac and Arsenal are very lucky that the forward handballs when trying to control. 52 min: Mousset buys himself a free-kick from Sokratis and Sheffield United can get a foot on the ball for the first time in the half, really. 50 min: The early pattern here is of Arsenal possession. The Blades don\u2019t want \u2013 or need \u2013 to sit in too deep too early, though. 49 min: Your takes on Arsenal are actually flooding in now but don\u2019t be offended if we have to focus on the game for the moment. Depending on events, I\u2019ll try to stick a few more up for everyone\u2019s consideration at the end. 47 min: Arsenal spring straight up the field and win an early corner. It\u2019s a decent enough delivery from Pepe but McGoldrick nuts it away. Arsenal bring Ceballos on for Willock, who is a super young player but simply didn\u2019t get a kick in the first half. Oh hold on, two more: Anders Stenberg \u2013 \u201cBest group of young players since at least 10 years. A necessary ingredient for most great teams, despite all the billions in the game. Think Barca, United, Bayern and just recently even Spurs. That is the positive. The negative is that one never knows how they will develop, but I am actually more excited now than I have been 5-6 years.\u201d Mike Nichols \u2013 \u201cPierre-Emerick Aubameyang dragging an entire club, kicking and screaming, into the Champions League places.\u201d Anyway, second half on its way. You\u2019ve all been very helpful but I still don\u2019t know what Emery\u2019s Arsenal are. Any clues coming up in the next 45? Russell Eberts writes: \u201cEmery strikes me as a villain from an old TV show or movie (Adam West\u2019s Batman, maybe, or an old Bond film). He cooks up overly-elaborate plans that he\u2019s convinced himself are genius, only to see them fall apart spectacularly as soon as they\u2019re put into action. No one is entirely sure what he\u2019s trying to accomplish, but it\u2019s very clear that he\u2019s failing miserably.\u201d \u201cThey are like a chicken without a head and, worse, a heart,\u201d says Peter Tuhill. So a thigh, a leg or a breast? I\u2019ll be back in a few minutes. If you could all let me know exactly what this Arsenal team *is* in the meantime I\u2019d be delighted to hear, because I don\u2019t have a clue. \u201cBased on the evidence on display so far, Arsenal\u2019s defence have not passed the Lys Mousset, er, the litmus test,\u201d notes Peter Oh. One clear chance apiece and the Blades have taken theirs! 45+1 min: A lovely turn and run from Pepe almost gives Aubameyang a chance ... then Xhaka takes aim with a hammer of a 30-yarder as the ball sits up and Henderson batters it round the post. Arsenal\u2019s best moment so far, not counting Pepe\u2019s miss. Xhaka glances a looping header wide from the corner. 44 min: A corner for Arsenal now though. Can they square it up before the break? Spoiler: no. 43 min: Arsenal have been quite positive since conceding but seem so short of craft in the middle. Imagine if they had a world-class German playmaker watching from a sofa somewhere in north London! That\u2019d be daft, surely. 40 min: Norwood intercepts a slack Leno ball from the back and Arsenal are lucky that it zips away from danger. 39 min: Another yellow now, this time for O\u2019Connell, who rather cynically stopped a Pepe break. 36 min: Now Dean gets a moment in the spotlight! Kolasinac plays Saka in down the left and he tumbles over Egan\u2019s challenge. Penalty? No! Dean books the winger for diving. Arsenal are furious but I think the ref was right there, you know! There was no contact. Freddie Ljungberg, on the side, certainly doesn\u2019t agree and is also booked. 34 min: Aubameyang takes aim from the edge of the area but it\u2019s blocked for a corner, moments after Baldock tumbles dramatically in the box with Kolasinac beside him. No penalty was given. Arsenal try to be fancy with the corner but it\u2019s snaffled away. 32 min: No, it was O\u2019Connell with that header across. But who was picking up Mousset? They find a good delivery for the first time! And Arsenal prove my words about their solidity stupid. Norwood swings the corner to the back stick, Egan \u2013 I think \u2013 wins the back-post header and Mousset, all alone close to the goal, stabs in the opener! 30 min: The lively, overlapping Stevens forces yet another corner. From which ... 28 min: It really hasn\u2019t been a classic yet but, remember, Arsenal really should be a goal up through Pepe, whose start to Premier League life has been rocky. 26 min: Arsenal have, whisper it, looked pretty solid so far despite some smart approach play from United, particularly down the left. 24 min: Chambers heads out a Norwood free-kick for the Blades\u2019 latest corner. Once again, no chance results. 21 min: But that should be 1-0 to Arsenal. Pepe should score his first goal from open play here, a rapid counter bringing a perfect delivery from the left from Kolasinac. Pepe is unmarked in front of goal but, swinging for the ball with his left foot when maybe he should wait for it to reach his wide, barely makes any contact and skews well wide. It\u2019s a bad miss. 20 min: McGoldrick helps the ball to Fleck, deep into the Arsenal box on the left, but David Luiz clears. Then a Stevens drilled delivery strikes Mousset, and ultimately it\u2019s another Blades corner. Leno fists it away, but this is a decent spell of home pressure. 17 min: Pepe does well to find Saka on the left of the area but Baldock holds him up equally adeptly and Arsenal\u2019s momentum slows. 15 min: Now Dean has ample excuse to flash a yellow as Fleck scythes in late on Aubameyang. He makes no mistake, reaching for his pocket and displaying the card with aplomb. 14 min: David Luiz earns cheers from the home crowd with a misplaced ball, unopposed, that he sends out for a throw-in. Wouldn\u2019t get away with that when their opponents are lurking. From the resulting throw-in the hosts win their third corner, which is thudded out at the near post by the head of Xhaka. 12 min: Scruffy stuff after that flurry of early corners, but Arsenal look reasonably snappy. 9 min: A few meaty challenges flying in. Arsenal will have to stand up physically here and have shown an appetite to so far. 7 min: Replays show Egan got a handful of Sokratis during that last corner. Should Arsenal have had an early penalty? 6 min: A few signs from a lively home side that Arsenal shouldn\u2019t engage in their customary messing about at the back. Then a sign that Pepe might have the run on O\u2019Connell today as he runs beyond the defender and rolls a lovely ball tantalisingly across goal. Arsenal keep up the pressure and win three consecutive corners, albeit to little end. Good start, full of intent, here from both. 3 min: It\u2019s played short by Norwood but they rush it a bit and nothing results straightaway, although they do eventually earn another flag kick that Luiz heads away. 2 min: Guendouzi checks O\u2019Connell and concedes a foul, but Mike Dean keeps his cards tucked away. The Blades then win the game\u2019s first corner ... They shoot from left to right. The teams are out on the pitch and preparing to start! It\u2019s a crackling atmosphere up there. JR in Illinois fumes: \u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018Where\u2019s Ozil?\u2019 or \u2018Where\u2019s Torreira?\u2019 the real question is \u2018Where\u2019s Tierney?\u2019 He\u2019s way better than Kolasinac. Why\u2019s he on the bench? Emery doesn\u2019t know what in the effing hell he\u2019s doing!\u201d I suspect Tierney will be first choice in that position within a fortnight. Admir Pajic writes: \u201cThe goalkeeping cameo wasn\u2019t the last bit of Phil Jagielka\u2019s heroics against Arsenal. Last season, he started for Everton only because Michael Keane, who had been named in the starting line-up, had to sit that one out due illness. Jagielka took the chance and scored the only goal in a 1-0 victory for Toffees. \u201cAs an Arsenal fan, I can\u2019t help myself thinking that both we\u2019ve been riding our luck this season and that we could\u2019ve easily been closer to Liverpool than we are now. We have enough firepower to Ferguson our way through the teams between 11th and 20th without fuss and our defence should be more reliable against top half teams. Unfortunately, Unai Emery thinks Mesut \u00d6zil\u2019s talent is not unique and that Granit Xhaka\u2019s is. Lucas Torreira was at heart of our improved performances in big games last season only to get benched regularly this term. If you ask me, give Arsene Wenger these players to pick from and we\u2019d have a three-horse title race. With Emery, 5th place is more likely.\u201d Emery speaks! But he doesn\u2019t really say anything worth transcribing, which isn\u2019t really anything new. It\u2019ll be a tough game like every match. And Arsenal must impose their gameplan. That\u2019ll do. He did make the point that Sheffield United are very mobile, in all fairness. More on Sheffield United\u2019s front line: Lys Mousset, who is just 23 but strikes me already as one of those players who hits 30 before you know it and is still a \u201cprospect\u201d makes his first top flight start for the Blades. \u201cI don\u2019t care about the money he is making. I just want him in the pitch giving Auba some service,\u201d says Charles Little of Ozil, not unreasonably. \u201cWhen will Emery reveal what his plans are regarding the \u00d8zil enigma? Never has anybody made that much money from so little time on the pitch,\u201d sniffs Henrik Nielsen. For the Blades, star striker Ollie McBurnie makes the bench. He\u2019s been struggling with a knee injury. \u201cOzil being absent is just a smoke screen to keep us from asking the real question \u2013 where is Torreira?\u201d muses Filip Gieldon. \u201cI\u2019m firmly moving into the Emery-out camp based on this decision by the manag ... sorry ... *head coach*.\u201d Sheff Utd: Henderson, Basham, Egan, O\u2019Connell, Baldock, Lundstram, Norwood, Fleck, Stevens, McGoldrick, Mousset. Subs: Luke Freeman, McBurnie, Sharp, Robinson, Jagielka, Moore, Besic. Arsenal: Leno, Chambers, Papastathopoulos, Luiz, Kolasinac, Guendouzi, Xhaka, Pepe, Willock, Saka, Aubameyang. Subs: Tierney, Ceballos, Lacazette, Torreira, Holding, Martinez, Martinelli. Referee: Mike Dean! Lacazette is back on the bench for Arsenal. Mesut Ozil is nowhere to be seen, once again. Back in a few minutes with more buildup ... Monday night football! And a tussle that should be bracingly fun, even if I can\u2019t promise you a goalkeeping cameo from Phil Jagielka this time around. Nobody quite knows what we\u2019re going to get from either of these two sides but, at a snapping and snarling Bramall Lane under the lights, I\u2019ve a feeling it is going to be good. But who for, overall? Arsenal are accidentally doing quite well and will return to third if they win, and still four points clear of Crisis Club Tottenham if they draw. Do they convince you? Of course they don\u2019t, and they don\u2019t convince me either, but they\u2019ve picked up that winning knack largely because they have a matchwinner \u2013 Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang \u2013 who is better than almost anyone else in the league. If Unai Emery could just refine the rest of it, who\u2019s to say they can\u2019t finish the season back in those hallowed Champions League spots? The Blades might want a hand in that conversation, for tonight at least. Remember how they rattled Liverpool? Arsenal seem eminently rattle-able and there\u2019s no doubt Chris Wilder\u2019s side play some delightfully intense, intelligent, insistent football whose style and quality still aren\u2019t appreciated quite as much as they should be. If they\u2019re on it tonight then you\u2019ll hear the strains of \u201cGreasy Chip Butty\u201d as far away as Leeds. The more they can take points from games like this, the less likely they are to face a relegation battle. I fancy they won\u2019t have to worry about that, when push comes to show. So let\u2019s strap in and enjoy. Send in your emails, tweets and goodness knows what else \u2013 and we\u2019ll hold each other\u2019s hands through the madness.",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from us this evening. Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s main events: The bill with which the government hopes to implement its Brexit deal was introduced. Some MPs complained that the three days they were given to scrutinise the draft legislation was insufficient and amounted to an attempt to prevent proper scrutiny. Boris Johnson has been denied the opportunity to hold a second vote on his Brexit deal in the House of Commons after the Speaker, John Bercow, ruled that it would be \u201crepetitive and disorderly\u201d. Bercow said it would break longstanding conventions for MPs to debate and vote on the agreement struck in Brussels last week, little more than two days after Saturday\u2019s historic sitting. \u201cToday\u2019s motion is in substance the same as Saturday\u2019s motion, and the house has decided the matter. Today\u2019s circumstances are in substance the same as Saturday\u2019s circumstances,\u201d Bercow said in the Commons on Monday. Soft Brexit Tory MPs and independents are resisting the idea of attaching a customs union to Boris Johnson\u2019s withdrawal agreement bill, meaning it would likely need an alliance of all opposition parties to pass. Conservative MPs and former Tories, who previously backed the idea of a customs union, suggested on Tuesday they would prefer not to reopen the issue and wanted to support Johnson\u2019s deal. Damian Green, the leader of the One Nation caucus, and Oliver Letwin, who has been heavily involved in the parliamentary fight against a no-deal Brexit, both indicated they would back Johnson\u2019s deal without a customs union appended. The unconventional \u201cform\u201d of Boris Johnson\u2019s extension request is irrelevant to the EU, the European commission has confirmed, as Germany\u2019s economic affairs minister said \u201cit goes without saying\u201d that a further Brexit delay would be granted. Peter Altmaier, a key ally of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said he believed either a technical extension to allow extra time for legislation to pass, or a longer period to accommodate a general election or second referendum would be offered. Scotland\u2019s most senior judge, Lord Carloway, has rejected a call by the UK government to end a case examining whether Boris Johnson broke a promise that he would not try to sabotage the request for a Brexit extension. After losing a Commons vote on Saturday on delaying his deal, Johnson sent an unsigned copy of the letter required by the Benn act but also sent another, personal, letter to Brussels that asked EU leaders not to agree to an extension. The judge said he would continue with the case until it was clear that Downing Street had complied with the act in full. Northern Ireland\u2019s unionist parties have recalled the Stormont assembly today in a last-minute attempt to stop the decriminalisation of abortion from coming into effect. The region\u2019s restrictive abortion laws are set to change at midnight on Monday after the Commons voted last July to bring reproductive rights in Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the UK. If you\u2019d like to read yet more, my colleagues Heather Stewart and Rowena Mason have the full story: Earlier, we reported that the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has announced a review of the immunity arrangements for US personnel and their families at the RAF Croughton annex, following the death of Harry Dunn. Now, a spokesman for Dunn\u2019s family, Radd Seiger, has told the Press Association: The family just has absolutely no confidence in Dominic Raab. He said we didn\u2019t go to him or his department for help while we were in the United States \u2013 that\u2019s because he is the last person we would go to for help after the meeting we had with him. The family are angry tonight. They are probably angrier now than they have been at any stage in this entire process. Dominic Raab said the ball is in Northamptonshire police\u2019s court for keeping us up to date with the investigation. The chief constable has told us he can\u2019t answer the questions we had for him. Somebody is lying and the family are sick of it. The leader of the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, has set out the timetabling of the bill\u2019s progress through parliament. Responding to an intervention by the Independent Group for Change MP, Anna Soubry, he has said: The second reading debate will be the normal second reading debate and will go to seven o\u2019clock tomorrow. On the second day, 12 hours of sitting divided into four sections of three hours with a specific section reserved, and the right honourable lady, the member for Broxtowe, might be pleased about this, with three hours specifically reserved for motions relating to a second referendum. So, members who are concerned about that will have the opportunity to debate it. And then, on Thursday, eight hours for proceedings on consideration up to and including third reading. The shadow Brexit secretary, Labour\u2019s Keir Starmer, has accused the prime minister of seeking to prevent proper scrutiny of his bill. This is a bill to implement Boris Johnson\u2019s deeply flawed plan for Brexit. It is outrageous to deny parliament the chance to scrutinise this incredibly important legislation properly. Ministers are trying to bounce MPs into signing off a bill that could cause huge damage to our country. We can\u2019t trust this prime minister. The truth is Boris Johnson knows that the more time people have to read the small print of his deal, the more it will be exposed for the risks it represents to our economy and communities across the country. The government has been accused of trying to ram through its Brexit deal this evening. The EU withdrawal agreement bill has just been introduced for its first reading and MPs will be debating it tomorrow. After the bill\u2019s introduction, the Independent Group for Change MP, Chris Leslie, told MPs: We know, for example, that Commons committee stage of the Treaty of Rome was not three days, or two days, it was 22 days. For the Maastricht Treaty, 23 days in committee stage. The Treaty of Lisbon: 11 days. Treaty of Amsterdam: five days. Then the Single European Act four days and then the smallest of them all the Treaty of Nice three days at committee. So, in total, five days of Commons consideration for the Treaty of Nice to be reformed. So, this is an unprecedentedly short period of time to dedicate to a massive and momentous piece of legislation. And, personally Mr Speaker, I am very worried that this motion that we are now debating, (is) the first in a series of attempts by the government to stage what is essentially the ramming through of a piece of legislation, in I regard a disorderly way. The withdrawal agreement bill includes a provision to enable the prime minister\u2019s Brexit deal to be ratified in time for the UK to leave with an agreement on 31 October. Under the provisions of the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act (CRAG), an international treaty \u2013 such as the Brexit deal \u2013 must be laid before Parliament for at least 21 sitting days before ratification to take place. However, in order for the government\u2019s timetable to be met, there is a provision in the WAB which \u201cdisapplies\u201d the relevant section of the CRAG. The withdrawal agreement bill has been given its first reading in the House of Commons, with MPs now poring over every line in the text and explanatory notes. It contains some protections on workers\u2019 rights, such as a \u201cnon-regression principle\u201d and the promise that parliament would get a vote on the negotiating mandate for the EU future relationship and the form of a final trade deal. However, it remains to be seen whether this will be enough to convince wavering pro-deal Labour MPs to vote for it. There is also the potential for hardline Eurosceptics to balk at some elements when they look at the detail of what will happen in the transition period and the potential for that to be extended for another two years. Soft Brexit Tories may also not be convinced there are enough safeguards to stop the UK crashing out on WTO terms at the end of the transition period at the end of 2020. The Liberal Democrats\u2019 Brexit spokesman Tom Brake has responded to the publication of the withdrawal agreement bill, saying: The Tory Brexit plan would hurt jobs, the environment and vital public services including the NHS. The Conservative government is trying to crash this bill through Parliament before anyone realises just how bad it is. MPs have had a chance to vote on Brexit again and again, yet as the Conservative government bring another withdrawal agreement to parliament they still refuse to let the people have the final say. If parliamentarians can change their minds then the people should be able to too. Liberal Democrats will continue to fight to stop Brexit. Our priority is to secure a People\u2019s Vote with the option to stay in the EU. The government has published the full text of the European Union (withdrawal agreement) bill. The document, which sets out how the government intends to implement the Brexit deal, runs to 110 pages and MPs have been given until Thursday to scrutinise it and vote on it. Here\u2019s a brief look at it, courtesy of Huffington Post UK\u2019s Paul Waugh: The immunity arrangements for US personnel and their families at the RAF Croughton annex will be reviewed in the aftermath of the death of Harry Dunn, the foreign secretary Dominic Raab has said. He has told MPs: We will continue to fight for justice for them. I\u2019ve already commissioned a review of the immunity arrangements for US personnel and their families at the Croughton annex holding privileges and immunities under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. As this case has demonstrated, I do not believe the current arrangements are right and the review will look at how we can make sure that the arrangements at Croughton cannot be used in this way again. Gove has confirmed that direct rule of Northern Ireland by Westminster would be necessary if Stormont is not back up and running once Brexit goes through. But he says it\u2019s a step \u201cno one should take lightly\u201d. In response, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, Jon Trickett, said: The prime minister thinks the only way to get legislation for this sellout deal through this House of Commons is to bully and blackmail MPs with the threat of no deal. But the prime minister has lost the consent of the House. He double-crossed the DUP. He\u2019s taken a bulldozer to most of our procedures. He reminds me more than anything else of acting in the manner of the Godfather, casting confetti at a Mafia family wedding in the way that he\u2019s disposed of the goodwill of the House. Continuing his statement, Gove said: It remains the case that Northern Ireland will face unique challenges in a no-deal Brexit and we will need to take steps to ensure effective governance and to give direction to the Northern Ireland civil service. This arrangement settlement has been sustainable to date, but leaving without a deal would represent a formidable challenge to the current position. In that case, we would have to start formal engagement with the Irish government about further arrangements for providing strengthened decision-making, and that would include the real possibility of restoring a form of direct rule. We will, of course, do everything to ensure that the interests of all communities across Ireland were safeguarded in any arrangements. We all must recognise that this would be a gravestone, from which experience shows us it would be hard to return, particularly in the context of leaving without a deal. Madame deputy speaker, even as we prepare for the challenges of no-deal, we will make the case at every forum that we can for leaving with a good deal. Delivering a statement to MPs on the government\u2019s preparations for a no-deal Brexit, the minister responsible \u2013 Michael Gove \u2013 has said: Parliament had the opportunity on Saturday to support a meaningful vote which would have allowed us to proceed smoothly to ratification of our deal and exit on 31 October. But the House instead voted in such a way as to put an orderly exit on that day in doubt. With no clear agreement yet in this House to ratify our withdrawal agreement and no certainty that an extension will be granted by 31 October, I must I fear take the appropriate steps now to prepare for the increased possibility that the legal default position will follow, and we will leave on 31 October without a deal. The clear advice to me now from officials is that we must now intensify contingency arrangements. We will now accelerate our efforts to help businesses and individuals mitigate any dislocation and disruption that may ensue. Hundreds of public servants across the UK will have to be redeployed, they will transfer to work in operation centres ready to identify challenges, work together to resolve problems quickly, and implement contingency plans. And, of course, we must maintain our public information campaign, from tomorrow this will reflect the renewed urgency of preparation.\u201d Ken Clarke, now sitting as an independent MP, has said all-night Commons sittings were used when debating the Maastricht Treaty in 1992 and much time was given to the original European Communities bill. Clarke, who had the Conservative whip removed after he backed attempts to block the UK leaving the EU without a deal, asked the leader of the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg: They were both debated for weeks on end with many all-night sittings. I think the Maastricht Bill we had at least 20-odd days sitting in order to satisfy the Eurosceptic members of the Conservative party who wanted full discussion of it. So, can my right honourable friend reassure me that the government is not simply to try to confine debate by narrowing the time and it is content, if the House wishes, to facilitate as much time as we need to consider it carefully? And I see no reason at all why we should just all rise in the evening so that everybody can go to dinner and not sit on a Friday for the convenience of the House of Lords. If the government is, for some reason, insistent on dashing for this completely silly and irrelevant date which it keeps staking its fate on then give some proper time for debate. Two-and-a-bit days of ordinary parliamentary hours is plainly quite insufficient. Rees-Mogg responded by describing Clarke as \u201csomebody who has always wanted us to remain in the European Union and disapproves of referendums\u201d. This is relevant, he says, because Clarke has never tried to hide his views using procedural methods. Using accelerated procedures has come about because of the deadline that we have of 31 October. And here I disagree with him: This is not a phony deadline. The deadline was set because of the work of article 50 and, the point being, that it should have ended in March. The SNP Commons leader, Pete Wishart, said: What he proposes in this business statement around the withdrawal agreement bill is totally unacceptable. Three days to consider a bill, somebody suggested it\u2019s 100 pages, how on earth are we going to have the chance to assess that properly? No economic impacts, no economic assessments. Wishart said it was only last week that the Queen \u201cput on her best crown\u201d and came to Parliament for the Queen\u2019s Speech. He asked when that would be discussed, and asked if it was just a \u201csupreme waste of time\u201d. Rees-Mogg told the Commons the \u201cBenn act and another known as the Boles Cooper act\u201d were brought through at short notice. He said: \u201cA king emperor left in 24 hours, and we are removing an imperial yoke in over a week.\u201d Back to Brexit and the shadow Commons leader, Valerie Vaz, has told MPs: At every stage, the government has been running scared of this House and democracy and it\u2019s now attempting to force through a flawed Brexit deal which sells out people\u2019s jobs, rights and our communities. The Commons leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg, began his reply by condemning abuse aimed at politicians after he and his son were targeted as they left Parliament on Saturday. I\u2019ve had many really kind inquiries about my son. He is a 12-year-old boy, he found nothing more exciting than being escorted home by the police \u2013 I\u2019m not sure he should have found it so exciting but he did. As a really serious point, I think it\u2019s very important that MPs can come and go from the precincts of Parliament feeling safe, and we must think about whether there\u2019s more we need to do and whether sessional orders may be helpful in that regard. Rees-Mogg said the withdrawal agreement bill\u2019s programme motion, which outlines its timetable, will be \u201cdown tonight in an orderly way\u201d before noting: \u201cThe bill, of course, won\u2019t be pulled.\u201d He also dismissed Vaz\u2019s claims and pointed to the government\u2019s two attempts to hold an election, adding: \u201cIf anybody is frit they are on the opposition benches.\u201d DUP MPs have asked for clarification from the UK government on whether Northern Ireland goods travelling to other parts of the UK will require customs declarations. The DUP MP Gavin Robinson said: Mr Speaker these responses are calamitous. Can he answer that question that was asked earlier: is it the case that Northern Ireland goods will require customs declarations to enter what is supposed to be unfettered access to the rest of their own country? To heckles of \u201canswer it\u201d from fellow DUP MPs, Smith said: On the issue of checks and forms, unfettered access is a key part of this protocol, and I\u2019ll be working to ensure we deliver on that in the interest of Northern Ireland business in the coming weeks. Calling for Stormont MLAs to have their pay reduced again due to the deadlock, Lady Sylvia Hermon said: As members of the legislative assembly at Stormont continue to be unable to fulfil their responsibilities, what consideration has the secretary of state given to cutting their salaries yet again? Smith said: I plan to review all elements relating to the assembly if we\u2019re unable to move things forwards over the coming days. The chairman of the Commons Northern Ireland select committee, Simon Hoare, suggested that the UK Parliament consider legislating on the Irish Language act to get the talks at Stormont moving. The secretary of state has provided a window which could possibly see this House overcome the hurdle which seems insurmountable for the parties in Northern Ireland and that is to legislate for the Irish Language act; therefore taking it out of the debate between the principal parties in Northern Ireland and, in my judgment, removing the hurdle which the roadblock, sorry to mix my metaphors, to getting Stormont back up and running. Responding, Smith said: The Irish Language act is one of a number of issues that are being discussed in the talks process. I\u2019d say again the most important and the best way to resolve these issues is through the Stormont talks. Dodds\u2019 colleague, Sir Jeffrey M Donaldson, said he \u201ccannot emphasise enough\u201d how important the principle of consent is to unionists. The idea that a decision of the momentous nature of the one we will be expected to take in four years\u2019 time does not reflect adequately the principle of consent \u2013 as expressed in the Belfast agreement \u2013 has serious implications for our ability to support the restoration of devolution without that safeguard. And I say with all seriousness to the secretary of state, if this issue is not addressed it goes well beyond this Brexit deal. Responding, Smith told MPS: This protocol is for a reserved matter. It is not for the assembly. The Belfast agreement is extremely clear that there will be matters which will not be subject to the consent mechanism in the assembly. The DUP\u2019s Westminster leader, Nigel Dodds, accused the government of not doing enough to restore powersharing to Northern Ireland. On health, education, crime, policing, investment and all the rest of it still the government sits on its hands and allows no government for Northern Ireland. Is he now realising that with Brexit coming we have to have power in the hands of ministers whether in the assembly or here? We can\u2019t go on abdicating that decision? Smith was asked by the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Tony Lloyd, whether he could assure MPs the Police Service of Northern Ireland has the \u201cresources in the event of any form of civic disturbance?\u201d Lloyd said he didn\u2019t want to \u201cemphasise what kind of civic disturbance there could be\u201d but said there could be a \u201cperiod of prolonged public unrest\u201d. Smith replied: The government has invested a further \u00a320m, or nearly \u00a320m, and stands ready to continue to support the PSNI financially. This is a sensitive period, with police officers under threat day in, day out. But I am comforted that the PSNI is well resourced, and I think it is doing an exceptional job. I don\u2019t see any need for any circumstance for the British Army operating in that way. The PSNI are doing all of the functions along with our security services in an exceptional manner. In the Commons, the Northern Ireland Secretary, Julian Smith, has been facing questions. He has told MPs: A new legal framework for lawful access to abortion services in Northern Ireland will be put in place by 31 March 2020, in line with the 2018 UN CEDAW report. I will be consulting on the new framework very soon. On same-sex marriage and opposite-sex civil partnerships, regulations are to be made no later than 13 January 2020. There are two key areas we are going to consult on. How to allow for religious same-sex marriage ceremonies, and also the issue of conversion from civil partnership to marriage and vice-versa. At the latest, the first civil same-sex marriages will take place on the week of Valentine\u2019s Day 2020. There is clearly this concern about how does the [Northern Ireland] assembly \u2013 now the law is changing \u2013 how does it influence? It can influence, but we need to be clear that the law from tomorrow has changed across those two areas, and we can, obviously we will hear the views of the assembly, and we will work with them, but the law, from tomorrow, has changed. \u2022 Boris Johnson has been denied the opportunity to hold a second vote on his Brexit deal in the House of Commons after the Speaker, John Bercow, ruled that it would be \u201crepetitive and disorderly\u201d. Bercow said it would break longstanding conventions for MPs to debate and vote on the agreement struck in Brussels last week, little more than two days after Saturday\u2019s historic sitting. \u201cToday\u2019s motion is in substance the same as Saturday\u2019s motion, and the house has decided the matter. Today\u2019s circumstances are in substance the same as Saturday\u2019s circumstances,\u201d Bercow said in the Commons on Monday. \u2022 Soft-Brexit Tory MPs and independents are resisting the idea of attaching a customs union to Boris Johnson\u2019s withdrawal agreement bill, meaning it would likely need an alliance of all opposition parties to pass.

He added that the withdrawal agreement bill would be debated at second reading and committee stage on Tuesday, with further discussion on Wednesday before the conclusion of proceedings on Thursday. Rees-Mogg also spoke about his experience, and that of his son, as they were escorted by police out of parliament on Saturday. He was one of several MPs who the police guarded amid heckling. Diane Abbott was another. \u201cMy 12-year-old son found nothing more exciting than being escorted by police,\u201d said Rees-Mogg, who went on to say that it might be necessary to look at measures to ensure that MPs are able to come and go. For readers wondering where Boris Johnson was earlier when Steve Barclay was taking questions on Brexit, including some asking why the prime minister as not doing so, we\u2019ve been told by Downing Street that he is in Downing Street. But why wasn\u2019t Johnson taking questions? \u201cBecause Steve Barclay was,\u201d a spokesperson replied when asked. I\u2019ve conferred with colleagues and, as we understand it, convention is that you can\u2019t demand a particular minister replies to your urgent question. As it\u2019s urgent they might not be available, and more junior ministers do often fill in. In the Commons, the Northern Ireland secretary, Julian Smith, has been taking questions about Brexit, attempts to restore the assembly at Stormont and moves to decriminalise abortion. On the latter, Smith says that a consultation is due to start in the coming days. \u201cA new legal framework for lawful access to abortion services in Northern Ireland will be put in place by March 31 2020 in line with the 2018 UN CEDAW report. I will be consulting on the new framework very soon. \u201cOn same-sex marriage and opposite-sex civil partnerships, regulations are to be made no later than January 13 2020. \u201cThere are two key areas we are going to consult on. How to allow for religious same-sex marriage ceremonies, and also the issue of conversion from civil partnership to marriage and vice-versa.\u201d He added: \u201cAt the latest, the first civil same-sex marriages will take place on the week of Valentine\u2019s Day 2020.\u201d Beyond the UK and Europe, events at Westminster continue to generate head-scratching from media in other parts of the world. My colleague Daniel Avelar Guimar\u00e3es has been taking a look: In the US, the Washington Post highlighted Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201chumiliating defeat in the House of Commons\u201d on Saturday. Using a slightly more optimistic tone, the New York Times reports that Johnson \u201cstill has a surprisingly good chance of leading Britain out of the bloc\u201d because of disagreements within opposition parties regarding their strategy for Brexit. The view on Brexit from the Middle East is also far from unanimous. Israel\u2019s Haaretz said that Johnson faces a \u201cpotentially perilous ratification\u201d of his Brexit plans as opposition MPs try to amend his proposed divorce bill. On the other hand, UAE\u2019s the National said No 10 was \u201cincreasingly confident\u201d that it could get parliament\u2019s approval fin an upcoming vote, and mentioned that the pound \u201creached its highest in more than five months at $1.3011\u201d amid investor optimism. And in South American media, Britain is shown as a country in turmoil. In Brazil, Folha de S.Paulo compared Johnson\u2019s increasing isolation in parliament to the failures of his predecessors Theresa May and David Cameron, further describing Brexit as a \u201creputation-crushing machine\u201d for prime ministers. In neighbouring Argentina, La Nacion said divisions in the House of Commons reflected broader trends in British society, mentioning an Opinium/Observer poll that puts support for a second referendum at 42% against 43% who reject a new vote. The government is coming under fire this evening over confirmation by the Brexit Secretary, Stephen Barclay, that Northern Irish businesses will have to complete exit declarations when sending goods to Great Britain under the terms of the Brexit deal. As reported by Politico, Barclay was correcting an answer he gave minutes earlier to the House of Lords European Union committee, when he said he did not think such forms would be required under the deal. He told peers: \u201cWe\u2019ve said in terms of [trade] from NI to GB that it will be frictionless and so there wouldn\u2019t be [declaration forms].\u201d The Labour Peer, Stewart Wood, was the committee member who pressed Barclay and has been making hay on Twitter and says that Barclay\u2019s \u201crevelation\u201d confirms two things \u201c1. The GB-NI border inside the UK will, from a commercial point of view, feel like a real border. 2. The Govt is trying to push through a vote on the deal before the text of the Withdrawal Bill is seen for a reason: the contents are alarming.\u201d Nigel Farage, the Brexit Party leader, and the east Belfast DUP MP, Sammy Wilson, have both been weighing in: Urgent Brexit questions have been concluded now - the Northern Ireland secretary, Julian Smith, is taking questions - but the Westminster focus will shift back very swiftly in a while to Brexit when MPs react to the publication of the withdrawal agreement bill. They won\u2019t have long to read it, however, as the second reading of the bill \u2013 and with it, a chance to vote \u2013 comes as early as tomorrow. If you missed it, here\u2019s the moment from earlier when the Commons Speaker, John Bercow, ruled out allowing a meaningful vote on the Brexit deal. The Guardian\u2019s political editor, Heather Stewart, has filed this piece on how Boris Johnson has been denied the opportunity to hold a second vote on his Brexit deal in the House of Commons after the Speaker ruled it would be \u201crepetitive and disorderly\u201d. She adds that the government, meanwhile, still hopes to push the legislation necessary to enact Brexit through parliament in time to meet the 31 October deadline despite having reluctantly been compelled to send a letter asking for an extension to article 50, The withdrawal agreement bill was expected to be published later on Monday, with the key second reading vote likely to be held on Tuesday. MPs from across the house are then likely to table a string of amendments seeking to tweak the Brexit deal, including to force the government to negotiate a customs union with the EU27 and to subject it to a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d. So what happens now? There is \u201cdisappointment\u201d from Downing Street, in the first soundings coming out of the prime minster\u2019s spokesperson. Paul Waugh of Huffpost UK tweets: Meanwhile, the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn has been reporting on a fresh headache for the government (and anyone struggling to keep up with Brexit-related acronyms frankly): The Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, is speaking now and makes the case again for a new referendum. If the prime minister was allowed to change his mind \u2013 and request an extension \u2013 then surely the British people should be allowed to do so. Ian Blackford, the leader of the SNP at Westminster, wants to know the whereabouts of Boris Johnson, who he says has been utterly humiliated by his defeat in the House of Commons on Saturday. The unsigned letter that was sent to Brussels at the weekend \u201clacked respect\u201d, he adds. Barclay replies that the crux of the issue was that the prime minister had complied with the law and had set out his well-known views on the issue. There isn\u2019t any word from him about where Johnson is. Ken Clarke is on his feet now, asking that the date of 31 October should no longer have the \u201csacred quality\u201d it has attained, though he would be personally quite happy if a withdrawal can be secured in the right way. \u201cThe date was not selected by the British public or the British government. It was a compromise selected by President Macron and others and was plucked out of the air,\u201d he adds. Barclay says that the prime minister has confirmed that the UK government would abide by the law, but has also left no one in any dount about what his position is. \u201cWe in this house want to collude with the British public to get Brexit done,\u201d he adds, sidestepping that second Corbyn question about whether some MPs are facing potential investigations for \u201ccolluding with foreign governments\u201d. Points of order have been concluded and Jeremy Corbyn is on his feet with the first of urgent questions, asking the prime minister to make a statement on his request for an extension on Brexit. Steven Barclay, the minister for Exiting the EU, responds in place of Boris Johnson by saying that the letter was sent in compliance with section one of the Benn act. The Labour leader says he admires Barclay for keeping a straight face as he gave that answer, accusing Johnson of sending the letter with \u201cposturing and attempts to distract\u201d. Despite having said that he would never request an extension, Corbyn adds that the prime minister has done so. He asks when he expects any EU extension to be granted and if the government can rule out reports that MPs could face jail for \u201ccolluding\u201d with foreign governments. Bercow says he has the sense that his ruling is \u201cprocedurally right\u201d, however irksome it is to some in the chamber. The Spectator\u2019s assistant editor, Isabel Hardman, meanwhile, separates the contributions from the floor as follows: Bercow adds: \u201cI have made a principled judgment and there is every opportunity for the government to have its way, with the approval of parliament, by the end of October.\u201d Crispin Blunt, another Tory MP, is on his feet and says he is one of the members who has formally recorded what he says has been Bercow\u2019s \u201cpartiality\u201d in the chair. Blunt asks if Bercow\u2019s ruling might be altered on the basis of what the response from Brussels might be to the letter(s) sent at the weekend by Downing Street. Cue another Bercow impression \u2013 this time of Willie Whitelaw: \u201cPersonally I think it is better to cross bridges when I come to them.\u201d There\u2019s a bit of political kickabout over a second referendum by the former Tory, now LibDem, Sarah Wollaston and the Conservative MP Desmond Swayne. Swayne says with a smile that he believes Bercow is right, but adds: \u201cBy the same logic, It\u2019s quite right for the voters not to have to answer the same question again.\u201d Bercow is warming up a bit now, telling Jenkin: \u201cWhen he was getting decisions in his favour he was not grumbling. He is grumbling now because he is getting the judgments that he doesn\u2019t like.\u201d A translation from the BBC\u2019s Andrew Sinclair: Bercow continues to defend himself under questioning, saying that one of the reason for the rules he has invoked was to prevent \u201cconflicting\u201d rulings on similar issues coming soon after the other \u201cin short order\u201d. \u201cAnd what could be shorter order than the next sitting day after the last judgment was made \u2026 and that was the rationale for the perfectly reasonable judgment that I have made,\u201d says the Speaker. Bernard Jenkin, the Brexit-supporting Tory MP, is on his feet insisting that the motion the government wanted to be voted on today was very different from the one MPs considered on Saturday. To \u201cooohs\u201d, he adds that the public administration committee, which he chairs, will be holding a hearing on the role of the Speaker. Bercow replies that that it is absolutely right for the committee to do what it wanted to to and he was \u201centirely untroubled\u201d by it. Bercow breaks off into a (not unconvincing) Tony Benn impression to repeat the Labour MP\u2019s lament that politics should be about issues, not personalities, as he comes under further questioning about his ruling. The veteran Eurosceptic and Brexit, Bill Cash, has been on his feet urging Bercow to reconsider his decision in the light of the \u201claw of the land\u201d with regards to Britain\u2019s scheduled Brexit date. Bercow says he is stating the obvious: \u201cWhen you make a judgement on these matters that is controversial, some people are going to be pleased and some are going to be displeased.\u201d \u201cI have simply sought to discharge my obligations and to do what I believe to be right, and that is what the speaker has to do.\u201d The House of Commons Speaker, John Bercow, has ruled that he will not permit MPs to have a \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d on Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal today. \u201cMy ruling is that the motion will not be debated today as it would be repetitive and disorderly to do so,\u201d he told MPs. Bercow says he hopes that the ruling and explanation are helpful to the house, before allowing the Tory MP Peter Bone to come in with a point of order. To laughter, Bone tells him that no one knew that the prime minister was going to send a letter or not to the EU seeking a Brexit extension. Surely this something that changed the circumstances in which the vote would take place. Bercow says that the question of whether a minister of the crown \u201cwould obey the law\u201d would be a material consideration on his part was not one that he took into account. Bercow says it is clear that the motions before the house are \u201cin substance the same\u201d and that the matter was decided as recently as 48 hours ago. Bercow is on his feet and says he has been reflecting. There are two issues, one of substance and the other of circumstances, to consider, he adds. First, he has to consider if the motion tabled by the government for today is the same in substance as that which was decided during Saturday\u2019s sitting. This looks like the last question in defence questions. So which way will Bercow go? Here\u2019s Ian Dunt, the editor of Politics.co.uk on what\u2019ll happen if the Speaker (against expectations) gives a green light to a meaningful vote: And, meanwhile, a little sympathy for the notoriously shy (ahem) Mr Bercow \u2026 It\u2019s felt like a bit of a phoney war thus far today but we\u2019re minutes away from (potentially) a key moment, when we should learn if the Commons Speaker, John Bercow, will allow MPs to have a \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d on Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal. The word is that Bercow will be on his feet at about 3.35pm London time. Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, and junior ministers have been taking questions and that is due to start winding up shortly. The expectation is that Bercow will not permit such a vote given that the deal was debated by MPs on Saturday, and a backbench amendment attached, putting off final approval until the legislation surrounding the plan is agreed. Downing Street has also, meanwhile, said it would pull the vote if any amendments are selected that would \u201crender the vote pointless\u201d. \u201cThere is no point having a meaningless vote \u2013 the government would pull the motion. We will go ahead with the introduction of the WAB with second reading tomorrow,\u201d the PM\u2019s official spokesman said. An update from MEPs, via the Guardian\u2019s Brussels correspondent, Jennifer Rankin. The Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran has just told the BBC she would be \u201cminded\u201d to vote on a customs union amendment if it is in the right form, but added quickly that her party was still intent on pushing for a second referendum. MPs need more time to scrutinise the government\u2019s deal, however, she added. As well as writing to Boris Johnson, the first ministers for Wales and Scotland have also send one to the president of the European council, Donald Tusk, urging him to support an extension to Brexit that would allow MPs to scrutinise the deal \u2013 and perhaps even hold a second referendum. The BBC\u2019s Nick Eardley tweets: We heard earlier that Lisa Nandy had emerged as one of the Labour MPs who would support the withdrawal agreement bill (WAB) at second reading, but it seems fairly certain that it will be opposed by her party. The Guardian\u2019s deputy political editor, Rowena Mason, tweets: To recap, the second reading of the withdrawal agreement bill is likely to be held tomorrow if it is introduced later today. The second reading will be the first occasion that members of parliament can vote on the proposed legislation. News out of Brussels, though probably not of the type that will be welcomed by Brexit supporters hoping that they might have seen the last of Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator for the past number of years. He\u2019s not going away, reports Politico. The first ministers for Wales and Scotland, Mark Drakeford and Nicola Sturgeon, have written to the prime minister urging the UK government to secure an extension from the European council that respects devolution and \u201callows our legislatures to carry out their proper constitutional and democratic functions\u201d. Part of their letter states: This bill will be among the most important piece of legislation ever considered by the UK parliament, the Scottish parliament and national assembly for Wales with far-reaching implications for the whole of the United Kingdom and our future well-being. Both our governments believe the deal you have negotiated with the EU will be even more damaging to Wales, Scotland and the United Kingdom than the previous unacceptable agreement made by your predecessor. We therefore wish to state in the clearest possible terms that we and our legislatures need time to analyse and consider the draft bill. We share the view which lay behind the amendment passed by a clear majority of the House of Commons that the time between now and 31 October provides insufficient opportunity to undertake this essential scrutiny Scottish judges have delayed a final ruling on whether Boris Johnson is in contempt of court to ensure he agrees to an extension to Brexit. Lord Carloway, the country\u2019s most senior judge, said they needed to be sure the prime minister did not try to block or sabotage the application he was forced to make on Saturday night for an extension to Brexit until 31 January. The court\u2019s decision, issued after a short hearing at the court of session in Edinburgh, means Johnson faces being held in contempt if judges rule he has failed to honour pledges made to court not to frustrate the extension process. Johnson sent an unsigned letter seeking the extension after the Commons voted narrowly in favour of postponing a vote on the government\u2019s revised deal to leave the UK. The legislation, the European Union (Withdrawal) (No 2) Act, known as the Benn act, also requires the prime minister to accept an extension if it is offered by Brussels and the 27 other EU member states. The number-crunching continues around whether the numbers are there at Westminster for opposition parties to put a spoke in the wheel of the government today via an amendment creating a UK-wide customs union with the EU and single market alignment. While my colleague Peter Walker reckons that Labour, Liberal Democrats and others might just about \u201csqueak it\u201d if the DUP abstained, it\u2019s looking like a tall order. Joanna Cherry - the SNP MP and lawyer behind one of the series of court cases around the UK challenging Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament for five weeks \u2013 has been tweeting about an experience on the streets today, contrasting it with the protection afforded to Andrea Leadsom when the Tory minister was heckled on Saturday. An attempt by the DUP to suspend the standing orders of the Stormont assembly to push through a private member\u2019s bill that would maintain Northern Ireland\u2019s ban on abortion has failed, as expected, because it requires the election of a speaker on a cross-community basis. At the start of today\u2019s proceedings \u2013 viewed variously as a stunt designed to play to the DUP\u2019s political base at a time when the party has been wrong-footed over Brexit or an articulation of a point of principle \u2013 there was a bid by anti-abortion assembly members to fast-track a piece of private member\u2019s legislation through in a single day to thwart the abortion reform. While the DUP and other unionist members were in attendance, the rest of the chamber\u2019s benches were largely empty. Sinn F\u00e9in has made clear it will not turn up to a sitting it has described as a circus while SDLP members walked out after describing the convening of the assembly as a \u201cstunt\u201d and making it clear that they would not be participating in the election of a speaker. The developments come as the abortion law will change in Northern Ireland at midnight on Monday when the Executive Formation Act 2019 comes into effect. MPs at Westminster successfully amended the government bill in the summer to include measures to end the near blanket prohibition on abortion and introduce same sex marriage. The current speaker, Robin Newton, said a new speaker would need to be in place before the assembly could turn to such a legislative bid. Newton said a further sitting of the assembly would be required to consider the bill and highlighted that the suspension of standing orders required cross-community support. Here\u2019s some footage, via the BBC\u2019s Mark Simpson, of the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, appealing to Newton. \u2022 Downing Street has insisted that MPs must be given \u201ca straight up and down\u201d vote on its Brexit deal amid speculation that the Speaker, John Bercow, will not permit it to take place. The government also said that any attempt by MPs to add a customs union to the government\u2019s Brexit deal would be \u201cprocedural tricks\u201d intended to frustrate departure. The expectation is that Bercow will not permit such a vote given that the deal was debated by MPs on Saturday, and a backbench amendment attached, putting off final approval until the legislation surrounding the plan is agreed. \u2022 The unconventional \u201cform\u201d of Boris Johnson\u2019s extension request is irrelevant to the EU, the European commission has confirmed, as Germany\u2019s economic affairs minister said \u201cit goes without saying\u201d that a further Brexit delay would be granted. Peter Altmaier, a key ally of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said he believed either a technical extension to allow extra time for legislation to pass, or a longer period to accommodate a general election or second referendum would be offered. \u2022 Scotland\u2019s most senior judge, Lord Carloway, has rejected a call by the UK government to end a case examining whether Boris Johnson broke a promise that he would not try to sabotage the request for a Brexit extension. After losing a Commons vote on Saturday on delaying his deal, Johnson sent an unsigned copy of the letter required by the Benn act but also sent another, personal, letter to Brussels that asked EU leaders not to agree to an extension. The judge said he would continue with the case until it was clear that Downing Street had complied with the act in full. \u2022 Northern Ireland\u2019s unionist parties have recalled the Stormont assembly today in a last-minute attempt to stop the decriminalisation of abortion from coming into effect. The region\u2019s restrictive abortion laws are set to change at midnight on Monday after the Commons voted last July to bring reproductive rights in Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the UK. This is Ben Quinn picking up the blog now from Frances Perraudin. Northern Ireland\u2019s unionist parties have recalled the Stormont assembly today in a last-minute attempt to stop the decriminalisation of abortion from coming into effect, my colleague Daniel Avelar reports. The region\u2019s restrictive abortion laws are set to change at midnight on Monday after the Commons voted last July to bring reproductive rights in Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the UK. This will be the first time in nearly three years that the parliament in Belfast has met, since legislators from the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) and Sinn F\u00e9in nationalists failed to reach a power-sharing agreement after the devolved government collapsed in January 2017. The recall follows a petition promoted by anti-abortion campaigners and signed by 31 members of the legislative assembly (MLAs), aiming to put abortion rights back in the hands of local politicians. MLAs would need to form an executive before the midnight deadline to block the abortion reform, but that is highly unlikely as nationalist parties said their members would not attend today\u2019s session. Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, defended the recall, saying it would allow MLAs to \u201cdebate the issue\u201d of abortion in Northern Ireland, while a Sinn F\u00e9in spokesperson called it a \u201cpointless political stunt\u201d. As well as the decriminalisation of abortion, same-sex marriage is also due to become legal on Tuesday after a separate Westminster vote in July. Here\u2019s the full report from the Guardian\u2019s Ireland correspondent Rory Carroll. The Guardian\u2019s Scotland editor, Severin Carrell, is in court in Edinburgh where Lord Carloway has rejected a call by the UK government to halt proceedings because the prime minister has met his legal requirements under the Benn act. (See my earlier post.) The judge said he would continue with the case until it was clear that Downing Street had complied with the act in full \u2013 ie sought and, if it is offered, accepted a Brexit extension from the EU. A date for the next hearing is yet to be fixed. Labour MP Lisa Nandy has said that she would support the withdrawal agreement bill (the WAB) at second reading. Speaking on the BBC\u2019s Politics Live, she said MPs should be able to debate the substance of the bill and the terms on which we leave the EU before approving the deal (as per the Letwin amendment) and to do it the other way around (passing the meaningful vote before debating the WAB) was \u201cholding the country to ransom\u201d with the threat of no deal. She said she would support the bill at second reading but that the big question was what comes next. She tweeted this this morning: The Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, is appearing at the Lords EU select committee, where he is talking about \u201cscrutiny of Brexit negotiations\u201d. \u201cI think the deal is a win, not just for the UK, but for the EU as well, who want to see the UK leave in a smooth and orderly way. And it was obviously frustrating, I think, for many of us on Saturday that we were not able to have the meaningful vote,\u201d he said. Barclay said MPs had already voted on a range of amendments through the indicative vote process and rejected them. He said the Letwin amendment represented a \u201cmoving of the goalposts\u201d from the opposition claiming they were concerned about the prospect of no-deal Brexit to them saying the concern was now about wanting more time. He keeps describing the withdrawal agreement as \u201cthe winding down arrangements\u201d and stressing that there will be a lots of issues for MPs to debate when it comes to the \u201cfuture arrangements\u201d. The Guardian\u2019s Scotland editor, Severin Carrell, is in court in Edinburgh where Scotland\u2019s most senior judge, Lord Carloway, and two other judges will hear allegations that the prime minister broke a promise he made to the court that he would not try to sabotage the request for an extension. The UK government\u2019s lawyers pledged in writing and in court this month that the prime minister would honour the provisions of the Benn act, seeking an extension to article 50 if he failed to get a Brexit deal passed by 19 October. After losing a Commons vote on Saturday on delaying his deal, Johnson sent an unsigned copy of the letter required by the act but also sent another, personal letter to Brussels that asked EU leaders not to agree to an extension. Lawyers for three anti-Brexit campaigners are expected to argue that these steps are a clear breach of the government\u2019s promises to the court. If the three judges find Johnson is in contempt, he could theoretically face a fine or even jail. Here\u2019s Severin\u2019s curtain raiser article. He\u2019ll also be tweeting from court. The Guardian\u2019s deputy political editor, Rowena Mason, has this from the morning\u2019s lobby briefing. No 10 confirmed that the government will pull the meaningful vote if anyone tries to amend it with a \u201cLetwin 2\u201d-style change. This is all pretty hypothetical as John Bercow, the Speaker, seems likely to rule it out of order this afternoon. Why is the government so keen on a meaningful vote when it also needs to pass a withdrawal agreement bill? The theory is that if it passed, then Boris Johnson would try to rescind his request to the EU for an article 50 extension, arguing MPs have given their consent for a deal. This morning, No 10 refused to comment on whether this ruse could be tried. The European commission has confirmed that \u2013 despite the prime minister\u2019s unconventional approach to requesting a further Brexit delay \u2013 Brussels is considering the terms of a further prolongation of the UK\u2019s membership. A European commission spokeswoman said: President Tusk is now consulting leaders of the EU27 on this and it is first and foremost for the UK to explain the next steps. We from our side, of course, follow all the events in London this week very closely. What I can also add, the ratification process has been launched on the EU side. Michel Barnier debriefed EU ambassadors of the EU27 yesterday and he will debrief the European parliament\u2019s Brexit steering group this afternoon in Strasbourg. And as I mentioned, he will also debrief the college of commissioners. The request to extend article 50 was made by the UK\u2019s permanent representative to the EU. President Tusk acknowledged receipt of the request on Saturday and stated that he\u2019s now consulting with the EU27. So this form does not change anything. Lobby journalists are reporting that No 10 will pull the meaningful vote motion this afternoon if the Speaker allows amendments to it that render it \u201cmeaningless\u201d. \u201cThere is no point in having a meaningless vote,\u201d said the PM\u2019s spokesman. Another MP who previously backed a customs union is saying he would not support such an amendment this time. My colleague Kate Lyons has this round-up of today\u2019s papers. Some are angry at what they see as Labour\u2019s attempts to \u2013 as the Daily Mail puts it \u2013 \u201ccancel Brexit by sabotaging withdrawal legislation\u201d. The FT\u2019s Sebastian Payne has a little bit more on how the afternoon could unfold. Buzzfeed\u2019s Alex Wickham has been doing the maths on which MPs could back an amendment for a customs union. Damian Green, a Tory MP and former member of Theresa May\u2019s cabinet, has said that he would not vote for such an amendment. This is from the BBC\u2019s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg. We should find out around 2.30pm if Bercow is likely to allow the \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d this afternoon. The government has confirmed that its Brexit bill, which enshrines the prime minister\u2019s deal with the EU into UK law, will be published later today. A press release from the Department for exiting the European Union reads: This deal abolishes the backstop in the old deal. The Government put forward a reasonable compromise, based on the key principles of consent for the people of Northern Ireland, and the UK leaving the EU Customs Union whole and entire, which was agreed at European Council last week. The EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill puts those internationally agreed obligations into domestic law. This week MPs will have the chance to pass this bill, to respect the result of the referendum and to leave with a deal on October 31 in an orderly and friendly way. MPs voted overwhelmingly to trigger Article 50 in 2017 to start the process of leaving the EU and supporting this bill is the final stage to make that happen. This will allow the country to move on and for the Government to return its focus to delivering on the people\u2019s domestic priorities: investing in the NHS, tackling serious and violent crime, and levelling up funding on schools. The Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, is quoted: MPs and Peers will today have in front of them a bill that will get Brexit done by October 31, protect jobs and the integrity of the UK, and enable us to move onto the people\u2019s priorities like health, education and crime. Hugo Dixon, an anti-Brexit campaigner, has written this piece of analysis, accusing Boris Johnson of \u201cpeddling untruths and spraying around promises\u201d. The SNP\u2019s Joanna Cherry QC, who was involved in recent legal action aimed at forcing Boris Johnson to comply with the Benn act, has said she supports extending Brexit negotiations until the end of 2020 if needed for a second referendum. Appearing on the BBC\u2019s Good Morning Scotland, she was asked if she would back an extension until the end of next year. \u201cYes, I would,\u201d she replied. \u201cBecause the current deal that\u2019s been negotiated by Boris Johnson is immensely damaging to the British economy and particularly for Scotland.\u201d She pointed out that her party backed a second Brexit referendum at its autumn conference last year. \u201cWe need to get a government in place to deliver the referendum and I don\u2019t see Boris Johnson\u2019s government doing that,\u201d she said. \u201cThe SNP has been very clear that Boris Johnson should be removed from office once an extension is obtained.\u201d Rishi Sunak, the chief secretary to the Treasury, spoke to the BBC\u2019s Today programme earlier this morning. He said that any attempt by MPs to add a customs union to the government\u2019s Brexit deal would be \u201cprocedural tricks\u201d intended to frustrate departure. Sunak said the Speaker, John Bercow, should grant the government a second Commons vote on its deal on Monday, and that it would be \u201cslightly odd\u201d if he did not. \u201cPeople who are wanting to amend legislation are ultimately wanting to frustrate, delay or cancel Brexit altogether, and we should be clear about that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a deal that has been negotiated with the EU, that they themselves are happy with, and now want to get on with. I think everyone will look at that and think, this isn\u2019t the time for more games in parliament, more amendments, more procedural tricks, which are just covers for trying to frustrate Brexit altogether.\u201d Here\u2019s our story: This from the Guardian\u2019s Brussels bureau chief on Jim Shannon\u2019s earlier statement on a customs union. Here\u2019s a useful flow chart explaining what could happen this afternoon and beyond. Regardless of the possible meaningful vote this afternoon, the withdrawal agreement bill (WAB) is being introduced in the Commons today. A vote on second reading could come as soon as tomorrow. Here\u2019s a useful explainer from our deputy political editor, Rowena Mason. The DUP\u2019s Jim Shannon has told Sky his party would not support an amendment that would keep the UK in a customs union with the EU. Labour\u2019s Hilary Benn told BBC Breakfast there would likely be an amendment \u201cseeking to put this whole deal back to the British people\u201d, and another saying \u201cwe should remain in the customs union\u201d. A customs union amendment was thought to have a chance of succeeding \u2013 more of a chance than a second referendum amendment \u2013 but it would probably require support from the DUP. The DUP rejected Johnson\u2019s deal because it would require a border in the Irish Sea \u2013 a UK-wide customs union could solve that problem. A local branch of the Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru has announced it will contest Labour MP Chris Bryant\u2019s seat if he succeeds in becoming Speaker, in a departure from parliamentary convention. In a statement, Rhondda Plaid said: \u201cThe Rhondda is not Buckingham, the constituency of the current Speaker, John Bercow. The Rhondda has some serious social issues that need sorting out and need the attention of a dedicated, full-time MP. The Rhondda can ill-afford to be represented by a parliamentarian more concerned with pomp than poverty. \u201cThe people of the Rhondda should not be denied a say on who represents them at Westminster while so many levers of powers are retained by the UK government. The Rhondda deserves to choose who their next MP is; Plaid Cymru will ensure that there is a choice at the next general election if Chris Bryant is elected as Speaker in the House of Commons.\u201d House of Commons convention dictates that Speakers are elected unopposed; however, the Conservative party recently announced it would contest Bercow\u2019s seat in Buckingham if he remained in the role going into the next election. There is a creeping erosion of respect towards some parliamentary traditions. Bryant, MP since 2001 for the Rhondda Valley, a former coalmining area in South Wales, has a 14,000-vote majority in the seat over Plaid Cymru, which came second in 2017. The former junior minister is not considered the frontrunner for the role, with the former deputy prime minister Harriet Harman highly tipped, but he has been attempting to woo colleagues. Over the weekend, he declared the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority should consider financial provisions to cover childcare costs for MPs when they have to attend parliament on a Saturday, when the Commons nursery is closed. Lord Pannick QC, who led the successful challenge to the legality of the prorogation of parliament, has been speaking to the BBC\u2019s Today programme. Asked about Boris Johnson\u2019s move to send a letter to the EU requesting an extension \u2013 as required under the Benn act \u2013 but declining to sign it, Pannick said he thought that \u201con this occasion\u201d the prime minister was on the right side of the law. The Benn act required him to send a letter to the president of the European council seeking an extension and that\u2019s what he\u2019s done. The act doesn\u2019t requite that he sign the letter. The purpose of the act is to ensure that the EU can now make us an offer for an extension. If they do, the Benn act requires that the government accept it, so the Benn act has achieved its purpose. The act doesn\u2019t require the prime minister to abandon his political objectives and beliefs that we should leave on the 31st. I don\u2019t think that he\u2019s acted unlawfully. Pannick said he was bound by the Benn act to accept an extension unless he gets legislation through parliament by the 31st and gets approval for his deal. \u201cAnd I very much hope that is achieved,\u201d he said. The European Research Group chairman, Steve Baker, spoke to the Today programme a little earlier. He did not explicitly rule out backing the deal if it is amended to include a customs union arrangement but said he would reconsider his support. \u201cThe advice I gave to my Eurosceptic colleagues is we should, number one, back the deal,\u201d he said. \u201cNumber two, vote for the legislation all the way through unless, it has to be said, it was wrecked by opponents, in which case we would have to take a view. Baker called on the DUP to \u201cchoke down extremely difficult compromises\u201d and back the PM\u2019s Brexit deal. \u201cFor people like me, for vast areas of that withdrawal agreement are unchanged, and we are going to have to choke down our pride and vote in the national interest to get Brexit done,\u201d he said. I\u2019m not going to deny there are still problems with that withdrawal agreement, which I\u2019ve long complained about. We\u2019re going to compromise in the national interest to get us out of the European Union on time and I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m asking the DUP, just as we\u2019re having to choke down extremely difficult compromises to get out in the national interest \u2026 I would ask the DUP to accept this compromise. Today\u2019s Commons order paper has events kicking off in parliament with defence questions at 2.30pm, which will wrap up around 3.30pm. The following \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d motion could then be put to MPs: That this house approves for the purposes of section 13(1)(b) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 the following documents laid before the House on 19 October 2019: (1) the negotiated withdrawal agreement titled Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community; (2) the framework for the future relationship titled Political Declaration setting out the framework for the future relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom; (3) the unilateral declaration by the UK titled Declaration by Her Majesty\u2019s Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland concerning the operation of the Democratic consent in Northern Ireland provision of the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland. A note on the order paper reads: \u201cThe Speaker plans to make a statement on proceedings on this motion immediately after defence questions.\u201d Here\u2019s an interesting Twitter thread from Hannah White, the deputy director of the Institute for Government. She says she would be very surprised if Bercow were to allow another \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d motion. Good morning and welcome to Politics Live on what promises to be another jaw-dropping day in Westminster. I\u2019m Frances Perraudin and will be taking you through all this morning\u2019s developments before handing over to my colleague Ben Quinn this afternoon. Boris Johnson is going to make another attempt at getting his Brexit deal past MPs today after he failed to do so on Saturday. In a special sitting of parliament this weekend, Oliver Letwin, the former Tory minister, managed to amend the motion so that parliament withheld its support until MPs were able to pass the full Brexit legislation and properly scrutinise the deal. The amendment forced Johnson to send a letter to the EU requesting a three-month extension to article 50, which Brussels is considering. Undeterred, Johnson will have another go at winning parliamentary backing for his Brexit deal in a straight yes or no vote this afternoon. This would be a move to show support for his EU withdrawal agreement before MPs have the chance to scrutinise the full legislation and attach amendments. The Speaker, John Bercow, could block Johnson holding another \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d on the deal today, because the prime minister tried and failed to do so on Saturday, meaning parliament would be considering the same matter twice. The Labour party said last night that it would seek the backing of rebel Tories and the DUP for amendments that would force him to drop the deal \u2013 or accept a softer Brexit. You can read our full story here: According to an analysis of likely voting intentions by the Guardian\u2019s political team, support for Johnson\u2019s deal is still on a knife-edge, despite senior ministers claiming he has the numbers to get it through. Johnson appears to have got all of his 287 voting MPs on board with his plan, including his brother, Jo Johnson, who backed a second referendum but voted with the government on Saturday. He also has about 20 former Conservatives who left the party or had the whip suspended, plus likely votes from about eight Labour MPs. Another three independent MPs \u2013 former Labour ministers Ian Austin and Frank Field, plus former Liberal Democrat Stephen Lloyd \u2013 are all expected to back him.

Both are just 9cm long and weigh 5-6 grams \u2013 roughly the same as a single sheet of A4 paper or a 20p coin. Yet one species of warbler is just as small, though a gram or so heavier. Despite its size, Pallas\u2019s warbler \u2013 named after an eighteenth-century Prussian ornithologist \u2013 travels all the way from its Siberian breeding grounds to Britain. Until the 1980s this Siberian sprite was a very rare vagrant, with only a few occurring each autumn.

      "bodyText": "Facebook on Monday disclosed it had taken down four new foreign interference operations originating from Iran and Russia, including one targeting the US 2020 presidential elections that appears to be linked to the Russian troll agency, the Internet Research Agency (IRA). The suspected IRA campaign \u201chad the hallmarks of a well-resourced operation that took consistent operational security steps to conceal their identity and location\u201d, Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook\u2019s head of cybersecurity policy, said in a blogpost. The campaign used 50 Instagram accounts and one Facebook account with about 246,000 followers to publish nearly 75,000 posts, according to Graphika, a social network analysis company that reviewed the campaign for Facebook. The accounts adopted various political identities, such as pro-Donald Trump, anti-police violence, pro-Bernie Sanders, LGBTQ, feminist, pro-police and pro-Confederate, according to Graphika\u2019s analysis. Most posts were not explicitly related to electoral politics, Graphika said, but were focused on general political commentary for \u201cpersona development and branding\u201d. The deployment of false personas advocating for both sides of a political debate \u2013 such as nine accounts designed to look like they were run by black activists protesting against police violence and \u201cthin blue line\u201d accounts defending police officers \u2013 echoes the tactics used by the IRA during its 2016 election interference campaign. The accounts primarily re-shared memes or content created by authentic American social media users, according to Graphika, such as screenshots of viral tweets or reposts of memes by the conservative group Turning Point USA. The campaign may have been recycling authentic American content in an attempt to conceal its Russian origins, Graphika suggested, though the firm still detected certain linguistic tics that suggested a foreign origin. An overreliance on pro-Confederate content referencing the 1980s American television show Dukes of Hazzard was another hint at IRA origins, according to Graphika\u2019s report. Although most of the posts were focused on polarizing political issues, some specifically addressed the 2020 election, according to Graphika. The fake \u201cblack activist\u201d accounts primarily posted in support of Sanders and against Senator Kamala Harris, with some also attacking former vice-president Joe Biden. Both the \u201cprogressive\u201d and \u201cconservative\u201d fake accounts attacked Biden. \u201cIt looked like there was a systematic focus on attacking Biden from both sides,\u201d Ben Nimmo, Graphika\u2019s director of investigations, told CNN. The other three foreign influence operations disclosed by Facebook on Monday originated from Iran. One targeted audiences in the US and in francophone north Africa with content related to Israel, Palestine and Yemen. A second focused on Latin American countries with repurposed Iranian state media articles appearing to come from local news outlets. A third small network of accounts from Iran targeted the US with content from a page called BLMNews that appears to have been masquerading as a news outlet connected to the Black Lives Matter movement. Plans for 2020 elections Also on Monday, Facebook announced several initiatives designed to prevent foreign election interference in the 2020 presidential contest. \u201cElections have changed significantly since 2016, and Facebook has changed too,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg said on a conference call with reporters. The chief executive said that the company has learned after being caught on its \u201cback foot\u201d in 2016 and was now proactively preparing for elections. The company is launching a program to help secure the accounts of elected officials and tightening its rules for disclosing who controls a page. It will also begin labelling content from state-controlled media outlets and more prominently label posts that have been rated false by its third-party factchecking program. Facebook will also ban political ads designed to suppress voter turnout, including ads that suggest voting is \u201cuseless\u201d or that recommend people not vote.

On the conference call, Zuckerberg again defended his decision on that point, saying, \u201cI just think that in a democracy people should be able to see for themselves what politicians are saying.\u201d Facebook did not immediately respond to a question from the Guardian about whether it intends to allow politicians to lie in paid advertisements in the non-democratic countries in which it operates.",

The Eurosceptic wing of his party is now backing a deal for an orderly Brexit. With 322 to 306, the Saturday vote was already close.<br><br></li> <li><strong>2)</strong> This vote closed the last legal loophole that might have led to a hard Brexit on 31 October. Some of those rebel Conservatives, independents and pro-Brexit Labour members of parliament who did not vote for Johnson on Saturday because they do not trust him may now be ready to support the new Brexit deal. Their priority is to rule out a hard Brexit, not to prevent an orderly Brexit. As a result, Johnson probably now has the numbers to pass his deal. </li> </ul> <p>Pickering adds that there\u2019s a 40% chance, in his view, that the UK parliament will not ratify Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal before 31 October. That could lead to a general election, in which the Conservative Party could campaign on leaving the EU with this deal, rather than on a no-deal ticket.</p> <p>As such, Berenberg has cut the chances of a hard Brexit from 35% to 10%, adding:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The residual risk could come into play if a) a surprise surge in support for Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit Party before or in an election were to force Johnson to disavow his own deal; or b) if the UK and EU fail to strike a deal on their future economic relations by the end of the transition period.</p> </blockquote> <p>Berenberg has also cut the probability of no Brexit to 15% from 30%, suspecting that Johnson\u2019s deal could beat Remain in any second referendum.

      "bodyText": "Late drama: the government has published the text of the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) bill, ready for some titanic clashes in the Commons this week. It\u2019s online here. Legislative experts are digging through it now. Paul Waugh of HuffPost UK has spotted some key points - including some workers rights protection: The BBC\u2019s Faisal Islam has spotted a funny twist, which means EU law would linger on after Brexit.... Bloomberg\u2019s Rob Hutton points out that MPs (and their hard-working staff) have a lot of reading to do, fast! Our Politics Live blog has full reaction: So, with the pound hovering around $1.2969, off this morning\u2019s five-month high of $1.301, it\u2019s time to shut up shop. Goodnight! GW Could this be why the government isn\u2019t keen to publish the likely economic impact of its Brexit deal? As you can see, the work (by trade expert Sam Lowe of the Centre for European Reform) suggests a free trade deal would cause severe damage to some UK service sector exports -- particularly the City.... Over in parliament.... John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has blasted chancellor Sajid Javid for refusing to release an economic assessment of the new Brexit deal. McDonnell says: \u201cFlying blind on a massive decision on the future of the economy is no way for a government to make recommendations to parliament or make legislation. It\u2019s preposterous behaviour by the chancellor and this government.\u201d Here\u2019s the full story: Here\u2019s our news story on John Bercow\u2019s refusal to allow a Brexit deal vote today, which has helped push the pound down to $1.2966 in late trading. Adam Seagrave, Head of Global Sales Trading at Saxo Bank, thinks there\u2019s a 50:50 chance of Brexit happening by the 31 October deadline: The Brexit situation is so fluid and market views are changing rapidly. GBP was initially a bit lower on Bercow\u2019s rejection announcement but has since recovered most of that move. The balance of probability is the passing of Johnson\u2019s deal either with or without a delay which is what we have seen reflected in today and last week\u2019s GBP price action. As it stands and in our opinion, the likelihood of the next event are as follows: Pass of withdrawal deal and amendments before 31st October (50%); Extension to January 31st deadline (25%) and General election including extension beyond 31st deadline (25%). The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares had closed 13 points higher at 7,163. That\u2019s a modest move, with investors cautious as they wait for Brexit developments. Back just below $1.30, sterling looks like a coiled spring, bursting to rise higher. So says Chris Towner, Director at JCRA: Boris Johnson\u2019s plan to get his meaningful vote on his deal with the EU through parliament has been thwarted by House of Commons speaker Bercow. His reasoning was that it would be repetitive and disorderly to do so. However, he did say that there is every opportunity for the government to have its way by the end of October. Sterling has been sold off from levels above 1.30 against the US dollar as Johnson\u2019s plan to get Brexit done meets yet more obstacles. This frustration will weigh on Sterling but only to the extent that we have to wait for the timing of the inevitable vote. Sterling still looks like a compressed spring waiting for good news to lurch to another level higher.\u201d Over in Frankfurt, the Bank of England\u2019s top economist is calling for more UK companies to report their gender pay gap. Andy Haldane is arguing that current disclosure rules don\u2019t cover enough companies to fix the problem. My colleague Larry Elliott explains: The UK government will need to insist that companies employing more than 30 people report their gender pay gaps if inroads are to be made into the persistent bias in wages and salaries, a senior Bank of England official has said. Andy Haldane, Threadneedle Street\u2019s chief economist, said only 40% of the private-sector workforce was covered by current legislation that obliges companies with more than 250 staff members to publish details of differences in pay between men and women doing identical jobs. Speaking at a joint Bank of England and European Central Bank conference on gender and career progression in Frankfurt, Haldane said that although the gender pay gap had shrunk in recent years, it remained close to 10%. To tackle the pay gap comprehensively,\u201d Haldane said, \u201cthere is a strong case for extending the pay reporting regime to smaller companies \u2013 say, those with 30 or more staff. Haldane also warned that little is being done to address ethnic pay gaps. More here: City traders are taking Speaker Bercow\u2019s ruling in their stride, says Naeem Aslam of Think Markets. Sterling experienced a small movement towards the downside on the initial statement by the Speaker and the liquidity for the Sterling/dollar wasn\u2019t moved much..... This confirmed that traders are patient and there is no panic in the market because the extension is widely expected. Breaking: House of Commons speaker John Bercow has refused to allow a new meaningful vote on Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal. He is citing a parliamentary rule that MPs cannot be asked to consider the same legislation twice in the same session. This has knocked the pound a little lower, back to $1.298 -- it\u2019s not a major surprise. Bercow also explained that the government can instead table the legislation for a Withdrawal Agreement act, which could lead to crunch votes on Tuesday. Our Politics Live blog has more details: Here\u2019s Sajid Javid\u2019s letter: The government is not releasing new economic forecasts of the impact of Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal. The Treasury committee had asked chancellor Sajid Javid whether previous impact assessment had been updated, to cover the new deal agreed with Brussels. Those existing assessments showed that a free trade agreement (FTA) would make the economy 4.9% smaller than staying in the EU, worse than Theresa May\u2019s deal. Javid has now replied, saying that the new deal is not comparable to that FTA scenario. But he\u2019s not releasing any new figures. Instead, Javid insists in a letter just published that agreeing the Withdrawal Agreement is \u201cself-evidently in our economic interest\u201d: It would bring an end to the damaging uncertainty and delay of the past years, and allow businesses to get on with taking decisions, including around recruitment and investment. He also points out that the details of the future free trade deal with the EU still need to be negotiated, so you can\u2019t model them yet. Javid adds that there\u2019s more to Brexit than GDP... My last point is to say that trust in democracy and bringing an end to the division that has characterised this debate over the past three years, is something that cannot be measured solely through spreadsheets or impact assessments, important though they are. Respecting the referendum and closing this chapter so we can focus on delivering growth and the public services people deserve, is the right thing to do for our country. Catherine McKinnell MP, Interim Chair of the Treasury Committee, is \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d by this lack of detail. She says: The Chancellor has acknowledged that the Government\u2019s previous economic analysis of a free trade agreement does not correspond to the agreement that the Government will now be seeking. \u201cThe Government, therefore, appears content that MPs be expected to vote blindly on its new deal. The dearth of relevant economic analysis on which MPs can decide how to vote is deeply concerning. The pound\u2019s recent rally will have hurt speculators who have bet on a no-deal Brexit. But Chris Turner and Petr Krpata of ING have spotted that the market is still substantially short on the pound -- meaning that investors are positioned for sterling to weaken. They write: Speculators are still short GBP and progress on Brexit legislation could see the pound rally to $1.32-$1.34. However, if new amendments head the way of a customs union, UK prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s fragile coalition and the GBP rally could fall apart. Trade war optimism, and hopes that a disorderly Brexit can be avoided, have lifted the US stock market. The S&amp;P 500 index has jumped 0.5% in early trading, gaining 15 points to 3,001.78. Sterling is struggling to maintain its toehold over $1.30. The pound has dropped back from this morning\u2019s five-month high, back to $1.298, and remains volatile. Traders are waiting to see whether the government will be allowed to hold a new Meaningful Vote on Boris Johnson\u2019s deal, and whether any opposition MPs manage to amend it (which could lead to the vote being pulled). Jefferies analyst Brad Bechtel explains: Current thinking is that the Speaker will likely not allow the MV4 to happen given the motion was already put forward and in his mind sort of voted on in the form of the Letwin amendment. If that is the case, then Johnson shifts to implementation and puts forward a Withdrawal Agreement Bill or WAB. The WAB would likely be attacked by remainers who will add things like a potential 2nd referendum or various other \u2018wrecking\u2019 clauses or amendments related to customs union. If the Speaker actually does move forward with MV4 then the focus will be the vote that was originally scheduled for Saturday. Bechtel also believes that a disorderly Brexit is unlikely, which should support the pound. In the end, there is still a roadmap to a Brexit with a deal on Oct 31, but it will be tricky. Odds of a no deal Brexit have diminished significantly. Given there was no deal voted for on Oct 19 the PM was forced to ask for an extension from the EU, so we\u2019ll hear more about that as well today with some talking about a potential \u2018flexible\u2019 extension to Feb 2020. Hard Brexit odds being reduced has GBP/USD well supported with a move up to 1.3000 in GBP/USD overnight. We are likely in for more turbulence this week with all of the various jockeying and decisions to be made but in the end the odds of a hard Brexit are lower, so that will keep GBP elevated but volatility also well supported. Donald Trump\u2019s economic advisor, Larry Kudlow, has just bolstered today\u2019s trade war optimism by saying \u201cthings look pretty good\u201d right now. Echoing the positive noises from China, Kudlow also hinted that the US could abandon plans to hike tariffs on Chinese imports in December, if negotiations make progress. Boris Johnson urged MPs to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d on Saturday, as he tried to win approval for his withdrawal agreement. That could be an attractive pitch, more than three years after the EU referendum. But it ignores the fact that the current deal only covers Britain\u2019s exit, not its eventual new relationship with the EU. Rupert Thompson, head of research at City firm Kingswood, says this uncertainty is a reason for caution, despite the rally in sterling and UK equities in recent days. We have not made any major adjustment to our portfolios in light of the continuing uncertainties and retain a somewhat cautious stance on UK equities. A Deal would very much just mark the end of the beginning rather than the beginning of the end. The lack of clarity over the UK\u2019s future trading relationships will surely remain a significant drag on UK growth for a long time yet, albeit less than before. That said, we have delayed reinvesting the proceeds from a European fund switch, parking the proceeds temporarily in sterling cash so as to benefit from any further rise in the pound. Clare Foges, former speechwriter for David Cameron, has written in the Times today that many voters are surprised, and alarmed, to hear that leaving the EU wouldn\u2019t be the end of the matter... Boris Johnson got a pretty warm reception from fellow EU leaders last week. There were plenty of smiles, chummy handshakes and banter with the UK PM after the new Brexit deal was agreed. That all bolstered Johnson\u2019s argument that London and Brussels have made decisive progress, so MPs should do their bit and approve the deal. But... Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit argues that the EU are mainly relieved that the question of Britain\u2019s exit could soon be over (until the discussions about a post-Brexit trade deal begin...) Hopes of a breakthrough in the US-China trade talks are also lifting markets today. China\u2019s CSI 300 index closed 0.3% higher today, and the US stock market is expected rise too. Over the weekend, China\u2019s top trade negotiator said Beijing and Washington were making progress in trade talks. Associated Press has the details: China\u2019s state-run Xinhua News Agency reported that Vice Premier Liu He told a conference in the southern city of Nanchang that the most recent trade talks with the U.S. made \u201csubstantial progress.\u201d The negotiations were \u201cbuilding a foundation for signing a phased agreement,\u201d it said. U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, agreed to hold off for now on imposing new tariffs while a deal is under discussion. Trump has said he hopes to sign a \u201cPhase 1\u201d agreement with Xi when the two meet at a summit next month in Chile. After a edgy morning\u2019s trading, the FTSE 100 is currently just 10 points higher at 7161, up 0.15%. Domestic stocks are continuing to have a good day, with car sales firm Autotrader and turnaround group Melrose Industries among the risers. Prudential is the top stock, after demerging its M&amp;G division (fund management and UK insurance). Several big multinational firms are among the top fallers, because a strong pound makes foreign earnings less valuable in sterling terms. Consumer goods firms Unilever (Marmite, Domestos and Dove) and Reckitt Benckiser (Dettol, Durex, Nurafen) are both down over 1%. Medical devices maker Smith &amp; Nephew is the biggest faller, after losing its CEO following a pay row. Namal Nawana had apparently sought more money - a US-style package - prompting S&amp;N to even consider relocating itself to America to avoid City pay rules. Nawana\u2019s successor will hardly face poverty, though -- he\u2019ll get an annual salary of \u00a31.08m, as part of a pay package of up to \u00a35.5m.... Sterling is still looking choppy, and has dropped back below the crucial $1.30 mark. The City are poised for developments in Westminster, and hints about whether Brexit could happen in 10 days time, or be delayed. The latest news is that Boris Johnson\u2019s spokesman has said the government hopes to hold a new vote on its Brexit deal today. However, it would abandon a vote (assuming the Speaker allowed it) if MPs tried to add a customs union amendment. Here\u2019s a handy breakdown of the parliamentary arithmetic ahead of a Brexit vote on Tuesday, from my colleague Peter Walker: Current projections put the vote at a dead heat. Johnson\u2019s side is boosted by 20 former Tories who now sit as independents but are supportive, and various other independents such as Brexit-minded former Labour MPs including Ian Austin and Frank Field. The key will be how many current Labour MPs the government can tempt over. On Saturday, six voted with the government against Oliver Letwin\u2019s amendment to delay approval of Johnson\u2019s deal \u2013 Kevin Barron, Ronnie Campbell, Jim Fitzpatrick, Caroline Flint, Kate Hoey and John Mann. They could all be expected to back the deal. The question is whether any more Labour MPs, particularly from leave-backing constituencies, could follow. The signs are mixed. One possibility, Gloria de Piero, has said she will instead work to support a customs union amendment. More here: Newsflash: Germany\u2019s central bank fears that its economy has kept shrinking. In its monthly report, the Bundesbank has predicted that German GDP may have contracted in the third quarter of 2019. If so, that would mean Europe\u2019s largest economy had contracted for two quarters in a row, the standard Western definition of a technical recession. The Bundesbank fears that the recent slowdown across German exporters is now hurting its domestic economy. It says: Germany\u2019s economic output could have shrunk again slightly in the third quarter of 2019. The decisive factor here is the continued downturn in the export-oriented industry.\u201d Recent data have shown that Germany\u2019s exports and manufacturing output both fell over the summer, driving down business confidence to the lowest since the eurozone debt crisis. The Bundestag sees little hope of a turnaround: \u201cEarly indicators currently provide few signs of a sustainable recovery in exports and a stabilisation of the industry. \u201cThis raises the risk that the slowdown extends to a greater extent to more domestically oriented sectors.\u201d Bloomberg has also calculated that Boris Johnson could just have enough support for his deal. But what about Labour\u2019s plan to amend the deal by adding a customs union and a second referendum to the Withdrawal Agreement Implementation Bill (WAIB) this week? Bronwen Maddox of the Institute for Government believes this would cause \u201ctrouble for the prime minister\u201d, speaking on Bloomberg TV this morning. Such an amendment would force Johnson back to Brussels for fresh negotiations, as the WAIB would no longer match the WA agreed last week (for obvious reasons, the UK and EU have to approve the same Agreement). The pound typically falls whenever a no-deal Brexit looks more likely, and rises when it doesn\u2019t. So, today\u2019s small rally reflects relief that Johnson has sent a letter seeking an Article 50 extension, while still pressing on with Brexit votes this week. But...sterling\u2019s long-term prospects will depend on how the UK economy copes with this long period of Brexit uncertainty. Ranko Berich of Monex Europe points out that business investment growth will be crucial: Julius Baer, the Swiss private bank, reckons Boris Johnson has a nearly 50% chance of getting his deal through parliament David Alexander Meier, of Julius Baer\u2019s economic research team, argues that more MPs could be persuaded to back the government now that a disorderly Brexit on 31 October now looks less likely. Saturday\u2019s events were another blow to Johnson, but the deal on 31 October is not dead yet. Johnson plans a next meaningful vote on the deal already today and hopes to pass the legislation (Withdrawal Agreement Bill) this week. Hefty debates are to be expected, as the sittings will offer the critics plenty of targets, with House Speaker Bercow once again having the potential to tip the scales by setting the agenda. The opposition could try to amend the legislation to prescribe a Customs Union with the EU or a public referendum on the deal. Meanwhile, the Scottish Nationalists are warming up for further court action against Johnson due to his unsigned letter. This week could see further ups and downs for the pound sterling as the news unfolds. However, we believe that the chances for the deal to succeed have improved almost up to 50-50, as insurance for a delay has now been doubled-up. In case of a deal later this week, Brexit would occur on 31 October, with the beginning of a transition period (all unchanged) until the end of 2020, and there would be plenty of new uncertainties as negotiations on the long-term trade regime take place. Michael Brown, senior analyst at currency firm Caxton, predicts the pound could keep rising... \u201cSterling has risen above the key $1.30 level this morning for the first time since May, as optimism that a Brexit deal will pass in the Commons continues to build. The numbers now appear to be present for a \u2018meaningful vote\u2019 on the new Brexit deal to succeed, however it remains unclear whether Speaker Bercow will permit such a vote to take place. \u201cShould a vote not take place, attention will shift towards tomorrow\u2019s vote on the 2nd reading of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill \u2013 the legislation that implements the deal in the UK. Such a vote, if passed unamended, would pave the way towards an orderly Brexit, and should see the pound continue to press higher.\u201d Sterling is also stronger against other currencies, gaining 0.15% against the euro this morning to \u20ac1.163. NEWSFLASH: The pound just hit the $1.30 mark, as the City cling onto hopes that a disorderly Brexit can be avoided. Traders are reacting to this morning\u2019s predictions that Johnson has enough parliamentary support for his Withdrawal Agreement, even though MPs declined to vote the deal through on Saturday. Berenberg\u2019s argument that an orderly Brexit is now a 75% chance has clearly found some support. Shares in banks, housebuilders, and other UK-focused companies are also pushing higher too this morning. AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould explains: \u201cThere are now renewed hopes Prime Minister Boris Johnson can get his deal through today, although there are likely to be further twists in the Brexit saga no matter what happens in Westminster later.\u201d Little by little, the pound is nudging towards the $1.30 mark against the US dollar. It\u2019s not been that high since the middle of May, but speculation that MPs could approve Johnson\u2019s deal this week is giving sterling a lift.... The pound is now trading at $1.299, having clawed back its earlier losses. The Financial Times has estimated that Boris Johnson has got enough votes to get his Brexit deal through parliament, just... FT analysis suggests Mr Johnson could now have a slender Commons majority of five for his Brexit deal. If Mr Johnson wins the second reading vote, then Brexit is back on track. The prime minister would move a \u201cprogramme motion\u201d, which MPs would vote on, to railroad the withdrawal agreement bill through the Commons in record time. If a combination of long sittings in the Commons and the House of Lords is not sufficient to enact the legislation by October 31, the EU could offer Mr Johnson a \u201ctechnical extension\u201d to Brexit \u2014 perhaps a matter of weeks \u2014 to complete the parliamentary process. More here: Brexit uncertainty is dampening the UK housing market, according to online estate agent Rightmove. October is usually a strong month for house prices, after the summer holiday lull. But this year, prices only rose by 0.6% --the weakest since October 2008 (when the financial crisis was kicking off). After a bumpy start, Sterling is continuing to creep back towards Friday\u2019s five-month highs, after its earlier slide: Neil Wilson of Markets.com says traders haven\u2019t given up hopes of a Brexit deal being approved soon: It\u2019s a massive week for the pound and for Brexit. The PM suffered a setback on Saturday and was forced to send the dreaded letter to Brussels asking for an extension, but left it unsigned and sent another (signed) missive saying delay is disaster. It looks like Boris Johnson will make another stab at winning parliamentary support for his Brexit deal. We need to see if Speaker John Bercow allows it \u2013 his record on frustrating Brexit is well known. Otherwise the government will bring forward implementation legislation quickly to drive through the bill in time so that a delay is not required. The government thinks it has the numbers for the deal in its raw form to pass. Sterling remains vulnerable to significant price swings but has yet to make any real shift off the back of the weekend\u2019s votes. Traders had anticipated a volatile open down under, but we\u2019ve not really seen anything too drastic so far. Our Politics Live blog has all the action from Westminster, as the government tries to persuade Commons speaker John Bercow to allow another Brexit vote today: Despite jitteriness about another Brexit delay, most European stock markets have risen in early trading. That reflects optimism that Britain will avoid crashing out of the EU eventually (see Berenberg\u2019s forecasts). The mid-cap FTSE 250 index has also risen - up 0.3% this morning. UK focused companies are among the risers, with Royal Mail gaining 2.2% and builders supply merchants Travis Perkins up 2%. The financial markets were closed during Saturday\u2019s historic parliamentary session on Brexit, so investors are now reacting to events. This chart shows how the pound fell sharply last night once trading resumed in Asia, dropping from nearly $1.30 to below $1.29. But it\u2019s now staging a minor recovery..... This chart shows how the pound has strengthened in the last couple of weeks, as hope of a new Brexit deal have risen: The ongoing Brexit deadlock is actually more damaging to Europe than a no-deal scenario, claims France\u2019s European Affairs Minister. Amelie de Montchalin told BFM TV this morning that the EU must not become \u201cparalysed\u201d by the ongoing uncertainty over Britain\u2019s position. \u201cWhat is certain is that we need a \u2018Yes\u2019 or a \u2018No\u2019 before October 31. We need clarity. The worst of Brexit is the uncertainty. \u201cThere cannot be a new delay without it being justified... Europe cannot be paralysed,\u201d she added. One of De Montchalin\u2019s colleagues, junior economic minister Agnes Pannier-Runacher, argues that Britain could leave the EU on 31 October, despite having requested a delay. Speaking to Sud-Radio, Pannier-Runacher said: \u201cOne cannot rule out a Brexit within 10 day\u201d [thanks to Reuters for the quotes]. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index has opened cautiously higher, up 16 points higher at 7167. UK-focused stocks such as housebuilders and banks are among the top gainers, with Taylor Wimpey up 2% and Lloyds Banking Group up 1.2%. That suggests City traders are optimistic that a no-deal Brexit will be avoided. Despite his setback on Saturday, Boris Johnson is now more likely to take Britain out of the EU with a deal. So argues German bank Berenberg, which has just slashed the chances of a disorderly Brexit - and of Brexit being cancelled. It now believes there is a 75% chance of an orderly Brexit, up from just 35% previously Kallum Pickering, Berenberg\u2019s senior economist, reckons Johnson now has enough support in parliament, for two reasons: 1) Johnson has already succeeded where his predecessor Theresa May failed. The Eurosceptic wing of his party is now backing a deal for an orderly Brexit. With 322 to 306, the Saturday vote was already close. 2) This vote closed the last legal loophole that might have led to a hard Brexit on 31 October. Some of those rebel Conservatives, independents and pro-Brexit Labour members of parliament who did not vote for Johnson on Saturday because they do not trust him may now be ready to support the new Brexit deal. Their priority is to rule out a hard Brexit, not to prevent an orderly Brexit. As a result, Johnson probably now has the numbers to pass his deal. Pickering adds that there\u2019s a 40% chance, in his view, that the UK parliament will not ratify Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal before 31 October. That could lead to a general election, in which the Conservative Party could campaign on leaving the EU with this deal, rather than on a no-deal ticket. As such, Berenberg has cut the chances of a hard Brexit from 35% to 10%, adding: The residual risk could come into play if a) a surprise surge in support for Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit Party before or in an election were to force Johnson to disavow his own deal; or b) if the UK and EU fail to strike a deal on their future economic relations by the end of the transition period. Berenberg has also cut the probability of no Brexit to 15% from 30%, suspecting that Johnson\u2019s deal could beat Remain in any second referendum. That\u2019s despite forecasts that Britain would grow faster within the EU..... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After the drama of Brexit Super Saturday, City investors are facing a Murky Monday as they ponder whether, when, and how the UK will leave the European Union. The pound is under pressure in early trading, falling back from a five-month high, after MPs forced Boris Johnson to (grudgingly) ask for a three-month extension to the 31 October deadline. Rather than vote for his new deal, parliament decided to withhold support until they\u2019ve had a chance to scrutinise full legislation on the withdrawal agreement. Having nearly hit $1.30 on Friday night, sterling has shed nearly a cent this morning, dropping back to $1.287 as traders react to this latest uncertainty. But that\u2019s still 5% higher than two weeks ago, before London and Brussels surprisingly came up with the new deal. And it could easily rally today, if Johnson makes any progress towards driving Brexit through. The government is pushing for a new Meaningful Vote today, which could show that Johnson has enough support to get his deal through. Another possibility is a vote on the Brexit legislation on Tuesday. The path ahead remains complicated.... ... but some City economist argue that the risk of a no-deal Brexit has fallen. As Elsa Lignos of Royal Bank of Canada writes: The numbers are actually shaping up in the government\u2019s favour. The Letwin amendment has paved the way for more Tory rebels to back Johnson, and having been estimated at a few votes short on Saturday, most expect the govt will reach the magic 320 tomorrow.... She argues that the pound could rally further: Though government ministers are trying to claim the risk of no deal has increased due to the Letwin amendment, bookies suggest it has done the opposite. We agree and think the kneejerk pound weakness will be bought into. But with the opposition Labour Party trying to build alliance to push for a softer Brexit than Johnson\u2019s free trade deal, there could be more volatility in the markets this week. Also coming up Germany\u2019s central bankers publish their monthly report today, outlining their view of the economic outlook in the EU\u2019s largest economy. Brexit, trade wars and the domestic slowdown may all feature, as Germany teeters on the brink of recession. Andy Haldane, the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, is speaking at a conference on \u201cGender and Career Progression\u201d in Frankfurt The agenda 11am BST: German Bundesbank publishes its monthly report 4pm BST: Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane gives a speech on diversity.",

      "bodyText": "Multimillionaire property developer Nick Candy is considering a takeover bid for Capital &amp; Counties (Capco), the FTSE-250 real estate company that owns much of Earl\u2019s Court and Covent Garden in London. Candy, 46, who developed the luxury One Hyde Park residential and retail complex in Knightsbridge with his brother, Christian, said his investment vehicle Candy Ventures was in \u201cthe early stages of considering\u201d buying all of the shares of 85-year-old Capco. Shares in Capco, which had almost halved from their 2015 peak owing to delays in developing a massive complex of luxury homes on the site of the former Earls Court exhibition centre, jumped 8% to 269p on the news of Candy\u2019s interest on Monday. At that price, Capco is valued at about \u00a32.3bn. The value of the Earls Court project, which has planning permission for 3.4m sq ft of homes and commercial space, has been repeatedly written down, because of the collapse in demand for luxury new-build homes and a bitter battle with Hammersmith and Fulham council over a lack of affordable housing. It is now valued at less than half the \u00a3800m price tag it had in 2015. In the summer, Capco announced it would split the two parts of the business into separate companies in a bid to ringfence the Earls Court problems. Capco said it noted Candy\u2019s interest, but added: \u201cAt this stage there has been no approach made to the company by Candy Ventures or any other party.\u201d At the same time, Capco said it had entered into exclusive talks with investment firm Delancey regarding a possible sale of its Earl\u2019s Court land. Delancey is the developer behind East Village, the former athletes\u2019 village at the Olympic Park, which is now a vast private rental estate. The board of Capco said the company was \u201cwell advanced\u201d in its plans to separate its Earl\u2019s Court and Covent Garden assets. \u201cThe board has full confidence in the company\u2019s strategy and management to continue to deliver significant shareholder value,\u201d Capco said. Under the Takeover Panel\u2019s \u201cput up or shut up\u201d rules, Candy Ventures must either state an intention to make an offer or back away from any deal by 18 November. James Carswell, an analyst at Peel Hunt, said: \u201cSuch an approach is as much an endorsement of Covent Garden as it is an opportunistic tilt at Earl\u2019s Court.\u201d Covent Garden is a thriving retail and restaurant district in central London and Capco\u2019s portfolio covers 79 buildings and more than 1m sq ft. At Earl\u2019s Court, the aim is to build a vast new residential, retail and office district based on a masterplan of \u201cfour new urban villages and a high street\u201d devised by architect Sir Terry Farrell. The plan includes 7,500 new homes and 3 hectares (7.5 acres) of public green space. Capco said last month there had been progress with parties interested in buying its Earl\u2019s Court assets and its board was working with selected parties for a possible sale. Last year, Capco was in talks to sell the bulk of its interests in the Earl\u2019s Court estate to Hong Kong billionaire property developer Li Ka-shing\u2019s CK Asset Holdings.",

      "body": "<p>There was one loud explosion and then six more followed. Across the city they knew that could mean only one thing: Real Sociedad had won again. A tradition from la Real\u2019s old Atotxa ground, momentarily lost after they left in 1993 but recovered at Anoeta in 2009, a single firework is set off every time the visitors score and two are lit when la Real do. That way, the theory goes, in the boats on the Bay of Biscay they always knew how their team were getting on. And although moving to a ground on the other end of town means news no longer travels so far out to sea, and while one of these days VAR is going to ruin everything, Juan Iturralde still greets every goal by dashing through the gates and down the stairs rockets in hand, ready to tell the world.</p> \n<p>This Sunday, he made the run from stadium to forecourt four times in less than an hour, heading out into the rain. A single rocket alerted to Betis\u2019s opening goal, scored by Loren Moron after 12 minutes before two announced the equaliser 10 minutes later, an own goal from Javi Garc\u00eda \u2013 a moment\u2019s doubt introduced, as always, by the brief gap between bangs. Then came four more, two marking Willian Jos\u00e9\u2019s thumping finish to put la Real into the lead on 38 and two more following Cristi\u00e1n Portu\u2019s neat finish to a lovely move on 58. Outside, they might not have been able to see the game, but they knew: after losing at Sevilla and against Getafe, a 3-1 win had taken la Real into a Champions League place ahead of Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and Sevilla on goal difference, just two points behind Madrid and three below Barcelona.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/19/la-liga-eibar-barcelona-serie-a-bundesliga\">European roundup: Real Madrid and Bayern suffer shocks, Barcelona cruise</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Only it\u2019s not really enough just to know. It never is. As the former Real Sociedad manager Juanma Lillo, born and raised in Guip\u00fazcoa, insists: \u201cWhat enriches you is the game, not the result: the result is a piece of data. The birth rate goes up. Is that enriching? No. But the process that leads to that? Now, <em>that\u2019s</em> enriching. Do you go unto a football stadium, in the last minute, <a href=\"https://www.theblizzard.co.uk/article/brain-spain\" title=\"\">look at the scoreboard and leave</a>?\u201d He\u2019s right of course, and this time especially: it\u2019s not enough just to know where la Real are, to ask if they can stay there, although they\u2019re certainly good enough, or to note that seven of the men who played on Sunday came through the youth system and the entire starting XI cost less than Madrid spent buying \u00c1lvaro Odriozola off them; the really good part is seeing them get there.</p> \n<p>Because here\u2019s the thing: Real Sociedad are the best team in Spain right now. The best to watch, anyway. Maybe even the best-best. Sunday showed that.</p> \n<p>So, in fact, might their previous two games, despite losing: defeat in Sevilla was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/30/sevilla-and-sociedads-special-show-puts-madrid-derby-in-shade\" title=\"\">most enjoyable match of the season so far</a>, and even after going down to 10 men and letting in a last-minute winner against Getafe fans went home \u201cmoderately happy\u201d, coach Imanol Alguacil said: there were, he insisted, \u201cgood vibrations\u201d. The forward Portu said: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to have no doubts when you lose, but we were the opposite: we didn\u2019t have the slightest doubt,\u201d and nor did supporters. They would be straight back for the next game a fortnight later, even on a day so miserable that the hilltop church at the Fundaci\u00f3n Zorroaga that looks down on the ground couldn\u2019t see it through the rain.</p> \n<p>This Sunday 28,032 went, which was Real Sociedad\u2019s lowest attendance this season but is still ahead of anything from last year or the year before, and not just because the stadium is bigger now but because something is building at Anoeta. Redeveloped, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/sep/17/spain-looks-north-as-real-sociedad-athletic-take-giants-to-the-wire\" title=\"\">running track gone</a>, the Aitor Zabaleta singing section at one end providing a focal point for an atmosphere which is proving contagious, the place is officially now called the Reala Arena; more importantly, it is <em>theirs</em>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sidlowe/status/1185877429627154433%E2%80%99s=20\" title=\"\">home at last</a>. An enjoyable place to be with an enjoyable team. </p> \n<p>In the build-up to Sunday\u2019s game the Betis manager, Rub\u00ed, said that la Real were the team he liked the most, playing \u201clovely\u201d football. One former Spain manager says they\u2019re the best in the country right now. This Sunday they went one down against Betis but then took Rub\u00ed\u2019s team apart with the kind of display that underlines why: fast, precise, technically impeccable at times, and relentless, the rain giving it <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sidlowe/status/1186188632119480320%E2%80%99s=20.\" title=\"\">an epic feel</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey don\u2019t run, they fly,\u201d cheered El Diario Vasco. \u201cA storm,\u201d Radio Euskadi said; \u201ca tsunami,\u201d El Mundo Deportivo called them, taking advantage of the fact that before kick-off the Ramones had rung round on the PA system while at half-time <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wc-_ClMNGs\" title=\"\">it was Gatibu</a> to declare the team \u201cpure rock and roll, [with] electricity in their veins\u201d. You could see why.</p> \n<p>\u201cEveryone goes at full pelt,\u201d Portu said. But it\u2019s more than pace; it\u2019s precision too, the clarity of roles, the commitment to attack. \u201cWe all have a specific function and we all have to do something special to hurt the opponents,\u201d Portu said. \u201cAnd we have a lot of freedom to express ourselves.\u201d</p> \n<p>This was an expression of who they are. To take just two players, the men in the middle: Mikel Merino produced a performance that was startlingly complete while just ahead of him \u2013 well, everywhere really \u2013 Martin Odegaard has probably been La Liga\u2019s best midfielder. He loves a scooped pass, a little dink, and from one of the three he played, Oyarzabal cleverly laid it off to Portu for an impeccable third goal that was Portu\u2019s first here.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b17a74c1e9f08398889f53965126df188572141e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b17a74c1e9f08398889f53965126df188572141e/0_723_5000_3001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Real Sociedad are playing a thrilling brand of football under Imanol Alguacil.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Real Sociedad are playing a thrilling brand of football under Imanol Alguacil.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Javier Etxezarreta/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t get any better,\u201d Portu said. But while this might have been la Real\u2019s best performance, it wasn\u2019t an isolated one. Sure, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/02/sport-as-song-and-song-as-sport-a-night-at-the-basque-derby-athletic-bilbao-real-sociedad-la-liga-sid-lowe\" title=\"\">they lost against Athletic</a>, but this is the team who took Atl\u00e9tico apart, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/30/sevilla-and-sociedads-special-show-puts-madrid-derby-in-shade?CMP=share_btn_tw\" title=\"\">took on Sevilla</a>, the two trading blows, and were unlucky to lose against Getafe. A team who know exactly what they\u2019re doing.</p> \n<p>\u201cAfter Getafe people said that maybe if we had been more conservative we might have got the points but no, not here: you have to go for them. And we win a lot of games because of that ambition to get goals,\u201d Portu said.</p> \n<p>Alguacil said: \u201cThe idea is clear: we will not wait, we won\u2019t hedge our bets, we will always go for them, try to score as many goals as we can \u2013 and as long as I am sitting here, that will be the case.\u201d And as long as he is sitting there, fans will sit in the stands.</p> \n<p>\u201cFun,\u201d El Pa\u00eds called them this morning. It\u2019s a simple word, but it might be the most important, the one that best defines them. Maybe it\u2019s because this is a young team \u2013 Merino and Le Normand were born in 1996; Zubeld\u00eda, Guevara and Oyarzabal in 97; Odegaard in 98 \u2013 but there\u2019s something about the way they play that\u2019s contagious. There\u2019s dynamism, determination. \u201cYou should see us training; if you did, you\u2019d understand a lot,\u201d Portu said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s full on. No one relaxes ever, not even on a Monday, when it\u2019s our day off.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/17/la-liga-miami-villarreal-atletico-madrid-regular-season-game\">La Liga lines up Miami to host Villarreal v Atl\u00e9tico in regular-season game</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>That\u2019s not just duty. There has to be enjoyment and that relentlessness speaks of an enthusiasm, an urgency that\u2019s clear in Real Sociedad\u2019s play.

      "bodyText": "There was one loud explosion and then six more followed. Across the city they knew that could mean only one thing: Real Sociedad had won again. A tradition from la Real\u2019s old Atotxa ground, momentarily lost after they left in 1993 but recovered at Anoeta in 2009, a single firework is set off every time the visitors score and two are lit when la Real do. That way, the theory goes, in the boats on the Bay of Biscay they always knew how their team were getting on. And although moving to a ground on the other end of town means news no longer travels so far out to sea, and while one of these days VAR is going to ruin everything, Juan Iturralde still greets every goal by dashing through the gates and down the stairs rockets in hand, ready to tell the world. This Sunday, he made the run from stadium to forecourt four times in less than an hour, heading out into the rain. A single rocket alerted to Betis\u2019s opening goal, scored by Loren Moron after 12 minutes before two announced the equaliser 10 minutes later, an own goal from Javi Garc\u00eda \u2013 a moment\u2019s doubt introduced, as always, by the brief gap between bangs. Then came four more, two marking Willian Jos\u00e9\u2019s thumping finish to put la Real into the lead on 38 and two more following Cristi\u00e1n Portu\u2019s neat finish to a lovely move on 58. Outside, they might not have been able to see the game, but they knew: after losing at Sevilla and against Getafe, a 3-1 win had taken la Real into a Champions League place ahead of Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and Sevilla on goal difference, just two points behind Madrid and three below Barcelona. Only it\u2019s not really enough just to know. It never is. As the former Real Sociedad manager Juanma Lillo, born and raised in Guip\u00fazcoa, insists: \u201cWhat enriches you is the game, not the result: the result is a piece of data. The birth rate goes up. Is that enriching? No. But the process that leads to that? Now, that\u2019s enriching. Do you go unto a football stadium, in the last minute, look at the scoreboard and leave?\u201d He\u2019s right of course, and this time especially: it\u2019s not enough just to know where la Real are, to ask if they can stay there, although they\u2019re certainly good enough, or to note that seven of the men who played on Sunday came through the youth system and the entire starting XI cost less than Madrid spent buying \u00c1lvaro Odriozola off them; the really good part is seeing them get there. Because here\u2019s the thing: Real Sociedad are the best team in Spain right now. The best to watch, anyway. Maybe even the best-best. Sunday showed that. So, in fact, might their previous two games, despite losing: defeat in Sevilla was the most enjoyable match of the season so far, and even after going down to 10 men and letting in a last-minute winner against Getafe fans went home \u201cmoderately happy\u201d, coach Imanol Alguacil said: there were, he insisted, \u201cgood vibrations\u201d. The forward Portu said: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to have no doubts when you lose, but we were the opposite: we didn\u2019t have the slightest doubt,\u201d and nor did supporters. They would be straight back for the next game a fortnight later, even on a day so miserable that the hilltop church at the Fundaci\u00f3n Zorroaga that looks down on the ground couldn\u2019t see it through the rain. This Sunday 28,032 went, which was Real Sociedad\u2019s lowest attendance this season but is still ahead of anything from last year or the year before, and not just because the stadium is bigger now but because something is building at Anoeta. Redeveloped, running track gone, the Aitor Zabaleta singing section at one end providing a focal point for an atmosphere which is proving contagious, the place is officially now called the Reala Arena; more importantly, it is theirs, home at last. An enjoyable place to be with an enjoyable team. In the build-up to Sunday\u2019s game the Betis manager, Rub\u00ed, said that la Real were the team he liked the most, playing \u201clovely\u201d football. One former Spain manager says they\u2019re the best in the country right now. This Sunday they went one down against Betis but then took Rub\u00ed\u2019s team apart with the kind of display that underlines why: fast, precise, technically impeccable at times, and relentless, the rain giving it an epic feel. \u201cThey don\u2019t run, they fly,\u201d cheered El Diario Vasco. \u201cA storm,\u201d Radio Euskadi said; \u201ca tsunami,\u201d El Mundo Deportivo called them, taking advantage of the fact that before kick-off the Ramones had rung round on the PA system while at half-time it was Gatibu to declare the team \u201cpure rock and roll, [with] electricity in their veins\u201d. You could see why. \u201cEveryone goes at full pelt,\u201d Portu said. But it\u2019s more than pace; it\u2019s precision too, the clarity of roles, the commitment to attack. \u201cWe all have a specific function and we all have to do something special to hurt the opponents,\u201d Portu said. \u201cAnd we have a lot of freedom to express ourselves.\u201d This was an expression of who they are. To take just two players, the men in the middle: Mikel Merino produced a performance that was startlingly complete while just ahead of him \u2013 well, everywhere really \u2013 Martin Odegaard has probably been La Liga\u2019s best midfielder. He loves a scooped pass, a little dink, and from one of the three he played, Oyarzabal cleverly laid it off to Portu for an impeccable third goal that was Portu\u2019s first here. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t get any better,\u201d Portu said. But while this might have been la Real\u2019s best performance, it wasn\u2019t an isolated one. Sure, they lost against Athletic, but this is the team who took Atl\u00e9tico apart, took on Sevilla, the two trading blows, and were unlucky to lose against Getafe. A team who know exactly what they\u2019re doing. \u201cAfter Getafe people said that maybe if we had been more conservative we might have got the points but no, not here: you have to go for them. And we win a lot of games because of that ambition to get goals,\u201d Portu said. Alguacil said: \u201cThe idea is clear: we will not wait, we won\u2019t hedge our bets, we will always go for them, try to score as many goals as we can \u2013 and as long as I am sitting here, that will be the case.\u201d And as long as he is sitting there, fans will sit in the stands. \u201cFun,\u201d El Pa\u00eds called them this morning. It\u2019s a simple word, but it might be the most important, the one that best defines them. Maybe it\u2019s because this is a young team \u2013 Merino and Le Normand were born in 1996; Zubeld\u00eda, Guevara and Oyarzabal in 97; Odegaard in 98 \u2013 but there\u2019s something about the way they play that\u2019s contagious. There\u2019s dynamism, determination. \u201cYou should see us training; if you did, you\u2019d understand a lot,\u201d Portu said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s full on. No one relaxes ever, not even on a Monday, when it\u2019s our day off.\u201d That\u2019s not just duty. There has to be enjoyment and that relentlessness speaks of an enthusiasm, an urgency that\u2019s clear in Real Sociedad\u2019s play. Every time they\u2019re knocked down, they\u2019re up again taking the free-kick immediately; every throw-in is taken fast, rushing to get every ball; even the ball-boys move quick. It\u2019s part of a plan of course, but it feels like at some level it\u2019s simpler than that: as if they just want a game, like they can\u2019t bare the idea of wasting a moment. If there\u2019s one thing more fun than watching la Real, it\u2019s playing for them \u2013 and that\u2019s precisely what makes them so good to watch. \u201cBeing on the pitch is a joy,\u201d Portu said. Being at the ground is a joy too, down where goals go in and fireworks go off. Talking points \u2022 There was no Bale, no Modric, no Kroos, and no Hazard, \u20ac268m worth of players missing, but the team Madrid put out there still cost \u20ac463.4m.

She didn\u2019t design the idiotic uncapped incentive scheme and, by the time she became chair of the remuneration committee in December 2017, the damage had been done. She was, though, obliged to appear in front of MPs on the business select committee in June last year to try to defend the bonanza and, in that capacity, she provided a textbook example of how not to prepare for a session in front of MPs.</p> \n<p>Fairburn himself would probably have bet his bonus on this question cropping up: what\u2019s the average pay at Persimmon? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/06/persimmon-pay-panel-chief-unable-to-tell-mps-firms-average-pay\">Sears didn\u2019t know</a> or, rather, hadn\u2019t looked up the figure in advance. Cue incredulity on the part of MPs and an easy clip for the evening TV news to confirm the impression of directors living in a bubble.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s astonishing how often corporate types fail to anticipate the bleedin\u2019 obvious. Peter Fankhauser, the man on the bridge when Thomas Cook sank, flapped ineffectually last week when asked if he would be paying back any of his bonuses.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5c304d94-202d-42a4-bc1b-a6569a95dc54\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Brexit</b><br>\u201cThere is now little doubt that the Brexit process has led many UK customers to delay their holiday plans for this summer,\u201d said the chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, in May. But it cannot be the whole story - arch-rival Tui has coped because its finances are healthier.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Weather</b><br>The summer heatwave of 2018 encouraged would-be holidaymakers to stay at home, undermining prices in the \u201clates\u201d market where operators try to clear unsold holidays. There seems to have been a hangover into 2019, with customers calculating that waiting to book is a productive strategy.</p>\n    <p><b>Competition</b><br>A pincer movement of Airbnb and budget holidays has changed consumer behaviour, though Thomas Cook still managed to sell 11m package holidays last year.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Banks and debt</b><br>The tour operator has been attempting to shoulder a&nbsp; huge pile of debt for the past decade \u2013 \u00a31.7bn worth at the last count. Successive managements failed to remove meaningful chunks. The banks argue they have supported an overstretched company for years and the details of why it could not be saved may have to await the report from the Insolvency Service.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Bad management</b><br>Thomas Cook\u2019s borrowings were too high. The moral of the tale is that tour operators should fund themselves conservatively. If your balance sheet is fragile, you are at the mercy of events in an industry where most of the cash arrives in the summer and then flows out in the winter.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/nilspratley\"><b>Nils Pratley</b></a>, financial editor</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>At least Manny Fontenla-Novoa, Fankhauser\u2019s predecessor and an upcoming witness on Wednesday, cannot enter the same \u201cI\u2019ll think about it\u201d plea. He earned \u00a317m in eight years and left in 2011 when the tour operator was on the brink of collapse the first time. He\u2019s had plenty of time to think, and ample warning.</p> \n<h2>Gender pay reporting should include SMEs</h2> \n<p>Andy Haldane, the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, makes a fair point. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/21/small-firms-need-to-report-gender-pay-gaps-says-bank-chief-economist\">Gender pay reporting should be extended to companies employing more than 30 people</a>, instead of being confined to those with more than 250 staff.</p> \n<p>Small and mid-sized companies may groan at the idea of more bureaucracy, but they shouldn\u2019t. First, crunching the numbers isn\u2019t difficult. Second, if the overall data is to be useful to policymakers, it should be comprehensive. Haldane estimates that the current reporting requirement covers only 40% of the UK working population in the private sector. Third, self-examination is worthwhile: why wouldn\u2019t you want to know your own pay gap?</p>",

Actually, he must have realised because he made a point in interviews of mentioning how he had taken a pay cut to join. Or perhaps he thought Smith &amp; Nephew itself would be heading to the US via a relisting, with a remuneration rethink to follow along local lines. A corporate switch has been rumoured but Nawana would have been unwise to bet on it happening. Even mighty Unilever couldn\u2019t persuade its shareholders to accept a re-domicile to the Netherlands. One is left to assume that Nawana, after injecting some life into Smith &amp; Nephew\u2019s share price, had gambled that he could bounce the board. If so, chairman Roberto Quarta (perhaps bruised by his annual showdowns over pay at WPP in the Sir Martin Sorrell era) deserves some credit for standing firm. Nawana was on a base salary of $1.5m, with the chance to earn an estimated annual maximum of about $7m for hitting targets. If that\u2019s not sufficient motivation to get out of bed in the morning, don\u2019t take the job in the first place. How corporate types fail to anticipate the bleedin\u2019 obvious Still on remuneration matters, it\u2019s farewell to Marion Sears, chair of the pay committee at Persimmon, the housebuilder that caused uproar when it shovelled a \u00a375m bonus in the direction of chief executive Jeff Fairburn, now thankfully departed. Sears\u2019 role in the Fairburn fiasco was actually minor. She didn\u2019t design the idiotic uncapped incentive scheme and, by the time she became chair of the remuneration committee in December 2017, the damage had been done. She was, though, obliged to appear in front of MPs on the business select committee in June last year to try to defend the bonanza and, in that capacity, she provided a textbook example of how not to prepare for a session in front of MPs. Fairburn himself would probably have bet his bonus on this question cropping up: what\u2019s the average pay at Persimmon? Sears didn\u2019t know or, rather, hadn\u2019t looked up the figure in advance. Cue incredulity on the part of MPs and an easy clip for the evening TV news to confirm the impression of directors living in a bubble. It\u2019s astonishing how often corporate types fail to anticipate the bleedin\u2019 obvious. Peter Fankhauser, the man on the bridge when Thomas Cook sank, flapped ineffectually last week when asked if he would be paying back any of his bonuses. At least Manny Fontenla-Novoa, Fankhauser\u2019s predecessor and an upcoming witness on Wednesday, cannot enter the same \u201cI\u2019ll think about it\u201d plea. He earned \u00a317m in eight years and left in 2011 when the tour operator was on the brink of collapse the first time. He\u2019s had plenty of time to think, and ample warning. Gender pay reporting should include SMEs Andy Haldane, the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, makes a fair point. Gender pay reporting should be extended to companies employing more than 30 people, instead of being confined to those with more than 250 staff. Small and mid-sized companies may groan at the idea of more bureaucracy, but they shouldn\u2019t. First, crunching the numbers isn\u2019t difficult. Second, if the overall data is to be useful to policymakers, it should be comprehensive. Haldane estimates that the current reporting requirement covers only 40% of the UK working population in the private sector. Third, self-examination is worthwhile: why wouldn\u2019t you want to know your own pay gap?",

There cannot be a new delay without it being justified.\u201d David Sassoli, the European parliament\u2019s president, said the EU chamber would \u201cbe the final actor to have its say in this matter\u201d. On Saturday, the Commons voted to withhold its approval until all the legislation relating to the withdrawal agreement bill has been passed. The prime minister subsequently complied with the Benn act by sending three letters on Saturday evening to ask the EU to provide for a delay beyond 31 October. Alongside an unsigned photocopy of the request he was obliged to send under the act, there was an explanatory letter from the UK\u2019s ambassador to the EU, Sir Tim Barrow, and a personal letter from Boris Johnson explaining why Downing Street thought a further delay would be corrosive. A spokeswoman for the European commission said the request had been formally received, despite its unconventional \u201cform\u201d. The spokeswoman added the EU\u2019s ratification processes had been launched in preparation for approval by the Commons but that it was up to London to take the next steps. \u201cThe request to extend article 50 was made by the UK\u2019s permanent representative to the EU,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cPresident Tusk acknowledged receipt of the request on Saturday and stated that he was now consulting with the EU27, so this form does not change anything.\u201d Speaking to the German radio station Deutschlandfunk, Altmaier said the onus was on Downing Street to provide clarity on the next steps as soon as possible for Brexit to be possible on 31 October. \u201cWhat we need is clarity and we need it quickly,\u201d Altmaier said. \u201cIn recent months we have repeatedly taken into account the difficult situation in the UK. At the moment, the hardest part is that we do not know who actually speaks for this country: is it the government or is it the elected parliament? Both represent different positions. \u201cThe government would like to quit on 31 October; parliament has requested a delay. This is a very difficult topic now. We will talk about this with our European partners.\u201d",

It casts Britain out of the customs union, creating borders almost as hard \u2013 and with ports almost as blocked \u2013 as under a no-deal exit. But it keeps Northern Ireland in the customs union, splitting it off from the rest of the UK, fraying the bonds with hard-bordered Britain. Perversely, Johnson powers up separatists by denying Scotland\u2019s similar wish to stay in the customs union. Any Labour MPs schmoozed by Johnson\u2019s bogus reassurances will surely be alarmed at how he has shifted EU alignment on climate, food and employment standards \u2013 from legally binding to mere vague intent.</p> \n<p>Any Labour MPs or Tory remainer/soft Brexiteers who rejected May\u2019s deal need to say which of these magic new ingredients could possibly sway them now. The European Research Group folds because it gets most of its demands. But I find it hard to believe that any Labour MPs, beyond the usual few mavericks, will slide into the lobby to vote this week with the Johnsonites. On Saturday there were just six \u2013 five of whom are not standing again, plus Caroline Flint who takes over the Kate Hoey rank-outsider role on the furthest backbench. How many want to join her in that isolated slot?</p> \n<p>At a rally in Liverpool on Saturday night, Jeremy Corbyn said: \u201cThose who voted leave or remain have all got a place in the Labour party.\u201d It\u2019s unclear if that was a blanket pardon to his own MPs, but he would be right not to expel them. (And in that spirit, he should suspend destructive trigger ballots currently wasting the energies of Labour MPs who should be out canvassing, not wooing their own members.) Expulsions made Johnson look weak and petulant when he threw out dissidents far more distinguished than he. Party allegiances are deep and broad: no need to purge dissenters even on this most epoch-shaping issue.</p> \n<p>My guess is that most potential Labour rebels will stop at the brink. Ahead lies the danger that win, lose or withdraw the bill due to obnoxious amendments, the outcome will be win-win for Johnson. Either way, he can bounce into an imminent election triumphant at passing his deal, or he can blast parliament and opposition to hell and damnation as blockers of the people\u2019s will.</p> \n<p>Let\u2019s suppose he wins a majority to wreak his will on the country for five unconscionable years. Imagine he deregulates to meet US, Indian and Chinese standards and yet fails to secure significant new trade. The car industry will be gone within a decade, new models moved abroad; food and fish processing ditto. The economy sinks below countries once our equals, while the brain-drain steals our children and foreign talent. The state shrinks despite a few crowd-pleasers to stop the most visible services collapsing. The climate worsens and Britain lags behind EU initiatives.</p> \n<p>Labour MPs who help Johnson to victory, by backing his Brexit to satisfy their constituents, will find themselves unforgiven even if not expelled. Each Johnson act that passes, each budget turn of the screw, will belong to them in perpetuity, no way back. </p> \n<p>Flint rightly says Labour MPs who take that course will be \u201cbrave\u201d. If they were, like Hoey, actual Brexit believers, that might be so. But those such as Flint, who think democracy commands that they must obey their leave constituents\u2019 wishes, look a bit less brave than other leave-constituency MPs such as Sunderland South\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/02/constituency-voted-leave-labour-oppose-brexit-sunderland\" title=\"\">Bridget Phillipson</a>, Redcar\u2019s Anna Turley or Wakefield\u2019s Mary Creagh, who vote against leaving the EU while warning their leave voters of Brexit harm.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"16661a61-0e0a-4275-86d6-8fa8192c8626\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/A5auvTNciK8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>What if constituents backed the home secretary, Priti Patel, in some future restoration of capital punishment, say, or banishment of foreigners, would Flint-minded Labour MPs obey their orders in the mistaken idea that democracy demands they follow not lead their voters?</p> \n<p>Come the hour, as they inspect the withdrawal agreement bill\u2019s details, I doubt many Labour MPs will vote for Johnson\u2019s enthronement. Instead, across the House, enough MPs may vote to stay in the customs union with a public vote to confirm it.</p> \n<p>This hard-as-nails Brexit has just one intent: to knock out Nigel Farage, Johnson\u2019s most feared opponent, in a bare-knuckle fight. No chance, as Farage will out-Brexit him every time: \u201cBrexit in name only\u201d, \u201cno vote, no voice, no veto\u201d and \u201cclean break is the only way\u201d is his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFsFzuuUtXw\" title=\"\">TV studio challenge</a>. This man, who has seven times failed to be elected MP, has nonetheless shaped every step of the country\u2019s disastrous path out of Europe. </p> \n<p>Labour\u2019s best chance of stopping a Johnson election victory depends on this old monster scything away a heap of Tory leave votes: Brexit certainly makes odd bedfellows. But I doubt many Labour MPs will make their bed with Johnson in this week\u2019s votes.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Perversely, Johnson powers up separatists by denying Scotland\u2019s similar wish to stay in the customs union. Any Labour MPs schmoozed by Johnson\u2019s bogus reassurances will surely be alarmed at how he has shifted EU alignment on climate, food and employment standards \u2013 from legally binding to mere vague intent. Any Labour MPs or Tory remainer/soft Brexiteers who rejected May\u2019s deal need to say which of these magic new ingredients could possibly sway them now. The European Research Group folds because it gets most of its demands. But I find it hard to believe that any Labour MPs, beyond the usual few mavericks, will slide into the lobby to vote this week with the Johnsonites. On Saturday there were just six \u2013 five of whom are not standing again, plus Caroline Flint who takes over the Kate Hoey rank-outsider role on the furthest backbench. How many want to join her in that isolated slot? At a rally in Liverpool on Saturday night, Jeremy Corbyn said: \u201cThose who voted leave or remain have all got a place in the Labour party.\u201d It\u2019s unclear if that was a blanket pardon to his own MPs, but he would be right not to expel them. (And in that spirit, he should suspend destructive trigger ballots currently wasting the energies of Labour MPs who should be out canvassing, not wooing their own members.) Expulsions made Johnson look weak and petulant when he threw out dissidents far more distinguished than he. Party allegiances are deep and broad: no need to purge dissenters even on this most epoch-shaping issue. My guess is that most potential Labour rebels will stop at the brink. Ahead lies the danger that win, lose or withdraw the bill due to obnoxious amendments, the outcome will be win-win for Johnson. Either way, he can bounce into an imminent election triumphant at passing his deal, or he can blast parliament and opposition to hell and damnation as blockers of the people\u2019s will. Let\u2019s suppose he wins a majority to wreak his will on the country for five unconscionable years. Imagine he deregulates to meet US, Indian and Chinese standards and yet fails to secure significant new trade. The car industry will be gone within a decade, new models moved abroad; food and fish processing ditto. The economy sinks below countries once our equals, while the brain-drain steals our children and foreign talent. The state shrinks despite a few crowd-pleasers to stop the most visible services collapsing. The climate worsens and Britain lags behind EU initiatives. Labour MPs who help Johnson to victory, by backing his Brexit to satisfy their constituents, will find themselves unforgiven even if not expelled. Each Johnson act that passes, each budget turn of the screw, will belong to them in perpetuity, no way back. Flint rightly says Labour MPs who take that course will be \u201cbrave\u201d. If they were, like Hoey, actual Brexit believers, that might be so. But those such as Flint, who think democracy commands that they must obey their leave constituents\u2019 wishes, look a bit less brave than other leave-constituency MPs such as Sunderland South\u2019s Bridget Phillipson, Redcar\u2019s Anna Turley or Wakefield\u2019s Mary Creagh, who vote against leaving the EU while warning their leave voters of Brexit harm. What if constituents backed the home secretary, Priti Patel, in some future restoration of capital punishment, say, or banishment of foreigners, would Flint-minded Labour MPs obey their orders in the mistaken idea that democracy demands they follow not lead their voters? Come the hour, as they inspect the withdrawal agreement bill\u2019s details, I doubt many Labour MPs will vote for Johnson\u2019s enthronement. Instead, across the House, enough MPs may vote to stay in the customs union with a public vote to confirm it. This hard-as-nails Brexit has just one intent: to knock out Nigel Farage, Johnson\u2019s most feared opponent, in a bare-knuckle fight. No chance, as Farage will out-Brexit him every time: \u201cBrexit in name only\u201d, \u201cno vote, no voice, no veto\u201d and \u201cclean break is the only way\u201d is his TV studio challenge. This man, who has seven times failed to be elected MP, has nonetheless shaped every step of the country\u2019s disastrous path out of Europe. Labour\u2019s best chance of stopping a Johnson election victory depends on this old monster scything away a heap of Tory leave votes: Brexit certainly makes odd bedfellows. But I doubt many Labour MPs will make their bed with Johnson in this week\u2019s votes. \u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist",

Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s longest-serving leader, made the announcement just two days before the deadline to return the mandate to the president, Reuven Rivlin, who in turn intends to task Gantz, the head of the opposition, with the job of putting together a new government. It would be the first time in over a decade that anyone but Netanyahu would be given the chance to head the Israeli government. But the move does not necessarily end Netanyahu\u2019s political career, nor his chances of leading the country\u2019s next administration. Once he is formally asked by the president, Gantz will have 28 days to attempt to forge a coalition, or risk another election being called. \u201cThe time of spin is over, and it is now time for action,\u201d Gantz\u2019s party said in response to the news, adding that it was \u201cdetermined to form the liberal unity government, led by Benny Gantz, that the people of Israel voted for a month ago\u201d. Gantz\u2019s chances do not look good and many in Israel predict he will also fail. Netanyahu was awarded the first shot at forming a government as he had marginally more support from lawmakers than Gantz. Neither leader, however, has a clear majority of 61 seats in the 120-seat Knesset and both have sought to stall each other\u2019s dash for power. It is possible that if Gantz also fails, another parliamentarian could take the mandate, although they would need support from a majority of lawmakers, a position that currently appears extremely unlikely. If Israelis go to the polls again it would be the third time in a year, after two inconclusive election results pushed the country into a political crisis. In May Netanyahu failed to cobble together a coalition following April\u2019s muddied election result. Rather than giving the opposition a chance to forge a government, he instead pushed to dissolve the Knesset, triggering repeat elections and giving himself another chance. Rivlin has been pressuring the two main parties to put aside their differences and form a unity government as together they would have more than enough seats for a majority. In his statement Netanyahu said he had \u201cmade every effort to bring Benny Gantz to the negotiating table. Every effort to establish a broad national unity government, every effort to prevent another election. \u201cTo my regret, time after time he declined. He simply refused.\u201d Gantz ran his election campaign on the promise to topple Netanyahu, making it difficult for the opposition leader to accept a power-sharing deal without losing credibility. Meanwhile, the prime minister has insisted his traditional allies from hardline nationalists to religious parties be included in any unity government, a precondition Gantz has rejected. The next few weeks are not only crucial for Netanyahu\u2019s political life, but also possibly his freedom. Israel\u2019s attorney general is currently deciding whether to indict him in three potential corruption cases. If he retains the role of prime minister, he will not be required to step down, even if indicted. Netanyahu has denied all allegations.",

An Asda spokesperson said: \u201cWe have been clear that we don\u2019t want any of our colleagues to leave us and while the vast majority of colleagues have chosen to sign the new contract, we continue to have conversations with those who have chosen not to, to try to understand their concerns. \u201cIt is vital that we make sure we are prepared to adapt to the demands of our market. Change is never easy but we are determined that Asda remains a sustainable business for its customers and colleagues \u2013 now and in the future.\u201d Asda\u2019s contract change reflects similar alterations at rival supermarkets, which have offset increases in basic wages \u2013 partly driven by the annual increase in the legal minimum wage \u2013 by removing other perks. Competition for workers, amid high-profile efforts by the fast-growing grocery discounters Aldi and Lidl to pay more than the legal minimum, have prompted traditional supermarkets to increase their basic pay. Sainsbury\u2019s eliminated paid breaks but increased the base level of pay last year. Tesco ditched its annual bonus but pledged to increase hourly pay over the next two years to \u00a39.30, up from \u00a38.40.",

Thatcher\u2019s Spy, the memoirs of Willie Carlin, who spent 11 years as an informant in the republican movement, contains claims about how the security service tried to redirect the Provisional IRA away from violence and down the road towards political engagement in the mid-1980s. Carlin\u2019s reminiscences provide an extraordinary insight into the life of an agent in Derry, constantly fearing exposure and death at the hands of the IRA\u2019s \u201cNutting Squad\u201d. The trial that was supposedly sabotaged was heard by Northern Ireland\u2019s then lord chief justice, Lord Lowry.

The rounding up of activists had begun in 1982 and many of the 35 suspects who were eventually charged spent two years on remand in prison awaiting trial. The prosecution evidence depended almost exclusively on the word of Gilmour, who had been a volunteer in both the INLA and IRA.

Martin McGuinness, the IRA leader in Derry, supported the path of greater political engagement. In 1984, the expectation was that the trial \u2013 presided over by Lowry who was sitting in a Diplock court without a jury \u2013 would result in mass convictions.

Before Javid\u2019s first budget next month, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said low rates of capital gains tax on business income did not encourage companies to invest more in the country but did provide large savings for company owners. The IFS said entrepreneurs\u2019 relief cost the government about \u00a32.4bn a year in lost income and was not working as intended.

Javid suggested ending the uncertainty that has surrounded the issue of Brexit would in itself be beneficial to the economy \u2013 and rejected the idea that the government should carry out a new analysis and then make it available to MPs.</p> <p>\u201cMy starting point is that agreeing the withdrawal agreement is self-evidently in our economic interest,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would bring an end to the damaging uncertainty and delay of the past years and allow businesses to get on with taking decisions, including around recruitment and investment.\u201d</p> <p>The cross-Whitehall economic analysis published last year suggested the economy would be considerably weaker under a free trade agreement (FTA) \u2013 the type of relationship targeted under Boris Johnson\u2019s latest deal.</p> <p>But Javid said those forecasts only considered a \u201cgeneric, \u2018average\u2019, FTA, looking at examples from around the world\u201d. He suggested the shape of the UK\u2019s FTA with the EU would only become clear during the course of the negotiations, once Brexit had happened.</p> <p>John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: \u201cFlying blind on a massive decision on the future of the economy is no way for a government to make recommendations to parliament or make legislation. It\u2019s preposterous behaviour by the chancellor and this government.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://ukandeu.ac.uk/johnsons-brexit-leaves-uk-economy-worse-off-than-mays/\">Independent analysis</a> by the UK in a Changing Europe thinktank suggested Johnson\u2019s plan would knock between 2.3% to 7% off GDP over the next decade, compared with remaining in the EU. The equivalent estimates for Theresa May\u2019s deal were 1.9% to 5.5%.</p> <p>But in stark contrast to the cautious stance associated with his predecessor Philip Hammond, who was referred to by colleagues as \u201cSpreadsheet Phil\u201d, Javid played down the importance of economic forecasts for judging the value of the Brexit deal.</p> <p>\u201cTrust in democracy, and bringing an end to the division that has characterised this debate over the past three years, is something that cannot be measured solely through spreadsheets or impact assessments, important though they are,\u201d he wrote. \u201cRespecting the referendum and closing this chapter so we can focus on delivering growth, and the public services people deserve, is the right thing to do for our country.\u201d</p> <p>Anand Menon, the director of UK in a Changing Europe, said: \u201cIt is a shame that the chancellor seems to feel that evidence is now superfluous to good policy making. Self evidently there is more at stake here than just economics. That being said, surely we deserve to know the different potential implications of different kinds of Brexit?\u201d</p> <p>Torsten Bell, the director of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said: \u201cThe chancellor is right to say lots of other things will affect what the economic outcome for Britain is. But what is true is that every major study done inside or outside government shows that a looser relationship with the EU, as envisaged in this agreement, leads to a smaller economy than it would otherwise be.\u201d</p> <p>The full text of the withdrawal agreement bill, which the government hopes to rush through parliament in order to leave the EU on 31 October, is expected to be published on Monday evening.</p> <p>Javid is due to hold a budget on 6 November, if Brexit goes ahead next week, and the independent Office for Budget Responsibility will then present updated economic forecasts, though it is unclear whether they have enough time to analyse the details of the Johnson deal.</p> <p>In the Commons, Labour\u2019s Ian Murray said he was unable to answer his constituents who ask about the impact Johnson\u2019s deal would have on their finances because the Government is \u201crefusing to publish an economic impact assessment\u201d. </p> <p>Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay replied: \u201cThe answer is to listen to the Bank of England governor who says that getting this deal passed will be a boost to our economy.\u201d </p> <p>Catherine McKinnell, Labour MP for Newcastle upon Tyne North, said MPs were being \u201cleft in the dark\u201d about the economic impact of the new Brexit deal. </p> <p>Responding, Barclay said: \u201cThe reality is that any modelling for the future would have to take on board what is the future direction of the (EU) Commission under the new leadership, it would have to consider what actions the UK Government would take in response.\u201d <br></p>",

Javid suggested ending the uncertainty that has surrounded the issue of Brexit would in itself be beneficial to the economy \u2013 and rejected the idea that the government should carry out a new analysis and then make it available to MPs. \u201cMy starting point is that agreeing the withdrawal agreement is self-evidently in our economic interest,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would bring an end to the damaging uncertainty and delay of the past years and allow businesses to get on with taking decisions, including around recruitment and investment.\u201d The cross-Whitehall economic analysis published last year suggested the economy would be considerably weaker under a free trade agreement (FTA) \u2013 the type of relationship targeted under Boris Johnson\u2019s latest deal. But Javid said those forecasts only considered a \u201cgeneric, \u2018average\u2019, FTA, looking at examples from around the world\u201d. He suggested the shape of the UK\u2019s FTA with the EU would only become clear during the course of the negotiations, once Brexit had happened. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: \u201cFlying blind on a massive decision on the future of the economy is no way for a government to make recommendations to parliament or make legislation. It\u2019s preposterous behaviour by the chancellor and this government.\u201d Independent analysis by the UK in a Changing Europe thinktank suggested Johnson\u2019s plan would knock between 2.3% to 7% off GDP over the next decade, compared with remaining in the EU. The equivalent estimates for Theresa May\u2019s deal were 1.9% to 5.5%. But in stark contrast to the cautious stance associated with his predecessor Philip Hammond, who was referred to by colleagues as \u201cSpreadsheet Phil\u201d, Javid played down the importance of economic forecasts for judging the value of the Brexit deal. \u201cTrust in democracy, and bringing an end to the division that has characterised this debate over the past three years, is something that cannot be measured solely through spreadsheets or impact assessments, important though they are,\u201d he wrote. \u201cRespecting the referendum and closing this chapter so we can focus on delivering growth, and the public services people deserve, is the right thing to do for our country.\u201d Anand Menon, the director of UK in a Changing Europe, said: \u201cIt is a shame that the chancellor seems to feel that evidence is now superfluous to good policy making. Self evidently there is more at stake here than just economics. That being said, surely we deserve to know the different potential implications of different kinds of Brexit?\u201d Torsten Bell, the director of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said: \u201cThe chancellor is right to say lots of other things will affect what the economic outcome for Britain is. But what is true is that every major study done inside or outside government shows that a looser relationship with the EU, as envisaged in this agreement, leads to a smaller economy than it would otherwise be.\u201d The full text of the withdrawal agreement bill, which the government hopes to rush through parliament in order to leave the EU on 31 October, is expected to be published on Monday evening. Javid is due to hold a budget on 6 November, if Brexit goes ahead next week, and the independent Office for Budget Responsibility will then present updated economic forecasts, though it is unclear whether they have enough time to analyse the details of the Johnson deal. In the Commons, Labour\u2019s Ian Murray said he was unable to answer his constituents who ask about the impact Johnson\u2019s deal would have on their finances because the Government is \u201crefusing to publish an economic impact assessment\u201d. Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay replied: \u201cThe answer is to listen to the Bank of England governor who says that getting this deal passed will be a boost to our economy.\u201d Catherine McKinnell, Labour MP for Newcastle upon Tyne North, said MPs were being \u201cleft in the dark\u201d about the economic impact of the new Brexit deal. Responding, Barclay said: \u201cThe reality is that any modelling for the future would have to take on board what is the future direction of the (EU) Commission under the new leadership, it would have to consider what actions the UK Government would take in response.\u201d",

In her later years, Winifred enjoyed listening to classical music, studying Italian, Chinese painting, singing music-hall songs, flamenco dancing, drawing from life, writing fairy stories, cross-country skiing and entertaining a wide assortment of friends. I met Winifred at a concert of baroque music that I had organised in Kensington in 2005, and by pure coincidence we became neighbours the following year. She was a sociable and spontaneous woman, with boundless energy, who had a talent for the dramatic. A mischievous raconteur with an adventurous spirit, she was always dashing off to a new enterprise with a friend or two in tow. Peter died in 2008, and Winifred\u2019s younger sister, Frances, also predeceased her, in 2004.",

In June, the band went to Murray Island to get closer to Marou\u2019s musical influences, and record a film to go with a new single, Naba Norem \u2013 meaning \u201clet\u2019s go to the reef\u201d in the Meriam language. \u201cIt\u2019s not a coral cay so the impacts [of sea level rise] aren\u2019t as bad there, but my uncles pointed out some areas to me where my dad used to play, and where there used to be grassy banks. It was mind blowing.\u201d A few weeks later and Marou was back in the straits, working on a Queensland government project to find ways that tiny Masig Island could adopt lower-emissions technologies or renewable energy. His role is \u201cnot to be a guy from a band or a bureaucrat\u201d, he says, but to be a friendly face to break down a few barriers. \u201cThat was a real eye opener to see how it\u2019s affecting those low lying islands,\u201d he says. \u201cOne old guy just said they were becoming sad, and they were having mental health issues because they are watching their islands fading away. It\u2019s like a cancer eating at them. It breaks my heart to listen to these stories. These people are so connected to their country. \u201cThere are not too many high profile people coming out of there, so I\u2019m feeling like I should step up. I feel like I\u2019m responsible for being a voice for the Torres Straits.\u201d Since starting the band in 2007, Marou says they\u2019ve been busy \u201cwriting music and trying to be rock stars\u201d and were \u201coblivious\u201d to the impacts in the Torres Strait. \u201cIn the past, we have been scared to mention global warming\u201d he says. \u201cOn Masig island, one side where they get the northerlies their roads are totally gone now. On Mabuiag, if they get a tidal surge or a low at the same time as a king tide, houses are going under water and burial sites are going under water. \u201cOne thing we know for certain is that sea levels are rising. Yes, it\u2019s climate change.\u201d According to a climate change resilience plan developed for the Torres Straits, the island is seeing sea levels rising at between 6 and 8 millimetres per year \u2013 at least double the global average. \u201cI try to be realistic about this,\u201d says Marou. \u201cI\u2019m from central Queensland where the economy has relied on mining, so shutting down mine sites won\u2019t fix that beach, or stop those houses going under water. \u201cThe sea levels are rising and there are always climate shifts. But I have no doubt though that human influence is speeding up the process. I\u2019m still learning a lot. I certainly believe in global warming and we have definitely sped things up.\u201d Marou says locals told him they could fix some of the erosion issues \u201cwith some excavators and some sand\u201d but were frustrated at what they felt was government bureaucracy getting in the way. In 2016, islands in the western portion of the Torres Strait group were hit with severe coral bleaching caused by the same rising ocean temperatures that bleached large sections of the northern Great Barrier Reef. \u201cThey live off the reef,\u201d says Marou. \u201cMurray Island is surrounded by reefs and if the reef dies, the island dies because the reef protects the island.\u201d He said he was shocked at the rubbish that comes up onto the reef and beaches on ocean currents, in particular so-called \u201cghost nets\u201d \u2013 discarded fishing nets from commercial boats that get caught on reefs and entangle wildlife. \u201cIt\u2019s just insane. It make me so angry,\u201d he says. \u201cBoth Tom and I are passionate in raising awareness of what\u2019s going on up there. It\u2019s houses and grave sites under water, but people down in Sydney have no idea what\u2019s going on. \u201cWe\u2019re not a third world country and I found that aspect of it extremely sad.\u201d",

But there are worrying signs. The terms of reference for the inquiry include asking the reviewer, the former auditor general Peter Achterstraat, to \u201crecommend whether it is in the public interest to maintain an Independent Planning Commission\u201d. The IPC has come under fire from the Daily Telegraph, which has taken up the cause of the mining industry, following the IPC decision to block a major new coalmine in Bylong valley, proposed by the Korean miner Kepco, last month. It has blasted the IPC for taking account of 2,500 form submissions from environmental groups, branding them \u201cyuppies from Sydney\u2019s north shore\u201d, and implying they shouldn\u2019t have a say at all.

Or the need to think beyond coal and start planning for a future where other industries provide jobs in the regions. One of the big reforms introduced by the NSW Coalition in 2011 when it came to power was to put development approvals for contentious major projects increasingly into the hands of an independent arbiter. Labor set up the Planning Assessment Commission in 2008 in a bid to distance itself from a string of planning scandals involving a series of ministers. But major projects were still signed off by the planning minister, leading to ongoing allegations that decisions were swayed by political lobbying, pressure from developers and in some cases corruption. The former planning minister Frank Sartor was referred to the Independent Commission Against Corruption on several occasions over planning approvals including the redevelopment of Burwood town centre and a major greenfields development at Branxton, but no findings were made against him. There were further corruption inquiries into the grants of mining licences, plans to extend the coal facilities at Newcastle and private sector development of water infrastructure in Sydney\u2019s west by Australian Water Holdings. After the Doyles Creek mine scandal, which led to charges, a conviction and then a successful appeal by the former mining minister Ian Macdonald, the Independent Commission Against Corruption recommended (again) that ministers get out of approving developments. In 2011 the Coalition came to power promising to clean up planning and to date has consistently moved toward using independent panels to assess and more recently decide major projects. In March 2018 it introduced further reforms and renamed the PAC to the IPC , widening its remit to be the consent authority and making it clear it was indeed independent of government. At the local government level all councils were now required to have independent planning panels to assess larger and contentious projects. But this has angered developers and the mining industry, who are finding that they can\u2019t always have their way. Just to put this in perspective: the vast majority of projects before the IPC are approved, sometimes with conditions. Only a handful have been rejected over the years. Mostly the decisions follow the recommendation of the planning department. There have been a few problems. This year the IPC was forced to remake a decision after it announced its approval of the Rix Mine extension before submissions had closed.

The director general of planning has already recommended against the tower on the grounds that it is out of proportion with the heritage area, as have two architects asked by the government for their view. But the NSW government has found another way to appease the development industry. It has now declared it plans to change the planning controls and make Pyrmont the next frontier of expansion for the central business district. These sort of knee-jerk changes are always dressed up as making an area \u201cmore vibrant\u201d, \u201cworld class\u201d and ensuring that we send a signal that \u201cSydney is open for business\u201d. Announcing the new review, the planning and public spaces minister, Rob Stokes, said a two-month review of the IPC will be conducted by NSW commissioner for productivity, Peter Achterstraat, who will make recommendations to government about the IPC\u2019s purpose and structure. \u201cNSW is open for business and while we need a referee for some planning decisions, every referee needs a health check from time to time,\u201d Stokes said. Worrying. Among Achterstraat\u2019s tasks are to determine what should be the thresholds for the referral of matters to the IPC.

And while he could hardly say otherwise, on this news the expectations for further cuts were lowered, with a cut on Melbourne Cup day all but ruled out: And yet the market still believes the RBA will cut the cash rate to 0.5% by April next year. Just think about that \u2013 the head of the Reserve Bank suggests that after a soft period of growth things should improve next year, and yet investors still believe the cash rate will be cut to 1 and a half percentage points below the annual rate of inflation. Over the weekend also came news that the IMF \u2013 the same body that last week cut its outlook for growth this year to just 1.7% and for next year to 2.3% \u2013 broadly agreed with the government\u2019s policy to let the tax cuts do the fiscal stimulus.

      "bodyText": "The lawyer facing jail time for helping to expose an unlawful spy operation has called for urgent whistleblower reforms and warned defence and intelligence officers currently have \u201cnowhere to go\u201d when they witness serious misconduct. Bernard Collaery, the barrister and one-time attorney general of the ACT, has called for the creation of a new independent parliamentary body to provide an avenue for defence and intelligence whistleblowers. In an interview with Guardian Australia, Collaery said the current system gave such whistleblowers no real outlet to raise concerns. He said they were rarely shielded by whistleblower protections and the intelligence watchdog, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security (IGIS), had been found lacking in its ability to protect those who make disclosures. The gaps in the current system not only risk covering up wrongdoing, he said, but also encourage whistleblowers to go public in dangerous ways, potentially placing themselves at risk and compromising national security. \u201cThe whole process is unjust and a real threat to our nation,\u201d Collaery said. \u201cGenuine whistleblowers have nowhere to go. Nowhere to go at the moment. [Witness] K went to the IGIS, that\u2019s public knowledge. What happened? \u201cYou just cannot have those situations any further. For people in the defence and intelligence community, it\u2019s absolutely barren. There\u2019s nowhere to go.\u201d Collaery\u2019s comments come as Australia\u2019s media outlets unite to highlight creeping government secrecy, including through its treatment of whistleblowers like Collaery and Witness K. Collaery and Witness K helped to expose Australia\u2019s bugging of Timor-Leste during 2006 negotiations to carve up oil and gas resources in the Timor Sea. Witness K followed the proper procedures to avoid compromising national security and approached the IGIS. Collaery and Witness K have both been prosecuted for the disclosures, which were made during a confidential arbitration between Timor-Leste and Australia, and subsequently to the media after Australia seized legal documents belonging to Collaery and his team. Other whistleblowers are currently facing reprisals from a wide range of governments and institutions, including parking inspectors who spoke out about local council misconduct, a tax office worker who spoke out about aggressive debt collection tactics, a defence official who leaked documents about the Afghan war, and an academic who blew the whistle on student exploitation. The current whistleblower protection system generally encourages intelligence and defence whistleblowers to make reports internally \u2013 often an unviable prospect for those who need to raise concerns outside of the chain of command \u2013 or approach the IGIS. Collaery has proposed a new statutory oversight body, made up of \u201ceminent, distinguished politicians\u201d who are approved via a public confirmation hearing, much like the process followed in the US. The body would have broad operational oversight of intelligence agencies, and be aided by a co-opted expert panel. It would be able to deal with whistleblowers confidentially, including in a more proactive sense for those still considering whether to come forward. It should also be designed to encourage complaints on current wrongdoing, rather than focusing only on past conduct, he said. Collaery is currently awaiting trial for the disclosures. That trial will itself be partially heard in secret.",

      "body": "<p>Growing up, Adit Gauchan was taught that life is suffering. Raised a Buddhist, the producer \u2013 who comprises Sydney hip-hop group Horrorshow alongside rapper Nick Bryant-Smith \u2013 absorbed this central tenet of the religion from an early age. \u201cSometimes people hear that and they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh that\u2019s such a dark, depressing way to look at things.\u2019 It\u2019s more just an acknowledgement of what life is. That\u2019s a certainty: there will be suffering, and it\u2019s about what you do with it that really counts.\u201d</p> <p>Gauchan and Bryant-Smith leaned on these ideas \u2013 and one another \u2013 in the two years since their last record, Bardo State, was released in 2017. Six weeks after the album came out, a person very close to Bryant-Smith was diagnosed with stage-four bowel cancer. His priority for the next two years became surgeries and treatment, rather than the touring and press that would normally follow a release.</p> <p>\u201cEverything turned upside down overnight,\u201d he says. \u201cI had to step up and really take on the carer role and assist them with navigating that whole journey.\u201d</p> <p>The pair approached our interview with a vulnerability at odds with the boisterous cheekiness ingrained in much of Australian hip-hop. Since recording their debut album in high school, Horrorshow has established itself as a sophisticated outfit, as likely to rap about mental health and philosophy as they are about parties and breakups. They\u2019ve since collected two Aria nominations, critical praise and a dedicated fan base who regularly sell out their tours around the country.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/20/highway-to-hell-all-four-lanes-of-major-perth-highway-to-be-close-for-festival-of-acdc-covers\">Highway to Hell: 10km of major Perth highway to shut for AC/DC covers concert</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When Bryant-Smith learned of the cancer diagnosis, they had to cancel a bucket-list spot at a US hip-hop festival; but they put on a brave face as they took to the stage at the biggest venues they\u2019d ever played in Australia. They were juggling the challenge of promoting their fourth album \u201cwith the kind of news that usually stops your life\u201d, Gauchan says. Bryant-Smith\u2019s reality became the jarring collision of the \u201csober, somber\u201d silence of the hospital \u201cand then going back out on the road and being in a loud, noisy, not sober, not somber, celebratory place where you\u2019re the centre of attention\u201d.</p> <p>Eight months later, as they prepared to celebrate the 10-year anniversary of their 2008 debut record The Grey Space with a sold-out national tour, the pair retreated to the coastal town of Currarong for some time away from it all, Gauchan remembers. \u201cThen pretty much the day I got back, my dad calls me: my brother [had] been diagnosed with testicular cancer.\u201d</p> <p>Less than a year later, in January this year, Gauchan\u2019s younger brother Ashim passed away.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4f30137a155e737776d657341647ae3039fc3138\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f30137a155e737776d657341647ae3039fc3138/0_0_1181_787/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Australian hip-hop duo Horrorshow.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gauchan and Bryant-Smith describe the past two years as a \u2018storm\u2019 they weathered together.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cole Bennetts</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We meet on the release day of Horrorshow\u2019s fifth record, New Normal, and it\u2019s a day that has conjured complex emotions.

It\u2019s the first time he\u2019s discussed what was happening these past two years with anyone outside his inner circle \u2013 a pain he speaks of not only in this interview but on the album itself, which Gauchan describes as Horrorshow\u2019s \u201cmost personal record to date\u201d.</p> <p>New Normal\u2019s cover art shows the pair in a car, dwarfed by the King George V Memorial hospital standing sentinel behind them. Part of the Royal Prince Alfred hospital complex he visited almost daily for two years, Bryant-Smith \u201cgot to know that whole complex much better than I would\u2019ve liked to\u201d. The looming building also appears as the backdrop to album prologue <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZD0lIl5auWE\">88 Bars</a>. \u201c<em>Don\u2019t think I don\u2019t appreciate the irony of showing you my diary, hoping that you respect my privacy</em>,\u201d Bryant-Smith raps.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZD0lIl5auWE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZD0lIl5auWE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t lost on me that our last album was called Bardo State,\u201d he says. \u201cThe idea of the Bardo [in Buddhism] is all about being caught between two lives on Earth. Looking back on it, I do feel as if, in some strange way, it foreshadowed what the next couple of years would be like for the two of us: moving back and forth between two lives. And trying to not lose yourself and your shit in that process.\u201d</p> <p>As Bryant-Smith offers this analogy, he begins to choke up, then apologises. Gauchan quietly retrieves a pouch of tissues from his pocket and tucks one into his friend\u2019s hand. It\u2019s like a secret handshake, their 20 years of friendship distilled into one motion in which you can picture them as kids, surreptitiously passing notes under school desks or sliding contraband against one another\u2019s palms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b76c77804d4d3c8b35dbd76768bdfa6700f0071\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b76c77804d4d3c8b35dbd76768bdfa6700f0071/453_87_589_700/421.jpg\" alt=\"HOrroshow\" width=\"421\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Adit and I have been friends since we were 12 ...

But the events of the last couple of years have brought us even closer and made us appreciate each other even more,\u201d he says. They learned to \u201cpass the baton\u201d: when one needed to step into the role of carer, the other would handle Horrorshow business. Bryant-Smith gave Gauchan advice; Gauchan gave his friend a copy of The Art of Happiness.<em> </em>(\u201cShouts to the Dalai Lama,\u201d Bryant-Smith offers sincerely, through tears.)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/06/archie-roach-hallie-and-caiti-baker-best-australian-music-for-october\">Archie Roach, Hallie and Caiti Baker: best Australian music for October</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As well as close friends, family and partners, Bryant-Smith says that when he looks back on the past two years, \u201cin the middle of that storm \u2026 it\u2019s Adit and I right there, in the thick of it, together\u201d.</p> <p>The cinematic and tortured album track Limitless honours Gauchan\u2019s brother; its title is the English translation of his name from Sanskrit. Ashim lived with severe autism and was non-verbal, and their mother always described him as like an angel. \u201cHe was this ball of joy,\u201d Gauchan says. \u201cHe just wanted to be around people and was always an attention-seeker. That was the energy that he exhibited through this whole struggle, right to the end. He couldn\u2019t say, \u2018Why me?\u2019 but it didn\u2019t even feel like that was a thought that had entered his mind.\u201d</p> <p>The record provided catharsis, but there\u2019s a fear that it comes at a cost.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you work on a record, it keeps you in the headspace that led to you creating those songs,\u201d Bryant-Smith says. \u201cI\u2019ve had my moments where I freaked out about that and Adit has reminded me, like, \u2018Bro, this is part of the process and we have to let this go\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Ultimately, Bryant-Smith says, Horroshow\u2019s music serves the same therapeutic purpose today as it did when they were teenagers navigating young love and monotonous train rides in the inner west of Sydney. \u201cI feel proud that we\u2019ve been able to wrestle with all this stuff and turn it into this record \u2013 what is it, like 55 minutes or some shit? \u2013 and then give it to everyone else, and hope that they find something in it. We\u2019ve got to have faith in the process and releasing the songs is the next step.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 New Normal by Horrorshow is out now through Elefant Traks.

The looming building also appears as the backdrop to album prologue 88 Bars. \u201cDon\u2019t think I don\u2019t appreciate the irony of showing you my diary, hoping that you respect my privacy,\u201d Bryant-Smith raps. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t lost on me that our last album was called Bardo State,\u201d he says. \u201cThe idea of the Bardo [in Buddhism] is all about being caught between two lives on Earth. Looking back on it, I do feel as if, in some strange way, it foreshadowed what the next couple of years would be like for the two of us: moving back and forth between two lives. And trying to not lose yourself and your shit in that process.\u201d As Bryant-Smith offers this analogy, he begins to choke up, then apologises. Gauchan quietly retrieves a pouch of tissues from his pocket and tucks one into his friend\u2019s hand. It\u2019s like a secret handshake, their 20 years of friendship distilled into one motion in which you can picture them as kids, surreptitiously passing notes under school desks or sliding contraband against one another\u2019s palms. \u201cAdit and I have been friends since we were 12 years old and we\u2019ve been brothers for a long time. But the events of the last couple of years have brought us even closer and made us appreciate each other even more,\u201d he says. They learned to \u201cpass the baton\u201d: when one needed to step into the role of carer, the other would handle Horrorshow business. Bryant-Smith gave Gauchan advice; Gauchan gave his friend a copy of The Art of Happiness. (\u201cShouts to the Dalai Lama,\u201d Bryant-Smith offers sincerely, through tears.) As well as close friends, family and partners, Bryant-Smith says that when he looks back on the past two years, \u201cin the middle of that storm \u2026 it\u2019s Adit and I right there, in the thick of it, together\u201d. The cinematic and tortured album track Limitless honours Gauchan\u2019s brother; its title is the English translation of his name from Sanskrit. Ashim lived with severe autism and was non-verbal, and their mother always described him as like an angel. \u201cHe was this ball of joy,\u201d Gauchan says. \u201cHe just wanted to be around people and was always an attention-seeker. That was the energy that he exhibited through this whole struggle, right to the end. He couldn\u2019t say, \u2018Why me?\u2019 but it didn\u2019t even feel like that was a thought that had entered his mind.\u201d The record provided catharsis, but there\u2019s a fear that it comes at a cost. \u201cWhen you work on a record, it keeps you in the headspace that led to you creating those songs,\u201d Bryant-Smith says. \u201cI\u2019ve had my moments where I freaked out about that and Adit has reminded me, like, \u2018Bro, this is part of the process and we have to let this go\u2019.\u201d Ultimately, Bryant-Smith says, Horroshow\u2019s music serves the same therapeutic purpose today as it did when they were teenagers navigating young love and monotonous train rides in the inner west of Sydney. \u201cI feel proud that we\u2019ve been able to wrestle with all this stuff and turn it into this record \u2013 what is it, like 55 minutes or some shit? \u2013 and then give it to everyone else, and hope that they find something in it. We\u2019ve got to have faith in the process and releasing the songs is the next step.\u201d \u2022 New Normal by Horrorshow is out now through Elefant Traks. They are touring Australia through November",

For four decades the EU has set minimum standards in the workplace on protection from discrimination, pregnancy, maternity and paternity rights, part-time, fixed term and agency workers\u2019 rights, the famous working time directive, and holiday pay, and health and safety.</p> <p>There were clearly areas in which the EU did not do enough \u2013 most glaringly, on zero-hours contracts. Yet the bid by the handful of Labour MPs determined to vote through Johnson\u2019s deal \u2013 to decry the EU as a set of capitalist institutions, without any social basis \u2013 is cynical. Such rights as UK workers currently enjoy have been enshrined by European law. Without provision for the protection and enforcement of those rights, they could be dismantled by a Conservative government at any time.</p> <p>To recap the Conservatives\u2019 record on this: in 2011, after the coalition government came in, David Cameron\u2019s strategy chief Steve Hilton reportedly flew the kite of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/blog/2011/jul/28/steve-hilton-conservative-blue-sky-thinking\" title=\"\">suspending maternity leave</a>, just temporarily, while they repaired the \u201cdamage done by the last Labour government\u201d. He would have been prevented by EU law. However, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-40727400\" title=\"\">employment tribunal fees</a> were introduced, which effectively curtailed maternity and other rights by making it expensive \u2013 often prohibitively \u2013 for an employee to enforce them. (These fees were subsequently <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-40727400\" title=\"\">ruled unlawful</a> by the supreme court.)</p> <p>They increased the qualifying period for unfair dismissal claims from one to two years\u2019 employment; imposed a cap on compensation for this of one year\u2019s pay; and after their election victory in 2015, the Tories brought in the notorious Trade Union Act to make collective action \u2013 specifically strike action \u2013 harder.</p> <p>To reassure workers about a future Conservative government, last week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/13/tories-distract-from-brexit-crime-focused-queens-speech\" title=\"\">Queen\u2019s speech</a> would have had to include three things: the promise of a \u201cstandstill\u201d, so that existing rights couldn\u2019t be rolled back; the promise of dynamic alignment with the EU on those existing rights, in the case of their extension; and a statement of intention on workers\u2019 rights legislation, to meet the new challenges of insecurity and low wages. The speech mentioned none of those things.</p> <p>Piece together the Conservative party\u2019s track record with its present rhetoric, or lack of it, and you have to accept deregulation of the workplace and disempowerment of the individual as the inevitable and deliberate consequences of this form of Brexit.</p> <p>And this is where they may have laid a bear-trap for themselves in the coming election. Despite those moves under Cameron, the steady erosion of workplace rights over the past decade was not pinned on any single political party. Rather, it was understood as something more amorphous: the pressures of the market, the \u201cnew rules\u201d of the innovators, and as such, the price of modernity.</p> <p>The introduction of tribunal fees and the undermining of union power paled into insignificance beside the far more alarming stories: the woman who gave birth in the toilet of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/sep/29/sports-directs-bbc-toilet-birth\" title=\"\">Sports Direct warehouse</a> because she was afraid of missing her shift; the hyper-surveillance practices at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/31/amazon-warehouse-wristband-tracking\" title=\"\">Amazon</a>; the heads-we-win, tails-you-lose employment model of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/20/deliveroo-uber-workers-pay-gig-economy\" title=\"\">Deliveroo and Uber</a>, where everyone is self-employed, but no one is emancipated.</p> <p>\u201cZero hours\u201d became a shorthand, an umbrella term for a gig economy in which the balance of power was skewed so remarkably, so suddenly toward the employer that the much slower, more iterative cogs of parliament were seen as more or less irrelevant to it. And the issue itself, although vast \u2013 insecurity, underemployment, low wages, dehumanised conditions, poor career progression, the impossibility of collective action when the job itself is precarious, all feeding into one another in a feedback loop \u2013 was seen as the new normal, which only the kind of unhelpful people who intervene with words such as \u201cstructural\u201d and \u201cinequality\u201d would talk about.</p> <p>A government that, explicitly or implicitly, sets out to unpick rights that people have understood and relied on for decades changes the debate entirely.

      "bodyText": "It is not unreasonable for the Institute for Fiscal Studies, and assorted organisations concerned with the nation\u2019s prosperity, to concentrate on the future of the customs union \u2013 or more precisely, what the future for British workers will look like without it. \u201cThe jobs or wages of men with low formal qualifications working in skilled manual occupations may be under particular threat,\u201d remarked Agnes Norris Keiller, author of the IFS report, leaving \u201cas you might expect, if you decimate your manufacturing sector\u201d judiciously unsaid. However, the trade union movement is looking just as keenly at what Boris Johnson\u2019s agreement means for workers\u2019 rights. For four decades the EU has set minimum standards in the workplace on protection from discrimination, pregnancy, maternity and paternity rights, part-time, fixed term and agency workers\u2019 rights, the famous working time directive, and holiday pay, and health and safety. There were clearly areas in which the EU did not do enough \u2013 most glaringly, on zero-hours contracts. Yet the bid by the handful of Labour MPs determined to vote through Johnson\u2019s deal \u2013 to decry the EU as a set of capitalist institutions, without any social basis \u2013 is cynical. Such rights as UK workers currently enjoy have been enshrined by European law. Without provision for the protection and enforcement of those rights, they could be dismantled by a Conservative government at any time. To recap the Conservatives\u2019 record on this: in 2011, after the coalition government came in, David Cameron\u2019s strategy chief Steve Hilton reportedly flew the kite of suspending maternity leave, just temporarily, while they repaired the \u201cdamage done by the last Labour government\u201d. He would have been prevented by EU law. However, employment tribunal fees were introduced, which effectively curtailed maternity and other rights by making it expensive \u2013 often prohibitively \u2013 for an employee to enforce them. (These fees were subsequently ruled unlawful by the supreme court.) They increased the qualifying period for unfair dismissal claims from one to two years\u2019 employment; imposed a cap on compensation for this of one year\u2019s pay; and after their election victory in 2015, the Tories brought in the notorious Trade Union Act to make collective action \u2013 specifically strike action \u2013 harder. To reassure workers about a future Conservative government, last week\u2019s Queen\u2019s speech would have had to include three things: the promise of a \u201cstandstill\u201d, so that existing rights couldn\u2019t be rolled back; the promise of dynamic alignment with the EU on those existing rights, in the case of their extension; and a statement of intention on workers\u2019 rights legislation, to meet the new challenges of insecurity and low wages. The speech mentioned none of those things. Piece together the Conservative party\u2019s track record with its present rhetoric, or lack of it, and you have to accept deregulation of the workplace and disempowerment of the individual as the inevitable and deliberate consequences of this form of Brexit. And this is where they may have laid a bear-trap for themselves in the coming election. Despite those moves under Cameron, the steady erosion of workplace rights over the past decade was not pinned on any single political party. Rather, it was understood as something more amorphous: the pressures of the market, the \u201cnew rules\u201d of the innovators, and as such, the price of modernity. The introduction of tribunal fees and the undermining of union power paled into insignificance beside the far more alarming stories: the woman who gave birth in the toilet of a Sports Direct warehouse because she was afraid of missing her shift; the hyper-surveillance practices at Amazon; the heads-we-win, tails-you-lose employment model of Deliveroo and Uber, where everyone is self-employed, but no one is emancipated. \u201cZero hours\u201d became a shorthand, an umbrella term for a gig economy in which the balance of power was skewed so remarkably, so suddenly toward the employer that the much slower, more iterative cogs of parliament were seen as more or less irrelevant to it. And the issue itself, although vast \u2013 insecurity, underemployment, low wages, dehumanised conditions, poor career progression, the impossibility of collective action when the job itself is precarious, all feeding into one another in a feedback loop \u2013 was seen as the new normal, which only the kind of unhelpful people who intervene with words such as \u201cstructural\u201d and \u201cinequality\u201d would talk about. A government that, explicitly or implicitly, sets out to unpick rights that people have understood and relied on for decades changes the debate entirely. The right to paid holiday, for example, may have become largely theoretical to people working \u201cflexibly\u201d; once it comes under threat for the general workforce, new axes of solidarity will inevitably form. It will not be possible to fight to retain this right without extending the battle to include those in precarious jobs. The fight for maternity leave will extend to those who have slipped though the net of its provision. The unions, particularly the GMB, are already considering how best to bring together, mobilise and empower workers who exist outside the traditional institutions of collective action. The threat to rights this current Brexit presents does more than draw attention to a deeper erosion that has evolved over the course of this century: it brings an impetus, unity and urgency to the resistance that industrial tensions have so far lacked. And, if it all unfolds according to the Conservatives\u2019 strategic vision, just in time for a general election. \u2022 Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist",

Under a 17th-century convention <a href=\"https://erskinemay.parliament.uk/\">laid out in Erskine May</a>, the official handbook of parliamentary procedure: \u201cA motion or an amendment which is the same, in substance, as a question which has been decided during a session may not be brought forward again during that same session.\u201d</p> <p>Bercow ruled that in seeking approval for Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal on Saturday and \u2013 after being frustrated by an amendment \u2013 on Monday, both the substance and the circumstances of the issues were fundamentally the same.</p> <h2>Do Brexiters agree?</h2> <p>No. In a series of points of order following Bercow\u2019s statement, pro-Brexit Conservatives lined up to argue that circumstances had changed, in that since the Saturday vote Johnson had written to the EU to request a departure extension. Bercow, however, noted that this was simply the prime minister abiding by a law obliging him to do this if his deal had not been approved by that date, and so was only routine.</p> <h2>Was the motion actually passed on Saturday?</h2> <p>Yes \u2013 even though there was no vote. The government convened the Saturday sitting in the hope of winning a straight yes/no vote on Johnson\u2019s deal. However, the motion approving the deal could be amended, and MPs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/19/mps-put-brakes-on-boris-johnsons-brexit-deal-with-rebel-letwin-amendment\">first voted for an amendment</a> tabled by the Conservative Oliver Letwin, which dictated that approval should be withheld until the associated Brexit legislation laying out the terms of departure was also presented and passed.</p> <p>Ministers objected to this amendment, not least as it meant the 31 October Brexit deadline was unlikely to be met. Thus, when it was passed, the government and opposition decided together to not hold a vote on the now-amended motion. But this did not mean the issue was not decided \u2013 the motion was deemed to have passed without a vote, and thus decided by MPs. This was why Bercow objected to a second go.</p> <h2>What happens next?</h2> <p>The focus now moves to the <a href=\"https://ukandeu.ac.uk/a-step-by-step-guide-to-the-withdrawal-agreement-bill/\">withdrawal agreement </a><a href=\"https://ukandeu.ac.uk/a-step-by-step-guide-to-the-withdrawal-agreement-bill/\">bill</a>, or WAB, which lays out the legal basis for the UK\u2019s withdrawal under treaty. This was set to receive the formality of a first reading later on Monday, with the first vote, on the second reading, taking place on Tuesday.</p> <p>The second reading will be a good test of support, but even assuming it passes, the government\u2019s difficulties could begin in the next stage of the WAB, when MPs can table amendments. Among <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/21/how-the-numbers-add-up-on-brexit-deal-and-possible-amendments\">amendments expected</a> are ones seeking a customs union with the EU for the whole UK and one making approval of the Brexit deal conditional on a second referendum.</p> <p>If any of these amendments are passed, it will not only require a departure extension but will effectively wreck the bill for the government. The most likely outcome then would be for Johnson to seek an election. However, if all the amendments fail then MPs will be worked flat-out to try and pass the necessary legislation for Johnson\u2019s deal before 31 October.</p> <h2>How annoyed will Johnson be?</h2> <p>It depends. On the one hand, he will not be happy that his much-touted \u201csuper Saturday\u201d sitting of parliament, an attempt to raise the stakes and push MPs into backing his deal, was sidetracked by the Letwin amendment, especially when he might have secured the necessary votes. The inability to try again with a vote on the deal also leads the process into the murky waters of an amendable bill.</p> <p>But the tactics of MPs, and the optics of Bercow blocking a second vote \u2013 however in line with procedure \u2013 will help feed into Johnson\u2019s preferred \u201cpeople v parliament\u201d election narrative, in which he would fight as a prime minister who delivered a deal but was thwarted by those seeking to delay or obstruct Brexit.</p> <p>With this narrative amplified by sympathetic newspapers armed with attack lines dictated by \u201cNo 10 sources\u201d, it could end up with Johnson returned to power with a workable majority, and the ability to shape Brexit as he sees fit. But elections can be fickle things.

The second reading will be a good test of support, but even assuming it passes, the government\u2019s difficulties could begin in the next stage of the WAB, when MPs can table amendments. Among amendments expected are ones seeking a customs union with the EU for the whole UK and one making approval of the Brexit deal conditional on a second referendum. If any of these amendments are passed, it will not only require a departure extension but will effectively wreck the bill for the government. The most likely outcome then would be for Johnson to seek an election. However, if all the amendments fail then MPs will be worked flat-out to try and pass the necessary legislation for Johnson\u2019s deal before 31 October. How annoyed will Johnson be? It depends. On the one hand, he will not be happy that his much-touted \u201csuper Saturday\u201d sitting of parliament, an attempt to raise the stakes and push MPs into backing his deal, was sidetracked by the Letwin amendment, especially when he might have secured the necessary votes. The inability to try again with a vote on the deal also leads the process into the murky waters of an amendable bill. But the tactics of MPs, and the optics of Bercow blocking a second vote \u2013 however in line with procedure \u2013 will help feed into Johnson\u2019s preferred \u201cpeople v parliament\u201d election narrative, in which he would fight as a prime minister who delivered a deal but was thwarted by those seeking to delay or obstruct Brexit. With this narrative amplified by sympathetic newspapers armed with attack lines dictated by \u201cNo 10 sources\u201d, it could end up with Johnson returned to power with a workable majority, and the ability to shape Brexit as he sees fit. But elections can be fickle things. Just ask Theresa May.",

      "bodyText": "British battery pioneers plan to build Europe\u2019s largest energy storage project using a cryogenic battery that can store renewable energy for weeks rather than hours. The device will be built on the site of an old fossil fuel plant in the north of England to power up to 50,000 homes for up to five hours. Unlike traditional lithium-ion batteries, which typically store electricity for a few hours, the \u201ccryobattery\u201d will be able to store energy for months. The UK\u2019s first full-scale cryobattery, developed by Highview Power, uses renewable electricity to chill air to -196C, transforming it into a liquid that will be stored in large metal tanks. When renewable electricity levels are low the liquid can be turned back into gas, which is used to turn a turbine and generate electricity \u2013 but without burning the gas and releasing emissions. Highview Power claims its cryobattery will be the largest project in Europe capable of long-term energy storage. The full-scale \u201cliquid air\u201d battery has a capacity of 50MW or 250MWh over a five-hour release time. It follows the success of a 5MW pathfinder project built next to a landfill site in Bury, Greater Manchester, in summer 2018 with \u00a38m of funding from Innovate UK. The chief executive of Highview Power said the battery could provide cost-efficient energy storage at old fossil fuel plants across the country to help balance the energy system. \u201cMore and more power plants are going to be decommissioned, and we are bringing a solution which can use the same energy infrastructure and grid connections to give a new life to these sites,\u201d Javier Cavada said. He added that long-duration, giga-scale energy storage was the \u201cnecessary foundation\u201d to help build a carbon-free energy system that relies heavily on wind and solar power. The global shift towards clean electricity has spurred a boom in battery technology development to help harness wind and solar energy, and a flurry of investment plans from energy utilities. Highview said the cryobattery would cost about \u00a3110 per MWh of electricity, using a 200MW system, which would make it one of the cheapest energy storage technologies. The claim comes after an Edinburgh-based start-up, Gravitricity, said Britain\u2019s cheapest virtual battery could be created by hoisting and dropping 12,000-tonne weights down disused mine shafts. A study by Imperial College London said the gravity energy could cost $171 (\u00a3132) per MWh, compared with an average lithium-ion project of $367 (\u00a3283) per MWh. Cavada said the company planned to finalise agreements with its project partner and would secure deals with National Grid to help provide grid balancing services. He declined to comment on the name of the disused power plant Highview planned to use.",

Rahayu\u2019s 6.995 seconds eclipsed the record set by her challenger \u2013 China\u2019s Song Yiling \u2013 who finished the 15-meter course in 7.101 seconds in April.</p> \n<p>So what is speed climbing exactly? And how difficult was Rayahu\u2019s accomplishment?</p> \n<p>Speed climbing is one of the three disciplines of the climbing event that will debut at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Think of it as a <a href=\"https://www.climbing.com/news/vertical-triathlon-the-future-of-climbing-in-the-olympics/\">climbing triathlon</a>: competitors will be graded on their combined results of speed climbing (a timed race between two athletes on a 15-meter wall), bouldering (a graded course with multiple routes of varying difficulty to be completed in four minutes) and lead climbing (how high a climber can go in six minutes).</p> \n<p>Rahayu is a speed climbing specialist. Dubbed \u201cSpiderwoman\u201d after a standout 2018 performance, the 24-year-old star was the lone Indonesian athlete to appear on Forbes Asia\u2019s \u201c30 Under 30\u201d list and will likely compete for gold next summer in Tokyo.</p> \n<p>Critics of speed climbing inclusion cite its lack of focus on technique and concentration; but the winner of any race will have identified the wall\u2019s tightest angles and secured their feet and hands on the holds without slipping, all while going as quickly as possible. Notice that Rayahu\u2019s opponent \u2013 the former world record holder Yiling \u2013 slips at the beginning of the race and still completes the course in under 10 seconds.</p> \n<p>To process how quickly Rahayu reached the top of the wall, she averaged a speed of roughly 7.71 km/h over 15 meters. That\u2019s the equivalent of running a 5K in 39 minutes \u2013 while doing pull-ups. Rahayu managed to keep that pace while running up a wall <a href=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/57e82f0b725e255db31d4df4/1494167419660-HOL4UGW7G1EMSRHED6JR/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kMXRibDYMhUiookWqwUxEZ97gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0luUmcNM2NMBIHLdYyXL-Jww_XBra4mrrAHD6FMA3bNKOBm5vyMDUBjVQdcIrt03OQ/IMG_2009.JPG\">that looks like this</a>.</p> \n<p>Pretty impressive, right?</p>",

So what is speed climbing exactly? And how difficult was Rayahu\u2019s accomplishment? Speed climbing is one of the three disciplines of the climbing event that will debut at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Think of it as a climbing triathlon: competitors will be graded on their combined results of speed climbing (a timed race between two athletes on a 15-meter wall), bouldering (a graded course with multiple routes of varying difficulty to be completed in four minutes) and lead climbing (how high a climber can go in six minutes). Rahayu is a speed climbing specialist. Dubbed \u201cSpiderwoman\u201d after a standout 2018 performance, the 24-year-old star was the lone Indonesian athlete to appear on Forbes Asia\u2019s \u201c30 Under 30\u201d list and will likely compete for gold next summer in Tokyo. Critics of speed climbing inclusion cite its lack of focus on technique and concentration; but the winner of any race will have identified the wall\u2019s tightest angles and secured their feet and hands on the holds without slipping, all while going as quickly as possible. Notice that Rayahu\u2019s opponent \u2013 the former world record holder Yiling \u2013 slips at the beginning of the race and still completes the course in under 10 seconds. To process how quickly Rahayu reached the top of the wall, she averaged a speed of roughly 7.71 km/h over 15 meters. That\u2019s the equivalent of running a 5K in 39 minutes \u2013 while doing pull-ups. Rahayu managed to keep that pace while running up a wall that looks like this. Pretty impressive, right?",

Why our brains tell us it only happens to other people</a>\u201d (19 October) Ian Sample describes fascinating research in Israel that investigates a biological reason built into our brains for our inability to think through our own deaths \u2013 a reason, moreover, that may have provided evolutionary advantages in the development of mankind.</p> <p>Being of an age when I frequently think towards my own death, I have realised that there is also an ontological reason for my inability to follow this train of thought through \u2013 a reason, perhaps, even with theological implications for the belief in an immortal soul. For, unless such a soul survives my bodily existence (a belief I myself cannot hold), what entity is there left that can contemplate me at the moment of my extinction and thereafter? Or, indeed, to see the world around me? And that is, perhaps, even more terrifying. Will the world cease to exist at the moment of my death? George Berkeley \u2013 and Ronald Knox \u2013 would reply that an all-seeing God continues to exist and see; a way of combatting terror that I cannot share.</p> <p>The philosophical aspect of this has, of course, been developed into the ontology of \u201cliving towards death\u201d by Martin Heidegger in Being and Time \u2013 not, I imagine, the most popular philosopher in Israel because of his culturally racist and politically Nazi orientation, but an influential thinker nonetheless.<br><strong><em>Michael Graubart</em></strong><br><em>Former director of music, Morley College, and senior lecturer in academic studies, Royal Northern College of Music</em></p> <p>\u2022 Reading this article reminded me of a conversation I had as a fortysomething with my dad, well into his 70s, about how he came to terms with his own mortality. He put it down to entering the \u201cobituary belt\u201d, where you are increasingly reading obituaries of your peers, and attending more funerals than weddings. Now into my 70s, I find the first page I turn to in the Guardian is the obituaries. I\u2019m also developing a liking for egg sandwiches, a staple of a good funeral.

      "bodyText": "In \u201cDeath? Why our brains tell us it only happens to other people\u201d (19 October) Ian Sample describes fascinating research in Israel that investigates a biological reason built into our brains for our inability to think through our own deaths \u2013 a reason, moreover, that may have provided evolutionary advantages in the development of mankind. Being of an age when I frequently think towards my own death, I have realised that there is also an ontological reason for my inability to follow this train of thought through \u2013 a reason, perhaps, even with theological implications for the belief in an immortal soul. For, unless such a soul survives my bodily existence (a belief I myself cannot hold), what entity is there left that can contemplate me at the moment of my extinction and thereafter? Or, indeed, to see the world around me? And that is, perhaps, even more terrifying. Will the world cease to exist at the moment of my death? George Berkeley \u2013 and Ronald Knox \u2013 would reply that an all-seeing God continues to exist and see; a way of combatting terror that I cannot share. The philosophical aspect of this has, of course, been developed into the ontology of \u201cliving towards death\u201d by Martin Heidegger in Being and Time \u2013 not, I imagine, the most popular philosopher in Israel because of his culturally racist and politically Nazi orientation, but an influential thinker nonetheless. Michael Graubart Former director of music, Morley College, and senior lecturer in academic studies, Royal Northern College of Music \u2022 Reading this article reminded me of a conversation I had as a fortysomething with my dad, well into his 70s, about how he came to terms with his own mortality. He put it down to entering the \u201cobituary belt\u201d, where you are increasingly reading obituaries of your peers, and attending more funerals than weddings. Now into my 70s, I find the first page I turn to in the Guardian is the obituaries. I\u2019m also developing a liking for egg sandwiches, a staple of a good funeral. And yes, now I\u2019m comfortable with my own mortality.

One of the boys died at the scene and the other was taken to hospital where he died early on Sunday. Police said masked assailants arrived uninvited at the party and perpetrated the stabbings in was believed locally to be a gang-related incident. As detectives made further appeals for information on Monday, an increased police presence remained at the scene in Emerson Valley, with officers conducting house-to-house inquiries. \u201cWe know that the party was a private birthday party, and although we believe that all of those involved were known to each other, we believe that those responsible arrived at the party uninvited, wore face coverings and they were armed with knives in what appears to be a targeted attack,\u201d said Det Ch Supt Ian Hunter of Thames Valley police. \u201cWe are following a number of active lines of inquiry at this time, including speaking to those who were guests at the party and the two injured victims. Whilst no arrests have yet been made, we are working around the clock to make arrests and are continuing to search relevant places.\u201d He added: \u201cI have a clear message to those responsible. We are looking for you and I urge you to hand yourself into a police station as soon as possible. I also wish to remind anybody that might be assisting or asked to assist those responsible that it is a criminal offence to do so and can lead to prosecution.\u201d The victims have been named locally as Dom Ansah and Ben Gillham-Rice. Postmortems are due to take place on Tuesday. Two other males, a 17-year-old and a 23-year-old, were injured during the incident. One has been discharged, and the other is recovering from his injuries. Thames Valley police are also investigating an alleged GBH incident after officers were called to an address in Greenleys, on the outskirts of Milton Keynes, on Sunday night after reports that a man had been stabbed. It was unknown whether this was a retaliatory attack. The Conservative MP for the area, Iain Stewart, tweeted: \u201cI am shocked by this double murder in my constituency.

      "body": "<p>A healthy democracy depends on an active citizenry which is able to make informed decisions. That is, in theory, the role of the fourth estate: to help the public understand their own society and the world around them, to hold the powerful to account and to challenge myths and expose uncomfortable truths. You do not need to be a long-time critic of the British media ecosystem to see those basic functions are not being satisfied when it comes to Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal. Rather than detailed scrutiny being applied to the most important single political event since the second world war, it has been reduced to a spectacle, a pantomime, all framed on the government\u2019s own terms.</p> <p>Just as Theresa May\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2018/sep/21/brexit-no-deal-is-better-than-a-bad-deal-says-theresa-may-video\" title=\"\">no deal is better than a bad deal</a>\u201d bluster collided with political reality, Johnson\u2019s demagoguery was followed by his own capitulation to the EU\u2019s red lines. Yet his embrace of a deal first offered by the EU 19 months ago \u2013 and rejected by May as something \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/feb/28/all-eyes-on-theresa-mays-brexit-speech-amid-friction-over-irish-border\" title=\"\">no UK prime minister could ever agree to</a>\u201d \u2013 has been presented as an against-all-odds, critic-defying triumph. The consequences of a deal predicted to strip the country of \u00a3130bn worth of growth \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/17/uk-lost-gdp-growth-brexit-deal-passed-official-estimates\" title=\"\">making the average Briton \u00a32,250 a year poorer over the next 15 years</a> \u2013 should be front and centre in the debate.

Yet most of the British press focused on the theatrics of the prime minister not signing a letter and sending a copy of the Benn act instead. This is, of course, exactly the framing the Tories desire.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/15/johnson-brexit-deal-confrontation-eu-britain\">Any Johnson Brexit deal sows seeds of future confrontation with the EU | Rafael Behr</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are excellent, perceptive political reporters. But too much political reporting trivialises coverage of political events, reducing them to a crude soap opera, centred on personalities and tittle tattle, rather than explaining competing ideas or worldviews, or placing them in a broader social context. Drama takes priority over substance.</p> <p>It does help, of course, that the Tories have the active, partisan editorial support of most of the British press, while sympathisers with the main opposition party are a few isolated, mostly freelance individuals within the media ecosystem. One independent-minded political reporter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AdamBienkov/status/1185829250768736256\" title=\"\">declared</a>: \u201cYou have to give credit to No 10 for knowing exactly how to play the UK press.\u201d But in truth, press outlets are not victims of their own gullibility, manipulated by clever mini-Machiavellis in No 10: they are willing and amenable. Their coverage is skewed to the political interests of the moguls who own the newspapers who \u2013 quite rationally \u2013 fear their economic position will be damaged by the far-reaching reforms that would be implemented after a Tory defeat.</p> <p>There is another factor that afflicts not just the print press, but the self-declared impartial broadcast media, too. Stenography \u2013 simply regurgitating the lines of the Tory political operation without analysis or context \u2013 is not political journalism. But Johnson\u2019s operation is offering access in exchange for just such pliant reporting. Those reporters who have attempted to genuinely scrutinise Johnson have found themselves frozen out. There is nothing new about this: it\u2019s how Alastair Campbell managed the media at New Labour\u2019s peak.</p> <p>That\u2019s not the end of the story, of course. While Labour\u2019s ability to push back at a Tory-crafted narrative is made extremely difficult by a press overwhelmingly sympathetic to the government\u2019s position \u2013 as the commentator Matt Zarb-Cousin puts it, being a Tory is playing politics on \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattzarb/status/1185701804551606277\" title=\"\">easy</a>\u201d mode \u2013 Labour\u2019s communication strategy is currently sorely lacking. The party has acted as though it was blindsided by Johnson\u2019s assumption of power, and it still lacks clear messages that cut through.</p> <p>Yet Labour needing to swiftly get its act together does not absolve the media of its systemic failings. On the brink of the most dramatic political upheaval for generations, we deserve thorough, intense scrutiny and a government held mercilessly to account. We are being denied that and \u2013 with it \u2013 a properly functioning democracy, too.</p> <p>\u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "A healthy democracy depends on an active citizenry which is able to make informed decisions. That is, in theory, the role of the fourth estate: to help the public understand their own society and the world around them, to hold the powerful to account and to challenge myths and expose uncomfortable truths. You do not need to be a long-time critic of the British media ecosystem to see those basic functions are not being satisfied when it comes to Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal. Rather than detailed scrutiny being applied to the most important single political event since the second world war, it has been reduced to a spectacle, a pantomime, all framed on the government\u2019s own terms. Just as Theresa May\u2019s \u201cno deal is better than a bad deal\u201d bluster collided with political reality, Johnson\u2019s demagoguery was followed by his own capitulation to the EU\u2019s red lines. Yet his embrace of a deal first offered by the EU 19 months ago \u2013 and rejected by May as something \u201cno UK prime minister could ever agree to\u201d \u2013 has been presented as an against-all-odds, critic-defying triumph. The consequences of a deal predicted to strip the country of \u00a3130bn worth of growth \u2013 making the average Briton \u00a32,250 a year poorer over the next 15 years \u2013 should be front and centre in the debate. Yet they are not. Johnson declared he would rather \u201cdie in a ditch\u201d than request an extension: but request one he did, and die in a ditch he did not. Yet most of the British press focused on the theatrics of the prime minister not signing a letter and sending a copy of the Benn act instead. This is, of course, exactly the framing the Tories desire. There are excellent, perceptive political reporters. But too much political reporting trivialises coverage of political events, reducing them to a crude soap opera, centred on personalities and tittle tattle, rather than explaining competing ideas or worldviews, or placing them in a broader social context. Drama takes priority over substance. It does help, of course, that the Tories have the active, partisan editorial support of most of the British press, while sympathisers with the main opposition party are a few isolated, mostly freelance individuals within the media ecosystem. One independent-minded political reporter declared: \u201cYou have to give credit to No 10 for knowing exactly how to play the UK press.\u201d But in truth, press outlets are not victims of their own gullibility, manipulated by clever mini-Machiavellis in No 10: they are willing and amenable. Their coverage is skewed to the political interests of the moguls who own the newspapers who \u2013 quite rationally \u2013 fear their economic position will be damaged by the far-reaching reforms that would be implemented after a Tory defeat. There is another factor that afflicts not just the print press, but the self-declared impartial broadcast media, too. Stenography \u2013 simply regurgitating the lines of the Tory political operation without analysis or context \u2013 is not political journalism. But Johnson\u2019s operation is offering access in exchange for just such pliant reporting. Those reporters who have attempted to genuinely scrutinise Johnson have found themselves frozen out. There is nothing new about this: it\u2019s how Alastair Campbell managed the media at New Labour\u2019s peak. That\u2019s not the end of the story, of course. While Labour\u2019s ability to push back at a Tory-crafted narrative is made extremely difficult by a press overwhelmingly sympathetic to the government\u2019s position \u2013 as the commentator Matt Zarb-Cousin puts it, being a Tory is playing politics on \u201ceasy\u201d mode \u2013 Labour\u2019s communication strategy is currently sorely lacking. The party has acted as though it was blindsided by Johnson\u2019s assumption of power, and it still lacks clear messages that cut through. Yet Labour needing to swiftly get its act together does not absolve the media of its systemic failings. On the brink of the most dramatic political upheaval for generations, we deserve thorough, intense scrutiny and a government held mercilessly to account. We are being denied that and \u2013 with it \u2013 a properly functioning democracy, too. \u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist",

In boxing you don\u2019t get paid overtime. So you want to get him out of there as soon as possible. You\u2019re not going in there just to tap and move. When you hit him, you want to hit him hard.

His name is not as widely known as it should be but the IBF champion is arguably the most skilful boxer in Britain. He also has a ruthless streak, and the calm way in which he speaks about hurting Prograis sounds ominous.</p> <p>Yet there is no doubting the compassion Taylor feels <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/19/patrick-day-boxing-death-tribute\" title=\"\">for Patrick Day</a>. The young American fighter still lay in a coma, after a brutal bout in Chicago, when Taylor and I met. He died a day after this interview, in another upsetting reminder that boxers really do risk their lives inside the ring. Taylor\u2019s sympathy for Day and his family is profound and, as he tells me a few days later, \u201cI\u2019m so sad that <a href=\"https://www.ringtv.com/580887-dibella-entertainment-statement-on-the-passing-of-patrick-day/\" title=\"\">Patrick lost his life</a>. He was just a year younger than me. It puts into perspective how dangerous our sport can be. I want to send my deepest sympathies to his family.\u201d</p> <p>He also makes it clear, again, that he has no wish to cause lasting damage to Prograis. But in such a hard fight, against the WBA champion, Taylor knows there is no point in sanitising the truth. Prograis is also intent on hurting him and, if Taylor is to prevail against the assured American, he needs to win a ferocious battle. Both men are in their prime. The 30-year-old Prograis has <a href=\"https://boxrec.com/en/proboxer/611370\" title=\"\">a perfect 24\u20110 record</a>. Taylor has <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">won all 15 of his fights</a>. Both have knocked out 80% of their opponents.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s definitely a good fighter,\u201d Taylor agrees. \u201cWe are the best two in the world in our division. But I\u2019m better than Prograis. I\u2019m going to prove that on Saturday night.\u201d</p> <p>This week will be testing. They have to meet each other twice more, at the press conference and the weigh-in, and there has been an edge to their previous encounters. Taylor shrugs it off. \u201cI\u2019m not bothered. He\u2019s not getting in my head. The only thing is that I\u2019m not very good in situations where you have to listen to a guy who talks about beating you up. The way I was brought up, if you have a problem with somebody you fight him there and then.</p> <p>\u201cIn Prestonpans [just outside Edinburgh] you didn\u2019t allow anyone to talk down to you. I was always smaller than everyone. People used to talk badly to me and verbally pick a fight. I would fight them straight away rather than say: \u2018Come outside and we\u2019ll settle it.\u2019 If I did that it would give away my size. So I quickly sorted them out. I\u2019ve seen a lot of Prograis during this tournament and the only thing I\u2019d be nervous about is losing my temper when I\u2019m in such close proximity to him.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/jun/04/barry-mcguigan-carl-frampton\" title=\"\">Barry McGuigan</a> and his son Shane, Taylor\u2019s manager and trainer respectively, will use all their experience to calm him. Taylor also insists he has seen chinks in Prograis\u2019s cool persona \u2013 despite his obvious respect.</p> <p>\u201cOf course we respect him. He\u2019s a world champion. But there\u2019s definitely no friendship. If anything, there\u2019s a bit of needle. He may be OK with me after the fight. But until then he\u2019s my arch enemy. He\u2019s not pissed me off. It\u2019s just annoying, because he\u2019s so cocky and arrogant. He thinks he\u2019s better than what he is because he\u2019s got a big entourage, telling him how great he is all the time. To me that shows a little insecurity. I don\u2019t need that.\u201d</p> <p>There is little to separate the two champions in their ring intelligence and will to win but Taylor points out: \u201cI\u2019m bigger than him. I\u2019m taller and with a longer reach. He\u2019s shorter and stockier than me. He might be a bit physically stronger than me. But I can handle that. I\u2019ve got speed and boxing ability over him. I\u2019ve got the reach. I\u2019ve got good timing and footwork. I\u2019ve fought better opponents. I just feel I\u2019ve got the beating of him.\u201d</p> <p>Taylor has been working hard at the McGuigans\u2019 impressive new facilities at the University of Kent in Canterbury \u2013 but does this fight feel more intense than any other? \u201cNot really. I\u2019m real focused and I\u2019ve had the longest camp of my career. This is probably my 15th week in training because the fight was postponed [while Prograis and the WBSS sorted out his contract]. It\u2019s meant I\u2019ve not killed my body. The buildup of fitness, power and strength has been gradual. It\u2019s felt like a smooth transition to peak fitness.\u201d</p> <p>Taylor\u2019s face only clouds with sadness when he remembers that, in July, <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/people/danika-mcguigan-obituary-accomplished-stage-and-screen-actor-1.3974670\" title=\"\">Danika McGuigan</a> died from cancer. The daughter of Barry and Sandra, and sister to Shane, Blain and Jake McGuigan, Danika was a gifted actor and only 33. \u201cIt was a real shock,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cDanika was a lovely girl. She was larger than life. She was real happy and positive about everything all the time.</p> <p>\u201cShe was always in a good mood, and she would talk to you and make you feel special. I couldn\u2019t imagine how it has been for Barry and Sandra having to bury a child. It\u2019s such a terrible loss.</p> <p>\u201cI hope that, for Barry and Shane, the boxing helps take their mind off it for a little while. In the gym with the lads, talking about boxing and working so hard, gives them a break from their loss. But we\u2019ll always remember Danika.\u201d</p> <p>Prograis loves books but Taylor, in contrast, reveres motorbikes. \u201cMy dream career was racing motorbikes. I was good at motocross. I was real competitive \u2013 getting top-threes in a field of 40 \u2013 and had one full season. But my parents couldn\u2019t afford it any more so I found boxing. I still love riding but I haven\u2019t been on a bike for two years because it\u2019s safer to put them away until after the boxing is over.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab5faf1d34f96716b1290320d86bbde3dfbc07df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab5faf1d34f96716b1290320d86bbde3dfbc07df/25_93_4789_2873/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Josh Taylor (right) prepares to swing his left at Ivan Baranchyk of Belarus at their World Boxing Super Series semi-final in Glasgow during May.

Of course it\u2019s incredibly dangerous. So I am in awe of the racers and I was lucky to meet some of them. We spent time with Lee Johnston, Hicky [Peter Hickman], Dean Harrison, John McGuinness.</p> <p>\u201cBut the best of them all, Michael Dunlop, was the sanest one. I was really surprised by how approachable Michael was. He <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/01/michael-dunlop-interview-tt-race-isle-of-man\" title=\"\">comes across as a bit grumpy</a> in the media. But he was real nice to me. He was actually in the middle of fixing his own bike when we went into his tent. He took a good half-hour away from his bike to talk to us. He was asking me about my boxing and all I wanted to ask about was his bike. He was real cool.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dunlop lost his father (Robert), his renowned uncle Joey and, more recently, his brother William to racing accidents. The TT might be even more dangerous than boxing \u2013 but being in the ring is more demanding than riding a bike.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t put your body through quite as much torture on a day-to-day basis on a bike,\u201d Taylor agrees. \u201cYou can come off your bike every single day and it could be over. But, as a boxer, you\u2019re punishing your body all the time. You feel it most during fight week. It doesn\u2019t help that you\u2019re cutting weight. We do it right but your body\u2019s still dry. You don\u2019t eat much. So the night before the weigh-in\u2019s always the longest and toughest. You\u2019re crabby with people. But as soon as you\u2019ve weighed in, you\u2019re rehydrated and got good food back in, you start to relax. It\u2019s time to have fun.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I can\u2019t wait for Progais. It\u2019s been a long camp gearing towards this point. This is the big one, the one that we want to win most. It\u2019s not going to be easy and there will be plenty of hurt \u2013 but I\u2019m looking forward to fighting, and winning.\u201d</p>",

Of course it\u2019s incredibly dangerous. So I am in awe of the racers and I was lucky to meet some of them. We spent time with Lee Johnston, Hicky [Peter Hickman], Dean Harrison, John McGuinness. \u201cBut the best of them all, Michael Dunlop, was the sanest one. I was really surprised by how approachable Michael was. He comes across as a bit grumpy in the media. But he was real nice to me. He was actually in the middle of fixing his own bike when we went into his tent. He took a good half-hour away from his bike to talk to us. He was asking me about my boxing and all I wanted to ask about was his bike. He was real cool.\u201d Dunlop lost his father (Robert), his renowned uncle Joey and, more recently, his brother William to racing accidents. The TT might be even more dangerous than boxing \u2013 but being in the ring is more demanding than riding a bike. \u201cYou don\u2019t put your body through quite as much torture on a day-to-day basis on a bike,\u201d Taylor agrees. \u201cYou can come off your bike every single day and it could be over. But, as a boxer, you\u2019re punishing your body all the time. You feel it most during fight week. It doesn\u2019t help that you\u2019re cutting weight. We do it right but your body\u2019s still dry. You don\u2019t eat much. So the night before the weigh-in\u2019s always the longest and toughest. You\u2019re crabby with people. But as soon as you\u2019ve weighed in, you\u2019re rehydrated and got good food back in, you start to relax. It\u2019s time to have fun. \u201cThat\u2019s why I can\u2019t wait for Progais. It\u2019s been a long camp gearing towards this point. This is the big one, the one that we want to win most. It\u2019s not going to be easy and there will be plenty of hurt \u2013 but I\u2019m looking forward to fighting, and winning.\u201d",

The solution is multi-sensory. \u201cCreating a pre-bedtime ritual, incorporating visual, physical or olfactory cues can be a good way to foster those feelings,\u201d she says. \u201cSo my most important tip is to find a routine that helps you to drift off and to stick to it.\u201d</p> <p>And it\u2019s not just about the 20 minutes before bedtime. \u201cFrom the moment you step through the door in the evening, start making the transition from the busyness of the day to a relaxed state that\u2019s ready for sleep,\u201d says Ramlakhan. \u201cThere are a few small tricks that can be incorporated into anyone\u2019s evening, no matter how busy.\u201d</p> <p>But where do you start? \u201cLighting is paramount,\u201d says Ramlakhan.

      "body": "<p>Friends and colleagues have responded to the death of the journalist and author Deborah Orr with a flood of tributes, describing the longtime Guardian columnist as fearless, hilarious, and \u201ca lioness in a world full of mogs\u201d.</p> <p>Orr, who died from cancer at the age of 57, had a long and varied journalistic career at the Guardian, the Independent, and the i newspaper, among others. Her memoir about her upbringing in Scotland, Motherwell: a Girlhood, is due to be published next year.</p> <p>After the news of her death emerged, Jenny Lord, Orr\u2019s publisher at W&amp;N, said in a statement: \u201cTo say we are devastated by the loss of this most remarkable of women \u2013 an intellectual force, a writer whose life and career has most certainly been cut short far too soon \u2013 is the wildest understatement.</p> <p>\u201cDeborah was a writer we had all admired long before we became her publisher. With her unrivalled ability to stare at something (sometimes someone) right in the eye, she was an inspiration as well as an exceptional writer.\u201d</p> <p>Lord said her editorial input on Orr\u2019s forthcoming memoir centred largely around \u201casking her for more; and more and more\u201d and said it became clear that the work should be the first book of many.</p> <p>\u201cHer voice, so sharp, deliciously spiky, crystalline and true. Her dialogue, so precise yet so easy,\u201d said Lord. \u201cIf she was born to write this incredible memoir, this reckoning that it turned out was bubbling away under the surface for so long, she was surely also born to write fiction. It is grossly unfair for all of us that those future books will have to remain unwritten.\u201d</p> <p>Suzanne Moore, Orr\u2019s close friend and a Guardian columnist, responded to expressions of sympathy about her death on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/suzanne_moore/status/1186037676547497984\">by writing</a>: \u201cThank you for the many kind messages and thoughts about my brilliant friend Deborah Orr. Never could get that woman off the dance floor \u2026 so many tales to tell. One day. Gather close, raise a glass and live and love as fiercely as she did. I loved her.\u201d</p> <p>The Guardian\u2019s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, described her as \u201ca brilliant, clever, funny journalist whose work was an important part of the Guardian for many years\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe Guardian Weekend magazine she edited in the 1990s was the home of brilliant writing and many of Britain\u2019s best writers loved working for her,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cAs a columnist Deborah was knowledgable, insightful and uncompromising. She was greatly respected by many people, who will mourn her death, especially at such a young age.\u201d</p> <p>Hadley Freeman, a Guardian columnist and feature writer, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HadleyFreeman/status/1186019550749511680\">said</a> Orr was a \u201cfearless and thoughtful, cutting and compassionate\u201d writer. \u201cAs a friend, she was loyal, loving, fun, hilarious and kind,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThe saddest news. Formidable, magnificent and funny as hell,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mariellaf1/status/1186177162103152641\">tweeted the journalist and broadcaster</a> Mariella Frostrup. \u201cShe was a lioness in a world full of mogs.\u201d</p> <p>Orr\u2019s literary agent, Clare Conville, described her as a brilliantly acute journalist and a groundbreaking magazine editor. \u201cWhen I first suggested she write a book 12 years ago she roared with laughter and replied, \u2018I have nothing to say.\u2019 Unusually for Deborah she proved herself wrong,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cHer memoir when it finally came was astonishing. Painful and revealing in parts, joyful in others. A tour de force of the form itself. Even when mortally ill we discussed her next book, a novel. \u2018It\u2019s writing itself in my head.\u2019\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/oct/21/deborah-orr-obituary\">Deborah Orr obituary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Conville added: \u201cHer loss to her children Ivan and Luther, her stepchildren Alexis and Madeleine and her many friends who adored her is incalculable.\u201d</p> <p>Simon Kelner, her editor at the Independent, <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/opinion/deborah-orr-columnist-fearless-audacious-817490\">remembered</a> that Orr had once stunned the rightwing columnist Bruce Anderson by throwing a glass of red wine over him in retaliation after he proffered \u201csome pretty extreme views\u201d at a dinner.</p> <p>\u201cWe were all either outraged or embarrassed, but only Debs had the courage of her convictions,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>And he said: \u201cOf the many adjectives that will be used about her, the one that most accurately describes her is fearless.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Friends and colleagues have responded to the death of the journalist and author Deborah Orr with a flood of tributes, describing the longtime Guardian columnist as fearless, hilarious, and \u201ca lioness in a world full of mogs\u201d. Orr, who died from cancer at the age of 57, had a long and varied journalistic career at the Guardian, the Independent, and the i newspaper, among others. Her memoir about her upbringing in Scotland, Motherwell: a Girlhood, is due to be published next year. After the news of her death emerged, Jenny Lord, Orr\u2019s publisher at W&amp;N, said in a statement: \u201cTo say we are devastated by the loss of this most remarkable of women \u2013 an intellectual force, a writer whose life and career has most certainly been cut short far too soon \u2013 is the wildest understatement. \u201cDeborah was a writer we had all admired long before we became her publisher. With her unrivalled ability to stare at something (sometimes someone) right in the eye, she was an inspiration as well as an exceptional writer.\u201d Lord said her editorial input on Orr\u2019s forthcoming memoir centred largely around \u201casking her for more; and more and more\u201d and said it became clear that the work should be the first book of many. \u201cHer voice, so sharp, deliciously spiky, crystalline and true. Her dialogue, so precise yet so easy,\u201d said Lord. \u201cIf she was born to write this incredible memoir, this reckoning that it turned out was bubbling away under the surface for so long, she was surely also born to write fiction. It is grossly unfair for all of us that those future books will have to remain unwritten.\u201d Suzanne Moore, Orr\u2019s close friend and a Guardian columnist, responded to expressions of sympathy about her death on Twitter by writing: \u201cThank you for the many kind messages and thoughts about my brilliant friend Deborah Orr. Never could get that woman off the dance floor \u2026 so many tales to tell. One day. Gather close, raise a glass and live and love as fiercely as she did. I loved her.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, described her as \u201ca brilliant, clever, funny journalist whose work was an important part of the Guardian for many years\u201d. \u201cThe Guardian Weekend magazine she edited in the 1990s was the home of brilliant writing and many of Britain\u2019s best writers loved working for her,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a columnist Deborah was knowledgable, insightful and uncompromising. She was greatly respected by many people, who will mourn her death, especially at such a young age.\u201d Hadley Freeman, a Guardian columnist and feature writer, said Orr was a \u201cfearless and thoughtful, cutting and compassionate\u201d writer. \u201cAs a friend, she was loyal, loving, fun, hilarious and kind,\u201d she said. \u201cThe saddest news. Formidable, magnificent and funny as hell,\u201d tweeted the journalist and broadcaster Mariella Frostrup. \u201cShe was a lioness in a world full of mogs.\u201d Orr\u2019s literary agent, Clare Conville, described her as a brilliantly acute journalist and a groundbreaking magazine editor. \u201cWhen I first suggested she write a book 12 years ago she roared with laughter and replied, \u2018I have nothing to say.\u2019 Unusually for Deborah she proved herself wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cHer memoir when it finally came was astonishing. Painful and revealing in parts, joyful in others. A tour de force of the form itself. Even when mortally ill we discussed her next book, a novel. \u2018It\u2019s writing itself in my head.\u2019\u201d Conville added: \u201cHer loss to her children Ivan and Luther, her stepchildren Alexis and Madeleine and her many friends who adored her is incalculable.\u201d Simon Kelner, her editor at the Independent, remembered that Orr had once stunned the rightwing columnist Bruce Anderson by throwing a glass of red wine over him in retaliation after he proffered \u201csome pretty extreme views\u201d at a dinner. \u201cWe were all either outraged or embarrassed, but only Debs had the courage of her convictions,\u201d he wrote. And he said: \u201cOf the many adjectives that will be used about her, the one that most accurately describes her is fearless.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>When Paula Sherriff stood up in the House of Commons two weeks ago to beg Boris Johnson to moderate his \u201coffensive, dangerous, inflammatory\u201d language, she took herself by surprise. \u201cI know it sounds bizarre, but I didn\u2019t even brush my hair,\u201d she says. She had gone into the chamber intending to listen to the prime minister\u2019s statement \u2013 this was the day after the prorogation of parliament was ruled unlawful. But as Johnson spoke, she felt the anxiety intensify in her corner of the Commons.</p> <p>\u201cI was sitting among female MPs. We were getting irritated. Agitated,\u201d she says. She must feel it now, too, because she has started to fidget in her seat, in her office in Westminster. \u201cWe were saying: \u2018This is what\u2019s going to be in our inboxes tomorrow!\u201d Every time he said: \u2018Surrender\u2019, we were getting more and more \u2026 \u201d she squirms, her arms jostling with the elbows of imaginary neighbours.</p> <p>So she went to see the Speaker, who told her: \u201cPaula, I\u2019m entirely sympathetic,\u201d but there would be no points of order during Johnson\u2019s statement. \u201cI said: \u2018Could I shoehorn it into a question?\u2019, and he said, \u2018Absolutely!\u2019 He was unequivocal.\u201d</p> <p>He called her quickly. \u201cI remember thinking: \u2018Oh, shit!\u2019 when I heard my name. I stood up.\u201d That\u2019s when, in a voice breaking with emotion, she told Johnson how the death threats she and her colleagues received often quoted him. \u201cIt came from the heart.\u201d </p> <p>Immediately, the abuse focused on her. Sherriff rattles off a list: \u201cYou were shrieking like a fish wife\u201d; \u201cYou fat bitch\u201d; \u201cStupid cow\u201d and \u201cI won\u2019t be happy till you\u2019re hanging from a lamppost.\u201d</p> <p>Much of it focuses on her weight. She looks down at her iPad and reads an email from a constituent. \u201cI have some advice for Paula Sherriff. If you can\u2019t stand the heat stay out of the kitchen. And if the photo on the front of last week\u2019s [local paper] is anything to go by, the kitchen should be out of bounds for Miss Sherriff.\u201d</p> <p>Coming from the heart is very much Sherriff\u2019s approach to politics. \u201cI\u2019m a heckler,\u201d she says. Before she became an MP she used to think members were like animals and the House of Commons a zoo. \u201cI always said I wouldn\u2019t do it. But there is something about being in there and getting carried away.\u201d She is reflecting on her own behaviour, but it must seem punishing that her passion is provoking the kind of abuse to which she is so opposed.</p> <p>Ever since she was a girl, Sherriff, 44, says, she \u201calways believed in speaking out\u201d, but now the urge is taut with the fear that lives are at stake.<strong> </strong>She became an MP in 2015, the same time as Jo Cox.<strong> </strong>Her Yorkshire constituency of Dewsbury borders Batley &amp; Spen, where Cox was killed by the far-right extremist Thomas Mair, in June 2016. The library where Cox was attacked is only three or four miles out of the corner of Sherriff\u2019s eye. Do MPs fear another murder? \u201cYes, I think they do. And I don\u2019t want to look back and think: \u2018I could have said something, and I didn\u2019t \u2013 and now we\u2019ve lost another colleague.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, she has had CCTV installed, and alarms. \u201cAnd you know, in your heart of hearts, that the vast majority of people who send these messages have no intention of following up. They say they want you hanging from a tree,\u201d she says, making an effort at nonchalance, \u201cbut they\u2019re not actually going to come and grab you and kidnap you.\u201d</p> <p>She tries to be rational. But still, \u201cthere\u2019s that little seed at the back of your mind\u201d. She mentions the Labour MP Rosie Cooper: in May, a member of the neo-Nazi group National Action was found guilty of plotting to murder her. \u201cSometimes I come home at midnight.<strong> </strong><strong> </strong>There are times I put the key in the door, walk in, turn the alarm off. You get that little moment. Is someone going to jump out at me?\u201d It used to be that she could leave her house and go to the corner shop, all without looking over her shoulder. But not any more. She looks. \u201cAbsolutely, constantly.\u201d</p> <p>In some ways, Sherriff is still looking over her shoulder at that day in June 2016 when her office manager, Karen Rowling \u2013 who is busy at the next desk \u2013 phoned to ask if she had heard anything.</p> <p>Sherriff was enjoying a rare lie-in, having got home from work at 2am. When the phone rang at lunchtime, she assumed that Rowling was pestering her to get a move on.</p> <p>\u201cI said: \u2018I\u2019m coming! I\u2019m just straightening my hair!\u2019\u201d But a friend of Karen\u2019s had been in the pub with colleagues of Cox. One was called away suddenly; there was a rumour that she had been shot. \u201cI said to Karen: \u2018Don\u2019t be daft!\u2019 We were quite dismissive, weren\u2019t we?\u2019\u201d Sherriff says, turning to Rowling. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s not London or Manchester or Birmingham. It\u2019s quite sleepy.\u201d</p> <p>Feeling \u201ca bit stupid\u201d for troubling him, Sherriff phoned the Kirklees chief superintendent. She was sure he wouldn\u2019t answer if something was going on. So when he picked up, she momentarily relaxed. But then he asked her where she was. \u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019m at home.\u2019 He said: \u2018Can I ask you to stay indoors?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>They shut the office; sent everyone home. \u201cYou came to my house, didn\u2019t you, Karen?\u201d Sherriff says. \u201cYou kept shouting at me to get away from the windows. I was just pacing. We waited.\u201d</p> <p>At 4pm Louise Haigh, the MP for Sheffield, called with the news that Cox had died. \u201cI remember walking into the back bedroom of my house and she was crying. I was crying. We were in shock. I stayed at Karen\u2019s house that night. We shared a bed, didn\u2019t we?\u201d Sherriff says over her shoulder. \u201cI remember waking in the morning and saying: \u2018Did it happen?\u2019 It felt surreal. Just devastating.\u201d</p> <p>Sherriff\u2019s recollections are granular and specific, focused on the small moments \u2013 straightening her hair, the back bedroom, the shared bed \u2013 as if the brightness setting in her memory of the entire day is switched to maximum. \u201cThat day changed everything,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a92e4cd03efef7588bc68108f6f5469db8480746\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a92e4cd03efef7588bc68108f6f5469db8480746/0_125_2992_1795/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paula Sherriff leave St Peters Church in the town of Birstall, West Yorkshire, where a vigil was held for murdered Labour MP Jo Cox.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paula Sherriff leave St Peters Church in the town of Birstall, West Yorkshire, where a vigil was held for murdered Labour MP Jo Cox.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Hinchliffe/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After working in prosecutions in the police force for 10 years after she left school, Sherriff thought she \u201cknew a lot about murder\u201d, but the killing of Cox is so far outside her experience, she is unsure if what she feels is \u201cjust natural\u201d given the extraordinary circumstances, or beyond the range of normal recovery. \u201cA senior officer did suggest to us a few months ago that we have post-traumatic stress,\u201d Sherriff says. \u201cI don\u2019t know, is the answer.\u201d</p> <p>It is in this context that Johnson\u2019s dismissal of her complaint as \u201chumbug\u201d and his assertion that \u201cthe best way to honour Jo Cox is to get Brexit done\u201d feels so painful. \u201cHe argues that he wasn\u2019t referring to what I said as humbug. But surely he would have sent me a little note? Or asked for a meeting? You can even do an apology that\u2019s not really an apology: \u2018I\u2019m sorry if you were under the impression \u2026\u2019 But to dismiss me like some sort of hysterical female \u2026 I just think, that is the measure of the man. There are times I still can\u2019t believe he is our prime minister.It absolutely horrifies me.\u201d</p> <p>In contrast, within the hour Jeremy Corbyn texted her personally to ask: \u201c\u2018Are you OK? Do you need any support?\u2019 He looked me up the following day and gave me a hug.\u201d Sherriff is \u201cnot one of those who thinks everything Corbyn does is amazing\u201d. She has twice voted against him as Labour leader. But, she says, he has \u201ccompassion, a sense of right and wrong.\u201d</p> <p>The parallels between Cox\u2019s death and the current climate are inescapable for Sheriff. Like Cox, she is a remain-supporting MP in a leave area. Her seat is marginal and she has wrestled with this sense of being at odds with her constituents. \u201cI wrestled with it hugely! For a while, I believed we should respect the result,\u201d she says. She regrets that she voted to trigger article 50. \u201cIt became clear how damaging [Brexit would be]. And I just couldn\u2019t support the shitshow. I don\u2019t feel I am disrespecting the result by saying: \u2018Put it back to the people.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>When the general election comes, she hopes her strong work ethic will convince voters to support her.</p> <p>\u201cWhen Jo died,\u201d she says, faltering, \u201cit was almost a similar time. Tensions were very high. There was a very divisive undercurrent in the nation.\u201d Three months earlier, the now-defunct far-right group Britain First had visited Dewsbury town centre. A few days before Sherriff and I meet, the far-right group Yorkshire Patriots demonstrated in the same place.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m quite interested in the psychology of why these people feel so much hatred,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause I was brought up in a really normal family. I\u2019m really lucky. I had a particularly loving mum.\u201d She mentions the many messages of support she received, along with the abuse and death threats. \u201cOne moved me to tears. It said: \u2018I hope my granddaughters grow up to be like you.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Sherriff\u2019s politics have very much been filtered through the women of her family. She was born near Glasgow (her mother is Glaswegian, of Lithuanian and Polish parents). But the family moved to Greater Manchester when she was a baby, then Cumbria, and later \u201ca very modest area of Harrogate\u201d. Her dad was a submariner in the forces, \u201caway for months at a time\u201d and she didn\u2019t really know him growing up.</p> <p>But her mum, Barbara, had \u201cvery strong attitudes about social justice\u201d. She cuts stories of social injustice out of the local paper and keeps them in a folder in the living room, dying for Tory canvassers to knock on her door. She is \u201creally feisty\u201d. Sherriff\u2019s grandmothers \u2013 perhaps like the one who wrote to her \u2013 were \u201cstrong influences\u201d, and I suspect the word \u201cstrong\u201d keeps cropping up because Sherriff sees herself that way, too.</p> <p>Both grandmothers were staunch Labour. Stauuunch,\u201d Sherriff says, as if the normal pronunciation doesn\u2019t begin to cover the extent of it. This drives Sherriff\u2019s work \u2013 and perhaps that of her sister Lee, too, who also stood for election in 2015, in Cumbria, but didn\u2019t get in. Sherriff and her mother speak daily. And although Barbara, who used to work in Woolworths, \u201cdoesn\u2019t quite grasp how much I work\u201d \u2013 they\u2019ll be sitting in Sherriff\u2019s house and her mum will say: \u2018Have you washed those windows?\u2019 \u2013 she is supportive.Sherriff has a strongly autobiographical approach to public office. She joined the police after leaving school at 18 with five A-levels and an alphabet of grades - an A, B, C, D and an E (\u201cIt\u2019s fabulous, isn\u2019t it!\u201d). She could have done better but boys and nightclubs were more interesting. After the police came a job in the NHS, as service manager for Wakefield community dermatology service. It\u2019s easy to see the continuity between her personal life and her political interests.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6fd0f5a1e4c513c3255c9cf60f9fd4d6eeb5a22c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fd0f5a1e4c513c3255c9cf60f9fd4d6eeb5a22c/0_0_2200_1319/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paula Sherriff questioning the prime minister on his use of language in the House of Commons.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paula Sherriff questioning the prime minister on his use of language in the House of Commons.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HO/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sherriff chairs the all-party parliamentary group on women\u2019s health. Within months of becoming an MP, she campaigned against the so-called \u201ctampon tax\u201d, becoming the first backbencher in parliamentary history to get an amendment to a Budget resolution adopted. It was the tampon tax that nearly derailed Johnson\u2019s EU deal. But \u201cit was never about the 5p in the pound,\u201d she says (the rate to which tax on tampons was lowered as a result of her efforts). \u201cIt was about the fact that periods were considered luxuries. And it was about talking about vaginas in the House of Commons.\u201d</p> <p>Vaginas crop up quite a bit in Sherriff\u2019s work. \u201cI want to use my time in this place to talk about things that have previously been considered taboo,\u201d she says. \u201cNothing is off-limits for me.\u201d</p> <p>Period poverty, workplace protections for women undergoing the menopause and endometriosis \u2013 \u201ca subject close to my heart\u201d \u2013 are all in her sights. Sherriff herself waited more than a decade to be diagnosed with \u201cnot endometriosis as such, but something very similar\u201d, and once fainted in the supermarket with the pain of it. She dreaded being treated in the hospital where she worked because she \u201cdidn\u2019t want to be showing my fanny to [a] guy I might see in the canteen\u201d. But in the end, she did \u2013 and he cured her. Anyway, it wouldn\u2019t bother her now, she says.</p> <p>The treatment came at a price, however, triggering a chemical menopause when she was 37. \u201cIt was either that or a hysterectomy, and I still harboured hopes of having children,\u201d she says. Luckily, the menopause \u201cwasn\u2019t too bad\u201d.</p> <p>But the children didn\u2019t come. \u201cSadly. I\u2019d have loved to,\u201d she says, and I wonder if this is another reason that the appreciative note from an unknown grandmother was so moving. \u201cI\u2019d have loved a daughter. And I would have had the most feminist daughter. She would have been a little warrior. She would have been out with Extinction Rebellion.\u201d She knows so much about this little girl; she sounds very much alive.</p> <p>Sherriff looks around the room. There are trees in the atrium below, and a stall selling a House of Commons Christmas jumper. To someone whose \u201creally poor school\u201d never arranged trips to the Houses of Parliament, this place must have come as a huge shock. At first, she felt like an outsider. She puts on a posh voice. \u201c\u2018Oh, which university did you go to? I worked as so-and-so\u2019s spad.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>But at 40, she was old enough to feel comfortable in herself, and in her politics. And besides, she had the advantage of a different experience. \u201cI felt really well equipped to deal with people,\u201d she says. \u201cThat has always been my strength.\u201d</p>",

I was crying. We were in shock. I stayed at Karen\u2019s house that night. We shared a bed, didn\u2019t we?\u201d Sherriff says over her shoulder. \u201cI remember waking in the morning and saying: \u2018Did it happen?\u2019 It felt surreal. Just devastating.\u201d Sherriff\u2019s recollections are granular and specific, focused on the small moments \u2013 straightening her hair, the back bedroom, the shared bed \u2013 as if the brightness setting in her memory of the entire day is switched to maximum. \u201cThat day changed everything,\u201d she says. After working in prosecutions in the police force for 10 years after she left school, Sherriff thought she \u201cknew a lot about murder\u201d, but the killing of Cox is so far outside her experience, she is unsure if what she feels is \u201cjust natural\u201d given the extraordinary circumstances, or beyond the range of normal recovery. \u201cA senior officer did suggest to us a few months ago that we have post-traumatic stress,\u201d Sherriff says. \u201cI don\u2019t know, is the answer.\u201d It is in this context that Johnson\u2019s dismissal of her complaint as \u201chumbug\u201d and his assertion that \u201cthe best way to honour Jo Cox is to get Brexit done\u201d feels so painful. \u201cHe argues that he wasn\u2019t referring to what I said as humbug. But surely he would have sent me a little note? Or asked for a meeting? You can even do an apology that\u2019s not really an apology: \u2018I\u2019m sorry if you were under the impression \u2026\u2019 But to dismiss me like some sort of hysterical female \u2026 I just think, that is the measure of the man. There are times I still can\u2019t believe he is our prime minister.It absolutely horrifies me.\u201d In contrast, within the hour Jeremy Corbyn texted her personally to ask: \u201c\u2018Are you OK? Do you need any support?\u2019 He looked me up the following day and gave me a hug.\u201d Sherriff is \u201cnot one of those who thinks everything Corbyn does is amazing\u201d. She has twice voted against him as Labour leader. But, she says, he has \u201ccompassion, a sense of right and wrong.\u201d The parallels between Cox\u2019s death and the current climate are inescapable for Sheriff. Like Cox, she is a remain-supporting MP in a leave area. Her seat is marginal and she has wrestled with this sense of being at odds with her constituents. \u201cI wrestled with it hugely! For a while, I believed we should respect the result,\u201d she says. She regrets that she voted to trigger article 50. \u201cIt became clear how damaging [Brexit would be]. And I just couldn\u2019t support the shitshow. I don\u2019t feel I am disrespecting the result by saying: \u2018Put it back to the people.\u2019\u201d When the general election comes, she hopes her strong work ethic will convince voters to support her. \u201cWhen Jo died,\u201d she says, faltering, \u201cit was almost a similar time. Tensions were very high. There was a very divisive undercurrent in the nation.\u201d Three months earlier, the now-defunct far-right group Britain First had visited Dewsbury town centre. A few days before Sherriff and I meet, the far-right group Yorkshire Patriots demonstrated in the same place. \u201cI\u2019m quite interested in the psychology of why these people feel so much hatred,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause I was brought up in a really normal family. I\u2019m really lucky. I had a particularly loving mum.\u201d She mentions the many messages of support she received, along with the abuse and death threats. \u201cOne moved me to tears. It said: \u2018I hope my granddaughters grow up to be like you.\u2019\u201d Sherriff\u2019s politics have very much been filtered through the women of her family. She was born near Glasgow (her mother is Glaswegian, of Lithuanian and Polish parents). But the family moved to Greater Manchester when she was a baby, then Cumbria, and later \u201ca very modest area of Harrogate\u201d. Her dad was a submariner in the forces, \u201caway for months at a time\u201d and she didn\u2019t really know him growing up. But her mum, Barbara, had \u201cvery strong attitudes about social justice\u201d. She cuts stories of social injustice out of the local paper and keeps them in a folder in the living room, dying for Tory canvassers to knock on her door. She is \u201creally feisty\u201d. Sherriff\u2019s grandmothers \u2013 perhaps like the one who wrote to her \u2013 were \u201cstrong influences\u201d, and I suspect the word \u201cstrong\u201d keeps cropping up because Sherriff sees herself that way, too. Both grandmothers were staunch Labour. Stauuunch,\u201d Sherriff says, as if the normal pronunciation doesn\u2019t begin to cover the extent of it. This drives Sherriff\u2019s work \u2013 and perhaps that of her sister Lee, too, who also stood for election in 2015, in Cumbria, but didn\u2019t get in. Sherriff and her mother speak daily. And although Barbara, who used to work in Woolworths, \u201cdoesn\u2019t quite grasp how much I work\u201d \u2013 they\u2019ll be sitting in Sherriff\u2019s house and her mum will say: \u2018Have you washed those windows?\u2019 \u2013 she is supportive.Sherriff has a strongly autobiographical approach to public office. She joined the police after leaving school at 18 with five A-levels and an alphabet of grades - an A, B, C, D and an E (\u201cIt\u2019s fabulous, isn\u2019t it!\u201d). She could have done better but boys and nightclubs were more interesting. After the police came a job in the NHS, as service manager for Wakefield community dermatology service. It\u2019s easy to see the continuity between her personal life and her political interests. Sherriff chairs the all-party parliamentary group on women\u2019s health. Within months of becoming an MP, she campaigned against the so-called \u201ctampon tax\u201d, becoming the first backbencher in parliamentary history to get an amendment to a Budget resolution adopted. It was the tampon tax that nearly derailed Johnson\u2019s EU deal. But \u201cit was never about the 5p in the pound,\u201d she says (the rate to which tax on tampons was lowered as a result of her efforts). \u201cIt was about the fact that periods were considered luxuries. And it was about talking about vaginas in the House of Commons.\u201d Vaginas crop up quite a bit in Sherriff\u2019s work. \u201cI want to use my time in this place to talk about things that have previously been considered taboo,\u201d she says. \u201cNothing is off-limits for me.\u201d Period poverty, workplace protections for women undergoing the menopause and endometriosis \u2013 \u201ca subject close to my heart\u201d \u2013 are all in her sights. Sherriff herself waited more than a decade to be diagnosed with \u201cnot endometriosis as such, but something very similar\u201d, and once fainted in the supermarket with the pain of it. She dreaded being treated in the hospital where she worked because she \u201cdidn\u2019t want to be showing my fanny to [a] guy I might see in the canteen\u201d. But in the end, she did \u2013 and he cured her. Anyway, it wouldn\u2019t bother her now, she says. The treatment came at a price, however, triggering a chemical menopause when she was 37. \u201cIt was either that or a hysterectomy, and I still harboured hopes of having children,\u201d she says. Luckily, the menopause \u201cwasn\u2019t too bad\u201d. But the children didn\u2019t come. \u201cSadly. I\u2019d have loved to,\u201d she says, and I wonder if this is another reason that the appreciative note from an unknown grandmother was so moving. \u201cI\u2019d have loved a daughter. And I would have had the most feminist daughter. She would have been a little warrior. She would have been out with Extinction Rebellion.\u201d She knows so much about this little girl; she sounds very much alive. Sherriff looks around the room. There are trees in the atrium below, and a stall selling a House of Commons Christmas jumper. To someone whose \u201creally poor school\u201d never arranged trips to the Houses of Parliament, this place must have come as a huge shock. At first, she felt like an outsider. She puts on a posh voice. \u201c\u2018Oh, which university did you go to? I worked as so-and-so\u2019s spad.\u2019\u201d But at 40, she was old enough to feel comfortable in herself, and in her politics. And besides, she had the advantage of a different experience. \u201cI felt really well equipped to deal with people,\u201d she says. \u201cThat has always been my strength.\u201d",

Teva Pharmaceuticals, the largest manufacturer of generic drugs in the world, and three drug distributors, among the biggest corporations in America, are to pay a total of $260m to settle the first of thousands of lawsuits by communities across the US which accuse the industry of creating an epidemic that that has claimed more than 400,000 lives over the past two decades. Monday\u2019s trial in Ohio was intended to help establish whether opioid makers, drug distributors and pharmacy chains are liable to pay out billions to more than 2,700 cities, counties and Native American tribes. Other trials are scheduled in the coming months if a comprehensive deal involving all parties is not reached. Talks over a total payout of about $50bn stalled on Friday but lawyers said Monday\u2019s settlement may provide a path to an agreement. The Ohio lawsuit was brought by two counties, Cuyahoga and Summit, using anti-racketeering laws, originally written to go after organised crime. The counties claimed that manufacturers of narcotic painkillers aggressively drove up sales with knowingly false claims that they were less addictive and more effective than they were, leading to a huge surge in prescribing and addiction. They also alleged that distributors and pharmacies ignored legal obligations to restrict delivery and dispensing of the drugs, even as the death toll escalated, because they were making so much money. Eileen Shapiro, the Summit county executive, said the lawsuit was intended to prevent drug companies flooding the area with opioids which \u201cdevastated\u201d communities and created a surge in illegal opioids led by heroin and fentanyl. \u201cWe started this originally to stop the behaviours,\u201d she said. \u201cEnough is enough.\u201d The two counties were suing for a total of $7bn.

The Walgreens pharmacy chain did not settle. Its case will be joined with other pharmacies, including Walmart and CVS, at a separate trial. In the weeks leading up to the trial several opioid makers reached settlements, including Johnson &amp; Johnson which lost a major trial in Oklahoma in August when a judge found the company\u2019s drive to sell opioids with false claims caused addiction and death. Opioid makers and distributors have paid out hundreds of millions of dollars to settle federal cases accusing them of failing to obey laws about cutting off opioid deliveries to pharmacies dispensing suspiciously large amounts of prescription painkillers. But the firms made no admission of liability. Lawyers believe the industry is keen to avoid trials which will expose internal decision-making around the marketing, sale and delivery of opioids, and how much executives ignored evidence of rising addiction from prescription painkillers. \u201cWe now know from discovery in this case how this industry worked,\u201d said one of the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys, Joe Rice.

Clegg said he had slept with 30 women, didn\u2019t he? Well \u2026 kind of. That notorious \u201cfact\u201d came from a GQ interview with Piers Morgan in 2008. OK. Morgan asked Clegg: \u201cHow many are we talking: 10, 20, 30?\u201d To which Clegg said: \u201cNo more than 30.\u201d Morgan: \u201cSo there are 30 women out there who could answer the question?\u201d Clegg: \u201cIt\u2019s a lot less than that.\u201d So he actually claimed he had slept with fewer than 30 women? I\u2019m afraid so. Are there no womanisers left in the world? I\u2019m sure they exist, although it is thankfully out of fashion to talk about it with such gusto. There\u2019s always the PM, I suppose. Ah, yes, a man with a long and tangled sexual history. How many women has he slept with? I doubt that anybody knows that. And it\u2019s likely that he will be as honest about that as he was about Brexit. Do say: \u201cHey there. Haven\u2019t we met before?\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cHey there. I\u2019ve only had sex twice so far today, will you help me meet my target?\u201d",

The group, called Predator Exposure, confronted two men on separate occasions after they had taken part in online chats with their members posing as teenagers. One of the men was held in a headlock and physically dragged out of a shop against his will, Leeds crown court heard, while confrontations were live-streamed on social media. Tom Storey, prosecuting, told the court: \u201cThe members of this group, and those working with them, overstepped the mark and went far beyond the bounds within which they should have operated.\u201d The six defendants deny the charges of false imprisonment and assault and claim they were making lawful citizen\u2019s arrests. The first incident happened in August 2018, when four of the defendants went to the home of a man who had taken part in online conversations with a Predator Exposure member posing as a 14-year-old. They took the man, who was diagnosed with ADHD as a child and is believed to be on the autistic spectrum, into the back garden of the house and prevented him from leaving, even when he asked to be allowed inside to fetch his medication, the court heard. One of the defendants, Phillip Hoban, 43, can be heard on footage taken by the group calling the man a \u201cfilthy cunt\u201d and asking him if he would prefer to be called \u201ca nonce or a dirty bastard\u201d, the jury was told. The second incident took place in January 2019 when five of the defendants went to the home of another man and chased him to a nearby shop before some tried to physically drag him outside. After the man was \u201cbundled\u201d outside the shop, Hoban physically held on to his clothing while calling him a \u201cdirty, horrible bastard\u201d, a \u201cchild rapist\u201d and an \u201canimal\u201d, the jury heard. Both men were arrested on suspicion of inciting a child to engage in sexual activity. However, the court heard that although the prosecution accepts that their activity did amount to criminal offences, neither of them was charged. Hoban and his son, Jordan McDonald, 19, both from Leeds, are both charged with two counts of false imprisonment and one of common assault.

      "bodyText": "If one in five people in richer countries adopted low-meat diets, and threw away a third less food than they currently do, while poor countries were assisted to preserve their forests and restore degraded land, the world\u2019s agricultural systems could be absorbing carbon dioxide by 2050 instead of adding massively to global heating as they do at present. Tree-planting and improving the fertility of soil through better farming practices would also be needed, according to a study of global forests, farming and food systems published in the journal Nature Climate Change. Managing agricultural and other land in a more environmentally sound manner could take the world nearly a third of the way towards meeting the Paris agreement goals. \u201cThese [measures] are feasible now and deliver many other benefits,\u201d said Stephanie Roe, environmental scientist at the University of Virginia and lead author of the paper. \u201cRecent reports on the state of our forests and food systems show a worrying lack of progress in the land sector, and our window of opportunity to deliver on the Paris agreement is getting smaller. However, I remain optimistic because we have all the tools we need, as well as increasing public pressure and political will to turn things around.\u201d The changes would also allow for healthier diets globally, improve livelihoods in poor areas, preserve wildlife and flora, and make for higher water and air quality. Many of the measures suggested, such as cutting food waste and shifting from excessive meat consumption, would also save money. For example, improving soil management through organic farming practices would cost about $57bn (\u00a343.9bn) but save nearly $2tn over the period, according to one estimate used in the study. Land accounts for about 25% of global greenhouse gas emissions, or 11 gigatons of carbon dioxide a year.

That could give some scope for other sectors such as aviation to continue to use limited amounts of fossil fuels while staying within the global carbon budget needed to avoid a temperature rise of more than 1.5C (a rise of 2.7F) above pre-industrial levels. The authors set out a roadmap for the six large-scale measures they propose, including: reducing deforestation, peatland burning and mangrove destruction by 70%; restoring forests, peatlands and coastal mangroves to generate enough carbon dioxide saving to cancel out China\u2019s annual emissions; planting trees to save as much carbon dioxide as that emitted by the EU. Improving farming practices, including moving to more organic practices, would mean better soil management that could cut carbon dioxide equal to India\u2019s annual emissions. Consumer food waste in rich countries and big developing countries could be cut by a third, while the losses from food production in poor regions such as sub-Saharan Africa and south-east Asia could be cut drastically through simple measures such as more refrigeration and better transport. Moving a fifth of people to plant-based diets in developed and emerging countries, particularly the US, the EU, China, Brazil, Argentina and Russia, is seen as possible by 2030. These near-vegan diets would involve consuming less than 2,500 calories a day and no more than 60g of animal protein.

      "bodyText": "The architect behind the Philharmonie de Paris, one of the world\u2019s most expensive concert halls, is suing the body that manages it over fines issued against him when the building opened over-budget and behind schedule. The cost of the concert hall rose from \u20ac173m when the project was announced in 2006 to \u20ac386m by the time it opened two years late on 14 January 2015. In 2017, the Philharmonie issued the architect, Jean Nouvel, with a bill for \u20ac170.6m, which included vast penalties for late delivery. Now Nouvel\u2019s studio is counter-suing, saying the Philharmonie\u2019s claim is \u201ctotally disproportionate\u201d. Nouvel\u2019s lawyers, William Bourdon and Vincent Brengarth, said the claim against their client was all the more unusual for the fact that the concert hall was targeting only the architect and no other business involved in the project. They said the sums being demanded were \u201cunprecedented in the world of architecture\u201d and amounted to a death sentence for Nouvel\u2019s studio. The audacious Philharmonie building project was championed by the then president, Nicolas Sarkozy, who claimed: \u201cWho can argue that in this time of crisis we don\u2019t need music?\u201d But it rapidly became a symbol of massive public spending on vast building projects. As the architect and the building management prepare for a legal showdown, each side has blamed the other for mismanagement of the scheme. Nouvel initially described the Philharmonie as the most prestigious project of his career, but he later distanced himself from it and refused to attend the opening, saying it was not ready.",

The figure is expressed as a proportion of men\u2019s earnings. According to the ONS, the gap between what UK male and female workers earn \u2013 based on median hourly earnings for all workers&nbsp;\u2013 was 17.9% in April 2018, down from 18.4% in April 2017.

The second year of gender pay gap reports&nbsp; - and the first indicator of how public bodies and companies are performing - must be filed by April 2019</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What\u2019s the difference between the mean and the median figures?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Commonly known as the average, the <b>mean</b> is calculated by adding up the wages of all employees and dividing that figure by the number of employees. The mean gender pay gap is the difference between mean male pay and mean female pay.</p>\n    <p>The <b>median</b> gap is the difference between the employee in the middle of the range of male wages and the employee in the middle of the range of female wages. Typically <b>the median is the more representative figure</b>, because the mean can be skewed by a handful of highly paid employees.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What will happen if companies don\u2019t report?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/equality-and-human-rights-commission-ehrc\">Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC)</a>&nbsp;said that, while it would approach employers informally at first if they failed to publish figures by the deadline, businesses could ultimately face \u201cunlimited fines and convictions\u201d.

An injunction which prevented people from scaling the building had been put in place in 2018, in order to stop a protest about the number of empty luxury apartments in the Shard from going ahead. King, who admitted he had been aware of the injunction ahead of the climb, had expressed concern before the court hearing because the lack of other people being prosecuted for breaching it meant there was no precedent set for the harshness of any potential punishment. Although he was met by Metropolitan police officers after reaching the Shard\u2019s 310-metre (1,017ft) summit in 45 minutes, criminal charges against King for public nuisance and trespass were quickly dropped. The unaided climb was the first the then 19-year-old had attempted on a high-rise building. On Sunday, he said life had been \u201cpretty crazy\u201d since news of his feat spread. He had quit his job as a personal trainer at a gym after gaining a book deal, was filming a documentary and in talks about hosting his own TV series. A spokesperson from Real Estate Management Limited, which manages the Shard, said: \u201cMr George King-Thompson has today been found to be in contempt of court for breaching the terms of an injunction set by the high court in 2018 when he climbed the Shard earlier this year. \u201cWe felt we had no option than to secure the injunction and ask the court to uphold it. We hope that today\u2019s outcome will deter other prospective climbers, and help them recognise the great dangers that these actions pose to the public, emergency services and themselves.\u201d The Crown Prosecution Service has previously refused to comment on the legal status of climbing high-rise structures such as cranes and skyscrapers, but there are other ways to prosecute people for taking such risks. The Shard secured a high court injunction against Alain Robert, the urban climber nicknamed the French Spiderman, to stop him from climbing the building in 2018.",

Their success, this myth tells us, is a testament to their ability to divine what\u2019s best for society and bring it into existence; their fortunes are commensurate to their genius. Philanthropy, as such, isn\u2019t just an alternative to taxing them more but far preferable. After all, what could some collection of nameless, faceless bureaucrats know better than a man \u2013&#xa0;and they\u2019re usually men \u2013&#xa0;who has built such vast wealth? Vital innovation, Zuckerberg threatens, will only happen if you\u2019re nice enough to him and his rich friends.</p> <p>As common as this argument is, it also happens not to be true. Take the basis of Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s fortune. The internet was developed out of a small Pentagon network intended to allow the military to exchange information during the Cold War. In her book <em>The Entrepreneurial State, </em>economist Mariana Mazzucato shows that iPhones \u2013&#xa0;the ones that Facebook skims prolific amounts of data off of to sell to the highest bidder \u2013&#xa0;are in large part a collection of technologies created by various state agencies, cobbled together by Apple into the same sleek case. </p> <p>Instead of leading the way to improve health outcomes, the quest for profits in medicine has led drug companies to produce products just different enough from those of their competitors to patent, effectively allowing these firms collect rent from the sick. And of the top 88 innovations rated by <em>R&amp;D Magazine</em> as the most important between 1971 and 2006, economists Fred Block and Matthew Keller have <a href=\"https://itif.org/publications/2008/07/09/where-do-innovations-come-transformations-us-national-innovation-system-1970\">found</a> that 77 were the beneficiaries of substantial federal research funding, particularly in early stage development. \u201cIf one is looking for a golden age in which the private sector did most of the innovating on its own without federal help,\u201d they write, \u201cone has to go back to the era before World War II.\u201d Along the same timeline that the right has dragged the reputation of the public sector, it has only become more central to progress the private sector has taken credit for.</p> <p>Let\u2019s also not forget about the myriad boondoggles pumped out of Silicon Valley in the last decade, from Theranos to the Fyre Festival to Juicero. The recent implosion of the real estate company WeWork \u2013&#xa0;backed heartily by SoftBank and JP Morgan Chase, and losing one dollar for every dollar it makes \u2013&#xa0;should cast some doubt on the supposed genius of the private sector to overcome society\u2019s most pressing challenges, or even to pick winners. Besides government funding, too, most wunderkind tech companies are propped up by armies of typically underpaid workers, whether they\u2019re driving Ubers, mining the rare earth minerals needed for smartphones under brutal working conditions or watching hour after hour of grisly videos to moderate them out of our Facebook timelines.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t all to say that the private sector hasn\u2019t played a significant role in driving innovation; someone needed to design the iPhone, after all. But the the fortunes built off of each couldn\u2019t exist were it not for the government more often than not taking the first step, funding innovation far riskier than venture capitalists and angel investors can usually stomach. \u201cNot only has government funded the riskiest research,\u201d Mazzucato writes, \u201cbut it has indeed often been the source of the most radical, path-breaking types of innovation.\u201d The Mark Zuckerbergs of the world, in other words, can make good things happen. But they hardly ever do it alone.</p> <p>Moreover, billionaires\u2019 extravagant wealth is by and large not spent, as Zuckerberg suggests, on cutting edge research and philanthropic efforts. After they\u2019ve bought up enough yachts and private jets they mainly invest in making themselves richer through casino-style financial speculation and in luxury real estate in starkly unequal cities like San Francisco, Miami and New York, where mostly vacant homes act as safety deposit boxes to shield wealth from taxation. Their money might also end up in tax havens like the Cayman Islands, where it can sit undisturbed by the long arm of the state. Very little of that ever trickles down to the 99%, where inequality has skyrocketed and wages have stagnated.</p> <p>Zuckerberg\u2019s plea for the billionaire class is above all else deeply anti-democratic, casting doubt on the huddled masses\u2019 ability to decide what\u2019s best for themselves while repeating myths that the public sector is doomed to be wasteful and stagnant. While they could play some role in funding the genuinely cutting edge research coming out of places like ARPA-E and the National Institutes of Health, perhaps the best argument for the kinds of policies Sanders has proposed would be to make it clear that billionaires can\u2019t transcend democracy and call all the shots about what society needs and what it doesn\u2019t. In a truly democratic world \u2013&#xa0;where labor is valued fairly \u2013&#xa0;they wouldn\u2019t exist at all.</p> <ul> <li><p>Kate Aronoff is a freelance journalist based in New York City</p></li> </ul>",

Take the basis of Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s fortune. The internet was developed out of a small Pentagon network intended to allow the military to exchange information during the Cold War. In her book The Entrepreneurial State, economist Mariana Mazzucato shows that iPhones \u2013 the ones that Facebook skims prolific amounts of data off of to sell to the highest bidder \u2013 are in large part a collection of technologies created by various state agencies, cobbled together by Apple into the same sleek case. Instead of leading the way to improve health outcomes, the quest for profits in medicine has led drug companies to produce products just different enough from those of their competitors to patent, effectively allowing these firms collect rent from the sick. And of the top 88 innovations rated by R&amp;D Magazine as the most important between 1971 and 2006, economists Fred Block and Matthew Keller have found that 77 were the beneficiaries of substantial federal research funding, particularly in early stage development. \u201cIf one is looking for a golden age in which the private sector did most of the innovating on its own without federal help,\u201d they write, \u201cone has to go back to the era before World War II.\u201d Along the same timeline that the right has dragged the reputation of the public sector, it has only become more central to progress the private sector has taken credit for. Let\u2019s also not forget about the myriad boondoggles pumped out of Silicon Valley in the last decade, from Theranos to the Fyre Festival to Juicero. The recent implosion of the real estate company WeWork \u2013 backed heartily by SoftBank and JP Morgan Chase, and losing one dollar for every dollar it makes \u2013 should cast some doubt on the supposed genius of the private sector to overcome society\u2019s most pressing challenges, or even to pick winners. Besides government funding, too, most wunderkind tech companies are propped up by armies of typically underpaid workers, whether they\u2019re driving Ubers, mining the rare earth minerals needed for smartphones under brutal working conditions or watching hour after hour of grisly videos to moderate them out of our Facebook timelines. This isn\u2019t all to say that the private sector hasn\u2019t played a significant role in driving innovation; someone needed to design the iPhone, after all. But the the fortunes built off of each couldn\u2019t exist were it not for the government more often than not taking the first step, funding innovation far riskier than venture capitalists and angel investors can usually stomach. \u201cNot only has government funded the riskiest research,\u201d Mazzucato writes, \u201cbut it has indeed often been the source of the most radical, path-breaking types of innovation.\u201d The Mark Zuckerbergs of the world, in other words, can make good things happen. But they hardly ever do it alone. Moreover, billionaires\u2019 extravagant wealth is by and large not spent, as Zuckerberg suggests, on cutting edge research and philanthropic efforts. After they\u2019ve bought up enough yachts and private jets they mainly invest in making themselves richer through casino-style financial speculation and in luxury real estate in starkly unequal cities like San Francisco, Miami and New York, where mostly vacant homes act as safety deposit boxes to shield wealth from taxation. Their money might also end up in tax havens like the Cayman Islands, where it can sit undisturbed by the long arm of the state. Very little of that ever trickles down to the 99%, where inequality has skyrocketed and wages have stagnated. Zuckerberg\u2019s plea for the billionaire class is above all else deeply anti-democratic, casting doubt on the huddled masses\u2019 ability to decide what\u2019s best for themselves while repeating myths that the public sector is doomed to be wasteful and stagnant. While they could play some role in funding the genuinely cutting edge research coming out of places like ARPA-E and the National Institutes of Health, perhaps the best argument for the kinds of policies Sanders has proposed would be to make it clear that billionaires can\u2019t transcend democracy and call all the shots about what society needs and what it doesn\u2019t. In a truly democratic world \u2013 where labor is valued fairly \u2013 they wouldn\u2019t exist at all. Kate Aronoff is a freelance journalist based in New York City",

The dark pits of his eyes and the emaciated sheen of his decaying cheeks are captured in a few pen strokes. Leonardo even lists the exotic Turkish garments Baroncelli was hanged in after being brought back from Constantinople to face Lorenzo de\u2019 Medici\u2019s revenge.</p> <p>Leonardo is a movie camera, too. <a href=\"https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=717278&amp;partId=1\">Drawings of babies playing with cats </a>made in Florence around 1480 show motion as a blur of positions sketched as life happens \u2013 a multiple image unique to Leonardo. It also appears in his drawings of Saint Sebastian and a fight between a knight and dragon. These early sketches show him trying to draw as fast as life and somehow put the full complex flow of reality on paper. This becomes a delirious overload in his designs for The Adoration of the Magi, a painting he was never to finish. Here he tries to use vanishing-point perspective to contain an infinite vision of battles, buildings and nature receding into ambiguous chaos. It\u2019s dazzling. This boy from the Tuscan countryside had a brain that couldn\u2019t stop. He would spend the rest of his life applying it in a singlehanded attempt to understand nature and invent the technological age.</p> <p>Leonardo\u2019s attempts to reconcile science and art made him take on many projects and finish few.

On the opposite wall hangs The Virgin and Child With Saint Anne, Leonardo\u2019s last and greatest surviving painting. To add to this sublime gathering, the National Gallery has lent its full-size drawing of the Virgin and Saint Anne with Christ and Saint John the Baptist \u2013 known as <a href=\"https://www.leonardodavinci.net/the-burlington-house-cartoon.jsp\">The Burlington House Cartoon</a>. These marvels push at the boundaries of the known. The Virgin and Saint Anne achieves what Leonardo tried to do when he was young: contain the world in a painting. In the foreground, rocks and strata reveal his interest in geology. In the distance, blue Alps melt into a crystal atmosphere. It\u2019s like a model planet Earth. At the centre of it all are women and children \u2013 a mother, her son, his grandmother. Why are there two maternal presences? Freud observed that Leonardo had two mothers \u2013 his birth mother Caterina, a country girl his father never married, and his stepmother Albiera di Giovanni Amadori. Is Leonardo remembering his childhood in his last and most satisfying painting? In The Burlington House Cartoon, we see those two mothers but the older woman has a face as deathly as a hanged man\u2019s. It is a vision of hope and despair.</p> <p>But the Louvre can\u2019t completely ignore Lisa. You can put on a virtual reality headset to meet the \u201creal\u201d Lisa del Giocondo, the Florentine silk merchant\u2019s wife who posed for Leonardo in 1503. It\u2019s freaky to encounter in full VR an actor whose face has been digitally altered to give her the Mona Lisa\u2019s long fine nose and deep-set eyes.</p> <p>What a gimmick \u2013 and how Leonardo da Vinci would have loved it. He\u2019d probably prefer this techno Mona Lisa to his own painting. One thread that connects his experiments is the belief that the mathematics of perspective can mirror and make worlds. Virtual reality\u2019s illusion of solidity is a Renaissance dream come true. It\u2019s impossible to exhaust Leonardo\u2019s science-fiction prophecies, and this exhibition joyously opens his notebooks to us all.</p> <ul> <li><p>Leonardo da Vinci is at <a href=\"https://www.louvre.fr/en/expositions/leonardo-da-vinci\">the Louvre, Paris</a>, from 24 October to 24 February.</p></li> </ul>",

On the opposite wall hangs The Virgin and Child With Saint Anne, Leonardo\u2019s last and greatest surviving painting. To add to this sublime gathering, the National Gallery has lent its full-size drawing of the Virgin and Saint Anne with Christ and Saint John the Baptist \u2013 known as The Burlington House Cartoon. These marvels push at the boundaries of the known. The Virgin and Saint Anne achieves what Leonardo tried to do when he was young: contain the world in a painting. In the foreground, rocks and strata reveal his interest in geology. In the distance, blue Alps melt into a crystal atmosphere. It\u2019s like a model planet Earth. At the centre of it all are women and children \u2013 a mother, her son, his grandmother. Why are there two maternal presences? Freud observed that Leonardo had two mothers \u2013 his birth mother Caterina, a country girl his father never married, and his stepmother Albiera di Giovanni Amadori. Is Leonardo remembering his childhood in his last and most satisfying painting? In The Burlington House Cartoon, we see those two mothers but the older woman has a face as deathly as a hanged man\u2019s. It is a vision of hope and despair. But the Louvre can\u2019t completely ignore Lisa. You can put on a virtual reality headset to meet the \u201creal\u201d Lisa del Giocondo, the Florentine silk merchant\u2019s wife who posed for Leonardo in 1503. It\u2019s freaky to encounter in full VR an actor whose face has been digitally altered to give her the Mona Lisa\u2019s long fine nose and deep-set eyes. What a gimmick \u2013 and how Leonardo da Vinci would have loved it. He\u2019d probably prefer this techno Mona Lisa to his own painting. One thread that connects his experiments is the belief that the mathematics of perspective can mirror and make worlds. Virtual reality\u2019s illusion of solidity is a Renaissance dream come true. It\u2019s impossible to exhaust Leonardo\u2019s science-fiction prophecies, and this exhibition joyously opens his notebooks to us all. Leonardo da Vinci is at the Louvre, Paris, from 24 October to 24 February.",

      "bodyText": "A former Metropolitan police detective who successfully sued the force for wrongly using its powers to investigate her has lost her eight-year court battle to hold the police to account. Andrea Brown said after a new ruling against her she might become homeless paying the police\u2019s costs. \u201cIt can\u2019t be right that the police have been found to have acted unlawfully but I\u2019m the one being punished,\u201d she said. Brown, 53, had 20 years\u2019 service in the Met and was considered by her bosses to be an example of the force\u2019s commitment to diversity. For many years a portrait of her policing a football match hung in the foyer of Scotland Yard. Her problems began in 2011. Her father died while she was on sick leave and she travelled to Barbados to visit relatives with her mother and 14-year-old daughter. She informed her Police Federation representative that she was making the journey but not her immediate boss at Sutton police station. This was a minor disciplinary offence. However, instead of treating it as such, her boss approached the National Border Targeting Centre, which Greater Manchester police (GMP) help to run, to get personal information about Brown. The centre collects private information on people\u2019s whereabouts. An application to trace her movements with Virgin Atlantic was made citing a made-up act of parliament, Central London county court was told. When Brown discovered what her bosses had done she successfully sued the Met and GMP. She succeeded on claims for breach of data protection and human rights and misuse of private information but lost on a claim for misfeasance in public office and on a personal injury claim. The two police forces offered to settle the case out of court for a total of \u00a318,000. Brown rejected the offer, saying she was fighting the case on a point of principle. She said she wanted to ensure that other officers did not go through what she had gone through, and she wanted officers found by the court to have acted unlawfully to be disciplined. The court ruled she should be awarded \u00a39,000 in damages. Because this award was lower than the offer made by the police, she became liable to pay police costs from the point in time the offer had been made. The costs rules were found not to protect her from that liability because her case included non-personal injury claims. She has had to sell two successive homes to pay legal fees to continue fighting the case. This month the case reached the court of appeal.

Now, Kickstarter has a chance to do the right thing and unionize. Doing so would not only be ethical, but it would set an important precedent that could help rebuild the devastated American labor movement.</p> <p>If you had told me a few weeks ago that I would soon be entangled in a campaign against Kickstarter along with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Gaiman\">Neil Gaiman</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anita_Sarkeesian\">Anita Sarkeesian</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_Crabapple\">Molly Crabapple</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Herring\">Richard Herring</a>, it would have sounded like something out of a strange dream. Early last month, the magazine I run, Current Affairs, began a fundraising campaign on Kickstarter, which has long had a reputation as a powerful crowdfunding platform and an important tool for artists, inventors, game developers, and all kinds of independent creative types. Our magazine had <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/804992239/current-affairs-a-colorful-political-magazine?ref=user_menu\">started</a> through Kickstarter back in 2015, and so this year we decided to use it again when we needed some more funding for new projects.</p> <p>Then, in the middle of our fundraising campaign, the news broke that Kickstarter had <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/12/20863149/kickstarter-union-organizer-fired-retaliation-opeiu\">fired two union organizers</a> in eight days. The company claimed the firings were performance-related, but nearly half-a-dozen inside sources <a href=\"https://slate.com/technology/2019/09/kickstarter-union-organizing.html\">cast doubt</a> on this. It turned out that labor unrest had been <a href=\"https://slate.com/technology/2019/09/kickstarter-turmoil-union-drive-historic-tech-industry.html\">brewing</a> in Kickstarter for a year, with the company aggressively opposing union organizing efforts.</p> <p>As a left-wing magazine strongly supportive of the labor movement, we were unsure what to do. We didn\u2019t want to partner with a union-busting company, and we immediately started receiving questions and criticism from supporters. Kickstarter takes a percentage of all money raised, so a portion of supporters\u2019 dollars might end up going to lawyers and PR professionals fighting against the Kickstarter union.</p> <p>Current Affairs joined together with two other Kickstarter-funded magazines, Pinko and Protean, and put out a <a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/2019/09/we-stand-with-the-kickstarter-union\">statement</a> condemning the company for its anti-union tactics. Then we got a surprise: dozens upon dozens of other creators wanted to join us.

Many are the type of young progressives who know what it\u2019s like to struggle in a rigged economy, and they\u2019re naturally sympathetic to workers\u2019 demands for a union.</p> <p>Before now, Kickstarter had fought against unionization and fired organizers, but the union hadn\u2019t actually requested recognition.

Samira Ahmed\u2019s equal pay case against the BBC is expected to be the first of a number of claims from female staff members to make it to court, in what could be an embarrassing hearing for the corporation featuring a well-known journalist detailing claims against BBC management. Court listings seen by the Guardian show that Ahmed\u2019s case is due to be heard over three days from next Monday at an employment tribunal in central London, over an alleged \u201cfailure to provide equal pay for equal value work\u201d under the Equal Pay Act. Ahmed, who presents Newswatch on BBC One and BBC News and Radio 4\u2019s Front Row, referred a request for comment to her lawyers, who declined to add further detail. The BBC declined to comment on the case. Ahmed, a former Channel 4 News presenter, started her career at the BBC in the 1990s and has been a regular on the broadcaster in recent years. Newswatch holds the corporation to account for its editorial decisions, while her work on Front Row has made her a regular part of Radio 4\u2019s arts coverage. The BBC has faced a growing number of equal pay cases since the corporation was forced to start publishing the salaries of high-earning on-air presenters and reporters in 2017. This revealed the wide disparities between the salaries of many prominent journalists at the corporation, leaving the BBC to convince male presenters to take pay cuts while also trying to bump up the salaries of lesser-paid women at a time when the corporation is facing budget cuts. Many women at the BBC have felt this and other measures designed to benefit all staff have not done enough to right historical wrongs that meant women were underpaid for many years. Until now, most have chosen to settle cases before they reach court. The former BBC China editor Carrie Gracie quit after finding out she was paid less than equivalent male presenters, ultimately winning an apology and a payout from the corporation. Last month, the Guardian revealed that the former BBC employee Caroline Barlow had been given a \u00a3130,000 settlement by the broadcaster after she discovered 15 men in equivalent roles in her division were paid more than her. The former head of product in the corporation\u2019s design and engineering division claimed the BBC was such a discriminatory and hostile workplace environment that her position had become untenable, leaving her little choice but to resign. The BBC denied Barlow\u2019s allegations but in May it agreed to an out-of-court settlement on condition that she formally withdrew her claim. Her settlement included a \u201ctermination fee\u201d as compensation for her loss of employment.

That\u2019s geography. It\u2019s hard to think of any problem or opportunity that exists, that doesn\u2019t contain an inherent value or have a geospatial value. Geography is social, a form of visual communication, and maps are incredible sources of storytelling.</p> <p>If you want to unlock the endless possibilities of geography and the mystery of map-making, all you need is your curiosity and creativity (and a laptop, if you like) - and to come to this class. With <strong>Paul Naylor</strong> and <strong>Charley Glynn</strong>, visual data design consultants for Ordnance Survey, you will be taken through the theories behind the art of cartography, as well as how maps can be the foundation of any narrative - helping you to convey your message quickly, clearly and with great impact.</p> <p>Regardless of your level or ability, you will learn how geo data can be used as a key ingredient for a very diverse range of applications, from building maps for your website to learning how to craft compelling infographics. You will also learn the theory and practice behind the art of visualising with geo data, ultimately coming away with a strong understanding of the principles of cartographic design, and the toolkits used to design a web or mobile map.</p> <h2><strong>Course content</strong></h2> <ul> <li><p>Introduction to OS\u2019s history as Britain\u2019s national mapping agency</p></li> <li><p>GeoDataViz at OS - learn about some of OS\u2019s geo data visualisation projects</p></li> <li><p>The principals of cartography</p></li> <li><p>Maps: the good, the bad and the ugly - a group exercise</p></li> <li><p>Fake maps: how maps have been used to twist the truth</p></li> <li><p>Storytelling and map techniques for different scenarios - alternative approaches to visualising geographic data</p></li> <li><p>Design your own map - a group exercise</p></li> <li><p>Hands-on workshop using OS Open Zoomstack</p></li> </ul> <h2>Tutor profiles</h2> <p><strong>Charley Glynn</strong> is a cartographic design consultant for GeoDataViz, Ordnance Survey.

      "bodyText": "Book now Everything happens somewhere. That\u2019s geography. It\u2019s hard to think of any problem or opportunity that exists, that doesn\u2019t contain an inherent value or have a geospatial value. Geography is social, a form of visual communication, and maps are incredible sources of storytelling. If you want to unlock the endless possibilities of geography and the mystery of map-making, all you need is your curiosity and creativity (and a laptop, if you like) - and to come to this class. With Paul Naylor and Charley Glynn, visual data design consultants for Ordnance Survey, you will be taken through the theories behind the art of cartography, as well as how maps can be the foundation of any narrative - helping you to convey your message quickly, clearly and with great impact. Regardless of your level or ability, you will learn how geo data can be used as a key ingredient for a very diverse range of applications, from building maps for your website to learning how to craft compelling infographics. You will also learn the theory and practice behind the art of visualising with geo data, ultimately coming away with a strong understanding of the principles of cartographic design, and the toolkits used to design a web or mobile map. Course content Introduction to OS\u2019s history as Britain\u2019s national mapping agency GeoDataViz at OS - learn about some of OS\u2019s geo data visualisation projects The principals of cartography Maps: the good, the bad and the ugly - a group exercise Fake maps: how maps have been used to twist the truth Storytelling and map techniques for different scenarios - alternative approaches to visualising geographic data Design your own map - a group exercise Hands-on workshop using OS Open Zoomstack Tutor profiles Charley Glynn is a cartographic design consultant for GeoDataViz, Ordnance Survey.

      "bodyText": "Scottish judges have delayed a final ruling on whether Boris Johnson is in contempt of court to ensure he agrees to an extension to Brexit. Lord Carloway, the country\u2019s most senior judge, said they needed to be sure the prime minister did not try to block or sabotage the application he was forced to make on Saturday night for an extension to Brexit until 31 January. The court\u2019s decision, issued after a short hearing at the court of session in Edinburgh, means Johnson faces being held in contempt if judges rule he has failed to honour pledges made to court not to frustrate the extension process. Johnson sent an unsigned letter seeking the extension after the Commons voted narrowly in favour of postponing a vote on the government\u2019s revised deal to leave the UK. The legislation, the European Union (Withdrawal) (No 2) Act, known as the Benn act, also requires the prime minister to accept an extension if it is offered by Brussels and the 27 other EU member states. Elaine Motion, the solicitor for three anti-Brexit campaigners who took the case to court, said they feared he could try to thwart the process, perhaps by secretly asking an EU member state to veto the extension. If that occurs, they would immediately ask for the court to reconvene and consider contempt proceedings. The three campaigners, Dale Vince, the owner of the energy company Ecotricity, Jolyon Maugham QC and the SNP MP Joanna Cherry QC, launched a legal action last month asking the court to enforce the Benn act provisions requiring Johnson to seek an extension if he failed to get a Brexit deal passed by 19 October. They have sought interdicts, or injunctions, forcing Johnson to honour the Benn act and also asked the court to use its unique nobile officium powers to write that letter on the prime minister\u2019s behalf if he failed to do so. But Johnson could also fulfill the terms of the Benn act and avoid any further hearings of the legal challenge if he succeeds in getting a Brexit deal accepted and passed in the Commons and agreed by the EU in time to leave on 31 October. Aidan O\u2019Neill QC, the lawyer for the campaigners, told the court on Monday they accepted Johnson had met the first test of the Benn act by sending the extension letter but he said it remained far from clear whether he would act on an extension offer. O\u2019Neill said there was an open question whether the prime minister was already in contempt of court by sending a second, signed, letter to Donald Tusk telling the EU he did not believe an extension should be granted. O\u2019Neill read a transcript of undertakings by Andrew Webster QC, one of the UK government\u2019s lawyers, to the court on 9 October where Webster agreed that sending a second letter that tried to undermine the extension request \u201cwould be inconsistent\u201d with Johnson\u2019s pledges in court to uphold the Benn act\u2019s provisions. \u201cAt the very least, those words seem to be a very close sailing to the wind,\u201d O\u2019Neill told the court.

      "body": "<p>Just deal with the first half. That may, and arguably should, have been Eintracht Frankfurt\u2019s plan going into Friday night. The last time they\u2019d played Leverkusen, they had begun with hope <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/06/frankfurt-dark-day-leaves-dream-season-in-danger-of-hitting-the-rocks-bundesliga\" title=\"\">and ended humiliated</a>. Eintracht\u2019s trip to BayArena was set between the two legs of their Europa League semi-final with Chelsea, the third-from-last Bundesliga game of the season and with the team having the chance of a Champions League place in their own hands.</p> \n<p>It was, ultimately, the moment in which it became abundantly clear that Eintracht\u2019s tank had pretty much run dry. After 36 minutes in Leverkusen they were 6-1 down, shell-shocked and bereft. That ended up as the final score as they zombie-marched through the remainder of the game \u2013 as an almost equally-stunned home side did as well to an extent \u2013 and even though they ended that Sunday afternoon still in fourth place, it felt as if a fat wedge of possibility had been left there. They still managed, improbably, to pull a heroic performance out from somewhere for the second leg with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, and it was agonisingly close to being enough to get them to the Baku final. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/09/chelsea-eintracht-frankfurt-europa-league-semi-final-match-report-penalty-shootout\" title=\"\">They fell to the Blues on penalties in the end</a>, and that used up the last few drips of fuel Adi H\u00fctter and his team had.</p> \n<p>Eintracht ended 2018-19 as they had begun it in the DFL-Supercup, being absolutely flamed by Bayern and their former boss Niko Kova\u010d. Only Mainz\u2019s late surge against Hoffenheim, scoring three times in the closing ten minutes, enabled the most fun team in the Europa League the privilege of a return to the competition, beginning in July\u2019s second qualifying round, after hanging on to seventh place. The club\u2019s fans are a special breed, grateful for the journey as much as they are the destination, so recriminations for missing out on the top four were strictly limited.</p> \n<p>When footballers and coaches say that they\u2019re never interested in revenge, though, they\u2019re fibbing. On Friday night, Eintracht\u2019s will to put that first half horror show of five months back behind them couldn\u2019t have been clearer. Eintracht tore into the game, which was only three-and-a-half minutes old when Danny da Costa\u2019s through pass revealed their intentions. Open them up like they opened us. The ball trimmed Leverkusen\u2019s rearguard in two and Gon\u00e7alo Paci\u00eancia cruised on to that perfect transmission, holding off the floundering Aleksandar Dragovi\u0107 before sweeping home.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"04922b13db697d180df4f73bbe6274501bf38e81\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04922b13db697d180df4f73bbe6274501bf38e81/0_291_3567_2140/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eintracht Frankfurt\u2019s Bas Dost celebrates scoring in the morale-boosting 3-0 win against Bayer Leverkusen last Friday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eintracht Frankfurt\u2019s Bas Dost celebrates scoring in the morale-boosting 3-0 win against Bayer Leverkusen last Friday.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Armando Babani/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It got better for Eintracht, with Paci\u00eancia scoring a second from the spot. \u201cThe first half was definitely our best of the season so far,\u201d H\u00fctter beamed after the game, and after his side had toughed out a more difficult second half before Bas Dost\u2019s wonderfully, typically scruffy third sealed the points. The script was a well-worn one for Frankfurt, with the front men making the magic happen but the detail of the difference is key. It\u2019s not just the result for the BayArena that has flipped in the last few months.</p> \n<p>The front three that made Eintracht such an essential watch last season are all gone \u2013 S\u00e9bastien Haller to West Ham, Luka Jovi\u0107 to Real Madrid and Ante Rebi\u0107 went late in the window to Milan, in a swap which brought Portugal\u2019s Andr\u00e9 Silva back in return. It\u2019s hard to think of a more different forward trio to Haller, Jovi\u0107 and Rebi\u0107 than Paci\u00eancia, Silva and Dost (not least due to the fact that H\u00fctter seems disinclined to play all three at the same time). Paci\u00eancia comes closest of the three to filling the void of what Haller\u2019s all-round game provided, but the comparison (not least in terms of quality) feels a bit stretched. Yet for now, the new trio are filling their boots in a similar way to their predecessors. They have 11 of Eintracht\u2019s 14 Bundesliga goals to date between them.</p> \n<p>Whether H\u00fctter sees them as a three is a different question. The click between Paci\u00eancia and Dost, incidentally, might not even have got to work on Leverkusen had the former\u2019s compatriot Silva not been a late pull out with a foot problem. The assumption, on the completion of the transfer window, would have been that Dost and Silva would start with supplementary help from Filip Kosti\u0107.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <strong>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.<br></strong>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The Kosti\u0107 part of the equation is right. His performance on the left against Leverkusen was of such verve and ferocity that Mitchell Weiser, charged with taking care of him by Peter Bosz, was hooked after half-an-hour. Yet as Dost has been gradually blooded into H\u00fctter\u2019s system since returning to the Bundesliga from Portugal, he and Silva have fitted around the man who was back-up last term. Paci\u00eancia has blossomed.</p> \n<p>A graduate of the Porto academy like his father Domingos, it feels like this is Paci\u00eancia\u2019s time. At 25, he is no longer one for the future, but one that needs to produce now. He always had big shoes to fill. Domingos, a key part of Sir Bobby Robson\u2019s conquering Porto sides of the mid-90s, scored 131 goals for the club and won seven league titles while doing it. \u201cAt home, they always want to talk to my father, not me,\u201d he noted with a smile recently. In Germany, where Domingos\u2019 legend is less noted, Paci\u00eancia junior seems to be off the leash. At Porto, he was always destined to be compared with what went before. It\u2019s significant that his best spell back home was in a productive half-season loan with the more modest Vit\u00f3ria Set\u00fabal.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bfcee4a590ea867230f5c634b111a2202f825a49\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bfcee4a590ea867230f5c634b111a2202f825a49/0_0_2598_1559/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eintrach Frankfurt manager Adolf H\u00fctter, right, with Gon\u00e7alo Paci\u00eancia during the Champions League meeting with Vitoria SC earlier this month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eintrach Frankfurt manager Adolf H\u00fctter, right, with Gon\u00e7alo Paci\u00eancia during the Champions League meeting with Vitoria SC earlier this month.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gualter Fatia/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Now, he\u2019s ready.

      "bodyText": "Just deal with the first half. That may, and arguably should, have been Eintracht Frankfurt\u2019s plan going into Friday night. The last time they\u2019d played Leverkusen, they had begun with hope and ended humiliated. Eintracht\u2019s trip to BayArena was set between the two legs of their Europa League semi-final with Chelsea, the third-from-last Bundesliga game of the season and with the team having the chance of a Champions League place in their own hands. It was, ultimately, the moment in which it became abundantly clear that Eintracht\u2019s tank had pretty much run dry. After 36 minutes in Leverkusen they were 6-1 down, shell-shocked and bereft. That ended up as the final score as they zombie-marched through the remainder of the game \u2013 as an almost equally-stunned home side did as well to an extent \u2013 and even though they ended that Sunday afternoon still in fourth place, it felt as if a fat wedge of possibility had been left there. They still managed, improbably, to pull a heroic performance out from somewhere for the second leg with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, and it was agonisingly close to being enough to get them to the Baku final. They fell to the Blues on penalties in the end, and that used up the last few drips of fuel Adi H\u00fctter and his team had. Eintracht ended 2018-19 as they had begun it in the DFL-Supercup, being absolutely flamed by Bayern and their former boss Niko Kova\u010d. Only Mainz\u2019s late surge against Hoffenheim, scoring three times in the closing ten minutes, enabled the most fun team in the Europa League the privilege of a return to the competition, beginning in July\u2019s second qualifying round, after hanging on to seventh place. The club\u2019s fans are a special breed, grateful for the journey as much as they are the destination, so recriminations for missing out on the top four were strictly limited. When footballers and coaches say that they\u2019re never interested in revenge, though, they\u2019re fibbing. On Friday night, Eintracht\u2019s will to put that first half horror show of five months back behind them couldn\u2019t have been clearer. Eintracht tore into the game, which was only three-and-a-half minutes old when Danny da Costa\u2019s through pass revealed their intentions. Open them up like they opened us. The ball trimmed Leverkusen\u2019s rearguard in two and Gon\u00e7alo Paci\u00eancia cruised on to that perfect transmission, holding off the floundering Aleksandar Dragovi\u0107 before sweeping home. It got better for Eintracht, with Paci\u00eancia scoring a second from the spot. \u201cThe first half was definitely our best of the season so far,\u201d H\u00fctter beamed after the game, and after his side had toughed out a more difficult second half before Bas Dost\u2019s wonderfully, typically scruffy third sealed the points. The script was a well-worn one for Frankfurt, with the front men making the magic happen but the detail of the difference is key. It\u2019s not just the result for the BayArena that has flipped in the last few months. The front three that made Eintracht such an essential watch last season are all gone \u2013 S\u00e9bastien Haller to West Ham, Luka Jovi\u0107 to Real Madrid and Ante Rebi\u0107 went late in the window to Milan, in a swap which brought Portugal\u2019s Andr\u00e9 Silva back in return. It\u2019s hard to think of a more different forward trio to Haller, Jovi\u0107 and Rebi\u0107 than Paci\u00eancia, Silva and Dost (not least due to the fact that H\u00fctter seems disinclined to play all three at the same time). Paci\u00eancia comes closest of the three to filling the void of what Haller\u2019s all-round game provided, but the comparison (not least in terms of quality) feels a bit stretched. Yet for now, the new trio are filling their boots in a similar way to their predecessors. They have 11 of Eintracht\u2019s 14 Bundesliga goals to date between them. Whether H\u00fctter sees them as a three is a different question. The click between Paci\u00eancia and Dost, incidentally, might not even have got to work on Leverkusen had the former\u2019s compatriot Silva not been a late pull out with a foot problem. The assumption, on the completion of the transfer window, would have been that Dost and Silva would start with supplementary help from Filip Kosti\u0107. The Kosti\u0107 part of the equation is right. His performance on the left against Leverkusen was of such verve and ferocity that Mitchell Weiser, charged with taking care of him by Peter Bosz, was hooked after half-an-hour. Yet as Dost has been gradually blooded into H\u00fctter\u2019s system since returning to the Bundesliga from Portugal, he and Silva have fitted around the man who was back-up last term. Paci\u00eancia has blossomed. A graduate of the Porto academy like his father Domingos, it feels like this is Paci\u00eancia\u2019s time. At 25, he is no longer one for the future, but one that needs to produce now. He always had big shoes to fill. Domingos, a key part of Sir Bobby Robson\u2019s conquering Porto sides of the mid-90s, scored 131 goals for the club and won seven league titles while doing it. \u201cAt home, they always want to talk to my father, not me,\u201d he noted with a smile recently. In Germany, where Domingos\u2019 legend is less noted, Paci\u00eancia junior seems to be off the leash. At Porto, he was always destined to be compared with what went before. It\u2019s significant that his best spell back home was in a productive half-season loan with the more modest Vit\u00f3ria Set\u00fabal. Now, he\u2019s ready. Paci\u00eancia is becoming a tremendous focal point for H\u00fctter\u2019s team. That Dost had his best game for the club so far, with Paci\u00eancia doing his stuff, was surely no coincidence. On top of that, the Portuguese has already matched his best-ever goal tally for a league season \u2013 five, which underlines how peripatetic and sometimes frustrating his first-team career to date has been \u2013 with the promise of more to come. Eintracht fans might not have imagined their front three looking like this but for now, it looks pretty good. Talking points \u2022 Eintracht are in the mix with a clutch of other teams, with only two points separating the top nine. Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach remain top despite losing at Dortmund. Marco Reus, inevitably, scored the winner against his own club while Thorgan Hazard (who created the goal) had his best BVB game yet against his former club \u2013 which he needed to, with Jadon Sancho left out for returning late from international duty. \u2022 It was another strange afternoon for Bayern, who conceded in the first and last minute at Augsburg to let further points slip in a 2-2 draw. Manuel Neuer, one of the few to speak post-game in a tense atmosphere, might be more busy in the coming weeks after the devastating news that their best defender Niklas S\u00fcle ruptured his ACL in the game.",

It is understood that Nawana, who is based in Andover in Massachusetts, is leaving because his requests for higher pay, in line with the packages awarded by US medical device-makers, could not be met under UK corporate governance standards. The board reportedly discussed relocating the company to the US over the summer. Shares in the FTSE 100 firm \u2013 which began as a pharmacy in Hull more than 160 years ago \u2013 fell more than 8% to \u00a316.81 at lunchtime on Monday, wiping more than \u00a31bn off its market value. Diggelmann ran Roche Diagnostics, a subsidiary of the Swiss healthcare firm Roche with an annual turnover of CHF11.5bn (\u00a39bn), for six years until 2018 and previously worked at Sulzer Orthopedics and Zimmer. Analysts at Berenberg noted that Diggelmann was considered for the CEO role in October 2017 but was unable to join then from Roche Diagnostics. They did not expect any change in strategy and believed many shareholders, in particular specialist healthcare investors, were \u201clikely to look upon him favourably\u201d. They added: \u201cMany investors, particularly in the UK, will applaud the board\u2019s decision to stand firm on executive pay.\u201d Diggelmann, a Swiss national, will be based at Smith &amp; Nephew\u2019s site in Baar, Switzerland, which will move to Zug next year. He will be paid an annual salary of \u00a31.08m, as part of a pay package of up to \u00a35.5m including bonuses, dependent on performance. This includes a pension contribution of 12% of salary. His predecessor joined on a similar annual salary of \u00a31.1m but has been receiving bigger pension contributions, of 21.5% of salary, as well as cash and share bonuses. He could receive a maximum package of just over \u00a36m this year. Nawana joined Smith &amp; Nephew in May 2018 after turning around the US diagnostics firm Alere and overseeing its sale to Abbott for $5.3bn in 2017. He has resisted pressure from the British company\u2019s activist investor Elliott Advisors to break itself up. Roberto Quarta, Smith &amp; Nephew\u2019s chairman, said Nawana had \u201csubstantially transformed the business with a new strategy, purpose and culture, and renewed commitment to innovation, returning it to an improved growth trajectory\u201d. The company was founded in 1856 by Thomas James Smith, who was later joined by his nephew.",

Planning inspectors want Khan to withdraw his objections to Heathrow\u2019s expansion, permit fracking in London, and loosen his commitment to the green belt by allowing building in \u201cvery special circumstances\u201d. Khan is expected to write formally to the secretary of state for housing, communities and local government, Robert Jenrick, to reject these proposed changes to the \u201cLondon Plan\u201d policy. Ministers will then have six weeks to choose whether to force through the changes by legal means. The brewing row highlights the tensions between local governments, which in some areas are taking a tough stance on climate change and environmental issues such as air pollution, and central government, which is accused of lagging behind on concrete actions to fulfil the UK\u2019s national goals on the climate emergency and environmental protections.

A report by the Planning Inspectorate, a quasi-independent government agency, suggested changes to the London Plan that would allow for fracking in London, and for development in the green belt \u201cin very special circumstances\u201d, with alterations to the boundary of the green belt in \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d.

      "body": "<p>The journalist Deborah Orr, who has died aged 57 after suffering from cancer, was a strikingly original character, and made an impression in whatever she did. From 1993 to 1998 she proved to be a gifted editor of the Guardian\u2019s Weekend magazine, setting a serious tone and a high bar by eschewing trivia in favour of carefully chosen big reads, often on challenging subjects. </p> <p>However, she made her most public mark as a columnist, one of the small tribe of trenchant writers with the panache to walk the high wire of tackling social, political and personal issues in an engaging manner, week after week, in her case for the next two decades.</p> <p>The original suggestion came from Simon Kelner, the editor of the Independent. It followed a turbulent period when Orr had served as an unhappy literary editor of the Guardian and left the paper in the wake of the departure of her then husband, the journalist, author and media personality <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/will-self\" title=\"\">Will Self</a> from its sister paper, the Observer. He was sacked after admitting taking heroin in the toilet of John Major\u2019s plane during the 1997 general election campaign, her plea that he be allowed to resign notwithstanding.</p> <p>Orr had a loyal following as a columnist at <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/author/by-deborah-orr\" title=\"\">the Independent</a> (1999-2009), then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/deborah-orr\" title=\"\">back at the Guardian</a> until its reshaping as a tabloid in 2018, and finally at <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/author/deborah-orr\" title=\"\">the i newspaper</a>. Fans appreciated her muscular style and voice. As she led them through an argument to her conclusions, the workings of her mind were visible, and she was not polemical.</p> <p>She praised the benefits of inner-city life over the suburbs, despite her neighbour being stabbed to death. She was early on to the fact that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/20/police-give-up-low-level-crime-high-price-message-victims-criminals\" title=\"\">minor crime was not being checked by policing</a>, resulting in a permissive atmosphere and the increase in knife crime. Brexit was \u201clike deciding you are going to cure cancer by giving up membership of your golf club\u201d, she opined.</p> <p>She had an intensity that less assured people and even editors found intimidating: some were fearful of taking her calls. With long hair, a taste for thigh-high brown boots, leather miniskirts, Goth-style apparel or long swishy skirts, she had a Dorothy Parker manner, sardonically witty and somewhat haughty. But she certainly had a soft side, and never sought the media profile bestowed on her husband by television and radio. </p> <p>They married in 1997: Orr became stepmother to Self\u2019s children, Alexis and Madeleine, and they went on to have two sons. For a time the couple were glamorous fringe bohemians of the Groucho Club set and put on lavish parties. Orr held an annual Christmas \u201cno men allowed\u201d party for female friends at their house in Stockwell, south London. This building became a news story in itself after a large chunk of masonry fell from its facade to the ground.</p> <p>She created a beautiful garden, and developed a sympathetic ear to the troubles of others. When her divorce was finalised last year she bought a house in Brighton.</p> <p>In 2017, in a Guardian column, she revealed her diagnosis of complex post-traumatic stress disorder, rooted in a working-class childhood in her birthplace of Motherwell, near Glasgow, as the daughter of Win (Winifred, nee Avis) and her husband, John Orr, a factory worker.

      "bodyText": "The journalist Deborah Orr, who has died aged 57 after suffering from cancer, was a strikingly original character, and made an impression in whatever she did. From 1993 to 1998 she proved to be a gifted editor of the Guardian\u2019s Weekend magazine, setting a serious tone and a high bar by eschewing trivia in favour of carefully chosen big reads, often on challenging subjects. However, she made her most public mark as a columnist, one of the small tribe of trenchant writers with the panache to walk the high wire of tackling social, political and personal issues in an engaging manner, week after week, in her case for the next two decades. The original suggestion came from Simon Kelner, the editor of the Independent. It followed a turbulent period when Orr had served as an unhappy literary editor of the Guardian and left the paper in the wake of the departure of her then husband, the journalist, author and media personality Will Self from its sister paper, the Observer. He was sacked after admitting taking heroin in the toilet of John Major\u2019s plane during the 1997 general election campaign, her plea that he be allowed to resign notwithstanding. Orr had a loyal following as a columnist at the Independent (1999-2009), then back at the Guardian until its reshaping as a tabloid in 2018, and finally at the i newspaper. Fans appreciated her muscular style and voice. As she led them through an argument to her conclusions, the workings of her mind were visible, and she was not polemical. She praised the benefits of inner-city life over the suburbs, despite her neighbour being stabbed to death. She was early on to the fact that minor crime was not being checked by policing, resulting in a permissive atmosphere and the increase in knife crime. Brexit was \u201clike deciding you are going to cure cancer by giving up membership of your golf club\u201d, she opined. She had an intensity that less assured people and even editors found intimidating: some were fearful of taking her calls. With long hair, a taste for thigh-high brown boots, leather miniskirts, Goth-style apparel or long swishy skirts, she had a Dorothy Parker manner, sardonically witty and somewhat haughty. But she certainly had a soft side, and never sought the media profile bestowed on her husband by television and radio. They married in 1997: Orr became stepmother to Self\u2019s children, Alexis and Madeleine, and they went on to have two sons. For a time the couple were glamorous fringe bohemians of the Groucho Club set and put on lavish parties. Orr held an annual Christmas \u201cno men allowed\u201d party for female friends at their house in Stockwell, south London. This building became a news story in itself after a large chunk of masonry fell from its facade to the ground. She created a beautiful garden, and developed a sympathetic ear to the troubles of others. When her divorce was finalised last year she bought a house in Brighton. In 2017, in a Guardian column, she revealed her diagnosis of complex post-traumatic stress disorder, rooted in a working-class childhood in her birthplace of Motherwell, near Glasgow, as the daughter of Win (Winifred, nee Avis) and her husband, John Orr, a factory worker. The condition left her uncertain of dates, barely able to remember events of the past decade. Her bravado was a camouflage for insecurity. This self-discovery led to a memoir, Motherwell: A Girlhood, to be published in January: writing it took over from column writing. It charted the influence of her mother, who railed against Deborah going to university. Win\u2019s life had been determined by men. She wanted the same for her clever daughter, who duly went her own way after attending a local comprehensive school, Garrion academy, Wishaw, and collecting an MA (1983) from St Andrews University, where she had studied English.

      "body": "<p>If you exclusively watched Atalanta in the Champions League this season, you might have concluded this Cinderella story had reached midnight. Thrashed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/match/2019/sep/18/dinamozagreb-v-atalanta\" title=\"\">4-0 by Dinamo Zagreb</a>, and then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/match/2019/oct/01/atalanta-v-shakhtardonetsk\" title=\"\">beaten at home by Shakhtar Donetsk</a>, the debutants are rushing to exit the European ball they wished so desperately to attend.</p> \n<p>Their run could effectively be ended by Manchester City over the next two match days, starting at the Etihad Stadium on Tuesday night.</p> \n<p>There are no happily-ever-afters for football fairytales. Financial realities always come to bear eventually and Atalanta remain a team representing a town of little more than 100,000 people. Even after rewarding their best players with new contracts in the summer, their wage bill does not make it into Italy\u2019s top 10 (though it is far larger than Dinamo\u2019s \u2026).</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/20/serie-a-roundup-ronaldo-vieira-racially-abused-by-roma-fans\">Serie A roundup: Sampdoria\u2019s Ronaldo Vieira racially abused by Roma fans</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>For Atalanta to finish third in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/jun/05/its-the-bandinis-2019-the-complete-review-of-serie-a-2018-19-season\" title=\"\">Serie A last season</a> required richer clubs to underperform, while Duv\u00e1n Zapata, Josip Ilicic and Papu G\u00f3mez produced the best football of their careers. Neither scenario could endure indefinitely.</p> \n<p>And yet, the truth is neither has unravelled just yet. Notwithstanding their European struggles, Atalanta have begun their domestic campaign in magnificent form. Heading into the international break, they were third and top of the scoring charts \u2013 with 18 goals in seven games. Only three points separated them from the league leaders, Juventus.</p> \n<p>They returned on Saturday for a daunting match away against Lazio. Their previous trip to face these opponents at the Stadio Olimpico, for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/may/16/lazio-bring-atalanta-down-to-earth-with-coppa-italia-triumph\" title=\"\">Coppa Italia final in May</a>, ended in a 2-0 defeat. This time, Atalanta would be without Zapata, their top scorer, after he strained an adductor playing for Colombia.</p> \n<p>By the 37th minute, they were 3-0 ahead. If anything, their lead could have had been even bigger. Atalanta were spell-binding, shredding Lazio\u2019s defence with the speed and directness of their interchanges.</p> \n<p>Gian Piero Gasperini redesigned his attack in Zapata\u2019s absence, deploying Mario Pasalic and Ruslan Malinovskyi as twin supports to Luis Muriel up front \u2013 operating on the left and right respectively. G\u00f3mez was given licence to travel precisely wherever he wanted \u2013 thwarting Marco Parolo\u2019s intention to restrict him from the base of midfield.</p> \n<p>The first goal was a thing of beauty, Pasalic launching the attack when he returned Robin Gosens\u2019s pass with a first-time backheel. The latter player hurdled a defender and carved inside, running beyond Muriel and just far enough to persuade the defenders to turn with him before cutting a pass back to the Colombian for a simple finish.</p> \n<p>Muriel would score Atalanta\u2019s second, too \u2013 his fifth goal in six appearances since joining from Sevilla (via a loan at Fiorentina) in the summer, despite the fact it was only his second start. By the time G\u00f3mez ran on to Rafael Tol\u00f3i\u2019s through-pass for the third, the contest appeared to be over.</p> \n<p>It was anything but. Atalanta, for all their glorious attacking play, have been rather less brilliant at defending. They gifted Lazio a way back when Jos\u00e9 Palomino took a clumsy second nibble at Ciro Immobile inside the box, his heel landing just barely \u2013 but enough \u2013 on the striker\u2019s little toe.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"405fc32fc2aa95dfd5bc64ffb1deae7a4290099f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/405fc32fc2aa95dfd5bc64ffb1deae7a4290099f/106_69_2786_1672/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gian Piero Gasperini redesigned his attack for Atalanta\u2019s visit to Lazio in Serie A on Saturday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gian Piero Gasperini redesigned his attack for Atalanta\u2019s visit to Lazio in Serie A on Saturday.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Angelo Carconi/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Immobile converted in the 69th minute. Within seconds, it was 3-2, Remo Freuler\u2019s misstep allowing Joaqu\u00edn Correa to get behind him and bury a shot into the roof of the net.</p> \n<p>Even then, Atalanta should have won. In the 89th minute Ilicic, on as a substitute, fed G\u00f3mez with a cross from the right. The Lazio goalkeeper, Thomas Strakosha, was out sharply to deny him but it was remarkable that in among the subsequent pinball of passes and blocked shots nobody found a way to force the ball across the line.</p> \n<p>Instead, the visitors completed their collapse in injury time, gifting Lazio a second penalty. Immobile was fishing for it with a deliberate step across Marten de Roon as the defender lunged after the ball but the result was a clear penalty, despite Gasperini\u2019s protests.</p> \n<p>A 3-3 draw scarcely felt credible in light of the one-sided first half, when Atalanta had seven shots on goal to Lazio\u2019s none. The sense of giddy disbelief inside the Olimpico was best summed up by Immobile\u2019s celebration as he attempted and failed to rip off his shirt, pulling it up over his head and then falling over sideways.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/19/la-liga-eibar-barcelona-serie-a-bundesliga\">European roundup: Real Madrid and Bayern suffer shocks, Barcelona cruise</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>For Atalanta, it was hard to know whether this performance should be viewed as encouraging or alarming before the visit to City. They had shown again they are no flash in the pan, comfortably outplaying opponents with greater resources. But they have now kept just a single clean sheet in 10 matches across all competitions. Such generosity will be punished harshly at the Etihad Stadium.</p> \n<p>Either way, do not expect Atalanta to take a step back. In an interview with Sky Sports, G\u00f3mez said his team \u201cmust try to dictate the play [in Manchester] as we always do in the league\u201d. He is not naive to the likely consequences. \u201cLet\u2019s recognise that City are at much higher level than Atalanta,\u201d he said, \u201cand maybe than any other team in Europe.\u201d</p> \n<p>Perhaps Cinderella is not dashing for the exit after all. She knows she will be turfed out of the Champions League party sooner or later. What G\u00f3mez and his colleagues hope, at this stage, is that the world will at least get a glimpse of how well she can dance, before those diamond shoes come off.</p> \n<h2>Talking points</h2> \n<p>\u2022 Goals! Goals! Goals! Seven at Mapei Stadium, where Internazionale very nearly imitated Atalanta as they went from 4-1 up and cruising against Sassuolo to barely clinging on at 4-3. Six more at the Tardini, where Parma walloped Genoa. Thirty-one in total across the weekend\u2019s nine games and a few absolute gems in there as well, from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s10w3QC2Us8\" title=\"\">Radja Nainggolan\u2019s thunderous half-volley</a> to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvP5_xZIUrQ&amp;\" title=\"\">Hakan Calhanoglu finding the angle</a> for Milan and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZEclu-wnIs&amp;t=3m26s\" title=\"\">J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Boga weaving through</a> the Inter defence.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Nainggolan had tears in his eyes after the goal which he dedicated to his wife, Claudia, who has been undergoing chemotherapy after being diagnosed with breast cancer. His goal was a continuation of good things on the pitch since he returned to Cagliari, whose 14 points from eight games represent their best start in the era of three for a win.</p> \n<p>\u2022 No goals for Claudio Ranieri, though, as he celebrated his 68th birthday by guiding Sampdoria to a 0-0 draw with Roma in his first game in charge. A dreadful game, but a good result for the Blucerchiati.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Stefano Pioli\u2019s first game in charge at Milan also ended in a draw, albeit a far less satisfying one at home against Lecce. Milan were a goal and a man up heading into injury time, too. I would still argue this was a game to find positives in, from the performance of Calhanoglu \u2013 who also set up Milan\u2019s second \u2013 through to Krzysztof Piatek scoring his first goal in five games.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"70ff3606-d9d7-4e76-8c47-dbda0eea9495\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n

      "bodyText": "If you exclusively watched Atalanta in the Champions League this season, you might have concluded this Cinderella story had reached midnight. Thrashed 4-0 by Dinamo Zagreb, and then beaten at home by Shakhtar Donetsk, the debutants are rushing to exit the European ball they wished so desperately to attend. Their run could effectively be ended by Manchester City over the next two match days, starting at the Etihad Stadium on Tuesday night. There are no happily-ever-afters for football fairytales. Financial realities always come to bear eventually and Atalanta remain a team representing a town of little more than 100,000 people. Even after rewarding their best players with new contracts in the summer, their wage bill does not make it into Italy\u2019s top 10 (though it is far larger than Dinamo\u2019s \u2026). For Atalanta to finish third in Serie A last season required richer clubs to underperform, while Duv\u00e1n Zapata, Josip Ilicic and Papu G\u00f3mez produced the best football of their careers. Neither scenario could endure indefinitely. And yet, the truth is neither has unravelled just yet. Notwithstanding their European struggles, Atalanta have begun their domestic campaign in magnificent form. Heading into the international break, they were third and top of the scoring charts \u2013 with 18 goals in seven games. Only three points separated them from the league leaders, Juventus. They returned on Saturday for a daunting match away against Lazio. Their previous trip to face these opponents at the Stadio Olimpico, for the Coppa Italia final in May, ended in a 2-0 defeat. This time, Atalanta would be without Zapata, their top scorer, after he strained an adductor playing for Colombia. By the 37th minute, they were 3-0 ahead. If anything, their lead could have had been even bigger. Atalanta were spell-binding, shredding Lazio\u2019s defence with the speed and directness of their interchanges. Gian Piero Gasperini redesigned his attack in Zapata\u2019s absence, deploying Mario Pasalic and Ruslan Malinovskyi as twin supports to Luis Muriel up front \u2013 operating on the left and right respectively. G\u00f3mez was given licence to travel precisely wherever he wanted \u2013 thwarting Marco Parolo\u2019s intention to restrict him from the base of midfield. The first goal was a thing of beauty, Pasalic launching the attack when he returned Robin Gosens\u2019s pass with a first-time backheel. The latter player hurdled a defender and carved inside, running beyond Muriel and just far enough to persuade the defenders to turn with him before cutting a pass back to the Colombian for a simple finish. Muriel would score Atalanta\u2019s second, too \u2013 his fifth goal in six appearances since joining from Sevilla (via a loan at Fiorentina) in the summer, despite the fact it was only his second start. By the time G\u00f3mez ran on to Rafael Tol\u00f3i\u2019s through-pass for the third, the contest appeared to be over. It was anything but. Atalanta, for all their glorious attacking play, have been rather less brilliant at defending. They gifted Lazio a way back when Jos\u00e9 Palomino took a clumsy second nibble at Ciro Immobile inside the box, his heel landing just barely \u2013 but enough \u2013 on the striker\u2019s little toe. Immobile converted in the 69th minute. Within seconds, it was 3-2, Remo Freuler\u2019s misstep allowing Joaqu\u00edn Correa to get behind him and bury a shot into the roof of the net. Even then, Atalanta should have won. In the 89th minute Ilicic, on as a substitute, fed G\u00f3mez with a cross from the right. The Lazio goalkeeper, Thomas Strakosha, was out sharply to deny him but it was remarkable that in among the subsequent pinball of passes and blocked shots nobody found a way to force the ball across the line. Instead, the visitors completed their collapse in injury time, gifting Lazio a second penalty. Immobile was fishing for it with a deliberate step across Marten de Roon as the defender lunged after the ball but the result was a clear penalty, despite Gasperini\u2019s protests. A 3-3 draw scarcely felt credible in light of the one-sided first half, when Atalanta had seven shots on goal to Lazio\u2019s none. The sense of giddy disbelief inside the Olimpico was best summed up by Immobile\u2019s celebration as he attempted and failed to rip off his shirt, pulling it up over his head and then falling over sideways. For Atalanta, it was hard to know whether this performance should be viewed as encouraging or alarming before the visit to City. They had shown again they are no flash in the pan, comfortably outplaying opponents with greater resources. But they have now kept just a single clean sheet in 10 matches across all competitions. Such generosity will be punished harshly at the Etihad Stadium. Either way, do not expect Atalanta to take a step back. In an interview with Sky Sports, G\u00f3mez said his team \u201cmust try to dictate the play [in Manchester] as we always do in the league\u201d. He is not naive to the likely consequences. \u201cLet\u2019s recognise that City are at much higher level than Atalanta,\u201d he said, \u201cand maybe than any other team in Europe.\u201d Perhaps Cinderella is not dashing for the exit after all. She knows she will be turfed out of the Champions League party sooner or later. What G\u00f3mez and his colleagues hope, at this stage, is that the world will at least get a glimpse of how well she can dance, before those diamond shoes come off. Talking points \u2022 Goals! Goals! Goals! Seven at Mapei Stadium, where Internazionale very nearly imitated Atalanta as they went from 4-1 up and cruising against Sassuolo to barely clinging on at 4-3. Six more at the Tardini, where Parma walloped Genoa. Thirty-one in total across the weekend\u2019s nine games and a few absolute gems in there as well, from Radja Nainggolan\u2019s thunderous half-volley to Hakan Calhanoglu finding the angle for Milan and J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Boga weaving through the Inter defence. \u2022 Nainggolan had tears in his eyes after the goal which he dedicated to his wife, Claudia, who has been undergoing chemotherapy after being diagnosed with breast cancer. His goal was a continuation of good things on the pitch since he returned to Cagliari, whose 14 points from eight games represent their best start in the era of three for a win. \u2022 No goals for Claudio Ranieri, though, as he celebrated his 68th birthday by guiding Sampdoria to a 0-0 draw with Roma in his first game in charge. A dreadful game, but a good result for the Blucerchiati. \u2022 Stefano Pioli\u2019s first game in charge at Milan also ended in a draw, albeit a far less satisfying one at home against Lecce. Milan were a goal and a man up heading into injury time, too. I would still argue this was a game to find positives in, from the performance of Calhanoglu \u2013 who also set up Milan\u2019s second \u2013 through to Krzysztof Piatek scoring his first goal in five games.",

Petersen, writing in the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet, described Handke as an \u201canti-nationalistic\u201d advocate for peace, according to a translation by AFP. \u201cIn 50 years ... Peter Handke, just like Beckett, will be among the most obvious choices the Swedish Academy ever made, of that I am certain,\u201d he wrote. Peterson argued that Handke is \u201cradically unpolitical\u201d in his writing, and said his support for the Serbs had been misunderstood. The main thrust of his argument was that the Serbian point of view was missing in German and Austrian media. Also writing in Dagens Nyheter, K\u00e4rde said: \u201cWhen we give the award to Handke, we argue that the task of literature is other than to confirm and reproduce what society\u2019s central view believes is morally right.\u201d While she wrote that she didn\u2019t want to \u201capologise for the hair-raising things that Handke has undoubtedly said and done\u201d, she said that the Nobel committee concluded that he \u201cabsolutely deserves a Nobel prize\u201d. Handke himself has said that he will never talk to journalists again following a deluge of questions about his political views. \u201cI\u2019m standing at my garden gate and there are 50 journalists \u2013 and all of them just ask me questions like you do, and from not a single person who comes to me I hear they have read any of my works or know what I have written,\u201d he told the Austrian broadcaster ORF last week. \u201cIt\u2019s only questions like how does the world react. Reactions to reactions to reactions. I am a writer, I come from Tolstoy, from Homer, from Cervantes. Leave me in peace and don\u2019t ask me questions like that.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 23 October 2019. An earlier version referred to a 2006 comment Peter Handke reportedly gave in response to a question about atrocities in Serbia. This was a misquote and has been removed.",

      "bodyText": "In 2019, the ultra-popular teen comedy Glee largely exists in the public consciousness as the punchline to a joke. The subject of monthly Twitter threads lamenting its best worst moments, it is pretty easy to forget just how popular it once was. Bringing musical theatre to the small screen, Ryan Murphy\u2019s comedy follows the New Directions, an Ohio-based, high school show choir. Initially made up of a small group of students at the bottom of the food chain, the club is turned upside down when quarterback Finn Hudson (the late Cory Monteith) is blackmailed into joining by teacher Will Schuester (a perma-smiling Matthew Morrison) who plants weed in his locker. With Finn\u2019s fellow football players and cheerleaders following, Glee Club becomes temporarily cool. Best known for its campy musical numbers, the show\u2019s numerous spin-off soundtracks \u2013 featuring a mix of classic rock (along with the Sopranos, the show gave Journey\u2019s Don\u2019t Stop Believin\u2019 a second wind), \u201cjazz hands\u201d musical theatre and pop covers \u2013 briefly dominated popular culture, with a record 207 singles in the US charts in its six years. The self-referential jokes and witty one-liners \u2013 mostly from Jane Lynch\u2019s savage cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester \u2013 made the bizarre storylines easier to swallow, and a cast of arguably unlikable characters easier to root for. But with the majority of the actors edging closer to their 30s with every season, it was clear that obnoxious Streisand wannabe Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) and co couldn\u2019t stay in high school for ever. And, when they finally graduated, all sense of self-awareness exited stage left.

The team\u2019s efforts had concentrated on identifying all of the vessels sunk during the June 1942 engagement that cost the lives of 2,000 Japanese and 300 Americans.</p> \n<p>The expedition\u2019s director of undersea operations Rob Kraft and Naval History and Heritage Command historian Frank Thompson reviewed high-frequency sonar images of the warship on Sunday before asserting that its dimensions and location meant it had to be the carrier Akagi.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e1d9122602d5fe78463f91ea175cffef2aa63bf\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e1d9122602d5fe78463f91ea175cffef2aa63bf/0_158_2540_1524/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Images of the Japanese aircraft carrier Kaga, off Midway Atoll in the Northwestern Hawaiian islands.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Images of the Japanese aircraft carrier Kaga, off Midway Atoll in the Northwestern Hawaiian islands.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Caleb Jones/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The Akagi was found in 5,490 metres (18,011 ft) of water and more than 1,300 miles (2,090km) north-west of Pearl Harbor.</p> \n<p>A high-frequency sonar image of the wreck site, taken by the research vessel\u2019s underwater drone, shows the huge carrier lying broken on the sea bed amid debris, but otherwise remarkably intact.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure of what we\u2019re seeing here, the dimensions that we\u2019re able to derive from this image (are) conclusive,\u201d Kraft said. \u201cIt can be none other than Akagi.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s sitting upright on her keel, we can see the bow, we can see the stern clearly, you can see some of the gun emplacements on there, you can see that some of the flight deck is also torn up and missing so you can actually look right into where the flight deck would be,\u201d said Kraft.</p> \n<p>The 33,000-tonne ship was first laid down as a heavy battlecruiser but quickly converted into a carrier, serving as the flagship for V-Adm Ch\u016bichi Nagumo during the surprise attack on the US Pacific fleet at Pearl Harbor, and the raids on Darwin and Colombo.</p> \n<p>A year later, ordered to engage and destroy the US carrier threat in the Pacific, Japanese forces settled on the invasion and occupation of Midway atoll as a lure, an action that would change the course of the war in the Pacific.</p> \n<p>Fought largely at the operating limits of the two carrier fleets\u2019 aircraft, and with errors made on both sides, the Japanese were unaware the US navy had broken its codes and underestimated the forces Americans could muster.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3c1eca9e1eea87ec0f3194600ae16f9ce21e5bf9\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c1eca9e1eea87ec0f3194600ae16f9ce21e5bf9/0_229_2779_1667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Japanese heavy cruiser of the Mogami class lies low in the water after being bombed by US naval aircraft during the Battle of Midway.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Japanese heavy cruiser of the Mogami class lies low in the water after being bombed by US naval aircraft during the Battle of Midway.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>An unsuccessful attack by waves of US torpedo bombers was followed by attacks by US dive bombers which struck the Kaga first and then the Akagi, forcing the damaged flagship to be scuttled with Japanese torpedoes after the loss of 267 men.</p> \n<p>The battle saw Japan lose almost two-thirds of its fleet\u2019s aircraft carriers and many of its most experienced fliers, a setback from which the country \u2013 lacking the industrial base of the US, not least in steel production \u2013 would never recover.</p> \n<p>The discovery of the Akagi comes hard on the heels of the Kaga, last week, sunk by the same dive bombers from the USS Enterprise who would sink the Akagi.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe read about the battles, we know what happened.

      "bodyText": "Marine archaeologists believe they have identified the wreck of the Japanese aircraft carrier the Akagi, which was sunk during the second world war\u2019s battle of Midway, regarded by some historians as one of the most consequential naval engagements in history. In the space of a week naval historians with the research vessel Petrel announced that they had discovered the remains of two of the four Japanese carriers that were sunk during the battle. The team\u2019s efforts had concentrated on identifying all of the vessels sunk during the June 1942 engagement that cost the lives of 2,000 Japanese and 300 Americans. The expedition\u2019s director of undersea operations Rob Kraft and Naval History and Heritage Command historian Frank Thompson reviewed high-frequency sonar images of the warship on Sunday before asserting that its dimensions and location meant it had to be the carrier Akagi. The Akagi was found in 5,490 metres (18,011 ft) of water and more than 1,300 miles (2,090km) north-west of Pearl Harbor. A high-frequency sonar image of the wreck site, taken by the research vessel\u2019s underwater drone, shows the huge carrier lying broken on the sea bed amid debris, but otherwise remarkably intact. \u201cI\u2019m sure of what we\u2019re seeing here, the dimensions that we\u2019re able to derive from this image (are) conclusive,\u201d Kraft said. \u201cIt can be none other than Akagi.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s sitting upright on her keel, we can see the bow, we can see the stern clearly, you can see some of the gun emplacements on there, you can see that some of the flight deck is also torn up and missing so you can actually look right into where the flight deck would be,\u201d said Kraft. The 33,000-tonne ship was first laid down as a heavy battlecruiser but quickly converted into a carrier, serving as the flagship for V-Adm Ch\u016bichi Nagumo during the surprise attack on the US Pacific fleet at Pearl Harbor, and the raids on Darwin and Colombo. A year later, ordered to engage and destroy the US carrier threat in the Pacific, Japanese forces settled on the invasion and occupation of Midway atoll as a lure, an action that would change the course of the war in the Pacific. Fought largely at the operating limits of the two carrier fleets\u2019 aircraft, and with errors made on both sides, the Japanese were unaware the US navy had broken its codes and underestimated the forces Americans could muster. An unsuccessful attack by waves of US torpedo bombers was followed by attacks by US dive bombers which struck the Kaga first and then the Akagi, forcing the damaged flagship to be scuttled with Japanese torpedoes after the loss of 267 men. The battle saw Japan lose almost two-thirds of its fleet\u2019s aircraft carriers and many of its most experienced fliers, a setback from which the country \u2013 lacking the industrial base of the US, not least in steel production \u2013 would never recover. The discovery of the Akagi comes hard on the heels of the Kaga, last week, sunk by the same dive bombers from the USS Enterprise who would sink the Akagi. \u201cWe read about the battles, we know what happened. But when you see these wrecks on the bottom of the ocean and everything, you kind of get a feel for what the real price is for war,\u201d said Thompson, who is onboard the Petrel. \u201cYou see the damage these things took, and it\u2019s humbling to watch some of the video of these vessels because they\u2019re war graves.\u201d The expedition is an effort launched by the late Paul Allen, the billionaire co-founder of Microsoft. For years, the crew of the 76-metre (250ft) Petrel has worked with the US navy and other officials around the world to locate and document sunken ships. It has found more than 30 vessels so far.",

      "body": "<p>As political officials at the US Department of the Interior were settling into their new jobs in April 2017, a conservative lawyer named Jonathan Wood started a campaign of emails and calls over a pair of petitions he had filed on behalf of cattle ranchers and business interests.</p> <p>The petitions asked the department to roll back a key regulation under the Endangered Species Act. The regulation, known as the blanket 4(d) rule, provides threatened species with strong protections, but is also reviled by ranchers, mining interests and developers. Like his clients, Wood, a senior lawyer at the Pacific Legal Foundation (PLF), wanted to get rid of it.<br><br>Ranchers oppose the law because it can limit their ability to access grazing resources on public and private lands and control predators like grizzly bears and grey wolves.</p> <p>\u201cIt has been a little over a year since the petitions were filed and I was hoping to find out whether they\u2019re being considered, or if there\u2019s any additional info I can provide to help the administration make its decision,\u201d Wood wrote to officials, according to documents obtained by the Guardian through a Freedom of Information Act request.</p> <p>After multiple inquiries over many months, Wood ultimately got an audience with Daniel Jorjani, a former adviser to the billionaire Koch brothers who now serves as the interior department\u2019s top lawyer. According to public records, Woods and Jorjani scheduled a meeting on 9 April 2018 to discuss in detail Wood\u2019s petitions to roll back protections for threatened species.</p> <p>Little more than three months after Jorjani and Wood met, the interior department would officially unveil a proposal to do what Wood and his clients wanted.

With deep connections to commercial interests, including big agriculture, PLF has long enjoyed funding from some of the wealthiest entities and individuals in the US, who are drawn to the firm\u2019s libertarian free-market philosophy. According to a 1999 article in the Washington Post, Richard Mellon Scaife, the conservative billionaire heir to the Mellon family fortune who died in 2014, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1999/05/02/how-scaifes-money-powered-a-movement/a7e2f9bf-2b5c-4efa-92fd-eb30431fcaa1/\">provided the group</a> with \u201cat least half the group\u2019s budget in its early years\u201d.</p> <p>Over the years PLF has received support from <a href=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/news/12102016/fossil-fuel-oil-companies-coal-gas-climate-change-denial-responsibility-exxon-mobil-chevron-peabody\">ExxonMobil</a> and a slew of arch-conservative foundations. The Adolph Coors Foundation \u2013 founded by the Colorado-based family of beer brewing fame \u2013 provided the group with at least <a href=\"https://naturalresources.house.gov/imo/media/doc/Pacific%20Legal%20Fund%20Donor%20Memo.pdf\">$580,000</a> between 2010 and 2016, according to tax documents seen by the Guardian. In that same time period, PLF took more than $600,000 from the Searle Freedom Trust, a foundation set up by Daniel Searle, a now-deceased Illinois-based executive involved in the pharmaceutical and agriculture industries. It has also received donations from entities like the Charles Koch Foundation and Donors Capital Fund, a donor-advised fund that has been described as the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/02/donors-trust-donor-capital-fund-dark-money-koch-bradley-devos/\">dark-money ATM of the conservative movement</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Investigative journalist Jane Mayer claims these wealthy foundations, and others like them, have spent huge sums of money in recent decades funding a network of conservative legal, academic and political institutions across the US. According to Mayer\u2019s book, Dark Money, they have done so in an effort to challenge \u201cthe widely accepted post-second world war consensus that an activist government was a force for public good. Instead, they [argue] for \u2018limited government\u2019, drastically lower personal and corporate taxes, minimal social services for the needy, and much less oversight of industry, particularly in the environmental arena.\u201d</p> <p>The Endangered Species Act, a powerful environmental statute that grants the government immense authority to limit industrial development, was always a key target of this effort to rollback the regulatory state. The law is anathema to some conservatives because it has the power to restrict human activity on entire landscapes in order to protect species like the grey wolf, the grizzly bear and the bald eagle.

      "bodyText": "As political officials at the US Department of the Interior were settling into their new jobs in April 2017, a conservative lawyer named Jonathan Wood started a campaign of emails and calls over a pair of petitions he had filed on behalf of cattle ranchers and business interests. The petitions asked the department to roll back a key regulation under the Endangered Species Act. The regulation, known as the blanket 4(d) rule, provides threatened species with strong protections, but is also reviled by ranchers, mining interests and developers. Like his clients, Wood, a senior lawyer at the Pacific Legal Foundation (PLF), wanted to get rid of it. Ranchers oppose the law because it can limit their ability to access grazing resources on public and private lands and control predators like grizzly bears and grey wolves. \u201cIt has been a little over a year since the petitions were filed and I was hoping to find out whether they\u2019re being considered, or if there\u2019s any additional info I can provide to help the administration make its decision,\u201d Wood wrote to officials, according to documents obtained by the Guardian through a Freedom of Information Act request. After multiple inquiries over many months, Wood ultimately got an audience with Daniel Jorjani, a former adviser to the billionaire Koch brothers who now serves as the interior department\u2019s top lawyer. According to public records, Woods and Jorjani scheduled a meeting on 9 April 2018 to discuss in detail Wood\u2019s petitions to roll back protections for threatened species. Little more than three months after Jorjani and Wood met, the interior department would officially unveil a proposal to do what Wood and his clients wanted. The department publicly announced in July 2018 that it planned to eliminate the blanket 4(d) rule as part of a broader effort to water down federal enforcement of the Endangered Species Act. In doing so, the agency garnered national headlines and sent shockwaves through the wildlife conservation community, which denounced the move as an assault on a bedrock environmental law. But Wood\u2019s efforts are part of a bigger picture. Across the US today, a quiet war is taking place. On the one hand, environmental activists, lawyers and citizens are struggling to continue the work begun over a century ago by conservationists: protecting wildlife and the environment, and keeping water clean, species intact and wilderness open. On the other, a network of conservative lawyers, activists and business interests are determined to pursue what they see as equally important American values: the protection of individual rights and the rolling back of government regulations \u2013 especially those relating to commercial enterprise. Their commitment runs deep. Wood has spoken about the childhood experiences that drew him to the cause, describing how he witnessed his father struggling in the real estate business. \u201cMy dad had this dream, from as far back as I can remember. He had a rather large ranch in Texas that he wanted to develop and build small family homes,\u201d Wood explained in a filmed interview for the Liberty Forum. \u201cAnd when I was 10 he finally decided to see if he could pursue his dream.\u201d His father went to the county to see what permits would be required, Wood recounted. \u201cHe came back with a stack of documents that seemed almost as big as I was at the time, and became completely discouraged.\u201d This experience appears to have had a lasting impression on Wood, and he has made a career out of campaigning for the unfettered property interests of private landowners, major industry groups and more. Wood\u2019s firm, the little-known but influential PLF, is a non-profit law firm with about $52m (\u00a340.4m) in net assets as of 2017 and 73 attorneys and staff dedicated to fighting against federal laws and regulations like the Endangered Species Act. Founded in 1973 by a group composed mainly of Ronald Reagan\u2019s former staff, and headquartered in Sacramento, California, PLF describes itself as \u201cthe first public interest law firm dedicated to the principles of individual rights and limited government\u201d. With deep connections to commercial interests, including big agriculture, PLF has long enjoyed funding from some of the wealthiest entities and individuals in the US, who are drawn to the firm\u2019s libertarian free-market philosophy. According to a 1999 article in the Washington Post, Richard Mellon Scaife, the conservative billionaire heir to the Mellon family fortune who died in 2014, provided the group with \u201cat least half the group\u2019s budget in its early years\u201d. Over the years PLF has received support from ExxonMobil and a slew of arch-conservative foundations. The Adolph Coors Foundation \u2013 founded by the Colorado-based family of beer brewing fame \u2013 provided the group with at least $580,000 between 2010 and 2016, according to tax documents seen by the Guardian. In that same time period, PLF took more than $600,000 from the Searle Freedom Trust, a foundation set up by Daniel Searle, a now-deceased Illinois-based executive involved in the pharmaceutical and agriculture industries. It has also received donations from entities like the Charles Koch Foundation and Donors Capital Fund, a donor-advised fund that has been described as the \u201cdark-money ATM of the conservative movement\u201d. Investigative journalist Jane Mayer claims these wealthy foundations, and others like them, have spent huge sums of money in recent decades funding a network of conservative legal, academic and political institutions across the US. According to Mayer\u2019s book, Dark Money, they have done so in an effort to challenge \u201cthe widely accepted post-second world war consensus that an activist government was a force for public good. Instead, they [argue] for \u2018limited government\u2019, drastically lower personal and corporate taxes, minimal social services for the needy, and much less oversight of industry, particularly in the environmental arena.\u201d The Endangered Species Act, a powerful environmental statute that grants the government immense authority to limit industrial development, was always a key target of this effort to rollback the regulatory state. The law is anathema to some conservatives because it has the power to restrict human activity on entire landscapes in order to protect species like the grey wolf, the grizzly bear and the bald eagle. If an endangered or threatened species lives in your neck of the woods, the US government may no longer allow you to graze cattle, drill for oil, or develop real estate wherever you please. The Pacific Legal Foundation is not the only right-leaning legal group that targets the Endangered Species Act \u2013 others include the Mountain States Legal Foundation and the Texas Public Policy Foundation, both of which have received money from some of the same conservative funders that back PLF. PLF\u2019s goal is to methodically change US laws in ways that weaken government power, according to John Echeverria, a professor at the Vermont Law School and a long-time observer of PLF. Its ultimate objective, he says, is to overturn long-standing precedents that prop up statutes like the Endangered Species Act, or at least render such laws ineffective on constitutional and procedural groups. \u201cThey are very patient,\u201d he says, \u201cand they are focused on the long-term.\u201d In a 2017 testimony submitted to the House natural resources committee, Wood said the act \u201cis known as the \u2018pit bull\u2019 of environmental law. And for good reason. As many economic-development and infrastructure projects proponents have learned the hard way, once the Endangered Species Act sinks its teeth into you, it does not let go easily.\u201d In other writings, Wood has criticised the law\u2019s \u201cburdensome \u2013 and controversial \u2013 regulations on property owners\u201d and the \u201cimmense costs\u201d of its \u201ccommand-and-control approach\u201d. To combat what it views as intrusive government overreach, PLF has filed lawsuits against the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and other government agencies that enforce the Endangered Species Act. PLF\u2019s attorneys have sued on behalf of the Texas Farm Bureau to strip protections from a small bird called the black-capped vireo. They are suing on behalf of New Mexico livestock interests to roll back critical habitat protections for the endangered jaguar. They have sued on behalf of Idaho ranchers to challenge the federal government\u2019s greater sage grouse conservation plans. They have filed a flurry of briefs in support of other anti-Environmental Species Act lawsuits. And they regularly write comment pieces, appear in the media, and testify in front of legislative bodies to attack the law. As of 2017, according to tax forms, PLF was working on more than 15 cases meant to roll back, block, weaken or otherwise alter state and federal wildlife protections, many of them on behalf of farmers, ranchers and landowners in the West. With Big Ag and other corporate interests by its side, PLF\u2019s attorneys employ a variety of tactics to combat the Environmental Species Act. One tactic is its use of petitions and lawsuits to try to force the FWS to remove specific species from the endangered species list. The organisation has been working since at least 2014 to force the agency to delist the imperilled coastal California gnatcatcher, a small grey songbird that lives in coastal sage scrub in the southern part of California. On behalf of a group of property owners, agriculture groups and other business interests, PLF filed a lawsuit against FWS, arguing that the threatened gnatcatcher is not a scientifically-valid subspecies and so is not entitled to protection under the Environmental Species Act. This is just a taste of the litigation PLF regularly pursues. The organisation has petitioned or litigated to remove, weaken or deny protections for many different species, including the golden parakeet, the Preble\u2019s meadow jumping mouse, the black-capped vireo, the lesser long-nosed bat, the gypsum wild-buckwheat, the wood stork, the West Indian manatee and the wolverine \u2013 a highly imperilled animal that is threatened by both human development and the climate crisis. PLF brought a number of these cases on behalf of agriculture industry clients, including the Farm Bureau Federation and ranchers\u2019 associations. PLF\u2019s lawyers are some of the most tenacious opponents of endangered species protections in the US. By picking sympathetic clients, and bringing cases in different jurisdictions across the country, the group is working hard to fundamentally alter, if not debilitate, America\u2019s most famous wildlife conservation law, which currently protects some 1,600 imperilled species in the US in an era when wildlife extinction is on the rise globally. Patrick Parenteau, a professor at the Vermont Law School who specialises in endangered species issues, calls PLF \u201ca mouthpiece for agriculture and other industries that are the primary cause of habitat loss and species endangerment\u201d. But Jim Huffman, an emeritus dean and professor at Lewis and Clark Law School, as well a member of the conservative Federalist Society, argues that the PLF should be seen as a pro-property rights \u201ccounterbalance\u201d to environmental litigation groups like the Sierra Club and the Environmental Defense Fund. \u201cThey, like the environmental litigation groups, are out to establish precedent or overturn precedent,\u201d he says. \u201cThey, like the environmental litigation groups, select their cases based on what they perceive to be the likelihood of establishing useful precedent.\u201d The PLF, for its part, has been celebrating some major victories in the Trump era.

      "bodyText": "Christian Porter has called for GetUp to be classified as a related body of Labor and blasted it for allegedly misleading voters throughout the election campaign. The attorney general has joined Liberal MPs including Kevin Andrews in complaining about GetUp\u2019s conduct to the parliamentary inquiry examining the 2019 election. In two separate submissions the Liberal MP Jason Falinski has suggested Australia move to use optional preferential voting in elections and joined a unity ticket with the independent MP Zali Steggall in calling for truth in political advertising laws. The Greens backed calls for a body other than the Australian Electoral Commission to oversee election ads, and agreed with civil society groups that want spending caps on elections. In his submission \u2013 partially redacted by the joint standing committee on electoral matters \u2013 Porter alleged that GetUp instructed volunteers to tell voters that he had given six-figure salaries to \u201cLiberal party colleagues and donors, including after one of them gave him a free campaign bus\u201d. He said the ABC article cited for the claim does not substantiate it, nor even contain any reference to the word \u201cbus\u201d. Porter appointed the ex-state Liberal politician Joe Francis to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal along with 13 other former Coalition MPs and staffers. But Porter said the Liberal party had agreed to purchase three campaign buses from a Western Australian company managed by Francis before the appointment was made and the buses weren\u2019t free. Porter also disputed GetUp\u2019s characterisation of his position on creating a national integrity commission, but said that attempting to force retractions by GetUp was judged impractical and unaffordable during the campaign for his marginal seat of Pearce. He called for GetUp to be classified as an associated entity of Labor \u2013 something the AEC has considered and rejected on three occasions. Andrews submitted that he was able to force GetUp to withdraw a claim it made about him by threatening defamation proceedings, and claimed voters at polling booths felt \u201cintimidated and harassed\u201d by the group. He proposed that handing out how-to-vote cards at polling places should be restricted to representatives of registered candidates. Falinski suggested a move to optional preferential voting coupled with electronic voting, arguing it was \u201cimmoral to force a voter to vote for someone they do not wish to\u201d and would eliminate the \u201cstress\u201d of voters having to decide their preferences. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In the joint submission with Steggall, the pair complained that the AEC was unable to stop misleading and deceptive conduct in elections, resulting in \u201cinsidious scare campaigns\u201d such as Labor\u2019s Mediscare campaign claiming the Coalition would privatise Medicare. \u201cAt a time when the confidence of Australians in our political system is at critically low levels we must take decisive action to defend the integrity of democracy in our country and act with the moral determination and courage that the Australian people expect of us,\u201d they said. The Greens recommended an independent body be established to implement new truth in political advertising laws, and noted that the ACCC already had similar expertise judging misleading and deceptive claims in commercial advertising. The Greens also called for \u201creasonable caps on campaign expenditure by political parties, candidates, and registered third parties\u201d, fixed three-year terms of parliament and tighter rules around taxpayer-funded advertising in the lead-up to elections. In other submissions Coalition MPs have called for a shorter pre-poll period and Labor has suggested the social media giants should be subjected to more scrutiny for failing to take down false material. In its submission, the AEC defended its handling of early voting by noting that pre-poll is legislated to commence the fifth day after the declaration of nominations and pre-poll began just a day earlier in 2019 compared with the 2013 and 2016 federal elections. The number of pre-poll votes rose from 22.7% of total votes cast in 2016 to 32.5% at the May election.

      "body": "<p>The other day I opened a book to find a sentence, and a bit of paper fell out. As the square piece of block pad glided to the floor like a dead moth, I recognised it as a recipe for a ring cake written out for me not long after coming to Italy, about 14 years ago. I remember making the recipe several times, before using it as a bookmark that was left at page 76. What I don\u2019t remember or recognise is whose neat writing it is.</p> <p>My memory lapse is frustrating. Sharing a recipe is an open-handed act, one made even more tangible if the person sharing has taken the time physically to write it out, maybe with notes, which is a small labour in these copy-and-photograph times.</p> <p>Even if the recipe given is never made, I want to remember where the Post-It lemon pudding or back-of-envelope braised chicken came from. And if the recipe becomes part of my cooking life, it is no different from a recipe from a book or famous chef: it absolutely must have that person attached to it, like a name tag sewn into a collar. Then, every time the recipe is made, the person and your relationship to them, whatever it was, is remembered. Even if it means you have to relive a tired exchange about authenticity, or be reminded that Mario subsequently left his wife for his secretary, recipes have names: Mario\u2019s red-wine risotto; my elegant neighbour Vera\u2019s creme caramel; Lise from Bavaria\u2019s liver and apple.</p> <p>Shared name-tagged recipes are also a way of marking time. Years ago, I organised my mum\u2019s loose recipes, gluing the loose-leaf pages and lips of envelopes into a book and noting where and who they came from.

      "bodyText": "The other day I opened a book to find a sentence, and a bit of paper fell out. As the square piece of block pad glided to the floor like a dead moth, I recognised it as a recipe for a ring cake written out for me not long after coming to Italy, about 14 years ago. I remember making the recipe several times, before using it as a bookmark that was left at page 76. What I don\u2019t remember or recognise is whose neat writing it is. My memory lapse is frustrating. Sharing a recipe is an open-handed act, one made even more tangible if the person sharing has taken the time physically to write it out, maybe with notes, which is a small labour in these copy-and-photograph times. Even if the recipe given is never made, I want to remember where the Post-It lemon pudding or back-of-envelope braised chicken came from. And if the recipe becomes part of my cooking life, it is no different from a recipe from a book or famous chef: it absolutely must have that person attached to it, like a name tag sewn into a collar. Then, every time the recipe is made, the person and your relationship to them, whatever it was, is remembered. Even if it means you have to relive a tired exchange about authenticity, or be reminded that Mario subsequently left his wife for his secretary, recipes have names: Mario\u2019s red-wine risotto; my elegant neighbour Vera\u2019s creme caramel; Lise from Bavaria\u2019s liver and apple. Shared name-tagged recipes are also a way of marking time. Years ago, I organised my mum\u2019s loose recipes, gluing the loose-leaf pages and lips of envelopes into a book and noting where and who they came from. The book is now a sort of collective biography of our family \u2013 a strained one. Freda Coleman was a neighbour in the late 1970s, and her marmalade cake marks the margarine years. It was, and is, an ideal cake for a family with congenital marmalade dependency: a rich pound batter into which you stir orange marmalade, which bakes into a bitter-sweet cake. The icing is as good as the cake, which you zig- zag over the top where it then sets into a hard lattice that can be pulled off, although hopefully not from the entire cake as once happened. Part of the pleasure of a cake is the smell as it bakes: marmalade bakes into an almost toffee-like sweetness, and hopefully a bit of peel at the bottom of the cake catches and the smell of that, like dark treacle, assaults your senses. Recipes are only recipes, but they can become fixed points in our lives around which other things move: with them, we can measure time, places, people.

      "body": "<p>If there is one thing England must do if they are going to beat New Zealand and reach the World Cup final it is to deny them quick ball. Ireland were not able to do that in the first half and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/oct/19/new-zealand-ireland-world-cup-quarter-final\" title=\"\">New Zealand had a field day</a>. The game was in effect over by half-time because the All Blacks bossed the breakdown.</p> <p>I have 100% belief that England are capable of that. It is not entirely reliant on Tom Curry and Sam Underhill but judging by their performances against Australia they are more than able to deny New Zealand the kind of ball they thrive on. It is not always turnovers \u2013 it is often just slowing the ball down because that has such an impact on the depth of the opposition\u2019s attack. Ireland could not do that because the All Black back-row trio of Sam Cane, Kieran Read and Ardie Savea were totally dominant. I thought Read in particular answered all those questioning his form, as shown when he blasted through Rory Best from a standing start.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/20/new-zealand-ultimate-challenge-england-eddie-jones\">New Zealand are ultimate challenge but England can face them down</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We always tend to see three seconds as the benchmark. Anything faster than that is quick ball but as Australia ran out of steam against England that would have been up around four. The difference between that and how quickly New Zealand were recycling was marked and that meant forwards such as Brodie Retallick and Joe Moody were running on to the ball and winning collisions. Ireland, on the other hand, had to check their runs and often received the ball when stationary.</p> <p>I was also very impressed with New Zealand\u2019s defence. It isn\u2019t talked about all that much; most people concentrate on their attack, their ability to create things, to be ruthless from opponents\u2019 mistakes, but their defence was first-class against Ireland. I saw an extra edge to their line speed. There was not a lot of creativity from Ireland which made it easier, but New Zealand\u2019s tight five \u2013 notably Retallick, Sam Whitelock, Moody \u2013 put a lot of pressure on their attack and they lost all their go-forward. We\u2019re going to see two extremely well-organised defences and it will be fascinating to watch both of them try to nullify each other\u2019s attack.</p> <p>I can\u2019t see England changing their ways for one moment. This is knockout rugby and because of that it is hard to argue with Eddie Jones moving Owen Farrell back to fly-half, particularly with the benefit of hindsight considering how well he played. England will kick accurately, put pressure on New Zealand\u2019s wings and Beauden Barrett at full-back and they will look to squeeze, suffocate and strangle. I imagine their line speed will go up another notch \u2013 they\u2019ve been flirting with the offside line but they are not getting called up on it so of course they should keep doing it until they are pinged and then adjust.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/19/weve-not-played-our-best-england-can-improve-eddie-jones-tells-new-zealand\" title=\"\">England will also target the set piece</a>. New Zealand\u2019s scrum has been rock-solid but I do believe the lineout is an area where England will think they can have some joy. I would not be surprised in the slightest to see George Kruis come back into the side because he is their top lineout caller. They will look to control territory and keep the ball in the right areas of the field, so being able to disrupt New Zealand\u2019s lineout could be very significant.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/20/steve-hansen-all-blacks-new-zealand-england-eddie-jones-beer\">\u2018We\u2019ll have a beer\u2019: Steve Hansen and Eddie Jones swap texts before semi-final</a> </p> </aside>  <p>New Zealand, on the other hand, will be waiting for the game to become unstructured. They will have to be patient but their ability to do that against Ireland impressed me. They did not force things; they realised when the momentum had been lost and they just needed to keep chipping away until it built back up again and then strike.</p> <p>The decisive factor will be whether New Zealand can stop England\u2019s power game and what happens if they do. Looking back at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jun/24/new-zealand-british-and-irish-lions-first-test-player-ratings\" title=\"\">the first Test</a> of the British &amp; Irish Lions tour two years ago, all the talk was that the Lions had the edge up front but that is where the All Blacks took them on and why they won the game. If England cannot get their power game going, get their big carriers over the gain line and get the ball wide after two or three phases, then I wonder how they will react. Only George Ford has the creativity and the ability to up the tempo from the bench, so there will be a huge onus on him if that does happen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"798cdb3b12dde32ad0c87c3628c93aac4f00b51c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/798cdb3b12dde32ad0c87c3628c93aac4f00b51c/0_6_3637_2182/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George Ford, who did not start against Australia, is the only England player with the creativity and ability to up the tempo from the bench.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Ford, who did not start against Australia, is the only England player with the creativity and ability to up the tempo from the bench.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christophe Simon/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What New Zealand cannot allow to happen is for England to start building a lead. As Farrell alluded to after the Australia match, England did what they needed to do once they had got themselves in front. It is not always pretty but it works, especially in a World Cup semi-final.</p> <p>As a result I expect New Zealand to have a massive focus on slowing down England\u2019s power game. They\u2019ll be getting off the line and trying to spook the distributors and ensuring that the ball does not get to the outside channels. They will in effect try to say to England: \u2018That isn\u2019t working, so what else have you got? How can you cope if the game becomes unstructured?\u2019 England do have players who can cope well \u2013 I think of Jonny May and Anthony Watson \u2013 but I just wonder whether they have enough experience of knowing exactly how to handle it on this kind of stage.</p> <p>I\u2019m backing the boys in black but if I\u2019m being honest it\u2019s the toss of a coin. It\u2019s such an evenly matched semi-final \u2013 a classic North versus South battle \u2013 and whichever team are able to impose their style of how they want the game to be played will end up in the final. I can\u2019t wait.</p>",

      "bodyText": "If there is one thing England must do if they are going to beat New Zealand and reach the World Cup final it is to deny them quick ball. Ireland were not able to do that in the first half and New Zealand had a field day. The game was in effect over by half-time because the All Blacks bossed the breakdown. I have 100% belief that England are capable of that. It is not entirely reliant on Tom Curry and Sam Underhill but judging by their performances against Australia they are more than able to deny New Zealand the kind of ball they thrive on. It is not always turnovers \u2013 it is often just slowing the ball down because that has such an impact on the depth of the opposition\u2019s attack. Ireland could not do that because the All Black back-row trio of Sam Cane, Kieran Read and Ardie Savea were totally dominant. I thought Read in particular answered all those questioning his form, as shown when he blasted through Rory Best from a standing start. We always tend to see three seconds as the benchmark. Anything faster than that is quick ball but as Australia ran out of steam against England that would have been up around four. The difference between that and how quickly New Zealand were recycling was marked and that meant forwards such as Brodie Retallick and Joe Moody were running on to the ball and winning collisions. Ireland, on the other hand, had to check their runs and often received the ball when stationary. I was also very impressed with New Zealand\u2019s defence. It isn\u2019t talked about all that much; most people concentrate on their attack, their ability to create things, to be ruthless from opponents\u2019 mistakes, but their defence was first-class against Ireland. I saw an extra edge to their line speed. There was not a lot of creativity from Ireland which made it easier, but New Zealand\u2019s tight five \u2013 notably Retallick, Sam Whitelock, Moody \u2013 put a lot of pressure on their attack and they lost all their go-forward. We\u2019re going to see two extremely well-organised defences and it will be fascinating to watch both of them try to nullify each other\u2019s attack. I can\u2019t see England changing their ways for one moment. This is knockout rugby and because of that it is hard to argue with Eddie Jones moving Owen Farrell back to fly-half, particularly with the benefit of hindsight considering how well he played. England will kick accurately, put pressure on New Zealand\u2019s wings and Beauden Barrett at full-back and they will look to squeeze, suffocate and strangle. I imagine their line speed will go up another notch \u2013 they\u2019ve been flirting with the offside line but they are not getting called up on it so of course they should keep doing it until they are pinged and then adjust. England will also target the set piece. New Zealand\u2019s scrum has been rock-solid but I do believe the lineout is an area where England will think they can have some joy. I would not be surprised in the slightest to see George Kruis come back into the side because he is their top lineout caller. They will look to control territory and keep the ball in the right areas of the field, so being able to disrupt New Zealand\u2019s lineout could be very significant. New Zealand, on the other hand, will be waiting for the game to become unstructured. They will have to be patient but their ability to do that against Ireland impressed me. They did not force things; they realised when the momentum had been lost and they just needed to keep chipping away until it built back up again and then strike. The decisive factor will be whether New Zealand can stop England\u2019s power game and what happens if they do. Looking back at the first Test of the British &amp; Irish Lions tour two years ago, all the talk was that the Lions had the edge up front but that is where the All Blacks took them on and why they won the game. If England cannot get their power game going, get their big carriers over the gain line and get the ball wide after two or three phases, then I wonder how they will react. Only George Ford has the creativity and the ability to up the tempo from the bench, so there will be a huge onus on him if that does happen. What New Zealand cannot allow to happen is for England to start building a lead. As Farrell alluded to after the Australia match, England did what they needed to do once they had got themselves in front. It is not always pretty but it works, especially in a World Cup semi-final. As a result I expect New Zealand to have a massive focus on slowing down England\u2019s power game. They\u2019ll be getting off the line and trying to spook the distributors and ensuring that the ball does not get to the outside channels. They will in effect try to say to England: \u2018That isn\u2019t working, so what else have you got? How can you cope if the game becomes unstructured?\u2019 England do have players who can cope well \u2013 I think of Jonny May and Anthony Watson \u2013 but I just wonder whether they have enough experience of knowing exactly how to handle it on this kind of stage. I\u2019m backing the boys in black but if I\u2019m being honest it\u2019s the toss of a coin. It\u2019s such an evenly matched semi-final \u2013 a classic North versus South battle \u2013 and whichever team are able to impose their style of how they want the game to be played will end up in the final. I can\u2019t wait.",

The side hustle is a way to make money from a hobby or skill and comes in many forms, from artwork to running a start-up. They can provide relief for those under financial stress \u2013 but they can also leave students thinly stretched.</p> <p>Oxford PhD student Chelsea Haith was already spending the main portion of her day on her laptop, so she reasoned that taking up \u201cchoose-your-hours\u201d work moderating messages for a dating app would fit well around her research. The customer service role complemented her experience giving pastoral support to postgraduate students.</p> <p>\u201cThe faster you work, the more you get paid,\u201d she says. \u201cI would get up at five in the morning and moderate until nine, when Oxford\u2019s libraries open. That\u2019s when the American time zone kicked in and most people were active.\u201d But working alongside a PhD took its toll. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t overwhelmingly nice to customer service staff.

But while they show enterprise, these gigs can be symptomatic of growing financial pressures. A national survey by Save the Student <a href=\"https://www.savethestudent.org/money/student-money-survey-2019.html\">found</a> that the student maintenance loan falls \u00a3267 short of the average student\u2019s monthly living costs. Two thirds of students have a part-time job, while half of working students say their studies suffer as a result.</p> <p>In reality, students\u2019 passion projects often aren\u2019t viable sources of income. Caitlin Powell got into standup during her gap year and joined the comedy society at the University of York. A promoter saw her perform and gave her her first paid gig. \u201cGigging became my socialising time, as well as providing some all-important cash.\u201d But, Powell says, it was impossible to commit enough to comedy for it to support her as a sideline to study. \u201cIt\u2019s tough, when you do other jobs, to explain to managers why you can\u2019t work late on certain evenings. Some have been very understanding but others will just put you on shift anyway, so you have to cancel gigs.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, some students are taking more extreme measures to make ends meet. Four percent of respondents to the Save the Student survey said they pay their way with adult work (any job that involves nudity or erotica) \u2013 up from 2% in 2017. Eight percent said they made money through gambling.</p> <p>Jake Butler, a money expert from Save the Student, says: \u201cThe doubling of students involved in adult and sex work over two years is very concerning. But it\u2019s not all that unexpected, given the financial situation students are put in. Maintenance loans are means-tested, meaning that the government expects parents to plug the gap. But most parents have no idea and their children are forced to desperate measures just to continue their studies.\u201d</p> <p>Some students find themselves resorting to illegal means, like Daniel Rodgers*, who studies with the Open University. He took up selling drugs alongside a bar job when he realised his primary income didn\u2019t cover his rent, bills and council tax. \u201cEven though you\u2019re doing a full-time degree, you can never count as a full-time student, so you don\u2019t get the benefits that normal students do. There\u2019s going to be a point where I find I\u2019ve got two essays due, when I can\u2019t manage shift work. So I buy two ounces of hash and shift little bits to whoever. It\u2019s just on the side, to help pay bills or buy food.\u201d</p> <p>Eva Crossan Jory, vice president of welfare at the National Union of Students, says that marketisation in the higher education sector has made the situation worse.

      "bodyText": "They\u2019re known as \u201cside hustles\u201d, but more often than not, they\u2019re lifelines for students and young people. The side hustle is a way to make money from a hobby or skill and comes in many forms, from artwork to running a start-up. They can provide relief for those under financial stress \u2013 but they can also leave students thinly stretched. Oxford PhD student Chelsea Haith was already spending the main portion of her day on her laptop, so she reasoned that taking up \u201cchoose-your-hours\u201d work moderating messages for a dating app would fit well around her research. The customer service role complemented her experience giving pastoral support to postgraduate students. \u201cThe faster you work, the more you get paid,\u201d she says. \u201cI would get up at five in the morning and moderate until nine, when Oxford\u2019s libraries open. That\u2019s when the American time zone kicked in and most people were active.\u201d But working alongside a PhD took its toll. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t overwhelmingly nice to customer service staff. It had an impact on my academic work, I was exhausted. It doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re doing work towards your own life, but you have to earn money to eat and live.\u201d A recent report called \u201cThe Side Hustle Economy\u201d by the University of Reading found that 34% of those aged 16 to 24 have a money-making sideline of some sort. But while they show enterprise, these gigs can be symptomatic of growing financial pressures. A national survey by Save the Student found that the student maintenance loan falls \u00a3267 short of the average student\u2019s monthly living costs. Two thirds of students have a part-time job, while half of working students say their studies suffer as a result. In reality, students\u2019 passion projects often aren\u2019t viable sources of income. Caitlin Powell got into standup during her gap year and joined the comedy society at the University of York. A promoter saw her perform and gave her her first paid gig. \u201cGigging became my socialising time, as well as providing some all-important cash.\u201d But, Powell says, it was impossible to commit enough to comedy for it to support her as a sideline to study. \u201cIt\u2019s tough, when you do other jobs, to explain to managers why you can\u2019t work late on certain evenings. Some have been very understanding but others will just put you on shift anyway, so you have to cancel gigs.\u201d Meanwhile, some students are taking more extreme measures to make ends meet. Four percent of respondents to the Save the Student survey said they pay their way with adult work (any job that involves nudity or erotica) \u2013 up from 2% in 2017. Eight percent said they made money through gambling. Jake Butler, a money expert from Save the Student, says: \u201cThe doubling of students involved in adult and sex work over two years is very concerning. But it\u2019s not all that unexpected, given the financial situation students are put in. Maintenance loans are means-tested, meaning that the government expects parents to plug the gap. But most parents have no idea and their children are forced to desperate measures just to continue their studies.\u201d Some students find themselves resorting to illegal means, like Daniel Rodgers*, who studies with the Open University. He took up selling drugs alongside a bar job when he realised his primary income didn\u2019t cover his rent, bills and council tax. \u201cEven though you\u2019re doing a full-time degree, you can never count as a full-time student, so you don\u2019t get the benefits that normal students do. There\u2019s going to be a point where I find I\u2019ve got two essays due, when I can\u2019t manage shift work. So I buy two ounces of hash and shift little bits to whoever. It\u2019s just on the side, to help pay bills or buy food.\u201d Eva Crossan Jory, vice president of welfare at the National Union of Students, says that marketisation in the higher education sector has made the situation worse. She suggests the answer is a National Education Service, that would \u201creframe\u201d education as \u201ca service accessible to all\u201d. \u201cAt the end of term, when the money runs out, it\u2019s easy for them to turn to quick fixes such as loans or even gambling. Our research has shown that this just causes further stress and anxiety in the long run,\u201d she says. Other students have called for cuts to university accommodation costs, which soak up the majority of students\u2019 maintenance loans. Clementine Boucher, a student activist at Rent Strike, said: \u201cStudents have accumulated so much debt and their quality of life has deteriorated so much it was impossible not to notice [\u2026] They are really angry, frustrated and depressed by the situation.\u201d *Daniel Rogers is a pseudonym.",

Speaking to journalists in Lyon following his acceptance of the Prix Lumi\u00e8re for his contribution to cinema, Francis Ford Coppola, 80, said: \u201cWhen Martin Scorsese says that the Marvel pictures are not cinema, he\u2019s right because we expect to learn something from cinema, we expect to gain something, some enlightenment, some knowledge, some inspiration.\u201d Coppola continued: \u201cI don\u2019t know that anyone gets anything out of seeing the same movie over and over again. Martin was kind when he said it\u2019s not cinema. He didn\u2019t say it\u2019s despicable, which I just say it is.\u201d Scorsese\u2019s initial comments, in which he said films made by Marvel Studios, the Disney offshoot responsible for the Avengers movies, were \u201cnot cinema\u201d, prompted a considerable backlash from directors including James Gunn, Joss Whedon, Kevin Smith and Taika Waititi. The director of GoodFellas, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and forthcoming mafia epic The Irishman reiterated his feelings last weekend at the London film festival, saying superhero films were \u201cinvading\u201d cinema, which increasingly resembled a \u201ctheme park\u201d. During his David Lean lecture on 12 October, Scorsese said: \u201cTheatres have become amusement parks. That is all fine and good, but don\u2019t invade everything else in that sense. That is fine and good for those who enjoy that type of film and, by the way, knowing what goes into them now, I admire what they do. It\u2019s not my kind of thing, it simply is not. It\u2019s creating another kind of audience that thinks cinema is that.\u201d Gunn also responded to Coppola\u2019s attack on the genre for which he has become famous. Writing on Instagram, the director of Guardians of the Galaxy and its sequel tacitly accused both Scorsese and Coppola of being out of touch and insufficiently open-minded. \u201cNot everyone will be able to appreciate [superhero films],\u201d he wrote, \u201ceven some geniuses.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The prime minister\u2019s department has revealed that a staff member who is working at Scott Morrison\u2019s official residence, and who Labor on Monday alleged in a Senate estimates hearing has links to a conspiracy theorist, is yet to receive a security clearance. Under questioning by Labor senator Penny Wong in the hearing, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet\u2019s first assistant secretary, Gerard Martin, revealed that a staff member employed at Kirribilli House on 12 August \u2013 on the recommendation of the prime minister\u2019s office \u2013 had received a police clearance but was awaiting a security clearance at a \u201cnegative vetting\u201d level 2. That level of clearance permits access to classified information and resources up to and including \u201ctop secret\u201d. Wong asked the department if it wanted to respond to the allegation that a conspiracy theorist who tweets under the handle @BurnedSpy34 was a friend of Morrison, with his wife a member of the prime minister\u2019s staff. She said the conspiracies aired by the theorist were \u201cextraordinary and bizarre\u201d. The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, intervened, saying the question would be taken on notice. \u201cI am not aware of either the circumstances you describe or what is asserted in that particular story,\u201d Cormann said. \u201cI would be disappointed if your suggestion is that a wife couldn\u2019t be appropriately employed because of what may or may not be the activities of her husband, if indeed the activities are accurately reported. \u201cYou are now going to allegations about a family member ... of a staff member which I think goes beyond what I am comfortable dealing with on the spot without properly informing myself of the facts.\u201d Stephanie Foster, an assistant secretary of the department, said a colleague had made her aware of the alleged links to the QAnon conspiracy, but the department had not taken any action. \u201cWe would expect any action, if any action was necessary, would come through either a police check or a security check,\u201d Foster said. The department said that the staff were employed by the department on the recommendation of the prime minister\u2019s office because the workload at Kirribilli House required two additional staff following the change of prime minister. There was no formal advertising process for the positions, and one of the additional household attendants was employed on 12 August after the house manager decided the proposed employee was \u201cfit for purpose\u201d. As reported by the Guardian, the QAnon conspiracy variously claims that Donald Trump is leading a behind-the-scenes fight against a shadowy deep state, that powerful forces are hiding and protecting satanic paedophile rings, and that a secretive individual named Q leaves clues for his followers to decipher on internet forums. The staff member is employed under the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act 1984, meaning the position did not need to be advertised and is tied directly to the relevant minister.",

      "bodyText": "Six men held inside a Papua New Guinean immigration prison have been released and will be sent home, and Australia has no visibility, access or influence over the fate of the 47 remaining inside, Senate estimates has been told. The head of the home affairs department, Michael Pezzullo, also rejected suggestions there is a new border crisis involving people arriving by plane and claiming asylum, with many being exploited by organised crime and illegitimate labour hire companies. At Senate estimates on Monday the head of Australia\u2019s offshore processing regime, Major General Craig Furini, revealed that six men had been released from the Bomana immigration detention centre in Port Moresby. \u201cIt\u2019s my understanding they were released on the basis they\u2019d accepted a voluntary returns package,\u201d Furini said. He said he had no knowledge of the conditions inside the centre where 47 men remained, what access the men had to communications, and said there were no Australian officers there. \u201cWe have no visibility of what goes on inside.\u201d Furini told estimates he didn\u2019t know if any of them were among the 10 detainees who had already been approved for medevac transfer to Australia when they were arrested more than two months ago and detained without means of outside contact. Pezzullo noted PNG\u2019s actions had interrupted planned medical care. \u201cIt is the one point of intersection whereby the operation of Australian law touches activities undertaken in accordance with PNG law,\u201d Pezzullo said. \u201cIf medevac requests come in under the relevant subsection of 198, but the person is held in detention or otherwise not able to be released for transfer \u2026 this is an issue we need to work through diplomatically.\u201d He added this was an issue for Nauru as well, which has notoriously refused Australian medical transfer requests. Guardian Australia understands the Nauruan government continues to block medevac transfers. The committee heard that as of Monday morning 341 medevac applications had been made, and 135 transferred. The number included 14 reapplications after they failed for apparent paperwork problems. Over the course of the bill being in place 13 people have been hospitalised in Australia, nine for less than seven days. Pezzullo said there was no mechanism to return people who had finished treatment or were assessed as not requiring any. Earlier, Pezzullo addressed recent reports and comments by the shadow home affairs minister, Kristina Keneally, about more than 95,000 people who arrived by plane seeking asylum in the past five years, and said they did not reflect the department\u2019s experience. Keneally has used the figures to say the Coalition has lost control of its borders. On Monday Pezzullo said he had seen a border crisis before, citing the tens of thousands of boat arrivals and related deaths at sea, and \u201cthis is not a border crisis, I can assure you\u201d. Keneally tabled a report by the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, which said while Australia met minimum standards of addressing human trafficking, it was not successful in many areas. She suggested an earlier comment by Pezzullo \u2013 that the US administration wanted what Australia had \u2013 was wrong. Pezzullo rejected the suggestion, and said he was with the US state department \u201cjust two weeks ago\u201d and they had that \u201cexact discussion\u201d. He said Australia\u2019s points-based process, which underpinned a managed immigration, and the universal visa system is \u201cexplicitly\u201d what the US administration wants to achieve. \u201cIn terms of targeting human traffickers, the evidence we see in the field \u2026 does not bear out anything other than this assessment. And in the case where it has occurred it\u2019s despicable, it\u2019s abhorrent.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning More than 84% of the 95,000 asylum applicants who arrived by air were found not to have a valid claim, which Keneally has previously said was an indicator of labour exploitation risks. On Thursday Keneally read the opening paragraph of the Coalition MP Jason Wood\u2019s introduction to a Senate investigation, which found in February that organised crime and illegitimate labour hire companies were taking advantage of \u201cloopholes\u201d in immigration laws to exploit workers who were in Australia waiting for their claims to be processed \u2013 mostly Malaysians on electronic travel authorities. \u201cOrganised crime and illegitimate labour hire companies are using this loophole to bring out illegal workers who are often vulnerable and open to exploitation. This represents an orchestrated scam that enables these criminal elements to exploit foreign workers in Australia until their claims are finalised.\u201d Pezzullo downplayed the findings. \u201cWe do see opportunistic attempts to \u2026 claim asylum after border arrival \u2026 [but] we do not see the scale of organised trafficking that leads to slavery, slavery-like conditions and labour exploitation, on the scale that is present in the media commentary,\u201d he told estimates. \u201cDo we see opportunistic attempts to depress wages and hold people in apprehension about their visa occasions? Yes, on occasion. \u201cDo we see the global human trafficking that sees Australia as a light touch that can easily penetrate all the border defences I described earlier? No we don\u2019t.\u201d",

Trump \u2018surprised\u2019 by backlash to G7 summit plans The acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, appeared on Fox News on Sunday, fronting the administration\u2019s efforts to contain the fallout from a politically perilous week. Mulvaney rowed back his own comments from last week, when he appeared to admit a quid pro quo in the president\u2019s dealings with Ukraine. He also said Donald Trump had been \u201csurprised at the level of pushback\u201d to his announcement that next year\u2019s G7 summit would be held at his own Miami golf resort \u2013 a decision he reversed amid bipartisan criticism. Clinton trolls Trump. Hillary Clinton on Sunday tweeted a mocked-up letter from John F Kennedy to Nikita Khrushchev that parodied Trump\u2019s real \u2013 and already infamous \u2013 missive to the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. Republican critics. The Florida GOP congressman Francis Rooney has said he may vote for Trump\u2019s impeachment. Justin Amash, the Michigan congressman who quit the GOP in July, has refused to rule out running against Trump for president. Bloomberg \u2018still looking at\u2019 presidential run if Biden drops out Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York, has told friends and associates he is \u201cstill looking at\u201d the possibility of a 2020 presidential run. The 77-year-old centrist, who has repeatedly criticised Elizabeth Warren\u2019s anti-corporate policy platform, has reportedly said he may consider a tilt at the Democratic nomination if Warren\u2019s fellow frontrunner Joe Biden were to drop out. Bloomberg apparently fears the progressive Massachusetts senator would be too far left to defeat Trump. Third time lucky? Bloomberg also flirted with the idea of running as an independent in 2012 and 2016, but concluded both times that he would split the Democratic vote and help the Republican to win office. Opioid makers to go on trial in Ohio after settlement talks fail The drug industry is set to go on trial over the opioids crisis in Cleveland, Ohio on Monday, as a jury hears claims by thousands of US communities that drug manufacturers, distributors and pharmacies conspired to fuel the deadly epidemic. Last-minute talks to forestall the trial, which concerns lawsuits brought by two Ohio counties, failed amid a dispute over whether the offered settlement of $50bn was sufficient to meet the costs of the crisis. The companies in the dock have all denied responsibility. Costly crisis. The opioids epidemic has cost the US more than $800bn in the last four years alone, according to a new study of its overall economic impact by the Society of Actuaries. Meghan: \u2018I was warned UK tabloids would destroy my life\u2019 The Duchess of Sussex has said she was warned before marrying Prince Harry that the British tabloid press would \u201cdestroy\u201d her life, in an interview for a TV documentary. \u201cWhen I first met my now husband, my friends were really happy because I was so happy. But my British friends said to me: \u2018I\u2019m sure he\u2019s great. But you shouldn\u2019t do it because the British tabloids will destroy your life,\u2019\u201d she said in the film, which was broadcast in the UK on Sunday. Legal action. The interview was filmed on the couple\u2019s tour of southern Africa, during which it was announced the duchess was suing the Mail on Sunday newspaper, over claims it unlawfully published a private letter she sent to her estranged father. Harry and Wills. The interviewer, Tom Bradby, is a longtime friend of the princes. Harry addressed rumours of a rift between himself and his brother, William, saying they were \u201con different paths at the moment\u201d. Cheat sheet At least eight people are reported to have died in Chile amid a wave of protests and violence, prompted by a recent hike in subway fares that the country\u2019s president, Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era, reversed at the weekend in the hope of ending the unrest. Cheap solar, wind and hydropower projects are proliferating at such a rate that the International Energy Agency now says global supplies of renewable electricity could expand by 50% in the next five years. The former governor of the Bank of England Mervyn King has warned in a speech in Washington that the world is \u201csleepwalking\u201d into another financial crisis, which \u201cwould be devastating to the legitimacy of a democratic market system\u201d. Neuroscientists may have crossed an \u201cethical rubicon\u201d by growing potentially sentient human \u201cmini-brains\u201d in the lab to investigate schizophrenia, autism and other disorders, researchers have said. Must-reads Environmental injustice and our unequal Earth To introduce the Guardian\u2019s new series, Our Unequal Earth, five luminaries explain the pressing issue of \u201cenvironmental justice\u201d, while Nina Lakhani reports on the Colorado River, which serves more than 35 million Americans before reaching the Mexican border, where it is dammed \u2013 leaving those on the other side with a dry delta. Has Netflix fixed its controversial \u2018fat-shaming\u2019 show? The second season of the critically reviled beauty pageant comedy Insatiable has landed on Netflix, and it appears to be addressing its past mistakes in earnest fashion, writes Arielle Bernstein. But has it just slapped a Band-Aid over the problems of an \u201coverwhelmingly crass\u201d first season? Teachers for Bernie, CEOs for Buttigieg: who\u2019s backing whom The Guardian has analysed fundraising reports from the 2020 presidential candidates to find out who is winning over which professions. It turns out teachers love Bernie Sanders, executives are excited by Pete Buttigieg and lawyers opt for Joe Biden, but retirees back Donald Trump.

And, contrary to many media reports of the recent rally, Trump has tried exactly the same gambit before. In the final days before the 2016 election, he <a href=\"https://www.twincities.com/2016/11/06/trump-arrives-in-minnesota-thousands-of-supporters-rally/\">declared</a> to an adoring mob in a hangar at Minneapolis\u2019s airport that the resettlement of Somali refugees was \u201ca disaster taking place\u201d.</p> <p>Like any demagogue, Trump understands how to play on fears, in this case fears catalyzed by the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/04/us/somali-americans-verdict-minneapolis-isis.html\">arrest</a> of several young Somali men in Minneapolis for trying to join Islamic terrorist groups abroad and the <a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/police-new-information-being-released-about-st-cloud-mall-stabbings/396168391/\">stabbing attack</a> by a Somali in a shopping mall in the small city of St Cloud.</p> <p>Trump also knew how to pointedly ignore the larger, normative story of Somalis in Minnesota. This supposedly alien implant actually came to the state through the principled efforts of Lutheran and Catholic resettlement agencies, which earlier had sponsored thousands of Vietnamese and Hmong refugees.</p> <p>Somalis work in a variety of jobs \u2013 cashiers, skycaps, cab drivers \u2013 at the very airport where Trump whipped up rage against them. They have been successful entrepreneurs and enthusiastic founders of charter schools; they are socially conservative. Had the GOP not adopted nativism, racism, and Islamophobia as core precepts, the party might well have wanted to appeal to voters just like the Minnesota Somalis.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s hateful campaign pitch in 2016 nearly worked. He lost Minnesota to Hillary Clinton by merely 1.5%. So it is entirely plausible \u2013 scarily so \u2013 that the demonization of Somalis can carry the state for Trump in 2020. In a closely divided race, the state\u2019s 10 electoral votes loom large.</p> <p>Facing that prospect, Minnesota\u2019s moderates, liberals, and progressives might want to make use of a historical precedent. Trump, as it turns out, is not the first merchant of intolerance to peddle his wares in the state, and not the first one to try to confront and belittle a young, inexperienced mayor, as Jacob Frey is in Minneapolis.</p> <p>More than 70 years ago, the minister, presidential candidate, and wide-ranging bigot Gerald LK Smith made repeated trips to Minneapolis on behalf of his America First political party and Christian nationalist crusade. His foil during those incursions was Hubert Humphrey, initially as an aspiring politician and after 1945 as a mayor in his mid-30s who had never held elective office before.</p> <p>The political geography of Minnesota back then was both totally different and fundamentally the same. It was different in the sense that today\u2019s progressive Minneapolis was considered the most antisemitic city in the country \u2013 while the mining area of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Range\">Iron Range</a> that is Trump country today was fertile ground for radical leftists. It is the same in the sense that an overwhelmingly white, Protestant population is prime to be turned against a racial, religious other.</p> <p>When Smith came to town, that other consisted of Minneapolis\u2019s small communities of Jews and African Americans, who huddled together in adjacent neighborhoods on the city\u2019s North Side. They were penned in there by a pervasive system of restrictive covenants, and subject to rampant job discrimination. A Jew could not even join the city automobile club, and when a black first world war veteran bought a home in a white neighborhood in South Minneapolis, thousands of threatening locals besieged the house.</p> <p>Humphrey fought back in both rhetorical and practical ways. In a public hearing on Smith\u2019s request to speak at the municipal auditorium, Humphrey tore away Smith\u2019s religious mantle, saying that no true Christian could be antisemitic because Jesus was a Jew. After a later Smith speech drew vigorous protests and nearly broke into violence, Humphrey opened his mayoral meeting room to welcome the dissidents.</p> <p>Most of all, Humphrey forced the city to look at its heritage of discrimination unflinchingly through an extensive self-survey led by an African American sociologist. Humphrey pushed through one of the first fair-employment laws in the country. He fought his own police force, which was known for brutality and harassment against minority groups.</p> <p>Such efforts launched Humphrey\u2019s national political career and directly led to his successful drive in 1948 to have the Democratic party platform endorse civil rights for the first time. But it is also true that Humphrey catapulted into Washington so quickly with his Senate election in 1948 that he never finished the work of civil rights and human rights on his home turf.</p> <p>The contemporary political figures who consider themselves in various ways to be Humphrey\u2019s heirs \u2013 Mayor Frey, Governor Tim Walz, Senators Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith \u2013 have been given a golden opportunity by Trump to renew and update Humphrey\u2019s efforts. Those 10 electoral votes may represent an immediate prize, but the greater and broader triumph would be making Minnesota once more a firewall against the forces of hate.</p> <ul> <li><p>Samuel G Freedman, a regular contributor to the Guardian, is a journalism professor at Columbia University and the author of eight books. His ninth will be about Hubert Humphrey and civil rights</p></li> </ul>",

In the final days before the 2016 election, he declared to an adoring mob in a hangar at Minneapolis\u2019s airport that the resettlement of Somali refugees was \u201ca disaster taking place\u201d. Like any demagogue, Trump understands how to play on fears, in this case fears catalyzed by the arrest of several young Somali men in Minneapolis for trying to join Islamic terrorist groups abroad and the stabbing attack by a Somali in a shopping mall in the small city of St Cloud. Trump also knew how to pointedly ignore the larger, normative story of Somalis in Minnesota. This supposedly alien implant actually came to the state through the principled efforts of Lutheran and Catholic resettlement agencies, which earlier had sponsored thousands of Vietnamese and Hmong refugees. Somalis work in a variety of jobs \u2013 cashiers, skycaps, cab drivers \u2013 at the very airport where Trump whipped up rage against them. They have been successful entrepreneurs and enthusiastic founders of charter schools; they are socially conservative. Had the GOP not adopted nativism, racism, and Islamophobia as core precepts, the party might well have wanted to appeal to voters just like the Minnesota Somalis. Trump\u2019s hateful campaign pitch in 2016 nearly worked. He lost Minnesota to Hillary Clinton by merely 1.5%. So it is entirely plausible \u2013 scarily so \u2013 that the demonization of Somalis can carry the state for Trump in 2020. In a closely divided race, the state\u2019s 10 electoral votes loom large. Facing that prospect, Minnesota\u2019s moderates, liberals, and progressives might want to make use of a historical precedent. Trump, as it turns out, is not the first merchant of intolerance to peddle his wares in the state, and not the first one to try to confront and belittle a young, inexperienced mayor, as Jacob Frey is in Minneapolis. More than 70 years ago, the minister, presidential candidate, and wide-ranging bigot Gerald LK Smith made repeated trips to Minneapolis on behalf of his America First political party and Christian nationalist crusade. His foil during those incursions was Hubert Humphrey, initially as an aspiring politician and after 1945 as a mayor in his mid-30s who had never held elective office before. The political geography of Minnesota back then was both totally different and fundamentally the same. It was different in the sense that today\u2019s progressive Minneapolis was considered the most antisemitic city in the country \u2013 while the mining area of the Iron Range that is Trump country today was fertile ground for radical leftists. It is the same in the sense that an overwhelmingly white, Protestant population is prime to be turned against a racial, religious other. When Smith came to town, that other consisted of Minneapolis\u2019s small communities of Jews and African Americans, who huddled together in adjacent neighborhoods on the city\u2019s North Side. They were penned in there by a pervasive system of restrictive covenants, and subject to rampant job discrimination. A Jew could not even join the city automobile club, and when a black first world war veteran bought a home in a white neighborhood in South Minneapolis, thousands of threatening locals besieged the house. Humphrey fought back in both rhetorical and practical ways. In a public hearing on Smith\u2019s request to speak at the municipal auditorium, Humphrey tore away Smith\u2019s religious mantle, saying that no true Christian could be antisemitic because Jesus was a Jew. After a later Smith speech drew vigorous protests and nearly broke into violence, Humphrey opened his mayoral meeting room to welcome the dissidents. Most of all, Humphrey forced the city to look at its heritage of discrimination unflinchingly through an extensive self-survey led by an African American sociologist. Humphrey pushed through one of the first fair-employment laws in the country. He fought his own police force, which was known for brutality and harassment against minority groups. Such efforts launched Humphrey\u2019s national political career and directly led to his successful drive in 1948 to have the Democratic party platform endorse civil rights for the first time. But it is also true that Humphrey catapulted into Washington so quickly with his Senate election in 1948 that he never finished the work of civil rights and human rights on his home turf. The contemporary political figures who consider themselves in various ways to be Humphrey\u2019s heirs \u2013 Mayor Frey, Governor Tim Walz, Senators Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith \u2013 have been given a golden opportunity by Trump to renew and update Humphrey\u2019s efforts. Those 10 electoral votes may represent an immediate prize, but the greater and broader triumph would be making Minnesota once more a firewall against the forces of hate.

The loss of the river in Mexico has been devastating.</p> <p>Nancy Salda\u00f1a, 54, an architect and activist in the Sonoran town of San Luis R\u00edo Colorado, recalls boat rides and fishing with her family during the 1980s, when the US occasionally released \u201cextra\u201d water to deal with heavy snow and rain that risked overwhelming its dams. Her mother, an evangelical pastor, conducted baptisms in the river until it disappeared.</p> <p>\u201cTaking away the river had a huge impact on us, it took away part of our identity. I felt anger, sadness and grief. My children had never seen the river flow.\u201d</p> <p>The disparities on both sides of the border are stark.</p> <p>In the US, the Colorado serves more than 35 million people, including several native tribes, seven national wildlife refuges and 11 national parks, and supports $26m tourism and recreational industries, as well as farming. California has rights to the largest quantity, with 4.4m acre-feet per year \u2013 or 29% of the total \u2013 while Utah is allocated 1.7m and Nevada 0.3m<strong>.</strong></p> <p>At the Morelos dam, located between Los Algodones, Baja California, and Yuma, Arizona, the river is diverted to a complex system of irrigation canals which nourish fields of cotton, wheat, alfalfa, asparagus, watermelons and date palms in the vast surrounding desert valley. This is good for farmers \u2013 and less so for ordinary Mexicans.</p> <p>Following the dry riverbed south towards the Gulf of California evokes an eerie sadness. The sound of gunfire in one wide, dusty section led to a couple from San Diego hunting wild pigeons, and a bucketful of feathered corpses. A few miles west along dirt farm roads, dozens of herons, egrets and ducks were staking out a wonderfully lush wetland \u2013 though it is only an accidental byproduct<strong> </strong>created by agricultural runoff from surrounding wheat and alfalfa fields.</p> <h2>Prolonged drought and global heating</h2> <p>The Colorado basin is one of 276 watersheds that cross international borders and Mexican supporters of the binational treaty argue that it resolved longstanding diplomatic disputes and enabled the region\u2019s economic development, even if there is mostly no longer a river in the channel.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re the only place in Mexico with a secure water supply, that is a privilege,\u201d said Francisco Bernal, the International Boundary and Water Commission (Cila) representative in Mexicali.</p> <p>But the treaty didn\u2019t foresee prolonged drought, global heating and mounting demands. Now, water is running out, and things must change.</p> <p>The population of Baja California grew from 1.67 million in 1990 to 3.5 million in 2018. Most of the river water still goes to farmers. Groundwater reserves are dwindling, pollution goes unchecked, and urban neighborhoods face shortages.</p> <p>\u201cIf agriculture was forced to be more efficient there would be enough for everyone else,\u201d said Dr Jorge Ram\u00edrez, a leading water scientist at the Autonomous University of Baja California. \u201cWe have enough water, what we lack is planning. Water is <em>the </em>currency here and politics always wins.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--immersive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Fd15095ef94f5f371b9c62a3a4bccf8274ed2b952%3Fcrop%3D0_220_3778_2267&amp;left-caption=Fishing%20boats%20in%20the%20yard%20of%20a%20home%20in%20El%20Indiviso%2C%20a%20Cucapa%20community%20in%20Baja%20California%2C%20Mexico.%20Meghan%20Dhaliwal%20for%20The%20Guardian&amp;right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F5c2271d7dab80e64fc8037cf4947ac69537a8235%3Fcrop%3D250_0_3630_2179&amp;right-caption=A%20parched%20section%20of%20the%20Colorado%20River%20in%20northern%20Mexico%2C%20near%20the%20US%20border.%20Meghan%20Dhaliwal%20for%20The%20Guardian&amp;always-place-captions-below=false\" data-alt=\"Dry Colorado river\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Fd15095ef94f5f371b9c62a3a4bccf8274ed2b952%3Fcrop%3D0_220_3778_2267&left-caption=Fishing%20boats%20in%20the%20yard%20of%20a%20home%20in%20El%20Indiviso%2C%20a%20Cucapa%20community%20in%20Baja%20California%2C%20Mexico.%20Meghan%20Dhaliwal%20for%20The%20Guardian&right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F5c2271d7dab80e64fc8037cf4947ac69537a8235%3Fcrop%3D250_0_3630_2179&right-caption=A%20parched%20section%20of%20the%20Colorado%20River%20in%20northern%20Mexico%2C%20near%20the%20US%20border.%20Meghan%20Dhaliwal%20for%20The%20Guardian&always-place-captions-below=false\">Dry Colorado river</a> </figure>  <p>In recent years, protests have erupted in response to allegations of corruption and poorly policed pollution standards that favor big landowners and water guzzling industries, such as a <a href=\"https://www.animalpolitico.com/2019/04/lucha-agua-ciudadanos-gobierno-cervecera-baja-california/\">controversial</a> US brewery under construction in the Mexicali valley. </p> <p>In 2020, both countries will for the first time implement rationing.

      "bodyText": "The temperature is rising toward 45C (113F) as young brothers Daniel and Dilan Rodr\u00edguez skip towards a bridge over the Colorado River in the Mexican border town of San Luis R\u00edo Colorado. But there is no water flowing through the channel of one of the world\u2019s mightiest waterways. The pair run down the river bank and cheerfully splash through stagnant puddles dotted about the riverbed. \u201cWe wish we had a river, so we could swim, and jump and sail my cousin\u2019s boat,\u201d said Daniel, 12. \u201cAt least we have puddles to make mud balls, that can be fun.\u201d The Colorado originates in the Rocky mountains and traverses seven US states, watering cities and farmland, before reaching Mexico, where it is supposed to flow onwards to the Sea of Cortez. Instead, the river is dammed at the US-Mexico border, and on the other side the river channel is empty. Locals are now battling to bring it back to life. There are few more striking examples of what has come to be known as \u201cenvironmental injustice\u201d \u2013 the inequitable access to clean land, air and water, and disproportionate exposure to hazards and climate disasters. Water in particular has emerged as a flash point as global heating renders vast swaths of the planet ever drier. Today the Guardian is launching a year-long series, Our Unequal Earth, to investigate environmental inequalities and discrimination in the US and beyond. It will also reveal how the climate crisis is making things worse for activists and scientists on the ground. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard stories from my mum about how she used to play and swim in the Colorado River when she was little, but we\u2019ve never experienced it,\u201d said Evelin Bautista, 14, who is a member of an indigenous tribe, the Cucap\u00e1, which means the River People. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that over the border, the water is so clear that they can even see the fish.\u201d Indeed, a mere 30 miles north, over the border at Gateway park in Yuma, Arizona, siblings Damien Navarro, 12, and Dariana, eight, spent the day fishing, diving and swimming in the free flowing river. \u201cIt\u2019s so hot, we come here all the time, the kids love the water, and we often catch catfish, bass and bluegill,\u201d said their father, David Barraga. \u201cI didn\u2019t know there\u2019s no river in Mexico. Wow, that\u2019s a shame.\u201d \u201cAt school in science we\u2019ve been learning about drought, that the planet is getting hotter,\u201d said his son, Damien. \u201cBut we\u2019ve never been told about the dam or the river in Mexico, maybe when we\u2019re older. It\u2019s really too bad for those kids.\u201d \u2018It took away part of our identity\u2019 Because the 1944 treaty did not allocate Mexico any water for the river itself, the channel is mostly dry. The loss of the river in Mexico has been devastating. Nancy Salda\u00f1a, 54, an architect and activist in the Sonoran town of San Luis R\u00edo Colorado, recalls boat rides and fishing with her family during the 1980s, when the US occasionally released \u201cextra\u201d water to deal with heavy snow and rain that risked overwhelming its dams. Her mother, an evangelical pastor, conducted baptisms in the river until it disappeared. \u201cTaking away the river had a huge impact on us, it took away part of our identity. I felt anger, sadness and grief. My children had never seen the river flow.\u201d The disparities on both sides of the border are stark. In the US, the Colorado serves more than 35 million people, including several native tribes, seven national wildlife refuges and 11 national parks, and supports $26m tourism and recreational industries, as well as farming. California has rights to the largest quantity, with 4.4m acre-feet per year \u2013 or 29% of the total \u2013 while Utah is allocated 1.7m and Nevada 0.3m. At the Morelos dam, located between Los Algodones, Baja California, and Yuma, Arizona, the river is diverted to a complex system of irrigation canals which nourish fields of cotton, wheat, alfalfa, asparagus, watermelons and date palms in the vast surrounding desert valley. This is good for farmers \u2013 and less so for ordinary Mexicans. Following the dry riverbed south towards the Gulf of California evokes an eerie sadness. The sound of gunfire in one wide, dusty section led to a couple from San Diego hunting wild pigeons, and a bucketful of feathered corpses. A few miles west along dirt farm roads, dozens of herons, egrets and ducks were staking out a wonderfully lush wetland \u2013 though it is only an accidental byproduct created by agricultural runoff from surrounding wheat and alfalfa fields. Prolonged drought and global heating The Colorado basin is one of 276 watersheds that cross international borders and Mexican supporters of the binational treaty argue that it resolved longstanding diplomatic disputes and enabled the region\u2019s economic development, even if there is mostly no longer a river in the channel. \u201cWe\u2019re the only place in Mexico with a secure water supply, that is a privilege,\u201d said Francisco Bernal, the International Boundary and Water Commission (Cila) representative in Mexicali. But the treaty didn\u2019t foresee prolonged drought, global heating and mounting demands. Now, water is running out, and things must change. The population of Baja California grew from 1.67 million in 1990 to 3.5 million in 2018. Most of the river water still goes to farmers. Groundwater reserves are dwindling, pollution goes unchecked, and urban neighborhoods face shortages. \u201cIf agriculture was forced to be more efficient there would be enough for everyone else,\u201d said Dr Jorge Ram\u00edrez, a leading water scientist at the Autonomous University of Baja California. \u201cWe have enough water, what we lack is planning. Water is the currency here and politics always wins.\u201d In recent years, protests have erupted in response to allegations of corruption and poorly policed pollution standards that favor big landowners and water guzzling industries, such as a controversial US brewery under construction in the Mexicali valley. In 2020, both countries will for the first time implement rationing. Mexico must cut usage by 3%. The US must save 247m cubic metres. The plan would have been much stricter if not for record snowfall in parts of the Colorado basin last year. The reductions can only be accomplished if farmers waste less and participate in reforestation efforts. Even so, scientists are optimistic that the delta can partially recover. \u2018The Gabachos [Americans] should leave some water for us\u2019 In the scorched and barren delta, visitors may encounter an incongruous sight: 700 acres of flourishing native trees and shrubs in three reforestation sites. They are the product of what is called a \u201cpulse flow\u201d. In 2014, an environmental experiment driven by not-for-profits on both sides of the border resulted in 105,392 acres-feet (130m cubic metres) of extra water being released into Mexico over two months, simulating the natural spring floods of yesteryear. The pulse flow bolstered parched wetlands and reforestation zones where native cottonwood and willow trees naturally germinated. And for a few days, for the first time in years, the river reconnected to the Sea of Cortez: fish stocks increased, dolphins returned and the number of migratory birds rocketed by 43%. But for some scientists, the community response was perhaps the most surprising and satisfying. Thousands flocked to the river as it returned, briefly, to its former glory. \u201cI grew up with my mum\u2019s stories about the river in the old days, but couldn\u2019t believe it until I saw it myself,\u201d said Ulises Monroy Salda\u00f1a, 13. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget putting my hand in the water for the first time: it was cold, but it felt so nice because it was so hot here.\u201d Daniel Rodr\u00edguez was just seven years old, but still remembers the excitement of watching the river fill with water. \u201cWe\u2019d come every day after school and keep jumping off the bridge until the police chased us away.\u201d His grandmother, Lupe Aderete, 53, set up portable toilets for the massive influx of visitors. \u201cIt was beautiful to see the river alive again, everyone was so happy, and I made some extra money.\u201d She added: \u201cIt\u2019s not fair, the Gabachos [Americans] should leave some water for us. The restoration site at Laguna Grande is a shady oasis of gangly cottonwood and willow trees surrounded by desert and farmland, visited by over 2,000 people last year. \u201cFor most children, it\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve seen a forest, and for the adults it brings back memories. Connecting to nature is emotional, and visitors cry all the time,\u201d said Gabriela Gonz\u00e1lez, education coordinator at the Sonora Institute which runs Laguna Grande.

At home in Miguel Alem\u00e1n, a poor makeshift neighbourhood with little shade, the Rodr\u00edguez brothers ditch their school stuff, grab a plastic bucket and rush back across the parched terrain to the concrete drainage canal running parallel to the littered riverbed. They fearlessly dive into the polluted waterway, which emerges under the metal border wall, to cool down and catch some fish for dinner.

Perhaps this was the performance that will remind United what they can be. Perhaps (and this may be more important to United fans in the short term) this will sow doubts at Liverpool and interrupt their title challenge.</p> <p>The sense was that Adam Lallana\u2019s late equaliser changed everything. That it will persuade Liverpool they can still pull out results when everything is going against them and that it will confirm to United \u2013 board, fans and players \u2013 that stagnation is now their state.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/20/glazers-manchester-united-ed-woodward-football\">Glazers have no plans to sell Manchester United, says Ed Woodward</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even the identity of the goalscorer seemed to be making a point: Lallana, a player blighted by injury, scoring his first goal since May 2017. Sometime the fates really have it in for you: Mohamed Salah is injured; you have blunted Sadio Man\u00e9; you have kept Roberto Firmino quiet; you have seen off Divock Origi; and you end up being the patsy to a heartwarming comeback story. In the 90s it was United who played with the force of fairytale story behind them.</p> <p>Solskj\u00e6r got much right. The switch to a back three allowed the wing-backs, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Ashley Young to push higher and engage Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson early. The Liverpool pair contributed 23 assists between them last season and had added a further two each this. But at Old Trafford they ended up hitting a string of crosses from deeper positions from where they are easier to defend, particularly when you have three central defenders waiting. The result was the cross accuracy of Liverpool\u2019s full-backs was 17.6%, having been at 27.6% over the first eight games of the season.</p> <p>But the leveller, of course, for this really was not Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s day, stemmed from a mis-hit cross from Robertson on the left, on one of the few occasions he had got into a dangerous position high on that flank.</p> <p>The back three also allowed Solskj\u00e6r to sit two holding midfielders deep, in just the area where Firmino likes to drop. At the same time, that trapezium of five defensive players packed into a central block \u2013 the same structure that was so effective for Antonio Conte\u2019s Chelsea \u2013 was hard for Liverpool\u2019s midfield to penetrate, one of the reasons why their passing was so wayward. Again and again they seemed to choose the wrong option, at least in part because the usual option was not available.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1fc7084682aacc9162401404bb4eb3beca028e89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1fc7084682aacc9162401404bb4eb3beca028e89/0_71_2111_1267/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marcus Rashford gives Manchester United the lead against Liverpool and the England man looked back to his best on Sunday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marcus Rashford gives Manchester United the lead against Liverpool and the England man looked back to his best on Sunday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Super/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the front three, Solskj\u00e6r then turned to the disposition he had successfully employed at Tottenham last season with the two centre-forwards split and Andreas Pereira operating as Jesse Lingard had then as a false nine.</p> <p>That Marcus Rashford and Daniel James are both used to operating wide helped and Liverpool struggled to cope as the space behind those attacking full-backs was targeted. If they went forward as usual, there was a major risk of the two central defenders becoming stretched.

      "bodyText": "So close. So, so close. Manchester United came within five minutes of pulling off their best result since Paris in March. Had they done so, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r would have been hailed for his tactical genius, for the boldness of the changes that forced Liverpool into their worst performance of the season, for the vision that found a plan from the most unpromising pieces. But results are the great validifiers, and the 1-1 draw leaves United two points above the teams in the relegation zone. As Solskj\u00e6r observed last week, in what must have been for him a moment of devastating self-realisation, it\u2019s not the 1990s any more. Perhaps this will prove a springboard. Perhaps this was the performance that will remind United what they can be. Perhaps (and this may be more important to United fans in the short term) this will sow doubts at Liverpool and interrupt their title challenge. The sense was that Adam Lallana\u2019s late equaliser changed everything. That it will persuade Liverpool they can still pull out results when everything is going against them and that it will confirm to United \u2013 board, fans and players \u2013 that stagnation is now their state. Even the identity of the goalscorer seemed to be making a point: Lallana, a player blighted by injury, scoring his first goal since May 2017. Sometime the fates really have it in for you: Mohamed Salah is injured; you have blunted Sadio Man\u00e9; you have kept Roberto Firmino quiet; you have seen off Divock Origi; and you end up being the patsy to a heartwarming comeback story. In the 90s it was United who played with the force of fairytale story behind them. Solskj\u00e6r got much right. The switch to a back three allowed the wing-backs, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Ashley Young to push higher and engage Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson early. The Liverpool pair contributed 23 assists between them last season and had added a further two each this. But at Old Trafford they ended up hitting a string of crosses from deeper positions from where they are easier to defend, particularly when you have three central defenders waiting. The result was the cross accuracy of Liverpool\u2019s full-backs was 17.6%, having been at 27.6% over the first eight games of the season. But the leveller, of course, for this really was not Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s day, stemmed from a mis-hit cross from Robertson on the left, on one of the few occasions he had got into a dangerous position high on that flank. The back three also allowed Solskj\u00e6r to sit two holding midfielders deep, in just the area where Firmino likes to drop. At the same time, that trapezium of five defensive players packed into a central block \u2013 the same structure that was so effective for Antonio Conte\u2019s Chelsea \u2013 was hard for Liverpool\u2019s midfield to penetrate, one of the reasons why their passing was so wayward. Again and again they seemed to choose the wrong option, at least in part because the usual option was not available. For the front three, Solskj\u00e6r then turned to the disposition he had successfully employed at Tottenham last season with the two centre-forwards split and Andreas Pereira operating as Jesse Lingard had then as a false nine. That Marcus Rashford and Daniel James are both used to operating wide helped and Liverpool struggled to cope as the space behind those attacking full-backs was targeted. If they went forward as usual, there was a major risk of the two central defenders becoming stretched. That in turn placed huge pressure on Fabinho to sit deep and cover Pereira as he sought to exploit any gap that might appear between Virgil van Dijk and Jo\u00ebl Matip. On a handful of occasions in the first half he nearly did; overall Pereira had an excellent game but had his final ball been better on a couple of key occasions United might have been further ahead by the break. J\u00fcrgen Klopp countered first with a switch to 4-2-3-1 and then 4-4-2, which meant Gini Wijnaldum dropping deeper to support Fabinho, and additional players wide to try to take the game to United\u2019s wing-backs. The balance of the game tipped Liverpool\u2019s way, without them creating a hatful of chances, to which Solskj\u00e6r responded by dropping Pereira deeper and trying to overman in central midfield. Doing so, though, pulled the two centre-forwards narrower, liberating the full-backs, which in the end, however fortuitously given Robertson scuffed his cross, brought the equaliser. Solskj\u00e6r, for all his innovation, was undone by the fact that, fundamentally, Liverpool have better players. It has perhaps been forgotten that in the early part of his reign, the win over Tottenham at Wembley and in Paris especially, he seemed to be living up to Alex Ferguson\u2019s glowing assessment of his tactical abilities. Whether he has the drive, the charisma and the organisational capacity to oversee the rebuilding of United is another matter. Perhaps the most telling detail was that, even if United had held on to win, they would have done so with the second lowest possession figure they have recorded at Old Trafford. It really isn\u2019t the 90s any more.",

      "body": "<h2>What\u2019s the point of daylight saving time?</h2> <p>In short, to make better use of the light. When we move clocks backward an hour in the autumn, we are effectively transferring an hour of daylight from evening to morning, when it is arguably more useful to more people. The opposite thing happens in the spring.</p> <p>Daylight saving time is specifically the period between spring and autumn when we get an extra hour of daylight in the evening. Smarter readers will have noticed that no daylight is actually saved.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aa9a8fca4705027a93d6faab8220b63ab451cd6b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa9a8fca4705027a93d6faab8220b63ab451cd6b/0_0_1024_1024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sundial on the Wedding Tower on the Darmstadt Mathildenh\u00f6he.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sundial on the Wedding Tower on the Darmstadt Mathildenh\u00f6he.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: hogsvilleBrit/GuardianWitness</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>When did it all start?</h2> <p>The idea of fiddling with time to save energy or make the day seem longer goes back more than 200 years, though it was not until the first world war that it was finally taken seriously.</p> <p>Coal shortages throughout Europe prompted Germany and its ally Austria-Hungary to take up daylight saving in 1916 to preserve energy, and a flurry of other nations on both sides of the conflict quickly followed suit. The UK took the plunge in May 1916 and has stuck with it ever since.</p> <p>Many countries dropped the ruse after 1918, only readopt it during the energy crises of the 1970s.</p> <h2>What is happening this year?</h2> <p>All EU member states move clocks back one hour on Sunday, under a law that harmonises the duration of wintertime to prevent a proliferation of different seasonal changes across neighbouring countries.</p> <p>In the US, clocks go back on the first Sunday in November.</p> <p>In the antipodes, New Zealand moved its clocks forward at the end of September and Australian states that observe daylight saving (New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory) made the switch on the first Sunday in October.</p> <p>Russia decided to stick with daylight saving all year round in 2011, but that led to darkness at noon in some latitudes, and so in 2014 it reverted to standard time in the autumn. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/01/russia-state-duma-daylight-saving-time-summer\">The clocks have stayed </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/01/russia-state-duma-daylight-saving-time-summer\">there ever since</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c30b247369706960af897dbcdf137aed7878bc26\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c30b247369706960af897dbcdf137aed7878bc26/0_926_3500_1437/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clocks inside the control room of an abandoned Soviet-era optical radio telescope, on the slope of Mount Aragats, Armenia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"411\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clocks inside the control room of an abandoned Soviet-era optical radio telescope, on the slope of Mount Aragats, Armenia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anton Vaganov/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>What are the knock-on effects of daylight saving time?</h2> <p>Well at this time of year, an hour extra in bed for a start. But DST has far wider ramifications, for energy use, farming, even mood.</p> <p>Some argue that DST <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w14429\">does not really save energy</a>, as less household usage in the evenings in summer might be offset by greater morning usage.</p> <p>Health impacts are widely touted: people can get more exposure to sunlight through the summer DST months, boosting their vitamin D levels. But critics argue that disruption to circadian rhythms (sleep patterns) can negatively impact on human health. Studies <a href=\"https://openheart.bmj.com/content/1/1/e000019\">have found</a> that the risk of having a heart attack increases in the first three weekdays after switching to DST in the spring.</p> <p>However they also found that the extra hour of sleep after the clocks went back in autumn decreased the risk of heart attacks in the first few weekdays after switching.</p> <p>Studies suggest that although getting an \u201cextra hour of sleep\u201d when the clocks move back does not lead to people sleeping longer, the loss of an hour of sleep when the clocks move forward negatively affects sleeping patterns for several weeks afterwards.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e24238f64c67e080dd6719fb1ef3208db54f497\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e24238f64c67e080dd6719fb1ef3208db54f497/0_91_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The mists of time\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The mists of time</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Siese Veenstra/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Is there an economic effect?</h2> <p>DST is thought to have an impact on the economy but again it is a mixed picture. While the retail and tourism industries do benefit from the extra hour of summer evening daylight, that may well be offset by some of the health effects mentioned above.</p> <p>The farming industry has traditionally disliked DST for its impact on everything from milking cows to reaping harvests. But an NFU spokesman painted a more nuanced picture. \u201cThe last time we tested opinion among our members there was a narrow majority in favour of lighter evenings,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The aviation sector is little affected. Plane schedules have to work around the issue of countries changing clocks at different times. To do so all airplanes and airport timetables run off of UTC which is based off GMT.</p> <h2>Is DST dangerous?</h2> <p>It depends if you\u2019re driving or not.</p> <p>Peak driving times are between 8am and 10am in the morning between 3pm and 7pm in the afternoon.</p> <p>When the clocks move back in autumn, it means that the majority of these peak hours in the afternoon are in darkness. More accidents happen for a whole variety of reasons in the afternoon peak than in the morning peak, and <a href=\"https://www.motoringresearch.com/car-news/british-clock-change-accidents/\">studies have suggested</a> that putting the clocks back in the autumn might increase accident numbers.</p> <p>For this reason, Rospa (the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents) proposed that Britain retain daylight saving all year round, arguing that darker mornings were marginally more preferable to darker evenings.</p> <p>While we\u2019re talking about danger, there also appears to be an impact on crime, with <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brookings-now/2015/10/29/fighting-crime-with-daylight-saving-time/\">the lighter spring evenings less appealing to hoodlums</a>.</p> <h2>Is it popular?</h2> <p>A YouGov survey suggest that a slim majority of people are in favour of keeping daylight saving time, with 44% saying that they would prefer to keep the current system of switching the clocks forward and back twice a year, as against 39% who would like to scrap it.</p> <p>The survey shows interesting regional differences. Scotland heavily favours the status quo, as switching to DST all year round would result in sunrise after 10am in some parts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d48ff16f20aadad7570719fb9961569ebfe601d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d48ff16f20aadad7570719fb9961569ebfe601d/0_252_4416_2649/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Morning prayer to celebrate Eid al-Fitr, marking the end of Ramadan in Gaza City.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Morning prayer to celebrate Eid al-Fitr, marking the end of Ramadan in Gaza City.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mohammed Abed/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Which countries don\u2019t bother with DST?</h2> <p>About 70 countries observe daylight saving time. Most countries around the equator do not, as there is little variation in daylight across the year.</p> <p>Most Islamic countries do not use daylight saving time as during Ramadan it can mean that the evening dinner is delayed till later in the day. Morocco suspends DST during the fast. Iran utilises DST, with no discontinuation for Ramadan. Most of east Asia and Africa does not use daylight saving time.</p> <p>This year the European parliament voted to scrap daylight saving time by 2021. If ratified, it could throw up yet another Brexit-related headache.</p> <h2>There can\u2019t be a Brexit angle to this surely?</h2> <p>It\u2019s 2019 \u2013 there\u2019s a Brexit angle to everything.</p> <p>If the UK leaves the EU before 2021 and the bloc goes ahead with its plan to scrap DST, a situation could arise in which for half the year Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would be in different time zones. Forget hard border, soft border and customs border: this would be a \u201ctime\u201d border.</p> <p>On the upside, it might allow for grabbing a quick sandwich to eat in, say, Derry before popping across the border to Donegal and having lunch again.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a4150969c2436b7f459f23f756e995eced9d0cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a4150969c2436b7f459f23f756e995eced9d0cd/0_480_2912_1747/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Shepherd gate clock at the Royal Observatory Greenwich\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Shepherd gate 24-hour clock at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich.

Time is after all a fluid concept?</h2> <p>In our modern age of digital watches, smartphones, rail timetables and synchronised calendars, it may seem that time is fixed and orderly.

      "bodyText": "What\u2019s the point of daylight saving time? In short, to make better use of the light. When we move clocks backward an hour in the autumn, we are effectively transferring an hour of daylight from evening to morning, when it is arguably more useful to more people. The opposite thing happens in the spring. Daylight saving time is specifically the period between spring and autumn when we get an extra hour of daylight in the evening. Smarter readers will have noticed that no daylight is actually saved. When did it all start? The idea of fiddling with time to save energy or make the day seem longer goes back more than 200 years, though it was not until the first world war that it was finally taken seriously. Coal shortages throughout Europe prompted Germany and its ally Austria-Hungary to take up daylight saving in 1916 to preserve energy, and a flurry of other nations on both sides of the conflict quickly followed suit. The UK took the plunge in May 1916 and has stuck with it ever since. Many countries dropped the ruse after 1918, only readopt it during the energy crises of the 1970s. What is happening this year? All EU member states move clocks back one hour on Sunday, under a law that harmonises the duration of wintertime to prevent a proliferation of different seasonal changes across neighbouring countries. In the US, clocks go back on the first Sunday in November. In the antipodes, New Zealand moved its clocks forward at the end of September and Australian states that observe daylight saving (New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory) made the switch on the first Sunday in October. Russia decided to stick with daylight saving all year round in 2011, but that led to darkness at noon in some latitudes, and so in 2014 it reverted to standard time in the autumn. The clocks have stayed there ever since. What are the knock-on effects of daylight saving time? Well at this time of year, an hour extra in bed for a start. But DST has far wider ramifications, for energy use, farming, even mood. Some argue that DST does not really save energy, as less household usage in the evenings in summer might be offset by greater morning usage. Health impacts are widely touted: people can get more exposure to sunlight through the summer DST months, boosting their vitamin D levels. But critics argue that disruption to circadian rhythms (sleep patterns) can negatively impact on human health. Studies have found that the risk of having a heart attack increases in the first three weekdays after switching to DST in the spring. However they also found that the extra hour of sleep after the clocks went back in autumn decreased the risk of heart attacks in the first few weekdays after switching. Studies suggest that although getting an \u201cextra hour of sleep\u201d when the clocks move back does not lead to people sleeping longer, the loss of an hour of sleep when the clocks move forward negatively affects sleeping patterns for several weeks afterwards. Is there an economic effect? DST is thought to have an impact on the economy but again it is a mixed picture. While the retail and tourism industries do benefit from the extra hour of summer evening daylight, that may well be offset by some of the health effects mentioned above. The farming industry has traditionally disliked DST for its impact on everything from milking cows to reaping harvests. But an NFU spokesman painted a more nuanced picture. \u201cThe last time we tested opinion among our members there was a narrow majority in favour of lighter evenings,\u201d he said. The aviation sector is little affected. Plane schedules have to work around the issue of countries changing clocks at different times. To do so all airplanes and airport timetables run off of UTC which is based off GMT. Is DST dangerous? It depends if you\u2019re driving or not. Peak driving times are between 8am and 10am in the morning between 3pm and 7pm in the afternoon. When the clocks move back in autumn, it means that the majority of these peak hours in the afternoon are in darkness. More accidents happen for a whole variety of reasons in the afternoon peak than in the morning peak, and studies have suggested that putting the clocks back in the autumn might increase accident numbers. For this reason, Rospa (the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents) proposed that Britain retain daylight saving all year round, arguing that darker mornings were marginally more preferable to darker evenings. While we\u2019re talking about danger, there also appears to be an impact on crime, with the lighter spring evenings less appealing to hoodlums. Is it popular? A YouGov survey suggest that a slim majority of people are in favour of keeping daylight saving time, with 44% saying that they would prefer to keep the current system of switching the clocks forward and back twice a year, as against 39% who would like to scrap it. The survey shows interesting regional differences. Scotland heavily favours the status quo, as switching to DST all year round would result in sunrise after 10am in some parts. Which countries don\u2019t bother with DST? About 70 countries observe daylight saving time. Most countries around the equator do not, as there is little variation in daylight across the year. Most Islamic countries do not use daylight saving time as during Ramadan it can mean that the evening dinner is delayed till later in the day. Morocco suspends DST during the fast. Iran utilises DST, with no discontinuation for Ramadan. Most of east Asia and Africa does not use daylight saving time. This year the European parliament voted to scrap daylight saving time by 2021. If ratified, it could throw up yet another Brexit-related headache. There can\u2019t be a Brexit angle to this surely? It\u2019s 2019 \u2013 there\u2019s a Brexit angle to everything. If the UK leaves the EU before 2021 and the bloc goes ahead with its plan to scrap DST, a situation could arise in which for half the year Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would be in different time zones. Forget hard border, soft border and customs border: this would be a \u201ctime\u201d border. On the upside, it might allow for grabbing a quick sandwich to eat in, say, Derry before popping across the border to Donegal and having lunch again. Ha! Time is after all a fluid concept? In our modern age of digital watches, smartphones, rail timetables and synchronised calendars, it may seem that time is fixed and orderly. This is not the case. Before the technology developed to reliably tell the time, people structured their time much more loosely. Ancient civilisations divided the daylight into 12 hours no matter how long or short daytime was. This meant daylight hours became longer during the spring and summer and shorter in the autumn and the winter. We know this to be the case in ancient Rome as the Romans kept time using water clocks with different scales for different months. Even as mechanical clocks and timepieces began to be invented, time still varied widely from place to place. In Italy, for example, clocks in Venice always ran a half hour ahead of clocks in Turin. Our understanding of uniform time \u2013 so called \u201cclock time\u201d \u2013 is a very recent concept that dates back to the early development of railways. As railroads spread, the problem of every town and station having its own individual time made coordinating rail travel tricky. Nations began to standardise time because of this. The UK was a pioneer, starting in the 1840s with the Great Western Railway, and by 1883 all UK railways ran on GMT. Other nations followed suit, with the occasional quirk.

International time zones didn\u2019t standardise across the world until the 1930s. Nepal in 1956 was the last country to adopt a standard international time zone pegged to GMT.

I vaguely knew they\u2019d provided the text for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dream_of_Gerontius\">Edward Elgar\u2019s 1900 choral work</a> based on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dream_of_Gerontius_(poem)\">The Dream of Gerontius</a> \u2013 the long work that includes this week\u2019s choice. I\u2019d sung a few of his hymns. But I\u2019d never thought the man of God a serious man of poems.</p> <p>Catching up with at least some of his verse \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.newmanreader.org/works/verses/gerontius.html\">there\u2019s a considerable amount</a> from a long life (1801\u20131890) \u2013 I\u2019ve found him more meditative than didactic. He can even be self-mocking, as in <a href=\"http://www.newmanreader.org/works/verses/verse12.html\">Opusculum</a>, a witty occasional poem, with some innovative line breaks, beginning: \u201cFair Cousin, thy page / Is small to encage / The thoughts which engage / The mind of a sage, / Such as I am \u2026\u201d Here, the august cardinal and saint-to-be is simply an attractive minor Victorian poet, intelligently but comfortably inhabiting the skin of his social class.</p> <p>The Dream of Gerontius is a different matter, an ambitious work whose central dialogue, between a dreamer\u2019s soul and his guardian angel, includes choral sections (for \u201cAngelicals\u201d, Demon and others), litanies and hymns.</p> <p>By now a Catholic convert, Newman had an agenda for the poem \u2013 to examine, post-Dante, the workings of a purgatorial process for the soul during the journey of the afterlife. </p> <p>Interestingly, the poem ends with Gerontius about to be dipped in \u201cpenal waters\u201d by his solicitous Angel, as if Newman couldn\u2019t quite bring his gentle imagination to fully confront that terrible fire which, as the Angel explains elsewhere in the poem, is \u201cfire without its light\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"32b65f2f60ddc34fd230ac7ae51f77a0ba41db76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32b65f2f60ddc34fd230ac7ae51f77a0ba41db76/0_0_1819_2728/667.jpg\" alt=\"A tapestry portraying Cardinal John Henry Newman hangs from St Peter\u2019s Basilica, at the Vatican last Sunday to honour his canonisation.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reporting back? \u2026 A tapestry depicting Cardinal John Henry Newman hangs from St Peter\u2019s Basilica, at the Vatican last Sunday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alessandra Tarantino/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The poem was written in 1865. Newman claimed it happened \u201cby chance\u201d. Perhaps, drafting his thoughts on casual scraps of paper, Newman wanted to \u201cencage\u201d both prayers to his God and conversations with himself.

      "bodyText": "The Soul of Gerontius I went to sleep; and now I am refresh\u2019d, A strange refreshment: for I feel in me An inexpressive lightness, and a sense Of freedom, as I were at length myself, And ne\u2019er had been before. How still it is! I hear no more the busy beat of time, No, nor my fluttering breath, nor struggling pulse; Nor does one moment differ from the next. I had a dream; yes \u2013 some one softly said \u201cHe\u2019s gone\u201d; and then a sigh went round the room. And then I surely heard a priestly voice Cry \u201cSubvenite\u201d; and they knelt in prayer. I seem to hear him still; but thin and low, And fainter and more faint the accents come, As at an ever-widening interval. Ah! whence is this? What is this severance? This silence pours a solitariness Into the very essence of my soul; And the deep rest, so soothing and so sweet, Hath something too of sternness and of pain. For it drives back my thoughts upon their spring By a strange introversion, and perforce I now begin to feed upon myself, Because I have nought else to feed upon \u2013 Am I alive or dead? I am not dead, But in the body still; for I possess A sort of confidence which clings to me, That each particular organ holds its place As heretofore, combining with the rest Into one symmetry, that wraps me round, And makes me man; and surely I could move, Did I but will it, every part of me. And yet I cannot to my sense bring home By very trial, that I have the power. \u2019Tis strange; I cannot stir a hand or foot, I cannot make my fingers or my lips By mutual pressure witness each to each, Nor by the eyelid\u2019s instantaneous stroke Assure myself I have a body still. Nor do I know my very attitude, Nor if I stand, or lie, or sit, or kneel. So much I know, not knowing how I know, That the vast universe, where I have dwelt, Is quitting me, or I am quitting it. Or I or it is rushing on the wings Of light or lightning on an onward course, And we e\u2019en now are million miles apart. Yet \u2026 is this peremptory severance Wrought out in lengthening measurements of space Which grow and multiply by speed and time? Or am I traversing infinity By endless subdivision, hurrying back From finite towards infinitesimal, Thus dying out of the expansive world? Another marvel: some one has me fast Within his ample palm; \u2018tis not a grasp Such as they use on earth, but all around Over the surface of my subtle being, As though I were a sphere, and capable To be accosted thus, a uniform And gentle pressure tells me I am not Self-moving, but borne forward on my way. And hark! I hear a singing; yet in sooth I cannot of that music rightly say Whether I hear, or touch, or taste the tones. Oh, what a heart-subduing melody! Until John Newman\u2019s recent canonisation, when news bulletins credited him with the title \u201cpoet\u201d, I had read none of his poems. I vaguely knew they\u2019d provided the text for Edward Elgar\u2019s 1900 choral work based on The Dream of Gerontius \u2013 the long work that includes this week\u2019s choice. I\u2019d sung a few of his hymns. But I\u2019d never thought the man of God a serious man of poems. Catching up with at least some of his verse \u2013 there\u2019s a considerable amount from a long life (1801\u20131890) \u2013 I\u2019ve found him more meditative than didactic. He can even be self-mocking, as in Opusculum, a witty occasional poem, with some innovative line breaks, beginning: \u201cFair Cousin, thy page / Is small to encage / The thoughts which engage / The mind of a sage, / Such as I am \u2026\u201d Here, the august cardinal and saint-to-be is simply an attractive minor Victorian poet, intelligently but comfortably inhabiting the skin of his social class. The Dream of Gerontius is a different matter, an ambitious work whose central dialogue, between a dreamer\u2019s soul and his guardian angel, includes choral sections (for \u201cAngelicals\u201d, Demon and others), litanies and hymns. By now a Catholic convert, Newman had an agenda for the poem \u2013 to examine, post-Dante, the workings of a purgatorial process for the soul during the journey of the afterlife. Interestingly, the poem ends with Gerontius about to be dipped in \u201cpenal waters\u201d by his solicitous Angel, as if Newman couldn\u2019t quite bring his gentle imagination to fully confront that terrible fire which, as the Angel explains elsewhere in the poem, is \u201cfire without its light\u201d. The poem was written in 1865. Newman claimed it happened \u201cby chance\u201d. Perhaps, drafting his thoughts on casual scraps of paper, Newman wanted to \u201cencage\u201d both prayers to his God and conversations with himself. The writer who emerges is not a great preacher or even a natural mystic. Newman is more reticent than many religious poets. It adds to what I least expected in him \u2013 sheer likability. The Soul of Gerontius is the second of the poem\u2019s seven episodes. In the first, Gerontius has experienced: \u201cThat sense of ruin which is worse than pain, / That masterful negation and collapse / Of all that makes us men.\u201d He has received the last sacrament. Now Newman\u2019s imagination takes on Gerontius\u2019s post-mortem consciousness. The blank verse of this section, regular in accent but never plodding, avoids heady exaltation, and sustains a sense of dreamlike uncertainty, without loosing succinctness.

Figures compiled by the UK-based charity suggest many of the children are under five years old. All were born to British parents suspected of joining Isis. Amid efforts by some European countries to repatriate children, and signs that the UK is taking similar steps, the figures underline the scale and difficulty of the problem and will add to pressure to evacuate the children. Older children who lived under Isis may have witnessed appalling acts of brutality, including beheadings, and may have been left with physical injuries and psychological needs from years of conflict and repression. \u201cChildren in Syria who have fled Isis-held areas are innocent,\u201d said Alison Griffin, of Save the Children. \u201cWe can and must give them the safety they need by bringing them to be cared for in the UK.\u201d What to do with accused Isis fighters and their families has been a pressing global security concern after Donald Trump\u2019s decision to suddenly withdraw all US forces from Syria, which prompted an incursion by Turkish forces. Last week three children believed to be UK citizens were evacuated from a detention camp at Ain Issa. While Save the Children welcomed a recent shift in the UK government\u2019s stance towards providing \u201csafe passage\u201d for British orphans to come to the UK, it said the vast majority of the children were with their mothers and all had been swept up in horrific events beyond their control. \u201cChildren whose parents are alive are just as innocent as those who have been orphaned,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cAll have been put through unimaginable horrors.

Among the first cases identified are three orphans believed to have travelled to Syria with their parents from London five years ago and who are currently in Raqqa, under the control of the Kurdish-dominated militia, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). Last week the Guardian reported on efforts by Belgium and other European states to begin preparing to evacuate citizens accused of having links to Isis from detention camps in north-east Syria through a newly declared \u201csafe zone\u201d being carved out by Turkish forces along the border.

Officials from the prime minister\u2019s department and the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, stonewalled during a Senate estimates hearing on Monday, declining to answer questions about Houston and the dinner on the basis the answers could be prejudicial to international relations. A series of questions were taken on notice. Wong was at pains to point out the refusal to disclose basic factual information \u2013 a pattern repeated across several estimates hearings on Monday \u2013 came on the same day that Australia\u2019s media organisations unleashed the Right to Know campaign against moves by successive federal governments to penalise whistleblowing and, in some cases, criminalise journalism. Morrison has refused for weeks to answer repeated questions from journalists and in parliament about whether he tried to get one of his religious mentors on the guest list for the invitation-only Rose Garden soiree but was ultimately thwarted by the White House. That development \u2013 never denied by the prime minister \u2013 was revealed first by the Wall Street Journal while the prime minister was on his American visit. A riled Wong told the hearing: \u201cI think the public has a right to know whether our prime minister asked for Mr Brian Houston to go to the White House.\u201d She declared Morrison should be \u201cfrankly man enough and brave enough to answer the question\u201d. Departmental officials told the hearing they had not supplied any suggestions to the White House for guests for the state dinner, but declined to answer whether or not Morrison\u2019s office had made suggestions, offering a formulation about answers being potentially prejudicial. When the official answering the question, Gerard Martin, indicated his answer to the question had been prepared after \u201cdiscussions within the department\u201d, Wong suggested his non-answer had been coached. PMC deputy secretary Stephanie Foster said officials always prepared themselves for estimates hearings, including for instances where answering the question could prejudice international relations. Wong queried how answering that question could prejudice international relations, and Cormann intervened. Last month, Guardian Australia filed a freedom of information request with the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet for documents and communications related to the state dinner and Brian Houston. The statutory response date was due to be Wednesday, but less than an hour after officials shut down questions about the dinner in Senate estimates, an FOI officer within the department emailed seeking a 30-day extension on processing the request because \u201cregrettably, the department is not currently in a position to finalise the decision on the FOI request.\u201d In addition to Monday\u2019s skirmishes over Houston, officials from Morrison\u2019s department told the hearing they could not provide information about who was the official point of contact within the government for the Barr investigation \u2013 a controversial probe established by Donald Trump aimed at discrediting the Mueller inquiry.

      "body": "<p>Any attempt by MPs to add a customs union to the government\u2019s Brexit deal would be \u201cprocedural tricks\u201d intended to frustrate departure, a senior minister has said, ahead of yet another potentially momentous day in parliament.</p> <p>Rishi Sunak, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said the Speaker, John Bercow, should grant the government a second Commons vote on its deal on Monday, and that it would be \u201cslightly odd\u201d if he did not.</p> <p>The expectation is that Bercow will not permit such a vote given that the deal was debated by MPs on Saturday, and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/19/mps-put-brakes-on-boris-johnsons-brexit-deal-with-rebel-letwin-amendment\">backbench amendment attached</a>, putting off final approval until the legislation surrounding the plan is agreed.</p> <p>Asked about the tight timetable surrounding departure from the EU \u2013 the government wants MPs to sit late or at the weekend if needed to meet the 31 October deadline \u2013 Sunak said parliament would have plenty of time to scrutinise the plan.</p> <p>He also said economic impact assessments of the deal were not necessary as MPs should first approve the process of withdrawal, and then focus on the future relationship with the EU.</p> <p>Labour is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/20/labour-seeks-new-alliance-to-kill-off-boris-johnsons-brexit-deal\">expected to seek to amend Brexit legislation</a> to attach a UK-wide customs union, something it hopes the DUP, which opposes the plan negotiated by Boris Johnson, could back.</p> <p>Sunak said amendments such as a customs union or making support for the deal conditional on a confirmatory referendum, were meant to wreck the process.</p> <p>\u201cPeople who are wanting to amend legislation are ultimately wanting to frustrate, delay or cancel Brexit altogether, and we should be clear about that,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a deal that has been negotiated with the EU, that they themselves are happy with, and now want to get on with. I think everyone will look at that and think, this isn\u2019t the time for more games in parliament, more amendments, more procedural tricks, which are just covers for trying to frustrate Brexit altogether.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking earlier to BBC1\u2019s Breakfast programme, Sunak said economic assessments were not needed: \u201cWhat we\u2019re talking about when we talk about economic assessments is the future relationship, and that obviously is something that needs to be negotiated.

      "bodyText": "Any attempt by MPs to add a customs union to the government\u2019s Brexit deal would be \u201cprocedural tricks\u201d intended to frustrate departure, a senior minister has said, ahead of yet another potentially momentous day in parliament. Rishi Sunak, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said the Speaker, John Bercow, should grant the government a second Commons vote on its deal on Monday, and that it would be \u201cslightly odd\u201d if he did not. The expectation is that Bercow will not permit such a vote given that the deal was debated by MPs on Saturday, and a backbench amendment attached, putting off final approval until the legislation surrounding the plan is agreed. Asked about the tight timetable surrounding departure from the EU \u2013 the government wants MPs to sit late or at the weekend if needed to meet the 31 October deadline \u2013 Sunak said parliament would have plenty of time to scrutinise the plan. He also said economic impact assessments of the deal were not necessary as MPs should first approve the process of withdrawal, and then focus on the future relationship with the EU. Labour is expected to seek to amend Brexit legislation to attach a UK-wide customs union, something it hopes the DUP, which opposes the plan negotiated by Boris Johnson, could back. Sunak said amendments such as a customs union or making support for the deal conditional on a confirmatory referendum, were meant to wreck the process. \u201cPeople who are wanting to amend legislation are ultimately wanting to frustrate, delay or cancel Brexit altogether, and we should be clear about that,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cWe have a deal that has been negotiated with the EU, that they themselves are happy with, and now want to get on with. I think everyone will look at that and think, this isn\u2019t the time for more games in parliament, more amendments, more procedural tricks, which are just covers for trying to frustrate Brexit altogether.\u201d Speaking earlier to BBC1\u2019s Breakfast programme, Sunak said economic assessments were not needed: \u201cWhat we\u2019re talking about when we talk about economic assessments is the future relationship, and that obviously is something that needs to be negotiated. Parliament will have its say on that process. \u201cBut I would say this: this is about restoring trust in politics, ending the division of the last three years. No impact assessment or spreadsheet could convey the value of doing that if we could support this deal.\u201d Sunak said he would expect Bercow to grant a second vote: \u201cThe Speaker has always said that he would allow parliament to find a way to express an opinion on something. I think it\u2019s pretty clear that parliament does want to express an opinion on this incredibly important matter.\u201d But Jonathan Ashworth, Labour\u2019s shadow health secretary, said he would be surprised if Bercow allowed a fresh vote. \u201cThe government is trying to bring back a vote that was dealt with in the House of Commons on Saturday,\u201d he told Today. \u201cI don\u2019t understand how that is within the rules of the House of Commons, given on Saturday we amended that motion and that motion passed.\u201d Ashworth, who said it was \u201cutterly irresponsible\u201d that MPs should be asked to approve a Brexit plan without even seeing the associated legislation, rejected the idea that a customs union amendment was an attempt to derail the process. \u201cWe\u2019re not attempting to wreck it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re attempting to safeguard the British economy, to safeguard jobs and public services.\u201d Johnson was forced to send the EU a letter seeking another Brexit extension after his first attempt to push his deal through the Commons on Saturday was amended, although the EU will wait to see whether this will be needed. Ministers are hopeful that if Bercow was to allow another vote, Johnson might have a sufficiently large coalition of MPs for it to pass, with the help of some Labour rebels and the bulk of the strongly pro-Brexit wing of the Conservative party. Steve Baker, who chairs the Tory hardline Brexit supporting European Research Group, said he was committed to the deal \u2013 and said the DUP should do the same, despite the party\u2019s opposition to separate customs arrangements for Northern Ireland under Johnson\u2019s plan, something the PM had previously ruled out. \u201cThe point is that for people like me, vast areas of that withdrawal agreement are unchanged, and we are going to have to choke down our pride and vote in the national interests to get Brexit done, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to be doing.\u201d \u201cI am afraid I am asking the DUP, just as we are having to choke down extremely difficult compromises to get out in the national interest, I think on this issue,\u201d he told Today. \u201cThis is a potentially a temporary arrangement, which will be superseded with a free trade agreement.

The difference between the two Shinings is illuminating: Kubrick reshaped it as a psychological horror, more interested in the demons within; King\u2019s stories, by contrast, avoid ambiguity. Rather, King\u2019s tales often reassure us that the horror is not within ourselves. For some reason, we can\u2019t get enough of hearing that.",

      "body": "<p>Maria Nantale is enjoying a beer at a rickety wooden bar after a long day\u2019s work. \u201cForty people tested today,\u201d she reflects. \u201cFound three positives. One of them is in denial. She has run away.\u201d</p> <p>Twice a week, from dawn until dusk, Nantale holds an \u201coutreach\u201d in the town of Mbale, population 76,000. The aim is to combat HIV among those most at risk: LGBT Ugandans, drug addicts and sex workers.</p> <p>She asks a local person to play some music while her \u201cpeer\u201d educators discuss condom use and sexual health, and invite people to get tested for HIV. Her mobile lab is run by a trio of nurses, a lab technician and a psychological counsellor.</p> <p>Uganda has the <a href=\"https://www.afro.who.int/sites/default/files/2017-08/UPHIA%20Uganda%20factsheet.pdf\">10th highest rate of HIV</a> in the world \u2013 6.2% overall and 7.6% among women. Across the country, more than 1.2 million people are believed to carry the virus that causes Aids.</p> <p>It is also one of the most homophobic countries in the world. Earlier this month an LGBT advocate was <a href=\"https://sexualminoritiesuganda.com/uganda-must-not-condone-violence-towards-the-lgbti-community/\">killed</a> in the eastern Ugandan town of Jinja, not far from where Nantale works in Mbale. Last week, lawmakers said they would <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/6416bdd9fdfb4a99b742290de1259c76\">introduce legislation</a> to bring in tougher punishments for homosexual acts, conjuring memories of the so-called \u201ckill the gays\u201d bill that was proposed in 2013 and initially included the death penalty for certain cases.</p> <p>As the law stands, homosexual acts can lead to sentences of up to 14 years in prison. LGBT people routinely face human and legal rights abuses by employers and police, or violence and harassment in their communities. Because homosexuality is illegal, LGBT people are often hesitant to seek medical attention for HIV/Aids.</p> <p>That\u2019s why Nantale\u2019s primary goal is to reach Mbale\u2019s gay and <a href=\"https://crowd360.org/in-rural-uganda-one-trans-woman-fights-for-hiv-care-for-all/\">transgender populations</a>, and sex workers, who are at a higher risk of HIV. Studies estimate that sex workers in Uganda are about a third more likely to be HIV positive.</p> <p>The problem, says Nantale, is that many people in marginalised groups don\u2019t get tested for the virus due to the double stigma of being both HIV positive and queer in a homophobic country. Nantale realised she needed to offer tests to everybody or risk giving credence to the belief that LGBT people are \u201csick\u201d or diseased.</p> <p>A further complication is the fact that many rural LGBT Ugandans are transient or even homeless, having been ostracised by their families. By inviting entire communities to get tested in a public setting, Nantale creates a safe space for the most vulnerable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ffe4b52678e1317dc4553a6aa41075fca3a329b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ffe4b52678e1317dc4553a6aa41075fca3a329b/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An outreach event largely staffed by LGBT people\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An outreach event largely staffed by LGBT people.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jake Naughton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a strategy we use so that the LGBTI, sex workers and drug users can come out and get tested,\u201d says Nantale. \u201cWhenever people here have HIV, they run in the opposite direction. That\u2019s what the counselling is for. Telling them it will all be fine.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/oct/26/tax-on-drinks-to-raise-funds-for-hiv-treatment-in-uganda\">Tax on drinks to raise funds for HIV treatment in Uganda</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As a lesbian herself and an outspoken woman in a male-dominated community, gaining people\u2019s trust was no easy task. \u201cThis has taken me years,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Nantale, director of the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Eastern-Region-Womens-Empowerment-Organization-ERWEO-1766428463589067/\">Eastern Region Women\u2019s Empowerment Organisation</a>, is an anomaly in Uganda. Most Ugandan LGBT activists busy themselves with a plethora of other problems, such as being arrested or extorted by police, or blackmailed by neighbours. Many teenagers are disowned by their families, and some are forced to flee Uganda as refugees.</p> <p>The method employed by the impeccably dressed, energetic anti-HIV campaigner is to attack that stigma head on, testing and counselling people outside and in public, in front of their friends, neighbours and family. One afternoon, residents looked on as a tall man in his 40s walked up to the collection of tables, benches and blankets Nantale\u2019s team had set up on a small patch of land in one of Mbale\u2019s crowded, low-income neighbourhoods. A nurse cleaned the man\u2019s finger with a swab, then lightly pricked the tip. A tiny droplet of blood appeared, which she smeared on to a small white strip of testing paper, then used a cotton swab to stop the bleeding. Ten minutes later, his result was announced in front of the dozen or so people who were standing around: negative.</p> <p>Nantale says that once a few people get over the initial hurdle of participating, the entire neighbourhood tends to join in. \u201cSome of them go and bring their partners. They bring their man,\u201d says Nantale. She describes one octogenarian great-grandmother who never misses a test, just to feel apart of what\u2019s going on. Nantale\u2019s peer educators hand out male and female condoms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c875eacedd849fec457e7dce72205612d664fe6b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c875eacedd849fec457e7dce72205612d664fe6b/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man is tested for HIV\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man is tested for HIV at an outreach event.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jake Naughton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nantale\u2019s approach has garnered the attention of Ugandan LGBT rights organisations such as Sexual Minorities Uganda, and works with them on HIV/Aids awareness events. Her work has also attracted international donors such as USAid , which has funded her mobile clinics and implements the President\u2019s Emergency Plan For Aids Relief (Pepfar) , a multibillion dollar global initiative that has proven incredibly effective at preventing and treating HIV/Aids.</p> <p>But the work doesn\u2019t always go smoothly. One evening after an outreach session, Nantale spent nearly an hour searching for an HIV-positive trans teenager who had run away, throwing her antiretroviral medication into a drainage ditch out of shame, desperation, or both. Nantale tries to counsel those who test positive by explaining that HIV is not a death sentence. But for LGBT Ugandans, the roots of their depression often go far deeper than concerns about their own health.</p> <p>\u201cOf the three people who tested positive that day, one was a lesbian, raped by her uncle,\u201d says Nantale. \u201cShe\u2019s devastated. She\u2019s resting just nearby.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/oct/17/soap-opera-could-be-unlikely-form-birth-control-uganda\">Soap opera could be unlikely form of birth control in Uganda</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Numerous LGBT residents say violence is a common occurrence. Nantale herself says she was thrown into the path of a truck by a man hired by a group of village elders. \u201cThey paid a boda boda guy [motorcycle taxi driver] to kill me,\u201d she says. \u201cHomophobes,\u201d she shrugs. Her LGBT activism is what drew the hit, but it was also what saved her. \u201cFortunately one of our sex workers, he recognised me for giving him free condoms. He put me in his trailer and rushed me to the hospital.\u201d</p> <p>Nantale spent several weeks in a coma. Now she lives with her partner and their son in a safe house, with a security guard.

      "bodyText": "Maria Nantale is enjoying a beer at a rickety wooden bar after a long day\u2019s work. \u201cForty people tested today,\u201d she reflects. \u201cFound three positives. One of them is in denial. She has run away.\u201d Twice a week, from dawn until dusk, Nantale holds an \u201coutreach\u201d in the town of Mbale, population 76,000. The aim is to combat HIV among those most at risk: LGBT Ugandans, drug addicts and sex workers. She asks a local person to play some music while her \u201cpeer\u201d educators discuss condom use and sexual health, and invite people to get tested for HIV. Her mobile lab is run by a trio of nurses, a lab technician and a psychological counsellor. Uganda has the 10th highest rate of HIV in the world \u2013 6.2% overall and 7.6% among women. Across the country, more than 1.2 million people are believed to carry the virus that causes Aids. It is also one of the most homophobic countries in the world. Earlier this month an LGBT advocate was killed in the eastern Ugandan town of Jinja, not far from where Nantale works in Mbale. Last week, lawmakers said they would introduce legislation to bring in tougher punishments for homosexual acts, conjuring memories of the so-called \u201ckill the gays\u201d bill that was proposed in 2013 and initially included the death penalty for certain cases. As the law stands, homosexual acts can lead to sentences of up to 14 years in prison. LGBT people routinely face human and legal rights abuses by employers and police, or violence and harassment in their communities. Because homosexuality is illegal, LGBT people are often hesitant to seek medical attention for HIV/Aids. That\u2019s why Nantale\u2019s primary goal is to reach Mbale\u2019s gay and transgender populations, and sex workers, who are at a higher risk of HIV. Studies estimate that sex workers in Uganda are about a third more likely to be HIV positive. The problem, says Nantale, is that many people in marginalised groups don\u2019t get tested for the virus due to the double stigma of being both HIV positive and queer in a homophobic country. Nantale realised she needed to offer tests to everybody or risk giving credence to the belief that LGBT people are \u201csick\u201d or diseased. A further complication is the fact that many rural LGBT Ugandans are transient or even homeless, having been ostracised by their families. By inviting entire communities to get tested in a public setting, Nantale creates a safe space for the most vulnerable. \u201cIt\u2019s a strategy we use so that the LGBTI, sex workers and drug users can come out and get tested,\u201d says Nantale. \u201cWhenever people here have HIV, they run in the opposite direction. That\u2019s what the counselling is for. Telling them it will all be fine.\u201d As a lesbian herself and an outspoken woman in a male-dominated community, gaining people\u2019s trust was no easy task. \u201cThis has taken me years,\u201d she says. Nantale, director of the Eastern Region Women\u2019s Empowerment Organisation, is an anomaly in Uganda. Most Ugandan LGBT activists busy themselves with a plethora of other problems, such as being arrested or extorted by police, or blackmailed by neighbours. Many teenagers are disowned by their families, and some are forced to flee Uganda as refugees. The method employed by the impeccably dressed, energetic anti-HIV campaigner is to attack that stigma head on, testing and counselling people outside and in public, in front of their friends, neighbours and family. One afternoon, residents looked on as a tall man in his 40s walked up to the collection of tables, benches and blankets Nantale\u2019s team had set up on a small patch of land in one of Mbale\u2019s crowded, low-income neighbourhoods. A nurse cleaned the man\u2019s finger with a swab, then lightly pricked the tip. A tiny droplet of blood appeared, which she smeared on to a small white strip of testing paper, then used a cotton swab to stop the bleeding. Ten minutes later, his result was announced in front of the dozen or so people who were standing around: negative. Nantale says that once a few people get over the initial hurdle of participating, the entire neighbourhood tends to join in. \u201cSome of them go and bring their partners. They bring their man,\u201d says Nantale. She describes one octogenarian great-grandmother who never misses a test, just to feel apart of what\u2019s going on. Nantale\u2019s peer educators hand out male and female condoms. Nantale\u2019s approach has garnered the attention of Ugandan LGBT rights organisations such as Sexual Minorities Uganda, and works with them on HIV/Aids awareness events. Her work has also attracted international donors such as USAid , which has funded her mobile clinics and implements the President\u2019s Emergency Plan For Aids Relief (Pepfar) , a multibillion dollar global initiative that has proven incredibly effective at preventing and treating HIV/Aids. But the work doesn\u2019t always go smoothly. One evening after an outreach session, Nantale spent nearly an hour searching for an HIV-positive trans teenager who had run away, throwing her antiretroviral medication into a drainage ditch out of shame, desperation, or both. Nantale tries to counsel those who test positive by explaining that HIV is not a death sentence. But for LGBT Ugandans, the roots of their depression often go far deeper than concerns about their own health. \u201cOf the three people who tested positive that day, one was a lesbian, raped by her uncle,\u201d says Nantale. \u201cShe\u2019s devastated. She\u2019s resting just nearby.\u201d Numerous LGBT residents say violence is a common occurrence. Nantale herself says she was thrown into the path of a truck by a man hired by a group of village elders. \u201cThey paid a boda boda guy [motorcycle taxi driver] to kill me,\u201d she says. \u201cHomophobes,\u201d she shrugs. Her LGBT activism is what drew the hit, but it was also what saved her. \u201cFortunately one of our sex workers, he recognised me for giving him free condoms. He put me in his trailer and rushed me to the hospital.\u201d Nantale spent several weeks in a coma. Now she lives with her partner and their son in a safe house, with a security guard. She takes different routes to her office and to the outreach sessions, to avoid a repeat attack. Verbal abuse has forced some of Nantale\u2019s friends to leave Mbale for Uganda\u2019s more metropolitan capital. Life in Kampala offers a certain anonymity and freedom but also leaves many of them feeling isolated, lonely or depressed. \u201cI could go to Kampala,\u201d says Nantale, \u201cbut my grandma lives here. My uncle lives here.\u201d To move is, in some ways, to leave one\u2019s family behind. But the same families can ostracise. According to a 2016 global attitudes survey, 53% of Ugandans say that homosexuality should be a crime \u2013 the highest margin of all 10 African nations that were polled \u2013 and 19% say they would be upset if their child fell in love with someone of the same sex. But in the same survey, nearly 40% agreed that bullying of LGBT people is a significant problem. Such awareness, Nantale says, is cause for optimism. Nantale believes that attitudes in Mbale are beginning to shift. Just five years ago, after Uganda passed its new anti-gay law, Nantale was outed by the local newspapers as a lesbian. She was fired from her job, ridiculed in public. But now entire neighbourhoods know her by name, and respect her for her work providing healthcare in neglected communities. \u201cI want people to focus more on my work, not on my orientation,\u201d she says.",

      "bodyText": "A 16-year-old girl was left fearful and in tears after she was forced to strip naked in front of police at a music festival last year. On Monday the New South Wales Law Enforcement Conduct Commission opened a four-day inquiry into the allegedly unlawful strip-search of the girl at the 2018 Splendour in the Grass festival near Byron Bay. The inquiry heard the girl \u2013 whose name has been suppressed \u2013 was one of six children who were strip-searched at the event without a parent or guardian present, a breach of police search powers. It is alleged police asked the girl her age and took her identification but did not call her parents or anyone else capable of caring for her, a breach of their search powers. After a false positive indication by a sniffer dog, the girl was taken by police to a tent inside the festival grounds and told to remove her clothing. \u201cAt that point I realised I was going to have to get naked in front of this police officer,\u201d the girl said in a statement read out by counsel assisting the commissioner, Peggy Dwyer. \u201cI could not believe this was happening to me; I could not stop crying; I was completely humiliated. A strip-search is by necessity a grave intrusion of a citizen\u2019s privacy and dignity.\u201d In NSW, police are only permitted to carry out field strip-searches if the urgency and seriousness of the situation requires it. In the case of minors a parent or guardian must be present unless an immediate search is deemed necessary to protect the person or prevent evidence being destroyed. The commission heard evidence that drugs were found in less than 10% of the 143 strip-searches carried out at the festival. In her opening address to the inquiry, Dwyer said that absent a legal justification for a strip-search \u201cit would constitute an assault\u201d. \u201cAnd I anticipate that the commission will hear that it is capable of causing great distress and lasting harm,\u201d she said. In her statement, the girl said it was \u201cdistressing and upsetting\u201d to think about the incident and that it had made her feel as though she can no longer trust police. \u201cI was absolutely shocked that the police would do this to me,\u201d she said in her statement. \u201cEvery time I saw a police officer at the festival I started to feel anxious.

Why? </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Morrison</strong>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Mr Speaker, as members opposite would know, the program and schedule of projects, which the government pursues, one that is put together in partnership with the states and territories as we seek to implement that plan. <br></p> <p>And, Mr Speaker, and indeed whether it\u2019s with local government even on projects that we pursue, our job is to ensure that we provide the allocation of the funds and to set the priority projects and to sit down with the state and territory governments. <br></p> <p>Now those opposite would know, and in particular the leader of the opposition would know, from his time when he served as a minister for infrastructure, that the scheduling of projects is set out together with the states and territories and the profile for the delivery of those projects is often revised based on the advice provided by those states and territories. <br></p> <p>And that is why the changes in the schedule arrive as they have. I\u2019d make this point, though. Under our government, this year we will spend around $10bn on infrastructure. That is what is budged to be spent in this very financial year. All around the country. <br></p> <p>Now, Mr Speaker, that\u2019s almost double, almost double, what we inherited from the Labor party when we came to government and the leader of the opposition, who sits at the table now, I think from memory, and I\u2019ll be happy to stand corrected on this figure, but I understand the figure at that time was around $6bn. <br></p> <p>And so this year we\u2019re spending $10bn or thereabouts just slightly less than that, and the reason we\u2019re doing that is because two budgets ago we decided to put in place the $75bn pipeline of projects over 10 years, and in the last budget, recognising the difficult situation that we\u2019re facing in the global economy, we increased that pipeline of investments over the next 10 years $100bn. <br></p> <p>We upped it, Mr Speaker, because we knew that\u2019s what the Australian economy would need just not now but over the next 10 years and, more importantly than that, we have the budget discipline and the budget to back those sorts of commitments up. <br></p> <p>So, Mr Speaker, the reason for any change in schedules is not because of the lack of fiscal capacity or discipline because of this government but because of any changes to scheduling that is done in relation to our negotiations with the states and territories. <br></p> <p>Well, I know from those opposite when they\u2019re in government the reason they cut defence spending the reason they don\u2019t list pharmaceuticals, the reason they have to [insert] flood levies and all these things is because they never know how to manage money.

In addition to that, Mr Speaker, the tax cuts that were legislated by this country, fought against by the Labor party, who said these shouldn\u2019t happen and in fact the Labor party argued at the election that we should be imposing $387bn of higher taxes. <br></p> <p> Higher taxes on the Australian economy. I don\u2019t know what sort of a stimulus package $387bn of higher taxes constitutes, but that was the description that was ... member for Lyons. <br></p> <p>That was offered by the shadow treasurer when he was the shadow finance minister and he was the joint architect, Mr Speaker, with the former shadow treasurer and the former leader of the opposition who said they thought at this time of great uncertainty in the global economy that adding $387bn to the tax burden of Australians would be a good idea. Now, we don\u2019t share that view, Mr Speaker. We believe and we have demonstrated in our budget that the right way to go about addressing the issue in the global economy, indeed in the domestic economy is the stable and considered approach of rolling out our program of reducing the costs of doing business, whether it\u2019s on removing unnecessary regulation, ensuring that we\u2019re training people for the skills needs of the future, delivering tax relief to Australians, taking further out, Mr Speaker, our trade barriers to ensure that we\u2019re dealing with in more and more countries in the world, taking our trade agreements coverage from 26% to 70%, and we\u2019re seeking to go further. <br></p> <p>So, that is the economic plan that we took to the election. The Labor party would have us engage in the reckless spending policies that they last implemented when the member ... who asked the question ... the member for Rankin, and instituted one of the most reckless, reckless spending packages which crashed the budget and took money away from things like pharmaceuticals, defence spending and a whole range of other important priorities \u2018cause the Labor party did not know how to manage money. <br></p> <p>Now, he refers to the governor of the Reserve Bank and I\u2019m happy to quote him. \u2018The Australian economy\u2019, on 1 October, \u2018Appears to have reached a turning point. The economy has been through a soft patch recently but we are expecting a return to around trend growth over the next year. <br></p> <p>There are a number of factors that are supporting this outlook. These include the low level of interest rates, the recent tax cuts, ongoing spending on infrastructure, signs of stabilise identification in established housing markets.\u2019 <br></p> </blockquote> <p>Just your standard reminder that the GFC happened when Labor was in power.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-21T03:29:38.623Z\">at 4.29am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5dad23fc8f08142786c4f6ed\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-21T03:21:03.479Z\">4.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The department of agriculture has put out this statement, after the footage of horses being mistreated was shown on the ABC\u2019s 7.30<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The regulation of animal welfare remains the responsibility of the states and territories.</p> <p>The Department of Agriculture\u2019s role is limited to export abattoirs where it works to ensure Australian export standards are met.</p> <p>Consistent with the department\u2019s responsibilities, we are conducting a critical incident audit of the facility at the centre of recent footage depicting the mistreatment of horses.</p> <p>Queensland authorities are working closely with the department on this audit.</p> <p>A preliminary report will be produced early this week.</p> <p>The department will then determine any regulatory action to be taken.</p> <p>The department understands that Queensland has requested the original footage from the ABC, which will assist in determining a number of important factors, such as when the incidents took place.</p> <p>The department urges anyone with evidence or concerns about animal welfare to immediately report it to the relevant state jurisdiction.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dad23ca8f0898437061a7e6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/lisa-cox\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-21T03:20:08.129Z\">4.20am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In environment estimates Greens senator <strong>Sarah Hanson-Young</strong> is asking about the statutory review of Australia\u2019s environment laws (the EPBC Act) that is due to commence this month.<br></p> <p>The department confirms it will begin in the next 10 days but doesn\u2019t have a date.

The first of those components is to ensure the direct financial support and assistance as is the responsibilities of the commonwealth under the national drought agreement which was revised and updated after that drought summit which made it very clear that it was the commonwealth\u2019s responsibility to look after the income support and other financial assistance to farmhouse holds and those communities, and issues such as fodder subsidies and subsidies and the direct care of animals and others involved in the welfare of the farms themselves. </p> <p>That was the responsibility of the states and territories. So the reforms we have made to Farm Household Allowance alone means with a period of just over four years with the announcement last year that individual households will have received as couples $125,000 in direct financial support. </p> <p>Not alone but direct financial support over and above what they are able to do in terms of earning off farm income which we lifted the threshold up to $100,000 and that enables them even with that off farm income to access the Farm Household Allowance. </p> <p>There was drought to drought affected communities through a community. So it\u2019s not just about farmers and graziers, it\u2019s also about the communities that are infect \u2013 affected and we have invested in over 120 councils and their shire areas to ensure wear supporting the continuation and growth of their economies during difficult times and of course we have invested in water resilience. That\u2019s our plan. We\u2019re getting on with it. We\u2019ll continue to get on with it will being to farming communities. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-21T03:14:58.568Z\">at 4.14am

<strong>Pauline Hanson:</strong><br></p> <p>#notallcorals</p> <p>A defiant <strong>Pauline Hanson</strong> has maintained coral bleaching is a natural occurrence, in an exchange with the chief scientist of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority.</p> <p>The Queenslander used a Senate estimates hearing on Monday to question the link between heatwaves and back-to-back mass coral bleaching events in 2016 and 2017.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying that coral bleaching is affected by water temperatures,\u201d she told <strong>David Wachenfeld. </strong></p> <p>\u201cYet around Indonesia, closer to the equator ... where the water temperatures are 29C, it\u2019s a known fact that coral actually grows faster and more prolific in warmer temperatures.\u201d<br></p> <p>Dr Wachenfeld explained that corals live in a variety of water temperatures over the world, with substantial differences even within the Great Barrier Reef.</p> <p>Corals bleach when stressed \u2013 such as when exposed to warmer than normal temperatures \u2013 and die if stressed for prolonged periods, he told the senator.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact that corals in Indonesia could withstand higher temperatures than corals on the central Great Barrier Reef is of no benefit to the corals of the central Great Barrier Reef when they die.\u201d<br></p> <p>But Senator Hanson was not swayed, asking how the authority planned to address both water temperatures and the \u201cnatural occurrence\u201d of bleaching events with its taxpayer funding.</p> <p>The GBRMPA is trying to stamp out crown-of-thorns starfish, improve water quality in catchments while urging for greater global action on climate change, Senator Hanson was told.</p> <p>The authority recently released its latest five-year outlook for the reef, that found it to be \u201cvery poor\u201d unless more action was taken to slow climate change.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time

<strong>Angus Taylor</strong> grasslands saga. Specifically, they were asked about occasions when the former minister <strong>Josh Frydenberg</strong> or his office sought information about the investigation into alleged illegal land clearing by Jam Land Pty Ltd, which Minister Taylor part owns.</p> <p>Labor\u2019s <strong>Katy Gallagher </strong>has asked the questions to follow up on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/15/frydenberg-sought-urgent-details-on-angus-taylor-grasslands-investigation\">this story by Guardian Australia last week</a>.</p> <p><strong>Monica Collins</strong>, the department\u2019s chief of compliance, lists some dates in July, August and October 2017.</p> <p>But Gallagher is interested in some earlier requests from the minister\u2019s office in February 2017. As revealed by Guardian last week, an email shows staff were asked to prepare \u201curgent\u201d talking points about the grasslands listing after a compliance case was raised in parliament. But searches by Guardian Australia of Hansard records found no mention of it.</p> <p>Today, Collins confirms the department also went looking for a Hansard record at the time and they, too, found nothing.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure where that request came into the office but my recollection of that document is that it was on the basis with a phone call with somebody,\u201d she told the hearing.</p> <p>\u201cI know that staff also searched Hansard and didn\u2019t find a direct mention of it in parliament.</p> <p>Gallagher: \u201cSo they did [a search] on that date? Around the time the request came in, they did a search to see whether it had been mentioned in the parliament?\u201d</p> <p>Collins: \u201cYes that\u2019s right\u201d</p> <p>Gallagher: \u201cAnd, could they find anything?\u201d</p> <p>Collins: No, nothing specific. Nothing specific about Jam Land and grasslands.</p> <p>Collins says the information supplied to Frydenberg\u2019s office was \u201cvery high level\u201d in terms of \u201ca brief update on the investigation, some information about the grasslands listing\u201d and things of that nature.</p> <p>The Greens senator <strong>Larissa Waters</strong> asks when the department conducted site visits to the Jam Land property near Delegate in NSW and when it first launched proceedings against Jam Land.<br></p> <p>Collins says she can\u2019t give dates of site visits because the investigation is ongoing, but there have been four site visits. She said the department received the report about alleged illegal clearing in November 2016 and first wrote to Jam Land in December 2016.<br></p> <p>Waters asked why the investigation has taken nearly three years.<br></p> <p>Collins says a lot of factors influence this, such as the caseload of individual officers, but \u201cwe\u2019re hoping to conclude it very soon\u201d. <br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-21T02:35:24.826Z\">at 3.35am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5dad13778f0859498cfb1e4f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-21T02:11:02.443Z\">3.11am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Senate estimate committees are all on a lunch break and the House is on the downhill slide to question time, so it\u2019s a catch your breath moment.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-21T02:11:53.783Z\">at 3.11am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5dad0b168f08c78d1cb4f0ca\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-21T01:34:25.223Z\">2.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The climate emergency motion debate ran out of time \u2013 it will continue tomorrow. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-21T01:36:44.253Z\">at 2.36am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5dad0a0d8f0859498cfb1e44\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-21T01:31:00.914Z\">2.31am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Penny Wong</strong> says she understands US senator <strong>Lindsay Graham</strong> wrote to the prime minister on 2 October ... but we go to the scheduled break before we can see if this is a question <strong>Mathias Cormann</strong> will allow the PM&amp;C officials to answer.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-21T01:38:46.454Z\">at 2.38am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5dad08bf8f08142786c4f6b5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/sarah-martin\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-21T01:24:53.801Z\">2.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Also, a couple of extra bits from the Albanese press conference: he addresses the rumour that Labor MP <strong>Mike Kelly</strong> might trigger a byelection in his marginal seat of Eden-Monaro, saying Kelly will be here \u201cfor a long time\u201d and is an \u201cimportant member of the team\u201d.</p> <p>He says the only way that the government will be able to claw back the seat will be to beat him in an election.</p> <p>Albanese is also asked about the Right to Know campaign, saying he agrees on the importance of a free press and commenting that it is \u201cunacceptable\u201d that journalists should be facing criminal prosecution.<br></p> <p>The Labor leader is also asked why only five MPs were in the chamber when the opposition introduced its climate emergency motion, saying that was \u201cwhat happened in parliament\u201d and it was no reflection of the importance of motions or legislation.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-21T01:27:44.753Z\">at 2.27am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5dad071c8f0898437061a7b3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-21T01:19:57.135Z\">2.19am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back in estimates, <strong>Penny Wong</strong> says she is just trying to work out how Australia went from \u201cwe\u2019ll co-operate if asked\u201d, which is what <strong>Marise Payne</strong> said, to <strong>Joe Hockey </strong>proactively sending a letter saying we would help.</p> <p> This is all taken on notice.<br></p> <p>\u201cThis is the most interventionist you\u2019ve ever been,\u201d Wong says.</p> <p>\u201c...

If you\u2019re not having a war cabinet involving non-government members in an actual time of war, and I point out that at the time of world war two breaking out, Sir Robert Menzies then, in the UAP who had sought to form coalitions both with the Labor party and the Country party at the time at a time of war, and that didn\u2019t come to effect and ultimately a Labor government was formed at that time under John Curtin. </p> <p>So they can make those proposals, but our government is filled, both in cabinet and on our benches, of Australians who have a direct experience and live in drought-affected communities, right across New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and South Australia, and indeed from other states where drought has affected them in the past.

Here is what he had to say:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think what we saw today is that there is much analysis about the relationships that countries have with China and I think there is indeed a lot of over-analysis of those relationships and whether it\u2019s the United States and China, or anyone else. And I simply made the point, which was well received, that Australia is an independent sovereign nation. </p> <p>Yes, we are very much proud of our western liberal democratic tradition, our open economy and our engagement with the rest of the world, and that gives us a set of eyes that look into the world very much from our perspective. And I respect the fact that whether it\u2019s China, or indeed Indonesia or any other country in this part of the world, they will have their unique perspective and that\u2019s all fine. There\u2019s no issues with that. </p> <p>But what we also stressed today was, is that we will never feel corralled into any sort of binary assessment of these relationships. Binary assessments of a relationship which says pro-United States or pro-China, as Australia has a comprehensive strategic partnership with China and we have an enduring, and incredibly important alliance with the United States which is fundamental to our security. We have our biggest investment partnership with the United States and our biggest trade partnership with China and these are not mutually exclusive. </p> <p>And the comments that I\u2019ve made, particularly more recently which have been quite stoically in support of this independent, anti-binary view, I think are very well received. I took the opportunity to congratulate China on where they were able to get to with the United States on the first phase of their trade discussions. I think that\u2019s very good for the global economy and I think it bears out the optimism that we\u2019ve always had about rejecting this binary nature.</p> <p>It\u2019s simply a fact that China has arrived at an incredibly impressive point in its economic history. It\u2019s impossible to dispute that. And that means that they\u2019ve done incredibly well and raises their level of technological achievement and capability. Similarly, more broadly in their economy but also say, militarily, and that\u2019s a reflection of the significant progress they\u2019ve made over that time. And so, you know, one can only acknowledge that and then pursue our partnership based on our interests, which are aligned with China to the extent that we have both done so incredibly well out of their success. And so that was the dominating part of our discussion today.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-20T21:41:39.504Z\">at 10.41pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5dacd0aa8f08142786c4f650\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/katharine-murphy\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-20T21:25:22.252Z\">10.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Morrison uses weekend visit to Jakarta to seek a diplomatic thaw with China</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It\u2019s interesting that the prime minister used a visit to observe the Indonesian president <strong>Joko Widodo\u2019s</strong> inauguration to have a meeting with the Chinese vice-president, <strong>Wang Qishan</strong>.<br></p> <p>I\u2019ve written a lot over the past month or two about <strong>Scott Morrison\u2019s</strong> efforts to align Australia and the US but less about the effort over the same time period to warm up the relationship with Beijing. </p> <p>Over the past couple of months, the foreign minister, <strong>Marise Payne</strong>, has met her Chinese counterpart twice (most recently in New York during UN leaders week), and now this meeting in Jakarta. </p> <p>Australia sought the meeting and it was approved by the Chinese president, <strong>Xi Jinping</strong>.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-20T21:40:27.214Z\">at 10.40pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5dacc9698f08993584c89b42\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-20T21:00:36.762Z\">10.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Anthony Albanese </strong>was also asked about press freedoms yesterday \u2013and why Labor is now pushing for change </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, the urgency is that what we didn\u2019t see under Labor governments was consecutive raids on journalists.

Penny Wong is now asking the PM&amp;C officials whether they are aware of any international agreements Australia has entered into unwillingly. They are not. *fin* \u201cWhen you say this unaccountable, unelected international bureaucracy \u2013 the only thing you can point to is they give us lectures,\u201d Penny Wong says. Mathias Cormann eventually concedes that \u201cthey\u201d can\u2019t direct us, but from \u201ctime to time\u201d \u201cthey\u201d try. Wong wants him to take on notice who \u201cthey are\u201d. Cormann won\u2019t because he says he has answered who \u201cthey\u201d are. (He has not) \u201cI am asking the department to take on notice who the \u2018they\u2019 is ... which organisations are included in the \u2018they\u2019 [in the prime minister\u2019s speech].\u201d This is an actual exchange in Senate estimates and not a rebooted Laurel and Hardy sketch. Mathias Cormann won\u2019t say who \u201cthey\u201d are, when he says that sometimes \u201cthey\u201d impose judgements or decisions which the government doesn\u2019t believe supports Australia\u2019s national interest. But he won\u2019t say who \u201cthey\u201d is. It\u2019s just \u201cthey\u201d. Mathias Cormann and Penny Wong are now using Malcolm Roberts\u2019s support as a sledge. Fair. Asking about the prime minister\u2019s Lowy institute speech \u2013 the \u201cnegative globalism\u201d one \u2013 Penny Wong asks for the difference between positive and negative globalism. It doesn\u2019t look like anyone can. The PM&amp;C officials can\u2019t think of any other reference to negative globalism. Mathias Cormann jumps in to say it was a great speech, which was very well received by those who heard it. \u201cOne Nation loved it,\u201d Wong quips back. Cormann says he believes the \u201cquiet Australians\u201d would have received it well. Wong then asks what global organisations demand conformity. There is silence in the room. Cormann is now reading directly from the speech. Penny Wong is asking PM&amp;C officials about \u201cBurnedSpy\u201d (a name she laughs as she says out loud) and whether the department has taken any investigations as a consequence of the claims made in the story (that he regularly posts on conspiracy QAnon conspiracy sites and their partner works on the prime minister\u2019s staff). Mathias Cormann takes everything on notice. I imagine this will be in response to Ken Wyatt\u2019s interview last week, in which he said he would be moving to legislate a voice to parliament, rather than enshrining it in the constitution, in order to get the recognition referendum up (and passed). Indigenous people called for the voice to be enshrined, so it could not be overrun, as Atsic was. For those interested, Bob Katter and Adam Bandt are both in the chamber arguing against the free trade deal - it s not often you see those two on the same side of an argument. Angus Taylor\u2019s disclosures regarding his interest in company Jam Land are now being scrutinised, given the department\u2019s administration of the ministerial standards. Labor senator Jenny McAllister is asking what attempts have been made by the prime minister, Scott Morrison, to satisfy himself that Taylor is not in breach of ministerial standards which prevent the use of public office for personal benefit. Cormann insists that Taylor is not in breach, and has disclosed his interest in Jam Land as required under the rules, and says the targeting of Taylor is \u201csmear and innuendo\u201d. Cormann says that stopping Taylor advocating for landholders in his electorate, including himself, would be like suggesting he should not advocate tax cuts as a beneficiary. Labor senator Penny Wong accuses him of making a \u201cridiculous equivalency\u201d. \u201cHe is not advocating on behalf of his constituency, he is advocating for himself,\u201d Wong said. Labor has picked up on the prime minister\u2019s statement during question time (highlighted below) that I do not believe that those decisions about who should be prosecuted at the end of the day should be made on the whim of politicians. Which contradicts the line that Christian Porter has taken on this \u2013 that he will need to approve any brief from the commonwealth director of public prosecutions (if there is one) before any charges could be moved ahead. Mark Dreyfus says Scott Morrison has confused the issue, asking whether Porter\u2019s directive stands, or not. Mr Morrison\u2019s statement suggests that this government does not know where it stands on freedom of the press and the Australian public\u2019s right to know. A Dfat officer, Philip Green, has sent a message re this morning\u2019s evidence - prompting clarification from Caroline Miller. Miller says that a colleague from Dfat has forwarded an email from 28 May sent to Justin Hayhurst [first assistant secretary to PM&amp;C), CC\u2019d to Miller, which advised that Ambassador Hockey was going to send a letter re the US justice department inquiry into the Mueller report. This was an issue this morning, because Penny Wong wanted to know when PM&amp;C were aware that Australia would be co-operating with the investigation, because of Alexander Downer\u2019s involvement. \u201cWe had forgotten about this message\u201d, says Miller. Zali Steggall will officially present the largest ever parliamentary e-petition (there have been bigger hardcopy ones presented, including one to stop a beer tax) calling on the parliament to declare a climate emergency, in the chamber tomorrow. There were over 400,000 signatures on that one, which is no mean feat. But for it to pass, a few government MPs would need to cross over. Steggall tells Patricia Karvelas \u201cwe are writing around to request a conscience vote\u201d. We are a democracy,\u201d she says. PK points out that the conservative government in the UK passed a climate emergency declaration, so she asks whether she thinks anyone from the conservative side of politics would support it, if a conscience vote was allowed (which it most likely will not be). Absolutely. A lot called for a climate act to be introduced in the UK. It needs to be done, it has to be done and we need to find the political will in Australia. You need more than just lip service at an election, saying that you do believe in climate change and you will take action. We needed to be for more than just inside the party room, it needs to be outside. Everyone should be able to have a conscience vote in parliament and declare whether or not this is an issue we need to address. Back in environment estimates, Labor has been asking about the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, which received a controversial $443.3 m six-year grant from the government. At the time the grant was awarded, it was said the foundation had \u201cunique\u201d capacity to attract further donations for reef projects from the private sector. Senator Nita Green notes the department\u2019s annual report says there is an investment target of between $300m to $400m. \u201cHow many funds have actually been raised?\u201d she asks. Deb Callister, from the department\u2019s heritage, reef and marine division, says: \u201cTo date, the amount that we\u2019ve been advised of is that they\u2019ve raised more than $21m as in-kind contributions from their projects.\u201d Asked what in-kind means, she says it refers to additional provided by organisations and groups that had received funding from the foundation via the grant. This could be staff provided for projects, office space, or cash. Callister says the federal election had affected the foundation\u2019s ability to \u201cparticipate more actively in the fundraising sphere\u201d. Labor warned the foundation before the election it would terminate the grant if it was elected. \u201cIt would come as no surprise to senators that some of the uncertainty around the future of the partnership that arose around the election...has impacted on their (the foundation\u2019s) ability to participate more actively in the fundraising sphere,\u201d Callister says. \u201cBut now that that outcome is known and their future is known they\u2019re moving more actively to engage with potential donors.\u201d Callister says in the first year of the grant the foundation spent \u201cin the vicinity\u201d of $25m on projects and just under $8m on administrative costs. She said the foundation anticipated they would spend $58m on projects in 19-20. Labor is now asking about how the prime minister\u2019s office treats journalists, highlighting messages sent from the PMO to journalist Peter van Onselen that criticised coverage. Labor senator Tim Ayres has asked whether the department believes the correspondence from the PMO shows \u201cprofessional courtesy\u201d in how it deals with journalists, as is required under standards for staffers. After finance minister Mathias Cormann defended the private exchange, Ayres said \u201cno wonder the government wants to lock up journalists\u201d. This sparks an angry response from Cormann, who accuses the senator of conflating in a \u201cdangerous and inappropriate\u201d way the issue of communication between staffers and journalists, and the AFP investigation into national security breaches. Seems to be a lot of incorrect responses flying around Else Kennedy, who is doing an internship with the Guardian, listened to Sydney radio 2GB to hear Ben Fordham\u2019s response to Anne Davies\u2019 story this morning: \u201cMy eyes started glazing over halfway through the piece.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ve ripped into me for the role I played in organising for politicians to have a fresh look at the situation.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not a minister, I\u2019m not a premier, I\u2019m just a radio host. All I did was appeal to those in charge to get out of their air-conditioned offices, go to the parts of the bush ravaged by drought and ask themselves the question, \u2018Is this fair? Is it fair to threaten people with daily fines of $13,000 for not talking to a bureaucrat? Is it fair to bankrupt families that have been putting food on our plates for generations? Is it fair to push men and women to breaking point and whack them over the edge? We\u2019ve already got farmers killing themselves, and I\u2019ve had them talking to me with tears in their eyes. All I did was suggest meetings and ask for a fresh look. It was the NSW government that decided that the land-clearing laws were unfair. The government introduced a new policy. It wasn\u2019t me, it wasn\u2019t this radio station.\u201d \u201cBy all means have a go at me, you can do your best.\u201d \u201cWhat I would say to the Guardian is this: you know that those farmers were in strife. You know that the worst offenders are still being prosecuted. Others have received a reprieve from the strict land-clearing laws and rules have now been changed to make them fairer. \u201cBut understand when there\u2019s a battle between the greenies in the big smoke and the farmers in the bush I\u2019ll be backing the farmers, and any criticism I get for that I wear as a badge of honour. I\u2019ll be campaigning for anyone who deserves our support and I won\u2019t be changing my approach one single bit.\u201d That moment when you realise just how many titles you have. The no props in question time rule going very well Best angles The parliament smells of rich mahogany The answer to this question is no. Acting Greens leader Adam Bandt (Richard Di Natale had to have unscheduled knee surgery, we understand) wants to try and delay the free trade agreement implementation. Liberal and Labor have done a dirty deal to fast-track laws that will give corporations more rights than governments or workers. These dodgy deals allow corporations to boost their profits by suing governments who do things like lift the minimum wage or pass laws to protect the environment. Labor\u2019s \u2018big win\u2019 appears to be an unenforceable side-letter from the Liberals that existing loopholes will continue to apply. The Greens stand with the workers and civil society groups who want these agreements rewritten so that basic rights are protected. We will move amendments to the bills to ensure jobs are advertised locally, corporations can\u2019t sue our government and the Hong Kong deal is delayed while the conflict there continues.\u201d Given Labor and the government are on the same side on this, this will fail. Jacqui Lambie tried her luck with home affairs and border force to question them about Crown again. Mike Pezzullo cautions Lambie on her use of the term \u201cevidence\u201d. \u201cThe department issues visas, and visas are not issued any way other than the Migration Act, so the suggestion that people come uncredentialed is wrong. The ABF checks credentials at the other end and then on arrival.\u201d Lambie says that sounds like some people are coming in with visas on Crown planes. She asks if ABF is \u201cgoing on every one of them with your boots on to check every one of them?\u201d \u201cI hung up my boots a long time ago,\u201d says Pezzullo, referring it to Outram. Outram says, yes, we clear everyone \u2013 passengers and crew \u2013 who comes in on a plane from overseas. Lambie keeps pushing because \u201csomething\u2019s wrong here\u201d. Outram disagrees and says he\u2019s not aware of any corporate entity bringing people to Australia illegally. Over at the Home Affairs estimates, senator Rex Patrick is asking about the department about their not-great record on FOIs. The department had 14,463 in 201718, and it increased by about 4,000 in 2018/19. The department is on track to receive about 21,500 FOI requests this year. Pezzullo says he had an obligation to prioritise risk in particular areas, and said he would have to take resources away from frontline operations, like counterterrorism and interference. He said he has tried to take out the red tape and \u201cget more productivity\u201d out of the FOI officers, which he agreed was likely to go up. \u201cBeyond that until I\u2019m convinced otherwise that there is a requirement because of faulty decision-making or more persistent overturns at review, that that area is performing very well \u2026 and I\u2019m not looking to shift significant resources into that area because they\u2019ll have to come from frontline operations.\u201d Recent coverage from Chris Knaus: Here are some more FOI stats from the Home Affairs annual report. In 2018\u201319 the Department received 18,412 Freedom of Information (FOI) requests, including 623 amendment requests, compared with 14,683 requests in 2017\u201318, representing a 25.4% increase. Of the 18,412 FOI requests received in 2018\u201319, 16,876 were for personal information and 917 for non-personal information (619 uncategorised). The Department finalised 17,078 FOI requests. Of these 16,464 were access requests and 614 were amendment requests. Of the 16,464 access requests: \u2022 9,401 cases were granted full access \u2022 5,375 cases were granted part access \u2022 902 cases were refused access33 \u2022 786 cases were invalid, transferred to other agencies, or saw applicants withdraw their requests before a decision on access was made. The department\u2019s FOI compliance rate (requests finalised within statutory timeframes) for 2018\u221219 was 75%. At 30 June 2018, the Department had 1081 overdue requests on hand. Infrastructure officials have confirmed in Senate estimates that of the projects that form part of the $4bn 10-year urban congestion fund program none \u2013 NONE \u2013 have started construction. $3bn of that spending is over the next four years, and it\u2019s an impressive list of projects, but all of them are still at the earlier stages of planning, seeking approvals, conducting tenders for contractors etc. No digging, no hi-vis. Labor\u2019s Murray Watt wants to know which projects are going to start before Christmas \u2013 a commitment made by cities and urban infrastructure minister Alan Tudge \u2013 and wants precise delivery dates. Officials suggest that perhaps Tudge was referring to the preliminary steps (rather than the digging). Watt has also drilled down to the micro level \u2013 including a $1m spend on a pedestrian traffic light in Doncaster. Officials suggest it will help \u201cmanage pedestrian flow\u201d and there is also a safety element, because it\u2019s near an aged care facility. Now he\u2019s moved on to the $500m commuter carpark fund. Officials describe the choice of 32 car park projects as a \u201cdecision of government\u201d based on departmental advice about need and priorities. No construction has started on the carparks. Watt\u2019s questions have prompted a flurry of post-it notes from officials sitting behind the front-rowers to help provide answers: One of the carparks in Hurstbridge (Vic) is out to tender which will be awarded in November and be constructed \u201cquite quickly\u201d. Cragieburn (Vic) will go out to tender soon. There\u2019s another in Mandurah, WA out to tender; and Two in NSW where property acquisition is underway. Scott Morrison adds to the answer to Warren Snowdon\u2019s question: On 13 September of this year, I can confirm that the tender was awarded to Australian company Oricon, an engineering company that will lead the Kakadu road strategy, and they\u2019ll work in a consortium with PwC, and PwC Indigenous consulting, beginning the work immediately. The roads of strategy will be developed in conjunction with the tourism master plan, access to key sites and planned upgrades. I thought the member would be interested in that additional information. And we are done. 11 more question times left in the year. The folders are stacked. We are done as soon as Greg Hunt finishes this dixer. Warren Snowdon to Scott Morrison: I ask the prime minister how does the government expect to unlock the full potential of Kakadu national park when it\u2019s pushed back the start date for the upgrade of roads in the Kakadu national park to beyond the next federal election. Sussan Ley takes it: I thank the member for his question, and I find it quite extraordinary that he should be suggesting that $216 million committed by the prime minister and this side of politics for the upgrade in Kakadu national park is somehow insufficient. We know what happens when you roll out an infrastructure program too quickly because it we saw it in government with Labor time after time. We know what happens when you shovel the money out the door \u2013 no policies, guidelines or procurement. $216 million has been dedicated to the upgrade. I was there recently. The traditionally owners are very happy with the process, the tourism initiatives that are starting \u2013 they\u2019re very happy with the process. We have good relationships with the Northern Territory government. We\u2019re not playing politics about this. How could you come into this place and talk this sort of nonsense? Honestly, Mr Speaker. Damian Drum has a dixer for David Littleproud. He stumbles getting through the long list of junior ministries Littleproud holds. \u201cWhy do you have so many titles,\u201d Ed Husic calls out, which makes even Littleproud smile. Still doesn\u2019t make up for losing the one he really wanted though \u2013 agriculture \u2013 to deputy leader Bridget McKenzie. Anthony Albanese to Michael McCormack: Can he confirm that the gap between what the government promised on budget night and what they\u2019ve actually spent on infrastructure is on blackspots, $123m, heavy vehicle safety program, $134m, bridges renewal, $154m, cattle supply, 96, northern Australia roads, $266m, western Sydney infrastructure, $915m, major road projects $2.8bn and asset recycling initiatives $1.5m. McCormack is talking, but for some reason, all I can think about is over-boiled cauliflower. Melissa Price just told Anthony Albanese he was \u201cvery rude\u201d. This is where we are. Alicia Payne to Scott Morrison: Since coming to office the government has spent a total of $5bn less on infrastructure than it promised including $123m less than it promised on blackspots. Why? Morrison: Mr Speaker, as members opposite would know, the program and schedule of projects, which the government pursues, one that is put together in partnership with the states and territories as we seek to implement that plan. And, Mr Speaker, and indeed whether it\u2019s with local government even on projects that we pursue, our job is to ensure that we provide the allocation of the funds and to set the priority projects and to sit down with the state and territory governments. Now those opposite would know, and in particular the leader of the opposition would know, from his time when he served as a minister for infrastructure, that the scheduling of projects is set out together with the states and territories and the profile for the delivery of those projects is often revised based on the advice provided by those states and territories. And that is why the changes in the schedule arrive as they have. I\u2019d make this point, though. Under our government, this year we will spend around $10bn on infrastructure. That is what is budged to be spent in this very financial year. All around the country. Now, Mr Speaker, that\u2019s almost double, almost double, what we inherited from the Labor party when we came to government and the leader of the opposition, who sits at the table now, I think from memory, and I\u2019ll be happy to stand corrected on this figure, but I understand the figure at that time was around $6bn. And so this year we\u2019re spending $10bn or thereabouts just slightly less than that, and the reason we\u2019re doing that is because two budgets ago we decided to put in place the $75bn pipeline of projects over 10 years, and in the last budget, recognising the difficult situation that we\u2019re facing in the global economy, we increased that pipeline of investments over the next 10 years $100bn. We upped it, Mr Speaker, because we knew that\u2019s what the Australian economy would need just not now but over the next 10 years and, more importantly than that, we have the budget discipline and the budget to back those sorts of commitments up. So, Mr Speaker, the reason for any change in schedules is not because of the lack of fiscal capacity or discipline because of this government but because of any changes to scheduling that is done in relation to our negotiations with the states and territories. Well, I know from those opposite when they\u2019re in government the reason they cut defence spending the reason they don\u2019t list pharmaceuticals, the reason they have to [insert] flood levies and all these things is because they never know how to manage money. Australians knew they could trust this government to deliver and manage money. Again, the last time Labor was in government, there was the GFC. (No) right to know While question time rolls on, officials from the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet are declining to answer a bunch of questions. They won\u2019t say whether Brian Houston appeared on a list of possible guests to attend the state dinner in Washington supplied by the PMO on the basis that might prejudice international relations. (No I\u2019m not joking). They won\u2019t answer questions about Alexander Downer on the same basis. Officials from PMC also said they don\u2019t know who Scott Morrison told Donald Trump was the primary point of contact for the Barr inquiry, even though Trump made a special call to Morrison to ask for that point of contact. An official from PMC tells the hearing he got a short read-out of the call between Morrison and Trump from a member of Morrison\u2019s staff afterwards, but the read-out was verbal and he didn\u2019t take notes, (so there\u2019s no paper trail to FOI.) He says the Department of Foreign Affairs is the lead agency. Finance minister Mathias Cormann says the first point of contact is our \u201coutstanding and distinguished\u201d ambassador to Washington, Joe Hockey. Milton Dick to Scott Morrison: Can the prime minister confirm for every $100 of the roads of strategic fund only 50 cents will be spent in Queensland this year. Michael McCormack is given the nod, meaning Milton Dick is on my list. We are getting on with funding, funding, roads of strategic importance. And projects in Queensland. And I have asked Mark Bailey, the minister responsible to bring forward projects. We\u2019re getting on with making sure that we build the roads, build the ports, and do everything that we need to do as a government to build a better Queensland. We\u2019re getting on with the job of making sure that if it comes to Queensland or indeed any state or territory that we\u2019re building roads of strategic importance. Those opposite wouldn\u2019t ever have funded a program such as the roads of strategic importance because they never, ever worried about a regional program unless they could rort it. And speaking of the chief rorter here she is. That\u2019s Catherine King he is referring to, as she is at the despatch box. She asks for the comment to be withdrawn. \u201cHow do you know he was talking about you,\u201d says a government minister, proving just how much attention they are paying to McCormack. Because he said it as she was at the despatch box, genius. McCormack withdraws, but he is still speaking, and now he is talking about truck drivers and whether or not people have been in them lately and just saying \u201cstrategic importance\u201d randomly, like he has just discovered the phrase. The government is supporting \u201chardworking businesses\u201d. So all you slackarse businesses take note. Anthony Albanese is trying to have a dixer to Angus Taylor ruled out of order, because it referred to \u201cemissions reductions\u201d and emissions are going up. Taylor: We haven\u2019t just turned around the financial deficit, we have turned around their abatement deficit. Every moment I refrain from running from the chamber rampaging is a victory. \u201cWe are getting on with planning,\u201d Michael McCormack says. Bookmark that as an election slogan. And to think he actually used to work with words for a living. Kate Thwaites to Scott Morrison: Can the prime minister confirm that none of the eight Victorian projects listed under the roads of strategic importance fund has even reached the planning stage? Morrison: We have a timeline and we are working on it with the premier of Victoria (That\u2019s a paraphrasing because I have lost the will to live) The opposition may want to engage in the theatre of politics on these matters, but the premier of Victoria and I are engaging in the business of delivery of infrastructure projects in Victoria. Oh dear JLo. Now Michael McCormack is at the despatch box. He is talking about pipelines and I am willing my cells to start collapsing in on themselves because it would be less painful. Josh Frydenberg just took a lickspittle which is only helping to prove while the entire question time process in Australia needs to be scrapped, and started again. #deathtodixers Catherine King to Scott Morrison: Why did the government spend nearly $17m on taxpayer-funded congestion funding advertising in the lead-up to this year\u2019s election but did not spend a single cent from the urban congestion fund the whole of the last financial year? Alan Tudge takes it \u2013 and that\u2019s enough for me to become exceptionally fascinated with my cuticles. Jason Falinski asks Josh Frydenberg a dixer about his trip to the IMF meeting. We hear about how important it is (I guess it is an example of positive globalisation) so at the end of the answer, Jim Chalmers asks to table a transcript where Falinski described the IMF as a \u201cleftwing organisation\u201d. Permission is not granted. Zali Steggall has the independent\u2019s question: Foodbank is the large provider of food and groceries to food relief charities around Australia. These charities provide relief to over 815,000 Australians each month including people in my electorate and farmers affected by the drought. 252 tonnes of food and groceries were shipped out of the New South Wales warehouse, alone, 110 tonnes went to regional and remote areas in New South Wales yet foodbank is not receiving any emergency funding to meet the demand. Will the government increase funding and support food support strategy as part of Australia\u2019s response to climate change? Scott Morrison: I thank the member for her question and I will ask the minister representing the minister for social services to respond further to the member\u2019s question. The government does provide support to Foodbank. We do to many Foodbank services around the country. And we are pleased to do so because we acknowledge the tremendous work that they do. As we continue to work particularly in response as part of our drought program, we are working with a whole host of different charitable organisation. We have provided over $50m in fact to organisations like the Salvos and Vinnies and others, the Country Women\u2019s Association, in ensuring we\u2019re providing the support where we can. I\u2019ll ask the minister for - representing the for social services to add further. Paul Fletcher: I do thank the member for her question and the prime minister for the opportunity to add some further information in relation to the support that the government provides for food banks. $750,000 a year in funding over a 4.5-year period. That of course is not the only food relief program that the commonwealth government, Morrison government supports. We also provide funding for two other significant charities in this area, Second Bite and OzHarvest. These are all important measures designed to provide support to needy Australians, to vulnerable Australians, and of course we continue to work with these important agencies for the delivery of this funding. And continue to work with them and a whole range of other agencies to support Australians affected by drought. Jim Chalmers to Scott Morrison: When the Reserve Bank, the IMF, the Business Council of Australia, AI group, Master Builders and others have all call for action by the government to support the economy, why is the government refusing to consider a proportionate, measured and responsible stimulus program to boost the economy by bringing forward infrastructure investment? Morrison: The government\u2019s budget contains some almost $10bn of infrastructure in this financial year, Mr Speaker. That\u2019s monies that is hitting right cross the country. In addition to that, Mr Speaker, the tax cuts that were legislated by this country, fought against by the Labor party, who said these shouldn\u2019t happen and in fact the Labor party argued at the election that we should be imposing $387bn of higher taxes. Higher taxes on the Australian economy. I don\u2019t know what sort of a stimulus package $387bn of higher taxes constitutes, but that was the description that was ... member for Lyons. That was offered by the shadow treasurer when he was the shadow finance minister and he was the joint architect, Mr Speaker, with the former shadow treasurer and the former leader of the opposition who said they thought at this time of great uncertainty in the global economy that adding $387bn to the tax burden of Australians would be a good idea. Now, we don\u2019t share that view, Mr Speaker. We believe and we have demonstrated in our budget that the right way to go about addressing the issue in the global economy, indeed in the domestic economy is the stable and considered approach of rolling out our program of reducing the costs of doing business, whether it\u2019s on removing unnecessary regulation, ensuring that we\u2019re training people for the skills needs of the future, delivering tax relief to Australians, taking further out, Mr Speaker, our trade barriers to ensure that we\u2019re dealing with in more and more countries in the world, taking our trade agreements coverage from 26% to 70%, and we\u2019re seeking to go further. So, that is the economic plan that we took to the election. The Labor party would have us engage in the reckless spending policies that they last implemented when the member ... who asked the question ... the member for Rankin, and instituted one of the most reckless, reckless spending packages which crashed the budget and took money away from things like pharmaceuticals, defence spending and a whole range of other important priorities \u2018cause the Labor party did not know how to manage money. Now, he refers to the governor of the Reserve Bank and I\u2019m happy to quote him. \u2018The Australian economy\u2019, on 1 October, \u2018Appears to have reached a turning point. The economy has been through a soft patch recently but we are expecting a return to around trend growth over the next year. There are a number of factors that are supporting this outlook. These include the low level of interest rates, the recent tax cuts, ongoing spending on infrastructure, signs of stabilise identification in established housing markets.\u2019 Just your standard reminder that the GFC happened when Labor was in power. The department of agriculture has put out this statement, after the footage of horses being mistreated was shown on the ABC\u2019s 7.30 The regulation of animal welfare remains the responsibility of the states and territories. The Department of Agriculture\u2019s role is limited to export abattoirs where it works to ensure Australian export standards are met. Consistent with the department\u2019s responsibilities, we are conducting a critical incident audit of the facility at the centre of recent footage depicting the mistreatment of horses. Queensland authorities are working closely with the department on this audit. A preliminary report will be produced early this week. The department will then determine any regulatory action to be taken. The department understands that Queensland has requested the original footage from the ABC, which will assist in determining a number of important factors, such as when the incidents took place. The department urges anyone with evidence or concerns about animal welfare to immediately report it to the relevant state jurisdiction. In environment estimates Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young is asking about the statutory review of Australia\u2019s environment laws (the EPBC Act) that is due to commence this month. The department confirms it will begin in the next 10 days but doesn\u2019t have a date. A terms of reference has been drafted that will be released when the review is announced. They can\u2019t tell the hearing who will be leading the review. \u201cIt will commence within the next 10 days,\u201d the department\u2019s deputy secretary Dean Knudson says. \u201cThe last review took about a year. I expect this will be of a similar length.\u201d Officials say a department team of 13.4 full-time equivalent staff has been set up for the review. Just on Scott Morrison\u2019s answer just before: If we get to the point where the leader of the opposition wants to arbitrarily, outside the law ... decide who gets prosecuted and who doesn\u2019t, Mr Speaker, then that\u2019s not a country that I think Australians would want to live in. That is pretty much what the attorney general does. He will look at the brief that is put forward by the commonwealth director of public prosecutions and then decide if the commonwealth pursues it. That\u2019s a pretty big part of the nation\u2019s first law officer\u2019s job. Someone has subjected us to Michael McCormack at the despatch box, and it\u2019s as substantial as watching rice boil over. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: (referring to the Right to Know campaign) Does the prime minister agree that journalism is not a crime? Morrison: I agree that journalism is not a crime. But I agree also, and I wonder if the leader of the opposition agrees, that if people \u2013 whatever profession they\u2019re in, whether they\u2019re politicians, whether they\u2019re journalists, whether they\u2019re anyone, Mr Speaker, a public officials, there is no one in this country who is above the law. People should not be prosecuted for their profession. They should only be prosecuted if indeed they have been found to be falling foul of the law, Mr Speaker. And I do not believe that those decisions about who should be prosecuted at the end of the day should be made on the whim of politicians. I think they should be made based on the rule of law, Mr Speaker. Members on my left. And the proper assessment of appropriately constituted law enforcement agencies. And that is why, Mr Speaker ... the government believes absolutely in press freedoms in this country and we have taken steps ... we have taken the step to add additional defences into our laws to ensure that journalists, Mr Speaker, can get about their task. In fact, Mr Speaker, protections that exceed that apply to many others around the country, and those were put in by our government, not those opposite, because I remember when those were in government ... they sought to gag the press right across the country, Mr Speaker. They sought to gag the press in this country with their failed media reforms that wanted to implement a public interest a public interest media advocate to try and stifle the press in this country. Now, Mr Speaker, I am not going to take lectures from a Labor party who sought in this place when they were in government to try and muzzle the press. In stark contrast we provided guidelines from the minister for home affairs to the AFP and other law enforcement agencies about how best to go about their business. And I know the statement from the commissioner of the AFP the work he\u2019s doing to review those matters. But if it comes to a position in this country where prime ministers and politicians decide who gets prosecuted and who doesn\u2019t get prosecuted ... Without taking the appropriate advice and without seeing the appropriate release which are required under legislation. If we get to the point where the leader of the opposition wants to arbitrarily, outside the law ... Decide who gets prosecuted and who doesn\u2019t, Mr Speaker, then that\u2019s not a country that I think Australians would want to live in. Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation director general Mike Burgess is up in Senate estimates. In his opening statement, Burgess described the threat level to Australia from both terrorism and foreign interference as \u201cunprecedented\u201d. He cited the threat of extremist groups in Syria and Iraq encouraging attacks in Australia and added that the threat of extreme rightwing groups \u201ccontinues\u201d and is an important area of focus. It\u2019s interesting he said \u201ccontinues\u201d because the Asio annual report said the rightwing extremist threat has actually \u201cincreased\u201d, but eventually he picks up the script from the report and says the threat is \u201cmore cohesive and organised than they have been in previous years\u201d. Under questioning from Labor\u2019s Kristina Keneally, Burgess said a rightwing extremist terrorist attack is \u201cplausible\u201d, citing a matter in the NSW courts at the moment. He said there was \u201c\u201dno doubt\u201d the horrific Christchurch attack would inspire some individuals. Burgess confirms no rightwing extremist groups are listed as terrorist organisations and says he\u2019s not aware the UK has listed one. \u201cWe are actively [investigating] ... we have subjects of investigation and they are ongoing. We\u2019ve had a mind and eye to this for a number of years now,\u201d he said. Liberal senator Amanda Stoker asks what proportion of Asio\u2019s work is focused on rightwing extremism, leftwing extremism, Islamic extremism and \u201cother\u201d forms of extremism. He takes the question on notice. We have our first reference to \u201cchaos and panic\u201d from Scott Morrison in regards to Labor. It\u2019s all part of this new narrative of why the government is holding on to its surplus, in the face of more and more calls to stimulate the economy. That narrative boils down to this from Scott Morrison: And so they elected a government that they knew would be able to address these very difficult circumstances with stability, with certainty, with measure and do so in a way not afflicted by the politics of crisis or the policies of crisis but with the stable and calm approach that enables them to get on and plan for their future with confidence. And that\u2019s why, Mr Speaker, as a government we are continuing to do that. Whether it is maintaining the discipline in our budget management, which is one of the reasons why \u2013 the big reason why we\u2019ve been able to take what was an absolute fiscal wreckage that was left to us under the Labor party and over the last six years we have painstakingly done the work, getting expenditure under control, making the choices that are necessary to get the budget back into a position that gives this country resilience at a time when it needs it. But because politics is as subtle as Cardi B, Labor is \u201cpanic and chaos\u201d while \u201cstability and certainty is the mark of our government\u201d, a point Morrison hopes to be able to keep making until it catches on. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question is to the prime minister. Will the prime minister convene a cross-party drought cabinet to ensure that representatives from across the parliament work together constructively to respond to the drought emergency in the interests of farmers and rural communities? \u201cGood question, take the politics out of it,\u201d someone in Labor yells. The government benches laugh. Morrison: The government\u2019s drought response over a year ago was based on the multiple sclerosis party, multiple sclerosis organisation drought summit that was convened in the Old Parliament House which the opposition was invited to attend as were all states and territories as was the National Farmers\u2019 Federation, the many different agricultural producer groups, charitable organisation, the Country Women\u2019s Association. Mr Speaker, experts and officials from across government agencies and departments and, Mr Speaker... (INTERJECTIONS) Yes, the drought coordinator was in attendance there ... and he was central to the organisation of that drought summit. All \u2013 there were many members from this House who were present at that summit as well and that summit framed the drought response the government has continued to rollout since that time. And since that time we\u2019ve continued to listen very carefully, particularly through the minister for drought to rural communities across the country to ensure that the response that we are continuing to provide is up to the mark in terms of the needs in rural and regional communities across Australia. I remind the House that that response has three components. The first of those components is to ensure the direct financial support and assistance as is the responsibilities of the commonwealth under the national drought agreement which was revised and updated after that drought summit which made it very clear that it was the commonwealth\u2019s responsibility to look after the income support and other financial assistance to farmhouse holds and those communities, and issues such as fodder subsidies and subsidies and the direct care of animals and others involved in the welfare of the farms themselves. That was the responsibility of the states and territories. So the reforms we have made to Farm Household Allowance alone means with a period of just over four years with the announcement last year that individual households will have received as couples $125,000 in direct financial support. Not alone but direct financial support over and above what they are able to do in terms of earning off farm income which we lifted the threshold up to $100,000 and that enables them even with that off farm income to access the Farm Household Allowance. There was drought to drought affected communities through a community. So it\u2019s not just about farmers and graziers, it\u2019s also about the communities that are infect \u2013 affected and we have invested in over 120 councils and their shire areas to ensure wear supporting the continuation and growth of their economies during difficult times and of course we have invested in water resilience. That\u2019s our plan. We\u2019re getting on with it. We\u2019ll continue to get on with it will being to farming communities. And so does my eye twitch Scott Morrison is in the House and is having a chat with Anthony Albanese which they both seem to be enjoying, given the laughter. We are in the chamber for question time - who is that MP? It\u2019s Susan Templeton, the member for Macquarie. And now it\u2019s John McVeigh, the member for Groom. Penny Wong is now FOIing the documents PM&amp;C received and then sent in regards to the William Barr investigation into the Mueller report, given Alexander Downer\u2019s involvement. Dear FOI Officer RE: FREEDOM OF INFORMATION APPLICATION \u2013 INVESTIGATION INITIATED BY THE UNITED STATES ATTORNEY GENERAL WILLIAM BARR CONCERNING THE FBI\u2019S RUSSIA INVESTIGATION I request the following documents held by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (FOI Act): All documents created, or received, since 1 May 2018 related to the investigation initiated by the United States Attorney General William Barr concerning the FBI\u2019s Russia investigation, including, but not limited to, communications with the United States Government and briefs to the Prime Minister. This request excludes media reports, press releases and duplicate documents. I note that the objects of the FOI Act include giving the Australian community access to information held by government and promoting Australia\u2019s representative democracy by increasing scrutiny, discussion, comment and review of government activities. I expect that as soon as practicable, and no later than 30 days after receiving this request, I will be notified of a decision. Documents should be provided to [redacted] Yours sincerely Senator Penny Wong Also from AAP, an update from that noted climate scientist Pauline Hanson: #notallcorals A defiant Pauline Hanson has maintained coral bleaching is a natural occurrence, in an exchange with the chief scientist of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. The Queenslander used a Senate estimates hearing on Monday to question the link between heatwaves and back-to-back mass coral bleaching events in 2016 and 2017. \u201cYou\u2019re saying that coral bleaching is affected by water temperatures,\u201d she told David Wachenfeld. \u201cYet around Indonesia, closer to the equator ... where the water temperatures are 29C, it\u2019s a known fact that coral actually grows faster and more prolific in warmer temperatures.\u201d Dr Wachenfeld explained that corals live in a variety of water temperatures over the world, with substantial differences even within the Great Barrier Reef. Corals bleach when stressed \u2013 such as when exposed to warmer than normal temperatures \u2013 and die if stressed for prolonged periods, he told the senator. \u201cThe fact that corals in Indonesia could withstand higher temperatures than corals on the central Great Barrier Reef is of no benefit to the corals of the central Great Barrier Reef when they die.\u201d But Senator Hanson was not swayed, asking how the authority planned to address both water temperatures and the \u201cnatural occurrence\u201d of bleaching events with its taxpayer funding. The GBRMPA is trying to stamp out crown-of-thorns starfish, improve water quality in catchments while urging for greater global action on climate change, Senator Hanson was told. The authority recently released its latest five-year outlook for the reef, that found it to be \u201cvery poor\u201d unless more action was taken to slow climate change. From AAP: Taxpayers forked out millions to sell the federal government\u2019s infrastructure promises in the lead-up to the May election, dwarfing spending in the previous year. Infrastructure department officials confirmed more than $13 million was spent on advertising projects in the past financial year. But just $272,000 in taxpayer funds went to similar advertising in 2017-18, while $64,000 was spent in 2016-17. Labor frontbencher Murray Watt asked cabinet minister Bridget McKenzie about the issue during a Senate estimates hearing in Canberra on Monday. \u201cIt spent $11.626 million of taxpayers\u2019 money in the three months leading up to the election \u2013 you got a pretty good return on your investment didn\u2019t you?\u201d he said. Senator McKenzie said the decision was based on market research indicating a low level of community awareness about infrastructure spending. \u201cThis campaign was about informing the Australian public about spending on infrastructure in their local communities,\u201d she said. Senator Watt noted the government spent about 60 times more money on infrastructure spending in an election year than the previous year. \u201cThat\u2019s just a total coincidence?\u201d he asked. Environment officials have answered some questions about the Angus Taylor grasslands saga. Specifically, they were asked about occasions when the former minister Josh Frydenberg or his office sought information about the investigation into alleged illegal land clearing by Jam Land Pty Ltd, which Minister Taylor part owns. Labor\u2019s Katy Gallagher has asked the questions to follow up on this story by Guardian Australia last week. Monica Collins, the department\u2019s chief of compliance, lists some dates in July, August and October 2017. But Gallagher is interested in some earlier requests from the minister\u2019s office in February 2017. As revealed by Guardian last week, an email shows staff were asked to prepare \u201curgent\u201d talking points about the grasslands listing after a compliance case was raised in parliament. But searches by Guardian Australia of Hansard records found no mention of it. Today, Collins confirms the department also went looking for a Hansard record at the time and they, too, found nothing. \u201cI\u2019m not sure where that request came into the office but my recollection of that document is that it was on the basis with a phone call with somebody,\u201d she told the hearing. \u201cI know that staff also searched Hansard and didn\u2019t find a direct mention of it in parliament. Gallagher: \u201cSo they did [a search] on that date? Around the time the request came in, they did a search to see whether it had been mentioned in the parliament?\u201d Collins: \u201cYes that\u2019s right\u201d Gallagher: \u201cAnd, could they find anything?\u201d Collins: No, nothing specific. Nothing specific about Jam Land and grasslands. Collins says the information supplied to Frydenberg\u2019s office was \u201cvery high level\u201d in terms of \u201ca brief update on the investigation, some information about the grasslands listing\u201d and things of that nature. The Greens senator Larissa Waters asks when the department conducted site visits to the Jam Land property near Delegate in NSW and when it first launched proceedings against Jam Land. Collins says she can\u2019t give dates of site visits because the investigation is ongoing, but there have been four site visits. She said the department received the report about alleged illegal clearing in November 2016 and first wrote to Jam Land in December 2016. Waters asked why the investigation has taken nearly three years. Collins says a lot of factors influence this, such as the caseload of individual officers, but \u201cwe\u2019re hoping to conclude it very soon\u201d. The Senate estimate committees are all on a lunch break and the House is on the downhill slide to question time, so it\u2019s a catch your breath moment. The climate emergency motion debate ran out of time \u2013 it will continue tomorrow. Penny Wong says she understands US senator Lindsay Graham wrote to the prime minister on 2 October ... but we go to the scheduled break before we can see if this is a question Mathias Cormann will allow the PM&amp;C officials to answer. Also, a couple of extra bits from the Albanese press conference: he addresses the rumour that Labor MP Mike Kelly might trigger a byelection in his marginal seat of Eden-Monaro, saying Kelly will be here \u201cfor a long time\u201d and is an \u201cimportant member of the team\u201d. He says the only way that the government will be able to claw back the seat will be to beat him in an election. Albanese is also asked about the Right to Know campaign, saying he agrees on the importance of a free press and commenting that it is \u201cunacceptable\u201d that journalists should be facing criminal prosecution. The Labor leader is also asked why only five MPs were in the chamber when the opposition introduced its climate emergency motion, saying that was \u201cwhat happened in parliament\u201d and it was no reflection of the importance of motions or legislation. Back in estimates, Penny Wong says she is just trying to work out how Australia went from \u201cwe\u2019ll co-operate if asked\u201d, which is what Marise Payne said, to Joe Hockey proactively sending a letter saying we would help. This is all taken on notice. \u201cThis is the most interventionist you\u2019ve ever been,\u201d Wong says. \u201c... I\u2019m quite relaxed, actually,\u201d Cormann says a little later. Labor will vote in support of three new free trade agreements after securing a range of concessions from the government on labour market testing, worker exploitation, and outdated agreements regarding investor legal rights. Labor leader Anthony Albanese and shadow trade minister Madeleine King have held a press conference confirming their support for enabling legislation tabled last week, saying the agreements with Indonesia, Hong Kong and Peru would be good for Australian jobs, business and the national economy. Albanese said that, had Labor been in government, it would have made a different agreement with Indonesia that would have better dealt with labour market testing and would have excluded investor state dispute settlement clauses. \u201cThis is not an agreement that Labor would have made, we would have made different provisions,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cBut it is an agreement the government has put forward, and one in which, overall, provides benefits for Australian workers, Australian jobs and for our national economy, which is why Labor will be supporting these three agreements.\u201d As part of its negotiations, Labor has secured from the government a commitment to bring forward criminal penalties for the worst forms of worker exploitation, which Albanese said would now occur as a \u201cmatter of urgency\u201d. The trade minister, Simon Birmingham, has assured the opposition that the government will seek to terminate a bilateral investment treaty signed between Indonesia and Australia, including \u201csurvival clauses\u201d, but this will require Indonesian agreement. Albanese said that he believed this was a \u201cmatter of courtesy\u201d, but he was confident that the old agreement would be scrapped. The argument is now dissolving into who is speaking over who. When did the PM&amp;C officials become aware of our assistance with the Barr inquiry? Mathias Cormann attempts to stop this one as well. Eventually we get to someone saying it is being dealt with by foreign affairs and trade and has no involvement from PM&amp;C. But when did they first become aware, Wong asks Caroline Miller, who heads up the PM&amp;C international division, once again. Cormann again stops the answer. I swear to JLo, this is like watching a report being redacted in real time. \u201cAre you aware now,\u201d Wong asks again. \u201cThat\u2019s a very funny question,\u201d Cormann says. While this sideshow is happening in PM&amp;C estimates, Michaelia Cash has shown up in the home affairs estimates hearing. \u201cIf it was business as usual, surely you wouldn\u2019t be worried about answering questions,\u201d Penny Wong asks. \u201cI\u2019m not worried,\u201d Mathias Cormann says. And around and around we go. \u201cThe front page of the papers is looking very accurate,\u201d Penny Wong says, after around 1,000,000 of back and forth between her and Mathias Cormann about when officials in the prime minister\u2019s department knew it was the government\u2019s position to assist with the US justice department inquiry into the Mueller investigation and Alexander Downer\u2019s role in it. Labor\u2019s Murray Watt has asked infrastructure and regional development department officials whether they have read any of Barnaby Joyce\u2019s texts about the drought. Answer: no. Agriculture minister Bridget McKenzie offers a lot of generalities about what Joyce delivered \u2013 including \u201ca lot of correspondence about how we can better help drought affected communities\u201d. He offered a \u201crange of advice\u201d which \u201cinforms our ongoing response\u201d to the drought. Watt then takes up the attack about the eligibility of councils for drought assistance funding. Officials revealed that Moira shire failed because only 16.9% of its workforce is in agriculture, fisheries or forestry and the cutoff is 17%. Watt suggests that, likewise, Singleton, Kiama, Shoalhaven, Eurobadalla and Yass are \u201call badly drought-affected but not eligible\u201d because of the workforce threshold. Departmental officials take on notice how far they fell short. Officials also revealed the government made an election commitment to provide drought funding to 14 councils and the department did not apply the same criteria because it was a \u201cdecision of government\u201d to commit funding. Watt criticises the decision to \u201chand out money during an election\u201d while \u201cpoor old Moira shire missed out\u201d. Officials take on notice whether any of the 14 councils would have failed the eligibility test, if it were applied. McKenzie said the decision was based on ABS and Bureau of Meteorology data, but can\u2019t say whether they met the criteria. Penny Wong is trying for the fourth or fifth time to find out if anyone within the prime minister\u2019s department knew of the US justice department announcement, given Alexander Downer\u2019s involvement. It has now been taken on notice by Mathias Cormann, to stop Wong from asking any of the officials about it. But apparently the senior PM and C international division officials were unaware of Joe Hockey\u2019s letter agreeing to assist with the investigation, before it was sent. Cormann again says it would be remarkable if we didn\u2019t agree to assist, as is normal practice. \u201cThere is actually nothing remarkable in this, it would be very strange if Mr Hockey, representing the Australian government, had said anything else,\u201d Cormann says. Cormann wants these questions to go to foreign affairs and trade. Was the government informed about the investigation before it was publicly announced, Penny Wong wants to know? Mathias Cormann says the Australian government \u201cof course\u201d seeks to co-operate with official investigations and it would be remarkable if Australia did not agree to co-operate. He says there is only so much he can talk about. But he doesn\u2019t answer the question. Penny Wong is now moving on to the investigation the US justice department has ordered into how the Mueller inquiry came about \u2013 you may remember that Alexander Downer is wrapped up in that. Penny Wong says Mathias Cormann is attempting to make assertions about what is in \u201cmy mind and heart\u201d about the motives in her questions (about what Australia thinks is the risk of Da\u2019esh coming back). Cormann says the imputations were clear. Wong says she just wants answers. \u201cI am actually just asking about consequences ... about the current situation in northern Syria,\u201d she says. Cormann can\u2019t let go of what he thinks the imputations. Now Jacqui Lambie is pissed with how it\u2019s all going, and she just wants to know if there is a risk assessment \u2013 telling Cormann the problem is \u201cyou have no plan\u201d. \u201cThe Australian public would like to know,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have nothing on paper ... there are a lot of unanswered questions here.\u201d Wong lets her go. Lambie says given Cormann and Scott Morrison said Donald Trump\u2019s actions didn\u2019t come as a surprise, since Trump had spoken about it in the past, what conversations did Australia have about protecting Australian troops, given there was a risk of the US withdrawing its own troops. \u201cWhen did you actually open up dialogue about this \u2013 was it just the day [he announced it]?\u201d Cormann just says Australia has a good relationship with the US, and we have \u201congoing and consistent\u201d dialogue with the US. Lambie still wants to know when Australia first discussed this with the US. \u201cWe have answered this question,\u201d Cormann says. Which means, based on these answers, the first conversation was after Trump publicly announced the withdrawal. \u201cSo in other words, Australia had no idea, and Trump just walked over the top of them and you just went, \u2018that\u2019s it, we can\u2019t do anything\u2019, because you left your run too late,\u201d Lambie says. Cormann disputes this, but we still don\u2019t get any answers. Another 10 minutes have passed and we still don\u2019t have any more idea of whether the Australian government has made any sort of risk assessment over whether there is likely to be a re-emergence or strengthening of the Da\u2019esh terror group, given the Syria situation. Amnesty Australia has responded to the AFP\u2019s apology to Hakeem al-Araibi: An apology, albeit belated, is the very least Hakeem should expect for the ordeal he and his family endured,\u201d Amnesty International Australia campaigner Tim O\u2019Connor said. It\u2019s a welcome acknowledgement of systemic failure in the AFP and Department of Home Affairs processes. We look forward to the Department of Home Affairs also offering an apology to Hakeem and his family. The evidence we have garnered through Freedom of Information clearly shows it is the failure of Home Affairs systems and communications that led to Hakeem\u2019s detention in Thailand. It is troubling that more than 10 months after these Australian government departments failed Hakeem, that their systems are still not fixed. What happened to Hakeem could happen to someone else, which is why Australian taxpayers should receive an independent and transparent inquiry so we can all have trust in our government\u2019s systems. In rural and regional affairs, infrastructure department officials have revealed just 430 public service jobs have been decentralised from the ACT, central Sydney and central Melbourne. Labor\u2019s Murray Watt makes Bridget McKenzie read out the whole list, making wise cracks about the fact that Adelaide, Brisbane and Parramatta are hardly regional centres. Watt also wants more detail about which jobs are due to move or have moved already. Some 239 jobs moved in 2018 including: The Unique Student Identifier Registrar moved 40 positions from Canberra to Adelaide The office of the Registrar of Indigenous Corporations moved 10 from Canberra to Darwin The Indigenous Affairs group in PMC moved 32 jobs, including 25 from the Sydney CBD to Parramatta The office of the Rural Health Commissioner moved 4 new positions to Adelaide. The infrastructure department moved 12 including 3 to Perth and 9 in the Inland Rail division Australian Maritime Safety Authority \u2013 moved \u201cup to 69 new positions\u201d Australian Law Reform Commission \u2013 12 positions from Sydney to Brisbane. Aboriginal Hostels Limited moved 40 new positions The Australian space agency will move 20 from Canberra to Adelaide. And another 191 jobs moved in 2019, including: The regional programs branch of the infrastructure department is moving from Canberra to Orange The Australian Financial Security Authority moved 15 positions to Hobart, Perth and Brisbane Comcare will relocate some positions and establish offices in Darwin and Launceston The National Indigenous Australians Agency moved 35 from Canberra to Alice Springs, Coffs Harbour and Broome. The Murray Darling Basin Authority moved 76 to Albury, Wodonga, Grififth, Mildura, Murray Bridge and Goondiwindi. Labor\u2019s Glenn Sterle has asked about suggestions up to 1,700 jobs would be moved. McKenzie and departmental officials suggest the bigger number reflects jobs moved before the April 2017 launch of the decentralisation agenda and an ongoing commitment. The precise breakdown has been taken on notice. \u201cThese are the front pages today, the front pages today, and you won\u2019t even answer a question about whether or not there was a note taker,\u201d Penny Wong says, holding up the Adelaide Advertiser front page. \u201cOh the cameras are going, you\u2019ve got them all lined up,\u201d Mathias Cormann says. I mean first of all, no, we are all able to work out that Wong and Cormann in estimates will lead to an argument, because this is not our first time at the rodeo. It\u2019s not even our second. And secondly, this whole place is a theatre. It\u2019s how it works. Anthony Albanese has just called a press conference in the next five minutes. It\u2019s Penny Wong v Mathias Cormann in Senate estimates. They both seem happy to be back on familiar ground. Ten minutes into the hearing, Cormann is talking over Wong, Wong is telling him why she believes he is wrong, and James Paterson is trying his best to keep order. Wong is trying to find out about how Australia found out about the Syria US troop withdrawal (through the public announcement) and whether in follow-up phone calls between Australian and US officials, notes were taken. Sarah Martin is listening for you, and will have more for you soon. As far as Reece Kershaw knows, the AFP is not planning any more raids on journalists, he tells the Labor senator Raff Ciccone. \u201cBut it\u2019s something that we\u2019d obviously be having a look at.\u201d Penny Wong has just entered Senate estimates for the first time. She is in the finance and public administration committee, to question the prime minister\u2019s department. From AAP: Australia\u2019s new top cop has personally apologised to refugee footballer Hakeem al-Araibi for the months he spent behind bars in Thailand. Al-Araibi, a permanent Australian resident, was locked up in Bangkok after Bahraini officials pursued him over vandalism charges. Australian federal police commissioner Reece Kershaw, who has been in the job 19 days, acknowledged a trail of bureaucratic bungles led to his detention. Kershaw said he was now working with the Department of Home Affairs to address a \u201clack of connectivity\u201d between border security systems and the Interpol database. \u201cI have delivered a letter to Mr al-Araibi to extend AFP\u2019s apology for his unfortunate detention in Thailand,\u201d he told a Senate committee in Canberra on Monday. \u201cAnd to reassure Mr al-Araibi that the AFP is continuing to review and improve processes in consultation with other relevant agencies to ensure we respond appropriate to these matters in the future. \u201cThe AFP is working closely with the department to resolve the overarching policy and legal questions arising from this matter.\u201d The chamber is still debating Mark Butler\u2019s motion to declare a climate emergency. There is an inevitable end to this \u2013 the government does not support it, so it won\u2019t pass. Pauline Hanson has made an appearance at the estimates committee grilling the AFP. She wants to know about pill testing. Hanson asks the police commissioner whether pill testing is encouraging the drug trade in Australia. The commissioner says he doesn\u2019t believe organised criminal syndicates would be influenced by whether pill testing exists or doesn\u2019t. \u201cIt\u2019s a global business,\u201d the commissioner says, of the drug trade. Pill testing isn\u2019t relevant. The Greens have just spent a good 10 minutes or so asking about their climate emergency hot air balloon which they wanted to launch over Parliament House last week. Senate president Scott Ryan has explained that when approval was sought, he learned that it was up to Casa to control the airspace above parliament, and a request was then made by DPS to have the access denied. Larissa Waters asked about a balloon that was seen above parliament this morning and why it had been allowed when its climate emergency protest balloon had not been. Ryan says that regardless of the cause, the presiding officers did not believe that any balloon should be allowed access to the airspace above Parliament House. He said it was a matter for Casa to police the current exclusion zone and added that they wanted to make the no-fly zone permanent. Andrew Wilkie has introduced a \u201cprotect refugees\u201d bill in the House. This bill provides for a sustainable, equitable and humane response to the protection and processing of asylum seekers and refugees in the Asia Pacific region. A key component of this bill is the Asia Pacific Asylum Seeker Solution (Apass), a regional framework to be initiated by the Australian government in partnership with other Asia Pacific countries. All countries party to Apass must be legally bound to provide effective protection for asylum seekers and refugees as provided under international law. It is identical to the refugee protection bill 2018, introduced to the House of Representatives by the member for Denison on 18 June 2018. In rural and regional affairs estimates, Labor is probing how Moyne shire council was declared eligible for $1m of drought assistance funding when the council said it wasn\u2019t in drought. Diana Hallam, the infrastructure department executive director of regional development and local government, explains that Moyne shire qualified because between 1 July 2017 and 30 June 2019 more than 60% of the shire had received 14 consecutive months of a one-in-20-year rainfall deficiency, and 17% of the workforce was engaged in agriculture, fisheries or forestry. But after the shire said it didn\u2019t need the funding, the department conducted an audit and discovered a small stuff-up. Either the data from the Bureau of Meteorology or the selection of it the department used ran until the end of May 2019 not June. Hallam said this did not affect the result \u2013 Moyne shire and the other 12 councils all qualified when the numbers were rerun over the correct 24-month period. No decision has yet been made by the government about what will happen to the $1m, which Moyne will not receive. Hallam: \u201cWe assess rainfall on a quarterly basis. With the conclusion of the 1 July to 30 September quarter we will assess eligibility again, and there will be another opportunity regarding whether new shires become eligible.\u201d Angus Taylor, on Sky News this morning, said he didn\u2019t know what a climate emergency actually meant (as in policy) and called it \u201cempty\u201d virtue signalling (which is something the Tories in the UK might raise an eyebrow at, considering they passed one.) Anyway, Mark Butler has moved this motion in the House: notes that: Climate change is a significant threat to our economy, natural environment, farming communities and national security; Australia\u2019s annual emissions have been rising in recent years; as a global problem, the solution to climate change requires concerted international cooperation to limit the production of greenhouse gases; as the only global agreement designed to address climate change, the Paris accords must play a central role in addressing climate change; the Paris accords require signatory countries to deliver actions consistent with keeping the global temperature rise this century to well below 2C above preindustrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C; based on the latest scientific advice, the world is currently on track for warming of above 3C, and efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions need to be strengthened to avoid catastrophic climate change impacts; and as a result of the threat posed by climate change, the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Portugal, Argentina and the Republic of Ireland have declared a climate emergency; and therefore, affirms that: Australia remains committed to delivering on its obligations under the Paris accords; failing to meet the goals of the Paris accords would have unprecedented and devastating environmental, economic, societal and health impacts for Australia; and the threat posed by climate change on the future prosperity and security of Australia and the globe constitutes a climate change emergency. Senate president Scott Ryan is refusing to answer questions about a hack on Parliament House that the country\u2019s intelligence agencies have said was carried out by a foreign government. Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick asked a series of questions about the data breach that took place in February and which targeted Australia\u2019s political parties. Ryan said he would not comment on whether a foreign government had been identified, nor any details of the data breach. \u201cI don\u2019t think it is appropriate for public consumption,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cI don\u2019t think these matters are appropriately canvassed in a public forum.\u201d Ryan said he had received a report on the data breach, but he did not think the report was \u201cappropriate\u201d for publication.\u201dI am not convinced that publishing the report I have received, even in a redacted form would be helpful.\u201d He said he would be receiving a further briefing and consulting with Speaker of the House, Tony Smith, before updating the Senate on what took place. It was reported by Reuters earlier this year that China was responsible for the cyber attack. Prime minister Scott Morrison told parliament that a \u201csophisticated state actor\u201d was responsible for the \u201cmalicious activity.\u201d Mike Bowers was in Senate estimates to capture new AFP commissioner Reece Kershaw doing his best Mariah Carey\u2019s \u201cI don\u2019t know her\u201d in response to questions about the media campaign today: You could also insert Keke Palmer\u2019s \u201csorry to this man\u201d response gif to not knowing who Dick Cheney was. In environment estimates, Katy Gallagher is asking about the department\u2019s failure to publish freedom of information documents on its public disclosure log for more than 10 months, a breach of FOI law. The department is saying an increase in FOI requests and \u201cIT matters\u201d have caused the issue. \u201cWe made a decision last year to change our disclosure log process so that documents were made immediately available,\u201d Margaret Tregurtha, from the department\u2019s general counsel branch, says. \u201cIt\u2019s apparent that in doing that we encountered some difficulties with the website. \u201cWe\u2019re now in a situation where we\u2019re making every effort to catch that up.\u201d Katy Gallagher is asking why, if it\u2019s a relatively simple process to upload documents to the website, has the delay in disclosures occurred. The department says that once the backlog of disclosures arose it became difficult to find time to catch up because they were prioritising the processing of FOI applications. Officials don\u2019t have information available to tell Labor the average processing for FOI applications it receives. The department says its intention is to publish the documents that should have been uploaded to the disclosure log since January. The department tells the committee that there are about 120 document packs that need to be published and there could be thousands of documents within those document packages. Katy Gallagher asks why advice was not sent to the ,inister\u2019s office if the department was in breach of the law. \u201cIf I was the minister I would want to know if my department was breaking the law,\u201d she says. Matt Cahill, the deputy secretary of the strategy and operations group, says the department is working to bring itself in line with the act. \u201cWe will bring ourselves up to standard in the next week,\u201d he says. Still with the AFP at estimates, the police commissioner has been asked by Green senator Nick McKim about the leaking of a home affairs briefing document that included advice from Asio. Quotes from this document, which was about the medevac regime, ended up in the front page of the Australian. The commissioner, Reece Kershaw, confirmed the AFP \u201cdeclined to escalate\u201d even though it was an unlawful disclosure. McKim wonders why. The commissioner says about 200 people had access to drafts of the document, but the final version went to 11 email addresses. He says there is a \u201cpriority system\u201d when it comes to launching leak investigations, which includes costs and the likely success of being able to produce a brief of evidence. McKim is less than convinced. Oh, there we go The Parliamentary Budget Office is being asked about a thought bubble from DPM Michael McCormack to move the ABC\u2019s Ultimo headquarters to regional Victoria. Labor senator Kimberley Kitching requested the PBO cost the proposal. Parliamentary Budget officer Jenny Wilkinson said the PBO was not able to calculate the fiscal impact of the idea, given it would require industry-specific expertise that it did not have. \u201cWe were not in a position to make a judgment.\u201d Yes this is inside baseball, but it was a big deal to everyone who works in this building, after a project clusterfriz ended with the entries being closed for more than a year, meaning a lot of equipment was lugged up a lot of stairs, rain, hail or snow. Reece Kershaw on press freedom (before admitting he had not seen the front page of today\u2019s papers, or \u201cturned his mind\u201d to the campaign: In regards to the recent inquiries and media reporting on the freedom of the press: as I have previously stated, police independence and freedom of the press are both fundamental pillars that coexist in our democracy. I strongly believe in these two pillars and this is the approach I intend to take. I welcome the direction from the minister for home affairs outlining his expectations in terms of taking into account the importance of a free and open press. In support of the direction, the AFP has finalised an internal national guideline on investigations of unauthorised disclosure of material made or obtained by a current or former commonwealth officer. I am also aware of the direction issued by the attorney general to the commonwealth director of public prosecutions. The attorney general\u2019s direction reaffirms the importance of the AFP to thoroughly investigate these matters and to collect all relevant information and evidence to ensure the attorney general and CDPP can make a fully informed decision, where relevant. As I mentioned earlier, the outcomes of the review conducted by John Lawler into sensitive investigations will better inform the AFP on how to deal with these matters. I look forward to working with you and your parliamentary colleagues to ensure the review takes into account the deliberations of other parliamentary inquiries currently under way. On the review the AFP commissioner has ordered, Reece Kershaw said: Further, in light of my public commitment to improve the processes around the recent investigations involving News Corp and the ABC, I have enlisted the services of former CEO of the Australian Crime Commission, Mr John Lawler AM, APM to conduct a review into all sensitive investigations. This incorporates matters relating to unauthorised disclosure; the application of parliamentary privilege; espionage and foreign interference; and war crimes. \u2022 The review will not be an audit into the current matters at hand but rather a holistic approach to ensure we have in place investigative policy and guidelines that are fit for purpose. Mr Lawler will provide my office with options around opportunities for interventions and strategies to ensure the AFP is best placed to address sensitive investigations in the future. This will include: \u2022 Baselining of what constitutes a sensitive investigation \u2022 Articulation of the human resources, skills, training, technology and facilities required \u2022 Reformation of governance and business processes (including alternative mechanisms for referring entities beyond the AFP) \u2022 Organisational structures. Over in the House, Greens MP Adam Bandt plans on introducing a private members\u2019 bill to have the voting age lowered to 16. A parliamentary inquiry looked into this last year, and said no. But Bandt says Gen Z have proved their worth: Most of the world\u2019s young people, including Australian teenagers are denied the right to vote and determine their country\u2019s and therefore the world\u2019s future. That is why they have taken to the streets. The Greens believe this reality of the climate crisis is one of the most profound reasons why our longstanding policy of enfranchising young people should finally once and for all be implemented. And that is why today I am proud to introduce to the House this bill to give 16 and 17-year-olds the right to vote. Senate estimates for the environment portfolio is under way. The first questions for the session are from Labor, who have gone straight to questions about Angus Taylor and the grasslands saga. But the right people from the department aren\u2019t in the room to answer questions, according to the department\u2019s deputy secretary, Dean Knudson. There\u2019s talk of calling them up early, including Geoff Richardson, who was one of the senior officials at a meeting with Taylor, the then minister Josh Frydenberg\u2019s office, and the department on 20 March 2017. More likely we will hear more about this when the department\u2019s biodiversity and compliance divisions are up later today. From Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee, where the Department of the Senate is first up. Senate president Scott Ryan is being grilled by Labor senator Jenny McAllister about the government\u2019s failure to comply with a Senate order regarding meetings with lobbyists and advocacy groups. McAllister says the government has claimed that it complies with ministerial standards and therefore is not providing further information. McAllister says this does not appear to be a public interest immunity reason for not complying with the request and says the response is \u201ccontemptuous\u201d. Ryan says he has not followed up the possibility of noncompliance and would only do so if the Senate moved a motion calling on him to do so. AFP commissioner Reece Kershaw takes on notice a question about whether or not there was a third day of raids planned, and then takes on notice a question on, if there was, when it was scrapped, and why. Kristina Keneally is asking Reece Kershaw if he has seen the front page of any newspaper today. He has not. Because \u201cthe bit of software I had said there was no front page today\u201d, he said, when asked the first time. Asked for the similarities, Kershaw says they seem to all have \u201cbig black marks through them\u201d. But as an \u201cevidence-based police officer\u201d, Kershaw says \u201cI haven\u2019t turned my mind\u201d to why the media campaign may be going on. Keneally says the AFP raids on journalists probably have something to do with it, but Kershaw says he would like to speak to the editors of the papers to see if that is what they think, before commenting. The senator then asks why Kershaw mentioned press freedom in his opening statement, if it\u2019s not something he had turned his mind to as yet. He says he is aware it has been an issue. The new AFP commissioner, Reece Kershaw, is facing his first estimates hearing since taking on the role, following Andrew Colvin\u2019s retirement. He is announcing a review \u201cinto sensitive investigations/disclosures\u201d to be conducted by John Lawler \u2013 but it is not going to be looking at the current investigations (that\u2019s the press freedom stuff). Home affairs estimates has begun \u2013 we were expecting Michaelia Cash to be in with the AFP, but Marise Payne has been sent in her place. Honestly, why this is allowed to continue is absolutely flabbergasting. There is a reason spouse and family interests are declared. That reason is obvious. Estimates are about to get under way. Christopher Pyne is speaking to Laura Jayes on Sky \u2013 she asks about finding your place in politics, which is very timely, given the number of people who are jostling for front-row positions at the moment. Pyne said he worked out very early on he would never be a \u201cstar like Malcolm Turnbull\u201d so found a place he was comfortable with. Which was, presumably, \u201cthe fixer\u201d. Scott Morrison also says no to Anthony Albanese and Joel Fitzgibbon\u2019s drought war cabinet idea (which is a dramatic way of saying a cross-party committee, with ministers and shadow ministers, dealing with an issue) Well, I\u2019ve noticed that point. If we as a government continue to consult widely and listen, most importantly, to people in rural and regional Australia. But I do note that even at a time, even when Australia actually was at war, there was no such war cabinet as described by the leader of the opposition. So they can explain the context of the nature of their proposal, but we were elected to get on with the job, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing. I think those sorts of proposals are novel, but they sort of, don\u2019t bear out against Australia\u2019s government experience. If you\u2019re not having a war cabinet involving non-government members in an actual time of war, and I point out that at the time of world war two breaking out, Sir Robert Menzies then, in the UAP who had sought to form coalitions both with the Labor party and the Country party at the time at a time of war, and that didn\u2019t come to effect and ultimately a Labor government was formed at that time under John Curtin. So they can make those proposals, but our government is filled, both in cabinet and on our benches, of Australians who have a direct experience and live in drought-affected communities, right across New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and South Australia, and indeed from other states where drought has affected them in the past. And so we have the right people and our ears are wide open and the commitments we\u2019ve made on the drought continue. It is a rolling response. Late yesterday, Scott Morrison spoke about that meeting Murph just wrote about. Here is what he had to say: I think what we saw today is that there is much analysis about the relationships that countries have with China and I think there is indeed a lot of over-analysis of those relationships and whether it\u2019s the United States and China, or anyone else. And I simply made the point, which was well received, that Australia is an independent sovereign nation. Yes, we are very much proud of our western liberal democratic tradition, our open economy and our engagement with the rest of the world, and that gives us a set of eyes that look into the world very much from our perspective. And I respect the fact that whether it\u2019s China, or indeed Indonesia or any other country in this part of the world, they will have their unique perspective and that\u2019s all fine. There\u2019s no issues with that. But what we also stressed today was, is that we will never feel corralled into any sort of binary assessment of these relationships. Binary assessments of a relationship which says pro-United States or pro-China, as Australia has a comprehensive strategic partnership with China and we have an enduring, and incredibly important alliance with the United States which is fundamental to our security. We have our biggest investment partnership with the United States and our biggest trade partnership with China and these are not mutually exclusive. And the comments that I\u2019ve made, particularly more recently which have been quite stoically in support of this independent, anti-binary view, I think are very well received. I took the opportunity to congratulate China on where they were able to get to with the United States on the first phase of their trade discussions. I think that\u2019s very good for the global economy and I think it bears out the optimism that we\u2019ve always had about rejecting this binary nature. It\u2019s simply a fact that China has arrived at an incredibly impressive point in its economic history. It\u2019s impossible to dispute that. And that means that they\u2019ve done incredibly well and raises their level of technological achievement and capability. Similarly, more broadly in their economy but also say, militarily, and that\u2019s a reflection of the significant progress they\u2019ve made over that time. And so, you know, one can only acknowledge that and then pursue our partnership based on our interests, which are aligned with China to the extent that we have both done so incredibly well out of their success. And so that was the dominating part of our discussion today. It\u2019s interesting that the prime minister used a visit to observe the Indonesian president Joko Widodo\u2019s inauguration to have a meeting with the Chinese vice-president, Wang Qishan. I\u2019ve written a lot over the past month or two about Scott Morrison\u2019s efforts to align Australia and the US but less about the effort over the same time period to warm up the relationship with Beijing. Over the past couple of months, the foreign minister, Marise Payne, has met her Chinese counterpart twice (most recently in New York during UN leaders week), and now this meeting in Jakarta. Australia sought the meeting and it was approved by the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. Anthony Albanese was also asked about press freedoms yesterday \u2013and why Labor is now pushing for change Well, the urgency is that what we didn\u2019t see under Labor governments was consecutive raids on journalists. What we didn\u2019t see was the sort of attacks on media freedom and what we also wouldn\u2019t have seen, to be frank, is a prime minister, who when first asked about this in London, basically said: \u2018Nothing to see here.\u2019 It is a dismissal as a government that wasn\u2019t prepared to protect media freedom. The government needs to step up to the plate here. Labor\u2019s prepared to. The government should as well. Scott Morrison was asked about press freedoms yesterday, while in Indonesia: Well, we are, and we have a process currently going on the way at the moment in a joint parliamentary inquiry. We\u2019ve already acted to issue the minister for home affairs\u2019 guidelines and direction which I think both well codify what the processes are, and in fact improve them, and I think that\u2019s been well received, particularly by groups like the AFP which are finding those instructions very, very helpful. So I do think that\u2019s an improvement, but we\u2019ll still await the report from the inquiry. But let me simply say this \u2013 my government will always believe in freedom of the press. It\u2019s an important part of our freedoms as a liberal democracy. Also believe in the rule of law and that no one is above it, including me or anyone else, any journalist or anyone else. And the rule of law has to be applied evenly and fairly in the protection of our broader freedoms. And so I don\u2019t think anyone is, I hope, looking for a leave pass on any of those things, I wouldn\u2019t and nor should anyone else. Barnaby Joyce had a few things to say about the media freedom laws \u2013 it went as you would expect. Welcome to day one of Senate estimates! The House will sit while the senators do their thing in the committee rooms. It\u2019ll be the first time we\u2019ve seen Penny Wong really unleashed since the election, so that in itself should be something. Kristina Keneally also gets some time with the home affairs officials, so that\u2019s another one to watch. Scott Morrison arrived back in Australia (he was in Indonesia yesterday for Joko Widodo\u2019s inauguration as president) to an unchanged Newspoll (yes, insert all the polling caveats here), 51 to 49, in the Coalition\u2019s favour. The \u201cbig stick\u201d energy laws will be debated (Labor has given its support, despite originally opposing them) and religious discrimination will be back on the agenda. The medevac inquiry bill was tabled on Friday \u2013 it went, as you would expect, down party lines, with negotiations with Jacqui Lambie ongoing. The Senate can\u2019t vote on those until it next sits in November, and that is where the legislation\u2019s fate hangs. Lambie is the swing vote \u2013 and she will spend the next few weeks continuing to meet with everyone who has something to say on this legislation before casting her vote. And all of the Canberra going ons are happening as media companies unite against the secrecy laws which make it increasingly difficult to do our jobs. As Guardian Australia\u2019s editor, Lenore Taylor, has laid out: We have six core demands: The right to challenge the government\u2019s application for warrants against journalists and media organisations, before they are issued. Exemptions for journalists from laws that would put them in jail for doing their jobs, including the security laws enacted over the last seven years. Adequate legislated protections for public sector whistleblowers. A new regime to limit which documents can be stamped secret. Reform of the freedom of information regime. Reform to laws that make Australia the defamation capital of the world. We\u2019ll have all of that, as well as everything else. Mike Bowers will be with you, as will Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin and Paul Karp. I will find another coffee and find some more brain cells to be with you in just a moment. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.",

      "bodyText": "The Chinese billionaire Huang Xiangmo has been given 21 days to declare all of his assets around the world to the federal court, as the Australian Taxation Office pursues him over an alleged $140m tax bill. The reclusive Huang, exiled from Australia over security agencies\u2019 concerns about foreign political interference, is fighting an ATO demand for more than $140m in unpaid taxes, interest and penalties. The ATO is seeking to have Huang declared bankrupt in Australia, applying for a summary judgment which could be the basis for pursuing his assets over the bill. In the federal court on Monday, Justice Jayne Jagot continued an order freezing all of Huang\u2019s assets, including those outside of Australia, and ordered that he disclose his assets worldwide within 21 days. Huang\u2019s barrister, Nathan Li, foreshadowed a likely appeal against the disclosure of assets outside of Australia. The ATO\u2019s application before the court says Huang owes $140,925,953.98 in unpaid taxes from 2013 to 2015. \u201cThe ATO formed the opinion during the audit into Mr Huang\u2019s taxation affairs ... that Mr Huang had \u2018grossly understated\u2019 his income and made false or misleading statements to the Commissioner in respect of the income tax returns with \u2018recklessness\u2019,\u201d the ATO said in its submissions to the court. Ahead of a judgment in the case, argument before the federal court has centred on the limits of the freezing order, and whether the court should \u2013 or practicably could \u2013 order a freeze on assets held outside of Australia. Lawyers for Huang had sought to carve out Huang\u2019s overseas assets from the freezing order, as well a $12.8m Mosman mansion held in the name of his wife, Jiefang Huang. The mansion is the largest asset remaining in Australia. Huang\u2019s lawyers argue it belongs to his wife, and should be exempted from the freezing order. The ATO points to bank records that show Huang withdrew more than $5m from a bank account he controlled on the day the property settled, arguing it was used to help purchase the property. Jiefang Huang\u2019s affidavit to the court, in which she gives her occupation as \u201chousewife\u201d and her income as $100,000 a year, says the funds were a gift from her husband. Noel Hutley SC, for Huang, said last week that Huang\u2019s international assets should be excluded from any freezing order, arguing there was not the \u201cremotest possibility\u201d an Australian order could be enforced overseas. Hutley said freezing orders should not be issued where there was no prospect of them being enforced. \u201cThese orders are orders of the most intrusive variety.\u201d But Anthony McInerney SC, for the tax office, said that in regard to assets held in China or Hong Kong, enforcement, while unlikely, was not \u201cnot impossible\u201d. In issuing the original freezing order against Huang in September, Justice Anna Katzmann said Huang had pulled nearly $50m out of Australia since his permanent residency was cancelled by the government last December on advice from Asio over concerns about foreign political interference. \u201cAlthough [Huang] transferred money overseas before he was aware that he was under investigation by the ATO, since the audit began the amount of money transferred offshore increased dramatically,\u201d Katzmann said. Katzmann said that although there was no direct evidence that Huang \u201cintended to divest himself of his Australian assets or diminish them in value, the results of the audit indicate an intention to avoid paying tax by grossly understating income\u201d. She said the flow of money back and forth between China and Australia showed Huang was \u201clikely to be a person of substantial wealth\u201d but he did not appear to have enough assets in Australia to pay the posited ATO bill. \u201cThese circumstances demonstrate that Mr Huang has both a motive and the means to dissipate his Australian assets.\u201d Huang, a Chinese billionaire property developer who arrived in Australia in 2011, assiduously cultivated influence with both sides of Australian politics during his time in the country, donating $2.7m to both the Liberal and Labor parties and appearing in photographs with prime ministers and ministers. The Labor senator Sam Dastyari was forced to resign from parliament after revelations he had asked Huang for money to pay personal legal bills and warned Huang he was under surveillance. Huang\u2019s permanent residency visa was summarily cancelled \u2013 and his application for Australian citizenship withdrawn \u2013 by the Morrison government last December on character grounds, and after Asio warned political parties against accepting any more money from Huang. Of particular concern was his long-running involvement with the Australian Council for the Promotion of the Peaceful Reunification of China, which has been accused of being a front for Chinese government efforts to expand its global influence. Despite his exile from Australia, Huang has re-emerged as a key figure in the Independent Commission Against Corruption\u2019s current investigation into Labor party donations last month. Icac has heard allegations that Huang gave the New South Wales branch of the ALP $100,000 \u2013 personally delivered in cash in an Aldi shopping bag \u2013 in breach of electoral regulations which prohibit property developers donating. From Hong Kong, Huang has denied being the source of the money but has declined to give evidence to Icac.",

Initially, he wanted to create an online forum where followers could share their own favourite \u00a31 meals. \u201cBut no one else submitted any recipes,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was all my dishes, and people just came and cooked them and said, \u2018Thank you.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Three and a half years on, the number of Instagrammers following <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/miguelbarclay/?hl=en\" title=\"\">@miguelbarclay</a> and saying \u201cthank you\u201d is more than 303,000 and rising. Things began to hot up in July 2016, when Barclay posted a video recipe for chicken katsu curry, listing the price of each ingredient (1 chicken thigh 29p; splash of soy 2p; 1 tbsp flour 1p \u2026), totalling just 55p. \u201cIt got 30,000 views,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThen someone from [ITV\u2019s] <em>This Morning</em> rang me up and asked, \u2018Do you want to cook your chicken katsu curry on the show?\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>The first <em>One Pound Meals</em> cookbook followed in January 2017 (a fifth book is due out in December, with two more in the pipeline), and soon afterwards Barclay quit his job to manage his Instagram account full time. Not only does he post recipes for dishes as varied as toad-in-the-hole and artichoke paella, many of them condensed into short, step-by-step videos, he also documents the minutiae of his daily life, addressing his audience from bed in the morning and taking us out on date nights with his wife, Lucey.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> \n <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BIX_QMTj4n2/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

In the absence of a son who would eventually take over their land according to rural Chinese tradition, her parents hoped she would remain in the village. \u201cBut I was rebellious and I wanted my freedom,\u201d she says. At 13 she was taken in by a family friend in Xi\u2019an, who treated her like a granddaughter and encouraged her to choose a profession like dressmaking, but, having been inspired as a child by her own grandmother\u2019s cooking, she decided to go to culinary college instead. A self-declared tomboy, she thrived as one of a handful of girls at a cooking school with more than a thousand male students, particularly, she says, thanks to the kindness of the deputy head, who impressed upon her the importance of self-reliance. After a year at college, she did a year\u2019s work experience in the local pastry arts before moving to an upmarket restaurant where she worked for seven years, winning a gold medal in a provincial pastry contest and eventually rising to the rank not only of head chef, but the only female head chef in Xi\u2019an.</p> \n<p>In 2008, she was introduced to the owner of the Sichuanese restaurant <a href=\"https://barshurestaurant.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Barshu</a>, who persuaded her to come to work in London. \u201cMy first impression of London was how polite people were,\u201d she says, \u201cBut at first I didn\u2019t have much time to explore. Before I came here, I thought western food was simply like KFC and McDonalds, but since then I\u2019ve discovered many delicious things, including tapas and pizza.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ee2dffbf-f479-4b04-80c6-4b5c354ee4a1\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0mO98b9dvps?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Wei is a passionate advocate of the cooking of her hometown. \u201cXi\u2019an food is very traditional, and many dishes have ancient roots,\u201d she says. \u201cThe northern climate is much better suited to growing wheat than the south, which is why we have so many flour-foods [including noodles, dumplings and breads]. Many of them are usually handmade to order, including biang biang noodles, ear-like pasta shells (mashi), pulled noodles (<em>la tiaozi</em>) and boiled dumplings (<em>shuijiao</em>). We also eat a lot of beef and lamb, and adore <em>suanla</em>, the sour and hot flavour. Xi\u2019an food isn\u2019t as electrifying as the Sichuanese, but we use a great many seasonings.\u201d These include cumin, vinegar and a variety of spices \u2013 and many chilli oils for different purposes.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The Xi\u2019an food I miss most is shuipen yangrou, a soup of slow-cooked lamb finished with slippery noodles and coriander</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cThe Xi\u2019an food I miss most when I\u2019m in England is \u2018water-basin lamb\u2019 (<em>shuipen yangrou</em>), a traditional dish that has recently become popular at home. It\u2019s a great soup of slow-cooked lamb with spices that is finished off with slippery noodles and coriander,\u201d Wei says, adding that she also misses the fresh walnuts used in cold dishes in the harvest season. Most of the ingredients Wei needs to cook Xi\u2019an food in London \u2013 including Chinese cardamom, coriander seeds and cassia bark \u2013 she buys in Indian shops. \u201cThe only thing I really need to bring back from Shaanxi is our pounded dried chillies (<em>lajiaomian</em>), which are particularly fragrant and not too hot.\u201d She admits that she tones some of her flavours down a bit for British tastes: \u201cXi\u2019an people like garlic so much that they will munch on whole raw cloves \u2013 obviously I don\u2019t use so much garlic here.\u201d</p> \n<p>As the eldest child in her family, Wei supported both her sisters through their education: one is now a doctor, the other works in the vegetable wholesale trade. She now works with her husband, Song Yong, another Xi\u2019an native, who mostly oversees Xi\u2019an Impression while she runs Master Wei. In the future, she says, she hopes to open a vegetarian restaurant focusing on Shaanxi Buddhist temple food. Wei has been overwhelmed by Londoners\u2019 enthusiasm for her food: \u201cI never expected local people to like it so much!\u201d </p> \n<p><em><a href=\"http://masterwei.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Master Wei</a>, 13 Cosmo Pl, </em><em>London WC1N 3AP</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2019/10/ofm-awards-label-2019-atom\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

Wei grew up in a poor, mountainous region of southern Shaanxi, the eldest of three daughters. In the absence of a son who would eventually take over their land according to rural Chinese tradition, her parents hoped she would remain in the village. \u201cBut I was rebellious and I wanted my freedom,\u201d she says. At 13 she was taken in by a family friend in Xi\u2019an, who treated her like a granddaughter and encouraged her to choose a profession like dressmaking, but, having been inspired as a child by her own grandmother\u2019s cooking, she decided to go to culinary college instead. A self-declared tomboy, she thrived as one of a handful of girls at a cooking school with more than a thousand male students, particularly, she says, thanks to the kindness of the deputy head, who impressed upon her the importance of self-reliance. After a year at college, she did a year\u2019s work experience in the local pastry arts before moving to an upmarket restaurant where she worked for seven years, winning a gold medal in a provincial pastry contest and eventually rising to the rank not only of head chef, but the only female head chef in Xi\u2019an. In 2008, she was introduced to the owner of the Sichuanese restaurant Barshu, who persuaded her to come to work in London. \u201cMy first impression of London was how polite people were,\u201d she says, \u201cBut at first I didn\u2019t have much time to explore. Before I came here, I thought western food was simply like KFC and McDonalds, but since then I\u2019ve discovered many delicious things, including tapas and pizza.\u201d Wei is a passionate advocate of the cooking of her hometown. \u201cXi\u2019an food is very traditional, and many dishes have ancient roots,\u201d she says. \u201cThe northern climate is much better suited to growing wheat than the south, which is why we have so many flour-foods [including noodles, dumplings and breads]. Many of them are usually handmade to order, including biang biang noodles, ear-like pasta shells (mashi), pulled noodles (la tiaozi) and boiled dumplings (shuijiao). We also eat a lot of beef and lamb, and adore suanla, the sour and hot flavour. Xi\u2019an food isn\u2019t as electrifying as the Sichuanese, but we use a great many seasonings.\u201d These include cumin, vinegar and a variety of spices \u2013 and many chilli oils for different purposes. \u201cThe Xi\u2019an food I miss most when I\u2019m in England is \u2018water-basin lamb\u2019 (shuipen yangrou), a traditional dish that has recently become popular at home. It\u2019s a great soup of slow-cooked lamb with spices that is finished off with slippery noodles and coriander,\u201d Wei says, adding that she also misses the fresh walnuts used in cold dishes in the harvest season. Most of the ingredients Wei needs to cook Xi\u2019an food in London \u2013 including Chinese cardamom, coriander seeds and cassia bark \u2013 she buys in Indian shops. \u201cThe only thing I really need to bring back from Shaanxi is our pounded dried chillies (lajiaomian), which are particularly fragrant and not too hot.\u201d She admits that she tones some of her flavours down a bit for British tastes: \u201cXi\u2019an people like garlic so much that they will munch on whole raw cloves \u2013 obviously I don\u2019t use so much garlic here.\u201d As the eldest child in her family, Wei supported both her sisters through their education: one is now a doctor, the other works in the vegetable wholesale trade. She now works with her husband, Song Yong, another Xi\u2019an native, who mostly oversees Xi\u2019an Impression while she runs Master Wei. In the future, she says, she hopes to open a vegetarian restaurant focusing on Shaanxi Buddhist temple food. Wei has been overwhelmed by Londoners\u2019 enthusiasm for her food: \u201cI never expected local people to like it so much!\u201d Master Wei, 13 Cosmo Pl, London WC1N 3AP",

Some of those recipes have a kilo of pistachios in them \u2026, and that\u2019s never going to be appropriate today.\u201d Instead, she updates old ideas by marrying them with her tastes and experience. \u201cFor example, the Mughals were not huge fans of salad,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I love salads, so I\u2019ve used their concepts to develop my own Mughal-style salads\u201d \u2013 such as guava, peach, black salt and mint. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with that.\u201d Unusual combinations, such as smoked chicken and basil kebabs with beetroot salad and buttermilk raita, prove irresistible \u2013 as does the broad mix of cuisines, neatly tied by the Mughal theme. \u201cWhen I\u2019ve given the book to people from Iran, they can relate to many of the recipes,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd when I give it to Pakistani people, they find the recipes both familiar and different, which they seem to like.\u201d Khazana has found favour with British readers too. \u201cAt a festival the other day, someone was looking at my book and another girl passed by and said, \u2018Don\u2019t think about it, just buy it: it\u2019s great,\u2019\u201d Mahmood Ahmed recalls. \u201cThat was so rewarding for me.\u201d To write the book, Mahmood Ahmed went part-time at work and now she has a \u201c50/50 career\u201d as a doctor and food personality. As a gastroenterologist, she deals with food-related ailments and digestive disorders and she would like to write \u201csomething unique in that domain, drawing from my understanding of gut health and eating food in ways that are more beneficial than simply dieting and cutting calories\u201d. And then, of course, there are other parts of her heritage to be explored, \u201cwhether that\u2019s the Pakistani part, the Kashmiri part \u2013 or the huge Anglo-Indian influence in my life. I have loads of ideas.\u201d She takes a breath. \u201cI\u2019ve just got to decide which direction I go in next.\u201d Khazana: A Treasure Trove of Modern Mughal Dishes (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, \u00a325).

The Cowboys in particular needed a strong showing after losing three in a row. And they got it as Ezekiel Elliott put up a 100-yard night in a big victory. Credit to Dallas kicker Brett Maher too: his 63-yard field goal means he is the only player in NFL history with three successful kicks from beyond 60 yards. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rodger/status/1186115694967934976\">He is now three-for-three</a> in his career on field goals of more than 60 yards.</p> <p>- Give the Dolphins an extra gold-star for this week\u2019s tanking project.

Trailing by five with 2:41 left on fourth down inside the Texans\u2019 own 10-yard line, O\u2019Brien used one of his three timeouts so that his team could take an intentional safety. Why he chose to let 30 seconds tick away before he made that call, or why he didn\u2019t just take a delay of game will forever remain a mystery.</p> <p>- The Colts\u2019 generational quarterback retired two weeks before the start of the season and they\u2019re still in first place in the AFC South. Coach Frank Reich and GM John Ballard have done a marvelous job in Indy. Outside of Seattle and New England, there\u2019s no better Coach-GM combination in the league.</p> <p>- Some numbers from Kirk Cousins\u2019 last three games: 74% completion percentage, 976 yards (10.8 YPA), 10 touchdowns, one interception. Against the Lions, he became the first passer in history to have three straight games throwing for more than 300 yards with a passer rating above 130. Don\u2019t count the Vikings out yet.</p>",

Then there\u2019s Eric Ebron, who pulled off his own super-human feat against the Texans. Watch him stick out one his extend-o arms and pluck that sucker out of the sky. Then convince his feet to observe the laws of gravity in double-time: Elsewhere around the league - The Eagles and Cowboys met on Sunday Night Football, with the winner taking sole possession of first place in the NFC East. The Cowboys in particular needed a strong showing after losing three in a row. And they got it as Ezekiel Elliott put up a 100-yard night in a big victory. Credit to Dallas kicker Brett Maher too: his 63-yard field goal means he is the only player in NFL history with three successful kicks from beyond 60 yards. He is now three-for-three in his career on field goals of more than 60 yards. - Give the Dolphins an extra gold-star for this week\u2019s tanking project. Miami accidentally converted on an obvious fake field-goal against Buffalo, leading to first-and-goal from the three-yard line with a chance to take the lead. So, the Dolphins promptly left a Bills lineman unblocked, and he obliterated Ryan Fitzpatrick. On the next play, Fitzpatrick tossed a pick. Chess not checkers. - The Niners moved to 6-0 with a solid win over Washington in tricky weather conditions. The Niners defense continues to prove it\u2019s one of the best in the league. - Bill O\u2019Brien continues to befuddle on a weekly basis. Trailing by five with 2:41 left on fourth down inside the Texans\u2019 own 10-yard line, O\u2019Brien used one of his three timeouts so that his team could take an intentional safety. Why he chose to let 30 seconds tick away before he made that call, or why he didn\u2019t just take a delay of game will forever remain a mystery. - The Colts\u2019 generational quarterback retired two weeks before the start of the season and they\u2019re still in first place in the AFC South. Coach Frank Reich and GM John Ballard have done a marvelous job in Indy. Outside of Seattle and New England, there\u2019s no better Coach-GM combination in the league. - Some numbers from Kirk Cousins\u2019 last three games: 74% completion percentage, 976 yards (10.8 YPA), 10 touchdowns, one interception. Against the Lions, he became the first passer in history to have three straight games throwing for more than 300 yards with a passer rating above 130. Don\u2019t count the Vikings out yet.",

UPDATE: Solution now available here. Clarifications: The four points must be distinct. That is, no point is allowed to be superimposed on another point. For each solution, we exclude all reflections, rotations and different sizes of that solution. Also, if the two distances that occur between any two of the four points in one solution are a and b, then the two distances that appear in another solution are not necessarily a and b. I set a puzzle here every two weeks on a Monday. I\u2019m always on the look-out for great puzzles. If you would like to suggest one, email me. My new book So You Think You\u2019ve Got Problems? is out on November 7. It\u2019s a puzzle book, but also a book of true stories and mathematical ideas. The 200 puzzles I selected all, in different ways, contain an element of surprise. If you enjoy my column, I hope you\u2019ll enjoy this book.",

Seven years later, he returned to his hometown to celebrate his younger brother\u2019s graduation. In the interim, he had become a multimillionaire.</p> <p>Alongside his older brother Larry, Billy Joe arrived at Lee senior high school in a mint-white Cadillac, trailed by four identical cars that carried their extended entourage. Their cavalcade precipitated the kind of welcome usually reserved for film stars, the assembled parents and children surrounding their cars, cheering and screaming like starstruck fans. According to David Farber, a bemused teacher \u201cwatched the men inside the cars roll down their windows and throw handfuls of money into the worshipful crowd\u201d.</p> <p>The Chambers brothers were crack cocaine dealers. Their business model was based on mainstream capitalist enterprise (\u201cBuy one, get one free\u201d); they even ran a reward scheme whereby regular customers were given free produce if they brought new customers along with them to the crack houses. In the brutally Darwinian world in which they operated, the siblings were relatively restrained both in their violence and the parading of their wealth.</p> <p>By the early 1990s, though, a new generation of crack kingpins was being eulogised by hip-hop stars such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/snoopdogg\" title=\"\">Snoop Dogg</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/dec/16/the-notorious-big-biggie-smalls-10-of-the-best\" title=\"\">Biggie Smalls</a>, both of whom had graduated from dealing to rapping, for their ruthlessness, violence and misogyny.

      "body": "<p>The first season of Netflix comedy Insatiable was mired in controversy from the very first trailer, which featured the slender actor Debby Ryan donning a fat suit to play Patty Bladell, an overweight and relentlessly bullied teen who seeks revenge after she transforms into a slim beauty pageant contestant. The show was clearly intended to be a satire of pageant culture \u00e0 la Drop Dead Gorgeous, but the candy-colored tones never quite squared with the show\u2019s sense of humor, which could be recklessly cruel without ever being particularly funny. The show was panned by TV critics (it received only a 13% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes), but the constant stream of press also led to a large viewership and so, somewhat amazingly, it\u2019s returned for a second season.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/30/the-politician-ryan-murphy-netflix-most-annoying-tv-show-of-2019\">Is The Politician the most annoying TV show of 2019?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I expected Insatiable to lean even further into controversy this time around. After all, any number of shows that receive tremendous critical acclaim (Tuca &amp; Bertie, anyone?) don\u2019t necessarily meet the viewership necessary for Netflix to offer a series another go. But although intrigue about the show\u2019s more inflammatory elements may have increased the number of people watching, the second season of Insatiable isn\u2019t at all interested in controversy.</p> <p>Instead, it quietly attends to its previous mistakes in a way that is almost overwhelming earnest.

      "bodyText": "The first season of Netflix comedy Insatiable was mired in controversy from the very first trailer, which featured the slender actor Debby Ryan donning a fat suit to play Patty Bladell, an overweight and relentlessly bullied teen who seeks revenge after she transforms into a slim beauty pageant contestant. The show was clearly intended to be a satire of pageant culture \u00e0 la Drop Dead Gorgeous, but the candy-colored tones never quite squared with the show\u2019s sense of humor, which could be recklessly cruel without ever being particularly funny. The show was panned by TV critics (it received only a 13% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes), but the constant stream of press also led to a large viewership and so, somewhat amazingly, it\u2019s returned for a second season. I expected Insatiable to lean even further into controversy this time around. After all, any number of shows that receive tremendous critical acclaim (Tuca &amp; Bertie, anyone?) don\u2019t necessarily meet the viewership necessary for Netflix to offer a series another go. But although intrigue about the show\u2019s more inflammatory elements may have increased the number of people watching, the second season of Insatiable isn\u2019t at all interested in controversy. Instead, it quietly attends to its previous mistakes in a way that is almost overwhelming earnest. Nowhere is this clearer than in the way it handles Patty\u2019s overeating. In the first season, Patty\u2019s propensity to binge was presented as a joke; in season two, we actually see her eating disorder get taken seriously, with Patty regularly attending an overeaters anonymous support group, featuring people of all shapes and sizes who struggle with various eating issues. Everyone from her goofy pageant manager to her best friend to her mom earnestly discusses how important it is that Patty seeks help for what they now see as a very real problem.

      "body": "<p>The autoworkers picketing outside General Motors\u2019 Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant stand to gain more than most if a tentative deal with the company is ultimately approved this week. For a start their jobs would be spared. GM previously slated the plant for closure by January. Instead, its 700 employees could start building electric pickup trucks next year.</p> <p>But as the United Auto Workers (UAW) strike appears to be ending, after more than a month, emotions outside the plant were decidedly mixed last week. Those who spoke with the Guardian said their feelings fell somewhere between \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d and \u201cskeptical\u201d as a slow trickle of news came from UAW leadership.</p> <p>The union released an <a href=\"https://uaw.org/see-summary-tentative-agreement-gm/\">outline of the deal</a> last week but the details are still only known to \u201cthe guys at the bargaining table\u201d, said Paul Radatz, a 34-year company veteran. Over the weekend UAW members were getting to grips with those details. Voting started on Saturday and is expected to be completed by Friday.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we hear so far all sounds good, but that\u2019s what they\u2019ll do \u2013 come out and tell us all the highlights,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this happens with every contract, and there are always things that we have lost that don\u2019t come out until it\u2019s ratified and in print. So we\u2019re waiting for the other shoe to drop.\u201d</p> <p>An hour north in Flint, D\u2019Andre Jackson, a UAW district committee representative said workers at the Flint assembly plant shared that sentiment. While there\u2019s some optimism, \u201cthere\u2019s some anxiety\u201d over what isn\u2019t yet known.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to see just the shiny chrome pieces. I want to see the meat and potatoes,\u201d Jackson said.</p> <p>The strike has cost GM $100m a day, according to analysts, and there\u2019s no doubt that the UAW has won some significant concessions, a major victory for the union after its longest strike in 10 years. Workers are also feeling ebullient about the resurgence of unions, which are gaining ground as<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/17/chicago-teachers-strike-stops-classes-for-361000-students\"> teachers and others</a> have successfully campaigned for wage rises and more. But striking takes its toll.</p> <p>On a cold and windy Thursday small groups of employees waved signs outside the six entrances around the sprawling, 4m sq ft Detroit-Hamtramck plant just a few miles north of GM\u2019s downtown headquarters. They warmed themselves around fires burning in 55-gallon drums and pumped fists as passing motorists hit their horns in solidarity.</p> <p>The highlights of the deal that UAW workers are processing include $11,000 ratification bonuses, paths to full-time employment for temporary workers, pay increases, no changes to healthcare, and other clear wins for the union. The UAW national General Motors council decided on Thursday to recommend ratification, and the rank and file will now vote on it.</p> <p>At least one obvious <a href=\"https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2019/10/17/gm-strike-update-lordstown-uaw/4007368002/\">sticking point</a> remains. Some outside Detroit-Hamtramck vowed to vote against any deal that didn\u2019t also include new product for the recently shuttered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/23/general-motors-factory-ohio-lordstown\">Lordstown, Ohio, plant.</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb1b4090aa1be7ff85cb2fe940a583887299eea5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb1b4090aa1be7ff85cb2fe940a583887299eea5/0_133_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"United Auto Workers members picket outside General Motors Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly in Detroit last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">United Auto Workers members picket outside General Motors Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly in Detroit last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Kowalsky/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Beyond that, some frustration still exists, and Radatz said management\u2019s \u201cgreed\u201d is still on his mind. He noted that the $11,000 bonuses pale in comparison to the roughly $11,000 per hour that GM\u2019s CEO, Mary Berra, earns. He and others say they aren\u2019t convinced that GM ever truly planned to close Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly because the company invested big in it in recent years, while rumors of an electric truck started months ago. Radatz called the proposal to close the plant a false \u201cnegotiating chip\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cNow they can say, \u2018See, we\u2019re bargaining in good faith,\u2019 but they haven\u2019t been. That\u2019s a joke,\u201d Radatz said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t blame them. You want to have an ace up your sleeve.\u201d</p> <p>Feelings outside Detroit-Hamtramck were also mixed over building electric trucks. While the plant may live to see another day, some are disappointed the company is only promising \u201ca low volume\u201d vehicle that\u2019s viewed as a \u201ctest product to see how the public takes to it\u201d. But Julaynne Trusel, a team leader in the body shop, said it beats the alternative.</p> <p>\u201cThe doors are staying open and everyone doesn\u2019t need to start looking for jobs, so at least it\u2019s a step in the right direction,\u201d she said. \u201cHopefully we get some more business over the life of the contract.\u201d</p> <p>Though there\u2019s still some frustration over the bitter fight that played out in recent years and culminated with the strike, employees don\u2019t expect any resentment to linger should the stoppage conclude. After all, the two sides were just \u201clooking out for themselves\u201d, Trusel said.</p> <p>\u201cThis is just business and everyone had to handle their business,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we come back together, we are going to be like one. We all want to produce the best cars that we can for our customers, so we\u2019re not going back in with a bad attitude.\u201d</p> <p>George Raptis, a materials department employee who has been at Detroit-Hamtramck since 1993, echoed that: \u201cWe all want to get back to work, and when we do things will go on like it\u2019s another day.\u201d</p> <p>The stoppage, which is the longest GM has faced since 1970, is inflicting pain on both sides. About 48,000 UAW workers, including 17,000 in Michigan, walked off the job. GM has lost more than $1.5bn because of the strike, while union workers lost more than $835m in wages, according to the East Lansing industry analyst Anderson Economic Group. Union workers are earning just $250 a week, and GM temporarily pulled their health insurance last month.</p> <p>\u201c$250 per week is less than my spousal payment, so I\u2019m in the hole,\u201d said a Detroit-Hamtramck body shop employee and 35-year company veteran who declined to give his name. In Flint, Jackson delayed renovations on a new house he and his wife purchased not long before the strike.</p> <p>\u201cYou definitely tighten up the belt and fry up a couple bologna sandwiches instead of grilling up some steaks,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Trusel added that support from other unions and the public helped get workers through financial difficulties. Those picketing outside the plant received free meals and donations of food, diapers, toiletries and other essentials.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s been so much support for us. It brings you to tears to know that people care so much,\u201d Trusel said. \u201cIt\u2019s been encouraging to know that so many people are saying \u2018Stand your ground\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Should the union come away with a win and public support for workers remain high, the strike could be a shot in the arm for the UAW and the largely beleaguered US labor movement. Radatz applauded leadership for \u201clocking horns with GM\u201d and said its handling of the strike so far has restored the rank and file\u2019s faith.</p> <p>\u201cThe union was very weak before the contract and now it\u2019s solid,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are standing with each other and they\u2019re backing each other 110%.\u201d</p>",

So we\u2019re waiting for the other shoe to drop.\u201d An hour north in Flint, D\u2019Andre Jackson, a UAW district committee representative said workers at the Flint assembly plant shared that sentiment. While there\u2019s some optimism, \u201cthere\u2019s some anxiety\u201d over what isn\u2019t yet known. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see just the shiny chrome pieces. I want to see the meat and potatoes,\u201d Jackson said. The strike has cost GM $100m a day, according to analysts, and there\u2019s no doubt that the UAW has won some significant concessions, a major victory for the union after its longest strike in 10 years. Workers are also feeling ebullient about the resurgence of unions, which are gaining ground as teachers and others have successfully campaigned for wage rises and more. But striking takes its toll. On a cold and windy Thursday small groups of employees waved signs outside the six entrances around the sprawling, 4m sq ft Detroit-Hamtramck plant just a few miles north of GM\u2019s downtown headquarters. They warmed themselves around fires burning in 55-gallon drums and pumped fists as passing motorists hit their horns in solidarity. The highlights of the deal that UAW workers are processing include $11,000 ratification bonuses, paths to full-time employment for temporary workers, pay increases, no changes to healthcare, and other clear wins for the union. The UAW national General Motors council decided on Thursday to recommend ratification, and the rank and file will now vote on it. At least one obvious sticking point remains. Some outside Detroit-Hamtramck vowed to vote against any deal that didn\u2019t also include new product for the recently shuttered Lordstown, Ohio, plant. Beyond that, some frustration still exists, and Radatz said management\u2019s \u201cgreed\u201d is still on his mind. He noted that the $11,000 bonuses pale in comparison to the roughly $11,000 per hour that GM\u2019s CEO, Mary Berra, earns. He and others say they aren\u2019t convinced that GM ever truly planned to close Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly because the company invested big in it in recent years, while rumors of an electric truck started months ago. Radatz called the proposal to close the plant a false \u201cnegotiating chip\u201d. \u201cNow they can say, \u2018See, we\u2019re bargaining in good faith,\u2019 but they haven\u2019t been. That\u2019s a joke,\u201d Radatz said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t blame them. You want to have an ace up your sleeve.\u201d Feelings outside Detroit-Hamtramck were also mixed over building electric trucks. While the plant may live to see another day, some are disappointed the company is only promising \u201ca low volume\u201d vehicle that\u2019s viewed as a \u201ctest product to see how the public takes to it\u201d. But Julaynne Trusel, a team leader in the body shop, said it beats the alternative. \u201cThe doors are staying open and everyone doesn\u2019t need to start looking for jobs, so at least it\u2019s a step in the right direction,\u201d she said. \u201cHopefully we get some more business over the life of the contract.\u201d Though there\u2019s still some frustration over the bitter fight that played out in recent years and culminated with the strike, employees don\u2019t expect any resentment to linger should the stoppage conclude. After all, the two sides were just \u201clooking out for themselves\u201d, Trusel said. \u201cThis is just business and everyone had to handle their business,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we come back together, we are going to be like one. We all want to produce the best cars that we can for our customers, so we\u2019re not going back in with a bad attitude.\u201d George Raptis, a materials department employee who has been at Detroit-Hamtramck since 1993, echoed that: \u201cWe all want to get back to work, and when we do things will go on like it\u2019s another day.\u201d The stoppage, which is the longest GM has faced since 1970, is inflicting pain on both sides. About 48,000 UAW workers, including 17,000 in Michigan, walked off the job. GM has lost more than $1.5bn because of the strike, while union workers lost more than $835m in wages, according to the East Lansing industry analyst Anderson Economic Group. Union workers are earning just $250 a week, and GM temporarily pulled their health insurance last month. \u201c$250 per week is less than my spousal payment, so I\u2019m in the hole,\u201d said a Detroit-Hamtramck body shop employee and 35-year company veteran who declined to give his name. In Flint, Jackson delayed renovations on a new house he and his wife purchased not long before the strike. \u201cYou definitely tighten up the belt and fry up a couple bologna sandwiches instead of grilling up some steaks,\u201d he said. Trusel added that support from other unions and the public helped get workers through financial difficulties. Those picketing outside the plant received free meals and donations of food, diapers, toiletries and other essentials. \u201cThere\u2019s been so much support for us. It brings you to tears to know that people care so much,\u201d Trusel said. \u201cIt\u2019s been encouraging to know that so many people are saying \u2018Stand your ground\u2019.\u201d Should the union come away with a win and public support for workers remain high, the strike could be a shot in the arm for the UAW and the largely beleaguered US labor movement. Radatz applauded leadership for \u201clocking horns with GM\u201d and said its handling of the strike so far has restored the rank and file\u2019s faith. \u201cThe union was very weak before the contract and now it\u2019s solid,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are standing with each other and they\u2019re backing each other 110%.\u201d",

One Young World\u2019s 10th annual summit will welcome young delegates from more than 190 countries as well as political and humanitarian leaders, including the former UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon, the former president of Ireland Mary Robinson, Sir Richard Branson, Sir John Major and the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau. \u201cOur young delegates are founders, activists and entrepreneurs in their own right, united by a common goal to resolve some of the world\u2019s most pressing challenges \u2013 from climate change and violent extremism to sexual violence and poverty,\u201d said Kate Robertson, a cofounder of the UK-based not-for-profit organisation.

The summit will also feature speeches from 30 global chief executives, including Alan Jope of Unilever, James Quincey of Coca Cola, Bram Schot of Audi, and Feike Sijbesma from DSM. They will be speaking to some would-be leaders of the future, among them: Madhav Datt Datt founded Green the Gene as a small environmental club in his school when he was eight years old.

As a software engineering intern at Google, Datt developed machine-learning algorithms for Nest thermostat energy demand response programs, to reduce energy used by home heating/cooling systems during peak demand times. I learned about the climate crisis at firsthand: the water level in our local dam had fallen by 2ft, which meant our water and electricity was severely rationed. There was nothing abstract about the issue for me. Starting the environmental club, planting trees and talking to local shopkeepers about plastic bags were things I couldn\u2019t not do. One of the biggest things that being young gave me was the power to go up against huge issues because I simply didn\u2019t appreciate that they were widely regarded as impossible problems. Bella Burgemeister Burgemeister was 10 when she decided to write a book to help school-aged children understand the climate crisis. The book, now in its second edition, is in every school in her community in the south-west of Western Australia. In the past three years, Burgemeister has spoken to 5,000 children and 8,000 adults in schools, conferences and meetings. She is a climate activist and organiser. It was tough, aged just 10, to get my head around things like economic growth and responsible consumption but it\u2019s important that children understand these issues because for most of my life, the major political parties have done as little as they can get away with when it comes to climate change. Young people like me are the ones who will live with the consequences of inaction on climate. That was a huge motivator for me. Some politicians and local councillors said I was too young but I didn\u2019t care: I knew what I was doing was right. Edgar Edmund Edmund founded Green Venture Recycles, a company that turns plastic waste into affordable building products, when he was 14. The Tanzanian company has already turned more than 20m plastic bags into 20,000 bricks. I was 12 when I became aware that climate change was causing the floods that regularly destroyed my community. The flood waters were always full of plastic waste. When I was 15, I had a lightbulb moment: I realised that plastic was harder after being heated, which meant I could use the plastic waste to rebuild my community\u2019s homes strong enough to withstand the floods. It was one solution to two problems. I asked myself whether I was too young to deal with this but I realised that if I had to wait for someone else to solve the problem, it would be too late. I designed my first machine using $20 of savings. It took me a year of hard work but after I\u2019d finished, I took it to a science fair and won $100. I used that money to make a more efficient machine which was nominated for a prize in South Africa. I won $15,000 in that competition and used it to create an electric machine. Then I was invited to Sweden and won $7,000 and met investors who helped me get the machine into production. Brighton Kaoma Growing up in the Zambian city of Kitwe, 12 -year-old Kaoma saw the impact of climate breakdown firsthand: as floods and droughts began to destroy his community, he found he was having to walk an extra mile to fetch water and suffered repeated respiratory infections because of the toxic emissions from nearby copper mines. When he was 14, Kaoma asked a local radio station if he could present a show on the environment. Environmental Watch became one of the station\u2019s most popular programmes, educating listeners about the problems affecting them \u2013 from global heating and deforestation to pollution \u2013 and how they could help. Now 25, Kaoma has founded Agents of Change Foundation, training young people to be agents of change in their community. It has trained 260 children so far, many taking up leadership positions in their own communities. I mobilised my community, we planted trees, I organised marches, opened conservation clubs in schools across the area. By the time I approached the radio station, they had already heard about me and my work. Being so young meant I was free-spirited: I wasn\u2019t afraid on my programme to call a spade a spade. I called to task multinationals and government. People said I was too young. They threatened me by saying my life would be affected by getting on the nerves of everyone from government to local business. But I was fearless. I was too scared of my future, living in a world with no resources other than those that had been polluted, to let them scare me. Noga Levy-Rapoport Levy-Rapoport, 17, is a core UK Student Climate Network organiser and spokeswoman for Labour for a Green New Deal. She led her first London climate strike at 16. I have aways been aware of climate change but we all grew up being told that if we recycled more and switched off the lights, we would save the planet. I realised as I got older that that\u2019s wrong. I realised that I couldn\u2019t plan my future 20 to 30 years ahead because the world was going to hit a brick wall: it would descend into chaos. Young people have so much power because we\u2019re so angry. We\u2019re growing up in climate change and amid political disasters. There\u2019s always a risk that adults will think that we will sort this out but we\u2019re really clear: we don\u2019t have time for us to grow up before a solution is found. We\u2019re very clear that it\u2019s your mess and you must clear it up. Kehkashan Basu Winner of the 2016 International Children\u2019s Peace Prize, Kehkashan Basu has been campaigning on behalf of children\u2019s rights, gender quality and climate change since she was 8 years old. When I was 8, I planted my first tree and began talking to the children and grown ups around me about environmental issues. I realised that the children were so much more responsive and enthusiastic than the adults I was speaking to, so I determined to work with children instead, informing them about environmental issues and what they could do about it. Young activists have an advantage over adults because we have an uninhibited view of the world. We\u2019re not affected by cynicism or by awareness of how big problems are. We are determined to solve problems and are truly open to new solutions. The world needs more of that attitude. This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover? Email us at theupside@theguardian.com",

      "bodyText": "Toast the Alps Though it\u2019s modest by modern standards (13 storeys and 70 metres tall), Neboti\u010dnik was the first \u201cskyscraper\u201d in Yugoslavia, and the ninth-tallest building in Europe when it opened in 1933. Architect Vladimir \u0160ubic was inspired by the art deco skyscrapers of New York, though more conservative residents dismissed it as a \u201cfreak\u201d. Today, the wraparound rooftop terrace cafe offers impressive views of the Alps to the north and Ljubljana Castle, just a few blocks away. Access is via a lobby clad in black marble and a spiral staircase. At the top, you can enjoy Slovenian wines \u2013 try Rebula, a buttery white, still or sparkling. Hipster heaven Ljubljana is no stranger to topiaried beards and artful tattoos, and you can explore its alternative side by strolling down Trubarjeva ulica, where Trubarjeva Antikvariat sells pieces of Yugo-nostalgia, such as busts and portraits of Tito, or industrial-design classics like the sleek, Lamborghini-red ETA 85 rotary telephone designed in 1979 by Davorin Savnik and made by Iskra. Reminiscent of a race car, this phone was produced in the millions and was a staple on the walls of Yugoslav homes \u2013 today one is on display at New York\u2019s Museum of Modern Art. Countercultural haven For clubbing, the Metelkova district is graffiti-laden but entirely safe and welcoming. Once a complex of barracks for the Austro-Hungarian and, later, Yugoslav armies, it is now home to bars, nightclubs and a former prison-turned-hostel. Its new life began as a squatters\u2019 settlement on 25 June 1991, the day Slovenia declared independence from Yugoslavia. In 2005, Metelkova became part of a national cultural heritage list, but it remains on the edge of the law \u2013 raising its own funds, largely through concerts \u2013 and is the best place to go for friendly, alternative nightlife. World-class cuisine JB, a restaurant on the ground floor of a Ple\u010dnik building (see below) that resembles a modernised Greek temple, has been the epitome of fine dining in the region since the 1990s. World renowned chef Janez Bratov\u017e was the first to introduce dishes such as fish carpaccio and rare steak to a culinary culture that was used to well-done cutlets in cream sauce. Not long ago, he served his signature ravioli with pistachio, chestnut, pear and foie gras to Ferran Adri\u00e0 and the pope (though not at the same event). Michelin does not yet have a guide to Slovenia, though it\u2019s rumoured to be in the pipeline \u2013 and JB will surely be up for a star. It is reasonably priced for a restaurant of that level: the six-course fish or meat menu is \u20ac60 and the vegetarian version \u20ac50; the 12-course tasting menu is \u20ac95. \u2022 jb-slo.com Street food On Fridays from March until the end of October, the central market features a huge outdoor food fair called Odprta Kuhna (Open Kitchen), which can draw as many as 25,000 people. Founded by Israeli expat Lior Kochavy, it is the best way to sample a wide variety of specialities, as dozens of restaurants, from fancy to down-home, set up stands and offer food truck-style dishes. This is where you can try JB\u2019s take on a burger made with dry-aged brisket (\u20ac6); a pulled duck and red cabbage sandwich \u2013 a street twist on a popular St Martin\u2019s Day meal; and \u0161morn, an Austro-Hungarian shredded pancake topped with comp\u00f4te (\u20ac3). For the most Slovenian of snacks, try Klobasarna, behind the cathedral, which offers only Carniolian sausage, a geographically protected local pork sausage served with a pot of mustard and a warm roll (half \u20ac3.50, whole \u20ac5.90). This is probably the only speciality sausage to have been consumed in space, as an American astronaut with Slovenian roots, Sunita Williams, took some to the International Space Station. A Kanye-inspired tour In November 2018, Kanye West tweeted to his 29 million followers about a rather obscure Slovenian modernist architect called Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik (1872-1957). Kanye and architectural historians agree on Ple\u010dnik\u2019s brilliance, and Ljubljana is the place to see his work.

Take a guided tour or do one yourself, beginning at his ivy-clad home, which is now a museum, Ple\u010dnikova Hi\u0161a. A stroll past Ple\u010dnik buildings will take you through the most interesting spots in the city, crisscrossing the river via its many bridges, from the Cobblers\u2019 Bridge, lined with columns that support nothing, to the Triple Bridge, based on Venice\u2019s Rialto but with three separate bridges at slight angles to one another (one for pedestrians, one for cyclists, one for cars, and with one of the first public toilets in Europe hidden underneath). And on to the Dragon Bridge, the most photographed site in the city, with plinths on its four corners crowned with bronze, bat-winged dragons. Surreal shopping A stroll through Tr\u017enice, the central market, designed by Ple\u010dnik, should begin at Marjetka\u2019s sauerkraut stand.

For backpackers or younger travellers there\u2019s the uber-hip Celica Hostel (beds from \u20ac24), a converted prison in Metelkova. Or Samostan Mekinje, a medieval monastery in Kamnik, is a 40-minute train ride from Ljubljana centre and has beds from \u20ac15. When to visit In recent years Ljubljana has become overcrowded in the summer, so aim for any time other than high season \u2013 May and September are particularly lovely. Average prices A half-litre glass of beer costs around \u20ac2; an espresso coffee is around \u20ac1.20; a three-course meal is \u20ac20 to \u20ac30. Getting there London to Ljubljana by train takes 18 to 23 hours. See The Man in Seat 61 website for details.

      "body": "<h2>Top story: Critical day in Commons as PM tries to push through deal</h2> \n<p>Good morning and welcome to this Monday briefing with Alison Rourke.</p> \n<p>After a weekend that promised more Brexit action than it delivered, many in Westminster and beyond will be hoping that the coming days provide more clarity. Today the PM is expected to try to win parliamentary backing for his deal in a straight yes or no vote in the Commons, in the hope that MPs will sign off on the withdrawal agreement before there is the chance to scrutinise the full legislation and attach amendments. But Labour has another plan: overnight it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/20/labour-seeks-new-alliance-to-kill-off-boris-johnsons-brexit-deal\">declared that it would seek the backing of rebel Tories and the DUP</a> for amendments that would force Johnson to drop the deal \u2013 or accept a softer Brexit. Some of what happens today will hinge on whether the Speaker, John Bercow, will allow another \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d, because Johnson tried and failed to get it done on Saturday. No 10 will resist any amendments to the Brexit legislation, arguing that the current offer from the EU is the only one on the table and that \u201cwrecking amendments\u201d could torpedo the fragile coalition that it is trying to assemble for a deal.</p> \n<p>Our guide to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/20/what-next-for-boris-johnson-brexit-deal-withdrawal-bill-vote\">what next for Brexit</a> sets out the potential paths ahead. The PM claims <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/20/boris-johnson-brexit-deal-knife-edge-despite-claim-he-has-the-numbers\">he has the numbers </a>to get his way, including all of his 287 voting MPs (including his brother Jo), about 20 former Tories who left the party or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/03/hammond-clashes-with-johnson-in-run-up-to-commons-showdown\">had the whip suspended</a>, and about eight Labour MPs.

Data from the King\u2019s College London study, to be published in full next month, shows the extra strain on the NHS on those days, including 120 more cardiac arrests, 230 more strokes and 200 more people needing asthma treatment. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the climate emergency is in fact also a health emergency,\u201d said the NHS chief executive, Simon Stevens. Previous studies have found <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/10/air-pollution-linked-to-spikes-in-hospital-and-gp-visits\">spikes in hospital admissions</a> and GP visits on days of high pollution, but the new data gives precise numbers for nine English cities and shows a clear relationship between heart attacks, strokes and respiratory illnesses and dirty air.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Christmas recycling </strong>\u2013 John Lewis and Waitrose<a href=\"https://preview.gutools.co.uk/business/waitrose\"> </a>are to stop selling crackers containing plastic toys and puzzles as part of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/21/waitrose-to-stop-selling-plastic-toys-in-christmas-crackers-from-2020\">drive to reduce single-use plastics</a> \u2013 but not until 2020. Today they will announce a switch to recyclable materials such as metal and paper. John Lewis has also joined the wider crackdown on glitter (some of which contain microplastics) by reducing the amount used to decorate its own-brand range of Christmas wrapping paper, gift bags and tags, advent calendars and crackers by two-thirds.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Northern Ireland abortion rights protest</strong> \u2013Members of mothballed Stormont assembly are due to return to the chamber today for the first time in almost three years to protest against the extension of abortion rights to Northern Ireland. The DUP and other anti-abortion members will stage what is expected to be a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/21/dup-stormont-protest-against-abortion-rights\">largely symbolic recall of the assembly.</a> The region\u2019s near-blanket ban on abortion is due to end at midnight tonight after a historic vote in the House of Commons last July to bring Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the UK.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Renewable expansion</strong> \u2013 Global supplies of renewable electricity are growing faster than expected and could<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/21/renewable-energy-to-expand-by-50-in-next-five-years-report\"> expand by 50% in the next five years</a>, powered by a resurgence in solar energy. The International Energy Agency has found solar, wind and hydropower projects are rolling out at their fastest rate in four years. Its latest report predicts that by 2024 the world\u2019s solar capacity could have grown by 600GW, almost double the installed total electricity capacity of Japan. The cost of solar power is also expected to decline by a further 15% by 2024.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>\u2018Don\u2019t be a dick\u2019 </strong>\u2013 Hillary Clinton has been trolling Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/1186008390926917632\">tweeting</a> a mocked-up letter from John F Kennedy to Nikita Khrushchev, which was intended to<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/20/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-letter-erdogan-parody-kennedy-khrushchev\"> ridicule a real letter from Trump to the Turkish leader</a>, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/17/unplugged-and-unleashed-what-the-letter-to-recep-tayyip-erdogan-tells-us-about-donald-trump\">revealed publicly last week</a>. \u201cFound in the archives,\u201d Clinton wrote, over an image of what purported to be a letter from the US president to the Soviet leader on 16 October 1962, during the Cuban missile crisis. \u201cDear Premier Khrushchev,\u201d the \u201cletter\u201d began, \u201cDon\u2019t be a dick, OK?

It ends before his marriage to fellow comedian Dawn French in 1984. To write it, Henry opened up a \u201cpandora\u2019s box\u201d of memories and then started, as he puts it, \u201cto vomit out the chapters\u201d. He turned violence at home into a live performance that would eventually help him to buy his mother (who died in 1998) a home. He used his comedy to ward off bellicose bullies and honed his short impressions sets in sometimes hostile working men\u2019s clubs. At 61, and arguably Britain\u2019s best known comic, Henry continues to push back against racism: \u201cWhen, in 100 years\u2019 time, we look back at the way things change, we\u2019ll go: \u2018Wow, that was a snap of a finger.\u2019 But when you\u2019re in the middle of it, change is long.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Critical day in Commons as PM tries to push through deal Good morning and welcome to this Monday briefing with Alison Rourke. After a weekend that promised more Brexit action than it delivered, many in Westminster and beyond will be hoping that the coming days provide more clarity. Today the PM is expected to try to win parliamentary backing for his deal in a straight yes or no vote in the Commons, in the hope that MPs will sign off on the withdrawal agreement before there is the chance to scrutinise the full legislation and attach amendments. But Labour has another plan: overnight it declared that it would seek the backing of rebel Tories and the DUP for amendments that would force Johnson to drop the deal \u2013 or accept a softer Brexit. Some of what happens today will hinge on whether the Speaker, John Bercow, will allow another \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d, because Johnson tried and failed to get it done on Saturday. No 10 will resist any amendments to the Brexit legislation, arguing that the current offer from the EU is the only one on the table and that \u201cwrecking amendments\u201d could torpedo the fragile coalition that it is trying to assemble for a deal. Our guide to what next for Brexit sets out the potential paths ahead. The PM claims he has the numbers to get his way, including all of his 287 voting MPs (including his brother Jo), about 20 former Tories who left the party or had the whip suspended, and about eight Labour MPs. You can read the papers\u2019 opposing stances on Brexit here, but it\u2019s a brave person who would predict with any certainty exactly what may happen over the next few days. * * * Air pollution \u2013 Scores of people are being rushed to hospital for emergency treatment on days of high pollution in cities across England, including for heart attacks and strokes. Data from the King\u2019s College London study, to be published in full next month, shows the extra strain on the NHS on those days, including 120 more cardiac arrests, 230 more strokes and 200 more people needing asthma treatment. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the climate emergency is in fact also a health emergency,\u201d said the NHS chief executive, Simon Stevens. Previous studies have found spikes in hospital admissions and GP visits on days of high pollution, but the new data gives precise numbers for nine English cities and shows a clear relationship between heart attacks, strokes and respiratory illnesses and dirty air. * * * Christmas recycling \u2013 John Lewis and Waitrose are to stop selling crackers containing plastic toys and puzzles as part of a drive to reduce single-use plastics \u2013 but not until 2020. Today they will announce a switch to recyclable materials such as metal and paper. John Lewis has also joined the wider crackdown on glitter (some of which contain microplastics) by reducing the amount used to decorate its own-brand range of Christmas wrapping paper, gift bags and tags, advent calendars and crackers by two-thirds. * * * Northern Ireland abortion rights protest \u2013Members of mothballed Stormont assembly are due to return to the chamber today for the first time in almost three years to protest against the extension of abortion rights to Northern Ireland. The DUP and other anti-abortion members will stage what is expected to be a largely symbolic recall of the assembly. The region\u2019s near-blanket ban on abortion is due to end at midnight tonight after a historic vote in the House of Commons last July to bring Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the UK. * * * Renewable expansion \u2013 Global supplies of renewable electricity are growing faster than expected and could expand by 50% in the next five years, powered by a resurgence in solar energy. The International Energy Agency has found solar, wind and hydropower projects are rolling out at their fastest rate in four years. Its latest report predicts that by 2024 the world\u2019s solar capacity could have grown by 600GW, almost double the installed total electricity capacity of Japan. The cost of solar power is also expected to decline by a further 15% by 2024. * * * \u2018Don\u2019t be a dick\u2019 \u2013 Hillary Clinton has been trolling Donald Trump, tweeting a mocked-up letter from John F Kennedy to Nikita Khrushchev, which was intended to ridicule a real letter from Trump to the Turkish leader, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, revealed publicly last week. \u201cFound in the archives,\u201d Clinton wrote, over an image of what purported to be a letter from the US president to the Soviet leader on 16 October 1962, during the Cuban missile crisis. \u201cDear Premier Khrushchev,\u201d the \u201cletter\u201d began, \u201cDon\u2019t be a dick, OK? Get your missiles out of Cuba \u2026 if you don\u2019t everyone will be like \u2018what an asshole\u2019 and call your garbage country \u2018The Soviet Bunion\u2019\u201d. Trump\u2019s letter to Erdo\u011fan, in which he urged the authoritarian Turkish president who has invaded northern Syria \u201cDon\u2019t be a tough guy. Don\u2019t be a fool!\u201d, met with widespread disbelief, not least for its strikingly unpresidential tone. Today in Focus podcast: How did a town in West Virginia become the opioid capital of the US? Chris McGreal reports on the web of doctors, pharmacists and drug companies that made rural Mingo county, West Virginia, the opioid capital of America. And: Emma Barnett on why we need to be better at talking about periods. Lunchtime read: Lenny Henry: \u2018I wish somebody had taught me how to defend myself\u2019 Lenny Henry\u2019s childhood was defined by racist abuse and his mother\u2019s violence. But his new autobiography, Who am I, Again? is also about bearing witness to the time of his early years in Dudley. \u201cI grew up in a period where, just down the road in Smethwick, a Tory politician got in with the slogan \u2018If you want a nigger for a neighbour vote Labour\u2019,\u201d he tells Lanre Bakare, referring to Peter Griffiths\u2019s notorious 1964 election win for the Conservatives. The book ranges from his infancy to until he was a few years into his nascent career. It ends before his marriage to fellow comedian Dawn French in 1984. To write it, Henry opened up a \u201cpandora\u2019s box\u201d of memories and then started, as he puts it, \u201cto vomit out the chapters\u201d. He turned violence at home into a live performance that would eventually help him to buy his mother (who died in 1998) a home. He used his comedy to ward off bellicose bullies and honed his short impressions sets in sometimes hostile working men\u2019s clubs. At 61, and arguably Britain\u2019s best known comic, Henry continues to push back against racism: \u201cWhen, in 100 years\u2019 time, we look back at the way things change, we\u2019ll go: \u2018Wow, that was a snap of a finger.\u2019 But when you\u2019re in the middle of it, change is long. And I think that\u2019s the problem. Things aren\u2019t happening fast enough.\u201d Sport Wales refused to buckle under intense pressure in their Rugby World Cup win over France, which bodes well for their next outing against South Africa, who ended Japan\u2019s campaign after grinding down the host nation in the other quarter-final. Eddie Jones has told England they stand on the brink of greatness after setting up a semi-final against the \u201cbeatable\u201d All Blacks on Saturday. Winger Jack Nowell is expected to be fit and available for selection for the game in Yokohama. J\u00fcrgen Klopp railed at the VAR outcome over a \u201cclear foul\u201d in the buildup to Marcus Rashford\u2019s goal as Liverpool surrendered their 100% record in a 1-1 draw at Manchester United. Pep Guardiola has claimed Manchester City are \u201cstill not ready\u201d to win the Champions League because they are not clinical enough in front of goal. Katie Zelem and Jess Sigsworth fired United to a League Cup win over City in a Manchester derby. A tearful Andy Murray defeated Stan Wawrinka in three sets to lift the European Open in Antwerp, his first singles title since March 2017. And the ECB\u2019s Hundred has taken its first steps in an engaging piece of contrived TV theatre when eight franchises handed out playing contracts. Business The former governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, has warned the world economy is sleeping walking into a new financial crisis that will have devastating consequences for the democratic market system. Lord King, who was in charge at Threadneedle Street during the near-death of the global banking system and deep economic slump a decade ago, said the resistance to new thinking meant a repeat of the chaos of the 2008-09 period was looming. Giving a lecture in Washington at the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund, King said there had been no fundamental questioning of the ideas that led to the crisis of a decade ago. \u201cAnother economic and financial crisis would be devastating to the legitimacy of a democratic market system,\u201d he said. \u201cBy sticking to the new orthodoxy of monetary policy and pretending that we have made the banking system safe, we are sleepwalking towards that crisis.\u201d Continuing uncertainty over Brexit has pushed the pound down from a five-month high against the dollar and the euro. It\u2019s buying $1.291 and \u20ac1.157. The papers The papers almost all focus on the prospect of a new vote on the prime minister\u2019s Brexit deal today.

The Sun\u2019s lead story is \u201cBad blood brothers\u201d, about comments made by Prince Harry that he and his brother are \u201con different paths\u201d and the Mirror leads on an investigation into working conditions at Amazon\u2019s biggest UK warehouse: \u201cTreated like slaves\u201d.

Scarborough, the largest resort on the Yorkshire coast, ranked second out of 347 local authorities in England and Wales for personal insolvencies, while Torbay in Devon \u2013 which includes the town of Torquay \u2013 came third, said the accountancy firm UHY Hacker Young. Plymouth, on the south coast of Devon, was ranked fourth, while Blackpool was in sixth place. However, it was the city of Stoke-on-Trent in the Midlands which had the highest rate of personal insolvencies, recording just over 51 per 10,000 adults in 2018. The national average was 25, said the firm. The insolvency rate includes personal bankruptcies, debt relief orders and individual voluntary arrangements. UHY Hacker Young said the data suggested many of the locations \u201care still a long way from recovering from the decades of contraction in their traditional coastal industries such as tourism, shipbuilding and fishing\u201d. It added that the slump in sterling and the resulting rise in the numbers of people taking staycation holidays had apparently had little tangible impact on traditional holiday destinations such as Scarborough and Blackpool. Scarborough had 47.8 insolvencies per 10,000 adults, while Torbay had 45.7, and Plymouth had 45.2.

Another line from the poem, \u201cWhen home won\u2019t let you stay,\u201d is the title of a new exhibition opening 23 October at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston. Featuring 40 artworks created by 20 key artists, When Home Won\u2019t Let You Stay: Migration Through Contemporary Art looks at how displacement, migration and immigration has inspired the works of artists over the past 20 years. The pieces tell some of the stories of the 70.8 million people have been forcibly displaced worldwide, according to a United Nations Refugee Agency statistic. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a survey on the complicated topic of migration, displacement and immigration of people,\u201d said co-curator Eva Respini. \u201cInstead, we wanted to have a focused look through this moment right now. It\u2019s a signpost of these ideas always through the lens of art and artists.\u201d The first thing viewers see upon entering the exhibition is Woven Chronicle, an artwork by Indian artist Reena Saini Kallat, created between the years 2011 and 2016. It\u2019s a wall map made of yarn, tracking the global routes where migrants have traveled; from contract workers to refugees and asylum seekers. Though the artwork was completed in 2016, the artist keeps updating it to trace new routes. \u201cOver the years, I\u2019ve tried to incorporate changes by updating the research,\u201d said Kallat, who has updated the map with the territorial split between Sudan and South Sudan. \u201cEven though the work is not meant to be an illustration of the numbers of refugees, as we have more data coming in, I keep trying to update the information we have in the archives,\u201d she adds. The Kurdish artist Hayv Kahraman is showing Bab el Sheikh from 2013, an oil on wood wall piece showing a person either descending or ascending a staircase. As a refugee who left Iraq as a child, then moved through Europe and then the US, it\u2019s what co-curator Ruth Erickson calls \u201ca memory of home, reflecting on her own experience as a refugee\u201d. The Palestinian artist Mona Hatoum is showing Exodus II from 2002, a sculpture that connects a pair of suitcases with strands of hair, suggesting separation from familial roots. Also on view are landscape photographs by the California-based artist Richard Misrach, who documented the 2,000-mile border between the US and Mexico for his series Border Cantos from 2004 to 2016. The Irish artist Richard Mosse is showing a three-channel video called Incoming, which was created between 2014 and 2017. \u201cIt tracks the route of refugees from North Africa and Middle East to Europe, mostly over water, landing on shores of southern Europe and making their way through refugee camps,\u201d said Respini. One of the most recurrent images in the exhibition is the sea. \u201cThe site of the sea, the migration route and the refugee camp all play a role here,\u201d said Erickson. The Moroccan artist Yto Barrada is showing works from her series, A Life Full of Holes: The Strait Project, which the artist created between 1998 and 2003.

These remain cities divided.</p> \n<p>The rich of Johannesburg still live in the sumptuous northern suburbs, where the food at some restaurants is Michelin-star quality and house prices are eye-watering. These areas remain largely white, although that is changing at a glacial pace. The workers are in Soweto and Alexandra and other poor, crime-plagued black enclaves. It has always been this way with Johannesburg, and it remains pretty much as divided 25 years after apartheid collapsed and 29 years after Nelson Mandela walked out of prison. </p> \n<p>This economic powerhouse is Africa\u2019s city of dreams \u2013 and nightmares. Its population of nearly 10 million are drawn from all corners of South Africa and increasingly from Zimbabwe, Nigeria, Malawi and Bangladesh.

This is because it is the child of gold, not trade. Just a patchwork of farms when gold was discovered in 1884, it swiftly transformed into a chaotic, violent concatenation of settlements that attracted white adventurers, gold diggers (literal and figurative), sex workers, settlers, criminals, shysters, black labourers and elites from around the globe \u2013 all looking to make a fortune.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fa4cf32fa1f02925a90b7ddb77cf61dded09fb61\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa4cf32fa1f02925a90b7ddb77cf61dded09fb61/0_0_1992_1195/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People queue to cast their votes at a polling station in Soweto in April 1994, in South Africa\u2019s first all-race elections.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People queue to cast their votes at a polling station in Soweto in April 1994, in South Africa\u2019s first all-race elections.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Denis Farrell/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It mutated into a frontier town and grew in a colonial fashion \u2013 blacks and whites remained largely separate, with the white mine-owners building mansions that sprawled into rich northern suburbs while black people were pushed to the south into townships.</p> \n<p>Apartheid formalised the loose colonial arrangement in the 1940s, creating a black labour reserve named Soweto (from South Western Townships) and banishing black people from the city while forcing them to carry a <em>dompas</em> (permit) at all times to show cause to be there. For 46 years from the formal introduction of apartheid in 1948 until its demise in 1994, this was the architecture of apartheid Johannesburg. Separate and unequal; black and white; rich and poor.</p> \n<p>Then 1994 happened. Mandela and his party, the ANC, were installed in office. Hopes for a new South Africa and a new Johannesburg \u2013 integrated, non-racial and free of the divisions of the past \u2013 were high. Spatial apartheid would be done away with thanks to creative and determined urban planning.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f22f1510d14c387507b3ae3e2c9fc41d6d2fa48\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f22f1510d14c387507b3ae3e2c9fc41d6d2fa48/0_111_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Maboneng development zone in Johannesburg in 2013.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Maboneng development zone in Johannesburg in 2013.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It has not quite happened. In my neighbourhood of Parkview, a tree-lined middle-class suburb in the jacaranda tree shadow of the \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randlord\">Randlords</a>\u2019\u201d mansions in Westcliff, mine remains one of woefully few black families. Even with the explosive rise of the black middle class in the mid-2000s, the presence of black people in formerly white suburbs across Johannesburg remains low.</p> \n<p>There is a reason for this glacial pace of change. Johannesburg is a microcosm of South Africa. The World Bank said in May 2018 that South Africa remains <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/07/africa/south-africa-elections-inequality-intl/index.html\">the most economically unequal country in the world</a>. Poverty levels are highest among black people. Whites make up the majority of the elite or top 5% of the population. Hence the stubbornness of spatial segregation.</p> \n<p>After the collapse of apartheid, Mandela and his new team vowed to provide housing, water, electricity and other amenities to the previously disadvantaged. They didn\u2019t expect to get such a huge influx of new residents into the cities. Since 1994, millions of people have set up shacks on the peripheries of townships and cities across the country.</p> \n<p>The response has been to rush to these unplanned new peripheral areas \u2013 some built on dangerous river banks \u2013 and build formal, though tiny, houses. The result is massive new low-cost housing units on the peripheries of cities and very little or no deliberate urban planning that leads to integrated housing solutions. The rich stay in the rich suburbs while the poor join other poor people on the periphery.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"224379e04c53516a1544b048d8914dbcdaeb8af0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/224379e04c53516a1544b048d8914dbcdaeb8af0/0_0_4000_2670/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A pedestrian passes by a residential construction project in Maboneng.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A pedestrian passes by a residential construction project in Maboneng.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Hopes for the future</h2> \n<p>It doesn\u2019t mean that there is no change. In 2016 the government statistician published a series of maps that illustrate Johannesburg is the most integrated city out of its six major metros. Encouraging as that picture is, it is also problematic. The Johannesburg central business district has a high percentage of black African residents \u2013 but the past 20 years have been characterised by \u201cwhite flight\u201d into the northern suburbs. Johannesburg\u2019s townships, like Soweto, remain largely disconnected from business districts and formerly white suburbs, despite initiatives such as bus rapid transit to make it easier for Soweto residents to get to work in formerly white areas.</p> \n<p>Even more hopeful is the decision this February by the city of Johannesburg to adopt a first-of-its-kind inclusionary housing policy that compels private developers to make 30% of the homes in all future residential developments affordable, regardless of where they are built. Implemented properly, it could be a game-changer for the city.</p> \n<p>Many of my favourite parts of Johannesburg have been facilitated by the Johannesburg Development Agency, together with a handful of savvy and brave private developers. The Newtown Cultural Precinct in the CBD is a fine example, incorporating commercial developments and sleek affordable housing.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Johannesburg's new policy to make 30% of homes in future developments affordable could be a game-changer for the city</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Possibly the trendiest part of the old Joburg CBD is Maboneng, a collection of 55 buildings bought and restored by the JDA in partnership with entrepreneur Jonathan Liebmann. The company Liebmann founded <a href=\"https://www.biznews.com/sa-investing/2019/04/23/joburg-maboneng-wrong\">collapsed earlier this year</a>, with units being auctioned off at way below estimated market value to bargain-hunters. But it is still a hive of restaurants, hotels, residential flats and a major artistic hub, with international artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/10/out-of-south-africa-how-politics-animated-the-art-of-william-kentridge\">William Kentridge</a> as a tenant. However there are others springing up all over town.</p> \n<p>Yet Johannesburg\u2019s fortunes are intricately intertwined with South Africa\u2019s \u2013 and the country has gone through a turbulent 10 years under the leadership of ousted former president Jacob Zuma. Now led by former trade unionist and businessman Cyril Ramaphosa, the country is battling to deal with the corruption that thrived under Zuma. Ramaphosa says all the right things, as he did in London this week, but internal ANC politics stop him from introducing vigorous economic reforms to kickstart the economy in a country where unemployment is now just under 30% and government finances are deteriorating rapidly.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/oct/21/waving-not-drowning-the-street-children-finding-refuge-in-durbans-surf-scene-photo-essay\">Waving not drowning: the street children finding refuge in Durban's surf scene</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Young people are restless and are becoming increasingly disillusioned with politics. The number of South Africans under 20 who registered to participate in May\u2019s general election was the lowest since at least 1999, data from the Independent Electoral Commission showed. Among citizens aged 18 to 29 \u2013 the biggest segment of the voting population \u2013 registrations are <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-30/youth-voters-at-20-year-low-as-south-africa-protests-beat-polls\">at their lowest in at least a decade</a>. </p> \n<p>The frustration of youth is palpable. Every morning traffic reports warn of protests by young people blocking major roads with burning tyres and rocks to demand services and jobs. It is a ticking timebomb.</p> \n<p>Yet there is a sense in South Africa that things can be turned around. That would give our cities a shot at becoming more inclusive, more liveable and more human.</p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Justice Malala </em><em>is an award-winning journalist, television host, political commentator and newspaper columnist.

      "bodyText": "It doesn\u2019t take long after I drive out of the sleek OR Tambo international airport for the penny to drop. Again. Johannesburg is the bastard child of the worst aspects of capitalist greed and 20th-century racism. Nearly 150 years after its formation, this sprawling metropolis is still scarred by the sins of its genesis. Johannesburg \u2013 like Cape Town, Durban, Port Elizabeth and other cities in South Africa \u2013 is visibly and traumatically segregated. These remain cities divided. The rich of Johannesburg still live in the sumptuous northern suburbs, where the food at some restaurants is Michelin-star quality and house prices are eye-watering. These areas remain largely white, although that is changing at a glacial pace. The workers are in Soweto and Alexandra and other poor, crime-plagued black enclaves. It has always been this way with Johannesburg, and it remains pretty much as divided 25 years after apartheid collapsed and 29 years after Nelson Mandela walked out of prison. This economic powerhouse is Africa\u2019s city of dreams \u2013 and nightmares. Its population of nearly 10 million are drawn from all corners of South Africa and increasingly from Zimbabwe, Nigeria, Malawi and Bangladesh. The city remains a magnet for those hoping for a better life. It is unique as the only major city in the world not built by the seaside or on the banks of a major river. This is because it is the child of gold, not trade. Just a patchwork of farms when gold was discovered in 1884, it swiftly transformed into a chaotic, violent concatenation of settlements that attracted white adventurers, gold diggers (literal and figurative), sex workers, settlers, criminals, shysters, black labourers and elites from around the globe \u2013 all looking to make a fortune. It mutated into a frontier town and grew in a colonial fashion \u2013 blacks and whites remained largely separate, with the white mine-owners building mansions that sprawled into rich northern suburbs while black people were pushed to the south into townships. Apartheid formalised the loose colonial arrangement in the 1940s, creating a black labour reserve named Soweto (from South Western Townships) and banishing black people from the city while forcing them to carry a dompas (permit) at all times to show cause to be there. For 46 years from the formal introduction of apartheid in 1948 until its demise in 1994, this was the architecture of apartheid Johannesburg. Separate and unequal; black and white; rich and poor. Then 1994 happened. Mandela and his party, the ANC, were installed in office. Hopes for a new South Africa and a new Johannesburg \u2013 integrated, non-racial and free of the divisions of the past \u2013 were high. Spatial apartheid would be done away with thanks to creative and determined urban planning. It has not quite happened. In my neighbourhood of Parkview, a tree-lined middle-class suburb in the jacaranda tree shadow of the \u201cRandlords\u2019\u201d mansions in Westcliff, mine remains one of woefully few black families. Even with the explosive rise of the black middle class in the mid-2000s, the presence of black people in formerly white suburbs across Johannesburg remains low. There is a reason for this glacial pace of change. Johannesburg is a microcosm of South Africa. The World Bank said in May 2018 that South Africa remains the most economically unequal country in the world. Poverty levels are highest among black people. Whites make up the majority of the elite or top 5% of the population. Hence the stubbornness of spatial segregation. After the collapse of apartheid, Mandela and his new team vowed to provide housing, water, electricity and other amenities to the previously disadvantaged. They didn\u2019t expect to get such a huge influx of new residents into the cities. Since 1994, millions of people have set up shacks on the peripheries of townships and cities across the country. The response has been to rush to these unplanned new peripheral areas \u2013 some built on dangerous river banks \u2013 and build formal, though tiny, houses. The result is massive new low-cost housing units on the peripheries of cities and very little or no deliberate urban planning that leads to integrated housing solutions. The rich stay in the rich suburbs while the poor join other poor people on the periphery. Hopes for the future It doesn\u2019t mean that there is no change. In 2016 the government statistician published a series of maps that illustrate Johannesburg is the most integrated city out of its six major metros. Encouraging as that picture is, it is also problematic. The Johannesburg central business district has a high percentage of black African residents \u2013 but the past 20 years have been characterised by \u201cwhite flight\u201d into the northern suburbs. Johannesburg\u2019s townships, like Soweto, remain largely disconnected from business districts and formerly white suburbs, despite initiatives such as bus rapid transit to make it easier for Soweto residents to get to work in formerly white areas. Even more hopeful is the decision this February by the city of Johannesburg to adopt a first-of-its-kind inclusionary housing policy that compels private developers to make 30% of the homes in all future residential developments affordable, regardless of where they are built. Implemented properly, it could be a game-changer for the city. Many of my favourite parts of Johannesburg have been facilitated by the Johannesburg Development Agency, together with a handful of savvy and brave private developers. The Newtown Cultural Precinct in the CBD is a fine example, incorporating commercial developments and sleek affordable housing. Possibly the trendiest part of the old Joburg CBD is Maboneng, a collection of 55 buildings bought and restored by the JDA in partnership with entrepreneur Jonathan Liebmann. The company Liebmann founded collapsed earlier this year, with units being auctioned off at way below estimated market value to bargain-hunters. But it is still a hive of restaurants, hotels, residential flats and a major artistic hub, with international artist William Kentridge as a tenant. However there are others springing up all over town. Yet Johannesburg\u2019s fortunes are intricately intertwined with South Africa\u2019s \u2013 and the country has gone through a turbulent 10 years under the leadership of ousted former president Jacob Zuma. Now led by former trade unionist and businessman Cyril Ramaphosa, the country is battling to deal with the corruption that thrived under Zuma. Ramaphosa says all the right things, as he did in London this week, but internal ANC politics stop him from introducing vigorous economic reforms to kickstart the economy in a country where unemployment is now just under 30% and government finances are deteriorating rapidly. Young people are restless and are becoming increasingly disillusioned with politics. The number of South Africans under 20 who registered to participate in May\u2019s general election was the lowest since at least 1999, data from the Independent Electoral Commission showed. Among citizens aged 18 to 29 \u2013 the biggest segment of the voting population \u2013 registrations are at their lowest in at least a decade. The frustration of youth is palpable. Every morning traffic reports warn of protests by young people blocking major roads with burning tyres and rocks to demand services and jobs. It is a ticking timebomb. Yet there is a sense in South Africa that things can be turned around. That would give our cities a shot at becoming more inclusive, more liveable and more human. \u2022 Justice Malala is an award-winning journalist, television host, political commentator and newspaper columnist.

      "bodyText": "Marcelliano Reitz, lean and toothless, rolls up his sleeve. The sun is setting behind the world-famous silhouette of Table Mountain. A plane on its way to Cape Town\u2019s international airport flies low overhead. Children play on a rusting climbing frame, jumping on an abandoned mattress. Reitz has only just returned to his home in the poor and violent neighbourhood of Bonteheuwel after five years in jail for a firearms offence. He is a member of the Americans, one of the area\u2019s biggest and most violent criminal gangs. On his wrist is the tattoo that marks him out as also being a member of one of South Africa\u2019s major prison gangs. Yards away, police search a line of teenagers turned to a wall. \u201cThis is our territory,\u201d says Reitz, 34. \u201cLife is tough here but we have no problem with the police. They keep it stable. That is better for everyone.\u201d The police deployment in Bonteheuwel is part of a new effort by local authorities to stem soaring rates of violent crime on the Cape Flats, a vast sprawl inland of Cape Town that feels a world away from the beaches, restaurants and tourist sites on the other side of the mountain. Few doubt the scale of the problem. Bonteheuwel in the Cape Flats \u201cIt\u2019s been a bad year \u2013 but a really bad five years,\u201d says Simone Haysom, author of a book on gang violence in Cape Town. \u201cUntil now, the government seems to have been willing to let the Cape Flats burn.\u201d After almost 1,000 murders in the first six months of this year alone on the Cape Flats, national authorities sent in the army, and armoured convoys have patrolled the rutted streets of the area\u2019s worst neighbourhoods of the Cape Flats since July. The deployment was extended by South Africa\u2019s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, in September. The police patrolling in Bonteheuwel are from one of two freshly constituted units of Cape Town\u2019s Metro force that are dispatched to some of the worst areas. \u201cThe community is tired of the gangs, and criminals think twice if they see us in the area,\u201d says the inspector who leads the team. Through the evening and night, he and his dozen officers, all recruited locally, will stop and search a score of teenagers, raid a shattered, destitute house used solely by local drug addicts and search for firearms in squalid huts. Walls in the neighbourhood are marked with graffiti showing which gang is in control of each block. Bonteheuwel was constructed in the 1960s by the repressive, racist apartheid regime that ruled South Africa until 1994. Apartheid planners purged Cape Town of black and mixed-race communities, dumping them in townships built without amenities or transport links on the sandy Cape Flats. Gangs developed rapidly from the mid-1990s onwards, recruiting among unemployed youth. Street scenes in Nyanga As violent crime has risen across South Africa since 2011, so too has gang violence on the Cape Flats. \u201cThere are more criminal networks in South Africa now, more foreign networks and more criminal businesses,\u201d says Haysom. Statistics released in September show a total of 21,022 murder cases in South Africa reported between 1 April 2018 and 31 March this year, a 3.4% increase from the previous reporting period, leaving the country with one of the highest murder rates in the world. The worst police precinct in the country, Nyanga, is close to Bonteheuwel. There has been a large reduction in gang violence in Bonteheuwel Cape Town is run by South Africa\u2019s main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, further complicating the fight against gang violence. DA officials accuse the African National Congress, in power at national level for 25 years, of starving the province of police resources. Albert Fritz, provincial minister for community safety, says violence on the Cape Flats has been very localised. \u201cIt is really a tale of two cities,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can be a tourist in the centre of Cape Town [and] you will be totally safe. You will not know that \u2026 10km [6.2 miles] away there are people shooting at police.\u201d So far, the new deployment to Bonteheuwel has been a success. There were 44 killings in the first half of the year but there has been only one between June and mid-September; a hit on a gang leader. Police patrol in Manenberg and Bonteheuwel But a similar effort in Delft, a much bigger neighbourhood that lacks the strong community involvement that has taken place in Bonteheuwel, has had less impact, and there is little sign that the army deployment has improved the situation. By some measures, murders have increased. \u201cWe must not give up \u2026 I am optimistic,\u201d says Fritz. \u201cThe gangs \u2026 will always be there, but we can reduce their impact and power.\u201d One of the most notorious neighbourhoods is Manenberg, a crowded series of low-rise apartment blocks and battered two-room homes where a series of gangs \u2013 the Americans, Hard Livings, Fancy Boys, Dixie Boys and others \u2013 fight to control a lucrative trade in cannabis, crystal meth and sedatives. Officers from Cape Town\u2019s specialist anti-gang unit describe an anarchic free-for-all, with young criminals in their teens providing \u201ccannon fodder\u201d for wealthy criminals who live in big houses in sought-after suburbs well away from Manenberg\u2019s rubbish-strewn streets. Bonteheuwel in the Cape Flats \u201cThe gangs build support among local residents by providing protection, handouts sometimes and keeping order,\u201d says one officer. \u201cThat\u2019s a problem for us. Everyone should be equal before the law, whoever they are.\u201d Investigations into major gang leaders are often stymied by corruption and fear. Roegshanda Pascoe, an activist from Manenberg who witnessed a gang murder and agreed to testify against six men arrested for the killing, has faced attacks on her home and family. She has lived in a series of secret locations since the trial began, but has refused an official witness protection scheme that would have forced her to leave the region. \u201cI feel very hopeless,\u201d says Pascoe, 44. \u201cI will never be able to go home \u2026 But it\u2019s not just about people in Manenberg, or in Cape Town \u2026 it\u2019s about the whole nation.\u201d On the eastern fringe of the Flats, where the spectacular wineries and resorts that draw wealthy tourists from all over the world are clearly visible, is Mfuleni, an expanse of makeshift housing that is poor even by local standards. Ayanda Tunce: \u2018I am very worried about my kids and their future\u2019 Ayanda Tunce, known as 2SLY, grew up in Mfuleni. He spent 10 years as a gangster and five years in prison. Tunce, 34, once wanted to be a doctor. As a teenager he was running errands for gang leaders and got a criminal record. At 22, he robbed a local drug dealer of two handguns and set up his own gang, selling drugs and maiming rivals. Now a father of three, he lives in a two-room shack with no sanitation and says he has rejected crime. \u201cIt is worse today,\u201d he says. \u201cEvery weekend round here, we hear someone is dead, shot, raped, stabbed.

      "body": "<p>\u201cI\u2019m fascinated by it. It\u2019s history.\u201d Lenny Henry is explaining why he has decided to write an autobiography (<a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/who-am-i-again-9780571342594.html\" title=\"\">Who Am I, Again?</a>) about his childhood in Dudley and the beginning of his 45-year comedy career. For Henry, this isn\u2019t just a bit of navel-gazing and the odd anecdote featuring Chris Tarrant (although there is some of that). It is about bearing witness. \u201cI grew up in a period where, just down the road in Smethwick, a Tory politician got in with the slogan \u2018If you want a nigger for a neighbour vote Labour\u2019,\u201d he says, referring to Peter Griffiths\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/15/britains-most-racist-election-smethwick-50-years-on\" title=\"\">notorious 1964 election win for the Conservatives</a>. \u201cI\u2019m living just down the road from Wolverhampton, where the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/13/the-guardian-view-on-powells-rivers-of-blood-speech-handle-with-care\" title=\"\">Rivers of Blood speech</a> was made*. So I\u2019m in a place where there are toxic elements that you think would be an obstacle to my progress in life. But, actually, I think those things are part of what makes us stronger.\u201d</p> <p>Henry tells me this as we sit in the corner of a lounge bar that looks out over the old BBC Television Centre in west London. The place is decked out in mid-century modern decor, with plush stools and mood lighting. If we were meeting in the evening, you would expect him to order an old fashioned, but it is not even 10am and all he wants is a bit of toast. Henry \u2013 who is half incognito in a flat cap, glasses and a polka dot scarf \u2013 seems to be on first-name terms with all the staff and politely asks one of them to turn the muzak down a bit. This is very much his domain. \u201cAll that used to be offices,\u201d he says, gesturing toward a section of the building that has been turned into luxury flats. \u201cYou\u2019d go in there and get your ideas ripped apart.\u201d</p> <p>Now 61, Henry started his comedy career in 1975, and he has become arguably the UK\u2019s most recognisable comic. But there is a lot the British public don\u2019t know about Henry. In the book, the extent of the racist abuse he received as a young man, not to mention the physical violence at home, is revealed in painful detail. To write it, he looked back into his past, opened up a \u201cpandora\u2019s box\u201d of memories and then began, as he puts it, \u201cto vomit out the chapters\u201d.</p> <p>The book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/09/who-am-i-again-lenny-henry-review\" title=\"\">ranges from his infancy to until he was a few years into his nascent career</a>. It ends before his marriage to fellow comedian Dawn French in 1984; after 25 years together, they divorced in 2010. The pair have a daughter, Billie, who is in her late 20s. Henry is now in a relationship with the theatre producer and casting director Lisa Makin. When we meet, he has just landed from New York and needs to send her what he calls a \u201cyaaaaaay message\u201d to mark the occasion.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0cbd7bb313b393488dd8742675c760a02bd4c357\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0cbd7bb313b393488dd8742675c760a02bd4c357/569_0_2250_2251/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lenny Henry on New Faces in 1975\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The light entertainer: Lenny Henry on New Faces in 1975</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These days, Henry isn\u2019t considered a child star, but that is exactly what he was. Aged 16 when he made his TV debut, he arrived on our screens dressed in a wide-lapelled suit with an oversized bow tie and was introduced by Derek Hobson \u2013 the host of New Faces \u2013 as \u201ca Dudley lad\u201d. His impressions of Stevie Wonder, Muhammad Ali and Frank Spencer were good enough for him to win the talent competition and thrust him into the world of mid-70s light entertainment. Watching the footage now, it is striking how lanky and awkward and yet incredibly confident he was, suggesting years of practice, which in some ways was true.</p> <p>Throughout Who Am I, Again?, we see Henry using his comedy to ward off bellicose bullies or honing his short impressions sets in sometimes hostile working men\u2019s clubs. He turned the violence he received at the hands of his mother into a live performance that would eventually help him to buy her a home. But his honesty in revealing this in the autobiography caused friction. \u201cMy family were very sensitive about it,\u201d admits Henry, who had to work especially hard to convince his four older siblings (he is one of seven) of the merits of publishing a book about their difficult home life. \u201cThey all got their manuscripts and they were allowed to express what they felt about it and some of them were a bit weird about chatting about our business in public,\u201d he says. \u201cSome of them said: \u2018Go on, say it.\u2019 So I was encouraged by that.\u201d</p> <p>But despite the positive spin, there is a dark frankness to the book, not just when Henry recalls the racism he faced in his youth but, more so, when discussing his mother, Winifred. He puts the violent beatings she gave him down to her own upbringing. \u201cIt\u2019s an inherited violence,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd, you know, everybody hit their kids back then. Teachers backhanded you in the classroom in front of other kids. You got the stick, the cane, the slipper. Your mum beat you at home with a stick or a shoe. And if something happens enough, it becomes routine. I wasn\u2019t the only one.</p> <p>\u201cCharlie Chaplin used to say that comedy is tragedy plus time,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s true. Because when you\u2019re an eight-year-old kid and a grownup is beating you, all you\u2019re thinking is: \u2018When is this going to stop?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Yet Henry clearly revered his mother, who died in 1998. She came to Britain in the second wave of Caribbean immigration in 1957 and settled in the Midlands before having an affair, of which Henry was the result. When Henry was 10, his mother told him he had to go and do chores for his \u201cuncle\u201d Bertie in exchange for pocket money. He helped him every Friday for 18 months until he was told that Bertie was his real father, not Winston, the man he had grown up with. Henry says he was ashamed of the truth for years, but wants to \u201cown\u201d it now. \u201cMy story is an immigrant story,\u201d he says. \u201cMy story is of people moving from one country thousands of miles away to another and forming new links, new family and new relationships. And that\u2019s just what it is. It\u2019s not illicit, it\u2019s not salacious in any way. It\u2019s a life thing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2aab82b5d21ec66f27af05a72d45c04370f12aac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2aab82b5d21ec66f27af05a72d45c04370f12aac/0_300_4781_2869/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Henry, aged 16, with his mother\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Henry, aged 16, with his mother in January 1975, just after his TV debut.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Incredibly, Henry says it wasn\u2019t the revelation about his biological father or the beatings that caused him to feel anger toward his mother, but rather the moment when she started getting caught up in the circus that began to surround him as his career took off. \u201cI felt that she was buying into the showbiz story and she was changing,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy was she changing? This is the woman who, up to five minutes ago, would backhand me or beat me or whatever, and now she\u2019s calling me Lenny instead of Len.\u201d</p> <p>Some of this anger may stem from the situations that Henry was put in. He wasn\u2019t just on New Faces, <a href=\"https://televisionheaven.co.uk/reviews/tiswas\" title=\"\">Tiswas</a>, the Saturday-morning children\u2019s television programme, and <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073993/\" title=\"\">The Fosters</a>, the UK\u2019s first all-black sitcom; he was also on <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/historyofthebbc/100-voices/people-nation-empire/make-yourself-at-home/the-black-and-white-minstrel-show\" title=\"\">The Black and White Minstrel Show</a>, a decision that was taken by his family and management. Henry didn\u2019t perform in blackface, as some black comedians \u2013 such as Bert Williams in the early 1900s \u2013 had done, but he was on the same show as acts that would be repulsive to today\u2019s audiences. What does he think of the people who put him in that position? \u201cOf course I have an opinion,\u201d he says. \u201cI probably wouldn\u2019t share it with you. But I do know this: if it\u2019s me, and I\u2019m that person\u2019s parent or guardian, I\u2019m not going to let them be in a minstrel show.\u201d</p> <p>Henry describes Dudley in the 60s and 70s as a \u201csemi-racist\u201d environment, which seems generous considering the stories recorded in his book. What would be known now as \u201cmicro-aggressions\u201d were the best Henry could expect from some of his school friends, who were more likely to beat him up while calling him a \u201ccoon\u201d or a \u201cwog\u201d than to touch his hair without asking.

      "bodyText": "\u201cI\u2019m fascinated by it. It\u2019s history.\u201d Lenny Henry is explaining why he has decided to write an autobiography (Who Am I, Again?) about his childhood in Dudley and the beginning of his 45-year comedy career. For Henry, this isn\u2019t just a bit of navel-gazing and the odd anecdote featuring Chris Tarrant (although there is some of that). It is about bearing witness. \u201cI grew up in a period where, just down the road in Smethwick, a Tory politician got in with the slogan \u2018If you want a nigger for a neighbour vote Labour\u2019,\u201d he says, referring to Peter Griffiths\u2019 notorious 1964 election win for the Conservatives. \u201cI\u2019m living just down the road from Wolverhampton, where the Rivers of Blood speech was made*. So I\u2019m in a place where there are toxic elements that you think would be an obstacle to my progress in life. But, actually, I think those things are part of what makes us stronger.\u201d Henry tells me this as we sit in the corner of a lounge bar that looks out over the old BBC Television Centre in west London. The place is decked out in mid-century modern decor, with plush stools and mood lighting. If we were meeting in the evening, you would expect him to order an old fashioned, but it is not even 10am and all he wants is a bit of toast. Henry \u2013 who is half incognito in a flat cap, glasses and a polka dot scarf \u2013 seems to be on first-name terms with all the staff and politely asks one of them to turn the muzak down a bit. This is very much his domain. \u201cAll that used to be offices,\u201d he says, gesturing toward a section of the building that has been turned into luxury flats. \u201cYou\u2019d go in there and get your ideas ripped apart.\u201d Now 61, Henry started his comedy career in 1975, and he has become arguably the UK\u2019s most recognisable comic. But there is a lot the British public don\u2019t know about Henry. In the book, the extent of the racist abuse he received as a young man, not to mention the physical violence at home, is revealed in painful detail. To write it, he looked back into his past, opened up a \u201cpandora\u2019s box\u201d of memories and then began, as he puts it, \u201cto vomit out the chapters\u201d. The book ranges from his infancy to until he was a few years into his nascent career. It ends before his marriage to fellow comedian Dawn French in 1984; after 25 years together, they divorced in 2010. The pair have a daughter, Billie, who is in her late 20s. Henry is now in a relationship with the theatre producer and casting director Lisa Makin. When we meet, he has just landed from New York and needs to send her what he calls a \u201cyaaaaaay message\u201d to mark the occasion. These days, Henry isn\u2019t considered a child star, but that is exactly what he was. Aged 16 when he made his TV debut, he arrived on our screens dressed in a wide-lapelled suit with an oversized bow tie and was introduced by Derek Hobson \u2013 the host of New Faces \u2013 as \u201ca Dudley lad\u201d. His impressions of Stevie Wonder, Muhammad Ali and Frank Spencer were good enough for him to win the talent competition and thrust him into the world of mid-70s light entertainment. Watching the footage now, it is striking how lanky and awkward and yet incredibly confident he was, suggesting years of practice, which in some ways was true. Throughout Who Am I, Again?, we see Henry using his comedy to ward off bellicose bullies or honing his short impressions sets in sometimes hostile working men\u2019s clubs. He turned the violence he received at the hands of his mother into a live performance that would eventually help him to buy her a home. But his honesty in revealing this in the autobiography caused friction. \u201cMy family were very sensitive about it,\u201d admits Henry, who had to work especially hard to convince his four older siblings (he is one of seven) of the merits of publishing a book about their difficult home life. \u201cThey all got their manuscripts and they were allowed to express what they felt about it and some of them were a bit weird about chatting about our business in public,\u201d he says. \u201cSome of them said: \u2018Go on, say it.\u2019 So I was encouraged by that.\u201d But despite the positive spin, there is a dark frankness to the book, not just when Henry recalls the racism he faced in his youth but, more so, when discussing his mother, Winifred. He puts the violent beatings she gave him down to her own upbringing. \u201cIt\u2019s an inherited violence,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd, you know, everybody hit their kids back then. Teachers backhanded you in the classroom in front of other kids. You got the stick, the cane, the slipper. Your mum beat you at home with a stick or a shoe. And if something happens enough, it becomes routine. I wasn\u2019t the only one. \u201cCharlie Chaplin used to say that comedy is tragedy plus time,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s true. Because when you\u2019re an eight-year-old kid and a grownup is beating you, all you\u2019re thinking is: \u2018When is this going to stop?\u2019\u201d Yet Henry clearly revered his mother, who died in 1998. She came to Britain in the second wave of Caribbean immigration in 1957 and settled in the Midlands before having an affair, of which Henry was the result. When Henry was 10, his mother told him he had to go and do chores for his \u201cuncle\u201d Bertie in exchange for pocket money. He helped him every Friday for 18 months until he was told that Bertie was his real father, not Winston, the man he had grown up with. Henry says he was ashamed of the truth for years, but wants to \u201cown\u201d it now. \u201cMy story is an immigrant story,\u201d he says. \u201cMy story is of people moving from one country thousands of miles away to another and forming new links, new family and new relationships. And that\u2019s just what it is. It\u2019s not illicit, it\u2019s not salacious in any way. It\u2019s a life thing.\u201d Incredibly, Henry says it wasn\u2019t the revelation about his biological father or the beatings that caused him to feel anger toward his mother, but rather the moment when she started getting caught up in the circus that began to surround him as his career took off. \u201cI felt that she was buying into the showbiz story and she was changing,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy was she changing? This is the woman who, up to five minutes ago, would backhand me or beat me or whatever, and now she\u2019s calling me Lenny instead of Len.\u201d Some of this anger may stem from the situations that Henry was put in. He wasn\u2019t just on New Faces, Tiswas, the Saturday-morning children\u2019s television programme, and The Fosters, the UK\u2019s first all-black sitcom; he was also on The Black and White Minstrel Show, a decision that was taken by his family and management. Henry didn\u2019t perform in blackface, as some black comedians \u2013 such as Bert Williams in the early 1900s \u2013 had done, but he was on the same show as acts that would be repulsive to today\u2019s audiences. What does he think of the people who put him in that position? \u201cOf course I have an opinion,\u201d he says. \u201cI probably wouldn\u2019t share it with you. But I do know this: if it\u2019s me, and I\u2019m that person\u2019s parent or guardian, I\u2019m not going to let them be in a minstrel show.\u201d Henry describes Dudley in the 60s and 70s as a \u201csemi-racist\u201d environment, which seems generous considering the stories recorded in his book. What would be known now as \u201cmicro-aggressions\u201d were the best Henry could expect from some of his school friends, who were more likely to beat him up while calling him a \u201ccoon\u201d or a \u201cwog\u201d than to touch his hair without asking. Looking back, Henry wishes that he had been more like the Jamaican boys who met racist epithets and violence with fists and bricks of their own. \u201cI wish my dad or somebody had taught me how to fight and defend myself,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause you\u2019re very vulnerable if you can\u2019t stick up for yourself. I wish I\u2019d fought back and I think that\u2019s now where all the activism comes from. It\u2019s this thing of speaking your mind and not being scared \u2013 and we need to be, because we\u2019re all being embarrassed by a 16-year-old girl from Sweden at the moment.\u201d But being brave and speaking out wasn\u2019t simple in 1975 for a teenage black British comic. Henry was told by managers and peers that the place for \u201cpolitics is in your private life \u2013 you don\u2019t do politics on stage\u201d. It was advice he heeded until he began to call for the entertainment industry to address the systemic racism that he had seen throughout his career. In 2008, Henry made a hard-hitting speech to the Royal Television Society, slamming broadcasters for not doing more to encourage ethnic diversity. In an interview with the Guardian shortly afterwards, he said: \u201cI do not think the media is racist. I do think that, as an industry, we are stuck in terms of providing a support system for black, Asian and ethnic minorities who don\u2019t have a natural way into the industry. It\u2019s bullshit, it needs to change.\u201d It didn\u2019t. So, in 2014, he was louder still, calling out the industry\u2019s terrible record on diversity in a Bafta lecture. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t just hitting the glass ceiling: they are standing on a glass precipice,\u201d he said. Recently, Henry was one of the prominent Britons of colour who wrote to the BBC to complain about the treatment of Naga Munchetty. The corporation had disciplined her, but not her co-host, Dan Walker, after a discussion about Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cgo home\u201d comments aimed at black and Muslim US senators.

And I thought: \u2018Oh, OK, things are changing.\u2019 That never happened again. That was an anomaly. I never met a makeup artist of colour for the next 35 years.\u201d Henry is doing his bit to offset some of that imbalance with a new series for Gold \u2013 Lenny Henry\u2019s Race Through Comedy \u2013 in which he tells the mostly forgotten story of black British comedians such as Charlie Williams, the Doncaster standup and former professional footballer he used to impersonate. He has also been an outspoken critic of the government\u2019s treatment of the Windrush generation, and earlier this year starred in and executive produced Soon Gone, a BBC drama that was, in part, inspired by the scandal, of which he \u201cfelt the sting of injustice\u201d. One place that Henry has been able to make a significant impact is with Comic Relief, the charity he co-founded with Richard Curtis in 1985 in response to famine in Ethiopia. Last year, Comic Relief had its effectiveness called into question.

Simpson can\u2019t escape them at home either. He lives in a huge duplex \u2013 complete with its own olive grove \u2013 at the top of nearby <a href=\"https://www.simpsonhaugh.com/projects/beetham-hilton-tower\">Beetham Tower</a>. Completed in 2006, Beetham is itself 47 storeys tall, making it, until last year, the city\u2019s tallest structure. \u201cLooking out at night,\u201d he says, \u201call I see is red aircraft warning lights.\u201d </p> <p>It sounds like an irritant, but for Simpson this red panorama symbolises the realisation of his quest to make Manchester a mecca for high-rise, city-centre living. \u201cManchester\u2019s city core had about 400 people living in it when the IRA bomb went off in 1996,\u201d he says. \u201cNow it\u2019s got about 35,000. I\u2019d like it to have 200,000, because the one thing the city needs is people. That drives everything else.\u201d</p> <p>Simpson says the centre \u201cused to be a ghetto for people who couldn\u2019t get out\u201d, but now it\u2019s a desirable place \u2013 and it needs the swanky flats to match. \u201cPart of the problem,\u201d he adds, \u201cis that there aren\u2019t enough expensive homes in the city.\u201d<br><br>Simpson believes this influx of luxury flats should be welcomed, because it means that those who would otherwise be driving in from the affluent commuter suburbs \u2013 Altrincham, Wilmslow, Didsbury \u2013 will now be able to live in the centre. The absence of affordable housing, he argues, is a consequence of financial viability. \u201cIt\u2019s really difficult to build a tall building cost-effectively. None of these developers really make super profits in Manchester. It\u2019s not at all like London.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"31e4af156cc22ca16fe8bd501d59de4da2dba9af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31e4af156cc22ca16fe8bd501d59de4da2dba9af/152_200_964_579/500.jpg\" alt=\"Trinity Islands.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trinity Islands, acquired by Renaker, which has permission to build the tallest residential tower in western Europe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allied London</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Renaker, the developer-builder behind Deansgate Square and a large number of towers nearby, seems to be doing quite well out of it. In its most recent financial results, the firm reported a turnover of \u00a3132.8m, up 37% on the previous year, with pre-tax profits of \u00a34.6m. Last year, it acquired <a href=\"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/business/business-news/allied-london-sells-trinity-islands-15261053\">the prominent Trinity Islands</a><a href=\"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/business/business-news/allied-london-sells-trinity-islands-15261053\"> site</a>, which has permission to build the tallest residential tower in western Europe. Global real estate group CBRE puts the average residential yield in Manchester at 5.8%, compared with 3% in London. As one industry source puts it: \u201cThe returns are higher in Manchester \u2013 that\u2019s why all the money moved here.\u201d<br><br>Dr Jonathan Silver, an urban academic, began investigating <a href=\"http://www.gmhousingaction.com/report_launched_on_housing_finance_gm/\">the building boom</a> when he returned to Manchester after a few years away \u2013 and found a homeless camp on Oxford Road, near where the first towers were sprouting.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a very powerful juxtaposition that reminded me of cities I\u2019d been researching in Africa,\u201d he says. \u201cEverything had changed. Until 2013, Manchester\u2019s development model was quite provincial: local developers using national banks, building the schemes and selling them to individual buyers. Now it\u2019s a tool the city is using to reinsert itself into the world economy, courting investment from China to Abu Dhabi.\u201d He says that, since the 90s, Manchester\u2019s mantra has been: \u201cAny investment is good investment.\u201d But times have changed, he warns, and the council needs to wake up.<br><br>Sam Wheeler agrees. \u201cThere was this desperation to reverse the post-industrial decline and transform the city centre at any cost. And they did it. People have come. It\u2019s worked. But we\u2019re in a different situation now. The population isn\u2019t declining and developers aren\u2019t going to run a mile if we insist they contribute to some social housing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d2eb8920dfba93d0cc0012a7436f4ea23e9a62e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2eb8920dfba93d0cc0012a7436f4ea23e9a62e1/0_0_973_661/500.jpg\" alt=\"Controversial \u2026 CGI showing St Michael\u2019s tower, fronted by Gary Neville and Ryan Giggs, and the historic monuments it will loom over.\" width=\"500\" height=\"340\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Controversial \u2026 CGI showing St Michael\u2019s tower, fronted by Gary Neville and Ryan Giggs, and the historic monuments it will loom over.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Hodder</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Richard Leese, leader of Manchester city council since 1996 and much credited with turning the city around, insists the council is tough on developers. \u201cI\u2019m confident we\u2019ve been getting the best deal we could for a long time,\u201d he says. \u201cOur planning officers have access to robust assessment methods, but it\u2019s still hard to make these schemes stack up financially.\u201d He says it comes down to a choice: \u201cWe either swallow green belt, or we build densely on brownfield sites. I don\u2019t think the towers are too tall. In 20 years, people will be saying, \u2018Why did you build them so small?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/feb/23/wanton-vandalism-neville-giggs-manchester-towers-st-michaels-council\">St Michael\u2019s tower</a> \u2013 the controversial project fronted by the former footballers Gary Neville and Ryan Giggs for tycoon Peter Lim who made his fortune in palm oil \u2013 is finally looming over the Grade I-listed town hall, it\u2019s hard to imagine many will wish the 40-storey skyscraper had been even bigger. Leese\u2019s argument seems disingenuous: saying no to these silos does not mean tearing up green fields around the city instead. It is perfectly possible to build mixed-tenure communities at high density on brownfield sites in a manner that fits the rest of the city. It just requires a little more effort and a decent plan \u2013 not the current approach of filling each site to its limits and pushing for the maximum height until it hits the airport flight path.</p> <p>\u201cThe situation is truly shameful,\u201d says Dr Margaret Collier of the Manchester Civic Society, which crowdfunded a campaign to challenge St Michael\u2019s tower decision. \u201cThe planning system is not fit for purpose, and authorities aren\u2019t looking with sufficient scrutiny at what\u2019s in front of them. We\u2019ve got a wonderful historic core in Manchester. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right that it has turned out to be impossible to protect it.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If the barman, cleaner or nurse can\u2019t get a home, it\u2019s not their city</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It seems no corner of the city is safe. In the bohemian <a href=\"https://northernquartermanchester.com/\">Northern Quarter</a>, a proposal for an angular glass stump \u2013 which was rejected three times by councillors for being too tall \u2013 was recently approved, despite the latest vision being the biggest yet. Dubbed the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/northern-quarter-glass-shard-development-16499106\">Shudehill Shard</a>\u201d and backed by Betfred billionaire Fred Done, the project will see a 17-storey glass wedge arrive in the colourful low-rise district, once again providing no affordable housing, despite being on a council-owned site.</p> <p>As Wheeler asked at the time: \u201cDoes [the council] flog off some of the last, democratically controlled land in the city centre for a billionaire\u2019s vanity project, or does it listen to local people and their representatives, and use its power to make developers act with some responsibility?\u201d It chose the former.</p> <p>There are signs, however, that Mancunians\u2019 vocal criticisms are beginning to have an impact. The first tower to include on-site affordable housing was secured earlier this year, <a href=\"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/new-manchester-city-centre-skyscraper-15761672\">in the form of the 30-storey Swan House</a>, although it will still be only 5% of the total number of flats. Meanwhile, the council has started to make viability assessments public, and has introduced a \u201cclawback mechanism\u201d, for when developments turn out to be more profitable than expected. The council must have the confidence to insist on truly inclusive developments, with a higher calibre of design that respects the city\u2019s fabric, otherwise the lifeblood of Manchester, the fuel in the powerhouse\u2019s engine, will drain away.<br><br>\u201cIf the barman, cleaner or nurse can\u2019t get a home,\u201d says Wheeler, \u201cit\u2019s not their city. The people who make the city function need to be able to live here. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a particularly radical thing to ask.\u201d<br><br>\u2022 Oliver Wainwright will debate these issues at <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/4x4-manchester-sin-city-tickets-69730577033\">Sin City?

That drives everything else.\u201d Simpson says the centre \u201cused to be a ghetto for people who couldn\u2019t get out\u201d, but now it\u2019s a desirable place \u2013 and it needs the swanky flats to match. \u201cPart of the problem,\u201d he adds, \u201cis that there aren\u2019t enough expensive homes in the city.\u201d Simpson believes this influx of luxury flats should be welcomed, because it means that those who would otherwise be driving in from the affluent commuter suburbs \u2013 Altrincham, Wilmslow, Didsbury \u2013 will now be able to live in the centre. The absence of affordable housing, he argues, is a consequence of financial viability. \u201cIt\u2019s really difficult to build a tall building cost-effectively. None of these developers really make super profits in Manchester. It\u2019s not at all like London.\u201d Renaker, the developer-builder behind Deansgate Square and a large number of towers nearby, seems to be doing quite well out of it. In its most recent financial results, the firm reported a turnover of \u00a3132.8m, up 37% on the previous year, with pre-tax profits of \u00a34.6m. Last year, it acquired the prominent Trinity Islands site, which has permission to build the tallest residential tower in western Europe. Global real estate group CBRE puts the average residential yield in Manchester at 5.8%, compared with 3% in London. As one industry source puts it: \u201cThe returns are higher in Manchester \u2013 that\u2019s why all the money moved here.\u201d Dr Jonathan Silver, an urban academic, began investigating the building boom when he returned to Manchester after a few years away \u2013 and found a homeless camp on Oxford Road, near where the first towers were sprouting. \u201cIt was a very powerful juxtaposition that reminded me of cities I\u2019d been researching in Africa,\u201d he says. \u201cEverything had changed. Until 2013, Manchester\u2019s development model was quite provincial: local developers using national banks, building the schemes and selling them to individual buyers. Now it\u2019s a tool the city is using to reinsert itself into the world economy, courting investment from China to Abu Dhabi.\u201d He says that, since the 90s, Manchester\u2019s mantra has been: \u201cAny investment is good investment.\u201d But times have changed, he warns, and the council needs to wake up. Sam Wheeler agrees. \u201cThere was this desperation to reverse the post-industrial decline and transform the city centre at any cost. And they did it. People have come. It\u2019s worked. But we\u2019re in a different situation now. The population isn\u2019t declining and developers aren\u2019t going to run a mile if we insist they contribute to some social housing.\u201d Richard Leese, leader of Manchester city council since 1996 and much credited with turning the city around, insists the council is tough on developers. \u201cI\u2019m confident we\u2019ve been getting the best deal we could for a long time,\u201d he says. \u201cOur planning officers have access to robust assessment methods, but it\u2019s still hard to make these schemes stack up financially.\u201d He says it comes down to a choice: \u201cWe either swallow green belt, or we build densely on brownfield sites. I don\u2019t think the towers are too tall. In 20 years, people will be saying, \u2018Why did you build them so small?\u2019\u201d When St Michael\u2019s tower \u2013 the controversial project fronted by the former footballers Gary Neville and Ryan Giggs for tycoon Peter Lim who made his fortune in palm oil \u2013 is finally looming over the Grade I-listed town hall, it\u2019s hard to imagine many will wish the 40-storey skyscraper had been even bigger. Leese\u2019s argument seems disingenuous: saying no to these silos does not mean tearing up green fields around the city instead. It is perfectly possible to build mixed-tenure communities at high density on brownfield sites in a manner that fits the rest of the city. It just requires a little more effort and a decent plan \u2013 not the current approach of filling each site to its limits and pushing for the maximum height until it hits the airport flight path. \u201cThe situation is truly shameful,\u201d says Dr Margaret Collier of the Manchester Civic Society, which crowdfunded a campaign to challenge St Michael\u2019s tower decision. \u201cThe planning system is not fit for purpose, and authorities aren\u2019t looking with sufficient scrutiny at what\u2019s in front of them. We\u2019ve got a wonderful historic core in Manchester. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right that it has turned out to be impossible to protect it.\u201d It seems no corner of the city is safe. In the bohemian Northern Quarter, a proposal for an angular glass stump \u2013 which was rejected three times by councillors for being too tall \u2013 was recently approved, despite the latest vision being the biggest yet. Dubbed the \u201cShudehill Shard\u201d and backed by Betfred billionaire Fred Done, the project will see a 17-storey glass wedge arrive in the colourful low-rise district, once again providing no affordable housing, despite being on a council-owned site. As Wheeler asked at the time: \u201cDoes [the council] flog off some of the last, democratically controlled land in the city centre for a billionaire\u2019s vanity project, or does it listen to local people and their representatives, and use its power to make developers act with some responsibility?\u201d It chose the former. There are signs, however, that Mancunians\u2019 vocal criticisms are beginning to have an impact. The first tower to include on-site affordable housing was secured earlier this year, in the form of the 30-storey Swan House, although it will still be only 5% of the total number of flats. Meanwhile, the council has started to make viability assessments public, and has introduced a \u201cclawback mechanism\u201d, for when developments turn out to be more profitable than expected. The council must have the confidence to insist on truly inclusive developments, with a higher calibre of design that respects the city\u2019s fabric, otherwise the lifeblood of Manchester, the fuel in the powerhouse\u2019s engine, will drain away. \u201cIf the barman, cleaner or nurse can\u2019t get a home,\u201d says Wheeler, \u201cit\u2019s not their city. The people who make the city function need to be able to live here. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a particularly radical thing to ask.\u201d \u2022 Oliver Wainwright will debate these issues at Sin City? The Morality of Urban Growth, at the Fairfield Social Club, Manchester, on 22 October.",

She makes this abundantly clear in a post directed at Grace Spelman, formerly a content producer at BuzzFeed, during one of Calloway\u2019s many forgettable spats with media workers whose criticisms she has found chafing.</p> <p>\u201cFYI I prefer \u2018writer\u2019, like you, Grace,\u201d Calloway noted in a parenthetical within a wall of text (Spelman had called her an \u201cInstagram blogger\u201d, which, for my money, is pretty apt).</p> <p>Elsewhere on her Instagram, Calloway <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B1SnimqBQJe/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\">posts a picture of Trick Mirror</a>, the lauded debut essay collection from the New Yorker writer Jia Tolentino. The book makes her \u201cinsecure\u201d, she writes, because she can\u2019t seem to measure up to Tolentino\u2019s pristine search results. \u201cWhen you type Jia Tolentino into Google you get: Great writer! Benefit of the doubt! Kind assumptions! Media EGOT!\u201d She contrasts this apparent luck with her own results, which yield unsparing (and, frankly, excessive) coverage of some poorly planned \u201ccreativity workshops\u201d consisting of flower crowns, salads, and organized vulnerability.</p> <p>Calloway\u2019s writerly ambition had been to <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2019/09/the-story-of-caroline-calloway-and-her-ghostwriter-natalie.html\">document her life</a> in real time on a platform best known for sharing selfies, to pioneer a new genre of memoir while cultivating a loyal social media following. She had secured a book deal at one point but wasn\u2019t able to deliver due to a worsening addiction to Adderall, so Instagram remained her literary venue of choice. And why not? Many writers \u2013 good writers \u2013 self-publish via newsletters or blogging platforms; the choice of the photo-centric Instagram merely makes the writer\u2019s intentions of self-commodification more straightforward. There could not be any confusion about what was being sold: not just prose, but the person herself.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"372396a29d5c3be51ab2f25d89792b5662548298\"> <img src=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2019/10/17/final_update.gif\" alt=\"Writer instagram illustration\" width=\"700\" height=\"467\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>But to describe Calloway as a writer first and foremost would be extraordinarily generous. Her frenzied, disjointed dispatches beneath photos of her art-cluttered West Village studio floor are, in and of themselves, often myopic and uninteresting. It is the media-fueled mythos around her \u2013 the disintegrated book deal, the \u201cscam\u201d workshops, the sensational and damning the Cut essay from her former best friend and collaborator Natalie Beach \u2013 that have earned my attention and emotional investment. To my shame, I read every word Calloway writes.</p> <p>But perhaps Calloway could be forgiven for conflating the work of writing with the work of marketing oneself as a writer. After all, to be a writer today <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lrsphm/status/1174061578502705152?s=20\">is to make yourself a product for public consumption</a> on the internet, to project an appealing image that contextualizes the actual writing. The women \u2013 and they are mostly women \u2013 who are most heralded in the media industry today are extremely online, starring in photoshoots and documenting their skincare routines and eating habits as much as discussing their process.</p> <p>The influencer is insecure about not being the writer. But over this past summer of viral internet-fueled grifts and an equally intense barrage of high-profile book launches and interview tours, it struck me that there is functionally little difference between a lauded writer with a recognizable avatar and a prominent social-media influencer. The only difference is in the way each metabolizes the experience of influence.</p> <h2><strong>Self-</strong><strong>conscious </strong><strong>authenticity</strong></h2> <p>The most famous writers have always been public figures with their own media-fueled mythos, of course. We have the glamorous mystique of Joan Didion, whose <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/09/the-elitist-allure-of-joan-didion/399320/\">aspirational \u201ccool\u201d</a> has made her a persistent object of reverence for white women with literary ambitions; the wild lore of Hunter S Thompson with his drugs and guns, the cigarette holder and aviators instantly recognizable even to those who haven\u2019t read him; and the literary \u201c<a href=\"https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/a27434009/bennington-college-oral-history-bret-easton-ellis/\">Brat Pack</a>\u201d of Bret Easton Ellis, Jay McInerney, and company, who were themselves objects of fascination as extensions of their depressive, decadent, druggy fiction. Benjamin Moser\u2019s new authorized biography of Susan Sontag painstakingly attempts to reconcile the writer\u2019s contradictory private self with her glamorous persona as a public intellectual. The book\u2019s many reviews grapple with the <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/09/23/susan-sontag-and-the-unholy-practice-of-biography\">unreliability</a> of biographical interpretation and the <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/10/misunderstanding-susan-sontag/596653/\">insertions</a> of the biographer\u2019s own biases and blindspots.</p> <p>But the image management that once seemed incidental, or at least parallel, to the literary profession seems now one of its most necessary, integral functions. In the age of Twitter and Instagram, an online presence, which is necessarily public and necessarily consumable, seems all but mandatory for a writer who reaches (or hopes to reach) a certain level of renown, especially for anyone dealing in personal essays or cultural criticism. In the way that the influencer uses her image to sell her swag, the writer leverages her life to sell her work, to editors and audiences.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/12/who-is-caroline-calloway-and-why-cant-the-internet-stop-talking-about-her\">Who is Caroline Calloway, and why can't the internet stop talking about her?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Naomi Fry, known for her sharp dissections of celebrity, social media, and meme culture at <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/naomi-fry\">the New Yorker</a>, is perhaps equally known for her own social media presence as a funny, astute documentarian of her <a href=\"https://twitter.com/frynaomifry/status/1180172520303075330?s=20\">personal life</a>, though always within the context of her job at a prestige publication and with more than a whiff of irony. If celebrities who play well on social media do so by being funny and relatable but more glamorous than you, writers who play well on those same platforms do so by being funny and relatable but smarter and more successful than you.</p> <p>Last year, Fry gave an interview to <a href=\"https://www.thecaret.co/interviews/naomi-fry-new-yorker\">the Caret</a>, a tech publication that interviews \u201cinnovators and visionaries shaping the digital landscape\u201d, in which she took stock of her modest internet fame and connection to influencer culture. \u201cWhen it comes to so-called \u2018personal brand building\u2019, even when you don\u2019t think you\u2019re doing it, you\u2019re still kind of doing it,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I\u2019m not going to pretend it\u2019s something I\u2019m not totally aware of, as anyone on social media is. But I think it\u2019s true that I have no interest in presenting my life in a way that\u2019s idealized.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, who in the irony-soaked world of New York media does? For all our talk of Instagram as a vehicle for curating an idealized self, we know grainy displays of self-awareness are the real ticket \u2013 filterless, sparse bathroom mirror selfies are infinitely cooler than the obviously posed and airbrushed. They denote a certain status, in fact, that comes with being in on the collective joke, with understanding the illusory nature of the medium and making use of it in a wry punchline at your own expense. You don\u2019t have to look talented or elegant online \u2013 as long as you are, or could be.</p> <p>If you aren\u2019t already (internet-)famous, the lack of idealization, or the appearance thereof, could hurt you in the eyes of your peers or bosses. This is not a concern for the writer-influencer. On social media they joke about not writing, about their elaborate procrastination techniques, about getting high, about angsting to their therapists who don\u2019t understand the internet. Like descendants of Carrie Bradshaw in her apartment with its designer shoe-filled oven, they are performatively, romantically messy.</p> <p>I couldn\u2019t help but wonder: if this self-consciously unadorned authenticity \u2013 the thing supposedly separating writers from the polished Instagram influencers they critique \u2013 yields status, followers, and an aspirational yearning in their fans, what\u2019s the difference?</p> <h2><strong>Intention to influence</strong></h2> <p>As digital journalism has converged with influencer culture, a whole genre of coverage has sprung up to account for it, including breathless book-launch coverage around star authors that feels more like celebrity voyeurism. We want to know what and how writers eat, which skincare products they smear on their faces, and what they\u2019re reading when they\u2019re not writing. And so we have the debut writer\u2019s holy trinity of New York Magazine\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.grubstreet.com/tags/the-grub-street-diet/\">Grub Street Diet</a>, Into the Gloss\u2019s <a href=\"https://intothegloss.com/categories/the-top-shelf/\">Top Shelf</a>, and the New York Times\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/column/by-the-book\">By the Book</a>. Jia Tolentino checked all of these boxes throughout her very visible book publicity tour over the summer \u2013 a relentless whirlwind of glowing press \u2013 and made self-deprecating <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jiatolentino/status/1160225276917428224?s=20\">jokes</a> about saturating our newsfeeds (which felt very much in keeping with her public image we had come to know through these dispatches).</p> <p>I asked Tolentino in an email about this exposure, about the cultivation of a public persona online, and the degree to which she goes about doing so consciously. She responded that she had been thinking about the question a lot lately, as she\u2019d been \u201cstrapped to the soul-crushing (if also very fortunate) machine of book promotion\u201d. She is distressed by the imperative to commodify herself to sell her work, but it is something she recognizes as inescapable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1a69f726a9bc7b1a1d46c6e034b916d3f1fd9053\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a69f726a9bc7b1a1d46c6e034b916d3f1fd9053/0_0_1080_1487/726.jpg\" alt=\"Writer instagram illustration\" width=\"726\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>\u201cA good amount of my book is about how capitalism, the internet, the monetized self are all destructive to our functioning as real humans; yet, the better I express those ideas, the better I become a marketable object myself,\u201d Tolentino explained. \u201cI\u2019ve spent a lot of time, while promoting Trick Mirror, wondering if the work that brings me the most meaning in life (writing) will always necessarily bring me deeper into the clutches of the things that I hate (capitalism, and a way of being in which external incentives seem more important than internal ones).\u201d</p> <p>She tries to navigate her life online \u201cunconsciously, instinctively\u201d, and without losing sight of the fact that her real life is more important than what she projects to an audience. \u201cOne of the worst things that the internet does is make us value representations of a thing over the actual thing itself, and I think I just try to stay tight to that understanding \u2013 that my actual self and life are a lot more important to me than the online representation of such, that my work is more important to me than any public idea of that work.\u201d</p> <p>Tavi Gevinson, the polymathic founder of <a href=\"https://www.rookiemag.com/\">Rookie</a>, grapples with this duality between the work and the worker\u2019s persona in a New York Magazine <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2019/09/who-would-tavi-gevinson-be-without-instagram.html#_ga=2.87718943.685553109.1570633032-2111855782.1512585466\">cover story</a> on how Instagram fame shaped her sense of self and her career alike. \u201cI think I am a writer and an actor and an artist,\u201d she writes. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t believed the purity of my own intentions ever since I became my own salesperson, too.\u201d The more she focuses on her own work, embracing the archetype of the writer rather than the influencer, the farther away she stays from Instagram, delegating updates to an assistant.</p> <p>But when it comes to the commodification of the self, the work and the public idea of the work are often conflated, just as the internet flattens everything else. It\u2019s harder to separate the art from the artist, or the artist\u2019s skincare. Maybe that is the natural endpoint of the influencer\u2019s internet. Caroline Calloway\u2019s great project is, ultimately, making her inner life into what she calls \u201c<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B2-sQpeBbWG/\">digital art</a>\u201d, her life and its representation one glorious entangled mess. She has pursued the solidification of a public idea first and foremost; the body of work she has amassed in her posts project the persona she has made for herself. She knows she is a salesperson \u2013 both of <a href=\"https://www.elle.com/culture/art-design/a29339843/caroline-calloway-matisse-dreamer-bbs-art/\">Matisse knockoffs</a> and of her actual self \u2013 and not only bluntly admits it but confidently conflates it with her creativity.</p> <p>The self-disclosure required of an influencer whose brand is vulnerability, already unsettlingly close to the work-mandated social-media shilling required of most writers, can become almost indistinguishable from the work of an essayist who deals in the personal. In this way, the influencer could simply be a digital update of the confessional writer.</p> <p>Shannon Keating at BuzzFeed recently wrote an <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/shannonkeating/personal-writing-social-media-influencers-caroline-calloway\">essay</a> exploring how the Calloway phenomenon has prompted her to re-examine her choice to write first-person essays. She draws a line, <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/study-hall-9-16-30009636\">as I also did</a>, from the dusk of the \u201cfirst-person industrial complex\u201d to the dawn of the influencer, what she considers to be an \u201ceven more complicated and ethically murky digital economy of self-exposure and service content\u201d, spawned by a desperation for a clearly defined sense of identity. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for answers,\u201d writes Keating. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for relatable (or even better, aspirational) role models who are willing to open their lives up to us for inspection, and social media has spawned an endless supply of them.\u201d (It\u2019s an arc that can be traced back to Emily Gould in the early days of Gawker, who documented her experience in a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/25/magazine/25internet-t.html\">2008 New York Times Magazine essay</a>.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c275ede9dca6e54350239811aa2761c93e1c4023\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c275ede9dca6e54350239811aa2761c93e1c4023/0_218_6537_3922/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jia Tolentino.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jia Tolentino.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elena Mudd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The root of all this angst: Keating had recently written a viral essay for BuzzFeed about falling in love on a lesbian cruise, and the effects of that virality had rendered her a de facto influencer, which troubled her. Had she, through the act of writing, made her personal life into a public commodity? \u201cThe last thing I wanted was to turn Lynette and me into some sort of lesbian influencer couple, selling us as a desirable product \u2026 I\u2019d much rather people check up on me to read my latest article, not to learn whether or not I\u2019m still with my girlfriend,\u201d she writes. \u201cBut as someone who mines her own life for content \u2013 who always has and probably always will \u2013 I know that\u2019s a ridiculous thing to wish for.\u201d</p> <p>Calloway, for her part, does not seem conflicted about her self-exposure in the slightest; nor, really, does the journalist Lauren Duca, whose aggressive personal branding has propelled her to the level of living meme. Duca got famous for a Teen Vogue piece that, for better or worse, reintroduced the term \u201cgaslighting\u201d into our political and personal nomenclature, but equally for calling Tucker Carlson a \u201csexist pig\u201d as her mic was cut. Then she sold T-shirts emblazoned with a catchphrase borrowed from Carlson\u2019s sexist rant.</p> <p>Still, she insists her public presence isn\u2019t self-aggrandizing. She is furious at any comparisons between herself and Calloway, claiming they overshadow her <a href=\"https://twitter.com/laurenduca/status/1177971522448871424?s=20\">\u201cserious and important work\u201d</a>. But that work, at least after the initial Teen Vogue salvos and TV appearances, has undoubtedly been overshadowed by her own labor of peddling a persona. Like Calloway, Duca has drawn hundreds of thousands of followers not just through a body of writing but through the projection of a lifestyle that appears compelling in a not particularly radical or innovative way.</p> <p>Highly paid talks, university teaching gigs, big book deals, and sassy clapback-style tweets is a pretty uncontroversial vision of success as a journalist that many of us would like to copy, whatever we think of Duca herself. But all of this external posturing has overshadowed any actual reportage: at some point, the \u201cwork\u201d becomes the continued maintenance of the image.</p> <h2><strong>The anxiety of influencing</strong></h2> <p>To truly contend with a term I suppose we should define it. A social media influencer, according to the <a href=\"https://digitalmarketinginstitute.com/en-us/blog/9-of-the-biggest-social-media-influencers-on-instagram\">Digital Marketing Institute</a>, is simply \u201ca user who has established credibility in a specific industry, has access to a huge audience and can persuade others to act based on their recommendations\u201d. This is a broad definition that could encompass everyone from Chrissy Teigen (a celebrity who effectively markets her relatability) to Shaun King (another <a href=\"https://medium.com/@shewritestolive/the-shaun-king-were-not-talking-about-84c46ab40079\">alleged grifter</a>).</p> <p>When encountering the influencer, we must therefore determine how their credibility was established, in which specific industry, and to what end they deploy their powers of persuasion. The answers to those questions determine whether we view a person online as worthy of our reverence or our scorn. We can accept Jia Tolentino\u2019s skincare tips because we know the work at the core of this brand is as solid as it gets, whereas Caroline Calloway becomes a punchline, because even the content that did exist was a ghostwritten illusion.</p> <p>The problem comes down to the way we view work, and what we view as \u201cwork\u201d in the first place. There is a perception that to simply exist in public space, to influence by living, is not work at all. These influencers who produce photos of themselves, who turn their wider lives into content rather than confining themselves to a byline, are thus dismissed as vapid and shallow, sources of pleasure and no more. The writer, by contrast, is viewed primarily as a purveyor of intellect and meritorious beauty. The writer gives us art, gives us insight and rigor, contextualizes the phenomena that confound us. Their labor is seen as more valid.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7258647b0d65fc7f2c5571edf3a716cf0e4b7b8c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7258647b0d65fc7f2c5571edf3a716cf0e4b7b8c/0_0_1080_1466/737.jpg\" alt=\"chill writer instagram illustratino\" width=\"737\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>But these two imperatives are increasingly inextricable. The internet has become what Tolentino, in our exchange, called \u201cpersona-based\u201d, which has sometimes worked to her advantage. \u201cHaving come into media outside New York, with no connections and no experience, I\u2019ve always been aware that I owe a lot of my career to the fact that my temperament, my self, and my life all map well and easily onto the persona-based internet,\u201d she wrote, \u201cwhich has become a horrible substitute for a safety net for a lot of people, from medical GoFundMes to personal brands.\u201d</p> <p>One must have a persona on the persona-based internet, but the persona must be honest, or at least maintain the appearance of honesty. The cultural critic Sarah Nicole Prickett expressed a shrugging ambivalence on the matter of her public persona in an interview with <a href=\"http://maskmagazine.com/the-persona-issue/life/sarah-nicole-prickett\">Mask Magazine</a>. \u201cI very much have a public persona, even though it\u2019s a small public, but I feel detached from it,\u201d she told Mask\u2019s co-founding editor Hanna Hurr, who had asked about Prickett\u2019s Instagram presence, a cavalcade of sultry selfies, gallery installation shots, and party documentation with more conventionally famous friends. \u201cIt\u2019s something I have, not something I am. It\u2019s not even something I feel like I made with any intent, which is also not something I\u2019m proud about.\u201d</p> <p>Gevinson echoed this insistence that existing online for her had never been a thing she agonized over. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought I could be myself in public pretty easily \u2013 by which I mean, speak without second-guessing myself too much on social media, in writing, in interviews.\u201d Artifice was not just absent from her online persona; it was something she feared and actively avoided. \u201cI never considered myself calculating \u2013 who does? \u2013 and when I did catch glimpses of my own ambition, I thought it was ugly, disgraceful, incongruous with my authentic self, who simply wanted to make things and connect with people and probably, one day, move to the woods.\u201d</p> <p>The great division between writers and influencers is the appearance of effort in exerting influence. It\u2019s never cool to look like you\u2019re trying too hard. Calloway raves about her shape-shifting acumen, her persona-building, her bottomless ambition to create herself for her own profit; Prickett professes to think very little about her persona, while posing for her own essay on structured denim in <a href=\"https://www.ssense.com/en-us/editorial/fashion/market-research-levis-capsule-collection\">SSENSE</a> and being featured as a <a href=\"https://www.maccosmetics.com/culture/scene-stealers/sarah-nicole-prickett\">\u201cscene stealer\u201d</a> by Mac Cosmetics. If the end result is the same, how much does the division matter?</p> <p>The writer-influencer\u2019s identity must be quickly identifiable by the consumer, distilled to a meme-like essence in which content is the same as form. The writing <em>is </em>lifestyle, and vice versa. Tolentino as a cool girl who plays beer pong and smokes a lot of weed. Prickett as an aloof and modelesque bohemian socialite. Fry as a funny and enviably fun-natured lover of all things lowbrow, proclaiming her obsessions with reality shows and random celebrities. Cat Marnell as a romantically messy party girl, a blonde and waifish Bukowski. Olivia Nuzzi as a shoeleather politico, the hot girl in a boy\u2019s club with the establishment boyfriend to match. Taffy Brodesser-Akner as likable and liked, relatable and intellectual at the same time, the woman who, right now, has it all. Taffy\u2019s (she can only be Taffy) enthusiasm is even raised as a curious anomaly in journalism; a <a href=\"https://punchdrink.com/articles/taffy-brodesser-akner-fleishman-is-in-trouble-anything-but-basic/\">Punch</a> profiler described her as \u201cbuoyant \u2013 a palpable, energetic presence that\u2019s difficult to square with the typical image of a lurking or inconspicuous reporter\u201d. In other words: <em>she doesn\u2019t even seem like a writer!</em></p> <p>As a writer without much in the way of influence, I see these women and I feel an imperative to find the thing about me that could best be underscored, amplified, and repeated across platforms, the fragment of self that could become persona. I do not believe any of them to be calculating persona-crafters \u2013 I take them at their word that what they present is authentic \u2013 but I believe they have a very useful instinct, in addition to their talent for writing, for precisely which parts of themselves to share and how. Frankly, I fear that is an instinct that I lack but would do well to cultivate. The media industry is less stable than ever, and the one safe strategy seems to be the commodification of personality, turning your voice into followers and paid subscribers that no CEO can take away. We are all but forced to make ourselves, not just our words, the thing we sell.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5ffa9a4e4dcec6d47d7e84841a5b1ae0a6a4bc4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5ffa9a4e4dcec6d47d7e84841a5b1ae0a6a4bc4/0_240_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Taffy Brodesser-Akner.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Taffy Brodesser-Akner.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ali Smith/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If we\u2019re lucky, like Tolentino said, the soul-crushing machine of self-promotion will come for us and the capitalist imperative we hate will become one with the art or work that we love. So maybe there\u2019s something to be said for throwing oneself into it wholeheartedly, without shame, maybe even skipping the part where you fritter away underpaid labor in the hopes that someone higher up will notice you. How many women wrote revealing first-person essays and came up empty handed? If we\u2019re not lucky, the machine doesn\u2019t come at all.</p> <h2><strong>Women as writers as influencers</strong></h2> <p>I\u2019m not immune to any of this. I am acutely aware that I lack Gevinson and Prickett and Fry\u2019s effortless knack at existing online \u2013 that I am neurotic and prone to self-doubt in a way that stifles organic self-expression \u2013 and that makes me anxious. Then I think about what it would mean to supplant that natural instinct with an intentionally crafted persona, and that makes me hate myself. I consider being more vulnerable on Twitter, then I consider all the ways in which that could backfire; I consider posting selfies; I consider writing personal essays and then I consider how all the ways I could mine my life for content make me want to crawl into a hole. The fact that all of the above is agonizing for me to think about makes me feel I am not cut out for this industry in its current state.</p> <p>I consider also how the women whose work I most admire, whose careers I most want to emulate, are also women who I want to <em>be</em>. Whether or not that is by design, I can\u2019t help but feel it is no small part of what continues to drive me to click on their links and buy their books.</p> <p>It does not escape me that I have been considering only women, that the question of how to optimally present oneself online feels distinctly feminine, and this feels unfair even as the skill is somewhat advantageous, but mostly it feels inevitable. We are socialized to be highly attuned to making ourselves palatable for an audience, to be pleasing to the eye and the ear. This is the case as much on Twitter and Instagram as the physical world. And so we are slotted into this category, seen as much for our apartments and outfits as our writing, left to compete on every level at once.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the hard-bitten male longform journalist posting Instagram stories of unknown jungles is not treated or viewed as an influencer; he doesn\u2019t even worry about his influence in the first place. Nor does the male blogger-turned-venture capitalist who tweets and podcasts constantly. Nor the male mid-level editor bragging about an obviously four-figure fashion purchase on social media. The age of the famous <a href=\"https://wwd.com/business-news/media/the-dudes-abide-3615935/\">\u201cdudeitor\u201d</a> \u2013 middle-aged bros casually dominating media in a laid-back, unaffected posture \u2013 is over, even though their domination no doubt remains in the background. (Anonymity is a luxury.) Instead we have the age of the woman writer-influencer, both journalist and celebrity.</p> <p>I\u2019m not sure that there\u2019s an answer here, only that while I wring my hands over whether to press send on a tweet or make my private Instagram public, Caroline Calloway is meeting with producers interested in turning her Insta-memoir into a movie. I still do not think she is primarily a writer. I do, however, think we have entered a point of no return in the realm of media-industry success that necessarily brings us closer to her than we would perhaps like to admit.</p> <p>Those who insist that the job of the writer is simply, only, to write are deluding themselves. Editors whose advice is to get off Twitter, put your head down, and do the work are missing something fundamental and indispensable about digital media. It\u2019s that all the things that invite derision for influencers \u2013 self-promotion, fishing for likes, posting about the minutiae of your life for relatability points \u2013 are also integral to the career of a writer online. At least if you want to be visited by that holy trinity when it comes time for your book launch, you must be an influencer in all the ways that matter.</p>",

      "bodyText": "This piece originally appeared in Study Hall. Caroline Calloway likes to be identified as a writer. She makes this abundantly clear in a post directed at Grace Spelman, formerly a content producer at BuzzFeed, during one of Calloway\u2019s many forgettable spats with media workers whose criticisms she has found chafing. \u201cFYI I prefer \u2018writer\u2019, like you, Grace,\u201d Calloway noted in a parenthetical within a wall of text (Spelman had called her an \u201cInstagram blogger\u201d, which, for my money, is pretty apt). Elsewhere on her Instagram, Calloway posts a picture of Trick Mirror, the lauded debut essay collection from the New Yorker writer Jia Tolentino. The book makes her \u201cinsecure\u201d, she writes, because she can\u2019t seem to measure up to Tolentino\u2019s pristine search results. \u201cWhen you type Jia Tolentino into Google you get: Great writer! Benefit of the doubt! Kind assumptions! Media EGOT!\u201d She contrasts this apparent luck with her own results, which yield unsparing (and, frankly, excessive) coverage of some poorly planned \u201ccreativity workshops\u201d consisting of flower crowns, salads, and organized vulnerability. Calloway\u2019s writerly ambition had been to document her life in real time on a platform best known for sharing selfies, to pioneer a new genre of memoir while cultivating a loyal social media following. She had secured a book deal at one point but wasn\u2019t able to deliver due to a worsening addiction to Adderall, so Instagram remained her literary venue of choice. And why not? Many writers \u2013 good writers \u2013 self-publish via newsletters or blogging platforms; the choice of the photo-centric Instagram merely makes the writer\u2019s intentions of self-commodification more straightforward. There could not be any confusion about what was being sold: not just prose, but the person herself. But to describe Calloway as a writer first and foremost would be extraordinarily generous. Her frenzied, disjointed dispatches beneath photos of her art-cluttered West Village studio floor are, in and of themselves, often myopic and uninteresting. It is the media-fueled mythos around her \u2013 the disintegrated book deal, the \u201cscam\u201d workshops, the sensational and damning the Cut essay from her former best friend and collaborator Natalie Beach \u2013 that have earned my attention and emotional investment. To my shame, I read every word Calloway writes. But perhaps Calloway could be forgiven for conflating the work of writing with the work of marketing oneself as a writer. After all, to be a writer today is to make yourself a product for public consumption on the internet, to project an appealing image that contextualizes the actual writing. The women \u2013 and they are mostly women \u2013 who are most heralded in the media industry today are extremely online, starring in photoshoots and documenting their skincare routines and eating habits as much as discussing their process. The influencer is insecure about not being the writer. But over this past summer of viral internet-fueled grifts and an equally intense barrage of high-profile book launches and interview tours, it struck me that there is functionally little difference between a lauded writer with a recognizable avatar and a prominent social-media influencer. The only difference is in the way each metabolizes the experience of influence. Self-conscious authenticity The most famous writers have always been public figures with their own media-fueled mythos, of course. We have the glamorous mystique of Joan Didion, whose aspirational \u201ccool\u201d has made her a persistent object of reverence for white women with literary ambitions; the wild lore of Hunter S Thompson with his drugs and guns, the cigarette holder and aviators instantly recognizable even to those who haven\u2019t read him; and the literary \u201cBrat Pack\u201d of Bret Easton Ellis, Jay McInerney, and company, who were themselves objects of fascination as extensions of their depressive, decadent, druggy fiction. Benjamin Moser\u2019s new authorized biography of Susan Sontag painstakingly attempts to reconcile the writer\u2019s contradictory private self with her glamorous persona as a public intellectual. The book\u2019s many reviews grapple with the unreliability of biographical interpretation and the insertions of the biographer\u2019s own biases and blindspots. But the image management that once seemed incidental, or at least parallel, to the literary profession seems now one of its most necessary, integral functions. In the age of Twitter and Instagram, an online presence, which is necessarily public and necessarily consumable, seems all but mandatory for a writer who reaches (or hopes to reach) a certain level of renown, especially for anyone dealing in personal essays or cultural criticism. In the way that the influencer uses her image to sell her swag, the writer leverages her life to sell her work, to editors and audiences. Naomi Fry, known for her sharp dissections of celebrity, social media, and meme culture at the New Yorker, is perhaps equally known for her own social media presence as a funny, astute documentarian of her personal life, though always within the context of her job at a prestige publication and with more than a whiff of irony. If celebrities who play well on social media do so by being funny and relatable but more glamorous than you, writers who play well on those same platforms do so by being funny and relatable but smarter and more successful than you. Last year, Fry gave an interview to the Caret, a tech publication that interviews \u201cinnovators and visionaries shaping the digital landscape\u201d, in which she took stock of her modest internet fame and connection to influencer culture. \u201cWhen it comes to so-called \u2018personal brand building\u2019, even when you don\u2019t think you\u2019re doing it, you\u2019re still kind of doing it,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I\u2019m not going to pretend it\u2019s something I\u2019m not totally aware of, as anyone on social media is. But I think it\u2019s true that I have no interest in presenting my life in a way that\u2019s idealized.\u201d Indeed, who in the irony-soaked world of New York media does? For all our talk of Instagram as a vehicle for curating an idealized self, we know grainy displays of self-awareness are the real ticket \u2013 filterless, sparse bathroom mirror selfies are infinitely cooler than the obviously posed and airbrushed. They denote a certain status, in fact, that comes with being in on the collective joke, with understanding the illusory nature of the medium and making use of it in a wry punchline at your own expense. You don\u2019t have to look talented or elegant online \u2013 as long as you are, or could be. If you aren\u2019t already (internet-)famous, the lack of idealization, or the appearance thereof, could hurt you in the eyes of your peers or bosses. This is not a concern for the writer-influencer. On social media they joke about not writing, about their elaborate procrastination techniques, about getting high, about angsting to their therapists who don\u2019t understand the internet. Like descendants of Carrie Bradshaw in her apartment with its designer shoe-filled oven, they are performatively, romantically messy. I couldn\u2019t help but wonder: if this self-consciously unadorned authenticity \u2013 the thing supposedly separating writers from the polished Instagram influencers they critique \u2013 yields status, followers, and an aspirational yearning in their fans, what\u2019s the difference? Intention to influence As digital journalism has converged with influencer culture, a whole genre of coverage has sprung up to account for it, including breathless book-launch coverage around star authors that feels more like celebrity voyeurism. We want to know what and how writers eat, which skincare products they smear on their faces, and what they\u2019re reading when they\u2019re not writing. And so we have the debut writer\u2019s holy trinity of New York Magazine\u2019s Grub Street Diet, Into the Gloss\u2019s Top Shelf, and the New York Times\u2019s By the Book. Jia Tolentino checked all of these boxes throughout her very visible book publicity tour over the summer \u2013 a relentless whirlwind of glowing press \u2013 and made self-deprecating jokes about saturating our newsfeeds (which felt very much in keeping with her public image we had come to know through these dispatches). I asked Tolentino in an email about this exposure, about the cultivation of a public persona online, and the degree to which she goes about doing so consciously. She responded that she had been thinking about the question a lot lately, as she\u2019d been \u201cstrapped to the soul-crushing (if also very fortunate) machine of book promotion\u201d. She is distressed by the imperative to commodify herself to sell her work, but it is something she recognizes as inescapable. \u201cA good amount of my book is about how capitalism, the internet, the monetized self are all destructive to our functioning as real humans; yet, the better I express those ideas, the better I become a marketable object myself,\u201d Tolentino explained. \u201cI\u2019ve spent a lot of time, while promoting Trick Mirror, wondering if the work that brings me the most meaning in life (writing) will always necessarily bring me deeper into the clutches of the things that I hate (capitalism, and a way of being in which external incentives seem more important than internal ones).\u201d She tries to navigate her life online \u201cunconsciously, instinctively\u201d, and without losing sight of the fact that her real life is more important than what she projects to an audience. \u201cOne of the worst things that the internet does is make us value representations of a thing over the actual thing itself, and I think I just try to stay tight to that understanding \u2013 that my actual self and life are a lot more important to me than the online representation of such, that my work is more important to me than any public idea of that work.\u201d Tavi Gevinson, the polymathic founder of Rookie, grapples with this duality between the work and the worker\u2019s persona in a New York Magazine cover story on how Instagram fame shaped her sense of self and her career alike. \u201cI think I am a writer and an actor and an artist,\u201d she writes. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t believed the purity of my own intentions ever since I became my own salesperson, too.\u201d The more she focuses on her own work, embracing the archetype of the writer rather than the influencer, the farther away she stays from Instagram, delegating updates to an assistant. But when it comes to the commodification of the self, the work and the public idea of the work are often conflated, just as the internet flattens everything else. It\u2019s harder to separate the art from the artist, or the artist\u2019s skincare. Maybe that is the natural endpoint of the influencer\u2019s internet. Caroline Calloway\u2019s great project is, ultimately, making her inner life into what she calls \u201cdigital art\u201d, her life and its representation one glorious entangled mess. She has pursued the solidification of a public idea first and foremost; the body of work she has amassed in her posts project the persona she has made for herself. She knows she is a salesperson \u2013 both of Matisse knockoffs and of her actual self \u2013 and not only bluntly admits it but confidently conflates it with her creativity. The self-disclosure required of an influencer whose brand is vulnerability, already unsettlingly close to the work-mandated social-media shilling required of most writers, can become almost indistinguishable from the work of an essayist who deals in the personal. In this way, the influencer could simply be a digital update of the confessional writer. Shannon Keating at BuzzFeed recently wrote an essay exploring how the Calloway phenomenon has prompted her to re-examine her choice to write first-person essays. She draws a line, as I also did, from the dusk of the \u201cfirst-person industrial complex\u201d to the dawn of the influencer, what she considers to be an \u201ceven more complicated and ethically murky digital economy of self-exposure and service content\u201d, spawned by a desperation for a clearly defined sense of identity. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for answers,\u201d writes Keating. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for relatable (or even better, aspirational) role models who are willing to open their lives up to us for inspection, and social media has spawned an endless supply of them.\u201d (It\u2019s an arc that can be traced back to Emily Gould in the early days of Gawker, who documented her experience in a 2008 New York Times Magazine essay.) The root of all this angst: Keating had recently written a viral essay for BuzzFeed about falling in love on a lesbian cruise, and the effects of that virality had rendered her a de facto influencer, which troubled her. Had she, through the act of writing, made her personal life into a public commodity? \u201cThe last thing I wanted was to turn Lynette and me into some sort of lesbian influencer couple, selling us as a desirable product \u2026 I\u2019d much rather people check up on me to read my latest article, not to learn whether or not I\u2019m still with my girlfriend,\u201d she writes. \u201cBut as someone who mines her own life for content \u2013 who always has and probably always will \u2013 I know that\u2019s a ridiculous thing to wish for.\u201d Calloway, for her part, does not seem conflicted about her self-exposure in the slightest; nor, really, does the journalist Lauren Duca, whose aggressive personal branding has propelled her to the level of living meme. Duca got famous for a Teen Vogue piece that, for better or worse, reintroduced the term \u201cgaslighting\u201d into our political and personal nomenclature, but equally for calling Tucker Carlson a \u201csexist pig\u201d as her mic was cut. Then she sold T-shirts emblazoned with a catchphrase borrowed from Carlson\u2019s sexist rant. Still, she insists her public presence isn\u2019t self-aggrandizing. She is furious at any comparisons between herself and Calloway, claiming they overshadow her \u201cserious and important work\u201d. But that work, at least after the initial Teen Vogue salvos and TV appearances, has undoubtedly been overshadowed by her own labor of peddling a persona. Like Calloway, Duca has drawn hundreds of thousands of followers not just through a body of writing but through the projection of a lifestyle that appears compelling in a not particularly radical or innovative way. Highly paid talks, university teaching gigs, big book deals, and sassy clapback-style tweets is a pretty uncontroversial vision of success as a journalist that many of us would like to copy, whatever we think of Duca herself. But all of this external posturing has overshadowed any actual reportage: at some point, the \u201cwork\u201d becomes the continued maintenance of the image. The anxiety of influencing To truly contend with a term I suppose we should define it. A social media influencer, according to the Digital Marketing Institute, is simply \u201ca user who has established credibility in a specific industry, has access to a huge audience and can persuade others to act based on their recommendations\u201d. This is a broad definition that could encompass everyone from Chrissy Teigen (a celebrity who effectively markets her relatability) to Shaun King (another alleged grifter). When encountering the influencer, we must therefore determine how their credibility was established, in which specific industry, and to what end they deploy their powers of persuasion. The answers to those questions determine whether we view a person online as worthy of our reverence or our scorn. We can accept Jia Tolentino\u2019s skincare tips because we know the work at the core of this brand is as solid as it gets, whereas Caroline Calloway becomes a punchline, because even the content that did exist was a ghostwritten illusion. The problem comes down to the way we view work, and what we view as \u201cwork\u201d in the first place. There is a perception that to simply exist in public space, to influence by living, is not work at all. These influencers who produce photos of themselves, who turn their wider lives into content rather than confining themselves to a byline, are thus dismissed as vapid and shallow, sources of pleasure and no more. The writer, by contrast, is viewed primarily as a purveyor of intellect and meritorious beauty. The writer gives us art, gives us insight and rigor, contextualizes the phenomena that confound us. Their labor is seen as more valid. But these two imperatives are increasingly inextricable. The internet has become what Tolentino, in our exchange, called \u201cpersona-based\u201d, which has sometimes worked to her advantage. \u201cHaving come into media outside New York, with no connections and no experience, I\u2019ve always been aware that I owe a lot of my career to the fact that my temperament, my self, and my life all map well and easily onto the persona-based internet,\u201d she wrote, \u201cwhich has become a horrible substitute for a safety net for a lot of people, from medical GoFundMes to personal brands.\u201d One must have a persona on the persona-based internet, but the persona must be honest, or at least maintain the appearance of honesty. The cultural critic Sarah Nicole Prickett expressed a shrugging ambivalence on the matter of her public persona in an interview with Mask Magazine. \u201cI very much have a public persona, even though it\u2019s a small public, but I feel detached from it,\u201d she told Mask\u2019s co-founding editor Hanna Hurr, who had asked about Prickett\u2019s Instagram presence, a cavalcade of sultry selfies, gallery installation shots, and party documentation with more conventionally famous friends. \u201cIt\u2019s something I have, not something I am. It\u2019s not even something I feel like I made with any intent, which is also not something I\u2019m proud about.\u201d Gevinson echoed this insistence that existing online for her had never been a thing she agonized over. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought I could be myself in public pretty easily \u2013 by which I mean, speak without second-guessing myself too much on social media, in writing, in interviews.\u201d Artifice was not just absent from her online persona; it was something she feared and actively avoided. \u201cI never considered myself calculating \u2013 who does? \u2013 and when I did catch glimpses of my own ambition, I thought it was ugly, disgraceful, incongruous with my authentic self, who simply wanted to make things and connect with people and probably, one day, move to the woods.\u201d The great division between writers and influencers is the appearance of effort in exerting influence. It\u2019s never cool to look like you\u2019re trying too hard. Calloway raves about her shape-shifting acumen, her persona-building, her bottomless ambition to create herself for her own profit; Prickett professes to think very little about her persona, while posing for her own essay on structured denim in SSENSE and being featured as a \u201cscene stealer\u201d by Mac Cosmetics. If the end result is the same, how much does the division matter? The writer-influencer\u2019s identity must be quickly identifiable by the consumer, distilled to a meme-like essence in which content is the same as form. The writing is lifestyle, and vice versa. Tolentino as a cool girl who plays beer pong and smokes a lot of weed. Prickett as an aloof and modelesque bohemian socialite. Fry as a funny and enviably fun-natured lover of all things lowbrow, proclaiming her obsessions with reality shows and random celebrities. Cat Marnell as a romantically messy party girl, a blonde and waifish Bukowski. Olivia Nuzzi as a shoeleather politico, the hot girl in a boy\u2019s club with the establishment boyfriend to match. Taffy Brodesser-Akner as likable and liked, relatable and intellectual at the same time, the woman who, right now, has it all. Taffy\u2019s (she can only be Taffy) enthusiasm is even raised as a curious anomaly in journalism; a Punch profiler described her as \u201cbuoyant \u2013 a palpable, energetic presence that\u2019s difficult to square with the typical image of a lurking or inconspicuous reporter\u201d. In other words: she doesn\u2019t even seem like a writer! As a writer without much in the way of influence, I see these women and I feel an imperative to find the thing about me that could best be underscored, amplified, and repeated across platforms, the fragment of self that could become persona. I do not believe any of them to be calculating persona-crafters \u2013 I take them at their word that what they present is authentic \u2013 but I believe they have a very useful instinct, in addition to their talent for writing, for precisely which parts of themselves to share and how. Frankly, I fear that is an instinct that I lack but would do well to cultivate. The media industry is less stable than ever, and the one safe strategy seems to be the commodification of personality, turning your voice into followers and paid subscribers that no CEO can take away. We are all but forced to make ourselves, not just our words, the thing we sell. If we\u2019re lucky, like Tolentino said, the soul-crushing machine of self-promotion will come for us and the capitalist imperative we hate will become one with the art or work that we love. So maybe there\u2019s something to be said for throwing oneself into it wholeheartedly, without shame, maybe even skipping the part where you fritter away underpaid labor in the hopes that someone higher up will notice you. How many women wrote revealing first-person essays and came up empty handed? If we\u2019re not lucky, the machine doesn\u2019t come at all. Women as writers as influencers I\u2019m not immune to any of this. I am acutely aware that I lack Gevinson and Prickett and Fry\u2019s effortless knack at existing online \u2013 that I am neurotic and prone to self-doubt in a way that stifles organic self-expression \u2013 and that makes me anxious. Then I think about what it would mean to supplant that natural instinct with an intentionally crafted persona, and that makes me hate myself. I consider being more vulnerable on Twitter, then I consider all the ways in which that could backfire; I consider posting selfies; I consider writing personal essays and then I consider how all the ways I could mine my life for content make me want to crawl into a hole. The fact that all of the above is agonizing for me to think about makes me feel I am not cut out for this industry in its current state. I consider also how the women whose work I most admire, whose careers I most want to emulate, are also women who I want to be. Whether or not that is by design, I can\u2019t help but feel it is no small part of what continues to drive me to click on their links and buy their books. It does not escape me that I have been considering only women, that the question of how to optimally present oneself online feels distinctly feminine, and this feels unfair even as the skill is somewhat advantageous, but mostly it feels inevitable. We are socialized to be highly attuned to making ourselves palatable for an audience, to be pleasing to the eye and the ear. This is the case as much on Twitter and Instagram as the physical world. And so we are slotted into this category, seen as much for our apartments and outfits as our writing, left to compete on every level at once. Meanwhile, the hard-bitten male longform journalist posting Instagram stories of unknown jungles is not treated or viewed as an influencer; he doesn\u2019t even worry about his influence in the first place. Nor does the male blogger-turned-venture capitalist who tweets and podcasts constantly. Nor the male mid-level editor bragging about an obviously four-figure fashion purchase on social media. The age of the famous \u201cdudeitor\u201d \u2013 middle-aged bros casually dominating media in a laid-back, unaffected posture \u2013 is over, even though their domination no doubt remains in the background. (Anonymity is a luxury.) Instead we have the age of the woman writer-influencer, both journalist and celebrity. I\u2019m not sure that there\u2019s an answer here, only that while I wring my hands over whether to press send on a tweet or make my private Instagram public, Caroline Calloway is meeting with producers interested in turning her Insta-memoir into a movie. I still do not think she is primarily a writer. I do, however, think we have entered a point of no return in the realm of media-industry success that necessarily brings us closer to her than we would perhaps like to admit. Those who insist that the job of the writer is simply, only, to write are deluding themselves. Editors whose advice is to get off Twitter, put your head down, and do the work are missing something fundamental and indispensable about digital media. It\u2019s that all the things that invite derision for influencers \u2013 self-promotion, fishing for likes, posting about the minutiae of your life for relatability points \u2013 are also integral to the career of a writer online. At least if you want to be visited by that holy trinity when it comes time for your book launch, you must be an influencer in all the ways that matter.",

Meanwhile, every week seems to bring signs that the companies\u2019 old veneer of invincibility is cracking, something vividly highlighted by the mounting crises befalling Facebook\u2019s hubristic plans for a new online currency, which Zuckerberg will try to explain to a congressional committee this week. Big tech\u2019s lobbyists are clearly readying themselves for a series of showdowns about the extent of its power. The key problem comes down to the difficulty of pursuing big tech in a world that it not only controls, but defines. We read about Warren and Vestager on the same feeds that dissolve even the best intentions into the usual meaningless noise. But, on a good day, what seems to be happening brings to mind the call to action that concludes Shoshana Zuboff\u2019s The Age of Surveillance Capitalism. \u201cIt is up to us to use our knowledge, to regain our bearings, to stir others to do the same, and to found a new beginning,\u201d she says. Maybe \u2013 just maybe \u2013 we are starting to see what that might look like in practice. \u2022 John Harris is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "Global supplies of renewable electricity are growing faster than expected and could expand by 50% in the next five years, powered by a resurgence in solar energy. The International Energy Agency (IEA) found that solar, wind and hydropower projects are rolling out at their fastest rate in four years. Its latest report predicts that by 2024 a new dawn for cheap solar power could see the world\u2019s solar capacity grow by 600GW, almost double the installed total electricity capacity of Japan. Overall, renewable electricity is expected to grow by 1,200GW in the next five years, the equivalent of the total electricity capacity of the US. \u201cThis is a pivotal time for renewable energy,\u201d said the IEA\u2019s executive director, Fatih Birol. \u201cTechnologies such as solar photovoltaics (PV) and wind are at the heart of transformations taking place across the global energy system. Their increasing deployment is crucial for efforts to tackle greenhouse gas emissions, reduce air pollution, and expand energy access.\u201d The Guardian reported earlier this month that a renewable energy revolution could end the world\u2019s rising demand for oil and coal in the 2020s, decades ahead of forecasts from oil and mining companies. Renewable energy sources make up 26% of the world\u2019s electricity today, but according to the IEA its share is expected to reach 30% by 2024. The resurgence follows a global slowdown last year, due to falling technology costs and rising environmental concerns. However, Birol warned that the role of renewables in the global energy system would need to grow even faster if the world hopes to meet its climate targets. The report said growing climate ambitions in the European Union and the US played the biggest role in driving the IEA\u2019s forecasts higher, but it will be China which leads the way in rolling out wind and solar energy projects. The IEA expects solar energy to play the biggest role in jumpstarting fresh growth in global renewable energy because falling costs are already below retail electricity prices in most countries. The cost of solar power is expected to decline by a further 15% to 35% by 2024, spurring further growth over the second half of the decade. The appetite of energy-hungry businesses and factories is expected to be the biggest driver of the solar power boom as company bosses exploit falling costs to help cut their energy bills. But the number of home solar panels is also expected to more than double to reach around 100m rooftops by 2024, with the strongest per capita growth in Australia, Belgium, California, the Netherlands and Austria. Even after the \u201cspectacular\u201d growth expected for solar over the next five years, panels will cover only 6% of the world\u2019s available rooftops, leaving room for further growth. \u201cRenewables are already the world\u2019s second largest source of electricity, but their deployment still needs to accelerate if we are to achieve long-term climate, air quality and energy access goals,\u201d Birol said. He warned that although the potential for solar power was \u201cbreathtaking\u201d the rapid rollout could disrupt electricity markets unless regulators and utilities adapt.",

      "bodyText": "Members of Northern Ireland\u2019s assembly are due to return to the mothballed chamber on Monday for the first time in almost three years to protest against the extension of abortion rights to Northern Ireland. The Democratic Unionist party (DUP) and other anti-abortion members will stage what is expected to be a largely symbolic recall of the assembly at Stormont. The region\u2019s near-blanket ban on abortion is due to end at midnight on Monday after a historic vote in the House of Commons last July to bring Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the UK. Last week the anti-abortion campaign group Both Lives Matter said 31 members of the legislative assembly (MLAs), including 27 from the DUP, signed a petition to force a recall to discuss a motion to put abortion rights back in the hands of local politicians. However to block the law the special sitting will need to elect a speaker and form an executive, which would require Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s support. Sinn F\u00e9in \u2013 along with the Alliance party \u2013 said it would not participate, leaving the anti-abortion gathering devoid of power. Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, said the recall would allow MLAs to register opposition to the law. \u201cHopefully we will be able to debate the issue,\u201d she said. Several unionists from other parties backed the petition: Jim Allister of Traditional Unionist Voice, alongside Robin Swann, the leader of the Ulster Unionist party (UUP) and his party colleagues Robbie Butler and Roy Beggs. The initiative came from former police ombudsman Nuala O\u2019Loan, who wrote a letter to Julian Smith, the Northern Ireland secretary, requesting a recall before the abortion law change. Same-sex marriage is also due to become legal on Tuesday after a separate Westminster vote in July. The first weddings can take place on Valentine\u2019s Day next year. Non-unionist parties criticised the recall. A Sinn F\u00e9in spokesperson called it \u201ca pointless political stunt which has literally no impact, unless its business is to appoint an executive who does have the power to effect legal change\u201d. Colum Eastwood, the SDLP leader, also called it a stunt and said the legislation on abortion and same-sex marriage would take effect. Eastwood did not indicate whether the party would attend. One SDLP MLA, Daniel McCrossan, said he would attend. Stephen Farry, an Alliance party MLA, told the BBC: \u201cI\u2019m profoundly uncomfortable that the first time people are making an effort to have the assembly reconvened is to discuss how we can deny people rights.\u201d Stormont collapsed in January 2017 amid disputes between the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in, leaving a political vacuum. Despite mounting frustration efforts to revive it have failed. Long campaigns by equality campaigners culminated in two Labour MPs, Stella Creasy and Conor McGinn, tabling amendments on abortion and same-sex marriage to an otherwise technical government bill connected to budgets and elections for the defunct assembly. In free votes, because they were viewed as matters of conscience, the Commons voted overwhelmingly for both. On the eve of this week\u2019s vote on Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal, Creasy accused Downing Street of preparing to hand back control of abortion rights to Stormont to help curry favour with the DUP. If there was such a plan it failed: the DUP rejected Johnson\u2019s deal.

      "bodyText": "John Lewis and Waitrose are to stop selling Christmas crackers containing plastic toys and puzzles as part of a drive to reduce single-use plastics \u2013 but not until 2020. The retailers will announce on Monday that they would switch next year to crackers filled with toys and other items made from recyclable materials such as metal and paper, with the cardboard wrappers embossed rather than decorated with plastic glitter. With 65 days to go until Christmas, John Lewis has also joined the wider crackdown on glitter by reducing the the amount used to decorate its own-brand range of Christmas wrapping paper, gift bags and tags, advent calendars and crackers by two-thirds. Standard glitter is made from etched aluminium bonded to polyethylene terephthalate \u2013 a form of damaging microplastic that can enter the oceans and pose a danger to people and animals. Environmental campaigners have described the product \u2013 popular at Christmas to add sparkle to stationery and decorations \u2013 as an environmental scourge and called for it to be banned. Leading retailers have argued it is difficult to change product lines quickly as they are typically ordered more than a year in advance. Dan Cooper, the head Christmas buyer at John Lewis, said: \u201cReducing the amount of single-use plastic in products and packaging is really important to us and our customers. One of the challenges I face as a buyer is that we plan 18 months ahead, so it takes time for changes to become a reality. I\u2019m always searching for new, more sustainable products which will make Christmas sparkle but won\u2019t end up spoiling our environment.\u201d This year, the retailer is selling three designs of \u201cfill your own\u201d crackers, which are becoming its most popular crackers, accounting for one in every three packets sold. Separately, it has removed the plastic wrapping from most individual cards it sells, which it estimates will save 8 tonnes of plastic a year. In December last year, Waitrose was the first leading UK retailer to pledge to ban glitter from all own-brand products. The supermarket chain said its own-label cards, wraps, crackers, tags, flowers and plants would either be glitter-free or use an environmentally friendly alternative by 2020. Tesco has switched to a plastic-free version for its Christmas trees, plants and flowers this year, also removing it from this year\u2019s own-brand wrapping paper, tags and single Christmas cards. The discount chain Aldi has scrapped plastic glitter from this year\u2019s Halloween range as well as from festive cards and wrapping paper. In August, Marks &amp; Spencer announced it was banning glitter from this year\u2019s Christmas cards, wrapping paper, calendars and crackers. Supermarkets are reflecting wider moves in society, with the BBC TV show Strictly Come Dancing banning the use of traditional glitter last year and growing numbers of nursery schools and music festivals also ending their use of the product.",

The surprising new source of \u201cgravity energy\u201d is being developed by Gravitricity, an Edinburgh-based startup, which hopes to use Britain\u2019s old mines to make better use of clean electricity at half the cost of lithium-ion batteries. Gravitricity said its system effectively stores energy by using electric winches to hoist the weights to the top of the shaft when there is plenty of renewable energy available, then dropping the weights hundreds of metres down vertical shafts to generate electricity when needed. The scheme mimics hydropower projects which have played a key role in helping to balance the electricity grid, including the Dinorwig project in Wales. Charlie Blair, Gravitricity\u2019s managing director, said: \u201cThe beauty of this is that this can be done multiple times a day for many years, without any loss of performance. This makes it very competitive against other forms of energy storage \u2013 including lithium-ion batteries.\u201d A full-scale project would drop 24 weights totalling 12,000 tonnes to a depth of 800 metres to produce enough electricity to power 63,000 homes for more than an hour. By carefully controlling the winches Gravitricity said it could extend this period by allowing the weights to fall at a slower rate and release electricity over a longer period. The company is currently in discussion with mine owners in the UK, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic and South Africa, where mine shafts could be more than 2,000 metres deep. Oliver Schmidt, the lead author of Imperial\u2019s report, said Gravitricity\u2019s model is the most price competitive energy storage option because it has a relatively low upfront cost and a potential lifespan of more than 25 years. The report found that electricity released by a typical 10MW lithium-ion battery project would cost $367 (\u00a3283) per megawatt-hour over its lifetime compared with a cost of $171 (\u00a3132)/MWh for electricity from a Gravitricity project. Schmidt said: \u201cI don\u2019t expect Gravitricity to displace all lithium batteries on grids, but it certainly looks like a compelling proposition.\u201d The system was first developed by Gravitricity\u2019s founder, Peter Fraenkel, who also invented the world\u2019s first full-scale tidal energy turbines.

News of the AFP\u2019s internal assessment came as Scott Morrison declared on Monday that while he supported press freedom, journalists were not above the law. The prime minister then said decisions about who should be prosecuted after an unauthorised disclosure should not be made \u201con the whim of politicians\u201d. The current system gives the attorney general capacity to send a direction to the Commonwealth director of public prosecutions and request they seek consent before a prosecution. The attorney general, Christian Porter, signed a directive to the Commonwealth DPP on 19 September. On Sunday, Porter told the ABC he would be \u201cseriously disinclined\u201d to sign off on the criminal prosecution of journalists after recent controversial police raids on News Corp and the ABC, but he did not give a guarantee. The AFP has not ruled out charging journalists targeted in the recent raids, despite the public-interest nature of their reporting. The search warrants used in the raids are being challenged in court. The new AFP commissioner, Reece Kershaw, told a Senate estimates hearing in Canberra on Monday he had enlisted a former chair of the Australian Crime Commission, John Lawler, to examine how the police dealt with unauthorised disclosures, espionage and foreign interference, war crimes and the application of parliamentary privilege. Kershaw\u2019s appearance coincided with a public campaign by major media outlets. The front page of every daily Australian newspaper was blacked out on Monday as part of a campaign against moves by successive governments to penalise whistleblowing and, in some cases, criminalise journalism. The campaign, spearheaded by the Australia\u2019s Right to Know Coalition, follows raids on the ABC\u2019s Sydney headquarters and the home of a News Corp journalist, Annika Smethurst, in June. Kershaw, during his Senate estimates appearance, was shown Monday\u2019s redacted front pages by the Labor senator Kristina Keneally, but the commissioner said he hadn\u2019t yet considered whether the media pushback was connected to controversy about the raids. He said he had good relationships with the media, but intended to have discussions with editors and journalists given the dissatisfaction in the industry. The commissioner said the process to be undertaken by Lawler was not a review of current matters but the development of a \u201cholistic approach to ensure we have in place investigative policy and guidelines that are fit for purpose\u201d. Lawler, the commissioner said, would provide options to ensure the police were \u201cbest placed to address sensitive investigations into the future\u201d. The review will be completed in January next year. Kershaw was challenged during his appearance on Monday to explain why the AFP appeared to persist with investigations into leaks that the government considered damaging, while dropping other investigations, including a probe into the leaking of a home affairs brief about the medevac regime to the Australian newspaper, which was helpful to the government. The police commissioner said the investigation of the leak to the Australian had been dropped because there was a limited prospect of securing a conviction, because 200 people had access to the brief in draft, and the final version had been sent to 11 email addresses. \u201cWe are not a political organisation,\u201d Kershaw said. \u201cWe are a police force. We don\u2019t play politics. It is not our role.\u201d",

Nowell missed the quarter-final victory over Australia with a hamstring injury but England are optimistic he will be in contention to face the All Blacks in Yokohama on Saturday.</p> <p>Nowell\u2019s return would be timely for England, given Jonny May twinged his hamstring in the final minutes against the Wallabies, but the assistant coach Neal Hatley is also hopeful over the Leicester winger and has predicted that Eddie Jones will have a full squad of 31 to choose from.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/20/kyle-sinckler-england-australia-rugby-world-cup-quarter-finals\">England\u2019s Kyle Sinckler hits self-control switch to frustrate the baiters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nowell has endured a frustrating World Cup so far \u2013 having finally recovered from the ankle injury he suffered in the Premiership final at the start of June, he made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/05/england-argentina-rugby-world-cup-2019-pool-c-match-report\">a try-scoring cameo against Argentina</a> in the pool stage but soon picked up his latest injury. Jones had said on Sunday that Nowell will need to come through England\u2019s first major training session of the week on Tuesday to be considered and while that is still likely to be the case, Hatley offered a more bullish assessment.</p> <p>\u201cWe expect Jack to be fit for selection,\u201d said Hatley. \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic where we are, all 31 being available for selection at the end of the week. [May] is bouncing around this morning. He has a small twinge and we\u2019ll assess where he is a little bit later today. He\u2019s in really good spirits, moving well.\u201d</p> <p>Nowell\u2019s availability would offer England another option in their back-three department as they plot the downfall of the two-times reigning world champions. Both May, who scored two tries, and Anthony Watson, who added England\u2019s fourth late on, excelled on Saturday but Jones values Nowell\u2019s work-rate highly.</p> <p>England have never beaten New Zealand at the World Cup, losing on their three previous meetings in 1991, 1995 and 1999, and the All Blacks have not lost a match at the tournament since 2007. In their only match against New Zealand under Jones, England went down to a 16-15 defeat last autumn. The All Blacks also underlined that they remain the team to beat with their crushing 46-14 win over Ireland on Saturday.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/20/all-blacks-best-team-ever-beatable-eddie-jones-rugby-world-cup\">All Blacks are best sports team ever but beatable, says Eddie Jones</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThey are dangerous from all over the pitch,\u201d added Hatley. \u201c[They have a] good set-piece, I thought they defended really well and they took their chances \u2013 they are clinical when they get opportunities. It\u2019s not something we haven\u2019t seen from them before, I think they\u2019ve done that through most of the last year so we understand the importance of looking after the ball.</p> <p>\u201cSome sides are about a really solid set-piece, others more about attack. They\u2019ve got a pretty all-round game. Their set-piece game is strong, their transitions are strong, they defend exceptionally well with a lot of intent. Eddie talked about it, they\u2019ve got a proud win record. I don\u2019t there is one area that they are brilliant in but they are pretty good across most of the areas.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "England expect to have Jack Nowell fit and available for selection for this weekend\u2019s World Cup semi-final against New Zealand. Nowell missed the quarter-final victory over Australia with a hamstring injury but England are optimistic he will be in contention to face the All Blacks in Yokohama on Saturday. Nowell\u2019s return would be timely for England, given Jonny May twinged his hamstring in the final minutes against the Wallabies, but the assistant coach Neal Hatley is also hopeful over the Leicester winger and has predicted that Eddie Jones will have a full squad of 31 to choose from. Nowell has endured a frustrating World Cup so far \u2013 having finally recovered from the ankle injury he suffered in the Premiership final at the start of June, he made a try-scoring cameo against Argentina in the pool stage but soon picked up his latest injury. Jones had said on Sunday that Nowell will need to come through England\u2019s first major training session of the week on Tuesday to be considered and while that is still likely to be the case, Hatley offered a more bullish assessment. \u201cWe expect Jack to be fit for selection,\u201d said Hatley. \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic where we are, all 31 being available for selection at the end of the week. [May] is bouncing around this morning. He has a small twinge and we\u2019ll assess where he is a little bit later today. He\u2019s in really good spirits, moving well.\u201d Nowell\u2019s availability would offer England another option in their back-three department as they plot the downfall of the two-times reigning world champions. Both May, who scored two tries, and Anthony Watson, who added England\u2019s fourth late on, excelled on Saturday but Jones values Nowell\u2019s work-rate highly. England have never beaten New Zealand at the World Cup, losing on their three previous meetings in 1991, 1995 and 1999, and the All Blacks have not lost a match at the tournament since 2007. In their only match against New Zealand under Jones, England went down to a 16-15 defeat last autumn. The All Blacks also underlined that they remain the team to beat with their crushing 46-14 win over Ireland on Saturday. \u201cThey are dangerous from all over the pitch,\u201d added Hatley. \u201c[They have a] good set-piece, I thought they defended really well and they took their chances \u2013 they are clinical when they get opportunities. It\u2019s not something we haven\u2019t seen from them before, I think they\u2019ve done that through most of the last year so we understand the importance of looking after the ball. \u201cSome sides are about a really solid set-piece, others more about attack. They\u2019ve got a pretty all-round game. Their set-piece game is strong, their transitions are strong, they defend exceptionally well with a lot of intent. Eddie talked about it, they\u2019ve got a proud win record. I don\u2019t there is one area that they are brilliant in but they are pretty good across most of the areas.\u201d",

The NSW Minerals Council chief executive, Stephen Galilee, fronted the Independent Commission Against Corruption (Icac) on Monday to answer questions about the way his organisation attempts to influence government. His evidence came just two days after the NSW government launched a review of the Independent Planning Commission (IPC), a body designed to check ministerial power to grant new mining licences, which was set up following recommendations from Icac. Last month, the IPC rejected the development of the Bylong Valley coalmine near Mudgee because of significant concerns about environmental impacts, including on climate change, and the costs to future generations. Galilee said his organisation has been lobbying hard against the state\u2019s independent planning body, particularly following the Bylong Valley rejection. Galilee said he hoped the decision to review the IPC was a result of the NSW Minerals Council\u2019s campaign, which he said had \u201cbeen highlighting these issues publicly and privately to the government and the minister\u201d without much traction for some time.

The former Icac commissioner David Ipp said it was a \u201crecipe for corruption\u201d. Another former Icac commissioner and Centre for Public Integrity chair, Anthony Whealy, said the IPC was a \u201ca crucial accountability agency\u201d that must be preserved. \u201cIt is now facing a review, announced by the NSW government under pressure from the Minerals Council of NSW,\u201d Whealy said. \u201cThis raises questions about the vested interests of the Minerals Council and the impact that is having on our accountability institutions.\u201d Galilee likened the NSW Minerals Council, which has 14 employees and a turnover of up to $7m, to a small business. He argued against adding to what were already \u201cincredibly onerous\u201d transparency and integrity regulations, unless environmental groups and not-for-profits were subjected to the same. Galilee said such groups had just as much resources and staffing, but their funding sources were opaque, despite them having \u201cunduly influenced\u201d and \u201cgamed\u201d the planning system to thwart the approval of new mines in the state. He rejected a proposition from the Icac chief commissioner, Peter Hall, that groups who were lobbying for vested, commercial interests should face more scrutiny than environmental groups or not-for-profits. \u201cI disagree because you\u2019re putting a price on transparency. You\u2019re saying transparency applies to some and not others,\u201d Galilee said. Galilee estimated he met with ministers roughly eight to 10 times in the past two or three years, and their chiefs of staff about 10 to 15 times. He downplayed the impact the mining industry was having on government and the gains it got from access to ministers. \u201cThere\u2019s very rarely anything resolved from a meeting with a minister other than to have more meetings with a department official to keep on talking about something, and then six years later we get a refusal,\u201d he said. \u201cIf things were going so well for us we wouldn\u2019t be getting project refusals and we wouldn\u2019t be getting increasing regulation, and timeframes for assessment wouldn\u2019t be going up \u2013 and the number of mines in NSW wouldn\u2019t be falling, investment wouldn\u2019t be dropping, and we wouldn\u2019t be running a public campaign against the planning minister and his planning system.\u201d The current Icac inquiry into lobbying in NSW, named Operation Eclipse, is continuing.",

Waste generation in Victoria has increased from 7.4m tonnes per year in 2000 to 13.4m tonnes per year in 2017-18. Since China began strict enforcement limiting the level of contaminated recycling material it would accept, recycling companies in Victoria have struggled to find new places to export recycling.

A loose agglomeration of songs, sometimes linked by brief monologues and get-out-the-vote exhortations, it is both an introduction to Byrne\u2019s particular psychology and catalogue and an oblique consideration of America today and how it might be bettered. Resistance is musical.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/20/david-byrne-my-agent-says-im-having-a-leonard-cohen-moment\">David Byrne: \u2018My agent says I\u2019m having a Leonard Cohen moment\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The show curtain is designed by Maira Kalman. When it disappears, the stage is bare except for Byrne, seated at a table and holding a brain. As he sings Here, the final track on his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/11/david-byrne-american-utopia-review-chipper-equanimity\">recent solo album, also called American Utopia</a>, a back-up singer (Chris Giarmo) enters, then another (Tendayi Kuumba), a bassist (Bobby Wooten III, a pocket sun) follows, a guitarist (Angie Swan, sharkskin cool), percussionists and soon the stage is thronged with bodies, all in gray suits, all barefoot.</p> <p>Mounds of metal rise and become a shimmering curtain while the lyrics explore neural connection: \u201cHere is an area of great confusion/ Here is a section that\u2019s extremely precise/ And here is an area that needs attention/ Here is a connection with the opposite side.\u201d The noise is very joyful.</p> <p>Sometimes Byrne speaks between songs, sometimes he doesn\u2019t, sometimes he takes up a guitar, sometimes he simply sings. There is no director but Alex Timbers, who collaborated with Byrne on the thrilling Here Lies Love and the mortifying Joan of Arc: Into the Fire, is listed as a production consultant.</p> <p>Byrne\u2019s voice has never been particularly flexible, but it remains forceful. His presence has become more avuncular, less alien, like the ringmaster of an extremely well-behaved circus.

      "bodyText": "More than a concert and less than a musical, a one-man show with a full backing band, American Utopia brings David Byrne \u2013 gray-haired, gray-suited, barefoot, magnificent \u2013 to Broadway. A loose agglomeration of songs, sometimes linked by brief monologues and get-out-the-vote exhortations, it is both an introduction to Byrne\u2019s particular psychology and catalogue and an oblique consideration of America today and how it might be bettered. Resistance is musical. The show curtain is designed by Maira Kalman. When it disappears, the stage is bare except for Byrne, seated at a table and holding a brain. As he sings Here, the final track on his recent solo album, also called American Utopia, a back-up singer (Chris Giarmo) enters, then another (Tendayi Kuumba), a bassist (Bobby Wooten III, a pocket sun) follows, a guitarist (Angie Swan, sharkskin cool), percussionists and soon the stage is thronged with bodies, all in gray suits, all barefoot. Mounds of metal rise and become a shimmering curtain while the lyrics explore neural connection: \u201cHere is an area of great confusion/ Here is a section that\u2019s extremely precise/ And here is an area that needs attention/ Here is a connection with the opposite side.\u201d The noise is very joyful. Sometimes Byrne speaks between songs, sometimes he doesn\u2019t, sometimes he takes up a guitar, sometimes he simply sings. There is no director but Alex Timbers, who collaborated with Byrne on the thrilling Here Lies Love and the mortifying Joan of Arc: Into the Fire, is listed as a production consultant. Byrne\u2019s voice has never been particularly flexible, but it remains forceful. His presence has become more avuncular, less alien, like the ringmaster of an extremely well-behaved circus. He and the band perform Annie-B Parson\u2019s angular, energetic choreography, some of it adapted from Byrne\u2019s concert moves. The lighting, by Rob Sinclair, moves from white to red to blue. The songs are fascinated by the furniture of adult life \u2013 a job, a girlfriend, a house, a car \u2013 while standing slightly apart from it. The monologues explore Byrne\u2019s slight alienation from these things \u2013 \u201cMe, I just observe and pay attention and watch,\u201d he says \u2013 moving gradually into more political concerns. There\u2019s no arc to the show, no narrative, though any of the monologues center on the idea of connection. Connection doesn\u2019t come naturally to Byrne, who has discussed his autism. With his gentlemanly remove, it\u2019s not always clear what Byrne wants from the audience (attention, common cause) or what the audience wants from him, besides the hits. A little more than halfway through the evening, Byrne reminds everyone that they have permission to dance as long as the aisles remain clear.
