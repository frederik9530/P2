      "bodyText": "Louis Vuitton, the world\u2019s biggest luxury brand, closed Paris fashion week with a collection steeped in sentimental affection for the city\u2019s belle \u00e9poque era of 1871 to 1914. If fashion channels the mood of the times, it is striking when a house whose exclusive logo-stamped luggage has made it a global byword for aspirational living declares the past a more appealing reference than the future. Especially when the designer is Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re, whose mood boards are usually a blend of science fiction costumes, Japanese anime motifs and landmarks of modernist architecture. The collection was a love letter to a postcard version of Paris: the age of Folies Berg\u00e8re and the Eiffel Tower, curlicued lamps on the banks of the Seine and art nouveau metro signs. Ghesqui\u00e8re said he wanted to explore \u201cdandyism, and those particular snobberies that would later become what is known as French elegance\u201d. The clothes channelled the mood music of Paris at its most charming, rather than being literal in their retro-reference. Ghesqui\u00e8re\u2019s futuristic clothes tend to be what is referred to politely, in fashion-speak, as \u201ccostume-adjacent\u201d, but this collection was extremely wearable and immediately desirable. High-waisted, wide-legged trousers were worn with silk blouses layered under tailored blazers. Belted trench coats and clean-lined shifts were worn with block-heeled loafers or moccasins. Handbags were timelessly elegant \u2013 and even sensibly sized, rather than minuscule \u2013 with graceful top handles. The show took place in a courtyard of the Louvre, where a vast video screen showed Scottish musician Sophie, who chooses not to disclose a gender identity, performing It\u2019s Okay to Cry, a song described in a Guardian review as \u201ca power ballad about an identity-based struggle \u2026 hideous and heartrending, an overacted meditation on self-acceptance that could easily prompt real tears\u201d. In a blockbuster commercial evening, this was the only nod to the alternative aesthetic leanings for which Ghesqui\u00e8re is usually known. Louis Vuitton was valued in May at $39.3bn (\u00a332bn), putting it well ahead of Chanel, its closest competitor \u2013 and it is getting bigger.

Giles, the opposition spokesman on cities and urban infrastructure and a former deputy chair of the joint standing committee on electoral matters, told a seminar at the University of Melbourne that policy agendas meant little to voters in 2019 \u201cif no one believes it could ever be delivered\u201d. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point, fundamentally, of all our campaigning if it\u2019s met with a resigned cynicism at best, or outright rejection at worst,\u201d Giles said. \u201cWe need to think about who\u2019s participating, and how. We need to think about whether all Australians\u2019 concerns are reflected and represented. We need to think about who\u2019s not involved \u2013 whether by choice or by having been excluded.\u201d The challenge was not so much executing a technical review but arriving at an understanding of why people were alienated from the system: \u201cI believe that the challenge is to reinforce and rebuild electoral and political institutions which support trust and confidence in our democracy.\u201d His comments come as the joint standing committee on electoral matters is inquiring into the conduct of the election, and Labor has urged the committee to investigate specifically whether the digital behemoths are having a negative impact on Australian democracy after Facebook refused to take down fake news about the \u201cdeath tax\u201d circulating during the May election campaign. He hoped the committee could make useful suggestions at the end of its inquiry if it was prepared to ask the right questions, and said that during the last parliament it managed \u201cto reach significant agreements on a multi-partisan basis\u201d. But fixing deficiencies in the system required politicians to understand trust and confidence was waning in democracies around the world, including Australia, for a range of reasons. \u201cOur accountability framework simply isn\u2019t what it should be,\u201d he said. \u201cThe very notion of a truly independent public service providing frank and fearless advice to government is under siege. Our freedom of information laws have become something close to a joke. \u201cIn this age of big data, it\u2019s getting harder and harder to obtain information about government decision-making. On a closely related note, the other declining institution we need to think about is the news media.\u201d There had been considerable attention in recent weeks on press freedom, he said. \u201cThreats to press freedom and the public\u2019s right to know are critical, but [are] only part of the problem,\u201d he said. \u201cOur democracy rests on shared understandings \u2013 being able to share in a national conversation. I\u2019m worried that the fragmentation of our traditional media, the pressures on journalists and the practice of journalism, as well as the encroachment of the social media giants, has eroded our capacity to carry on this conversation. \u201cCurated news consumption narrows our understanding of the world, and diminishes our capacity to engage in meaningful debate. Without restoring a genuine national conversation, I fear any other reforms to our electoral or political institutions may prove worthless\u201d. He hoped the committee would look at nuts and bolts, like recommending real-time disclosure of donations with an appropriate disclosure limit of $1,000, and consider expenditure caps. \u201cThe extraordinary role of Clive Palmer in May\u2019s election demands a response,\u201d he said. \u201cA billionaire spending $60m is a powerful reminder that the problem isn\u2019t just about party fundraising and disclosure. It\u2019s about dealing with an understanding that our politics can be purchased.\u201d Giles said the other side of that coin was \u201cthe sense of alienation felt by too many Australians\u201d. \u201cLet\u2019s think about those not enrolled to vote, those who didn\u2019t vote, and those whose ballots reflected frustration not inspiration,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s not lose sight of the main game here: restoring confidence in the possibilities of Australian politics [and] developing and committing to an institutional framework that we can all have faith in.\u201d",

An alternative idea involves only Northern Ireland staying in the EU\u2019s customs territory. That would place a customs border in the Irish Sea. May described it as a threat to the constitutional integrity of the UK, but the new prime minister, Boris Johnson, has opened the current talks by proposing an all-Ireland agri-food zone. The suggestion is that he will seek to quietly build on that with further NI-only arrangements.</p>\n    <p>Given an NI-only backstop was an EU proposal in the first place, the U-turn would be warmly welcomed in Brussels, although attempts to give the Northern Ireland assembly a veto on its continuation would not be acceptable, and the DUP would be unlikely to support the prime minister in such a move in parliament.</p>\n    <p>If there is a no-deal Brexit, then there is no backstop.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/daniel-boffey\"><b>Daniel Boffey</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Speaking to the media on Tuesday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/01/boris-johnson-dismisses-leaked-irish-border-plans-as-not-quite-right\">Johnson denied reports</a> that his first formal proposals to the EU would involve customs clearance sites five to 10 miles from the border to the north and the south to deal with imports and exports.</p> \n<p>The prime minister reiterated, however, that Northern Ireland could not be left in the EU\u2019s customs territory after Brexit and said it was simply a \u201creality\u201d that there would need to be extra checks and controls on the island of Ireland.</p> \n<p>Speaking in the Irish parliament, the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, welcomed the fact that Johnson had \u201cdisowned\u201d the reported contents of the \u201cnon-papers\u201d discussion documents submitted by the UK to the European commission but fired a shot across the prime minister\u2019s bows.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m conscious when answering your question that I am talking about non-papers that I haven\u2019t seen,\u201d Varadkar told the Irish parliament.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson\u2019s hopes of entering into intensive and decisive Brexit negotiations next week could be dashed after he was sharply criticised in Dublin, Paris and Berlin for signalling plans for the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland. The prime minister is expected to set out his long-awaited proposals for the Irish border in his speech at Conservative party conference in Manchester on Wednesday, outlining what he will call \u201ca fair and reasonable compromise\u201d but warning that if the EU27 does not engage, he will press ahead with no deal. Johnson confirmed on Tuesday that his plans would include a customs border on the island of Ireland but insisted the proposals would show that the new regime of checks and controls would be light-touch. The plan would also involve Northern Ireland staying under EU single market regulations for agrifood and manufactured goods for four years, leaving it in a special relationship with the bloc until at least 2025. Stormont will at that point decide whether to continue alignment with EU standards on manufactured goods or follow UK rules as the country diverges. But the plans in which Northern Ireland would have two borders for a four-year period are set to receive a frosty welcome when they are formally published on Wednesday. If the UK had accepted the need for Northern Ireland to temporarily stay under both single market regulations and in a shared customs territory with the EU after Brexit, sources in Brussels disclosed to the Guardian that pressure might have been applied on Dublin to accept a time limit, an unthinkable concession just six months ago, and one yet to be discussed among the EU27. But officials and diplomats said the current \u201ckamikaze\u201d approach taken by Downing Street to the customs border offered no way forward and Johnson\u2019s hopes of finding an agreement would be swiftly dashed. \u201cI expect Mr Barnier [the EU chief negotiator] will make it clear very quickly that this does not stack up,\u201d said one EU diplomat. With little over two weeks before the crunch EU leaders\u2019 summit at which Johnson hopes to sign off on a deal, Downing Street is banking on then entering secretive \u201ctunnel\u201d negotiations to hammer out the details of an agreement. Johnson\u2019s predecessor at No 10, Theresa May, had secured an all-UK customs element to the backstop following such a period of talks in 2018, during which the European commission\u2019s negotiators took risks over the unity of the EU27 in order to find a deal that could be put to parliament.

Ah, I can\u2019t believe that I came so close. This was such a good opportunity. I\u2019ve been running so well through the heats. My body feels good and I just let it go when I had it and I\u2019m so sorry.</p> <p>People always say \u2018don\u2019t apologise\u2019 but I just feel like I have let so many people down. There\u2019s so many people that have believed in me and sent me such nice messages over the past few days. The team that I\u2019ve worked with have done so well. The last few years, I\u2019ve been plagued by injuries and my performances have shown it. And I\u2019ve got back to where I should be and to not be able to break 20 seconds is so disappointing and heartbreaking. I had the medal and it slipped out of my hands.</p> <p>I have to take the positives, I guess, from being written off pretty much, labeled a \u2018relay runner\u2019 or whatever. It just shows that you just need that tight-knit group of people around you and you can achieve whatever you wanna achieve. For me, that hasn\u2019t happened today but it has relit something inside of me. Tokyo next year, it\u2019s winnable.</p> <p>I\u2019ll have to go away and reset. I have a couple of days until the heats. I\u2019m fit and healthy. Hopefully I\u2019ll be in the team and there will be a bit of redemption just like 2017.

Welcome to day 5 of the athletics world championships in Doha, where we will have four finals this evening.</strong> We begin with the men\u2019s pole vault final, and Sam Kendricks of the United States will look to dominate the field after his monstrous best of 6.06 this year. In the women\u2019s javelin final, China\u2019s Lyu Huihui has won her last 12 competitions and will be looking for one more.</p> <p>On the track, the women will only be contesting semi-finals. Shaunae Miller-Uibo of The Bahamas is the heavy favourite to win the women\u2019s 400 metres but Bahrain\u2019s Salwa Eid Naser will be hoping to make a statement as they prepare for a final showdown. Of course, the women\u2019s 200 metres semi-finals will include the woman of the moment Dina Asher-Smith. In a field that is slightly weaker than expected, there is no doubt that she is the gold medal favourite.</p> <p>Day 5 will conclude with two men\u2019s finals on the tracks. In the 800 metres, Donavan Brazier of the United States will be the man to beat. And then we will conclude with the men\u2019s 200 metres final. With a world lead of 19.50 seconds, Noah Lyles of the United States has been miles ahead of the field this year. Andre De Grasse, Ramil Guliyev and co. will be looking to rein him in. Can Adam Gemili spring a surprise and land an unexpected first individual world medal?

      "bodyText": "Seriously, what another dramatic day in Doha. A brilliant pole vault final, a last gasp winning throw in the women\u2019s javelin, a championship record from Donavan Brazier and then an edgy Noah Lyles had to battle from behind to win his 200 metres title. The more the latter final is replayed, the more it seems like Gemili\u2019s early lead may have just spooked Lyles a little and he had to react. Nobody saw that coming. Gemili couldn\u2019t hang on for his first global medal, but we should all bookmark this moment and prepare to look back after Tokyo 2020 or Oregon in 2021. This could be a defining moment for Gemili after years of injuries. That\u2019s all from me today. Until tomorrow. Here is Sean Ingle\u2019s report from another lively day in Doha. Here is a sobering read from Sean Ingle on Alberto Salazar\u2019s four year ban and the fallout for UK Athletics and Mo Farah. Michael Johnson on the BBC thought that Gemili did a far better job than he gave himself credit for: I don\u2019t think his perspective right now is really clear on the race and what he would have had to do to get among the medals. I think that he felt like, \u2018Well, I\u2019m in really good shape, I\u2019m finally healthy and I\u2019m starting to come back so that means that I feel like I should get a medal because I did everything I needed to do and I\u2019m healthy and I\u2019m back.\u2019 But, at the end of the day, when you look at the times, he ran 20.03. He matched his season best. His personal best is 19.97. So, for him to say, \u2018I didn\u2019t even get under 20 seconds?\u2019 Well, he\u2019s only been slightly under 20 seconds before so he would have had to run a personal best. Quinonez won in 19.98, his personal best is 19.97. I think that when he goes back and looks at this, he\u2019ll think: \u2018I was really close.\u2019 Those guys just ran really really well in comparison to him, his personal best and his capabilities, and he\u2019ll see in that race that his form didn\u2019t really fall apart at the end. A heartbroken Adam Gemili was close to tears in his BBC interview: I\u2019m just gutted. I just had it. I had it. I gave it everything. I lost all my bounce at the end. I had nothing left. All my form went out the window and I ran like such an amateur. Ah, I can\u2019t believe that I came so close. This was such a good opportunity. I\u2019ve been running so well through the heats. My body feels good and I just let it go when I had it and I\u2019m so sorry. People always say \u2018don\u2019t apologise\u2019 but I just feel like I have let so many people down. There\u2019s so many people that have believed in me and sent me such nice messages over the past few days. The team that I\u2019ve worked with have done so well. The last few years, I\u2019ve been plagued by injuries and my performances have shown it. And I\u2019ve got back to where I should be and to not be able to break 20 seconds is so disappointing and heartbreaking. I had the medal and it slipped out of my hands. I have to take the positives, I guess, from being written off pretty much, labeled a \u2018relay runner\u2019 or whatever. It just shows that you just need that tight-knit group of people around you and you can achieve whatever you wanna achieve. For me, that hasn\u2019t happened today but it has relit something inside of me. Tokyo next year, it\u2019s winnable. I\u2019ll have to go away and reset. I have a couple of days until the heats. I\u2019m fit and healthy. Hopefully I\u2019ll be in the team and there will be a bit of redemption just like 2017. This is such a bad interview because I\u2019m just gutted. That was tough. Gemili flitted out of the blocks and was actually leading until about 120 metres. For once, Lyles did not look as comfortable as in previous races, but he remained calm and pulled through into the lead. With a medal in his sights, Gemili\u2019s form began to fall apart in the final 40 metres and he watched as both De Grasse and Quinonez pass him. That was definitely not what anyone was expecting. De Grasse takes silver in 19.95, Quinonez 19.98. Gemili, who was in second for much of the race, pipped at the end. He takes 4th. It\u2019s time for the men\u2019s 200 metres final. Noah Lyles of the United States has run far faster than the rest of the world today with a world leading time of 19.50. We\u2019ll see if the likes of Andre De Grasse and Ramil Guliyev can stay with him, and if Adam Gemili can secure a surprising medal. But first, it\u2019s time for the lights show... In the women\u2019s javelin, Kelsey-Lee Barber of Australia snatches a stunning gold medal with a winning throw of 66.56 on her final attempt. Shiying Liu and Huihui Lyu of China settle for silver and bronze. Lyu had won 12 successive meets coming into Doha, but you have to perform when it truly matters. Sam Kendricks wins the pole vault world title. 19 year-old Armand Duplantis fails to clear 5.97, handing Kendricks the win with one fewer foul. As the pair hug and then exhaustedly collapse onto the mat, bronze medalist Piotr Lisek joins them before they all backflip in unison. Lovely stuff. Donavan Brazier destroys the field to win in 1:42.34 with a championship record and a national record. That was a tough, tough race, with Wesley Vazquez taking the lead and trying to win the race from the front. But as the Puerto Rican tied up, Brazier roared through the final 200 metres. Amel Tuka takes second place in 1:43.47, over a second slower. Ferguson Cheruiyot Rotich takes third. It\u2019s time for the men\u2019s 800m final. Donavan Brazier of the United States starts as favourite and Kenya\u2019s Ferguson Cheruiyot Rotich as the world leader. However, this is a pretty open race. Sam Kendricks clears 5.97 at the final attempt! His teammate Cole Walsh sprints back onto the runway to hug and yell at the world leader some more. If his cheerleading continues, Walsh may just deserve a fraction of Kendrick\u2019s winnings for his help. Breathtaking scenes in the men\u2019s pole vault as Duplantis clears 5.97 at the final try. He just brushed the bar on his way down. It shook, but it stays. Huge. This child is 19 years old. The favourite Sam Kendricks is down to his final jump. That was easy and brilliant from Dina Asher-Smith. She absolute destroyed the field from the beginning, tearing around the bend to establish her lead in the first 100m and then relaxing to the end. Her time of 22.16 was .30 faster than the rest of the field and it looks like there is much more to come. Then she even helped Anthonique Strachan, who seems to have badly hurt her knee, off the track. Dina Asher-Smith eases into the final, winning her semi-final in 22.16. It\u2019s time for Dina Asher-Smith. The 100 metres silver medalist is on the track for the third 200 metres semi-final. There aren\u2019t many threats in her race. She just has to keep her head. Back in the, men\u2019s pole vault final, the drama continues. Sam Kendricks of the United States turns the tables on his foes by immediately clearing 5.92. Duplantis of Sweden fouls twice, Poland\u2019s Lisek fouls once and then passes for the next height. On his final attempt at 5.92, 19 year-old Duplantis clears. Phew. In the second women\u2019s 200m semi-final, USA\u2019s Brittany Brown takes the win in 22.46. Tyina Gaither of the Bahamas snatches the second automatic spot in 22.57. Meanwhile in the men\u2019s pole vault, Sam Kendricks barely survived 5.87m, clearing it at the final attempt. His countryman Cole Walsh, who departed at 5.70, began screaming at him in excitement. Kendricks cracks a smile, and perhaps he just relaxed. Onto 5.92. Anglerne Annelus wins the first 200 metres semi-final with a time of 22.49. Not exactly a stunning time, but it\u2019s enough. A good run from Mujinga Kambundji of Switzerland too, who missed the 100m final by a thousandth of a second. The women\u2019s 200 metres sprinters are on the tracks. Britain\u2019s Jodie Williams has had a great year and she is in with a chance of making a global final. Let\u2019s see what she looks like under world championships pressure. Elaine Thompson has withdrawn from the women\u2019s 200m semi-finals. Thompson has been struggling with her achilles and hasn\u2019t been able to give her best at this event. More opportunities for the rest of the field... Some drama in the men\u2019s pole vault at last. After clean cards for all three of them, Duplantis, Lisek and favourite Kendricks all fail to clear their first attempts at 5.80. 19 year-old Duplantis of Sweden clears at his second attempt. The pressure is now firmly on the other two. We have our three men\u2019s pole vault medalists, and all three haven\u2019t missed a single jump yet. Now, let\u2019s see who wins. Well, that was dramatic. Stephenie Ann Mcpherson wins the third semi-final in 50.70. Both Shakima Wimbley and Galefele Moroko failed to finish the race, with the latter taken off the track in a wheelchair. Sprinting for 400 metres is tough! A solid run from Britain\u2019s Emily Diamond, who recorded a 51.62 season best. There is some more British interest in the final women\u2019s 400 metres semi-final. Emily Diamond will be running from lane two. Tough ask for her to make the final, but you never know... Shaunae Miller-Uibo stamps her mark on the competition with an easy 49.66 to win the second 400 metres semi-final. Jamaica\u2019s Shericka Jackson streamed through the opening 300 metres, but the favourite ran her own race and breezed past in the final 100m. Jackson was also passed by the talented young American Wadeline Jonathas on the line, who secured a personal best of 50.07 after starting the year having run no faster than 52.8. In the women\u2019s 400m semi-finals, Salwa Eid Naser makes a very clear statement by tearing through the field in 49.79 seconds. Only one other sprinter, defending champion Phyllis Francis (50.22), finished under 51 seconds. A tough, tough race for Britain\u2019s Laviai Nielsen, who finished last in 52.94. The pole vaulters are now up to 5.70. Sam Kendricks just flew high over the bar, a terrifying sight for his rivals. Thiago Braz also seems to have recovered from his first round mishap. But 15 centimetres is a big progression and only six men passed at the first opportunity. We begin with the men\u2019s pole vault final. Sam Kendricks is the favourite and the vaulters are starting at 5.55m. That is fairly low by their extremely high standards, but not for Olympic champion Thiago Braz who fails at the first jump. That may prove costly. Please do also check out Sean Ingle\u2019s complete report from last night. Terrifying. Of course, the big news today comes off the track. Alberto Salazar, former coach of Mo Farah who oversaw Sifan Hassan\u2019s 10,000m win earlier this week, has been banned for four years for doping offences. Hello! Welcome to day 5 of the athletics world championships in Doha, where we will have four finals this evening. We begin with the men\u2019s pole vault final, and Sam Kendricks of the United States will look to dominate the field after his monstrous best of 6.06 this year. In the women\u2019s javelin final, China\u2019s Lyu Huihui has won her last 12 competitions and will be looking for one more. On the track, the women will only be contesting semi-finals. Shaunae Miller-Uibo of The Bahamas is the heavy favourite to win the women\u2019s 400 metres but Bahrain\u2019s Salwa Eid Naser will be hoping to make a statement as they prepare for a final showdown. Of course, the women\u2019s 200 metres semi-finals will include the woman of the moment Dina Asher-Smith. In a field that is slightly weaker than expected, there is no doubt that she is the gold medal favourite. Day 5 will conclude with two men\u2019s finals on the tracks. In the 800 metres, Donavan Brazier of the United States will be the man to beat. And then we will conclude with the men\u2019s 200 metres final. With a world lead of 19.50 seconds, Noah Lyles of the United States has been miles ahead of the field this year. Andre De Grasse, Ramil Guliyev and co. will be looking to rein him in. Can Adam Gemili spring a surprise and land an unexpected first individual world medal? Time will tell.

      "bodyText": "A federal judge ruled that Harvard University\u2019s undergraduate admissions program is constitutional, rejecting a challenge accusing the school of discrimination against Asian American applicants. In a decision released on Tuesday, US district judge Allison Burroughs in Boston said that while Harvard\u2019s admissions program is not perfect, \u201cthe court will not dismantle a very fine admissions program that passes constitutional muster, solely because it could do better\u201d. The case had pitted the Ivy League school against Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA), which opposes affirmative action policies, and whose case was backed by the Trump administration. Supporters of the lawsuit said Harvard illegally discriminated against Asian Americans by putting a cap on the number admitted to the university, making it harder for Asian applicants to get in. Its opponents charged that the case was not about Asian Americans at Harvard; rather, they said it was an issue that has been co-opted by conservative activists whose real goal is ending race-conscious admissions policies that give minority students a better shot at attending universities like Harvard. Supporters on both sides charged the other with racism. Legal experts have said SFFA is likely to appeal, and the case is expected to eventually make its way up to the US supreme court, which would give its five-member conservative majority a chance to bar or more strictly limit the use of affirmative action to help minority applicants get into college. Burroughs ruled nearly a year after holding a non-jury trial. The SFFA group that brought the case accused Harvard of going too far by engaging in \u201cracial balancing\u201d that limited Asian Americans to no more than 20% of its incoming classes. The group, founded by a longtime affirmative action opponent, Edward Blum, argued that while Asian Americans outperformed other groups on academic measures, stereotyping caused them to receive low scores on subjective \u201cpersonal\u201d ratings. Harvard denied that charge, saying that its use of race in admissions was legal, and was not a factor in the \u201cpersonal\u201d ratings. The US Department of Justice sided with SFFA, saying Harvard had not seriously considered race-neutral approaches to admissions. It has also investigated whether another Ivy League school, Yale University, also discriminates against Asian Americans.",

      "bodyText": "Pep Guardiola speaks: On his substitutions: \u201cGames need everybody, the starting eleven and the people who came from the bench,\u201d he says in an interview with BT Sport. On those missed chances in the first half: \u201cThese kind of games are hard because they defend aggressively, one against one,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s always tricky. In the first half we had three or four chances but it was 0-0. We were patient. We scored a good goal in the second half but it was difficult. They were so strong - with 10 players in the box, waiting for a free-kick or a counter-attack from [Bruno] Petkovic.\u201d On Phil Foden\u2019s brief goal-scoring cameo: \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for Phil Foden because he deserves to play more minutes,\u201d he says. \u201cBut he\u2019s going to earn his chance.\u201d He refuses to discuss the yellow card he was shown and can\u2019t get away quick enough when the interviewer thanks him for his time. Jamie Jackson was at the Etihad Stadium to see Raheem Sterling and Phil Foden come off the bench to score the goals that did for Dinao Zagreb. while he goes off to hurl interrogatory projectiles at Pep Guardiola, you can read his piping hot take on the final whistle. City go top of the group: City make it two wins from two in Group C, seeing off Dinamo Zagreb with the help of goals from the substitutes Raheem Sterling and Phil Foden. They should have won a game they dominated throughout far more easily, but were guilty of missing a glut of good scoring opportunities in the first half. Hats off to Dinamo Zagreb, who rode their luck at times, but mounted a very impressive rearguard action. Class prevailed in the end, however. Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeep! It\u2019s all over at the Etihad, where Manchester City have beaten Dinamo Zagreb by two goals to no score. Moments before blowing the final whistle, referee Serdar Gozubuyuk brandished his yellow card in the face of Zagreb manager Nenad Bjelica, who was unhappy about something or other. Foden scores! City score from a counter-attack, picking up a pass from Raheem Sterling just inside the Dinamo Zagreb penalty area and rifling a low drive into the bottom left-hand corner. He wheels away in celebration, kissing the crest of his shirt. 90+3 min: Dinamo Zagreb keep plugging away desperate to rescue a point at the end of a game in which they\u2019ve defended stoutly throughout but ridden their luck at times. It took the intervention of Raheem Sterling, who came off the bench shortly before the hour mark to put City ahead in a match they have totally dominated. 90+2 min: Now Dinamo manager Nenad Bjelica is having a very animated discussion with the fourth official. He avoids a yellow card. 90+2 min: Foden gets a touch of the ball, dispossessing Marin Leovac. 90+1 min: Manchester City substitution: Phil Foden on for David Silva. 90 min: Manchester City corner. Next. 88 min: Manchester City substitution: Gabriel Jesus comes on for Sergio Aguero, who looks a bit fed up. He has a word with the referee on his way off, presumably enquiring why he didn\u2019t get a penalty a few minutes ago. 86 min: Sterling holds the ball up in the Dinamo Zagreb penalty area, before playing a pass to the onrushing Mahrez. He tries to sweep it past Livakovic, but the goalkeeper makes another good save. No penalty! The ref elects not to check his sideline monitor and Dinamo Zagreb get away with one there. Stojanovic\u2019s shove on Gundogan was arguably six of one and half a dozen of another, but Peric definitely tripped Aguero. I have no dog in this fight, but that should definitely have been overturned on the grounds of being a clear and obvious error. As we have seen so often in the Premier League, it obviously wasn\u2019t clear and obvious enough for the video assistant referee\u2019s liking. 82 min: Gundogan goes to ground under a shove from Stojanovic, then moments later Aguero goes down after being tripped by Dino Peric. The referee takes time out to consult with his video assistants. 81 min: Gundogan blazes high over the bar when he should have hit the target after running on to a pass from Mahrez. 79 min: In the classic City style, David Silva tries to pick out Sergio Aguero on the edge of the six-yard box with a pull-back from the byline. They\u2019ve scored tons of goals in similar fashion, but this time a defender dives in to intervene. 78 min: Dinamo Zagreb substitution: Mario Gavranovic on for Kevin Theophile-Catherine. City win another corner, from which nothing comes. 75 min: Now Aguero goes down on the edge of the Dinamo Zagreb penalty area, under a challenge from Dilaver. He doesn\u2019t get a free-kick and Pep reacts furiously on the touchline. It\u2019s getting very scrappy \u2013 in every sense of the word \u2013 at the Etihad. 74 min: Rodri appears to trip Dani Olmo on the edge of the Manchester City penalty area, then gets the hump with the referee for not giving him a free-kick. 72 min: On the touchline, Pep Guardiola shakes his head at the injustice of it all after being shown a yellow card by referee Serdar Gozubuyuk. I can only speculate, but I guess he was voicing his extreme displeasure at the referee\u2019s decision not to award Raheem Sterling the aforementioned penalty or free-kick. He was having a right go at the fourth official, whatever bee was buzzing around his bonnet. 70 min: Raheem Sterling, who has been outstanding since he came on, goes down just outside the left side of the Dinamo Zagreb penalty area under a challenge from Stojanovic. He thinks he should have had a free-kick or penalty, but the ref is not having it. 69 min: Dino Peric is booked for a decidedly agricultural tackle on Riyad Mahrez that leaves the City man wincing with pain once he gets to his feet. 67 min: Relief for City, who finally go ahead. Rodri squared the ball from the left flank and under pressure from a defender on the edge of the six-yard box, Sterling does well to stay on his feet and prod the ball past Livakovic. Raheem Sterling pokes the ball home from six yards out to give Man City a lead that\u2019s been a long time coming. 65 min: Peric slides in to put the ball over his own cross-bar with more last-ditch defending. 64 min: Stojanovic tracks a Sterling run and prevents the City substitute from receiving a pass on the left side of the Dinamo Zagreb penalty area. Good defending - he\u2019s been very impressive this evening, as have most of the visiting defenders. 63 min: Great work from Fernandinho, who wins the ball in the middle third and plays it wide to Sterling. He\u2019s unable to fashion a yard for a shot. 62 min: Dinamo Zagreb substitution: Amer Gojak replaces Mislav Orsic up front. 60 min: We hit the hour mark and it remains goalless. Cancelo tries to pull the ball across the Zagreb penalty area from the byline, but fails to beat the first man. Emir Dilaver intercepts and clears. 58 min: Sterling goes down hurt after a collision with Emir Dilaver as he tried to steer a low Mendy cross goalwards. He got a toe to the ball, despite the defender\u2019s good challenge, but was unable to get too much power on his effort. He\u2019s fit to continue. 57 min: Sterling immediately has an impact, forcing Stojanovic to put the ball out for a corner as he attempts to get on the end of a cross. Nothing comes from the set-piece. 56 min: Manchester City substitution: Raheem Sterling on, Bernardo Silva off. 55 min: Another cross into the Dinamo Zagreb penalty area, this time from Joao Cancelo. Kevin Theophile-Catherine heads clear. 54 min: Raheem Sterling prepared to enter the fray, while his manager tries to gee up his troops from the technical area. He\u2019s looking very animated. 53 min: Stojanovic puts the ball out for a corner after Mendy sends a low cross into the centre. From the ensuing set-piece, the ball is sent high towards the far post. Livakovic punches clear. 51 min: Joao Cancelo gets the better of Marin Leovac on the right side of the Dinamo Zagreb penalty area, twisting his blood before sitting him on his backside. He gets a cross in, but it\u2019s cleared. 49 min: Some panicked defending from Dinamo Zagreb after a mix-up between Dino Peric and his goalkeeper Dominik Livakovic. They get away with it and eventually hack the ball clear. 47 min: Dinamo Zagreb enjoy a rare sortie into Manchester City territory on the counter and find themselves with a three-on-two. Bruno Petkovic dithers excessively on the ball and fails in his attempt to thread the ball towards Mislav Orsic on his left. City clear their lines. 46 min: Manchester City kick-off, with no changes in personnel on either side. They immediately go on the attack again, trying to pass their way through the Dinamo Zagreb defence. It\u2019s all square: Bernardo Silva, David Silva, Sergio Aguero and Riyad Mahrez have missed seven or eight great chances between them as Manchester City dominated the first half at the Etihad. It remains scoreless. 45+2 min: Not for the first, second or third time tonight, Benjamin Mendy fails to beat the first man as he tries to get a cross in from the left. Manchester city are sending everything through him and he\u2019s not really delivering. 45+1 min: We\u2019re into the first of three added minutes. If Zagreb go in for the break without having conceded a goal, they won\u2019t believe their luck. Having said that, City\u2019s chances have dried up in the past 15 minutes, after they missed six or seven great scoring opportunities in the opening half-hour. 45 min: Joao Cancelo turns on the after-burners to take the ball between two defenders in the inside right channel and square the ball. It\u2019s hacked clear by a Dinamo Zagreb defender. 42 min: David Silva appeals for a penalty after taking a tumble in the Dinamo Zagreb penalty area as he ran on to a through ball from Gundogan. Right wing-back Petar Stojanovic had an arm on his shoulder, but didn\u2019t seem to impede his progress - methinks Silva simply lost his balance. Not every fall from a non-foul has to be a dive, you know? 41 min: Mahrez plays the ball out to Mendy on the left touchline. The left-back is being kept busy tonight, tasked as he is with sending one cross after another into the Dinamo Zagreb penalty area. 38 min: Benjamin Mendy sends another cross into the Dinamo Zagreb penalty area, where Riyad Mahrez is penalised for a sly shove on a defender that was spotted by the referee. 37 min: Free-kick for dinamo Zagreb, wide on the right. Marin Leovic curls the ball into the penalty area, where Ederson catches comfortably. 35 min: Kevin Theophile-Catherine, formerly of Cardiff City, dives in to block a low, hard shot-cross from Bernardo Silva on the edge of the six-yard box. He needn\u2019t have bothered - the linesman\u2019s flag was up. 33 min: I\u2019m not quite sure how, but Dinamo have made it past the half-hour mark without conceding. They\u2019re 1,500 travelling fans will be delighted with that, although their team has been exceptionally lucky. With better finishing, Manchester City could be four or five up at this stage. 31 min: Nicolas Otamendi tries to pick out Benjamin Mendy with a ball between defenders down the inside left. It\u2019s intercepted by Petar Stojanovic. 30 min: Mislav Orsic, wearing No99 for Dinamo Zagreb, attempts to ping a pass down the left touchline for Bruno Petkovic to chase. It\u2019s intercepted. 28 min: Another attack by City, with David Silva picking out Sergio Aguero with a wonderfully weighted pass towards the byline. He attempts to drive it across the face of goal, but Livakovic blocks his delivery at his near post. The goalkeeper punches the ball down the pitch from the ensuing corner. 25 min: Bernardo Silva gets the ball in the net for City, but it\u2019s correctly disallowed due to a hand-ball by Sergio Aguero in the build-up. 23 min: Now it\u2019s David Silva\u2019s turn to miss a decent chance. Mendy sends a cross into the penalty area, where Dinamo Zagreb defender Emir Dilaver handles the ball into the path of Silva. He fires wide from seven yards. Referee Serdar Gozbuyuk puts his hand to his ear to receive guidance from his VAR official, but Manchester City don\u2019t get the penalty they perhaps deserved. I say perhaps, because I don\u2019t really understand the hand-ball (Champions League v Premier League versions) rule any more. 22 min: David Silva pulls a cross ino the penalty area. Riyad Mahrez dummies and leaves it to roll into the path of Ilkay Gundogan, who shoots over the bar when he should at least have hit the target. The collective Manchester City cross-hairs don\u2019t seem to be aligned tonight. 20 min: As Olmo gets patched up on the sideline, Mislav Orsic takes the free-kick from wide on the left. He sends a cross fizzing towards the near post, where Ilkay Gundogan heads the ball out for a corner. Nothing comes of it. 19 min: Joao Cancelo gets booked after catching Dani Olmo with a high boot that leaves Dinamo Zagreb\u2019s star player with a nasty cut over his eye. 18 min: Another chance goes begging, as Aguero gets in front of Dino Peric in the Dinamo Zagreb penalty area to receive a pass from Mendy. Having stolen a yard on his marker, he fires high over the bar. 16 min: Having fired over from the follow-up from that Aguero chance, Bernardo Silva once again blazes over the bar with a volley after more good work by City. They\u2019re very much in charge of this game - Zagreb are struggling to get out of their own half. 13 min: Good save from Livakovic, who gets down to safe at the feet of Aguero after the City striker was put clean through on goal. He was helped by a poor first touch from the Argentinian, which made his task slightly easier. It was a good save nonetheless. 12 min: David Silva plays the ball wide to Mendy on the left touchline. He whips it into the mixer, where David Silva is unable to get the ball out from under his feet and fire off a shot. Zagreb clear. 11 min: Rodri overhits a long pass to Sergio Aguero and the ball runs safely into the arms of Livakovic. 10 min: Manchester City build slowly from the back, before David Silva plays the ball wide to Cancelo on the right touchline. His cross his cleared. 9 min: Dinamo Zagreb midfielder Nikolo Moro goes down holding his shin after being caught by a late challenge from Benjamin Mendy. He\u2019ll live. 7 min: Manchester City are dominating in these early stages, as you might expect. Sergio Aguero and Bernardo Silva have a bit of a mix-up, as the former overhits a pass out wide to the latter and watches the ball go wide. Goal-kick for Zagreb, which goalkeeper Dominik Livakovic takes. 5 min: Rodri passes the most perfunctory of on-pitch head injury assessments and is passed fit to continue, despite looking a bit groggy. It\u2019s not ideal, but at some point we can only hope that football will at least start pretending to take potential concussions seriously. 3 min: There\u2019s a break in play as Rodri takes a heavy fall and requires medical attention. He leaped to contest a high ball and landed awkwardly after colliding with Ilkay Gundogan while airborne. 2 min: Dinamo Zagreb are playing with a back five: three central defenders and two wing-backs in Marin Leovac and Petar Stojanovic. 1 min: Mislav Orsic gets the ball rolling for Dinamo Zagreb, whose players are wearing highlighter pen-coloured fluorescent yellow shirts, shorts and socks. Manchester City\u2019s players wear their usual home kit of light blue shirts, white shorts and white socks. Not long now: Dutch referee Serder Gozubuyuk leads the teams and they line either side of him and his team of match officials for the Champions League. Somewhat predictably, it is booed by the home crowd, who aren\u2019t big fans of Uefa. Elsewhere in Group C: Shakhtar Donetsk have just scored a late, late winner in the fifth minute of added time in their match against Atalanta at the Stadio Atleti Azzurri d\u2019Italia. They\u2019ve won by the odd goal of three. Man City: Ederson, Joao Cancelo, Otamendi, Fernandinho, Mendy, Gundogan, Rodri, Silva, Bernardo Silva, Aguero, Mahrez. Subs: Bravo, Walker, Sterling, Gabriel Jesus, Jose Angelino, Foden, Garcia. Dinamo Zagreb: Livakovic, Stojanovic, Theophile-Catherine, Dilaver, Peric, Leovac, Moro, Arijan Ademi, Olmo, Orsic, Petkovic. Subs: Zagorac, Ivo Pinto, Gavranovic, Gojak, Situm, Atiemwen, Kadzior. Referee: Serdar Gozubuyuk (Netherlands) More from Pep: While talking to the press yesterday, City\u2019s manager acknowledged that fans would prefer to see their team win a third consecutive league title over a maiden victory in the Champions League, but said it was up to him and his players to \u201cseduce\u201d them as far as European competition is concerned. Read on ... Pep Guardiola speaks: During his press conference last night, the Manchester City manager was extolling the virtues of former Barcelona youth player Dani Olmo, who left La Masia a little over five years ago at the age of 16 to join Dinamo Zagreb. \u201cHe was in the Barcelona academy in the past and normally the players there are always good players,\u201d he said. \u201cHe had the courage to go to Croatia and it looks perfect, he was one of the best players at the Under-21 Euros with an incredible work ethic.\u201d You can read more about Olmo\u2019s move in this feature by Aleksandar Holiga. Nenad Bjelica speaks: \u201cEveryone is in optimal condition and everyone will be able to play,\u201d said Dinamo Zagreb\u2019s coach in his pre-match press conference last night. \u201cYou give a lot of importance to tactics and systems, and most importantly, a big heart. We have analysed them and will try to surprise them. Let\u2019s go play a good game, do our best and try to win. Let\u2019s enjoy the game. We want to win. We showed that against Atalanta and so we will try in every game.\u201d Early team news Dinamo Zagreb will be delighted to hear that Kevin De Bruyne has been ruled out of tonight\u2019s game with a groin injury. Riyad Mahrez is likely to start in his place after his excellent performance against Everton over the weekend. . In the absence of Aymeric Laporte and John Stones, Fernadinho is likely to continue playing alongside Nicolas Otamendi in the heart of City\u2019s defence. For Dinamo Zagreb, defenders Kevin Theophile-Catherine and Emir Dilaver were both minor injury doubts, but are expected to be fit for selection. The Etihad Stadium is the venue for tonight\u2019s match between Manchester City and Dinamo Zagreb. The Croatian champions had to come through three rounds of qualifying to make this season\u2019s group stages, seeing off Georgian side Saburtalo, Hungarian outfit Ferencvaros and Norwegian champions Rosenborg along the way. In their opening group game they thrashed Serie A side Atalanta, scoring four without reply, but are likely to face a sterner test on a damp night in Manchester. Kick-off is at 8pm (BST) but stay tuned in the meantime for team news and build-up.",

I think we played 30 minuted really really well, really compact and aggressive. Unlucky that we conceded at the end of the first half for 2-1, and of cure after that they were very clinical.

      "bodyText": "Read Jamie Jackson on Manchester City\u2019s win over Dinamo Zagreb Our Champions League round-up, right here: And that will do! Wow, what an odd night. Thanks for joining me for it, and see you again soon! POCHETTINO SPEAKS! \u201cI don\u2019t need too much time to explain. I think we played 30 minuted really really well, really compact and aggressive. Unlucky that we conceded at the end of the first half for 2-1, and of cure after that they were very clinical. I think there\u2019s not very much difference on the attempts but they were very clinical. We scored a penalty and had some chances to score a third but of course we conceded three more goals and it\u2019s a tough, tough result. I think it\u2019s too much and hard to accept this kind of result but that happens when your opponent has so much quality and is so clinical in front of goal. We are very disappointed and upset but need to stay all together. \u201cIn this type of situation you need to face it. You need to be strong and keep going. We need to stay all together. The best medicine is to be all together, help each other, not find people guilty. Of course when you receive this type of result it\u2019s important to bounce back and believe in yourselves. That is the only way to recover the good feeling.\u201d Fairly light stuff there, really. Wonder if he\u2019s really feeling that philosophical ... You\u2019ll want to get your hands on this \u2013 David Hytner\u2019s report from an extraordinary night: If you\u2019re wondering where any post-match reaction from Pochettino is, we are told that Spurs are \u201cin a meeting\u201d. \u201cLiverpool bounced back from losing a final by winning the whole shebang. Obviously, this is one isolated group match, but it\u2019s hard to see Spurs following that lead,\u201d observes Matt Dony. It is a collector\u2019s item alright! What impressed me about Bayern there was the way in which, as soon as they scented blood, they went for it. No messing about. Once the third went in it was clear they could streak away. If we hold on a little while we might find out ... An unsparing assessment. It might be the second part, you know. What on earth has gone wrong? In the group\u2019s other game Red Star Belgrade have beaten Olympiakos 3-1, making Spurs\u2019 upcoming double-header with the Serbian side all the more crucial. But for now the story is very much in north London. Any reaction you\u2019d like to send in? Are these really the last days of Poch? I\u2019ve never thought so but what we saw just then was deeply, deeply alarming. I ... errrrm .... well. The boos ring out. This was quite extraordinary. 90 min: Bayern have been brilliant for the final hour but this isn\u2019t normal, is it? There\u2019s something wrong with \u2013 at - Spurs. What on earth is happening? It\u2019s SEVEN! Gnabry has time to shoot right-footed on the edge of the area, sets himself and whips it past Lloris. Spurs have gone; this has been a quite terrible, terrible capitulation and the repercussions may be long-lasting. This is very messy now. Bayern work this beautifully after Alderweireld gives the ball away, Coutinho nudging a delightful first-time pass to Lewandowski with the outside of his foot and the striker finishing devastatingly. 86 min: Ultimately, this has been a schooling for Spurs. It\u2019s as if they are an elastic band that\u2019s stretched beyond its limit. How do you get that old tension back? And there\u2019s the proof for you. This is brilliant. Bayern keep the ball, wait their moment and then Thiago springs Gnabry through with a 60-yard ball from deep. His first touch, as it drops, is quite sumptuous and he runs through before finishing with aplomb. 81 min: Gnabry has been sensational tonight by the way, and not only for his goals. He looks so, so sharp. World-class. Winks now comes off and Lamela comes on, in Spurs\u2019 next throw. 79 min: So gets to the byline but completely messes up a ball back to a teammate. A rare off note from him. 77 min: This game has had very, very few flat spells but we are amid one. Spurs need something fast now, and hope Eriksen can provide it but the sub shoots wastefully over from the edge of the area when there are better options. 74 min: Coutinho drags one wide and I just wonder if Bayern have rode out that little Spurs flurry now. 73 min: Oh, and I missed Perisic coming on for Coman there. 72 min: Lucas Moura comes on for the quiet Alli, and Bayern bring on Javi Martinez for Boateng, who seems to be injured and is being helped off. 70 min: No, it wasn\u2019t given. Coman was on his way down but there was contact. Not clear and obvious, seemingly, and I\u2019m all for VAR letting refs abide by their own decisions. But I still think Spurs got a bit lucky there ... 69 min: It\u2019s very stretched out there now ... and Coman wants a penalty after Rose slides in and seems to take his legs away. Not given and I think that was fortunate. But they\u2019re having another look ... 66 min: Lewandowski does brilliantly to surge down the left and tee up Gnabry, whose eyes light up the the hat-trick ... but a combination of Vertonghen and Alderweireld lurches in to make him miscue. Then Eriksen takes aim from 20 yards and forces a brilliant tip from Neuer! That\u2019s a fine save and stops Spurs giving themselves real hope! 64 min: Oh, that could have been 4-3. In fairness it\u2019s a difficult, dropping ball 16 yards out for Sissoko and he can\u2019t keep it down. Now Ndombele comes off, after fading following that fine first 30, and here is Eriksen ... 63 min: Big 10 minutes or so now. Will Bayern keep hold of things or do Spurs have the wind in their sails? Put away neatly, and now then!! We could have some half-hour ahead of us ... Yes, it\u2019s given. Looked a bit iffy to me. But now they can get back into it through Kane ... Coman clips Rose in the box, and Bayern aren\u2019t happy because his foot was high as he took possession. But Spurs have a lifeline ... I think. VAR check ... 58 min: A question, and one I\u2019d have asked before his lapse just then. How good is Harry Winks? I don\u2019t mean \u201cHow GOOD is Harry Winks?!?!\u201d. I\u2019m more asking if he\u2019s really a top-level midfielder, or got what it takes to be one. I think he can look really nice but I\u2019m not sure. Oh hold on ... 57 min: I\u2019m, errr, not sure what Spurs do now. Of course they try to get back into it. But Bayern are exploiting space ruthlessly and they won\u2019t want this getting any messier. And he\u2019s done it again! Do Bayern think they\u2019re playing Arsenal? Winks is caught on the ball and Bayern are on him like a flash. It\u2019s spirited left to Gnabry, who slots in off the post, and that is the game right there. What a strike this is from the ex-Arsenal man! Just clinical. He gets a run on Alderweireld on the left side after playing a sweet one-two near halfway, cuts inside, feints to shoot and then does \u2013 cracking it viciously across Lloris. Long, long way back for Spurs now. 50 min: Coutinho sends Lewandowski on a run and Spurs are a bit fortunate that a loose touch invites Alderweireld to clear up. The defender then releases Alli with a wonderful diagonal, but his shot doesn\u2019t really work Neuer too hard. 48 min: Vertonghen blocks from Lewandowski and Tolisso shoots wide. Spurs don\u2019t want to concede again. 47 min: \u201cLooking at the team sheet I see at least one Bayern substitute who could come in and make a Cuisance of himself,\u201d notes Peter Oh. I\u2019ll let you all scroll down to work that one out. 46 min: Kane gets an early yellow for leaving his arm out in an aerial challenge. Bayern bring on Thiago for Alaba, who did get a bit of a clatter earlier. Expectations for the second half? If Spurs can ratchet up the tempo again they could still draw or even win this game, definitely. Other scores: Man City 0-0 Dinamo Zagreb Red Star Belgrade 0-1 Olympiakos Lokomotiv Moscow 0-0 Atletico Madrid Juventus 1-0 Bayer Leverkusen Galatasaray 0-0 PSG We\u2019ve got the thriller tonight, so far! Well! Spurs led, were pegged back, could have led again and were full throttle for half an hour. But Bayern seized a measure of control in the latter stages and Lewandowski capitalised brilliantly. All to play for after a rattling good half! It\u2019s been all Bayern for the last 15 minutes and we can\u2019t say this wasn\u2019t coming. Lewandowski is involved early in the move with a quite delicious flick by the right byline, resulting in a penalty claim from Tolisso. But play continues and Lewandowski, by now on the edge of the area, turns and cracks in a lethal low finish! 44 min: ... who flops a low one wide, that snicks off the wall. Not worth the two-minute buildup! Anyhow, Bayern do get a corner out of it, defended well by Alderweireld. 43 min: Ndombele is booked for fouling Coutinho, who had got to his feet very quickly from a previous challenge and retrieved the ball. It\u2019s in a brilliant position for Bayern and the numerous players who would fancy this one. Looks like Lewandowski ... 41 min: Gnabry forces Lloris to beat away a meaty cross-shot, and Spurs still can\u2019t really get out at the moment. 39 min: A Bayern corner from the left. They are seeing much more of the ball now. Coutinho\u2019s delivery is good but Spurs flick it away. 38 min: Matt Richman writes on Son ... \u201cAs a not-Spurs fan, I have to agree with Mr. Ray. Beyond being someone who has yet to have an egregiously negative headline associated with him, he is pacy, has a relentless work ethic, and a direct-but-still-technical style that would make him an asset on literally any team. He\u2019s one of my favourite active players these days; I just wish he wore a different shirt.\u201d 36 min: A continuation of this good Bayern patch sees Alderweireld crane his neck crucially to stop Kimmich\u2019s dink reaching Lewandowski. 35 min: Coman fizzes one wide of Lloris\u2019s left post now. Bayern, after a rocky spell, have come back into it. 33 min: Lewandowski barges Winks off the ball fairly in midfield and suddenly Bayern look awash with possibility ... until Sissoko comes back and blocks Coman off well. Then Alaba crosses and Lewandowski heads well wide. 31 min: Now Son flashes one wide of the near post. He\u2019s really buzzing tonight. Bayern\u2019s defence is not having a good one here and Neuer sensibly goes long from the goal kick. 30 min: This is much more like the tempo we associate with this Tottenham team, I must say. 28 min: Tottenham have a free-kick 25 yards out and a little to the left of centre. Kane is over it ... and a yard over the bar, too. 26 min: \u201cIs there currently a more likeable player than Son?\u201d queries Speakeasy Ray. \u201cHe\u2019s not at a Zola level in that sense but I also don\u2019t know a single footy fan that doesn\u2019t rate him or enjoy watching him.\u201d Spurs might have said \u201cNdombele\u201d if he\u2019d scored while I was pasting that. Found 15 yards out by Aurier, he has a clear shot at goal but allows Neuer to shovel it wide. Spurs ought to be ahead! 25 min: Gnabry is booked for shamelessly tugging Winks back in midfield after losing possession to him. 22 min: Aurier drills against Coman for a corner \u2013 not a penalty, as some of the crowd request, but it\u2019s dealt with. 21 min: Corner kick for Bayern, now, which leads to another. Surely there are more goals in this one. Coutinho shoots straight at Lloris in the aftermath of the second. 19 min: Spurs win a corner after more fine work from Ndombele. This has been non-stop so far. They try a low one but Pavard clears towards Son, who tests Neuer with a 25-yard curler that the keeper clutches. It was probably going wide. 18 min: Kane is denied by Alaba! Son plays it over the top and Neuer is in no man\u2019s land. Kane nicks it around him but, at an angle and on his wrong foot, he doesn\u2019t get enough on his shot towards a vacant net and Alaba can desperately scoop it away! What a start and what a hit! A Bayern skirmish is only half-cleared and Kimmich can take possession 25 yards out. He has too much time to work the ball onto his right foot and lashes a tremendous equaliser into the bottom corner. No sooner were Bayern behind than they\u2019re level! 15 min: Chances at both ends, then, but Spurs have made theirs count. Bayern paid, as so many sides so, for trying to play from deep inside their own area in the face of a lively press. But then ... Tolisso gives the ball away when trying to play from the back and Sissoko, seizing possession, calmly plays in Son \u2013 this time on the right of the box. This time he makes no mistake, slamming it across Neuer, and he scores from his third chance of this still-young game! Views? I think Alli is really, really good. 10 min: Alaba is stricken after Aurier jumps in *very* late on him. Let\u2019s say he was trying to hurdle a tackle; otherwise that looked very bad indeed, like a kind of double stamp. Immense clumsiness after anything else, I think, and luckily Alaba is OK. And Spurs are then nearly very OK as Ndombele finds Son beautifully *again*, but with Kane waiting he allows Neuer to gather a cross-shot from a great position. 8 min: Maybe that\u2019s settled Spurs down a touch. They\u2019re now spraying the ball about the giving each other a few touches. 6 min: Bayern are keeping the ball quite well and looking to beat Spurs\u2019 press when possible. But now Neuer is called into action! Ndombele slides Son through beautifully in the left of the area and the Korean has scored these before ... but not this time, as Neuer saves with his legs. One chance apiece! 4 min: Now Coutinho is sent down the right by Pavard and Alderweireld has to hack away his ball towards a poised Lewandowski. 3 min: Big early chance for Bayern, that was. Vital it didn\u2019t go in from a Spurs confidence point of view. 2 min: Spurs pressing Bayern pretty hard early on, disrupting their efforts to play from the back. This is exactly the kind of thing they need to recapture. But then Bayern do get out and Gnabry is played through the middle for a real chance ... saved by Lloris as he blasts towards goal from 18 yards! They are underway! It is a *proper* European atmosphere in a wet, drenched, snarling north London today. They\u2019re up for this! Real did indeed draw. And, in Man City\u2019s group, Shakhtar won late on at Atalanta. Meanwhile we have a light show at Spurs, and two teams lining up in the tunnel ... \u201cI fancy Spurs to do good tonight.\u201d writes Dave Branton. \u201cPoch has named a pretty strong team to start and they started to show some of the last few seasons brilliance and resilience (what\u2019s that, rapping or something?) against Southampton on Saturday. Come on you Spurs!!\u201d If you\u2019d like more football than just this football, Barry Glendenning has Man City v Dinamo Zagreb just for *you*: Elsewhere, Real Madrid have just come from two down to level it at 2-2 against Club Brugge at the Bernabeu. Still a poor result if it stands, but the Belgians are down to 10 for the final few minutes ... Christian Eriksen is on the naughty step bench again as you\u2019ll see. In the Bayern side Serge Gnabry is back in London \u2013 he was a youngster at Arsenal, you\u2019ll recall, before going on to bigger things. Yes, Alli starts and this is exactly the kind of game you\u2019d fancy him to pop up with something in ... We\u2019ll dig into the nitty gritty shortly \u2013 in the meantime, help yourself to the Bayern latest with this from Ben Fisher: Tottenham Hotspur: Lloris, Aurier, Alderweireld, Vertonghen, Rose, Winks, Sissoko, Ndombele, Alli, Kane, Son. Subs: Sanchez, Lamela, Dier, Gazzaniga, Eriksen, Lucas Moura, Davies. Bayern Munich: Neuer, Pavard, Boateng, Sule, Alaba, Kimmich, Tolisso, Gnabry, Coutinho, Coman, Lewandowski. Subs: Thiago, Javi Martinez, Cuisance, Perisic, Davies, Muller, Ulreich. Referee: Clement Turpin And what a tie this is! So much to like about this one \u2013 and so many strands of narrative too! Can Spurs, on such a downer in the last few weeks, build on Saturday\u2019s win over Southampton by securing the kind of European result that has been their preserve of late? It\u2019s this kind of night that can really kick start a season, or at least set the fires alight once again. Mauricio Pochettino hasn\u2019t become a bad manager overnight; quite the contrary. Nor have Spurs become a bad side. And Bayern ... Bayern are surely there to be defeated, and in so doing banishing many of these early doubts. They\u2019re going along nicely at the moment mind you, topping the Bundesliga as of the weekend. It\u2019s a slightly fresher squad than the one that laboured to defeat against Liverpool last season, with Philippe Coutinho among those firmly involved, so you\u2019d expect a little more zip about them here.

Spurs played with tempo at the outset and it was no surprise when Son put them in front, having gone close on two occasions in the early running. Both of those chances were laid on by Tanguy Ndombele, with the first being the clearer one. Son should have scored but he would make amends. Dele Alli pressed Corentin Tolisso and it was Moussa Sissoko who provided the incision. Son\u2019s low finish had too much on it for Manuel Neuer. Gnabry had shot too close to Lloris in the second minute \u2013 the first sign of his threat \u2013 and, although Bayern equalised through Joshua Kimmich\u2019s beauty from distance, Spurs had their chances in the first half. Harry Kane rounded Neuer only for David Alaba to clear while Ndombele was denied by Neuer after Aurier\u2019s clever pull-back. Lewandowski\u2019s goal on the stroke of half-time was the turning point and, if nothing else, it highlighted the slender nature of the margins at this level. Tolisso won the ball as he lay on the ground and Lewandowski took a touch, spun and fizzed a low shot into the corner from the edge of the area. Lewandowski has scored in every game of Bayern\u2019s season \u2013 apart from the German Super Cup defeat against Borussia Dortmund, which has been their only loss. He is a byword for efficiency. Niko Kovac, the Bayern manager, was compassionate in victory, saying that his team had simply taken an unusually high percentage of their chances and it should be noted that, after Kane\u2019s penalty to make it 4-2, Sissoko and the substitute Christian Eriksen went close for Spurs. As strange as it sounds, Pochettino\u2019s players believed they could fight back at that point. Yet it was a Pochettino soundbite that hung heavy in the air. It was the one about his players giving up once Gnabry had completed his hat-trick. It was unacceptable. The boos from the home crowd rang out with feeling.",

This may have affected City\u2019s rhythm because they were slow to settle, with one needlessly loose pass from Ag\u00fcero indicative of the wider problem.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/01/champions-leage-roundup\">Champions League roundup: Icardi wins it for PSG, Higua\u00edn on target for Juventus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Guardiola had again plumped for the centre-back pairing of Fernandinho and Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi but neither they nor the rest of the defence could stop Dino Peric rising to head at Ederson\u2019s goal from a free-kick. The effort went too high.</p> <p>Yet action in the visitors\u2019 area was served up on a near-permanent loop until half-time, Ag\u00fcero repeatedly receiving the ball and looking to fire a shot off or find Riyad Mahrez.</p> <p>What kept the score level was a dogged Dinamo rearguard and the referee\u2019s refusal to award a penalty when K\u00e9vin Th\u00e9ophile-Catherine seemed to handball near goal. The latter incident was surely an example of what VAR is supposed to clear up but Nenad Bjelica\u2019s team were allowed to escape. Seconds later, David Silva also thought he had a decent penalty shout but Serdar G\u00f6z\u00fcb\u00fcy\u00fck was again not interested in awarding the kick.

City camped in the final third but frustration grew as the yellow wall put up by Croatia\u2019s champions remained firm. That was until, at last, the hosts made the breakthrough when Sterling hammered home a precise Mahrez cross and Guardiola celebrated with the home support.</p> <p>The manager\u2019s decision to bring on Sterling had gained City the ascendancy they deserved. What they did not receive was a penalty when Petar Stojanovic took Sterling down \u2013 but the decision looked correct, Stojanovic connecting with ball first. It did however spark a Guardiola tantrum and the Catalan was booked \u2013 much to his chagrin. This, though, ended as a satisfying evening for him and his side, capped when Sterling broke clear to set up Foden, the midfielder slotting coolly home in the closing moments.</p> <p>Of the 19-year-old, who has never been selected for a senior England squad, Sterling said: \u201cI am buzzing for Phil and I want him in the national team, if he keeps going he will be there.\u201d It is indicative of City\u2019s depth that Foden is not yet a regular in their XI.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Pep Guardiola\u2019s introduction of Raheem Sterling after the break transformed this second group-stage match for Manchester City. Until then Dinamo Zagreb had stymied England\u2019s champions, yet 10 minutes after entering Sterling had a 10th goal in 12 appearances and City were cruising to a second victory and had Group C in their control. The forward completed a scintillating cameo by creating Phil Foden\u2019s second on 95 minutes. \u201cHe\u2019s a player who is always there, he has this talent,\u201d Guardiola said of Sterling. \u201cHe loves to score goals, you always have that feeling. He said a few days ago he missed chances at Everton [where he also scored] but he was always thinking of the next one. I think still he can improve his finishing. Today the pass for Phil was perfect. But still there is a gap to be even more clinical \u2013 but it\u2019s important that all the time he\u2019s there and that\u2019s why he\u2019s been able to score the goals.\u201d Guardiola made five changes from the victory at Everton. Kevin De Bruyne was omitted due to a groin problem \u2013 his availability for the visit of Wolves on Sunday is in the balance \u2013 while Bernardo and David Silva, Benjamin Mendy, Jo\u00e3o Cancelo and Sergio Ag\u00fcero all came in. Sterling, Gabriel Jesus, Oleksandr Zinchenko and Kyle Walker were the others to drop out. Zagreb had won their previous match 4-0 on Friday and arrived hoping to end a dismal streak of 12 consecutive losses in Champions League away group games. Guardiola\u2019s wish that City fans be \u201cseduced\u201d by the competition was not answered during the pre-game anthem, which was booed as has become customary at the Etihad, and the contest was stopped almost instantly following kick-off when Rodri fell awkwardly. This may have affected City\u2019s rhythm because they were slow to settle, with one needlessly loose pass from Ag\u00fcero indicative of the wider problem. Guardiola had again plumped for the centre-back pairing of Fernandinho and Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi but neither they nor the rest of the defence could stop Dino Peric rising to head at Ederson\u2019s goal from a free-kick. The effort went too high. Yet action in the visitors\u2019 area was served up on a near-permanent loop until half-time, Ag\u00fcero repeatedly receiving the ball and looking to fire a shot off or find Riyad Mahrez. What kept the score level was a dogged Dinamo rearguard and the referee\u2019s refusal to award a penalty when K\u00e9vin Th\u00e9ophile-Catherine seemed to handball near goal. The latter incident was surely an example of what VAR is supposed to clear up but Nenad Bjelica\u2019s team were allowed to escape. Seconds later, David Silva also thought he had a decent penalty shout but Serdar G\u00f6z\u00fcb\u00fcy\u00fck was again not interested in awarding the kick. By the interval, City had somehow failed to breach Dominik Livakovic\u2019s goal though Guardiola\u2019s instructions may have been to simply keep on keeping on, given his team\u2019s dominance. What the manager will not have suggested was for Rodri to begin the second half by giving the ball up for Bruno Petkovic to run clear towards Ederson. But as his teammates waited to be played in the No 9 dawdled and the danger fizzled out. Zagreb soon committed their own howler, a mix-up between Peric and Livakovic letting the ball spill to Ag\u00fcero, who could not quite capitalise as the angle tightened. Next, a slick City corner ended with Ilkay G\u00fcndogan chipping the ball to the back post towards a lurking Ag\u00fcero before Livakovic cleared with a punch. Eleven minutes into the second period Guardiola had seen enough, and he took off the muted Bernardo Silva for Sterling in an attempt to find the killer touch that had been absent. City camped in the final third but frustration grew as the yellow wall put up by Croatia\u2019s champions remained firm. That was until, at last, the hosts made the breakthrough when Sterling hammered home a precise Mahrez cross and Guardiola celebrated with the home support. The manager\u2019s decision to bring on Sterling had gained City the ascendancy they deserved. What they did not receive was a penalty when Petar Stojanovic took Sterling down \u2013 but the decision looked correct, Stojanovic connecting with ball first. It did however spark a Guardiola tantrum and the Catalan was booked \u2013 much to his chagrin. This, though, ended as a satisfying evening for him and his side, capped when Sterling broke clear to set up Foden, the midfielder slotting coolly home in the closing moments. Of the 19-year-old, who has never been selected for a senior England squad, Sterling said: \u201cI am buzzing for Phil and I want him in the national team, if he keeps going he will be there.\u201d It is indicative of City\u2019s depth that Foden is not yet a regular in their XI.",

His World Cup debut was against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/sep/10/argentina-england-rugby-world-cup-2011\" title=\"\">the Pumas in Dunedin</a> in 2011, after which he received a \u00a35,000 fine for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/oct/04/rugby-world-cup-manu-tuilagi-mouthguard\" title=\"\">wearing an illegal gumshield</a>.

The big man cuts a more mature figure these days, with his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/oct/09/police-manu-tuilagi-ferry-martin-johnson\" title=\"\">ferry-jumping days</a> now dipped in sepia, and knows he can never resuscitate his 20-year-old self. \u201cI could never be the old me again. It\u2019s different now. The old me used to just go out and play. Now I need to warm up for 30 minutes before I even start.\u201d</p> \n<p>His lengthy injury absences have also taught him to relish whatever rugby experiences he has left. \u201cI know that it is not going to last for ever, that it is not going to last very long so I have got to enjoy the moment while it is here.\u201d For that simple reason he says he enjoys playing for England \u201cmore now than before\u201d and his coaches are seeing as much on the training field.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"04cd30661d4e308fc38ec9632cbf2a40f57e627c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04cd30661d4e308fc38ec9632cbf2a40f57e627c/0_42_2684_1610/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manu Tuilagi is tackled by Gonzalo Tiesi during his World Cup debut against Argentina in Dunedin in 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manu Tuilagi is tackled by Gonzalo Tiesi during his World Cup debut against Argentina in Dunedin in 2011.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Davies/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Mitchell also reckons fatherhood has mellowed the Leicester centre and that he is now ready to make up for lost time. \u201cI think he is in a particularly good space because he is being managed well. He is also just that much older. He has been through a few rugby movies in his time and knows this stage doesn\u2019t always come around. He\u2019s a difficult tackle for anyone and he can also spook players through his defensive pressure. If he gets you man and ball it\u2019s not that comfortable for the attack.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/29/kyle-sinckler-england-argentina-rugby-world-cup\">Kyle Sinckler backs England\u2019s forward \u2018tank\u2019 to handle Argentina\u2019s power</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Tuilagi, however, is keen to play down the \u201cunfinished business\u201d tag, preferring to discuss the collective midfield threat he believes England can pose. There is no official confirmation as yet but it seems all but certain George Ford, Owen Farrell and Tuilagi will line up alongside each other against the Pumas. For the latter, it would be a perfect combination. \u201cI love it. We\u2019ve been together for a long time so we all know how each other plays \u2013 our strengths and our weaknesses.

      "bodyText": "His teammates call him \u201cChief\u201d but for Manu Tuilagi there are only a few weeks left in which to rule the world. He sounds pretty sure this will be his final World Cup, even though he is just 28. \u201cI\u2019ll be too old, mate,\u201d he murmured, asked about the possibility of him being involved in 2023. \u201cI feel it.\u201d Opponents, however, should not breathe too deep a sigh of relief. According to John Mitchell, England\u2019s assistant coach, Tuilagi has the air of someone with \u201ca bit of unfinished business\u201d in a white jersey. \u201cHe has a real presence and looks like he has real strength and belief both in the team and himself,\u201d Mitchell said after England had worked up a training-ground sweat in front of 600 locals and children on a hot, humid morning. The pool game against Argentina on Saturday will also revive memories of the days when Tuilagi was young, carefree and not yet spending half his life on a treatment table. His World Cup debut was against the Pumas in Dunedin in 2011, after which he received a \u00a35,000 fine for wearing an illegal gumshield. Few imagined then that he would still be waiting to taste victory in a World Cup knockout fixture eight years later. Hence why Tuilagi, whose father is a chief of the family\u2019s Samoan village, is assuming nothing in Japan. The big man cuts a more mature figure these days, with his ferry-jumping days now dipped in sepia, and knows he can never resuscitate his 20-year-old self. \u201cI could never be the old me again. It\u2019s different now. The old me used to just go out and play. Now I need to warm up for 30 minutes before I even start.\u201d His lengthy injury absences have also taught him to relish whatever rugby experiences he has left. \u201cI know that it is not going to last for ever, that it is not going to last very long so I have got to enjoy the moment while it is here.\u201d For that simple reason he says he enjoys playing for England \u201cmore now than before\u201d and his coaches are seeing as much on the training field. Mitchell also reckons fatherhood has mellowed the Leicester centre and that he is now ready to make up for lost time. \u201cI think he is in a particularly good space because he is being managed well. He is also just that much older. He has been through a few rugby movies in his time and knows this stage doesn\u2019t always come around. He\u2019s a difficult tackle for anyone and he can also spook players through his defensive pressure. If he gets you man and ball it\u2019s not that comfortable for the attack.\u201d Tuilagi, however, is keen to play down the \u201cunfinished business\u201d tag, preferring to discuss the collective midfield threat he believes England can pose. There is no official confirmation as yet but it seems all but certain George Ford, Owen Farrell and Tuilagi will line up alongside each other against the Pumas. For the latter, it would be a perfect combination. \u201cI love it. We\u2019ve been together for a long time so we all know how each other plays \u2013 our strengths and our weaknesses. I\u2019ve played a few games now alongside Fordy and Farrell and their knowledge of the game is unbelievable. I try and stay as close to them as possible. The way they see the game is different level.\u201d Ford, unsurprisingly, also argues that having two 10s in midfield is a plus that England should not abandon now. \u201cTo have two like\u2011minded players on the field who think like 10s \u2013 where the space is, doing the right thing at the right time, the kicking and passing options \u2013 is a huge strength. I\u2019ve obviously played with Owen through the age groups and a fair bit at senior level so the understanding is good between us.\u201d England\u2019s starting XV could also yet contain the fit-again Mako Vunipola if the management decide he is best deployed from the outset opposite his Saracens clubmate Juan Figallo rather than the bench. The Pumas\u2019 strong set-piece may also conceivably bring Courtney Lawes or Mark Wilson into the equation at blindside, although Tom Curry and Billy Vunipola are certain back-row starters.

Although warning shots have been fired during other protests and police have caused serious injury with rubber bullets and beanbag rounds, this was the first time someone has been hit with a live round.<strong> </strong>The commissioner of police, Stephen Lo Wai-chung, said the use of a live round was \u201clawful and reasonable\u201d and the man had been arrested for assaulting a police officer after he was taken to hospital.</p> <p><strong>Most Australians believe Scott Morrison was wrong to snub the UN climate summit</strong>, but have otherwise <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/02/essential-poll-70-of-australians-think-morrison-was-wrong-to-snub-un-climate-summit\">backed the prime minister\u2019s handling of the relationship with Donald Trump</a>.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Wednesday 2 October. Top stories Hong Kong police have shot a protester with live ammunition for the first time in four months of demonstrations, marking a major escalation in the use of force on a day when China celebrated 70 years of Communist party rule with a triumphalist military parade. Protests called to mark a \u201cnational day of grief\u201d drew tens of thousands of people on to the city\u2019s streets in the most widespread show yet of public anger towards Beijing. Although warning shots have been fired during other protests and police have caused serious injury with rubber bullets and beanbag rounds, this was the first time someone has been hit with a live round. The commissioner of police, Stephen Lo Wai-chung, said the use of a live round was \u201clawful and reasonable\u201d and the man had been arrested for assaulting a police officer after he was taken to hospital. Most Australians believe Scott Morrison was wrong to snub the UN climate summit, but have otherwise backed the prime minister\u2019s handling of the relationship with Donald Trump. The latest Guardian Essential poll, taken in the wake of Morrison\u2019s trip to the US last week, shows that most Australians believe it is important for the prime minister to have a good relationship with the US president, \u201cwhoever they might be\u201d. While 15% of people disagreed with the statement, 77% agreed, with men and Liberal voters most likely to back a strong relationship. The survey of 1,097 people was taken before Tuesday\u2019s revelation that Australia had agreed to help investigate the genesis of the Mueller inquiry into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 US election, which Trump has suggested was a \u201choax\u201d to bring him down. Australia\u2019s vast carbon sink is releasing millions of tonnes of CO2 back into the atmosphere. Australia\u2019s mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrass meadows are absorbing about 20m tonnes of carbon dioxide every year, according to a major study that is the first to measure in detail the climate benefits of the coastal ecosystems. But the study, published in the journal Nature Communications, warns that degradation of these \u201cvegetated coastal ecosystems\u201d was already seeing 3m tonnes of CO2 per year being released back into the atmosphere. The NSW government is, meanwhile, considering legislation that could limit the ability for planning authorities to rule out coalmine projects based on the climate change impact of emissions from the coal once it is burned. World Boris Johnson\u2019s has been criticised in Dublin and Berlin for signalling the possible return of a hard border, which could dash his hopes of entering into decisive Brexit negotiations next week. The UK prime minister is expected to table his long-awaited proposals for the Irish border after making his speech at Conservative party conference in Manchester on Wednesday. Mark Zuckerberg has said Facebook will \u201cgo to the mat\u201d if Elizabeth Warren is elected president and seeks to fulfil her promise to break up America\u2019s tech giants, leaked transcripts show. Having to mount a legal challenge, Zuckerberg said, would \u201csuck for us\u201d. In response, the Massachusetts senator said: \u201cWhat would really \u2018suck\u2019 is if we don\u2019t fix a corrupt system.\u201d Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, has taken the unusual decision to sue the publisher of the Mail on Sunday after the newspaper published a handwritten letter she had sent to her estranged father. The decision came as Prince Harry launched an extraordinary and highly personal attack on the British tabloid press and its treatment of his wife, saying he could no longer be a \u201csilent witness to her private suffering\u201d. One person has been killed and 10 others injured in an attack at a vocational college in eastern Finland, police have said. Local media quoted witnesses as saying a young man with a sword had burst into a classroom. Opinion and analysis A few hours of administrative triage on your superannuation can save you tens of thousands of dollars in the long term, says Xavier O\u2019Halloran, acting director of the Superannuation Consumers\u2019 Centre at Choice. By logging into your MyGov account you can find and consolidate any lost superannuation you may have spread over multiple accounts, accumulating extra fees. Then, using comparison tools and a bit of internet sleuthing, you can ensure your funds are collected into a superannuation account that suits your personal needs. If you manage your super properly, it might only take a few hours of work a year to save upwards of $50,000 in your lifetime. There must be a better way than sending homeless patients back on the street after a hospital visit, writes Ranjana Srivastava: \u201cPerhaps the raison d\u2019etre of a public hospital is to treat medical illness and accept that entrenched poverty, homelessness, drug addiction and chronic mental health issues are simply beyond our remit. This would certainly ease our conscience, but it doesn\u2019t seem right, especially when such patients are the most likely to return to our doors, each time a little sicker, a little more expensive and time-consuming. The truth is, medical illness cannot be separated from socioeconomic factors, which is why good healthcare needs better out-of-hospital supports.\u201d Sport There are many ways to get knocked out of the Champions League and, if that fate does befall Real Madrid, they may just have chosen the daftest of all, writes Sid Lowe. Madrid\u2019s 2-2 draw with Club Brugge was a success, given where they had come from. Alberto Salazar\u2019s ban leaves Mo Farah and UK Athletics with questions to answer, writes Sean Ingle. There is no evidence that Farah cheated \u2013 but sometimes people are judged by the company they keep. Thinking time: Republicans, impeachment and an elusive strategy Republicans are flailing as they seek a coherent strategy against impeachment, writes Tom McCarthy: \u201cRepublicans have \u2018decided on a new strategy\u2019 to address a whistleblower complaint against Donald Trump, joked Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican national committee and a frequent critic of the president. Steele tweeted a slapstick video of a woman trying to sweep sand into the ocean as the tide rolled in. He was lampooning something noted by veterans of the last impeachment fight, targeting Bill Clinton, and others. One week after the Democrats opened their official inquiry, the president and his party are still improvising a defense and have yet to hit on a coherent response. \u201c\u2018It\u2019s as if the Trump campaign has read the Clinton playbook and at every turn opted for the opposite,\u2019 said David Frum, a conservative columnist in the 1990s who was later a speechwriter for George W Bush, writing in the Atlantic. Where Clinton tried to appeal to voters in the middle and stay focused on policy, counting on impeachment to blow over, Frum wrote, Trump is \u2018wholly obsessed with impeachment \u2026 raving nonstop against the whistleblower, the House, and all his political foes \u2013 seen and unseen\u2019.\u201d Media roundup The Sydney Morning Herald reports that Australian women and children were forced to \u201ccower in their tents in fear of their lives overnight as shooting broke out between Islamic State hardliners and Kurdish forces at the al-Hawl camp in Syria\u201d. The Australian writes that Julia Gillard has given the Coalition a \u201cBritish lashing\u201d for its \u201cregrettable\u2019\u2019 foreign aid budget at a forum backed by Britain\u2019s Conservative party. St John of God Bendigo hospital is being sued for alleged medical negligence after a patient died of multiple organ failure following gallstone removal surgery, the ABC reveals. Coming up The water resources minister, David Littleproud, and the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, will embark on a drought tour of NSW and Queensland. A Senate committee will hold hearings into the government\u2019s proposal to drug test welfare recipients.",

      "bodyText": "Most space rocks that hurtle towards Earth burn up in the atmosphere. The moon\u2019s lack of atmosphere means it does not have the same protection, and consequently its surface is peppered with craters. The oldest and largest crater \u2013 a massive 2,000km across and 13km deep \u2013 sits at the far side of the moon. Known as the South Pole Aitken basin, this crater fascinates scientists because it may help reveal what\u2019s inside the moon. Data from Nasa\u2019s Grail mission in 2011 mapped the moon\u2019s gravitational field and showed that the South Pole Aitken basin exerted a strong pull. Scientists speculate that this might be due to a large chunk of nickel and iron embedded beneath the crater \u2013 perhaps the remnants of the asteroid that created it. Or it could be an anomalously dense region in the moon\u2019s interior. Now data from the Chinese Chang\u2019e 4 rover \u2013 which rolled across the crater in January 2019 \u2013 appears to rule out the asteroid remnant theory. Early results indicate that the crater surface is dominated by a common moon crust mineral called plagioclase, while minerals expected in the moon\u2019s interior are rare, suggesting that the impact that created the crater did not pierce the moon\u2019s crust.",

      "bodyText": "Sad to see chatty Priya go! We\u2019ll tira-miss you. Wonder if lawless Henry will be wearing her bobby pins next week? Meanwhile Steph, a.k.a Iron Fringe, sits firmly on the throne for the third time. Thanks to all y\u2019all for the puns and opinions. See you next time for scouring pad sandwich week? Or whatever that was. In the meantime come say hi on braggysnaps or the angry place, or if you want to make me combust like a rum-stuffed bombe, buy my book! Ciao x But sleek bobbed Priya must return to CBeebies. Love that Henry had already picked out what he was gonna nick. And Michael admits he was \u201cflirting with the bottom.\u201d Take off the brooch! It\u2019s cursed! (Obviously) Not...Henry? He\u2019s only just become a man this week. I want to see how he turns out. Priya to go? Steph for Prime Minister? I would eat the heckins out of Henry\u2019s cake. Judges unimpressed, however. A LOT of rum, yup. Hic.\u201d Go on ALice Steph is baking at a professional standard. Rosie\u2019s bridesmaid\u2019s dress of a cake looks like a Joel Schumaker Batman bombe, while Michael has made a \u201cQueen\u2019s mum\u2019s hat\u201d of a pudding. LOL at these adverts saying \u2018get ready for Brexit\u2019 in calm, chirpy tones. YOU GET READY FOR BREXIT you mendacious incompetents. Ooh, Steph has absolutely nailed that bombe. No handshake, but certainly in pole position. I gather that we are all fans of drunken Alice, sweary Henry, and want to eat a bombe tout suite. I am very pleased that tiramisu is getting a kicking from you lot too because I find it an uncomfortably moist proposition. Please someone GIF David and Henry spinning the turntable together, with Unchained Melody piped in over the top. I like the close up shots of Michael\u2019s freckles I definitely want Steph to win. Definitely. Go Steph.\u201d Does Steph possess incriminating footage of David, or have a sniper trained on him at all times? Is he in the same bind as Kevin Bacon? Intriguing development. Henry appears to be nailing this. He set all his layers at once\u2013 which sounded like pie in the sky, but is actually honey mousse in a bowl. Nothing like a turning out a cake to turn one\u2019s stomach out with bake anxiety. I\u2019m actually most excited about Rosie\u2019s flavours. But Steph looks like she\u2019s in control. What do we think is going to go down? Love the boy\u2019s club! Henry, Michael and David discussing the setting temperature of gelatin. The only kind of stag do I can stomach. \u201cI wish I cared,\u201d cuts through Sandi. David is making what looks like a spirulina smoothie, while Rosie is making a Hallmark sunset collage about puppies that love their mums or something? WHAT is Henry doing? Cardboard discs? Simultaneous setting? Love has turned his head. Steph is replacing sponge with a maverick mousse. She\u2019s making a mirror-bombe that doesn\u2019t shine? Is she a genius aiming at a target we can\u2019t see, or has she pressed the self-destruct? The chocolate....what\u2019s it called? Mousse.\u201d Very refreshing from Steph, in amongst all the jaconde this and bavarois that Priya just said Chambord smells like Calpol. CAN WE FACT CHECK THIS. Did she say her sponge was \u2018fatless\u2019 or \u2018backless\u2019? Alice\u2019s bombe sounds more alcoholic than happy hour. Definitely coming round to her. Prue\u2019s hair is like Cruella de Verrine It\u2019s Michael\u2019s birthday as well? If we\u2019d known, we would have baked a cake. Let\u2019s give him star baker for the hell of it! Government keyword-tracking spyware must be going nuts right now @Tallulahbankhead I am well jelly of your custardy wordplay David does excellently, Priya has plus de streusel. She comes in last with Michael, David is second and Alice takes it! KNEW IT. Everyone did very well, though. Bakers fitting biscuit discs to glasses of identical diameter is filling me with anxiety. Henry\u2019s raspberry and cream shirt is vee nice, isn\u2019t it. I want to wear that while eating Alice\u2019s verrine. Did someone say they are dating? How lovely. If the panna cotta isn\u2019t set, the raspberry jelly will fall straight through it. But I bet a video of that happening in slow motion would be the most soothing thing ever. I bet Alice knocks this outta the park. I have a feeling. I would want her to make my verrine terrine. Steph strikes me as the kind of girl who secretly smokes and goes out on schoolnights but because her grades are good she never gets in trouble. A rare and very special breed. Steph and Rosie haven\u2019t made panna cotta? Even I have, many times. The ease to impressiveness ratio is unimpeachable. Seriously where can I get these verrines from? I\u2019m not making one. Does Priya talk a lot? I\u2019ve not really noticed that. M&amp;S are you listening? Look at this #sponcon. Please send puds. Ooh, that DOES look tasty though. Like those little M&amp;S puds you can get. Sounds like an anti-fungal foot powder Henry\u2019s gone with the artisanal Italian bread for his foot long. Also he is wearing a spiderweb brooch in homage to Helena! How come I can\u2019t take a mini pack of KP on a plane but Steph can make a nut meringue coated in nuts, served on a giant nut, with nut-sufferer Rosie right next to her? Open act of war. Michael telling Paul what\u2019s wrong with his own cake is painfully relatable. Looks at David\u2019s beautiful effort. Like a Cezanne. Tastes like one too, apparently. Priya\u2019s overbaked mauve cake is described as unappetising, which on behalf of Prince fans I find offensive. Alice\u2019s cherry cake looks like the money shot in an episode of Dexter. Thank you @StellaCoyle! Am feeling much better. I agree with many of you, meringue is...an odd sensation in the mouth. Sickly polystyrene. The ghost of an egg getting married in Las Vegas. Henry is making what looks like a foot long meatball Subway? In the spirit of Kenneth Williams, I note that Rosie is struggling with her grainy ganache. There\u2019s a cream for that etc Prue is working on her birthday! Happy birthday for several months ago, Prue! Steph is doing an Eton Mess. Make your Brexit jokes\u2026now! There\u2019s a wild-eyed proficiency to Alice I find very scary. I\u2019m going to call her Gone Girl. Scone Girl? You can tell dessert is kryptonite to David. A moment on the lips, an extra seven reps of high intensity training targeting core and hips. Look at him putting star anise in meringue. You want to look at a meringue and think \u2018Mmm, I want to eat that.\u201d -Paul Hollywood earning the metric tonne of gold bullion he\u2019s paid per episode Me neck, me back, meringue and, ah, me cake Michael is right, an Agatha Christie set in the tent would be bananas good. If this show was on ITV they\u2019d have worked in some sort of murder element already. \u201cTo lose one baker may be regarded as a misfortune; to lose both looks like carelessness.\u201d Oscar Wilde.

Took me a week and heavy machinery to hack off my face-briar. Had to call in the fire-briar-brigade. That was a close shave. Hola my cherubim, Welcome to the only Great British Bake Off live blog that is never made from concentrate. Each week I write up the episode\u2019s highs and lows in real time, while everyone else is free to get involved in the comments. Tonight, it\u2019s dessert week. But which baker has muffin to lose, and who mousse pack their bags? If you\u2019re allergic to puns, this may not be the blog for you. Everyone else, I\u2019ll see you here at 8pm!",

      "bodyText": "Up to 6,000 current and former employees at Wesfarmers\u2019 industrial division were underpaid an estimated $15m, Guardian Australia has learned. The head of Wesfarmers industrial division, David Baxby, wrote to staff on Tuesday morning, following inquiries from Guardian Australia last week, to inform them that an internal review had found staff had been underpaid going back as far as 2010. At least 2,000 current and 4,000 former staff of Blackwoods, Workwear Group, Coregas and Greencap were all underpaid in what the company has said was an inadvertent error. The error was only discovered when the industrial division went to upgrade to a new payroll system as part of the move to one-touch payroll. Wesfarmers said the error mostly related to entitlements and car expenses. The company has estimated almost half of the $15m owed to workers is superannuation on loadings and allowances. \u201cThese were inadvertent errors but they are deeply regrettable and we apologise sincerely and unreservedly to our team members who have been affected over a number of years,\u201d Baxby said. PricewaterhouseCoopers was brought in to review the extent of the underpayments and Baxby said the fair work ombudsman had been informed as part of the process. The company was aiming to pay the money owed to workers as quickly as possible, Baxby said. \u201cOur priority is to back pay all affected team members as quickly as possible, including interest, to ensure affected team members are fully compensated,\u201d Baxby said. \u201cWe are also investing heavily in our payroll system, processes and capabilities to fix this issue and ensure it cannot happen again.\u201d The fair work ombudsman, Sandra Parker, said she would be holding Wesfarmers to account. \u201cEach week, another large company is publicly admitting that they failed to ensure staff are receiving their lawful entitlements,\u201d she said. \u201cThis simply is not good enough. \u201cCompanies will be held accountable for breaching workplace laws. Companies and their boards are on notice that we will consider the full range of enforcement options available under the Fair Work Act, including litigation where appropriate.\u201d It is the second underpayments report from Wesfarmers in the past week, after the company\u2019s hardware retailer Bunnings reported last week that it had underpaid superannuation for its 40,000 employees. Wesfarmers confirmed the industrial division underpayment was larger than the Bunnings underpayment, because most Bunnings staff were underpaid less than $200 in total. Guardian Australia reported in July that members of senior management, including the chief executive and chief financial officer at Blackwoods, had left the organisation, but at the time it was played down by Wesfarmers as \u201cnot unusual\u201d and part of a restructure of the organisation.

Since his death on Saturday, a bitter family battle for control of his body has converted his afterlife into a telenovela. Jos\u00e9 Jos\u00e9 \u2013 known as El Pr\u00edncipe de la Canci\u00f3n, or the Prince of Song \u2013 died in Miami on Saturday. He was 71 and was known to have pancreatic cancer. At first, things all followed the celebrity death rulebook: tributes rolled in for the legendary entertainer famed for his vocal range, impeccable suits and redemptive struggle with alcohol and cocaine abuse. Social media buzzed with footage showing passengers on a Mexico City bus bursting into a spontaneous rendition of his most famous hit, El Triste, or The Sad One. But public mourning quickly gave way to fascination with a family feud, stoked by the showbiz media on both sides of the US-Mexico border. The singer, whose legal name was Jos\u00e9 R\u00f3mulo Sosa Ortiz, had been living in Miami since February 2018 with Sarita Sosa, his youngest daughter and only child from his third marriage. Jos\u00e9 Joel and Marysol Sosa, his other two children from an earlier marriage, have publicly accused Sarita of kidnapping their father, preventing him from seeing them, and manipulating him into signing over control of his life and legacy. The day after the singer\u2019s death, the two elder siblings were filmed pleading with Sarita to tell them where their father\u2019s body was as they visited funeral parlours around Miami, pursued by a swarm of reporters. \u201cWe have every right to see my father,\u201d Marysol told the Mexican network TV Azteca. \u201cMy half-sister has a lot to explain to me \u2013 and to all of Mexico.\u201d Sarita, meanwhile, gave two studio interviews in which she insisted she had never tried to block her siblings seeing their dad. \u201cAside from our differences, now is the time to be united,\u201d she told the US network Telemundo. \u201cIf they come out and say something else, that\u2019s a matter for them.\u201d The public\u2019s mounting obsession with the story has been further fuelled by mudslinging between prominent showbiz TV presenters accusing each other of taking sides, or paying for exclusives. Postmortem controversies are not uncommon for Mexico\u2019s most iconic entertainers. After the singer Juan Gabriel died in 2016, rumours spread that he was still alive and that he faked his own death to escape the pressures of his fame. The whirlwind around Jos\u00e9 Jos\u00e9 calmed after the Mexican consulate in Miami confirmed that the body was in fact in a funeral parlour under the control of Sarita. But it remained unclear if Jos\u00e9 Joel and Marysol had seen their father\u2019s body \u2013 let alone in which country he would finally be buried and who will inherit his estate.",

Thanks for reading and commenting. Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s main events:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The prime minister was facing fresh questions over his links to Jennifer Arcuri after more damaging headlines this evening.</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/oct/01/brexit-latest-news-boris-johnson-conservative-conference-interviewed-as-ireland-dismisses-uk-border-plan-as-non-starter-live-news?page=with:block-5d938ace8f081108db9c04f9#block-5d938ace8f081108db9c04f9\">The Guardian revealed</a> that a Whitehall official who ran the scheme that granted Arcuri a coveted entrepreneur visa had worked for Boris Johnson when he was mayor. Johnson had earlier <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/oct/01/brexit-latest-news-boris-johnson-conservative-conference-interviewed-as-ireland-dismisses-uk-border-plan-as-non-starter-live-news?page=with:block-5d937c3e8f08fbb0c171eea4#block-5d937c3e8f08fbb0c171eea4\">refused repeatedly to deny</a> he had had an affair with Arcuri.</li> \n   <li><strong>The UK will put forward \u201cvery constructive and far-reaching proposals\u201d to the EU for an alternative to the backstop, the prime minister pledged. </strong>Boris Johnson made the claim after reports suggested the UK wanted to set up border checks a few miles either side of the Irish frontier, rather than on it. Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/oct/01/brexit-latest-news-boris-johnson-conservative-conference-interviewed-as-ireland-dismisses-uk-border-plan-as-non-starter-live-news?page=with:block-5d93400f8f084ab84173069d#block-5d93400f8f084ab84173069d\">distanced himself</a> from the proposals, though he said some checks being needing to be carried out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/oct/01/brexit-latest-news-boris-johnson-conservative-conference-interviewed-as-ireland-dismisses-uk-border-plan-as-non-starter-live-news?page=with:block-5d9321f78f081108db9bff2b#block-5d9321f78f081108db9bff2b\">was simply the \u201creality\u201d</a>.

the reported border proposals unacceptable</a>.</li> \n   <li><strong>The prime minister addressed those and a range of others issues during a host of broadcast interviews.</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/oct/01/brexit-latest-news-boris-johnson-conservative-conference-interviewed-as-ireland-dismisses-uk-border-plan-as-non-starter-live-news?page=with:block-5d9306d78f084ab841730458#block-5d9306d78f084ab841730458\">You can see a comprehensive summary of those here</a>.</li> \n   <li><strong>Priti Patel promised to \u201cend the free movement of people once and for all\u201d.</strong> The home secretary delivered her conference speech in the early evening, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/oct/01/brexit-latest-news-boris-johnson-conservative-conference-interviewed-as-ireland-dismisses-uk-border-plan-as-non-starter-live-news?page=with:block-5d936d988f084ab8417308d6#block-5d936d988f084ab8417308d6\">promising an Australian-style points system</a> to replace the principle.</li> \n   <li><strong>The automatic early release of some prisoners is \u201cmadness\u201d, according to the justice secretary.</strong>

the Tory party conference</a> he wants to end the system under which nearly all offenders sentenced to immediate custody are released at the midway point on licence in the community.</li> \n   <li><strong>The Conservative MP, Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, <a

<li><strong>Dover faces losing \u00a31bn in trade per week under a no-deal Brexit, it was claimed.</strong> Despite extensive preparations, the port\u2019s chief executive <a

It may not seem necessary to say that the Tories are against \u201cgang leaders, drug barons, thugs and terrorists\u201d, but Boris Johnson reportedly decided to make Patel home secretary because her no-nonsense authoritarianism makes her popular with party members.

The Commons is sitting, of course, because the normal conference recess was cancelled after the government lost a vote last week.</p> \n  <p>In response to a question from the Tory MP <strong>Philip Hollobone</strong>, Javid said the UK would no longer owe the EU \u00a339bn if it left without a deal. Hollobone asked for an assurance that the UK would be able to keep the money in a no-deal situation. And Javid replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The \u00a339bn is based on a deal. If there is no deal and we end up leaving with no deal that 39bn number is no longer relevant.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Javid may be right to say the exact \u00a339bn figure (a UK government assessment of how much it would pay under the complicated formula in the withdrawal agreement) would not be relevant under a no-deal Brexit. But government officials believe much or most of this money would still have to be paid, because the financial obligations would still be outstanding.</p> \n  <p>The Labour MP <strong>Helen Hayes</strong> asked Javid if he was confident that hedge funds shorting the pound, \u201csome of which have donated to the prime minister\u2019s leadership campaign and to the Conservative party, have no inside information about the planning or timing of a no-deal Brexit\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Javid replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>That really is such a ridiculous suggestion and it doesn\u2019t deserve an answer.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-01T11:56:48.315Z\">at 12.56pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d93362a8f084ab841730638\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-01T11:24:53.706Z\">12.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Jacob Rees-Mogg,</strong> the leader of the Commons, has said that some of the 21 Tories who lost the whip after rebelling over Brexit last month could be readmitted to the parliamentary party. In an interview for Moggcast, his ConservativeHome podcast, he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I always believe in politics in being as generous as you possibly can be. But you cannot have a situation where people are trying to put Jeremy Corbyn in charge of the order paper. </p> \n   <p>So, look, if they are willing to show that they are willing to support a Conservative government deliver a Conservative programme, and pull back from what they did before, I think generosity is in the nature of conservatism, and the Conservative party is a broad church and needs to remain a broad church ...</p> \n   <p>So how do we get on from here? Well, let\u2019s see if there are any other votes which give them the chance to come back, but I think a number of them are retiring and have no interest in coming back, so it won\u2019t be everybody.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He also said there was no obvious way in which the government would be able to get around the Benn Act, which is designed to rule out a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. Asked about potential flaws in the legislation, he replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The law is the law as it is.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it from us this evening. Thanks for reading and commenting. Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s main events: The prime minister was facing fresh questions over his links to Jennifer Arcuri after more damaging headlines this evening. The Guardian revealed that a Whitehall official who ran the scheme that granted Arcuri a coveted entrepreneur visa had worked for Boris Johnson when he was mayor. Johnson had earlier refused repeatedly to deny he had had an affair with Arcuri. The UK will put forward \u201cvery constructive and far-reaching proposals\u201d to the EU for an alternative to the backstop, the prime minister pledged. Boris Johnson made the claim after reports suggested the UK wanted to set up border checks a few miles either side of the Irish frontier, rather than on it. Johnson distanced himself from the proposals, though he said some checks being needing to be carried out was simply the \u201creality\u201d. Dublin has made clear it considers the reported border proposals unacceptable. The prime minister addressed those and a range of others issues during a host of broadcast interviews. You can see a comprehensive summary of those here. Priti Patel promised to \u201cend the free movement of people once and for all\u201d. The home secretary delivered her conference speech in the early evening, promising an Australian-style points system to replace the principle. The automatic early release of some prisoners is \u201cmadness\u201d, according to the justice secretary. Robert Buckland told the Tory party conference he wants to end the system under which nearly all offenders sentenced to immediate custody are released at the midway point on licence in the community. The Conservative MP, Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, was asked to leave the conference after what the party described as a \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d incident. Police were called to deal with the issue on Tuesday afternoon. Dover faces losing \u00a31bn in trade per week under a no-deal Brexit, it was claimed. Despite extensive preparations, the port\u2019s chief executive told a fringe event he still expects to see a huge downturn. And, if you\u2019d like to read more, my colleagues Simon Murphy and Matthew Weaver have our main story: Boris Johnson has arrived at a DUP reception at the Tory party conference, alongside the party\u2019s leader, Arlene Foster. Here\u2019s a clip of the home secretary, Priti Patel, setting out her desire to \u201cend the free movement of people once and for all\u201d during her party conference speech earlier this evening (see 5.04pm): The chancellor, Sajid Javid, has dropped the strongest hint yet that he may be about to scrap inheritance tax. At a fringe event \u2013 and on the eve of Boris Johnson\u2019s first conference speech as prime minister \u2013 he was asked by a party member if he would consider getting rid of the \u201cmost painful tax\u201d to affect the public. Javid hinted there could be significant reform on the horizon, and he also confirmed a budget would be held this year. He said: We\u2019ve already made some sensible reforms in that tax but I hear what you\u2019re saying and you\u2019re not the only one. I shouldn\u2019t say too much now but I understand the arguments against that tax. I do think when people pay taxes already through work, or through investments and capital gains and other taxes, there\u2019s a real issue with then asking them on that income to pay taxes all over again. Sensible changes have already been made but it is something that is on my mind. Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister has rejected reports that a time-limited backstop could help solve the Brexit impasse. Simon Coveney has told RT\u00c9 radio: If we put an actual time limit on the backstop, well then there is no onus \u2013 particularly on the UK side, potentially \u2013 to find alternative solutions to the backstop that may be more permanent because it will simply fall after a certain period of time. So, if you\u2019re talking about a backstop and, if you can\u2019t credibly answer the question: What happens on the border question at the end of it, of that time limit? Well, then it\u2019s not a backstop at all. It was claimed earlier in the afternoon that EU27 governments had privately discussed offering the time limit. Bloomberg cited unnamed sources in the report and a European commission spokesman was quoted as saying: The EU is not considering this option at all. We are waiting for the UK to come forward with a legally operational solution that meets all the objectives of the backstop. There are fresh questions for Boris Johnson this evening, after the Guardian reveals that a Whitehall official who ran the scheme that granted Jennifer Arcuri a coveted entrepreneur visa had worked for Johnson when he was mayor of London. My colleagues, Simon Murphy and Matthew Weaver, write that Arcuri \u2013 who is at the centre of a conflict of interest row over her friendship with Johnson \u2013 beat nearly 2,000 applicants to gain one of 200 sought-after tier 1 entrepreneur visas on the government\u2019s Sirius programme after Johnson helped promote her firm, Innotech, by giving keynote speeches at her events. They add: The Guardian has learned that Paola Cuneo, the then director of the Sirius programme, previously spent two-and-a-half years working in a senior post at London &amp; Partners (L&amp;P), the official mayoral promotional agency which Johnson had responsibility for while he was in City Hall. Cuneo, Arcuri and Johnson attended the same Innotech event in October 2013, two months before the company joined the Sirius scheme. A whistleblower has told the Guardian: Innotech stood out compared to other startups in the programme, which had a much higher potential to scale up \u2026 I could not understand why we were giving so much attention and extra funds to Innotech. Earlier this evening, Johnson refused three times to deny having an affair with Arcuri during an interview with Sky News. Boris Johnson posted this on Twitter earlier, in a reference to the video showing an aide snatching a coffee cup from his hands because it was disposable. Now there has been a run on those mugs, Sky\u2019s Aubrey Allegretti reports. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is now taking over. Speaking at a debate about gang-related violence, Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader, was asked about the effects of Conservative party voters\u2019 \u201cafter-dinner activities\u201d (aka taking cocaine) on rising violent crime rates. After it was clarified that \u201cafter-dinner activities\u201d did not refer to the groping allegations against Boris Johnson, Duncan Smith said it needed to be pointed out that \u201cthe consequences of buying illegal drugs is that somebody dies\u201d. He said: You didn\u2019t pull the trigger, you didn\u2019t stab them, but the money you gave them has gone up the chain and has been used to buy the guns and knives and to pay off the kids that are doing the violent crime, so I think that\u2019s a very simple message to give. Yes of course we can crack down on the symptoms of that, which are criminal behaviour and violence, but the truth is you can crack down on your behaviour by saying: \u2018I\u2019m not going to do this any longer because I can\u2019t bear the thought that somebody out there gets abused, killed or doesn\u2019t make it to 22 because I was too busy indulging myself.\u2019 Shaun Bailey, the Tory party\u2019s London mayoral candidate, added that it was not just people in the Tory shires who used cocaine, but also in Labour-voting London. \u201cActually, most coke is sold in London,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bigger market and it\u2019s sold in all the cool places. It isn\u2019t just shire Tories [taking] coke. I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s not who [takes] it. It\u2019s the cool people who [take] it.\u201d And in an interview with the BBC, Boris Johnson has said the UK will put forward some \u201cvery constructive and far-reaching proposals\u201d to the EU for an alternative to the backstop. Johnson said there would have to be new customs checks on the island of Ireland, away from the border. If the EU is going to insist on on customs checks as we come out as it is, then we will have to accept that reality. And there will have to be a system for customs checks away from the border. Now, we think those checks can be absolutely minimal and non-intrusive and won\u2019t involve new infrastructure. (The EU would say that it is the UK creating the need for customs checks, by leaving the customs union.) Johnson said it was preferable to have customs checks on north/south trade (ie between Northern Ireland and Ireland) than on east/west trade (ie, between Northern Ireland and Great Britain). He explained: Just to set this in context for you, it\u2019s important to understand that trade north/south of the border is dwarfed by trade east/west, ie from Northern Ireland to GB. So it would be wrong to, as it were, to keep Northern Ireland in a customs union with the EU and to create new checks down the Irish Sea for customs. But the UK is proposing to accept an all-island zone for agrifoods, which would mean sanitary and phytosanitary checks taking place in the Irish Sea, on goods travelling from Britain to Northern Ireland, not for goods crossing the Ireland/Northern Ireland border. There are some of these checks in place alredy, but Johnson acknowledged that under his plan there would be more. He said: Insofar as we\u2019ve made a big move on sanitary, which we have, then that will logically imply some more checks down the Irish Sea. But we think that\u2019s liveable with, provided it\u2019s done in the right way. The full transcript of the interview with Laura Kuenssberg is here. In an interview with Sky News, Boris Johnson has refused three times to deny having an affair with Jennifer Arcuri, the businesswoman whose company received sponsorship from a mayoral fund when Johnson was in City Hall. Opposition parties might have won their battle to keep the Commons in session while the Conservative conference is taking place, but they can\u2019t as yet agree on everything \u2013 particularly on the idea of a possible government of national unity. All the parties believe that if Boris Johnson tried to force a no-deal Brexit then their tactic of last resort would be a no-confidence vote, replacing him with an interim PM. However, while the Liberal Democrats insist it cannot be Corbyn, Labour say he is the only choice. Speaking to reporters at parliament, Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said he hoped Jo Swinson could change her mind: I was brought up a Catholic and I am a great believer in the powers of conversion. But the Lib Dem leader argues that the Corbyn option is simply impossible, as he would not win the support of rebel former Conservative MPs and others whose votes would be needed. A spokesman for Swinson said: Jo is a great believer in the power of mathematics. Jeremy Corbyn does not have the numbers and needs to make clear who he would support if we need an emergency government. There is wider disagreement. While the Lib Dems are seeking a cross-party temporary government led by a backbench grandee, such as Ken Clarke or Harriet Harman, Corbyn\u2019s office have called for a \u201cstrictly time-limited caretaker administration\u201d, a Labour-only government in office for a matter of days purely to extend the Brexit deadline and call an election. The assumption is that if the alternative was no deal, one side would blink, but it remains to be seen who, and when. That was the third most important speech at this conference. Technically Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, outranks Priti Patel, the home secretary, in cabinet, but Raab was given a low-profile slot on Sunday and his speech was under-powered. Patel\u2019s speech was probably the most rightwing by a Tory home secretary at least since Michael Howard\u2019s \u201cprison works\u201d one in 1993. In policy terms, it was relatively light. There were three main announcements, but they all have so little money attached they are virtually cost-free: a fund to allow up to 60% of officers to be equipped with tasers (\u00a310m); more activity to tackle county line drugs gangs (\u00a320m); and a safer streets fund (\u00a310m). But what it lacked in policy heft, it made up for in rhetorical overkill. It may not seem necessary to say that the Tories are against \u201cgang leaders, drug barons, thugs and terrorists\u201d, but Boris Johnson reportedly decided to make Patel home secretary because her no-nonsense authoritarianism makes her popular with party members. It remains to be seen if the public at large will react in the same way. More interesting were her constant references to the need to obey the will of the people. (See 4.01pm.) She sounded like someone who would be happy to see parliamentary democracy replaced with a more direct form of democracy, bypassing the need for parliamentarians exercising their judgment. If the Brexit party ever takes power, their ministers will give speeches like this. Patel got her loudest applause when she invoked Margaret Thatcher. Margaret Thatcher knew that if you made the British people your compass, if you took time to understand their lives and their priorities, then your direction would always be true. This suited Patel\u2019s \u201cwill of the people\u201d agenda, but in historical terms it was totally wrong. Thatcher would probably have loved this speech. But she was a conviction politician who knew that, if you just use British people as your compass, you will be all over the place because people keep changing their minds. Patel\u2019s vision \u2013 almost government-by-plebiscite \u2013 was certainly not hers. And here is the peroration. This party, our Conservative party, is backing those who put their lives on the line for our national security. So as we renew our place as the party of law and order in Britain, let the message go out from this hall today: To the British people - we hear you. To the police service - we back you. And to the criminals, I simply say this: We are coming after you. Conservative party conference day three \u2013 as it happened Patel praises Margaret Thacher. Only the Conservative party is driven by the people\u2019s priorities and that means backing our police, our communities and our great country. That pragmatic approach, grounded in the good sense of the British people, keeps us focused on what truly matters today. That\u2019s the lesson I took from the person who inspired me to join our party. A Conservative prime minister first elected 40 years ago, this year. Margaret Thatcher knew that if you made the British people your compass, if you took time to understand their lives and their priorities, then your direction would always be true. \u201cMy policies,\u201d she said, \u201care based not on some economics theory, but on things I and millions like me were brought up with: an honest day\u2019s work for an honest day\u2019s pay; live within your means; pay your bills on time; and support the police.\u201d That advice is as sound today as it was 40 years ago. Patel criticises Labour. This daughter of immigrants needs no lectures from the north London metropolitan liberal elite. That\u2019s what you get with a government that is driven by the people\u2019s priorities. Of course, there will be only two dissenting voices: Diane Abbott and Jeremy Corbyn. Because the choice isn\u2019t just who the people want to be our next prime minister. It\u2019s also about who the people want to be their next home secretary. Do we really want a Labour home secretary who would leave our communities and our country less safe? Patel says the Brexit referendum result must be honoured. She praises Boris Johnson\u2019s role in the campaign. And she turns to immigration. As home secretary at this defining moment in our country\u2019s history, I have a particular responsibility when it comes to taking back control. It is to end the free movement of people once and for all. Instead we will introduce an Australian-style points-based immigration system. One that works in the best interests of Britain. One that attracts and welcomes the brightest and the best. One that supports brilliant scientists, the finest academics and leading people in their fields. And one that is under the control of the British government. Patel says the third reason for backing the police is because that is what people want. This is a government driven by the people\u2019s priorities. Hardworking, honest, law-abiding people whose needs are humble, whose expectations are modest and whose demands of their government are simple. They want us to listen. They ask us to respond. And they expect us to do what we say. From crime, to immigration, to leaving the European Union, we are ready to listen and to do what they want. It\u2019s called democracy. That shouldn\u2019t really be a controversial statement. They are the masters and we are their servants. Patel says she is announcing a \u00a320m fund to tackle county lines drug gangs and a \u00a325m safer streets fund. She says she will set up a fund to allow police chiefs to equip their officers with tasers. She also says she is establishing a police covenant. I have been humbled by the officers I have met and the experiences they have shared with me. This is why I have personally accelerated work to establish the police covenant. This is a pledge to do more as a nation to help those who serve our country. To recognise the bravery, the commitment and the sacrifices of serving and former officers. And we will enshrine this into law. Second, says Patel, the police need support \u201cto remove the grip gangs and organised criminals have on our communities\u201d. She goes on: They just don\u2019t care who they hurt or abuse. The kingpins of these criminal gangs are exploiting children. Forcing them to carry crack cocaine and heroin across rural and coastal communities. Threatening them into carrying guns and knives as \u201cprotection\u201d. Manipulating them into killing innocent people. Faced with this new and growing danger, our police will know that I will back them to get this under control. Patel says more officers are being recruited, and she has given the police more powers over stop and search. There are three reasons: Firstly, because backing the forces of law and order is central to our DNA as Conservatives. Giving people the security they need to live their lives as they choose is an essential part of our freedom. We recognise that freedom and security are not opposites, but equals. And that ensuring people can live their lives free from fear is the essential foundation for a life of liberty. Here is the opening quote. Today, here in Manchester, the Conservative party takes its rightful place as the party of law and order in Britain once again. We stand with the brave men and women of our police and security services. And we stand against the criminals. The gang leaders, drug barons, thugs and terrorists who seek to do us harm. We say that proudly and without apology. As the party that has always backed the forces of law and order, and we always will. Priti Patel, the home secretary, is speaking now. She starts by saying the Conservatives have restored their reputation as the party of law and order. The Conservatives have said that Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown has been asked to leave the conference after the incident earlier. (See 2.58pm.) The party said he had tried to take someone into the international lounge who did not have the relevant pass. That person was stopped by a member of staff. Clifton-Brown then \u201cremonstrated\u201d with the staff member, leading to security being called. A party spokesman said: The incident was totally unacceptable. Geoffrey has been asked to leave conference and we are establishing all of the facts to see if further action is necessary. We will always adopt a zero tolerance approach to any inappropriate behaviour towards our hardworking staff. In 2015 Michael Gove was justice secretary and, in his speech to the Tory conference, he questioned the need to keep some prisoners in jail and stressed the importance of rehabilitation. The Daily Express hated the speech (always a good sign, if you\u2019re a progressive), but my colleague Martin Kettle wrote a column saying liberals should be cheering Gove on. Four years on, and the wheel has turned full circle. Robert Buckland is now justice secretary and, although he has never been seen as an arch-authoritarian, Boris Johnson has an election to win and the Tories are back in favour of locking more people up. As my colleague Jamie Grierson reports in his preview, Buckland announced plans to stop violent and sex offenders in England and Wales being automatically released halfway through their jail sentence Here is Jamie\u2019s story. And here is an extract from Buckland\u2019s speech. Some form of earlier release has its place in the criminal justice system. It can be used to incentivise good behaviour. But this is not the system we have, conference. There used to be a tougher system. But in 2005, Labour replaced it with automatic release at the halfway point. It didn\u2019t matter to Labour if prisoners posed a risk to the public. It didn\u2019t matter to Labour if prisoners misbehaved in prison. It didn\u2019t matter to Labour if criminals didn\u2019t show remorse. This is madness. From my colleague Peter Walker During leaders\u2019 questions in the D\u00e1il, Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach, was asked about RT\u00c9\u2019s leak of the UK\u2019s government\u2019s plan (or non-plan - see 1.23pm) for customs clearance sites away from the border on the island of Ireland. He said he had not seen the \u201cnon-paper\u201d from the UK, but he was glad Boris Johnson had rejected it. I\u2019m conscious when answering your question that I am talking about non-papers that I haven\u2019t seen. I was aware of their existence, and it was public knowledge in the last week or two, that the UK provided non-papers to the EU taskforce on the basis of confidentiality and not to be shared with member states. I very much welcome Boris Johnson\u2019s words today when he disowned the non-papers. Had he not, in my view, it would be hard evidence of bad faith by the UK government. Varadkar said he expected the UK government to honour promises to avoid border checks. The UK government promised no hard border or associated controls or checks and we expect the British government to honour that promise made in the withdrawal agreement. People here don\u2019t want a customs border between north and south and no British government should seek to impose customs posts against the will of the people on the island of Ireland. I\u2019m interested in what Northern Ireland businesses have to say, in what retailers say. The UK has not been listening to businesses: the Freight Trade Association say it contradicts all their advice to the government; Manufacturing NI rejected them out of hand. I would ask anyone to listen to the voices of Northern Ireland, from businesses to farmers, to people, who are saying no to customs posts, and we are saying no too. He also suggested Johnson did not appreciate the case for the backstop. Referring to his conversation with Johnson at a recent UN meeting in New York, Varakdar said Johnson has spoken about the need for no checks at the border, but had not explained where they would take place. It is his [Johnson\u2019s] view that the UK should leave the EU whole and entire, to use his language, to leave the customs union. As I explained to him in New York, there is a reason we came up with the deal that we did after two years with Mrs May and what the backstop provides for is a single customs territory. That satisfied our demand and desire that there not be customs checks north and south, or east and west, and that\u2019s why we came up with the backstop, why it is the best solution. We spent two years going up and down rabbit holes, because we needed a solution that avoided customs posts. This is what the Press Association has filed about the incident at the conference earlier that led to security being called and part of the venue being cordoned off. A senior Tory MP is understood to have clashed with security at the Conservative party conference, prompting a lockdown of part of the venue. Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown was involved in what a doorman described as a \u201csmall misunderstanding\u201d at the International Lounge in the conference centre. Police said an attendee tried to enter the lounge without the relevant pass, leading security staff to intervene. PA understands Clifton-Brown was trying to enter the room with a guest. The \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d led to a lockdown of some areas, including the press room, at the Manchester Central Convention Centre for around 20 minutes. The Cotswolds MP told the PA news agency: \u201cI\u2019ve got nothing further to say about it. I don\u2019t want to comment on it, really.\u201d A staff member guarding the door of the International Lounge said the incident was sparked by a disagreement. \u201cIt was a small misunderstanding,\u201d the man said. Greater Manchester police said in statement: \u201cAt around 1.45pm on Tuesday 1 October 2019, an attendee to the Conservative party conference attempted to enter the International Lounge area of the conference without the relevant pass. \u201cSecurity staff intervened and resolved the situation without any breach of security occurring.\u201d Customs infrastructure even 5 miles from the Irish border risked breaking Brexit laws passed by the House of Commons this year, parliament has been told. In oral questions in the House of Commons, the Labour MPs Pat McFadden and Angela Eagle raised section 10 (2) (b) of the Withdrawal Act 2019. It states categorically that there can be no \u201cborder arrangements between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after exit day which feature physical infrastructure, including border posts, or checks and controls, that did not exist before exit day and are not in accordance with an agreement between the United Kingdom and the EU\u201d. McFadden told James Durridge, who was taking questions for the government, that it had \u201cobligations to abide by the law\u201d. He asked: Would he regard such physical infrastructure a few miles back from the border as incompatible with the legislation that this house has passed? Durridge replied: \u201cI will write to the honourable gentleman original - and confirm what I think is the bleeding obvious.\u201d The point made by Labour backbenchers is one that has also raises concerns with Peter Hain, the Labour former Northern Ireland secretary, who said it it would be \u201cthe achilles heel\u201d of government plans to dodge commitments in Theresa May\u2019s deal. The incident that led to a part of the conference centre being closed and police being called involved the Conservative MP Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, my colleague Rowena Mason reports. Clifton-Brown is treasurer of the Conservative 1922 Committee. We are still waiting for a full statement from the party. The government cannot rely on European Union law to override the act of parliament forcing Boris Johnson to seek an extension to Brexit talks, a former EU senior legal adviser has said. Jean-Claude Piris, a former head of the EU council legal service, said suggestions the government could rely on EU law to trump the Benn Act had no legal basis. In emailed comments to the Guardian he said: EU law is far from always having direct effect. In the case of article 50, the decision of a member state to leave the EU must be taken in conformity with the constitutional requirements of that state. Thus no direct effect. The authorities to judge if British constitutional requirements are being respected are the British competent ones. He was responding to suggestions from the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, that EU law could be used to override the Benn Act, which mandates the prime minister to seek an extension if no Brexit deal has been agreed by 19 October. Raab, who served a four-month stint as Brexit secretary before resigning over Theresa May\u2019s deal, hinted the government was looking at article 50 to override the Benn Act, in a recent interview with the Mail on Sunday. Here is Boris Johnson telling Channel 4 News that he does not know why he has not been scheduled to do an interview with them today. Presumably Channel 4 is still in the doghouse after Dorothy Byrne, its head of news, used the MacTaggart lecture at Edinburgh to call Johnson a \u201cknown liar\u201d. From LBC\u2019s Alex Cadier We\u2019ve been told by party sources that there has been an \u201cincident\u201d at the Conservative party conference. A small area between the press area and the hall has been closed off and police are in attendance. The party is due to issue a statement soon. At the moment that\u2019s all we know. But officials don\u2019t seem particularly alarmed, and away from the cordoned off area everything is carrying on as normal, so at the moment it does not appear too serious. Despite extensive preparations at Dover, the port\u2019s chief executive said it still expects to see a drop in trade worth \u00a31bn a week should Britain leave the EU without a deal. Addressing a ConservativeHome/Port of Dover fringe event at the conference, the transport minister George Freeman confirmed the government was assuming that disruption would roughly halve the traffic on Britain\u2019s main trading link for three months; the drop would range from 40% to 60%. Doug Bannister, the chief executive of Port of Dover, said the assumed drop in traffic would cut \u00a31bn in trade every week. He said: That\u2019s how critical it is. If there\u2019s a no-deal Brexit, it\u2019s not going to be OK. But people are doing all they can to ensure Britain keeps trading. Freeman said he hoped goodwill would prevail should a deal not be agreed by 31 October. Asked what preparations the government was making for \u201cmalign interventions\u201d, such as a potential blockade by French fishermen, Freeman said he had seen cabinet papers showing \u201cthe Ministry of Defence are actively looking at it\u201d, raising the potential for alarming escalation. The Freight Transport Association said its preparations meant it did not expect \u201cwholesale meltdown\u201d but people could expect to see less fresh produce. James Hookham, the deputy chief executive of the FTA, said: \u201cThere will be changes to what people can expect to see in the shops undoubtedly.\u201d He said the FTA was holding 140 training sessions in the next few weeks to educate hauliers about the potential paperwork needed. But he said questions still remained unanswered, even in an intricate flowchart issued by the Department for Transport to explain customs and border processes. He said: The biggest unknown in our book is what the French and EU will demand in terms of British goods imported into the EU. With delays of up to five days forecast for hauliers doing return border crossings, Hookham said he had advised hauliers to take out additional insurance for cargo, especially perishable goods. He also said the full impact of a no-deal Brexit on Dover, Calais and Kent would probably not be seen until at least Monday 4 November, due to a long weekend in much of Europe, starting with a public holiday on 1 November (a celebration unrelated to Britain\u2019s departure from the EU). James Duddridge, the Brexit minister, has just told MPs in the Commons that the EU will get formal proposals from the UK for an alternative to the backstop before the end of the week. At the Tory conference there is an expectation that the plans will be submitted to the EU tomorrow. From Channel 4 News\u2019 Jon Snow In the Commons James Duddridge, a Brexit minister, is responding to an urgent question about the Irish border and the RT\u00c9 leak about the government\u2019s plans. He said the RT\u00c9 story was not true. Responding to the UQ, which was tabled by Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Commons Brexit committee, Duddridge said: There is no intention to have physical checks at the border. I\u2019m not choosing my words carefully there \u2013 there are no plans to do that, I can reassure him. I do know he was perhaps thinking about the reports in the Northern Ireland press that were suggesting there might be checks near the border? That is not the intention, those reports simply are incorrect. As my colleague Jennifer Rankin reports, EU sources have confirmed that the RT\u00c9 report did reflect a plan set out in a \u201cnon-paper\u201d submitted to the EU by the British. The whole point about a \u201cnon-paper\u201d is that it allows a government to float an idea in negotiations without that proposal being treated as an official proposal from the body submitting it. That means it would be accurate for a journalist to describe one of these as a proposition put forward by the government - but also accurate for the government to say this was not an official proposal. This might help to explain why the government\u2019s attempts to rebut the RT\u00c9 story this morning have been inconsistent. At one point Boris Johnson suggested the report applied to a proposal that was out-of-date. (See 8.09am.) At another point he said the report, or at least its reference to a string of border posts away from the actual border, was just wrong. (See 11.13am.) Boris Johnson\u2019s hopes of entering into intensive Brexit negotiations next week are likely to be dashed after his backing for a customs border on the island of Ireland was criticised in Berlin as being a green light for the return of a hard border, my colleagues Daniel Boffery and Jennifer Rankin report. This morning Boris Johnson criticised his Labour successor as London mayor, Sadiq Khan, for spending too much money on press officers. But, according to the Mirror, Johnson\u2019s own spending on PR was higher. Newsnight\u2019s Nicholas Watt has written a good blogpost about Boris Johnson\u2019s plans for an alternative to the backstop. He is not optimistic about a deal. Here\u2019s an extract. EU sources are withering about the UK proposals. One told me: \u201cTheir [the UK] idea for customs land checks are no different from what would happen in no deal.\u201d The source sees little chance of a deal on the basis of the proposals floated by Mr Johnson\u2019s most senior EU adviser, David Frost. \u201cWe have been told by people we take seriously that Boris Johnson wants a deal,\u201d the source told me. \u201cBut we do not see how a deal can be done.\u201d Sajid Javid, the chancellor, has been taking Treasury questions in parliament this morning. The Commons is sitting, of course, because the normal conference recess was cancelled after the government lost a vote last week. In response to a question from the Tory MP Philip Hollobone, Javid said the UK would no longer owe the EU \u00a339bn if it left without a deal. Hollobone asked for an assurance that the UK would be able to keep the money in a no-deal situation. And Javid replied: The \u00a339bn is based on a deal. If there is no deal and we end up leaving with no deal that 39bn number is no longer relevant. Javid may be right to say the exact \u00a339bn figure (a UK government assessment of how much it would pay under the complicated formula in the withdrawal agreement) would not be relevant under a no-deal Brexit. But government officials believe much or most of this money would still have to be paid, because the financial obligations would still be outstanding. The Labour MP Helen Hayes asked Javid if he was confident that hedge funds shorting the pound, \u201csome of which have donated to the prime minister\u2019s leadership campaign and to the Conservative party, have no inside information about the planning or timing of a no-deal Brexit\u201d. Javid replied: That really is such a ridiculous suggestion and it doesn\u2019t deserve an answer. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, has said that some of the 21 Tories who lost the whip after rebelling over Brexit last month could be readmitted to the parliamentary party. In an interview for Moggcast, his ConservativeHome podcast, he said: I always believe in politics in being as generous as you possibly can be. But you cannot have a situation where people are trying to put Jeremy Corbyn in charge of the order paper. So, look, if they are willing to show that they are willing to support a Conservative government deliver a Conservative programme, and pull back from what they did before, I think generosity is in the nature of conservatism, and the Conservative party is a broad church and needs to remain a broad church ... So how do we get on from here? Well, let\u2019s see if there are any other votes which give them the chance to come back, but I think a number of them are retiring and have no interest in coming back, so it won\u2019t be everybody. He also said there was no obvious way in which the government would be able to get around the Benn Act, which is designed to rule out a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. Asked about potential flaws in the legislation, he replied: The law is the law as it is. There is the very important question of how it interacts with EU law, but there is no easy and obvious loophole that I can sit here and tell you we can use, because if there is I haven\u2019t spotted it. This morning\u2019s conference business - including a session on communities, with contributions from Tory metro mayors Andy Street and Ben Houchen, and Iain Dale in conversation with Lord Dobbs - has not been much of a crowd puller. A man has been detained by police after pouring a flammable liquid over himself near the Houses of Parliament, the Press Association reports. The incident unfolded at around 10.45am and the Metropolitan police said the man was being assessed. The London Ambulance Service also attended. The Tory MP Huw Merriman posted this on Twitter. Ian Blackford, the Scottish National party\u2019s leader at Westminster, has said the leaked border plans show Boris Johnson is not serious about getting a Brexit deal. In a statement he said: Boris Johnson\u2019s leaked proposals show the Tory leader is not serious about getting a deal - and is aiming to take Scotland and the UK off a no-deal Brexit cliff. For all the bluster, the proposals just aren\u2019t credible. By fixating on its extreme Brexit obsession, the Tory government is recklessly putting the Good Friday agreement at risk - and would inflict lasting harm on jobs, living standards, public services and the economy across the UK. Here is more on exactly what Boris Johnson said this morning about potential customs arrangements in Northern Ireland. (See 9.52am.) On the Today programme Nick Robinson said the RT\u00c9 leak suggested there would be a string of border posts, not on the Irish border, but not far away. Asked if that was untrue, Johnson replied: Yes. That\u2019s not what we are proposing at all. Johnson said he did not want to discuss his proposals until they had been shared properly with the EU. But he said he was not talking about a \u201chard border\u201d just a few miles away from the actual border. He said: There are very good reasons why that would not be a good idea. I think everybody familiar with the situation in Ireland can understand why, both for practical reasons and for reasons of sentiment that we totally, totally understand. Robinson said that some in Ireland, like Sinn F\u00e9in (see 10.29am), thought there should be no checks at all on the island of Ireland. But other people argued that there would have to be checks somewhere if the UK was going to be in a separate economic arrangement. What did Johnson think? He replied: Well, I\u2019m with the second group because that\u2019s just the reality. And I think what we are coming up to now is, as it were, the critical moment of choice for us as friends and partners about how we proceed. Because in the end a sovereign, united country must have a single customs territory. And when the UK withdraws from the EU that must be the state of affairs that we have. But there are plenty of ways we can facilitate north/south trade, plenty of ways in which we can address the problem. Here are tweets from three Brussels experts on the leaked UK plan for customs sites away from the border in Northern Ireland revealed by RT\u00c9 last night. Of course, Boris Johnson has dismissed the report \u2013 although he has said it is a \u201creality\u201d that some customs checks will be needed. (See 9.52am.) From Raoul Ruparel, a former adviser on EU policy to Theresa May Peter Foster, the Telegraph\u2019s Europe editor, has posted a Twitter thread starting here. And it ends with this. From Mujtaba Rahman, a former European commission official and the Brexit specialist for the Eurasia consultancy Mary Lou McDonald, the Sinn F\u00e9in president, told the BBC this morning that the plans for customs sites away from the border - leaked to RT\u00c9 but subsequently dismissed by Boris Johnson as not reflecting the government\u2019s current thinking - would amount to a return of a hard border. She said a plan like this would be unacceptable to Sinn F\u00e9in. She explained: What has been described in this document is essentially a hard border on the island of Ireland. Anything that causes there to be customs, tariffs, checks anywhere represents a hardening of the border ... Boris Johnson voted for the backstop because in a moment of perhaps rare lucidity he recognised that was the bottom line to protect the island of Ireland. I only hope he returns to that position. Here are the main points from Boris Johnson\u2019s three broadcast interviews this morning. Johnson played down the row generated by the leak of UK plans for customs clearance sites in Northern Ireland and Ireland, away from the border, by saying these particular proposals were out-of-date. (See 8.09am.) He said there were \u201cvery good reasons\u201d why it would not be a good idea just to move border checks away from the border. But he said it was a \u201creality\u201d that some checks would be needed to create a \u201csingle customs territory\u201d for the UK once it leaves the EU. Johnson would not say exactly what the UK was proposing as an alternative to the backstop, but he said the plans would be presented to the EU very soon. He implied that he might know by the weekend whether or not a deal with the EU will be achievable. He was asked about a story saying this in the Financial Times (paywall). It says: Mr Johnson\u2019s allies say they expect Britain to submit to Brussels its formal proposals for a Brexit deal \u2014 in legal text \u2014 after the prime minister closes the Conservative party conference in Manchester. In his speech to party activists, the prime minister is expected to declare the controversial \u201cIrish backstop\u201d dead, challenging the EU to accept the new British proposal or face the prospect of a disorderly no-deal Brexit. \u201cBy the end of the week everyone will know whether a deal is possible,\u201d said one ally. One cabinet minister said: \u201cIf the EU starts to leak and brief against us, that would be a very bad sign.\u201d Asked about this story, Johnson did not reject its premise. He replied: What we will be doing is giving our friends a proposal, we think it\u2019s a good proposal. Clearly, if there is no way of getting it over the line from their point of view, we will have to live with that. He said he had not asked EU countries to veto a Brexit extension. At the weekend he fuelled speculation that this was his strategy by refusing to say whether or not he had done this. Today, asked directly if he was asking EU leaders to refuse an article 50 extension, as the Times is reporting, he replied: We haven\u2019t. In truth, we have not made any such request. But Johnson did not rule out making such a request in future. He implied that the EU would regret keeping the UK in. Asked directly if the UK was threatening to cause trouble if forced to remain a member, he did not reject the idea, and said the EU was doing things that were not in the interests of the UK. (See 8.21am.) He claimed that misconduct allegations against him were being raised now as part of a bid to frustrate Brexit. Asked about the Jennifer Arcuri and Charlotte Edwardes allegations, and why they were surfacing now, he replied: I think there\u2019s a very good reason, and that is that I\u2019ve been tasked one way or the other to get Brexit done by October 31. And there are quite a lot of well-meaning and highly intelligent people who basically think that that would be something they don\u2019t want to see, and I think that there is a concerted effort now to frustrate Brexit. At another point he said: You asked me about why is all this shot and shell raining down on the government \u2013 I think it is because we\u2019re going to get on and deliver Brexit by October 31. He claimed Sadiq Khan, the current Labour mayor of London, was involved in keeping the Arcuri story in the news. He said it was \u201cvery sad\u201d that Charlotte Edwardes had accused him of groping her at a lunch 20 years ago. Commenting on her allegations, he said: I\u2019ve said what I\u2019ve said about that. They are not true. It\u2019s obviously very sad that someone should make such allegations - they are not true. He rejected claims he had a \u201cwomen problem\u201d, claiming that he had been \u201ca big champion of women\u201d as London mayor and as foreign secretary. He said he had never heard of the BBC presenter Naga Munchetty, who has been at the centre of major row over complaints that her comment about Donald Trump using racist language breached editorial guidelines. This story has been headline news, on the BBC and elsewhere, for days. But when Johnson was asked if he thought Munchetty had done anything wrong, he replied: I am so sorry, I have never heard of her. When the LBC presenter Nick Ferrari expressed astonishment at this, Johnson went on: You\u2019re going to have to forgive me. I should know about Naga Munchetty. He described a claim by his sister Rachel that he was being influenced by hedge fund donors who stood to gain millions from a no-deal Brexit as \u201cabsolute nonsense\u201d. He revived suggestions that the MPs who drafted the Benn Act designed to stop a no-deal Brexit on 31 October may have had foreign help. Asked about the decision by unnamed No 10 sources to accuse them of \u201ccollusion\u201d, he said: I think there is a legitimate question to be asked about the generation of this SO24 legislation. It is a very interesting situation. We have bills and an act - the so-called surrender act - that I\u2019m afraid has a massive consequence for the people and economy of this country were it to be effected. We have no knowledge of how it was produced. It is not subject to normal parliamentary scrutiny. No one knows by whose advice or legal advice it was drawn up. He claimed he was still the \u201cgenerous-hearted ... one nation Tory\u201d he was when he was London mayor. When it was put to him that many of his previous supporters were alarmed at how he seemed to have changed as a politician since becoming PM, he replied: I say to all those who wish to see a return of the old generous-hearted, loving mayor of London and all the rest of it, that person has not gone away. I am a one nation Tory. But we are in a position where the only way we can take this country forward and unite our country again is to get Brexit done. That\u2019s what we need to do. He said he was a \u201cbus fanatic\u201d. From the Times\u2019s Matt Chorley Here is Boris Johnson on the set of Today. Q: Do you regret any of the language you have used? Johnson says he has to recognise that people can take offence. Q: Has your partner, Carrie Symonds, suggested you tone it down a bit? No, says Johnson. He says he persists in thinking the surrender act is an appropriate term for the Benn Act. It gives the EU the power to decide how long the UK would stay in the EU. (Actually, it doesn\u2019t. See here, the second bullet point.) And that\u2019s it. I will post a summary of the key points from all these interviews shortly. Johnson is now back to buses, saying they can make a huge difference to people\u2019s lives. He wants people to be able to use contactless payments on buses across the UK. Ferrari quotes some comments from David Cameron\u2019s book about Johnson: \u201cparanoid ... massive irritation ... full of jealousies that influenced his behaviour.\u201d Johnson says he has had his up and downs in his relationship with Cameron. He says he has not read Cameron\u2019s book. Q: Did you tell David Cameron that Brexit would be crushed like a toad? Johnson says he won\u2019t comment on private conversations. Q: So it is true. Q: What was your relationship with Jennifer Arcuri? Johnson claims this story is being pushed by the current mayor of London, Sadiq Khan. He says Khan has let knife crime out of control. Q: Did you behave improperly with Charlotte Edwardes? No, says Johnson. Q: Matt Hancock says he believes Edwardes. What do you say about that? Johnson says he is saying what he has to say. Q: Why are these stories coming out? Johnson says some intelligent people want to block Brexit. There is a \u201cconcerted effort\u201d to stop it happening, he says. Johnson suggests misconduct allegations against him are being raised as part of an effort to block Brexit. Q: Are you saying these allegations are politically motivated? Johnson says he is getting a lot of \u201cshot and shell\u201d because he is trying to deliver Brexit. And it may be an attempt to distract from his domestic agenda, he says. Q: Your sister says you are backed by currency speculators who will benefit from a no-deal Brexit. Johnson says that claim is wrong. But he does not want to say more about his sister. Johnson says he does not know who Naga Munchetty is, or what the story about her being reprimanded by the BBC was all about. Q: Have you apologised to the Queen for the unlawful prorogation? Johnson says it would be wrong for him to comment on his conversations with the Queen. Q; Will you prorogue parliament again? Johnson says, to have a Queen\u2019s speech, it is necessary to prorogue. He says he will have to check the judgment to see what is possible, but he thinks prorogation is possible. He says there will be a Queen\u2019s speech. Johnson says Queen\u2019s speech will go ahead. Nick Ferrari is now interviewing Boris Johnson on LBC. Q: Are you likely to die in a ditch? I hope not, says Johnson. He says he wants to get Brexit done. Q: The FT says by the weekend you will know if the EU are going to accept your deal. Johnson accepts that. But he says he hopes the EU will see some merit in the UK plan when they see it shortly. Johnson accepts that it will be clear within days whether or not a deal is possible. Q: Have you got a women problem? Johnson says he has always been a champion of women in every organisation he has run - like City Hall and the Foreign Office. As foreign secretary, he promoted education for girls. Q: What are you saying about the Charlotte Edwardes\u2019 allegation? Johnson says he is not minimising the importance of matters like this. But this allegation is not true, he says. Q: People who used to admire you think you have changed. Are you going to carry on like this? Johnson says, the way he sees it, he has been tasked by the British people with delivering Brexit. It is a difficult job. Many people want to prevent this. But it has to be done. All those who want to see the return of the old, generous-hearted mayor of London - that person has not gone away. He is a one nation Conservative, he says. But he says the only way to unite the country is to get Brexit done. Johnson claims he remains at heart the \u201cgenerous-hearted\u201d Tory he was when he was mayor of London. And that\u2019s it. The interview is over. Johnson makes the point about being a \u201cbus fanatic\u201d. Q: During the referendum you admitted that a no-deal Brexit would hit the economy. The OBR says it will be \u00a330bn a year. So you won\u2019t be able to afford this hospital building programme. Johnson says the money is there. In 10 years\u2019 time there will be 40 new hospitals. Q; But you are just releasing \u00a3100m for these now. The money won\u2019t be there if there is a no-deal Brexit. Johnson says the money is there. Johnson claims a no-deal Brexit would not derail his planned hospital building programme. Q: How did you feel when your sister Rachel criticised the language you used about your critics? Johnson says disagrees with some family members on Brexit. Q: This is not about Brexit. This is about your language. Number 10 has accused your critics of \u201cforeign collusion\u201d. Johnson says it is worth asking how that \u201csurrender act\u201d came about. We have no knowledge of how that bill was produced. It was not subject to normal parliamentary processes. Q: So it may be produced by foreign government? Johnson says he personally has not used the word \u201ccollaborators\u201d. Q: You said collaborating. Johnson says there are different connotations to different words. He says no one knows how this bill was produced. Johnson says staying in would cost \u00a31bn a month. Robinson says that figure is disputed - like his \u00a3350m a week figure on the Vote Leave bus. Johnson says that figure would be higher now. Q: Are you asking EU leaders to rule out a Brexit extension? Johnson says he has not made any such request. But he says he thinks EU leaders do want this sorted. Q: You told Andrew Marr that the EU would not want the UK to stay as a \u201ctruculent\u201d member. Are you threatening bad behaviour if we stay? Johnson says people want to leave. He says he does not think any purpose is achieved by keeping the UK in against its will. Q: Dominic Raab says we won\u2019t \u201cplay nice\u201d if we stay. Are you threatening to muck things up if kept in? Johnson says the EU is doing things that are not in the interests of the UK. Q: So you will veto things they want? Johnson says the EU see the UK as a great power. We have spent three years arguing about leaving. They want to see us leaving, and a positive relationship with us. He goes on: I am a pro-European. I actually love Europe. Q: There are people who say you don\u2019t want a deal. And look where your money comes from. Your donors do not want a deal? Johnson says this is the inverse of reality. He wants a deal. But there are limits. There is a limit to how much a sovereign country can compromise on customs. On sanitary and phytosanitary plans for Ireland, he has already moved \u201ca long way\u201d. He says he does not think people in the UK have recognised quite how much the UK has moved on this. Johnson claims UK has already compromised more on backstop than people realise. Nick Robinson is interviewing Boris Johnson on Today. Q: Will you be ringing EU leaders today about your plans? Johnson says he has been making calls. He has seen some leaked plans, possibly leaked by Brussels, that are not quite right. Q: So the report about having customs clearances sites away from the border are not true? Johnson says that is correct. It would not make sense to have a new border away from the border. Q: But people say there have to be checks somewhere? Johnson says he accepts that. He says the UK is coming up to the point of decision. A single, united country must have its own customs territory. But there are lots of ways of doing this. There are ways of protecting the customs area. Robinson says Johnson can come back and discuss his plans when they are published. Johnson does not reject the idea. This is what Boris Johnson told BBC Breakfast about the plan for customs clearance sites away from the Northern Ireland border leaked to RTE. As far as I can make out from what I have seen of the response from Brussels and, I think, Dublin, they are not talking about the proposals that we are actually going to be tabling. They are talking about some stuff that went in previously ... We\u2019ve made a very good offer, we are going to make a very good offer, we will be tabling it formally very soon. Q: Did you expect this level of scrutiny? Have you enjoyed the job? Johnson says it is a wonderful job. He is motivated by the desire to tackle things like low pay. The national living wage is going up. The living wage is a fantastic thing, he says. And he says it works for employers because their staff are better motivated. He says he does not want to minimise things like sexual misconduct (my terms, not his). But in this case the allegations are not true. He says he loves buses. He is a \u201cbus fanatic\u201d. He says, if you put contactless payment on buses, you will get more cars off the road. And that\u2019s it. Q: Do people trust you? Look at what we do, he says. He says he stood on the steps of Number 10 and promised more police officers and new hospitals. Those officer are being recruited, and he has published plans for 40 new hospitals, he says. Q: You don\u2019t talk about your private life. Johnson says he intends to continue with that. Q: But what do you say about Charlotte Edwardes? Johnson says this is a difficult time. A lot of people don\u2019t want Brexit to be done. They see Johnson as the person delivering it. So it is inevitable he will come in for a lot of \u201cshot and shell\u201d. He says the Edwardes\u2019 allegations are \u201cnot true\u201d. It is \u201cvery sad\u201d that she has made them, she says. Q: Is that behaviour inappropriate? It is not true, says Johnson. Q: But would it be inappropriate? Yes, of course, says Johnson. Johnson says it is \u201cvery sad\u201d that the journalist Charlotte Edwardes has made groping allegations against him that are \u201cnot true\u201d. Johnson says the most important thing is to \u201cbust out\u201d of the backstop arrangements. Under the backstop, the UK would have to accept EU laws, he says. He says he wants to exploit \u201cthe freedoms that are so vital for Brexit\u201d. And he thinks this can be done in a way that protects the Good Friday agreement, he says. Q: What else will you change about the withdrawal agreement? Will it just be Theresa May\u2019s deal without the backstop? Johnson says getting rid of the backstop is the main goal. But he wants changes to the political declaration too. He says getting rid of the backstop will allow the UK to have an exciting relationship with the EU and the rest of the world. There is no point in leaving the EU if you stay in the customs union, bound by EU trade policy. Johnson says the UK has agreed that there should be an all-island area in Ireland for agri-foods. This would mean Northern Ireland being bound by EU sanitary and phytosanitary rules. That is a big concession from the UK, he says. Dan Walker is interviewing Boris Johnson on BBC Breakfast. Q: What are the backstop changes you are planning? Johnson says the EU and Dublin are not talking about the UK government\u2019s final plans. They are talking about \u201csome stuff\u201d that was proposed earlier. He says the UK will make a \u201cvery good offer\u201d. It will table it soon. To be a country, you need a single border. Q: So are you going to have customs sites as described? No, says Johnson. Q: So what are you planning? Johnson says he does not want to say now. Plans can get distorted. Here are the Boris Johnson interviews coming up. 7.45am - BBC Breakfast 8.10am - Today programme 8.30am - LBC Boris Johnson is doing a round of media interviews this morning, and he is bound to be asked about an important Brexit story that broke last night. The UK government is due to present the EU with detailed plans for a replacement to the backstop within days and last night the Irish broadcaster RTE published a leak of plans, saying the UK wants to have customs clearance sites in Ireland, five to 10 miles away from the border to the north and the south. The Irish government has called the plans a \u201cnon-starter\u201d. Here is my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll\u2019s overnight story about the leak of the plans. And here is how Lisa\u2019s story starts. Boris Johnson\u2019s secret plans to solve the Irish border Brexit challenge involve customs sites on both sides of the border and real-time tracking devices on lorries, it has been reported. The ideas, which mark a departure from his promise not to put infrastructure on the border, are part of four unofficial papers submitted by the UK to Brussels by Johnson\u2019s team. The broadcaster RT\u00c9, which has had sight of the the tightly guarded proposals, is reporting that customs clearance sites would be sited five to 10 miles from the border to the north and the south to deal with imports and exports. Traders would have the choice of lodging their papers at these sites, similar to the ones that existed before the single market came into existence, or electing to be tracked electronically in an online \u201ctransit\u201d arrangement. Here is Tony Connelly\u2019s full RTE story on the leaked plans. Simon Coveney, the Irish foreign minister and deputy prime minister, has rejected the proposals. Robert Buckland, the justice secretary, has said the plans leaked to RTE are just \u201cpreliminary documents\u201d. Here is the agenda for the day. 10am: The conference opens with a session on stronger communities, followed by a session celebrating \u201cthe Conservative party in action\u201d, hosted by Lord Dobbs and Iain Dale. 2pm: A session on social justice in action. 2.45pm: Shaun Bailey, the Tory mayoral candidate for London, speaks. 3pm: Session on criminal justice, with speeches from Robert Buckland, the justice secretary, Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, and 3.45pm: Priti Patel, the home secretary speaks. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will be focusing almost exclusively on the Conservative conference. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "bodyText": "Frank Lampard has said that Ross Barkley was naive to go on a night out in the buildup to a Champions League game after the Chelsea midfielder was involved in an argument with a taxi driver in Liverpool on Sunday. Barkley has travelled to Lille for Wednesday\u2019s Group H game but Lampard feels it was unprofessional of the England international to be out three days before a match in which Chelsea need to respond to opening their European campaign with a home defeat by Valencia. The 25-year-old admitted he made a mistake when he spoke to Chelsea\u2019s manager on Tuesday morning. Reports claimed that Barkley was escorted to a cash machine by two police officers after spilling chips in a taxi and refusing to give the driver money for the mess. \u201cI don\u2019t have to give permission on a day off to be in Liverpool,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a problem.

Tau dashed through the middle yet again but did not see the option to pass opening up and was eventually bundled over.

Bonaventure was withdrawn; Brugge\u2019s fans applauded and Madrid\u2019s probably felt like doing the same, relieved to see him go. The impetus went too, that fury momentarily fizzing out. Vin\u00edcius ran but few real chances followed. There were 27 shots from the home side, but not the danger that number suggests. Then a challenge from Vormer, diving in, caught Vin\u00edcius on the ankle. Georgi Kabakov sent Vormer off and from the free-kick Casemiro headed Madrid level. They had six minutes to get another. When Ramos jumped with Mignolet and the ball ran free in the six-yard box, there was a sharp intake of breath, and it felt inevitable that Madrid would score. But they didn\u2019t and in fact, it was Brugge who came closest in those dying minutes. Tau dashed through the middle yet again but did not see the option to pass opening up and was eventually bundled over. From the free-kick, deep into stoppage time, Siebe Schrijvers was suddenly alone deep inside the Madrid area. He had barely been on the pitch a few seconds and he sliced his shot wide.",

Steele tweeted a slapstick video of a woman trying to sweep sand into the ocean as the tide rolled in. He was lampooning something noted by veterans of the last impeachment fight, targeting Bill Clinton, and others. One week after the Democrats opened their official inquiry, the president and his party are still improvising a defense and have yet to hit on a coherent response. \u201cIt\u2019s as if the Trump campaign has read the Clinton playbook and at every turn opted for the opposite,\u201d said David Frum, a conservative columnist in the 1990s who was later a speechwriter for George W Bush, writing in the Atlantic. Where Clinton tried to appeal to voters in the middle and stay focused on policy, counting on impeachment to blow over, Frum wrote, Trump is \u201cwholly obsessed with impeachment \u2026 raving nonstop against the whistleblower, the House, and all his political foes \u2013 seen and unseen.\u201d In the week since the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, announced impeachment proceedings, Trump has vowed to unveil the whistleblower, in defiance of federal protections; accused a Democratic committee chair of treason; quoted a prediction that impeachment would touch off civil war; elevated a false story about a supposed change to whistleblower laws; and generally asked people to believe him instead of their own eyes. \u201cAlmost everything [the whistleblower] has said about my \u2018perfect\u2019 call with the Ukrainian president is wrong,\u201d Trump tweeted on Tuesday. In fact, the whistleblower\u2019s description of the call, which you can read here, matches a summary of the call released by the White House, which you can read here, and those accounts both match Trump\u2019s own summary of his communications with Ukraine. If there is a point on which Trump and Republicans contend that the whistleblower complaint is wrong on the facts, they have yet to identify it. \u201cThe only defenses we\u2019ve heard from Trump on the Ukraine call so far are false assertions that the whistleblower had no first-hand knowledge and that the [whistleblower] form changed,\u201d tweeted the former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti. \u201cThat\u2019s because the transcript, on its face, establishes the offense and there\u2019s no good excuse for it.\u201d Defenses of the president floated by Republicans have been no less scattered than those floated by Trump himself. After a disastrous 60 Minutes appearance in which he exposed his ignorance of the White House call summary, the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, unveiled a wan numbered list of \u201cthe most important facts we have\u201d. Among them: \u201cThe president did nothing that would be impeachable.\u201d The minority whip, Steve Scalise, took a different tack, arguing that the impeachment inquiry was \u201cbased on false rumors [and] leftwing rage\u201d stoked by \u201cradicals [and] socialists\u201d who \u201chave taken over the Democrat [sic] Party\u201d. But that line of messaging \u2013 that, in short, the Democrats have lost their minds \u2013 was undercut by other Republican voices who acknowledged the validity of the whistleblower complaint. Chuck Grassley, the longest-serving Republican in the Senate, released a statement on Tuesday defending the whistleblower. \u201cThis person appears to have followed the whistleblower protection laws and ought to be heard out and protected,\u201d the Iowan said. \u201cNo one should be making judgments or pronouncements without hearing from the whistleblower first and carefully following up on the facts.\u201d The success of Trump\u2019s messaging strategy does not depend on coherence or convincing the pundits. Ultimately the only important audience for him is the voters. But the early numbers on that front are not encouraging for the administration. In a CNBC poll released on Tuesday morning, Trump\u2019s approval rating had dropped to an all-time low of 37% \u2013 although it had not changed in polling averages. Clinton emerged from impeachment with buoyed poll numbers and his top Republican assailants were swept from office in the next election. First on the list of those swept aside was Newt Gingrich, who lost the House speakership, having led the charge to impeach Clinton for making false statements to investigators about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. At the time, it later emerged, Gingrich was conducting an extramarital affair of his own, with a congressional staffer. Gingrich said on Fox News on Tuesday it was outrageous for Democrats to investigate Trump for allegedly abusing the power of his office and undermining national security and election integrity by soliciting a foreign country for help in the upcoming election. \u201cThis is, in constitutional terms, a coup d\u2019etat,\u201d Gingrich said. \u201cIt is an effort by one branch of the government to destroy the incumbent president of the United States without any regard for the facts.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>A story inspired by a brief dictionary entry about an 18th-century woman described as a \u201cvoluble hypocrite\u201d has won Jo Lloyd the \u00a315,000 BBC national short story award.</p> <p>In The Invisible, Martha, who claims she is friends with an invisible family, is living in an invisible mansion in Carnarvonshire. It opens: \u201cMr Ingram and his Invisible daughter Miss Ingram live close by, Martha tells us, in a grand, impractical mansion of the type the wealthy favour \u2013 except Invisible, of course \u2013 made from dressed stone the colour of spring cream, with a slate roof and glass in every window.\u201d</p> <p>The Welsh writer discovered Martha\u2019s history by chance, when looking through the online Dictionary of Welsh Biography. The dictionary says Martha \u201csucceeded in persuading many people of that neighbourhood\u201d of her stories \u2013 although eventually doubts began to spread.</p> <p>Chair of the judges and BBC broadcaster Nikki Bedi said thedecision had been unanimous. Five authors had been shortlisted: Lloyd, Lucy Caldwell, Lynda Clark, Jacqueline Crooks and Tamsin Grey.</p> <p>\u201cThe story is unplaceable but deeply resonant. The Invisible\u2019s themes touch on wealth and class, what can be seen and not seen, and what\u2019s precious and what should be valued in the world. You will read and reread it, and be richer every time,\u201d Bedi said. </p> <p>Her fellow judge and the winner of the 2017 prize, Cynan Jones, said Lloyd had painted \u201ca timelessly relevant picture of how we obsess for access to worlds we cannot have\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt is,\u201d he said, \u201calso a story about story itself; our need for them, to allow us to see beyond ourselves, and how the stories we buy into can bring us together or push us apart.\u201d </p> <p>Lloyd, who grew up in south Wales, received her award at a ceremony broadcast live on Radio 4 on Tuesday night.</p> <h2><strong>The Invisible by Jo Lloyd</strong></h2> <p><em><strong>Across the lake</strong></em></p> <p>Mr Ingram and his Invisible daughter Miss Ingram live close by, Martha tells us, in a grand, impractical mansion of the type the wealthy favour \u2013 except Invisible, of course \u2013 made from dressed stone the colour of spring cream, with a slate roof and glass in every window.</p> <p>Is that so, we say.</p> <p>They receive numerous Invisible guests, Martha tells us, who must travel here from other Invisible mansions, in other parts of the country.</p> <p>That would follow, we say.</p> <p>They attend fairs and sales about the district. They are regulars at our Wednesday markets.</p> <p>To sell or to buy?</p> <p>They are Invisible!</p> <p>To accomplish trade both parties must be visible, a fact we have not previously had cause to contemplate.</p> <p>Mr Ingram\u2019s mansion, Martha tells us, stands on the other side of the lake, at the foot of the mountain. We have inspected the spot she indicates and confirmed it is in no way remarkable. Cold eels of water slide among rushes and sedges and tumps of starry moss. Cat-gorse and furze cling to rafts of drier ground. Spearwort and flag dip their toes and shiver.</p> <p>Not that we need to search for evidence. If there were a mansion across the lake, our dogs would be howling every time an Ingram passed by. Our daughters would be scouring their pots, our sons sweating in their stables and gardens.</p> <p>Some accuse Martha of fraud, although what she has to gain by it we cannot determine.</p> <p>Others say her wits are failing. We\u2019ve known her put her clothes on back to front and summon her cow with the call meant for hogs. She will stop for minutes on end to watch rooks or lapwings tumble about the sky, as if they bore porridge and dates and the answers to life\u2019s mysteries in their beaks.</p> <p>But most are happy, eager even, to take her at her word. We want to believe that the Invisible have, for whatever purpose, established their Invisible home next to us. It pleases us to imagine them prodding the fat rumps of our livestock, testing our grains with their clean Invisible fingernails.</p> <p>Tell us more, we say, and Martha dimples like a girl.</p> <p>There are many of them, she says. Sometimes the Invisible outnumber other visitors.</p> <p>But why do they come to market?</p> <p>For amusement, I suppose. Entertainment.</p> <p>We look each other up and down, wondering which of us is most entertaining.</p> <p>The Ingrams have called at Martha\u2019s cottage, of an evening, to pay their respects.</p> <p>Miss Ingram has such pale hands, Martha says. As if she keeps them folded away in a linen chest.</p> <p>What language do they speak?</p> <p>It is English, I presume. I seem to understand some of it. But their speech is strange. Until you are very close, it\u2019s like a noise of leaves or water.</p> <p>We cannot think why, of all of us, they would choose Martha. She is not the most educated or wise. Not even the most gullible.</p> <p>Invite us along next time they visit, says Jacob. That should sort the wheat from the goats.</p> <p>They wouldn\u2019t allow it, Martha says.</p> <p>What are you afraid of? Jacob says. Let\u2019s settle this once and for all.</p> <p>Come on Martha, we say. Let\u2019s settle this. Unless you have reason to be afraid.</p> <p>I would love to see Miss Ingram\u2019s dress, says Eliza. And her jewellery. I would love to see how she does her hair.</p> <p>Oh yes, we say. We\u2019d love to see her dress and her hair and her jewellery.</p> <p>It\u2019s out of the question, Martha keeps saying. They would never agree.</p> <p>But if there is one thing we know, it is persistence.<br></p> <p><em><strong>Freckled peas</strong></em></p> <p>The Vestry can find no regulations that apply. In the past, Martha might have been suspected of contracting with demons, but the Parliament in London has repealed the law against witchcraft. We don\u2019t know if this is because we\u2019ve progressed beyond such superstition or because all the witches have been drowned.</p> <p>Martha has never been known as a fool or a liar. Once she claimed to have seen a yellow cat the size of a two-tooth hogget at her door, but perhaps she did, and if not, anyone could make that mistake. Jacob complained that she sold him a calf that was already sick and it expired within a day, but they resolved that dispute between them. Mostly she has lived the way we all do, evenly, tidily, respecting time and season. She plants oats and beans and freckled peas on her late father\u2019s holding, keeps bees and chickens, drives her cow to the grazings. She has no husband or children bringing home a wage from the quarry, but then she has no one for whom she must buy tea and sugar. She is a hard worker, if a slow one. When she was a baby her mother, Rebecca, stumbling, as we understand, let her fall in the hearth. In the moments it took the parents to react, flames bit through the swaddling, gnawed the tender infant limbs. We found Rebecca later in the church porch, hanged dead. Martha was left with a limp and, in her breath, a hiss as of hot ashes settling. But she is not one to make excuses. She salts her own bacon, gathers her own turf and bark. She has a reputation as a pickler and preserver, putting up the greater part of her harvest and whatever she collects from woods and wastes. She\u2019s able to sell her surplus to lazier households. She is careful with her animals, keeping them clean and dry. In hard winters, she stints herself to feed them.</p> <p><em><strong>Plump and handsome</strong></em></p> <p>Martha is adamant that the Invisible are not the Tylwyth Teg, who are known to be short and ill-favoured.</p> <p>The Ingrams are as tall as we are, she points out. Taller. They\u2019re plump and handsome.</p> <p>Also the Tylwyth Teg are spiteful. They bear grudges for generations. They hide robins\u2019 eggs in shoes, crumble owl pellets into the flour.</p> <p>The Invisible, Martha says, are smiling always, and if they are not smiling they are laughing. They are generous. Once I saw Miss Ingram pick up a fallen kit and place it back with its fellows.</p> <p>But on further questioning, she admits such acts of charity are rare. Mostly the Invisible keep apart, chattering among themselves.</p> <p>How do they dress?</p> <p>It is the fashion of the city, I suppose, all bright colours and embroidery. And everything always new. Not darned or frayed or even muddy. As if every day is Easter Day.</p> <p>Do any of them resemble your father? John Protheroe the smith wants to know. Or Price Price or Mother Jenkins?</p> <p>But we hush him. We don\u2019t want to think that the contents of our graveyard have got themselves up in their best clothes to trot about among us, formulating opinions.</p> <p>Martha shakes her head. They\u2019re not like anyone I\u2019ve seen before. In looks or behaviour. I believe they\u2019re different from us altogether.</p> <p><em><strong>Only child</strong></em></p> <p>Martha\u2019s limp identifies her from some distance. It is of the lurching, stiff-legged variety, like a boat hit side-on by a swell. She uses a stick, for walking only, never hitting. When a beast jibs or straggles, she chides, like a doting granny, in a voice you could mistake for praise. She combs the burs from her cow\u2019s tail. Sometimes, milking, she seems to fall asleep with her head on Pluen\u2019s flank.</p> <p>The only child of only children, since Enoch her father died, Martha has no family at all. She can breakfast at midnight if she pleases, not even trouble to prepare dinner. She has grown thinner these last years. If there were a tempest, such as our forebears talked of, strong enough to strip the thatch from our roofs and topple animals in their stalls, it might blow Martha away altogether, leaving only her shawl hooked in a blackthorn.</p> <p>Enoch wanted Martha to marry Abel Pritchard. There was a conversation and a handshake and for months Pritchard would call to smoke a pipe or play chess with Enoch. On Sundays, Pritchard would walk her to church, and a comical pairing they made, Martha bobbing in the lee of his ox plod. But in the end he found a girl younger and quicker, with a dowry worth the promise. The bitterness between Enoch and Pritchard lasted until the older man\u2019s death. We do not know what Martha thought.<br></p> <p><em><strong>The Reverends</strong></em></p> <p>The Reverend Doctor Clough-Vaughan-Bowen comes all the way from the next county to see Martha. He lodges with the Reverend Rice-Mansel-Evans and early next morning the two men pick their way through a sparkling drizzle to the door of her cottage. Doctor Clough-Vaughan-Bowen is a learned man, of good family. He has written scholarly works, we understand, on subjects of interest to the clergy \u2212 adult baptism or the wearing of the chasuble. Rumour says he had a wife who died giving birth to their dying child. Rumour shrugs. When our neighbours and families suffer such losses we take gifts of hyssop or honey to their door, weep with them beside the new graves. But it is hard to believe that men such as Doctor Clough-Vaughan-Bowen have feelings as sharp or deep as our own. Mwynig and Brithen, we remember, bellow through the night that their calves are taken, but next day turn their inquiries instead to turnips.</p> <p>The Reverend Doctor has not come to reprimand Martha, nor to interrogate her. He talks, in his educated, university English, of which she comprehends a third at most, of many invisible things. Hopes and dreams and memories. The brains of horses. The souls of the dead. The imagination. The future. The swallows sleeping snugly at the bottom of the lake.</p> <p>He talks of the visible, and the traces it leaves. The fountain that sprang up where the saint pressed his thumb into the earth. The rock pierced by the giant\u2019s spear. The stony pawprint left by Arthur\u2019s hound hunting Twrch Trwyth across the mountain tops.</p> <p>You see what I\u2019m saying? he says to Martha.</p> <p>Martha smiles and nods at moments where it seems appropriate.</p> <p>The drizzle gives way to stumps of rainbow parting a watery sky. The reverends pick their way back and Doctor Clough-Vaughan-Bowen takes his leave, apparently satisfied.<br></p> <p><em><strong>French sauce</strong></em></p> <p>Martha has pressed her nose to the windows of Mr Ingram\u2019s mansion. The Invisible dine late, she tells us, but they light neither candle nor lamp. There is no fire even, but they seem warm enough in their cambrics and silks. The ladies\u2019 throats and wrists are bare. They drink wine as red as rosehips from silver goblets. The china is blue and white, thin as a blade, and the table is laid with many dishes. They eat roast meats with French sauce, fillets and cheeks and sirloins, veal fricassey, veal ragoo, snipe, partridge, wheatears, lark livers simmered with cloves, blanched lettuce, white milk-bread, parsley and sweet herbs chopped fine, flummery and posset, clary fritters, heaped bowls of gooseberries and mulberries and quinces, sweetmeats coloured with spinach and beet and delicately fashioned into multitudinous shapes.</p> <p>But who waits at table? we want to know. Who delivers the food? Who cooks it?</p> <p>Martha has seen no Invisible footmen standing to attention, no butchers or vintners at the kitchen door. The Invisible, she insists, are all wealthy. There are no Invisible maids or carpenters or shopkeepers. The Invisible do no work.</p> <p>But how can they live without the poor to serve them? we ask.</p> <p>What about the puddings, says Eliza. Are they spiced? Do they wobble? Are they eaten hot or cold?</p> <p>There are baked puddings and boiled puddings and set puddings, says Martha. Wonderful domed and turreted puddings, like palaces. Thick with candied cherries and angelica. The custard is yellow as buttercups.</p> <p>They sit at table for hours, she tells us, but they talk more than they chew. They don\u2019t gobble their food or help it to their mouths with their fingers, hunting down any fragments that fall and cramming them back in.</p> <p>Tell us about the meats, we say. Tell us about the cream. Tell us about the apricots and persimmons, the roast swans and haunches of venison. Tell us.<br></p> <p><em><strong>Englyn</strong></em></p> <p>We are enjoying a kind of fame. In other districts the gossip is of Martha. The Ingrams are mentioned in a number of sermons. The Dissenters make it yet another opportunity to talk of ale and tithes. Owen Owen composes an englyn on the subject of the Invisible that is perhaps not up to the standard of his early and most beautiful work but we admire its wisdom and one particularly melodious alliteration and some of us learn it to recite to our families as we sit beside our hearths.</p> <p>Markets are visibly better attended and at first we are grateful. But many of the newcomers spend only time, which they use to query and argue, cast aspersions, search behind walls and under trestles, inside calf cots and pig sties.</p> <p>If anyone asks what makes us so interesting, we have no answer. We cannot explain the Invisible\u2019s curiosity. Some of us speculate it may be convenience, a matter of location. Some of us wonder if the attention is always kindly meant. Do they wrinkle their noses as they walk past us? Wave their lace handkerchiefs to clear the air? Do they avert their eyes from our misshapen bodies and pocked faces?</p> <p>Mr Ingram has a gold pocketwatch. He consults it more often than is strictly necessary for someone who has no appointments to keep.<br></p> <p><em><strong>Ribbon</strong></em></p> <p>Some of the young people \u2013 Naomi Price and Megan Prosser and their tittering friends, plus one or two lads who are sweet on them, and Mot, the Prices\u2019 brindled cattle dog \u2212 have taken to aping the behaviour of the Invisible. They practise walking in no special direction and raising their eyebrows while others labour. They affect amazement at sickles and stooks and handlooms and potherbs and piglets. The girls have acquired a silk ribbon that they pass about between them so that one or another, usually Naomi, can wear it in her hair every day. They hold their skirts out of the mud, in the manner of Miss Ingram, and fan themselves with sprays of hawthorn.</p> <p>They have developed a sudden passion for knowledge, pestering Martha with questions. She indulges them until she tires or runs out of observations and then she shooes them away like so many finches. The next day they flock back, nudging and giggling, as at their first day of dame school. Martha tuts fondly and repeats yesterday\u2019s lesson.</p> <p>We think it harmless enough until they neglect their work. Three times, John Protheroe has to fetch his boy back to the forge. There is a great deal of shouting and a coulter is spoiled. Megan judges herself too good to dip rushes, while Naomi protests that stitching or churning will roughen her hands. The Prices are accustomed to their daughter\u2019s airs, but she has corrupted the once-faithful Mot, who now slinks away from his duties at every opportunity to bury his head in Naomi\u2019s knees and sigh as she folds his pretty ears into a bow.</p> <p>The Ingrams should know better than to encourage such foolishness, we say to Martha. You should know better.</p> <p>And when some of us point out that young folk rarely need encouragement, no one listens.</p> <p>We must keep them close to home, we say.</p> <p>The dog can be tied up, but our children need another solution. We give them more chores, more responsibilities, make sure they are too tired for mischief.</p> <p>For a time, we think things back to normal. But the Protheroe boy wears a look of discontent as he works the bellows, and young Preece leans daydreaming on a shovel, next to the lime he should be spreading. As for Naomi, she has declared she will never marry. She would rather stay a spinster, she says, than grow red-cheeked and loose-waisted with a man whose favourite subject is the pigs he smells of. She can be seen rehearsing for her preferred future, strolling alone through marble halls or colonnades of pleached limes, her nose in the air and a frayed gold ribbon trailing behind.<br></p> <p><em><strong>Unnavigable</strong></em></p> <p>It is July and there has been no rain for five weeks. The summer pastures have scorched yellow, then black, as if they have combusted from within, and we bring the herds down early. The lake shrinks. Insects clump and die in its rotting margins. Springs that have never before failed run dry. When the cows complain of their multiple empty stomachs, we offer them leaves and twigs. Harvests are poor all about the district.</p> <p>The Invisible are enjoying the sun, Martha tells us. They walk out at full midday to admire unclimbable heights and horrible precipices. Their hats are large. They spread cloths on the ground before they sit. They picnic on assorted meats, potted and pastried and aspiced. They do a kind of dancing, the figures intricate and indecipherable.</p> <p>What is the music? we want to know. Who plays?</p> <p>Martha shakes her head. There are no musicians. It is in the air perhaps. They take it with them.</p> <p>Rain falls every day of September. The drops gather and hang in fleecy clouds until the commons resemble the floor of a shearing shed. The earth, muddled by these disorderly seasons, squanders her energies on green shoots that will not last the winter.</p> <p>It turns hot again. Haf bach Mihangel. The sunsets are bronze, the dawns like unripe strawberries. The new quarry drops its prices. There is an accident in which two men die and one loses the use of his arm.</p> <p>The Invisible are busy at their sports and pastimes. Not throwing or sparring or chasing a leather ball. Games with mysterious rules and objectives. Mr Ingram covers his eyes and the others circle around him, calling and pointing. Miss Ingram gestures like a bird, or an old woman, and they all laugh. They tilt and balance and yaw and hop and fall. There is no winner. Or they are all winners. It is hard to tell.</p> <p>November. The storms beat at our walls, howling accusations. When the winds drop, the bone chill starts. We count the jars, measure what\u2019s left in barrels and sacks. Every creak is a stranger creeping through the darkness with intent. December. We muffle our noses, warm our hands in our armpits. At night we hug our husbands and children close to steal their heat. The salted meat is used, the pickles and dried fruit gone. We boil hide to make broth. January. February. Those with a cow are drinking milk and praying the hay will last. Those without are living on husks and air. The Prossers have sold their bedding and only a blanket donated by the Reverend keeps their youngest from perishing.</p> <p>The Ingrams must look across the lake, see our cottages dimly lit, some without smoke even. Do they imagine us huddled inside, stupid with cold, our fingers white?</p> <p>In the second half of March, there is a run of dewy bright mornings. The milfyw flowers, and we put the cattle out to graze. They skip and buck like the ogre\u2019s darling children, dip their heads to the celandines to admire their bristled chins. A soft breeze strokes our hair and we hold our faces to the sun. The frogs croak all night. The sparrows get busy in our roofs and we in our beds.</p> <p>But one afternoon the sky is spotted with peewits and golden plovers, fieldfares and redwings. They wheel above us, calling their alarm, then the snow they are fleeing arrives. It is the heaviest fall in ten years, heaping against walls, holding our doors closed. By morning, earth and air are so white that half a mile from us a new shore seems to have formed, before a strange, unnavigable sea. It is days before we can drive our animals to pasture, and when we do, bird corpses litter the ground, too many even for the foxes, and the grass is stewed.</p> <p>When Martha limps into view we forget to ask how she is managing and instead inquire after the Invisible. How do they like the winter? Do they startle when the wind jeers from their chimneys? Do their slates seal out the thaw?</p> <p>They play cards. They enjoy jugged hare and buttered peas, sugar cakes enrobed in sugar. Miss Ingram\u2019s frock is lilac, lit from within like a spring sky.</p> <p>We look at each other. We frown.</p> <p>Some propose going to the Ingrams\u2019 door to beg for work or failing that last night\u2019s bones or a measure of barley. We should get up a committee, perhaps, to remind the Ingrams of their duty to their neighbours. Some even mutter of going in force. We will don dresses and bonnets for disguise, paint our faces white, light torches.</p> <p>But some object. We don\u2019t need violence. Martha will help us. Let us be there when they visit, we say, as we have said before. Let us talk to them.</p> <p>Tell me your demands, she says. I will represent you.</p> <p>But it is not enough. We want to make our own case. We want to hear how they respond. Many of us are wiser than Martha. Many of us know more English. We will not be denied.</p> <p>The Ingrams abhor questions, she says, or importuning.</p> <p>We will be quiet. We will only speak when spoken to.</p> <p>They cannot bear any light but that of the sun and the moon.</p> <p>We are accustomed to darkness, we say.<br></p> <p><em><strong>Creaks and ventings</strong></em></p> <p>In the twilight borrowed from a clear night sky, we recognize our neighbours\u2019 heads and shoulders, their creaks and ventings, familiar from vigils and services. That is Widow Johns, that is Eliza, that is young Jenkin Jenkins, taking advantage of the situation to slide up close to Mary Probert. That is mice hurrying in the thatch. That is Pluen at the other end of the room, grumbling about a greasy trough or spiders in her hay. We yawn and sigh and stretch and fidget. We listen.</p> <p>And finally we hear something. We think we hear something. A padding that is the approach of feet softer than a cat\u2019s, feet that make no mark on the ground. A noise as of leaves or water, gradually increasing.</p> <p>Then a figure rises before us. A figure that is quite obviously, even in this dusk, Jacob, with a shawl draped over his head. He starts speaking, or piping rather, in a high-pitched voice, words that are not words in any language we know. We aren\u2019t sure what to do. Beneath his trill, an undercurrent of confusion and dismay begins.</p> <p>Come along now, that\u2019s enough of that, says Old Mr Jenkins.</p> <p>Jacob keeps on babbling and chirping. He totters in a circle, flaps a lunatic hand. Almost falls over Martha stepping forward to protest, almost saves himself, staggers again, knocks her to the floor.</p> <p>Then we are all up, talking at once, cheering and booing and baying, like a crowd at a hanging. Some help Martha, others pull the cover from Jacob\u2019s head. He is laughing. In a minute a rushlight is burning. Our faces glow red and orange, outraged, amused, disgusted, disappointed.</p> <p>So much for your Invisible, says Jacob, cackling. And some of us cackle with him. So much for lies and nonsense. So much for anyone who thinks themselves better than us.</p> <p>Martha has her face in her hands and Eliza is comforting her, turning every now and then to berate Jacob. Look what you\u2019ve done, says Eliza. And some of us join in. Look what you\u2019ve done. They will never come now.<br></p> <p><em><strong>Pullet</strong></em></p> <p>We scold Jacob until he agrees to apologise. He presents himself at Martha\u2019s cottage with a speckled pullet under his arm. She shuts the door in their faces.</p> <p>Although, in the matter of Jacob\u2019s behaviour, our sympathies lie with Martha, the incident is not unwelcome to everyone. His method was crude, we admit, but he has expressed our own misgivings.</p> <p>Others are confident that Jacob\u2019s stunt has only delayed our meeting with the Invisible. Next time, we say, we will be more particular with our invitations.</p> <p>Martha herself seems to have aged years overnight, as elderly people sometimes do, in a sudden haste to know their end. She will not discuss the abortive visit, nor will she deliver fresh news. Tell us what the Ingrams are up to, we say. Have there been parties or excursions? A masked ball perhaps? But she will say nothing.</p> <p>For a time, we make do with other topics. White peas reach double the price of wheat. Sucking pigs are 15s a head. John Johns and Ruth Prosser break their engagement and a month later mend it. Rachel Protheroe gives birth to twins. The hay is affected by mildew. In the next parish, we hear, a cow is struck by lightning and her calf bleaches white, not a shred of colour left in it. That, we think, is something Miss Ingram might wish to see. But when we say this to Martha, she turns her back.</p> <p>Some point to Martha\u2019s silence as evidence of deceit. Others defend her.</p> <p>It is shameful, we say, to treat an old woman with so little respect.</p> <p>There must be respect on both sides, we respond.</p> <p>We\u2019d sooner listen to Martha than to mischief-makers, we say.</p> <p>Fools are the best audience for foolery, we reply.</p> <p>Rancour and rebuke creep among us like fleas. Friends fall out. Families almost come to blows. Some of us declare ourselves fed up with the whole business and ready to agree with anyone who will leave us in peace.</p> <p>We start gathering fuel for next winter. We will stack it high this year, make a wall we cannot see over. As harvest arrives, we watch our neighbours at their crops and do not offer to help. When it is our turn, they reciprocate.</p> <p>Martha has become increasingly solitary. She is gaining a reputation for rudeness. She tells the Reverend\u2019s wife to keep her baked goods to herself. She shouts at two of the smallest Prossers until they run home crying. She rarely comes to market. When we do see her, we observe that her limp is more pronounced. She stops to rest often.</p> <p>Eliza brings us reports. Martha has a cough that will not mend. She is several times confined to her bed. We bring her the treats invalids are thought to enjoy, borage tea and calves\u2019 feet. She has no appetite. We keep her fire burning, milk Pluen, feed the chickens. When she dies (But that won\u2019t be now, will it? she asks, waking from troubled sleep), we will only need tell the bees.<br></p> <p><em><strong>Shadow</strong></em></p> <p>There is a new prime minister in London. Laws are repealed, laws are passed. Perhaps moths will benefit from the candle tax and robbers from improvements in the highways. Nobody asks our opinion. Like grass, we are meant to thrive unattended, underfoot.</p> <p>We watch the road and the bridge. We look especially hard at visitors on marketdays. In early winter, when a light snow falls, we walk around the lake. We see prints of fox, polecat, badger. Nothing else. As we turn for home, the powder squeaks, curling our spines.</p> <p>If we were rich as the Ingrams, we say, we would put up a stone drinking fountain and have our name carved on it for all to read. We would build clocktowers and almshouses and schools. They would all bear our name.</p> <p>Winter closes around us again. We have no heart for the seasonal festivities. We leave the wren in the hedge, the mistletoe in the trees, the mare\u2019s skull in the barn. We burn through our ramparts of fuel.</p> <p>To no one\u2019s astonishment, the Prossers lose their cow. Fecklessness, we whisper. We should take them some of our own milk, a little oatmeal too. Perhaps tomorrow, we say, moving our feet closer to the fire.</p> <p>When spring comes we are still alive. The day comes up a glistening mist briefly suffused with rose. We dig and trench, plant peas and early cabbages, blister our hands and break our backs. We inspect the walls and ditches we repaired this time last year, this time the year before. Some of us patch a gap here or there, some of us shrug and stare into the distance. The sun falls through the haze like a scarlet millstone.</p> <p>The Protheroe boy and Naomi Price run off in the night, gone to Liverpool, we learn, to seek their fortune in the Americas. John Preece gets an apprenticeship in Bristol. He will be his own master one day, he boasts, master of others. He will be an alderman, a mayor, with glass windows in his house and a gold chain around his neck.</p> <p>We give the pigs extra barley, thinking this year we will feed them until they are too fat to walk. They will have to sit down, like little gentlemen, to take their last meal. We will kill them early, have a feast whose memory will warm us through the cold months. Chops and ribs and belly and brisket, liver and lights and blood pudding. We will eat from one breakfast to the next, saving nothing. If we need a rest, we will lay our heads right there on the table.</p> <p>Sometimes, as we go about our day, a shadow falls. A blackbird clatters in unprovoked alarm. Sometimes we think we see figures on the stone bridge. They have no occupation other than leaning and an ease, leaning, that none of our visible neighbours could achieve. They are looking in our direction. We almost think they are looking at us. We lower our eyes and walk the other way.</p> <p>But at night we cannot sleep for thinking of them, across the lake, drifting on pallets of down and feather. And we wonder if they ever dream of us, or only of morning, when they will come stepping through the rushes, pocketwatches in their pale hands, passing through us like a breeze through leaves, a wave through water.<br></p> <p><em><strong>Notes</strong></em></p> <p>Tylwyth Teg \u2013 not fair and not people</p> <p>Twrch Trwyth \u2013 the cursed but well-coiffed prince boar</p> <p>Englyn \u2013 a short and obedient verse</p> <p>Haf bach Mihangel \u2013 the little summer that we enjoy about Michaelmastime, as rents fall due</p> <p>Milfyw \u2013 called by Linnaeus <em>Luzula campestris</em>; when it appears, we read poetry to the cows</p> <p><br>\u2022 Jo Lloyd is the winner of the 2019 BBC national short story award with Cambridge University.

      "bodyText": "A story inspired by a brief dictionary entry about an 18th-century woman described as a \u201cvoluble hypocrite\u201d has won Jo Lloyd the \u00a315,000 BBC national short story award. In The Invisible, Martha, who claims she is friends with an invisible family, is living in an invisible mansion in Carnarvonshire. It opens: \u201cMr Ingram and his Invisible daughter Miss Ingram live close by, Martha tells us, in a grand, impractical mansion of the type the wealthy favour \u2013 except Invisible, of course \u2013 made from dressed stone the colour of spring cream, with a slate roof and glass in every window.\u201d The Welsh writer discovered Martha\u2019s history by chance, when looking through the online Dictionary of Welsh Biography. The dictionary says Martha \u201csucceeded in persuading many people of that neighbourhood\u201d of her stories \u2013 although eventually doubts began to spread. Chair of the judges and BBC broadcaster Nikki Bedi said thedecision had been unanimous. Five authors had been shortlisted: Lloyd, Lucy Caldwell, Lynda Clark, Jacqueline Crooks and Tamsin Grey. \u201cThe story is unplaceable but deeply resonant. The Invisible\u2019s themes touch on wealth and class, what can be seen and not seen, and what\u2019s precious and what should be valued in the world. You will read and reread it, and be richer every time,\u201d Bedi said. Her fellow judge and the winner of the 2017 prize, Cynan Jones, said Lloyd had painted \u201ca timelessly relevant picture of how we obsess for access to worlds we cannot have\u201d. \u201cIt is,\u201d he said, \u201calso a story about story itself; our need for them, to allow us to see beyond ourselves, and how the stories we buy into can bring us together or push us apart.\u201d Lloyd, who grew up in south Wales, received her award at a ceremony broadcast live on Radio 4 on Tuesday night. The Invisible by Jo Lloyd Across the lake Mr Ingram and his Invisible daughter Miss Ingram live close by, Martha tells us, in a grand, impractical mansion of the type the wealthy favour \u2013 except Invisible, of course \u2013 made from dressed stone the colour of spring cream, with a slate roof and glass in every window. Is that so, we say. They receive numerous Invisible guests, Martha tells us, who must travel here from other Invisible mansions, in other parts of the country. That would follow, we say. They attend fairs and sales about the district. They are regulars at our Wednesday markets. To sell or to buy? They are Invisible! To accomplish trade both parties must be visible, a fact we have not previously had cause to contemplate. Mr Ingram\u2019s mansion, Martha tells us, stands on the other side of the lake, at the foot of the mountain. We have inspected the spot she indicates and confirmed it is in no way remarkable. Cold eels of water slide among rushes and sedges and tumps of starry moss. Cat-gorse and furze cling to rafts of drier ground. Spearwort and flag dip their toes and shiver. Not that we need to search for evidence. If there were a mansion across the lake, our dogs would be howling every time an Ingram passed by. Our daughters would be scouring their pots, our sons sweating in their stables and gardens. Some accuse Martha of fraud, although what she has to gain by it we cannot determine. Others say her wits are failing. We\u2019ve known her put her clothes on back to front and summon her cow with the call meant for hogs. She will stop for minutes on end to watch rooks or lapwings tumble about the sky, as if they bore porridge and dates and the answers to life\u2019s mysteries in their beaks. But most are happy, eager even, to take her at her word. We want to believe that the Invisible have, for whatever purpose, established their Invisible home next to us. It pleases us to imagine them prodding the fat rumps of our livestock, testing our grains with their clean Invisible fingernails. Tell us more, we say, and Martha dimples like a girl. There are many of them, she says. Sometimes the Invisible outnumber other visitors. But why do they come to market? For amusement, I suppose. Entertainment. We look each other up and down, wondering which of us is most entertaining. The Ingrams have called at Martha\u2019s cottage, of an evening, to pay their respects. Miss Ingram has such pale hands, Martha says. As if she keeps them folded away in a linen chest. What language do they speak? It is English, I presume. I seem to understand some of it. But their speech is strange. Until you are very close, it\u2019s like a noise of leaves or water. We cannot think why, of all of us, they would choose Martha. She is not the most educated or wise. Not even the most gullible. Invite us along next time they visit, says Jacob. That should sort the wheat from the goats. They wouldn\u2019t allow it, Martha says. What are you afraid of? Jacob says. Let\u2019s settle this once and for all. Come on Martha, we say. Let\u2019s settle this. Unless you have reason to be afraid. I would love to see Miss Ingram\u2019s dress, says Eliza. And her jewellery. I would love to see how she does her hair. Oh yes, we say. We\u2019d love to see her dress and her hair and her jewellery. It\u2019s out of the question, Martha keeps saying. They would never agree. But if there is one thing we know, it is persistence. Freckled peas The Vestry can find no regulations that apply. In the past, Martha might have been suspected of contracting with demons, but the Parliament in London has repealed the law against witchcraft. We don\u2019t know if this is because we\u2019ve progressed beyond such superstition or because all the witches have been drowned. Martha has never been known as a fool or a liar. Once she claimed to have seen a yellow cat the size of a two-tooth hogget at her door, but perhaps she did, and if not, anyone could make that mistake. Jacob complained that she sold him a calf that was already sick and it expired within a day, but they resolved that dispute between them. Mostly she has lived the way we all do, evenly, tidily, respecting time and season. She plants oats and beans and freckled peas on her late father\u2019s holding, keeps bees and chickens, drives her cow to the grazings. She has no husband or children bringing home a wage from the quarry, but then she has no one for whom she must buy tea and sugar. She is a hard worker, if a slow one. When she was a baby her mother, Rebecca, stumbling, as we understand, let her fall in the hearth. In the moments it took the parents to react, flames bit through the swaddling, gnawed the tender infant limbs. We found Rebecca later in the church porch, hanged dead. Martha was left with a limp and, in her breath, a hiss as of hot ashes settling. But she is not one to make excuses. She salts her own bacon, gathers her own turf and bark. She has a reputation as a pickler and preserver, putting up the greater part of her harvest and whatever she collects from woods and wastes. She\u2019s able to sell her surplus to lazier households. She is careful with her animals, keeping them clean and dry. In hard winters, she stints herself to feed them. Plump and handsome Martha is adamant that the Invisible are not the Tylwyth Teg, who are known to be short and ill-favoured. The Ingrams are as tall as we are, she points out. Taller. They\u2019re plump and handsome. Also the Tylwyth Teg are spiteful. They bear grudges for generations. They hide robins\u2019 eggs in shoes, crumble owl pellets into the flour. The Invisible, Martha says, are smiling always, and if they are not smiling they are laughing. They are generous. Once I saw Miss Ingram pick up a fallen kit and place it back with its fellows. But on further questioning, she admits such acts of charity are rare. Mostly the Invisible keep apart, chattering among themselves. How do they dress? It is the fashion of the city, I suppose, all bright colours and embroidery. And everything always new. Not darned or frayed or even muddy. As if every day is Easter Day. Do any of them resemble your father? John Protheroe the smith wants to know. Or Price Price or Mother Jenkins? But we hush him. We don\u2019t want to think that the contents of our graveyard have got themselves up in their best clothes to trot about among us, formulating opinions. Martha shakes her head. They\u2019re not like anyone I\u2019ve seen before. In looks or behaviour. I believe they\u2019re different from us altogether. Only child Martha\u2019s limp identifies her from some distance. It is of the lurching, stiff-legged variety, like a boat hit side-on by a swell. She uses a stick, for walking only, never hitting. When a beast jibs or straggles, she chides, like a doting granny, in a voice you could mistake for praise. She combs the burs from her cow\u2019s tail. Sometimes, milking, she seems to fall asleep with her head on Pluen\u2019s flank. The only child of only children, since Enoch her father died, Martha has no family at all. She can breakfast at midnight if she pleases, not even trouble to prepare dinner. She has grown thinner these last years. If there were a tempest, such as our forebears talked of, strong enough to strip the thatch from our roofs and topple animals in their stalls, it might blow Martha away altogether, leaving only her shawl hooked in a blackthorn. Enoch wanted Martha to marry Abel Pritchard. There was a conversation and a handshake and for months Pritchard would call to smoke a pipe or play chess with Enoch. On Sundays, Pritchard would walk her to church, and a comical pairing they made, Martha bobbing in the lee of his ox plod. But in the end he found a girl younger and quicker, with a dowry worth the promise. The bitterness between Enoch and Pritchard lasted until the older man\u2019s death. We do not know what Martha thought. The Reverends The Reverend Doctor Clough-Vaughan-Bowen comes all the way from the next county to see Martha. He lodges with the Reverend Rice-Mansel-Evans and early next morning the two men pick their way through a sparkling drizzle to the door of her cottage. Doctor Clough-Vaughan-Bowen is a learned man, of good family. He has written scholarly works, we understand, on subjects of interest to the clergy \u2212 adult baptism or the wearing of the chasuble. Rumour says he had a wife who died giving birth to their dying child. Rumour shrugs. When our neighbours and families suffer such losses we take gifts of hyssop or honey to their door, weep with them beside the new graves. But it is hard to believe that men such as Doctor Clough-Vaughan-Bowen have feelings as sharp or deep as our own. Mwynig and Brithen, we remember, bellow through the night that their calves are taken, but next day turn their inquiries instead to turnips. The Reverend Doctor has not come to reprimand Martha, nor to interrogate her. He talks, in his educated, university English, of which she comprehends a third at most, of many invisible things. Hopes and dreams and memories. The brains of horses. The souls of the dead. The imagination. The future. The swallows sleeping snugly at the bottom of the lake. He talks of the visible, and the traces it leaves. The fountain that sprang up where the saint pressed his thumb into the earth. The rock pierced by the giant\u2019s spear. The stony pawprint left by Arthur\u2019s hound hunting Twrch Trwyth across the mountain tops. You see what I\u2019m saying? he says to Martha. Martha smiles and nods at moments where it seems appropriate. The drizzle gives way to stumps of rainbow parting a watery sky. The reverends pick their way back and Doctor Clough-Vaughan-Bowen takes his leave, apparently satisfied. French sauce Martha has pressed her nose to the windows of Mr Ingram\u2019s mansion. The Invisible dine late, she tells us, but they light neither candle nor lamp. There is no fire even, but they seem warm enough in their cambrics and silks. The ladies\u2019 throats and wrists are bare. They drink wine as red as rosehips from silver goblets. The china is blue and white, thin as a blade, and the table is laid with many dishes. They eat roast meats with French sauce, fillets and cheeks and sirloins, veal fricassey, veal ragoo, snipe, partridge, wheatears, lark livers simmered with cloves, blanched lettuce, white milk-bread, parsley and sweet herbs chopped fine, flummery and posset, clary fritters, heaped bowls of gooseberries and mulberries and quinces, sweetmeats coloured with spinach and beet and delicately fashioned into multitudinous shapes. But who waits at table? we want to know. Who delivers the food? Who cooks it? Martha has seen no Invisible footmen standing to attention, no butchers or vintners at the kitchen door. The Invisible, she insists, are all wealthy. There are no Invisible maids or carpenters or shopkeepers. The Invisible do no work. But how can they live without the poor to serve them? we ask. What about the puddings, says Eliza. Are they spiced? Do they wobble? Are they eaten hot or cold? There are baked puddings and boiled puddings and set puddings, says Martha. Wonderful domed and turreted puddings, like palaces. Thick with candied cherries and angelica. The custard is yellow as buttercups. They sit at table for hours, she tells us, but they talk more than they chew. They don\u2019t gobble their food or help it to their mouths with their fingers, hunting down any fragments that fall and cramming them back in. Tell us about the meats, we say. Tell us about the cream. Tell us about the apricots and persimmons, the roast swans and haunches of venison. Tell us. Englyn We are enjoying a kind of fame. In other districts the gossip is of Martha. The Ingrams are mentioned in a number of sermons. The Dissenters make it yet another opportunity to talk of ale and tithes. Owen Owen composes an englyn on the subject of the Invisible that is perhaps not up to the standard of his early and most beautiful work but we admire its wisdom and one particularly melodious alliteration and some of us learn it to recite to our families as we sit beside our hearths. Markets are visibly better attended and at first we are grateful. But many of the newcomers spend only time, which they use to query and argue, cast aspersions, search behind walls and under trestles, inside calf cots and pig sties. If anyone asks what makes us so interesting, we have no answer. We cannot explain the Invisible\u2019s curiosity. Some of us speculate it may be convenience, a matter of location. Some of us wonder if the attention is always kindly meant. Do they wrinkle their noses as they walk past us? Wave their lace handkerchiefs to clear the air? Do they avert their eyes from our misshapen bodies and pocked faces? Mr Ingram has a gold pocketwatch. He consults it more often than is strictly necessary for someone who has no appointments to keep. Ribbon Some of the young people \u2013 Naomi Price and Megan Prosser and their tittering friends, plus one or two lads who are sweet on them, and Mot, the Prices\u2019 brindled cattle dog \u2212 have taken to aping the behaviour of the Invisible. They practise walking in no special direction and raising their eyebrows while others labour. They affect amazement at sickles and stooks and handlooms and potherbs and piglets. The girls have acquired a silk ribbon that they pass about between them so that one or another, usually Naomi, can wear it in her hair every day. They hold their skirts out of the mud, in the manner of Miss Ingram, and fan themselves with sprays of hawthorn. They have developed a sudden passion for knowledge, pestering Martha with questions. She indulges them until she tires or runs out of observations and then she shooes them away like so many finches. The next day they flock back, nudging and giggling, as at their first day of dame school. Martha tuts fondly and repeats yesterday\u2019s lesson. We think it harmless enough until they neglect their work. Three times, John Protheroe has to fetch his boy back to the forge. There is a great deal of shouting and a coulter is spoiled. Megan judges herself too good to dip rushes, while Naomi protests that stitching or churning will roughen her hands. The Prices are accustomed to their daughter\u2019s airs, but she has corrupted the once-faithful Mot, who now slinks away from his duties at every opportunity to bury his head in Naomi\u2019s knees and sigh as she folds his pretty ears into a bow. The Ingrams should know better than to encourage such foolishness, we say to Martha. You should know better. And when some of us point out that young folk rarely need encouragement, no one listens. We must keep them close to home, we say. The dog can be tied up, but our children need another solution. We give them more chores, more responsibilities, make sure they are too tired for mischief. For a time, we think things back to normal. But the Protheroe boy wears a look of discontent as he works the bellows, and young Preece leans daydreaming on a shovel, next to the lime he should be spreading. As for Naomi, she has declared she will never marry. She would rather stay a spinster, she says, than grow red-cheeked and loose-waisted with a man whose favourite subject is the pigs he smells of. She can be seen rehearsing for her preferred future, strolling alone through marble halls or colonnades of pleached limes, her nose in the air and a frayed gold ribbon trailing behind. Unnavigable It is July and there has been no rain for five weeks. The summer pastures have scorched yellow, then black, as if they have combusted from within, and we bring the herds down early. The lake shrinks. Insects clump and die in its rotting margins. Springs that have never before failed run dry. When the cows complain of their multiple empty stomachs, we offer them leaves and twigs. Harvests are poor all about the district. The Invisible are enjoying the sun, Martha tells us. They walk out at full midday to admire unclimbable heights and horrible precipices. Their hats are large. They spread cloths on the ground before they sit. They picnic on assorted meats, potted and pastried and aspiced. They do a kind of dancing, the figures intricate and indecipherable. What is the music? we want to know. Who plays? Martha shakes her head. There are no musicians. It is in the air perhaps. They take it with them. Rain falls every day of September. The drops gather and hang in fleecy clouds until the commons resemble the floor of a shearing shed. The earth, muddled by these disorderly seasons, squanders her energies on green shoots that will not last the winter. It turns hot again. Haf bach Mihangel. The sunsets are bronze, the dawns like unripe strawberries. The new quarry drops its prices. There is an accident in which two men die and one loses the use of his arm. The Invisible are busy at their sports and pastimes. Not throwing or sparring or chasing a leather ball. Games with mysterious rules and objectives. Mr Ingram covers his eyes and the others circle around him, calling and pointing. Miss Ingram gestures like a bird, or an old woman, and they all laugh. They tilt and balance and yaw and hop and fall. There is no winner. Or they are all winners. It is hard to tell. November. The storms beat at our walls, howling accusations. When the winds drop, the bone chill starts. We count the jars, measure what\u2019s left in barrels and sacks. Every creak is a stranger creeping through the darkness with intent. December. We muffle our noses, warm our hands in our armpits. At night we hug our husbands and children close to steal their heat. The salted meat is used, the pickles and dried fruit gone. We boil hide to make broth. January. February. Those with a cow are drinking milk and praying the hay will last. Those without are living on husks and air. The Prossers have sold their bedding and only a blanket donated by the Reverend keeps their youngest from perishing. The Ingrams must look across the lake, see our cottages dimly lit, some without smoke even. Do they imagine us huddled inside, stupid with cold, our fingers white? In the second half of March, there is a run of dewy bright mornings. The milfyw flowers, and we put the cattle out to graze. They skip and buck like the ogre\u2019s darling children, dip their heads to the celandines to admire their bristled chins. A soft breeze strokes our hair and we hold our faces to the sun. The frogs croak all night. The sparrows get busy in our roofs and we in our beds. But one afternoon the sky is spotted with peewits and golden plovers, fieldfares and redwings. They wheel above us, calling their alarm, then the snow they are fleeing arrives. It is the heaviest fall in ten years, heaping against walls, holding our doors closed. By morning, earth and air are so white that half a mile from us a new shore seems to have formed, before a strange, unnavigable sea. It is days before we can drive our animals to pasture, and when we do, bird corpses litter the ground, too many even for the foxes, and the grass is stewed. When Martha limps into view we forget to ask how she is managing and instead inquire after the Invisible. How do they like the winter? Do they startle when the wind jeers from their chimneys? Do their slates seal out the thaw? They play cards. They enjoy jugged hare and buttered peas, sugar cakes enrobed in sugar. Miss Ingram\u2019s frock is lilac, lit from within like a spring sky. We look at each other. We frown. Some propose going to the Ingrams\u2019 door to beg for work or failing that last night\u2019s bones or a measure of barley. We should get up a committee, perhaps, to remind the Ingrams of their duty to their neighbours. Some even mutter of going in force. We will don dresses and bonnets for disguise, paint our faces white, light torches. But some object. We don\u2019t need violence. Martha will help us. Let us be there when they visit, we say, as we have said before. Let us talk to them. Tell me your demands, she says. I will represent you. But it is not enough. We want to make our own case. We want to hear how they respond. Many of us are wiser than Martha. Many of us know more English. We will not be denied. The Ingrams abhor questions, she says, or importuning. We will be quiet. We will only speak when spoken to. They cannot bear any light but that of the sun and the moon. We are accustomed to darkness, we say. Creaks and ventings In the twilight borrowed from a clear night sky, we recognize our neighbours\u2019 heads and shoulders, their creaks and ventings, familiar from vigils and services. That is Widow Johns, that is Eliza, that is young Jenkin Jenkins, taking advantage of the situation to slide up close to Mary Probert. That is mice hurrying in the thatch. That is Pluen at the other end of the room, grumbling about a greasy trough or spiders in her hay. We yawn and sigh and stretch and fidget. We listen. And finally we hear something. We think we hear something. A padding that is the approach of feet softer than a cat\u2019s, feet that make no mark on the ground. A noise as of leaves or water, gradually increasing. Then a figure rises before us. A figure that is quite obviously, even in this dusk, Jacob, with a shawl draped over his head. He starts speaking, or piping rather, in a high-pitched voice, words that are not words in any language we know. We aren\u2019t sure what to do. Beneath his trill, an undercurrent of confusion and dismay begins. Come along now, that\u2019s enough of that, says Old Mr Jenkins. Jacob keeps on babbling and chirping. He totters in a circle, flaps a lunatic hand. Almost falls over Martha stepping forward to protest, almost saves himself, staggers again, knocks her to the floor. Then we are all up, talking at once, cheering and booing and baying, like a crowd at a hanging. Some help Martha, others pull the cover from Jacob\u2019s head. He is laughing. In a minute a rushlight is burning. Our faces glow red and orange, outraged, amused, disgusted, disappointed. So much for your Invisible, says Jacob, cackling. And some of us cackle with him. So much for lies and nonsense. So much for anyone who thinks themselves better than us. Martha has her face in her hands and Eliza is comforting her, turning every now and then to berate Jacob. Look what you\u2019ve done, says Eliza. And some of us join in. Look what you\u2019ve done. They will never come now. Pullet We scold Jacob until he agrees to apologise. He presents himself at Martha\u2019s cottage with a speckled pullet under his arm. She shuts the door in their faces. Although, in the matter of Jacob\u2019s behaviour, our sympathies lie with Martha, the incident is not unwelcome to everyone. His method was crude, we admit, but he has expressed our own misgivings. Others are confident that Jacob\u2019s stunt has only delayed our meeting with the Invisible. Next time, we say, we will be more particular with our invitations. Martha herself seems to have aged years overnight, as elderly people sometimes do, in a sudden haste to know their end. She will not discuss the abortive visit, nor will she deliver fresh news. Tell us what the Ingrams are up to, we say. Have there been parties or excursions? A masked ball perhaps? But she will say nothing. For a time, we make do with other topics. White peas reach double the price of wheat. Sucking pigs are 15s a head. John Johns and Ruth Prosser break their engagement and a month later mend it. Rachel Protheroe gives birth to twins. The hay is affected by mildew. In the next parish, we hear, a cow is struck by lightning and her calf bleaches white, not a shred of colour left in it. That, we think, is something Miss Ingram might wish to see. But when we say this to Martha, she turns her back. Some point to Martha\u2019s silence as evidence of deceit. Others defend her. It is shameful, we say, to treat an old woman with so little respect. There must be respect on both sides, we respond. We\u2019d sooner listen to Martha than to mischief-makers, we say. Fools are the best audience for foolery, we reply. Rancour and rebuke creep among us like fleas. Friends fall out. Families almost come to blows. Some of us declare ourselves fed up with the whole business and ready to agree with anyone who will leave us in peace. We start gathering fuel for next winter. We will stack it high this year, make a wall we cannot see over. As harvest arrives, we watch our neighbours at their crops and do not offer to help. When it is our turn, they reciprocate. Martha has become increasingly solitary. She is gaining a reputation for rudeness. She tells the Reverend\u2019s wife to keep her baked goods to herself. She shouts at two of the smallest Prossers until they run home crying. She rarely comes to market. When we do see her, we observe that her limp is more pronounced. She stops to rest often. Eliza brings us reports. Martha has a cough that will not mend. She is several times confined to her bed. We bring her the treats invalids are thought to enjoy, borage tea and calves\u2019 feet. She has no appetite. We keep her fire burning, milk Pluen, feed the chickens. When she dies (But that won\u2019t be now, will it? she asks, waking from troubled sleep), we will only need tell the bees. Shadow There is a new prime minister in London. Laws are repealed, laws are passed. Perhaps moths will benefit from the candle tax and robbers from improvements in the highways. Nobody asks our opinion. Like grass, we are meant to thrive unattended, underfoot. We watch the road and the bridge. We look especially hard at visitors on marketdays. In early winter, when a light snow falls, we walk around the lake. We see prints of fox, polecat, badger. Nothing else. As we turn for home, the powder squeaks, curling our spines. If we were rich as the Ingrams, we say, we would put up a stone drinking fountain and have our name carved on it for all to read. We would build clocktowers and almshouses and schools. They would all bear our name. Winter closes around us again. We have no heart for the seasonal festivities. We leave the wren in the hedge, the mistletoe in the trees, the mare\u2019s skull in the barn. We burn through our ramparts of fuel. To no one\u2019s astonishment, the Prossers lose their cow. Fecklessness, we whisper. We should take them some of our own milk, a little oatmeal too. Perhaps tomorrow, we say, moving our feet closer to the fire. When spring comes we are still alive. The day comes up a glistening mist briefly suffused with rose. We dig and trench, plant peas and early cabbages, blister our hands and break our backs. We inspect the walls and ditches we repaired this time last year, this time the year before. Some of us patch a gap here or there, some of us shrug and stare into the distance. The sun falls through the haze like a scarlet millstone. The Protheroe boy and Naomi Price run off in the night, gone to Liverpool, we learn, to seek their fortune in the Americas. John Preece gets an apprenticeship in Bristol. He will be his own master one day, he boasts, master of others. He will be an alderman, a mayor, with glass windows in his house and a gold chain around his neck. We give the pigs extra barley, thinking this year we will feed them until they are too fat to walk. They will have to sit down, like little gentlemen, to take their last meal. We will kill them early, have a feast whose memory will warm us through the cold months. Chops and ribs and belly and brisket, liver and lights and blood pudding. We will eat from one breakfast to the next, saving nothing. If we need a rest, we will lay our heads right there on the table. Sometimes, as we go about our day, a shadow falls. A blackbird clatters in unprovoked alarm. Sometimes we think we see figures on the stone bridge. They have no occupation other than leaning and an ease, leaning, that none of our visible neighbours could achieve. They are looking in our direction. We almost think they are looking at us. We lower our eyes and walk the other way. But at night we cannot sleep for thinking of them, across the lake, drifting on pallets of down and feather. And we wonder if they ever dream of us, or only of morning, when they will come stepping through the rushes, pocketwatches in their pale hands, passing through us like a breeze through leaves, a wave through water.

      "body": "<p>Shortly after revelations first surfaced about Alberto Salazar being investigated by the US Anti-Doping Agency in 2015, I asked a UK Athletics contact whether they feared reputational damage if he was ever convicted. \u201cOf course,\u201d came the reply. \u201cBut we\u2019ve gone all in on Alberto and Nike.\u201d Long past the witching hour in Doha on Monday night, that decision came back to haunt them. And with the legendary American coach now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/01/athletics-coach-alberto-salazar-receives-four-year-ban-for-doping-violations\" title=\"\">banned for four years</a> for \u201corchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct\u201d, UKA now looks desperately short of chips.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/01/athletics-coach-alberto-salazar-receives-four-year-ban-for-doping-violations\">Mo Farah's former coach Alberto Salazar gets four-year ban for doping violations</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>After all, it was not a good look that your performance director Neil Black \u2013 who once hailed Salazar as a \u201cgenius\u201d and \u201cone of the best people to work with that I have ever come across\u201d \u2013 continued to give the American the benefit of the doubt for several years despite damaging accusations made by Panorama programme Catch Me If You Can?</p> \n<p>And it did not exactly inspire confidence when UKA\u2019s own performance oversight management, set up to investigate the interaction of the Nike Oregon Project with its star athlete Mo Farah, found \u201cno reason for concern\u201d \u2013 despite speaking to several whistleblowers.</p> \n<p>You wonder what the investigators, led by former sprinter Jason Gardener and marathon runner Sarah Rowell, were asking. When I spoke to Allan Kupczak, a former massage therapist at the Nike Oregon Project in 2015, he told me Salazar always carried testosterone with him. As he put it: \u201cAlberto would say: \u2018Don\u2019t let anyone touch my bag \u2013 I have my testosterone cream in there. I don\u2019t want anyone to get contaminated accidentally.\u2019 My thought was why risk something that could possibly contaminate the athlete?\u201d</p> \n<p>That raised a red flag for me. Others I spoke to had similar stories. No wonder Steve Magness, the BBC\u2019s main whistleblower, was dismissive about UKA\u2019s enquiry and said that he had only a 30-45 minute interview with their panel.</p> \n<p>So why did UKA not establish more distance from Salazar in 2015? According to one senior insider, the organisation should have done more, but some figures were either too close to Salazar, or did not appreciate the scale of the revelations. \u201cWhere were UK Sport in all this?\u201d the source added. \u201cThey weren\u2019t putting any pressure on UKA to get rid of Salazar at any time up to Rio.\u201d</p> \n<p>However, the biggest factor was Farah himself. The simple fact is he did not want to leave the man who had transformed him from a decent distance runner, who finished seventh in the 5,000m at the 2009 world championships, into an unstoppable title-winning machine between 2011 and 2017.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2e77bf8641fe8ee4265f96faf1dd7d895eaf717f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e77bf8641fe8ee4265f96faf1dd7d895eaf717f/0_0_4172_2728/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mo Farah wins 5,000m gold at London in 2012\" width=\"1000\" height=\"654\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mo Farah wins 5,000m gold at London in 2012.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>That clearly left UK Athletics in a bind. After the BBC Panorama programme aired in June 2015, Farah promised UKA he was going to ditch Salazar. But at some point on a flight from Portland to the UK, he had dramatically changed his mind.</p> \n<p>After that, few in UKA wanted to go against its double Olympic champion \u2013 because they needed his medals \u2013 or be too critical of Nike given its massive kit sponsorship of the organisation. Only UKA\u2019s chairman, Ed Warner, who suggested Farah should suspend his relationship with Salazar, sounded a note of caution. Otherwise everyone stuck to the line: the American was innocent until proven guilty.</p> \n<p>And of course he was. However, there was surely a middle way that would have meant establishing distance from Salazar without condemning him. After all, much of what is in the American Arbitration Association report, which found that Salazar had been \u201corchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct\u201d while head coach of the Nike Oregon Project, was known in 2015 \u2013 including that Salazar infused his athletes with more than the permitted levels of L-carnitine, and got another, Amy Begley, to unwittingly transport an envelope with testosterone cream on it, which he later used in a bizarre experiment on his sons.</p> \n<p>Incidentally, the report contains several fresh testimonies that certainly raise some eyebrows. The American former athlete Danny Mackey says that while he was working at the Nike lab he was told by one of the doctors, Loren Myhre, to take thyroid and testosterone therapy. Mackey testifies that Dr Myhre told him: \u201cThis is what Salazar\u2019s athletes do, and they haven\u2019t gotten caught. You\u2019ll be OK.\u201d Salazar has always denied any wrongdoing with his athletes.</p> \n<p>The report also contains Salazar\u2019s emails to Nike\u2019s chief executive, Mark Parker, in which the coach discusses experimenting with a banned testosterone product called Androgel, which can boost performance, on his own sons. In one of his emails, Salazar indicates that using a small amount does not reach the level that would \u201ctrigger great concern\u201d about failing a test.

      "bodyText": "Shortly after revelations first surfaced about Alberto Salazar being investigated by the US Anti-Doping Agency in 2015, I asked a UK Athletics contact whether they feared reputational damage if he was ever convicted. \u201cOf course,\u201d came the reply. \u201cBut we\u2019ve gone all in on Alberto and Nike.\u201d Long past the witching hour in Doha on Monday night, that decision came back to haunt them. And with the legendary American coach now banned for four years for \u201corchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct\u201d, UKA now looks desperately short of chips. After all, it was not a good look that your performance director Neil Black \u2013 who once hailed Salazar as a \u201cgenius\u201d and \u201cone of the best people to work with that I have ever come across\u201d \u2013 continued to give the American the benefit of the doubt for several years despite damaging accusations made by Panorama programme Catch Me If You Can? And it did not exactly inspire confidence when UKA\u2019s own performance oversight management, set up to investigate the interaction of the Nike Oregon Project with its star athlete Mo Farah, found \u201cno reason for concern\u201d \u2013 despite speaking to several whistleblowers. You wonder what the investigators, led by former sprinter Jason Gardener and marathon runner Sarah Rowell, were asking. When I spoke to Allan Kupczak, a former massage therapist at the Nike Oregon Project in 2015, he told me Salazar always carried testosterone with him. As he put it: \u201cAlberto would say: \u2018Don\u2019t let anyone touch my bag \u2013 I have my testosterone cream in there. I don\u2019t want anyone to get contaminated accidentally.\u2019 My thought was why risk something that could possibly contaminate the athlete?\u201d That raised a red flag for me. Others I spoke to had similar stories. No wonder Steve Magness, the BBC\u2019s main whistleblower, was dismissive about UKA\u2019s enquiry and said that he had only a 30-45 minute interview with their panel. So why did UKA not establish more distance from Salazar in 2015? According to one senior insider, the organisation should have done more, but some figures were either too close to Salazar, or did not appreciate the scale of the revelations. \u201cWhere were UK Sport in all this?\u201d the source added. \u201cThey weren\u2019t putting any pressure on UKA to get rid of Salazar at any time up to Rio.\u201d However, the biggest factor was Farah himself. The simple fact is he did not want to leave the man who had transformed him from a decent distance runner, who finished seventh in the 5,000m at the 2009 world championships, into an unstoppable title-winning machine between 2011 and 2017. That clearly left UK Athletics in a bind. After the BBC Panorama programme aired in June 2015, Farah promised UKA he was going to ditch Salazar. But at some point on a flight from Portland to the UK, he had dramatically changed his mind. After that, few in UKA wanted to go against its double Olympic champion \u2013 because they needed his medals \u2013 or be too critical of Nike given its massive kit sponsorship of the organisation. Only UKA\u2019s chairman, Ed Warner, who suggested Farah should suspend his relationship with Salazar, sounded a note of caution. Otherwise everyone stuck to the line: the American was innocent until proven guilty. And of course he was. However, there was surely a middle way that would have meant establishing distance from Salazar without condemning him. After all, much of what is in the American Arbitration Association report, which found that Salazar had been \u201corchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct\u201d while head coach of the Nike Oregon Project, was known in 2015 \u2013 including that Salazar infused his athletes with more than the permitted levels of L-carnitine, and got another, Amy Begley, to unwittingly transport an envelope with testosterone cream on it, which he later used in a bizarre experiment on his sons. Incidentally, the report contains several fresh testimonies that certainly raise some eyebrows. The American former athlete Danny Mackey says that while he was working at the Nike lab he was told by one of the doctors, Loren Myhre, to take thyroid and testosterone therapy. Mackey testifies that Dr Myhre told him: \u201cThis is what Salazar\u2019s athletes do, and they haven\u2019t gotten caught. You\u2019ll be OK.\u201d Salazar has always denied any wrongdoing with his athletes. The report also contains Salazar\u2019s emails to Nike\u2019s chief executive, Mark Parker, in which the coach discusses experimenting with a banned testosterone product called Androgel, which can boost performance, on his own sons. In one of his emails, Salazar indicates that using a small amount does not reach the level that would \u201ctrigger great concern\u201d about failing a test. To which Parker responds: \u201cIt will be interesting to determine the minimal amount required to create a positive test.\u201d The panel accepted Salazar\u2019s explanation that he was experimenting with testosterone on his sons because he was paranoid that someone might try to spike one of his athletes. However, it added: \u201cWhile the panel accepts [the] Respondent\u2019s contention that the experiment was designed to protect athletes of the NOP, it could have also been conducted as part of a nefarious attempt to \u2018beat\u2019 the testing system and thus is susceptible to creating an appearance of cheating that one could argue would bring the experiment much closer to being \u2018in connection with\u2019 an athlete, competition or training.\u201d There is no evidence that Farah cheated. But sometimes you judge people by the company they keep. And his record of being coached by Salazar, plus his friendship with Jama Aden, who is being investigated by Spanish Anti\u2011Doping, are two strikes against him. Farah denies continuing any relationship with Aden since 2015 when the coach acted as an \u201cunofficial facilitator\u201d to UKA. It is worth remembering, too, that at a press conference in 2015 Farah promised he would speak to whistleblowers. \u201cDefinitely, for my sake,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to know the answers.

I should at least be honest with them.\u201d The passion in his words suggested he was serious. Sadly for him, and UKA, he does not appear to have acted on them.",

      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer is to offer a \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d option to online shoppers as part of a plan to modernise its struggling clothing business which had a \u201clost 18 months\u201d, the company has admitted. While maintaining its crown as the UK\u2019s largest clothing retailer, sales at the high street giant have been falling for seven years. On Tuesday, its chief executive, Steve Rowe, told an investor meeting that letting customers pay for website orders in instalments was one of the \u201ctactical actions\u201d it planned to take to halt the slide. Rival chain Next has a substantial store card-style credit arm, and young shoppers are embracing digital payment systems such as Klarna in growing numbers. M&amp;S is yet to sign a contract with a payment service. M&amp;S is facing an existential crisis as sales migrate online and the recent collapse in its share price has cost the retailer its place in the prestigious FTSE 100. Rowe confessed to analysts that the revamp of its clothing business was 18 months behind schedule and he was still trying to fix \u201cthe basics: its buyers still bought too many clothes that didn\u2019t sell, while popular lines sold out. Jill McDonald, its clothing boss, was ousted in July after buying mistakes ahead of a jeans promotion left it with empty rails for a month. While much of the focus falls on M&amp;S\u2019s womenswear business, the company admitted its menswear division needed attention after its market share had slipped by 1.5 percentage points over the last five years. Shoppers had told it the clothes were \u201ctoo old\u201d and the fightback involved it stocking more slim and skinny-fit trousers. With the Brexit deadline looming the company told the investor meeting that crashing out without a deal would have a substantial impact on its food-hall arm, where sales have stabilised under Stuart Machin. The turnaround is being steered by Archie Norman, its no-nonsense chairman of two years, and there are signs that he is growing impatient with performance. Last week the company said Humphrey Singer, its newish finance director, was, like McDonald, also headed for the exit. Berenberg analyst Michelle Wilson said that until the overdue overhaul was complete the retailer was \u201cfighting with one hand tied behind its back\u201d against more agile peers. \u201cWe were left feeling that there is still a lot to do,\u201d she said. The shares closed up nearly 2% at 187.75p.",

      "bodyText": "Ukraine has opened an investigation into Yuriy Lutsenko, a former prosecutor who fed information about the Biden family to Rudy Giuliani, shortly after he left the country, apparently for an English language course. It was not immediately clear if the investigation launched on Tuesday is a form of political retribution for Lutsenko\u2019s role in an international scandal that has led Democrats to open an impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump. Lutsenko is one of several prosecutors who shared information with Giuliani that claimed to show that Joe Biden scuttled an investigation into his son\u2019s business dealings with a Ukrainian company, Burisma. The investigation caught Trump\u2019s attention and in a July phone call, he repeatedly told Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate the Biden family while withholding military aid. Last week, a whistleblower complaint about the call with the Ukrainian president prompted Democrats to launch the impeachment inquiry. Lutsenko has since said that the investigation did not show that the Biden family had broken any laws in Ukraine. Zelenskiy on Tuesday said that he did not feel pressured by Trump and had never met or spoken with Giuliani, despite the former New York mayor\u2019s repeated attempts to contact him or travel to Kyiv. The investigation into Lutsenko was opened at the request of a lawmaker in the president\u2019s party, who said he suspected the former prosecutor of ties to underground gambling in the capital, Kyiv. A spokesperson for the State Bureau of Investigations confirmed the investigation to local media, saying that it was an inquiry into \u201cabuse of office for facilitating illegal gambling\u201d. Lutsenko told reporters earlier this week that he was flying to the United Kingdom to attend a six-week language course to prepare for the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) exam. He did not appear to be joking. His spokeswoman has also said that he had has left to study English.",

Delivering the sermon in Westminster Abbey on Tuesday, the Rt Rev Dame Sarah Mullally referred to the \u201cchaos and confusion\u201d of the Brexit crisis and praised Magna Carta for holding the king \u2013 and by implication the executive \u2013 to account. The annual ceremony for the start of the legal year was held a week after the supreme court handed down its unanimous 11-strong judgment that Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament for five weeks at the height of the Brexit crisis was unlawful. Hundreds of the UK\u2019s most senior judges in their traditional wigs and scarlet and ermine, purple-embroidered or blue-lapelled robes thronged the abbey for the hour-long service. The lord chancellor and justice secretary, Robert Buckland, gave the first reading on Solomon\u2019s judgment. The biblical king\u2019s threat to cut a disputed baby in two was probably not intended to come across as a modern parable for the Conservative party.

The figures, obtained through Freedom of Information (FoI) requests by BBC Radio 4\u2019s File on 4 programme, show that last year \u00a341,265 was granted by the Legal Aid Agency (LAA) towards the legal fees of families\u2019 representation for those who had died in police custody. By contrast, the 32 police forces in England, Wales and Northern Ireland that replied showed their legal bills for the inquests came to nearly \u00a3410,000 \u2013 10 times the amount granted for families\u2019 legal costs. Julie\u2019s Mental Health Foundation submitted similar FoI requests to 53 mental health trusts in England asking how much they spent on lawyers at inquests in the financial year 2017-18. Among the 26 trusts that responded, expenditure on legal representation at inquests was around \u00a34m. In the same year the LAA paid a total of \u00a3118,000 towards fees for legal representation at inquests for families following the death of a relative in contact with mental health services.

The editorial standards chief, David Jordan, had said Walker was not investigated because he was not mentioned in the complaint, with the BBC later clarifying that he meant Walker was not mentioned in the revised viewer grievance that went to the top-level executive complaints unit. Hall has repeatedly defended the BBC\u2019s commitment to impartial news coverage in the face of politically motivated complaints about its output from across the spectrum. The corporation\u2019s guidelines state that audiences should not be able to tell the personal opinions of journalists or news and current affairs presenters on matters of public policy, political, or industrial controversy. Roger Mosey, a former head of BBC TV news, suggested the corporation often found itself struggling with its own bureaucracy when it came to contentious decisions. \u201cThere\u2019s a respect for process which means they end up for the first four or five days defending the process and it\u2019s only late in the day that you decide you can\u2019t really defend the conclusion of the process,\u201d he said. \u201cStaff are now really confused about what can and can\u2019t be said on air, and what\u2019s lived experience and what\u2019s not.\u201d He said the BBC could now face demands from presenters who were religious conservatives to reflect on issues such as the teaching of same-sex relationships in schools or Jewish reporters could wish to offer personal responses to allegations of antisemitism in the Labour party. The corporation has previously attempted to quash public protests this year from some of its LGBT journalists, arguing that some issues surrounding gay rights should not be up for debate. Hundreds of journalists across the BBC\u2019s domestic news service and the World Service \u2013 including some senior on-air correspondents \u2013 have taken the highly unusual step of sending an internal letter to Hall demanding reform. They want a codified approach on how the corporation can report on issues of race in an increasingly polarised world, as it faces bad faith complaints from political campaigners about its output. \u201cIt asked the director general to strengthen the BBC\u2019s guidelines on reporting racism,\u201d said one person who has seen the correspondence. \u201cIt also called for a review of diversity and equality policy across newsrooms - which many staff feel has failed to ensure BAME staff progress through newsrooms to enter senior editorial positions.\u201d Even some BBC journalists who feel angry that Munchetty was singled out by the corporation believe she did technically breach the code as it is currently framed.

The individual allegedly said they were unaware the original viewer complaint also mentioned Walker until they read it in the Guardian. Hall\u2019s decision to overturn the ruling also raises questions about the independence and authority of the BBC\u2019s in-house executive complaints unit, given the director general has now shown he is willing to overturn its decisions in the face of sustained public pressure. Under the current rules, the media regulator, Ofcom, which handles complaints for all commercial broadcasters, can only consider complaints if the BBC is unhappy with the original decision. Jeremy Corbyn, who is engaged in a lengthy dispute with the BBC over a Panorama programme regarding allegations of antisemitism in the Labour party, said the BBC must apologise and overhaul its complaints procedure. \u201cWhen people of colour call out racism they should be listened to and supported,\u201d he said. \u201cAction should be taken against racists, not those that challenge them.\u201d Boris Johnson declined to comment on the issue.

People who use triangular nylon tea bags are the latest group to be shocked at their exposure to plastics.

For two days her name is listed as \u201cUnknown Unknown\u201d until she wakes up and the nurses don gown and mask to scrub the dirt out from under her fingernails and drown her calloused skin in moisturiser. When she has wolfed down an extra breakfast, they sit her by a cheery window with sunshine streaming through. This is where I meet her, silently praising the nurses who have transformed her.</p> <p>I ask her how she\u2019s feeling.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/sep/24/homelessness-is-now-part-of-all-our-lives-heres-what-you-can-do-to-help\">Homelessness is now part of all our lives. Here's what you can do to help</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cMuch better, thank you,\u201d she replies.</p> <p>She holds out the arm which had gone limp in the park due to the way she slept on it. An infection requiring intravenous antibiotics has also improved. As I examine her with my residents, I am struck by her politeness and even a certain humility.</p> <p>The notes say that at just 30 years, she has a stubborn drug habit, a chronic mental illness and has been in and out of jail. And she is homeless. Patients like her can be argumentative, wary and seemingly ungrateful. They are always on their guard, as if waiting to be blamed. But she is different \u2013 quiet, self-contained, almost reflective.</p> <p>An urgent imperative in any public hospital is to start thinking about discharge destination as soon as the patient arrives. We will summon the usual services including social work, psychiatry and addiction medicine, but they will all want to know a plan.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re better, where will you go?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy friend\u2019s place.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d I have seen many such non-arrangements in my time.</p> <p>\u201cIf not, my dad will take me.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Why does she buy drugs? Why does she make poor decisions? How does she end up in jail?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At this, I relax. The fallback on a parent works out more often than not but I make a mental note to talk to her father.</p> <p>Two days later, when he arrives, her father is visibly irritated at the idea of discharging her at all.</p> <p>He says we can\u2019t \u201cprove\u201d that her infection has settled. I respond politely that on this, my clinical judgment is backed by tests heading in the right direction. The infection might recur, he presses. That\u2019s a risk for anyone, I concede, but the answer is not to prolong a hospital stay or to give unnecessary antibiotics. Other people stay much longer, he argues. Each patient hopefully stays only for as long as necessary, I reason.</p> <p>Now his eyes take on a new desperation. Asking to speak to me alone, he implores me to do something because he can\u2019t have his daughter at the mercy of the elements and drug dealers. Out on the streets, there is no food, no safety, no doctor. He seeks a guaranteed admission to crisis accommodation but of course, this isn\u2019t how such places work. We both know that many homeless individuals and families are turned away due to a lack of space. \u201cWorst of all,\u201d he says, \u201cwe have no way of being in touch. She rarely finds a phone to call me. In between, I have no idea.\u201d</p> <p>As a mother, this lament pierces my heart, and I decide that this poor woman really needs a whole new beginning. A new home, a new education, a new outlook, new friends. It would be a slow process but with a potential 50 years of life ahead, it would be a worthwhile investment.</p> <p>But my thinking is drowned by the insistent reminders to make room for those who have spent a night on an emergency department trolley. These are people who have suffered a stroke or heart attack where timely intervention saves lives. People with an acute psychotic episode or vegetative depression who can\u2019t possibly go home. The elderly, often cognitively and physically impaired, who will spend months in hospital while we undertake the tedious paperwork of residential care placement because incredibly, no one anticipated this. Of course, all these patients deserve our help but when we only focus on them, we inevitably let down the ones who are medically \u201cstable\u201d but whose other problems make them the most unstable of all.</p> <p>Even as we care for her with all our energy, we try to not judge. Why does she buy drugs? Why does she make poor decisions? How does she end up in jail? We don\u2019t know enough but what we do know is that untreated mental illness and homelessness make a destructive combination with many downstream effects. Personal responsibility is helped by the right circumstances.</p> <p>Such patients are no stranger to the public hospital system which is obliged to open its doors to allcomers. What then is our social contract with them? Perhaps there isn\u2019t one. Perhaps the raison d\u2019etre of a public hospital is to treat medical illness and accept that entrenched poverty, homelessness, drug addiction and chronic mental health issues are simply beyond our remit. This would certainly ease our conscience, but it doesn\u2019t seem right, especially when such patients are the most likely to <a href=\"http://homelesshealthcare.org.au/hospital-discharges-to-no-fixed-address-heres-a-much-better-way/\">return to our doors, each time a little sicker</a>, a little more expensive and time-consuming. The truth is, medical illness cannot be separated from <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-03-16/cheaper-to-provide-homes-for-homeless-rather-sleep-rough/8354284\">socioeconomic factors</a>, which is why good healthcare needs better out-of-hospital supports.</p> <p>Midway through my conversation with the father, it dawns on me that not once has he broached the subject of taking his daughter home, something that she will need to know too. This means explicitly ruling out the option.</p> <p>I feel a little sad but not knowing the facts, frame my question in the most nonjudgmental way possible.</p> <p>\u201cI understand she will not be going home with you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/may/30/homelessness-becoming-concentrated-in-sydney-and-melbourne-study-finds\">Homelessness becoming concentrated in Sydney and Melbourne, study finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>No explanation is offered, none is requested.</p> <p>Later, I return to the patient.

      "bodyText": "\u201cIn an ideal world, what would you like me to do?\u201d \u201cGet her clean and find her a home.\u201d Emergency services found her in a park under the influence of drugs and alcohol, scraped, bruised and incontinent. For two days her name is listed as \u201cUnknown Unknown\u201d until she wakes up and the nurses don gown and mask to scrub the dirt out from under her fingernails and drown her calloused skin in moisturiser. When she has wolfed down an extra breakfast, they sit her by a cheery window with sunshine streaming through. This is where I meet her, silently praising the nurses who have transformed her. I ask her how she\u2019s feeling. \u201cMuch better, thank you,\u201d she replies. She holds out the arm which had gone limp in the park due to the way she slept on it. An infection requiring intravenous antibiotics has also improved. As I examine her with my residents, I am struck by her politeness and even a certain humility. The notes say that at just 30 years, she has a stubborn drug habit, a chronic mental illness and has been in and out of jail. And she is homeless. Patients like her can be argumentative, wary and seemingly ungrateful. They are always on their guard, as if waiting to be blamed. But she is different \u2013 quiet, self-contained, almost reflective. An urgent imperative in any public hospital is to start thinking about discharge destination as soon as the patient arrives. We will summon the usual services including social work, psychiatry and addiction medicine, but they will all want to know a plan. \u201cWhen you\u2019re better, where will you go?\u201d \u201cMy friend\u2019s place.\u201d \u201cReally?\u201d I have seen many such non-arrangements in my time. \u201cIf not, my dad will take me.\u201d At this, I relax. The fallback on a parent works out more often than not but I make a mental note to talk to her father. Two days later, when he arrives, her father is visibly irritated at the idea of discharging her at all. He says we can\u2019t \u201cprove\u201d that her infection has settled. I respond politely that on this, my clinical judgment is backed by tests heading in the right direction. The infection might recur, he presses. That\u2019s a risk for anyone, I concede, but the answer is not to prolong a hospital stay or to give unnecessary antibiotics. Other people stay much longer, he argues. Each patient hopefully stays only for as long as necessary, I reason. Now his eyes take on a new desperation. Asking to speak to me alone, he implores me to do something because he can\u2019t have his daughter at the mercy of the elements and drug dealers. Out on the streets, there is no food, no safety, no doctor. He seeks a guaranteed admission to crisis accommodation but of course, this isn\u2019t how such places work. We both know that many homeless individuals and families are turned away due to a lack of space. \u201cWorst of all,\u201d he says, \u201cwe have no way of being in touch. She rarely finds a phone to call me. In between, I have no idea.\u201d As a mother, this lament pierces my heart, and I decide that this poor woman really needs a whole new beginning. A new home, a new education, a new outlook, new friends. It would be a slow process but with a potential 50 years of life ahead, it would be a worthwhile investment. But my thinking is drowned by the insistent reminders to make room for those who have spent a night on an emergency department trolley. These are people who have suffered a stroke or heart attack where timely intervention saves lives. People with an acute psychotic episode or vegetative depression who can\u2019t possibly go home. The elderly, often cognitively and physically impaired, who will spend months in hospital while we undertake the tedious paperwork of residential care placement because incredibly, no one anticipated this. Of course, all these patients deserve our help but when we only focus on them, we inevitably let down the ones who are medically \u201cstable\u201d but whose other problems make them the most unstable of all. Even as we care for her with all our energy, we try to not judge. Why does she buy drugs? Why does she make poor decisions? How does she end up in jail? We don\u2019t know enough but what we do know is that untreated mental illness and homelessness make a destructive combination with many downstream effects. Personal responsibility is helped by the right circumstances. Such patients are no stranger to the public hospital system which is obliged to open its doors to allcomers. What then is our social contract with them? Perhaps there isn\u2019t one. Perhaps the raison d\u2019etre of a public hospital is to treat medical illness and accept that entrenched poverty, homelessness, drug addiction and chronic mental health issues are simply beyond our remit. This would certainly ease our conscience, but it doesn\u2019t seem right, especially when such patients are the most likely to return to our doors, each time a little sicker, a little more expensive and time-consuming. The truth is, medical illness cannot be separated from socioeconomic factors, which is why good healthcare needs better out-of-hospital supports. Midway through my conversation with the father, it dawns on me that not once has he broached the subject of taking his daughter home, something that she will need to know too. This means explicitly ruling out the option. I feel a little sad but not knowing the facts, frame my question in the most nonjudgmental way possible. \u201cI understand she will not be going home with you.\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d No explanation is offered, none is requested. Later, I return to the patient. If she feels let down, she doesn\u2019t show it. To me, she looks ashamed at all the attention and a little overwhelmed by the problems that face her. \u201cWhat else can I do?\u201d I ask her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d she says softly. \u201cI\u2019ll get by.\u201d I ask her to stay another night, hoping that a solution will present itself the next morning. But early that morning, she signs herself out. There is no doctor to send a discharge summary to, but the formality must be completed. Under presenting illness, it says: \u201cHomeless patient found unconscious in local park.\u201d Under management, we write: \u201cTreatment of infection with antibiotics and fluids.\u201d Lastly, under follow-up: \u201cPatient left at own risk. Destination unknown. Unable to arrange services.\u201d \u2022 Ranjana Srivastava is an Australian oncologist, award-winning author and Fulbright scholar. Her latest book is called A Better Death",

      "bodyText": "The New South Wales government is considering legislation that could limit the ability for planning authorities to rule out coalmines projects based on the climate change impact of emissions from the coal once it is burned. It comes after a campaign from the NSW Minerals Council over decisions that have referenced the impact of \u201cscope 3 greenhouse gas emissions\u201d as a reason for either rejecting a mining project entirely or for imposing conditions on it. For a coalmine, scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions are from the burning of the coal after it is sold into the market, including overseas. The planning minister, Rob Stokes, said it was \u201cnot appropriate for state governments to impose conditions about emissions policies in other countries\u201d. He said the government was looking at a range of options, including legislation or a new guideline for how planning authorities should factor scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions into the assessment process. The recent decisions include the NSW land and environment court\u2019s rejection of the Rocky Hill coalmine in February, which cited the impact the mine would have on climate change, including through the burning of coal in other countries, at a time when \u201ca rapid and deep decrease\u201d in global emissions was urgently needed. In August, the NSW Independent Planning Commission approved the expanded United Wambo coal project near Singleton but as a condition said the coal could only be exported to countries that have ratified the Paris agreement. In September the commission rejected the development of a greenfield coalmine in NSW\u2019s Bylong Valley, citing the impact the mine would have on groundwater, agricultural land and on climate change. The NSW Minerals Council has since launched attack ads that target the planning system for \u201cfailing the people of NSW\u201d. In a statement last week, the council\u2019s chief executive Stephen Galilee said the decision to launch a campaign came after months of \u201cwarnings to the minister for planning and others in the government about the risk of the planning system to jobs and investment\u201d. He said the situation had reached \u201ccrisis point\u201d with the Bylong Valley decision. Stokes said the Minerals Council was one of the stakeholders the government was consulting in its development of a policy on scope 3 emissions. \u201cWe are working with key stakeholders, including the federal government, NSW Minerals Council and consent authorities, to develop a clear policy direction as quickly as possible to provide certainty to the community, industry and investors,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are looking at a range of options including legislation.\u201d The consent authorities in this instance include the NSW land and environment court. But environment groups are warning the government not to bow to pressure from the mining industry. Lock the Gate said the impact of downstream greenhouse gas emissions \u201cis arguably the most complicated, severe and lasting environmental impact of NSW\u2019 export coalmines\u201d. Lock the Gate coordinator George Woods said the public should also have a say in how planning decisions address the climate consequences of coal developments and that should be done through a public hearing process run by the independent planning commission. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing and frankly dangerous for the planning minister to narrowly consult only with the mining industry on a matter of profound importance like this,\u201d she said. \u201cThe mining industry has flexed its political muscle but the government really needs to address the bigger issue and the public sentiment on this.\u201d Elaine Johnson, the principal lawyer with the Environmental Defenders Office of NSW, which represented Groundswell Gloucester in the Rocky Hill case, said if the government was planning changes to the way planning authorities consider scope 3 emissions, the consultation for that should be broad and include other key stakeholders such as community and environment groups. \u201cThe land and environment court, in the Rocky Hill decision, has confirmed that it is entirely appropriate for decision-makers to impose conditions on projects that will contribute to dangerous climate change in a planning context,\u201d Johnson said. She said that was recognised by the independent planning commission in the United Wambo and Bylong Valley assessments. \u201cWe would also say that in 2019 we are making planning decisions in a context which includes advice from the world\u2019s best scientists that we\u2019re approaching a climate emergency,\u201d she said. \u201cIf global emissions continue to rise and if serious action is not taken at all levels of government, by communities and business, the impacts of dangerous climate change will be catastrophic.\u201d The NSW Minerals Council said recent independent planning commission decisions related to emissions generated in other countries were \u201cinconsistent with the Paris agreement and its associated greenhouse gas accounting framework\u201d. \u201cThe NSW government has attempted to clarify its policy on scope 3 emissions through correspondence to the IPC but this has been disregarded,\u201d Galilee told Guardian Australia. \u201cThe NSW government must therefore provide legislative and policy certainty on this issue.\u201d",

Xavier O\u2019Halloran, acting director of the Superannuation Consumers\u2019 Centre at Choice, explains how you can make the biggest impact in a single afternoon.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/30/josh-frydenberg-defends-superannuation-inquiry-against-claims-of-bias\">Josh Frydenberg defends superannuation inquiry against claims of bias</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>1.30pm: Figure out where your super is hiding</strong></h2> <p>Many Australians have to log into MyGov, the government\u2019s online services portal, to manage things like their taxes. The service also has a record of all of your superannuation accounts \u2013 and there might be several. You can see all of your superannuation accounts by clicking on the ATO section of the site. \u201cEvery time you start a new job, unless you\u2019re paying attention, you basically get set up with a new account,\u201d O\u2019Halloran says. \u201cThat means you\u2019re paying two sets of fees, two sets of insurance policies. And they estimate that that will cost you across a lifetime about $50,000 in retirement savings if you don\u2019t consolidate them.\u201d In the super tab of MyGov, you\u2019ll see the details of every super account you\u2019ve ever had, including inactive ones.</p> <h2><strong>1.45pm: Choose where to consolidate</strong></h2> <p>Once you know where your super is, you need to pick the right fund to consolidate into. \u201cThis is where it gets a little bit tougher, because at the moment, there\u2019s not really any good information out there,\u201d O\u2019Halloran explains. When researching your super accounts \u2013 or deciding whether or not to switch to a new one altogether \u2013 there are two factors to keep in mind: fees and returns.</p> <p>With fees, O\u2019Halloran has a simple rule of thumb: \u201cAnything over 1% in fees per year [is] on the expensive side.\u201d Because super compounds over time, tiny variations in fees can have a significant impact. \u201cIf you\u2019re talking about a half per cent difference in fees, across the entire lifetime, that\u2019s about $100,000.\u201d It\u2019s easy to find out what sort of fees a super fund charges using something called a product dashboard. If you Google a super fund\u2019s name and \u201cproduct dashboard\u201d you\u2019ll be able to find a \u201cone pager\u201d that\u2019s \u201cbasically a little cheat sheet that you can use to figure out what the fees are\u201d.</p> <p>When it comes to assessing your fund\u2019s returns, O\u2019Halloran suggests looking at the \u201cmedium to long term\u201d \u2013 how the fund has performed over the past five to 10 years. \u201cDon\u2019t be looking at what happened last year, because funds and markets change really rapidly. You want to look at consistent performance.\u201d</p> <p>Choice has recently released a tool that allows you to search superannuation funds <a href=\"https://meowmixapps.shinyapps.io/returntab/\">based on their five-year net returns</a>. If your super fund is in the bottom 25% it might be a supervillain of super. \u201cThere\u2019s a few in there that probably you don\u2019t want to be in. Unless you\u2019re looking for something really particular with those funds.\u201d One particular reason to go with a low-return fund is risk level. People on the verge of retirement \u201cshouldn\u2019t be in a really high-risk option because if the market suddenly crashes, they\u2019ll be really badly off\u201d. Not all low-return funds are low risk, so if you\u2019re close to retirement, risk is worth researching too. If you\u2019re younger \u201cyou can go high risk.

      "bodyText": "Whether retirement is in your distant or not so distant future, it\u2019s worth carving out some time to manage your superannuation. Xavier O\u2019Halloran, acting director of the Superannuation Consumers\u2019 Centre at Choice, explains how you can make the biggest impact in a single afternoon. 1.30pm: Figure out where your super is hiding Many Australians have to log into MyGov, the government\u2019s online services portal, to manage things like their taxes. The service also has a record of all of your superannuation accounts \u2013 and there might be several. You can see all of your superannuation accounts by clicking on the ATO section of the site. \u201cEvery time you start a new job, unless you\u2019re paying attention, you basically get set up with a new account,\u201d O\u2019Halloran says. \u201cThat means you\u2019re paying two sets of fees, two sets of insurance policies. And they estimate that that will cost you across a lifetime about $50,000 in retirement savings if you don\u2019t consolidate them.\u201d In the super tab of MyGov, you\u2019ll see the details of every super account you\u2019ve ever had, including inactive ones. 1.45pm: Choose where to consolidate Once you know where your super is, you need to pick the right fund to consolidate into. \u201cThis is where it gets a little bit tougher, because at the moment, there\u2019s not really any good information out there,\u201d O\u2019Halloran explains. When researching your super accounts \u2013 or deciding whether or not to switch to a new one altogether \u2013 there are two factors to keep in mind: fees and returns. With fees, O\u2019Halloran has a simple rule of thumb: \u201cAnything over 1% in fees per year [is] on the expensive side.\u201d Because super compounds over time, tiny variations in fees can have a significant impact. \u201cIf you\u2019re talking about a half per cent difference in fees, across the entire lifetime, that\u2019s about $100,000.\u201d It\u2019s easy to find out what sort of fees a super fund charges using something called a product dashboard. If you Google a super fund\u2019s name and \u201cproduct dashboard\u201d you\u2019ll be able to find a \u201cone pager\u201d that\u2019s \u201cbasically a little cheat sheet that you can use to figure out what the fees are\u201d. When it comes to assessing your fund\u2019s returns, O\u2019Halloran suggests looking at the \u201cmedium to long term\u201d \u2013 how the fund has performed over the past five to 10 years. \u201cDon\u2019t be looking at what happened last year, because funds and markets change really rapidly. You want to look at consistent performance.\u201d Choice has recently released a tool that allows you to search superannuation funds based on their five-year net returns. If your super fund is in the bottom 25% it might be a supervillain of super. \u201cThere\u2019s a few in there that probably you don\u2019t want to be in. Unless you\u2019re looking for something really particular with those funds.\u201d One particular reason to go with a low-return fund is risk level. People on the verge of retirement \u201cshouldn\u2019t be in a really high-risk option because if the market suddenly crashes, they\u2019ll be really badly off\u201d. Not all low-return funds are low risk, so if you\u2019re close to retirement, risk is worth researching too. If you\u2019re younger \u201cyou can go high risk. You can ride the bumps of the market, because you\u2019re still 20 or 30 years away from retirement date.\u201d 2.45pm: Switch if you have to, consolidate if you don\u2019t If none of the super funds you\u2019re already with offer favourable fees or competitive returns, switching is not complicated. \u201cYou can do it online, most of the time.

The latest Guardian Essential poll, taken in the wake of Morrison\u2019s trip to the US last week, shows that most Australians believe it is important for the prime minister to have a good relationship with the US president, \u201cwhoever they might be\u201d for the good of the nation. While 15% of people disagreed with the statement, 77% agreed, with men and Liberal voters most likely to back a strong relationship. The survey of 1,097 people was taken before Tuesday\u2019s revelation that Australia had agreed to help investigate the genesis of the Mueller inquiry into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 US election, which Trump has suggested was a \u201choax\u201d to bring him down. But while 57% of those surveyed agreed that Morrison had shown \u201cgood diplomacy skills\u201d during his official visit to US, 70% said that he should have joined other world leaders in attending the UN climate summit in New York, which was attended by foreign affairs minister Marise Payne rather than Morrison. About 40% of people strongly agreed that Morrison should have fronted up to the climate summit, with a further 31% saying they somewhat agreed. A breakdown of voting intentions of those who believed the prime minister should have attended the summit \u2013 where Swedish teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg delivered an impassioned speech to world leaders \u2013 shows that 78% of Labor voters thought he should have shown up, compared with 64% of Coalition voters. Morrison defended Australia\u2019s record on climate change at a separate speech to the UN, but observers at the summit said his failure to attend despite being in the US had eroded goodwill for the country on the issue. Voters were also asked whether a good relationship between Morrison and Trump \u201creflects badly\u201d on Australia, a sentiment that 38% of people agreed with, with 48% disagreeing. Greens voters were most likely to be critical of the relationship forged between Morrison and Trump, with 60% saying it was a bad look, compared with 27% of Coalition voters and 48% of Labor voters. But while most people were supportive of the US alliance and Morrison\u2019s handling of Trump, just 32% believe his presidency, which has sparked global geopolitical uncertainty, has been good for Australia, with 49% of people disagreeing. Australia\u2019s recent decision to assist the US in the Strait of Hormuz, in what it said would be \u201cmodest, meaningful and time-limited\u201d commitment, was supported by 51% of those surveyed and opposed by 35%. But more people were concerned (57%) that the engagement could plunge Australia into another conflict in the near future as a result. Liberal voters were more supportive of Australia\u2019s engagement in the Middle East and less concerned about future conflict in the region. The Essential poll also gauged voter sentiment on the state of the Australian economy ahead of Tuesday\u2019s decision by the Reserve Bank to cut interest rates to a record low 0.75%. Views were mixed, with an equal third believing the economy was in a good state (32%), poor state (33%) or neither good nor poor (32%). Compared with May last year, more people felt the economy was in a poor state, up nine percentage points and edging closer to the December 2016 high of 36%. Liberal voters were more likely to be positive in their assessment of the economy, with 45% saying it was in \u201cvery good\u201d or \u201cquite good\u201d shape. When asked which indicators were most important in assessing the health of the economy, most people pointed to the unemployment rate, which increased to 5.3% in August from 5.2% in the previous month, as well as the cost of household bills. Half of those who think the national budget surplus is the best indicator for economic performance believe the economy is in a good shape, whereas those who look at household bills to gauge economic strength were the most pessimistic.",

The first inquiry, led by the justice department inspector general, Michael Horowitz \u2013 now completed but unpublished \u2013 focussed narrowly on the background to the granting of a surveillance warrant in 2016 on the Trump campaign member <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/02/who-is-carter-page-trump-ex-adviser-memo-furore-russia-fbi\">Carter Page</a>.</p> \n<p>The second review, set up by Barr in May and led by the US attorney John Durham, is looking at the origins of the Russia investigation, including whether there was bias against the Trump administration among senior officials in the security services.</p> \n<p>Unlike Horowitz\u2019s review, Durham\u2019s has the power to convene a grand jury and subpoena people outside the government. The degree to which overseas intelligence agencies are dutybound to cooperate with the <strong> </strong>inquiry is unclear.</p> \n<p>One UK government source said: \u201cThe intelligence relationship is so close that there is no need to pressurise the UK to cooperate.\u201d </p> \n<p>The Australian government has disclosed that it agreed formally in writing to cooperate, and it is known the former MI6 officer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/15/christopher-steele-trump-russia-dossier-accurate\">Christopher Steele</a> cooperated extensively with Horowitz.

Steele, through his lawyers, had been reluctant to be cross-examined, but was told the UK intelligence services had no objections. The interview focused on Steele\u2019s knowledge of Russian interference efforts globally, his intelligence collection methods and his findings about Page, whom the FBI ultimately surveilled.</p> \n<p>Steele had previously met a two-person FBI team from the office of Mueller, whose report on Russian interference in the 2016 election was published in April.</p> \n<p>Around the same time as the most recent Steele interview, it was known that Trump was threatening to end the historically close cooperation between the British and the US intelligence services. That threat, first made in public by Pompeo in February, was linked to a US warning that it could not cooperate with an intelligence agency that allowed the Chinese-owned telecoms company Huawei <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/21/huawei-uk-government-telecoms-review-soft-pedal-5g\">access to </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/21/huawei-uk-government-telecoms-review-soft-pedal-5g\"> UK 5G networks</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/01/donald-trump-urged-scott-morrison-help-discredit-mueller-inquiry\">Australian government agreed to help Donald Trump investigate Mueller inquiry origins</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Trump withdrew the threat at a press conference with Theresa May after he met her and the then foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, privately to discuss the issue, despite there being no apparent change of position from the UK on Huawei. The president would have known by then that Steele was cooperating with his justice department inquiry.</p> \n<p>Asked if Washington was ready to \u201cimpose limits on intelligence sharing\u201d, the US president replied: \u201cNo, because we are going to have absolutely an agreement on Huawei and everything else. We have an incredible intelligence relationship and we will be able to work out any differences.\u201d</p> \n<p>Barr\u2019s visit to Italy largely stemmed from claims by the former Trump aide <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/07/george-papadopoulos-trump-adviser-sentenced-russia\">George Papadopoulos</a> that Italy holds the key to identifying the source of alleged smears against Trump in 2016.</p> \n<p>Papadopoulos, briefly a member of the advisory committee for foreign policy in the Trump election campaign, told the then Australian high commissioner to the UK, Alexander Downer, in 2016 that Russia possessed emails hacked from Democratic party servers that were damaging to Clinton.

I can\u2019t offer you any more information.\u201d</p> \n<p>Papadopoulos has served a jail sentence for lying to the FBI about claims a Maltese academic, Joseph Mifsud, was the source of his information on Russia. He has said without evidence that Mifsud is an agent of the Italian secret service, and sought to entrap him. Mifsud has been missing for two years.</p> \n<p>Papadopoulos had made a series of allegations about Downer\u2019s motives. However, Downer is a conservative, a supporter of Brexit, and not seen as a man to try to deliberately undermine Trump for political purposes.</p> \n<p>The UK Foreign Office said in a statement: \u201cInvestigations in the US are a matter for the US authorities.

William Barr met British intelligence officials in London on 29 July at a meeting attended by intelligence agencies from the Five Eyes group. He was accompanied by the US homeland security department\u2019s acting deputy secretary, David Pekoske. The meeting was formally about the risks and opportunities of new technologies but Barr also raised his inquiries into the FBI investigation. A Whitehall official said the issue of UK cooperation was discussed informally and only on the margins of the meeting. US officials have said Barr\u2019s role is confined to ensuring that the official inquiry team members are introduced to the right people. It has been reported that Barr is pressing a range of foreign powers to cooperate with his effort to piece together the origins of the FBI investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s links with Russia. Barr\u2019s critics claim he is seeking to discredit the FBI investigation by constructing a vast conspiracy theory that foreign powers were working to secure Hillary Clinton\u2019s election in 2016. The inquiry by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, showed that Russia was attempting to swing the presidential election in favour of Trump. Barr\u2019s counter-attack has been given an added urgency as Trump seeks to find a way to block potential impeachment hearings. The president is facing claims he threatened to withdraw military aid from Ukraine unless it cooperated with his efforts to find dirt on the former US vice-president Joe Biden, a potential challenger in the 2020 presidential election. Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, began a brief visit to Italy on Tuesday, days after Barr had been in Rome seeking details of what cooperation the Italians may have given to the FBI inquiry. It was reported on Monday that Pompeo had taken part in Trump\u2019s controversial call to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Pompeo also wrote to the House foreign affairs committee rejecting demands from House Democrats for five current and former state department officials to testify before committees investigating the Ukraine scandal. Trump is openly urging his aides to get information from Italy, the UK and Ukraine, reports have said. The president has said: \u201cIt\u2019s the greatest hoax, probably, in the history of our country and somebody has to get to the bottom of it.\u201d Trump\u2019s administration has mounted two investigations into whether overseas agencies played a role in investigating his 2016 campaign. The first inquiry, led by the justice department inspector general, Michael Horowitz \u2013 now completed but unpublished \u2013 focussed narrowly on the background to the granting of a surveillance warrant in 2016 on the Trump campaign member Carter Page. The second review, set up by Barr in May and led by the US attorney John Durham, is looking at the origins of the Russia investigation, including whether there was bias against the Trump administration among senior officials in the security services. Unlike Horowitz\u2019s review, Durham\u2019s has the power to convene a grand jury and subpoena people outside the government. The degree to which overseas intelligence agencies are dutybound to cooperate with the inquiry is unclear. One UK government source said: \u201cThe intelligence relationship is so close that there is no need to pressurise the UK to cooperate.\u201d The Australian government has disclosed that it agreed formally in writing to cooperate, and it is known the former MI6 officer Christopher Steele cooperated extensively with Horowitz. He agreed to be interviewed by US justice department officials in London over his role in preparing a dossier on collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. His evidence was in effect given under oath. Durham has not been in touch with Steele, it is understood. By coincidence, he was interviewed in the week that Trump conducted a state visit to the UK in June. Steele, through his lawyers, had been reluctant to be cross-examined, but was told the UK intelligence services had no objections. The interview focused on Steele\u2019s knowledge of Russian interference efforts globally, his intelligence collection methods and his findings about Page, whom the FBI ultimately surveilled. Steele had previously met a two-person FBI team from the office of Mueller, whose report on Russian interference in the 2016 election was published in April. Around the same time as the most recent Steele interview, it was known that Trump was threatening to end the historically close cooperation between the British and the US intelligence services. That threat, first made in public by Pompeo in February, was linked to a US warning that it could not cooperate with an intelligence agency that allowed the Chinese-owned telecoms company Huawei access to UK 5G networks. Trump withdrew the threat at a press conference with Theresa May after he met her and the then foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, privately to discuss the issue, despite there being no apparent change of position from the UK on Huawei. The president would have known by then that Steele was cooperating with his justice department inquiry. Asked if Washington was ready to \u201cimpose limits on intelligence sharing\u201d, the US president replied: \u201cNo, because we are going to have absolutely an agreement on Huawei and everything else. We have an incredible intelligence relationship and we will be able to work out any differences.\u201d Barr\u2019s visit to Italy largely stemmed from claims by the former Trump aide George Papadopoulos that Italy holds the key to identifying the source of alleged smears against Trump in 2016. Papadopoulos, briefly a member of the advisory committee for foreign policy in the Trump election campaign, told the then Australian high commissioner to the UK, Alexander Downer, in 2016 that Russia possessed emails hacked from Democratic party servers that were damaging to Clinton. Papadopoulos later claimed he was set up. Downer passed the information to the FBI, helping prompt the investigation led by Mueller. Speaking to Australian radio, Downer refused to add to previous comments about his meeting with Papadopoulos. \u201cI\u2019ve just got nothing more to say about it,\u201d he told ABC Radio National. \u201cI mean, I had a conversation with this guy, I passed on the conversation or that one element of the conversation to the Americans and there\u2019s just nothing more to it. I can\u2019t offer you any more information.\u201d Papadopoulos has served a jail sentence for lying to the FBI about claims a Maltese academic, Joseph Mifsud, was the source of his information on Russia. He has said without evidence that Mifsud is an agent of the Italian secret service, and sought to entrap him. Mifsud has been missing for two years. Papadopoulos had made a series of allegations about Downer\u2019s motives. However, Downer is a conservative, a supporter of Brexit, and not seen as a man to try to deliberately undermine Trump for political purposes. The UK Foreign Office said in a statement: \u201cInvestigations in the US are a matter for the US authorities. We won\u2019t comment on the ongoing investigations.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>In a normal game of poker, a bluff cannot continue once it is called. But for Boris Johnson an exposed bluff can just be re-bluffed. The stakes get higher even when the poor hand lies open on the table.</p> <p>Before entering Downing Street, Johnson claimed that deficiencies in Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal were caused by failure of nerve, not weakness in the UK\u2019s position. The theory was that Brussels needed to see kamikaze intent in British eyes: total commitment to quitting the bloc with no deal. Only then would the cowardly continentals yield.

      "bodyText": "In a normal game of poker, a bluff cannot continue once it is called. But for Boris Johnson an exposed bluff can just be re-bluffed. The stakes get higher even when the poor hand lies open on the table. Before entering Downing Street, Johnson claimed that deficiencies in Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal were caused by failure of nerve, not weakness in the UK\u2019s position. The theory was that Brussels needed to see kamikaze intent in British eyes: total commitment to quitting the bloc with no deal. Only then would the cowardly continentals yield. It is true that the EU wants a deal, because of the harm that Brexit without one would do. But the harm is asymmetric. In a no-deal scenario, the UK suffers more and, after a period of gratuitous pain, returns to negotiations with diminished leverage.

Opposition leaders have held a series of meetings in recent weeks to discuss how to prevent a no-deal Brexit \u2013 and have not ruled out a vote of no confidence in the government if Boris Johnson tries to force through a no-deal departure on 31 October. If Johnson loses, some MPs believe an alternative government could be formed, to extend article 50, and perhaps to trigger an EU referendum before calling a general election.

Several Labour MPs at Monday night\u2019s meeting of the parliamentary Labour party told Corbyn they would prefer a referendum to be held before a general election. That argument has previously been made by the deputy leader, Tom Watson, and the idea of attaching a \u201cconfirmatory\u201d referendum to any Brexit deal the prime minister secures from the EU27 is again being discussed. But the Labour leader has repeatedly rejected that idea. Opposition MPs and Conservative rebels banded together last month to pass the Benn Act, aimed at forcing Johnson to request a Brexit delay if he fails to pass a deal by 19 October. But the MPs have widely differing views about how that extension should be used \u2013 with some hoping Brexit can be reversed, and others that the time could be used to negotiate a deal.

      "bodyText": "Colombia\u2019s intelligence chief has resigned over a discredited dossier which supposedly proved that Venezuelan authorities were sheltering Colombian rebels, amid an escalating information war between the two neighbouring countries. The Colombian president, Iv\u00e1n Duque, brandished the file at the United Nations general assembly in New York last week, claiming that it was \u201cconclusive proof\u201d that Venezuela\u2019s president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, was harbouring Colombian guerrillas. Ample evidence has emerged to support Colombia\u2019s concerns; the presence of fighters from the National Liberation Army (ELN) has been reported hundreds of miles across the border, and the group is believed to be responsible for a string of massacres in rural Venezuela last October. But it soon emerged that Duque\u2019s dossier included years-old, uncredited press photos, which were actually taken in Colombia \u2013 not in Venezuela. Colombian officials dismissed the issue as a simple failure to credit sources, but late on Monday, the armed forces\u2019 intelligence chief, Gen Oswaldo Pe\u00f1a, resigned. In a letter to Duque, Pe\u00f1a claimed he was resigning for personal reasons, though made mention of the scandal. \u201cAs a general of the republic, I am conscious of the need to take responsibility for my actions and those of my subalterns, so am acting accordingly,\u201d he wrote. Diplomatic relations between Colombia and Venezuela have grown increasingly strained since Bogot\u00e1 backed Juan Guaid\u00f3, the Venezuelan opposition leader who has become the figurehead of opposition to Maduro. Chief among Colombia\u2019s criticisms of the Venezuelan president are accusations that he has sheltered Colombian leftist militias including the ELN and the now-demobilised Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (or Farc). Farc signed a peace deal with the Colombian government in 2016, but when two dissident rebel leaders announced in August that they were returning to war, Colombian officials claimed they were already in Venezuela. However, analysts say Colombia is shooting itself in the foot with its repeated blunders, especially after photographs emerged last month of Guaid\u00f3 posing with rightwing Colombian paramilitaries while crossing the border in February. \u201cIt sure seems like, through sheer carelessness, the Colombian government keeps handing undeserved propaganda victories to the Maduro regime,\u201d said Adam Isacson, a security analyst at the Washington Office on Latin America, a thinktank. \u201cUS, Colombian and Venezuelan non-governmental organizations and media outlets have already produced credible reports of Venezuelan cooperation with Colombian guerrilla groups,\u201d Isacson went on to say. \u201cThe Duque government\u2019s sloppiness is undercutting that narrative.\u201d Maduro\u2019s government also used its appearance at the UN to weaponize false information. Vice-President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez presented coordinates for what she described as camps inside Colombia where \u201cterrorists\u201d were plotting against Venezuela. But the local website Colombia Reports found that two of the coordinates were locations in the Caribbean sea, while the third appeared to be the front yard of a house in the Colombian city of Maicao.",

      "bodyText": "Describing the chancellor\u2019s speech as \u201chyperbole that crumbles under scrutiny\u201d is a kind way of making clear that it was nothing more than a cynical jumble of half-baked, half-true assertions (This party split the country. A cash splurge can\u2019t repair it, 1 October). We\u2019ve grown used to \u2013 but shouldn\u2019t accept \u2013 duplicity and hyperbole. Examples of misdirected but eye-catching spending include how the problems associated with social care, of quality, availability and cost, will not disappear as a result of a hospital-building programme. Communities cut off by swingeing cuts to public transport as a consequence of reductions in local authority funding that once used to subsidise such routes will not benefit from plans to upgrade roads \u2013 or the introduction of contactless payments on buses that don\u2019t run. Of course low-paid workers will benefit from significant increases in the national minimum wage, but such gains will disappear under the weight of fast-rising food and fuel bills as quickly as they emerged. Les Bright Exeter, Devon \u2022 Re your report (Javid takes aim at Labour marginal with target of \u00a310.50 national living wage, 1 October), the figure announced by Sajid Javid represents a rise of just 5% a year over five years. Worth a damp squib, not fanfare, when the Office for National Statistics says national wage inflation is 4%. Ritual moans from the Institute of Directors and British Chamber of Commerce should be read in the context of the tiny difference between these percentages. Alison Whitehouse London \u2022 In the post-election budget of 8 July 2015, George Osborne announced, for workers aged 25 and over, \u201ca new national living wage. We will set it to reach \u00a39 an hour by 2020.\u201d The current figure is \u00a38.21 and the Low Pay Commission \u201cforecast\u201d a rate of \u00a38.67 for April 2020. The \u00a39 figure has been quietly buried. Why should we believe the \u00a310.50 target for 2024 announced by Sajid Javid? In August, the Low Pay Commission recommended that in April 2021 the age for the national living wage be lowered from 25 to 23 (with a subsequent reduction to 21). Javid is now taking the credit for this. Dr Dave Lyddon Keele University \u2022 Will the Tories abolish high wages too? Sylvia Ackling High Kelling, Norfolk \u2022 Contrary to the view of the head of shows at the Three Counties Showground (Three tonnes of goods donated to food bank, 30 September), this is not \u201cgetting back to the real meaning of harvest\u201d. The Christian understanding is encapsulated in the hymn couplet \u201cfor a just and equal sharing, of the things that earth affords\u201d. Our local churches support our food bank, but while the demand for family parcels has nearly doubled in 12 months we cannot keep up with the need. The Labour party aims to eradicate the need for food banks within three years by ensuring a fairer share of our country\u2019s wealth. That is a proper expression of harvest. Rev David Haslam Evesham, Worcestershire \u2022 You rightly state in your leader (1 October) that universal credit is a \u201cstain on the Conservatives\u201d. In fact it is a cynical and manipulative misnomer, being neither universal nor giving much by way of credit to its many victims. For a benefit to be universal it must by definition apply to all, as in purportedly universal healthcare or education.

Johnson has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/29/boris-johnson-no-interest-to-declare-in-arcuri-firm\">insisted that \u201ceverything was done with full propriety\u201d</a> but repeatedly refused to go into detail on what help, if any, he gave to Arcuri.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Johnson refused three times to deny outright that he had an affair with Arcuri in an interview with Sky News. When pressed on whether he was denying an affair, he said: \u201cThe crucial thing is that in terms of promoting London, everything was done with complete propriety.\u201d</p> <p>The latest twist follows revelations that firms run by the entrepreneur \u2013 who is said to have confided in friends she was having an affair with Johnson \u2013 received \u00a3126,000 of public money. About \u00a311,500 of that figure was paid by L&amp;P to Innotech while Johnson was mayor and after Cuneo left the agency. Arcuri also went on three overseas trade missions led by Johnson, two of which she had initially been turned down for.</p> <p>The Sirius scheme, run by UK Trade and Investment (now the Department for International Trade), aimed to attract international entrepreneurs to set up businesses in Britain by providing visas, expert advice and mentorship, as well as a \u00a312,000 grant.</p> <p>According to evidence provided to the Guardian by a whistleblower, staff working on the Sirius programme warned Cuneo and other senior civil servants of a conflict of interest in June 2014 after Innotech was given \u00a310,000 by the scheme to run a launch event for the programme the month before before without any tendering process.</p> <p>Staff were concerned that the programme team failed to follow procurement rules and warned there was a conflict of interest with the Sirius scheme paying the startup because it was already a recipient of the visa scheme.</p> <p>Speaking this week, the whistleblower accused Cuneo of showing favouritism towards Innotech and questioned the company\u2019s suitability for a place on the programme given it was simply an events firm rather than developing a product.</p> <p>The whistleblower, who worked on the Sirius scheme at the time, told the Guardian: \u201cI regarded the two decisions about Innotech [on the visa and the subsequent launch event contract] as examples of favouritism.\u201d</p> <p>Innotech was the only company admitted in the first wave of Sirius startups that did not have a tech product, the whistleblower said.</p> <p>\u201cIt was fundamentally an event company. In that sense, Innotech stood out compared to other startups in the programme, which had a much higher potential to scale up. Potential to scale was one of the criteria we adopted to evaluate applicants.</p> <p>\u201cThis is significant because admission to the Sirius programme involved a tier 1 entrepreneur visa, plus a grant of \u00a312,000, plus additional support resources.\u201d</p> <p>The whistleblower said that after Innotech was admitted, Cuneo decided to give the firm an extra \u00a310,000 to organise a launch event for the Sirius programme.</p> <p>\u201cSeveral members of the team raised concerns about that decision, because it seemed not to follow standard procurement rules and because there was a clear conflict of interest (as we had already funded this startup). There were concerns because those services were procured without opening up the tender to competition and because the invoicing seemed to be irregular. On top of that, we already had a supplier for event management, so this seemed like a duplication.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"abd471fd6e3a574a258bad3536b9811b30110215\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/abd471fd6e3a574a258bad3536b9811b30110215/0_330_4946_2967/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Arcuri and Cuneo at the Innotech Sirius programme launch.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arcuri and Cuneo at the Innotech Sirius programme launch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Clarke</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cuneo was the director of the Sirius programme from May 2013 until August 2016, boasting on Linkedin that she \u201cdesigned, launched and ran the programme from its inception including business cases approval, suppliers and stakeholders management, team leadership\u201d.

      "bodyText": "A Whitehall official who ran the scheme that granted Jennifer Arcuri a coveted entrepreneur visa had worked for Boris Johnson when he was mayor, the Guardian has learned. The US businesswoman, who is at the centre of a conflict of interest row over her friendship with the prime minister, beat nearly 2,000 applicants to gain one of 200 sought-after tier 1 entrepreneur visas on the government\u2019s Sirius programme after Johnson helped promote her firm, Innotech, by giving keynote speeches at her events. The Guardian has learned that Paola Cuneo, the then director of the Sirius programme, previously spent two-and-a-half years working in a senior post at London &amp; Partners (L&amp;P), the official mayoral promotional agency which Johnson had responsibility for while he was in City Hall. Cuneo, Arcuri and Johnson attended the same Innotech event in October 2013, two months before the company joined the Sirius scheme. A whistleblower told the Guardian: \u201cInnotech stood out compared to other startups in the programme, which had a much higher potential to scale up \u2026 I could not understand why we were giving so much attention and extra funds to Innotech.\u201d Ten days after the news of Johnson\u2019s relationship with Arcuri broke, the new disclosures will intensify speculation over a possible conflict of interest and raise fresh questions for the prime minister over whether he played an improper role in securing government support for his friend. Johnson has insisted that \u201ceverything was done with full propriety\u201d but repeatedly refused to go into detail on what help, if any, he gave to Arcuri. On Tuesday, Johnson refused three times to deny outright that he had an affair with Arcuri in an interview with Sky News. When pressed on whether he was denying an affair, he said: \u201cThe crucial thing is that in terms of promoting London, everything was done with complete propriety.\u201d The latest twist follows revelations that firms run by the entrepreneur \u2013 who is said to have confided in friends she was having an affair with Johnson \u2013 received \u00a3126,000 of public money. About \u00a311,500 of that figure was paid by L&amp;P to Innotech while Johnson was mayor and after Cuneo left the agency. Arcuri also went on three overseas trade missions led by Johnson, two of which she had initially been turned down for. The Sirius scheme, run by UK Trade and Investment (now the Department for International Trade), aimed to attract international entrepreneurs to set up businesses in Britain by providing visas, expert advice and mentorship, as well as a \u00a312,000 grant. According to evidence provided to the Guardian by a whistleblower, staff working on the Sirius programme warned Cuneo and other senior civil servants of a conflict of interest in June 2014 after Innotech was given \u00a310,000 by the scheme to run a launch event for the programme the month before before without any tendering process. Staff were concerned that the programme team failed to follow procurement rules and warned there was a conflict of interest with the Sirius scheme paying the startup because it was already a recipient of the visa scheme. Speaking this week, the whistleblower accused Cuneo of showing favouritism towards Innotech and questioned the company\u2019s suitability for a place on the programme given it was simply an events firm rather than developing a product. The whistleblower, who worked on the Sirius scheme at the time, told the Guardian: \u201cI regarded the two decisions about Innotech [on the visa and the subsequent launch event contract] as examples of favouritism.\u201d Innotech was the only company admitted in the first wave of Sirius startups that did not have a tech product, the whistleblower said. \u201cIt was fundamentally an event company. In that sense, Innotech stood out compared to other startups in the programme, which had a much higher potential to scale up. Potential to scale was one of the criteria we adopted to evaluate applicants. \u201cThis is significant because admission to the Sirius programme involved a tier 1 entrepreneur visa, plus a grant of \u00a312,000, plus additional support resources.\u201d The whistleblower said that after Innotech was admitted, Cuneo decided to give the firm an extra \u00a310,000 to organise a launch event for the Sirius programme. \u201cSeveral members of the team raised concerns about that decision, because it seemed not to follow standard procurement rules and because there was a clear conflict of interest (as we had already funded this startup). There were concerns because those services were procured without opening up the tender to competition and because the invoicing seemed to be irregular. On top of that, we already had a supplier for event management, so this seemed like a duplication.\u201d Cuneo was the director of the Sirius programme from May 2013 until August 2016, boasting on Linkedin that she \u201cdesigned, launched and ran the programme from its inception including business cases approval, suppliers and stakeholders management, team leadership\u201d. The profile describes her role on the programme judging panel \u201creviewing a number of global applications for their assessment against key criteria as part of the panel of judges\u201d. Prior to that, she served as head of L&amp;P for Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia and Pacific from 2009-11 while Johnson was mayor in City Hall where he served from 2008-16. Cuneo attended at least two Innotech events in 2014, including one at the House of Commons. In an Innotech promotional video recorded after she spoke at a joint Sirius/Innotech event, she said: \u201cI think today was amazing, so inspiring. It was great to have representation from the VC world, the corporate world, the startups, the accelerators. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone out of our way all over the world [to] select the best talents and we put them into the UK, which as we\u2019ve heard today is a pretty amazing place to be an entrepreneur.\u201d She also sent a number of supportive tweets about Arcuri, writing to her in October 2015 saying: \u201cYou nailed it.\u201d More recently, in 2016, Cuneo wrote that she was \u201cvery proud\u201d of Arcuri. The whistleblower added: \u201cBefore leading the Sirius programme, Cuneo was holding a senior position at London &amp; Partners.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson is overseeing a political strategy similar to Donald Trump, the former Tory minister David Gauke has said, as he warned the Conservatives not to descend down a path of populism. The former justice secretary, who lost the whip after voting to stop a no-deal Brexit, voiced his frustration with the prime minister\u2019s strategy, which he said was \u201cTrumpian\u201d in terms of the type of language being used and the overall tone of debate. A divisive Downing Street, briefings using the phrase \u201ccollaborator\u201d and riling up party activists all belong to a strategy that \u201ccorresponds more to Trump than to the long tradition of the Conservatives and Winston Churchill\u201d, he told the Guardian. Gauke is no longer able to stand as a Conservative MP, alongside 20 other rebels who were kicked out of the parliamentary Tory party for voting for the Benn Act, which stops a no-deal Brexit and compels Johnson to extend article 50 if he cannot strike a deal, and to pass it through parliament by 19 October. Several members of the group, including the former chancellor Philip Hammond, are being investigated by Downing Street, which alleges they worked with foreign powers to draft the legislation. Gauke said the announcement of that investigation, which featured on the front page of the Mail on Sunday, was full of \u201cTrumpian overtones\u201d \u2013 primarily \u201cbecause it\u2019s not true\u201d. Those overtones included \u201cthe sense that anybody who disagrees is unpatriotic and betrays the country\u201d, he said. \u201cThe attacks on the judiciary are views more in the tradition of Trump and it\u2019s not something Margaret Thatcher would do. She was a radical prime minister but she was a great defender of our national institutions.\u201d Gauke hopes to stand again for South West Hertfordshire, but will have to do so as an independent. Comparing Johnson and Trump, he said: \u201cThey are very different personalities but in terms of political strategy, because of what we see from No 10 is divisive and exercising the base and that is very similar to Donald Trump.\u201d Despite their expulsion from the party, many of the Tory rebels attended this week\u2019s conference.

The pair were recently spotted enjoying an evening out at the <a href=\"https://the-crystal-maze.com/london-westend/\" title=\"\">Crystal Maze Live Experience</a> in London, where they locked eyes as Skepta alluringly filled small bowls with sand to release a crystal, and Adele roared, \u201cStart the fans, please!\u201d so loudly that the dome shattered into a thousand pieces \u2026 well, something like that, anyway.</p> <p>But is an immersive experience inspired by a 90s TV show really the ideal place for romance? Naturally, I went along \u2013 without a date \u2013 to find out.</p> <p>My first impression is that this may have been the hopeless place Rihanna was singing about: the experience is located in perhaps the least amorous part of London, Piccadilly Circus. There may be a statue of Eros in the street, but, on a Tuesday lunchtime at least, it\u2019s 10% buskers, 90% Italian schoolchildren.

      "bodyText": "In entirely random, but nevertheless heartwarming news, two of Tottenham\u2019s most famous faces, Adele and Skepta, are reportedly dating. The pair were recently spotted enjoying an evening out at the Crystal Maze Live Experience in London, where they locked eyes as Skepta alluringly filled small bowls with sand to release a crystal, and Adele roared, \u201cStart the fans, please!\u201d so loudly that the dome shattered into a thousand pieces \u2026 well, something like that, anyway. But is an immersive experience inspired by a 90s TV show really the ideal place for romance? Naturally, I went along \u2013 without a date \u2013 to find out. My first impression is that this may have been the hopeless place Rihanna was singing about: the experience is located in perhaps the least amorous part of London, Piccadilly Circus. There may be a statue of Eros in the street, but, on a Tuesday lunchtime at least, it\u2019s 10% buskers, 90% Italian schoolchildren. Inside, though, it seems this could have date potential; no one in my eight-strong group (two of whom, curiously, have never seen the TV show) looks too bad in the trademark red bomber jacket.

But after a picture-perfect parade was beamed around the world from Beijing, the one part of the country that is not under his full control ripped up the playbook, with the people of Hong Kong pouring on to the streets to challenge Xi\u2019s vision for China. By mid-afternoon in Hong Kong an 18-year-old student had been shot point blank in the chest by a policeman, swathes of the city were engulfed in violent chaos and Beijing\u2019s militaristic anniversary celebrations had been swept from international headlines. \u201cThis was meant to be such a celebration but it\u2019s really a PR disaster,\u201d said Louisa Lim, a senior lecturer at the University of Melbourne and author of The People\u2019s Republic of Amnesia, a book about the 1989 protests against the Chinese government. She pointed out that as the streets of Hong Kong filled with teargas, water cannon and smoke and flames from the fires lit by protesters, senior leaders in Beijing were filing into a gala dinner. Among them was Carrie Lam, the chief executive of Hong Kong. \u201cIt makes China\u2019s leaders look so heartless, watching violinists and fireworks and here the people of Hong Kong are demonstrating for their lives, and a kid is in hospital,\u201d said Lim. \u201cIt really is a split screen.\u201d Individually the teachers, logistics workers, retirees, students and others who came out to demonstrate have very little power beyond the right to protest; under Hong Kong law they cannot even choose their own leader in elections. But together they represent perhaps the biggest challenge yet to Xi, risking injury and arrest to denounce his \u201cChina dream\u201d as a sham, expose the fragility of his claim to national unity, and fight for a different future. China\u2019s approach to National Day celebrations in Beijing and Hong Kong underscored how hampered the leadership is in its approach to tackling a popular uprising. The party has years of practice at central planning, propaganda messaging and bruising political control, and almost no experience responding to popular pressure. That meant details of the triumphant parade through Beijing were so meticulously planned that residents along the route were forced to move out and guidelines painted on to the road to ensure each inch driven by Xi\u2019s limousine would be in perfect formation.

plant <strong>if</strong> Britain leaves the EU without a deal.</p> <p>If Sunderland lost the Qashqai contract, it could lead to the eventual closure of the site, the FT fears.</p> <p>Here\u2019s a flavour of their story:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Japanese carmaker pledged in November 2016 to build the SUV in the UK, safeguarding thousands of jobs, after its then chairman Carlos Ghosn received assurances from the government that its operations would be protected from the impact of Brexit.</p> <p>But following last year\u2019s ousting of Mr Ghosn and a collapse in profits, Nissan has undertaken a global review that makes everything including the Sunderland plant vulnerable to downsizing or closure.</p> <p>The carmaker\u2019s decision to manufacture in the UK was contingent on a \u201csoft\u201d Brexit that includes a trade deal or transition arrangement, a decision that it would reassess if Britain leaves the EU without any deal, according to two people familiar with its original investment decision. <br></p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ft4s/status/1179005147638325254\">  <blockquote

It would also be the worst year since the financial crisis a decade ago.</p> <p>For 2020, the WTO has cut its forecast to 2.7% growth, from 3.0%.

      "bodyText": "Finally, here\u2019s our news story on the WTO\u2019s warning of a trade slowdown. Stocks have fallen on both sides of the Atlantic after the closely-watched ISM survey of US factories hit its lowest level in a decade. Europe\u2019s main indices all closed in the red, with the FTSE 100 down 47 points or 0.65% at 7,360. Fashion group Burberry (-3%), Royal Bank of Scotland (-2.9%) and mining giant Glencore (-2.7%) were all among the top fallers. France\u2019s CAC shed 1.4%, while Germany\u2019s DAX closed 1.3% lower. Wall Street is taking a bath too, with the Dow Jones industrial average down 259 points or almost 1%. Here\u2019s the chart that has worried investors: The slowdown in world trade forecast by the WTO today shows that life after Brexit won\u2019t be easy. Ursula Johnston, head of customs at law firm, Gowling WLG, explains: The recent WTO trade forecasts indicate a fairly significant slowdown in the rate of growth of global trade. The UK should consider that when outside the safety net of the EU single market and European customs union, peddling UK goods and services to the rest of the world will not be plain sailing. In particular the UK\u2019s exposure to large scale trade conflicts will certainly begin to bite. Here\u2019s Ana Nicholls, Industry Director at The Economist Intelligence Unit, in the no-deal Brexit threat to Nissan\u2019s Sunderland car plant: Nissan will have no choice but to review its plans for Sunderland if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. Toyota and others will review their production plans too. About 80% of the Sunderland plant\u2019s output is exported and a similar share of components are imported, mostly to and from the EU. The no-deal Brexit could well disrupt that supply chain; as well as complicating paperwork and logistics, it would also add tariffs of 10% for cars and 4.5% for parts. America\u2019s factories are clearly suffering from the trade war, and the slowdown in the eurozone isn\u2019t helping either. This looks bad - US factory activity had fallen at the fastest rate in a decade, accordingly to the ISM\u2019s September health check. Its US manufacturing PMI has dropped to 47.8, further away from the 50-point mark separating growth from contraction. Time for a quick recap of the main points. The WTO has slashed its forecast for global trade, in the face of US-China tensions and Brexit. It now predicts goods trade will only rise by 1.2%, down from 3% last year. UK factories are slashing jobs at the fastest rate since early 2013, as the manufacturing slowdown continues. Output, new orders and exports all fell, but some factories are benefitting from a new bout of Brexit stock-piling. Europe\u2019s factory sector is also struggling, with sharp output drops in Germany, Italy and Sweden last month. Uncertainty over Britain\u2019s exit from the EU is also hitting the housing market. House prices fell by 0.2% in September, the Nationwide building society says, with sharp falls in and around London. High street bakers Greggs has revealed that its Brexit contingency plans (mentioned earlier) includes changing some of its recipes. Bloomberg has the details: If there are any disruptions at ports, \u201cwe\u2019ll be able to last a few days and then hopefully it will settle down,\u201d chief executive Roger Whiteside said on a call with reporters as the company reported a slowdown in sales growth that prompted a fall in the shares. \u201cShould there be any short-term pressures on some ingredients then there are alternative recipe suggestions we can fall back to.\u201d Greggs has already tried to reduce its dependency on European suppliers, sourcing more of its cheese and sugar from U.K.-based companies. It has also brought forward purchases of trucks from continental Europe to limit the effect of any delays at the borders on its own distribution network. \u201cA lot of what we sell clearly has a level of substitution involved,\u201d Whiteside said. \u201cPeople won\u2019t go without food. They\u2019ll make different food choices dependent on what\u2019s available.\u201d Just in: A no-deal Brexit would increase the risk that Japanese carmaker Nissan closes its Sunderland car plant. The Financial Times is reporting that Nissan will review its decision to build the Qashqai sport utility vehicle at its Sunderland plant if Britain leaves the EU without a deal. If Sunderland lost the Qashqai contract, it could lead to the eventual closure of the site, the FT fears. Here\u2019s a flavour of their story: The Japanese carmaker pledged in November 2016 to build the SUV in the UK, safeguarding thousands of jobs, after its then chairman Carlos Ghosn received assurances from the government that its operations would be protected from the impact of Brexit. But following last year\u2019s ousting of Mr Ghosn and a collapse in profits, Nissan has undertaken a global review that makes everything including the Sunderland plant vulnerable to downsizing or closure. The carmaker\u2019s decision to manufacture in the UK was contingent on a \u201csoft\u201d Brexit that includes a trade deal or transition arrangement, a decision that it would reassess if Britain leaves the EU without any deal, according to two people familiar with its original investment decision. Here\u2019s a handy couple of charts showing how trade growth, and the expanding Chinese economy, have risen hand in hand. There\u2019s a major shake-up under way at the John Lewis Partnership. One in three senior management HQ jobs are being cut, as it effectively merges the running of its supermarkets (Waitrose) and department stores (John Lewis). More here: Some good news: Belfast shipyard Harland and Wolff has been saved from closure, by a London-based energy firm. My colleague Rob Davies explains: The historic shipyard went into administration in August after its Norwegian parent company collapsed. But InfraStrata, which works on projects such as the Islandmagee underground gas storage plant off the coast of Country Antrim, said it planned to retain the 79 staff still employed at the yard and potentially employ hundreds more. The Unite union praised the company\u2019s workers for fighting to keep it alive, including a nine-week sit-in protest that was designed to raise awareness about its plight. The WTO has also provided these charts, which show clearly that trade growth has levelled out since summer 2018 -- when Donald Trump imposed the first tranche of tariffs on China. Here are the key points from the WTO\u2019s new trade forecasts, which are rather gloomier than three months ago: World merchandise trade volume is forecast to grow 1.2% in 2019. This is substantially below the 2.6% trade growth that had been projected in April. Trade volume growth should accelerate slightly to 2.7% in 2020 while global GDP growth holds steady at 2.3% (at market exchange rates), but this depends on an easing of trade tensions. Trade conflicts pose the biggest downside risk to the forecast but macroeconomic shocks and financial volatility are also potential triggers for a steeper downturn. Trade-related indicators signal a worrying trajectory for world trade based on global export orders and economic policy uncertainty. Export and import growth slowed across all regions and at all levels of development in the first half of 2019. The World Trade Organisation has slashed its forecast for global trade growth to its lowest in a decade, and Brexit is partly to blame. In a warning sign to businesses, and governments around the globe, the WTO predicted that global merchandise trade will only increase by 1.2% this year, compared with its April estimate of 2.6%. That would be a serious slowdown, as trade grew by 3.0% in 2018. It would also be the worst year since the financial crisis a decade ago. For 2020, the WTO has cut its forecast to 2.7% growth, from 3.0%. It also cautioned that these forecasts are laden with \u201cdownside risks\u201d It cited the weakening global economy, the ongoing trade dispute between China and America, and Brexit-related uncertainty. WTO Director-General Roberto Azevedo warned that: \u201cThe darkening outlook for trade is discouraging but not unexpected. Beyond their direct effects, trade conflicts heighten uncertainty, which is leading some businesses to delay the productivity-enhancing investments that are essential to raising living standards. Less trade means fewer jobs. As Azev\u00eado puts it: \u201cJob creation may also be hampered as firms employ fewer workers to produce goods and services for export.\u201d Brexit stockpiling might give factories a short-term boost, but it\u2019s not very good for the economy as a whole. It means that firms are holding onto more raw materials than they\u2019d like, tying up precious capital that could be used more productively elsewhere. It also distracts from longer-term planning. Lee Collinson, head of manufacturing at Barclays, explains: Some parts of the sector have started to build up inventories again as the 31st October Brexit deadline looms large. The knock-on effect is that this activity is diverting valuable funds away from much-needed investment projects. To make matters worse, a growing global economic slowdown is increasingly casting a shadow over the sector coupled with reports that some EU-based clients are moving supply chains away from the UK. There\u2019s another problem with stockpiling - you literally have to put the stuff somewhere. Last week, Bloomberg\u2019s Lucy Meakin spoke to a fruit crisp manufacturer who bought 24 tonnes (!) of beetroot ahead of the original Brexit deadline in March. That meant paying for expensive refrigerated storage, which they\u2019d rather not do again. Stephen Cooper, Head of Industrial Manufacturing at KPMG UK, says today\u2019s UK manufacturing PMI report is pretty bad. Firms should check they have enough working capital to ride out the slowdown, he warns, saying; \u201cWe expected grim news from this month\u2019s UK Manufacturing PMI readings and that unfortunately came to fruition, albeit with marginal improvement on last month\u2019s performance. \u201cA backdrop of global trade wars, Brexit uncertainty and concerns regarding the slowing global economic growth continue to weigh heavily on the industry, with Europe, our leading trading partner, far from immune. Indeed Europe posted their worst performance since October 2012. \u201cLower orders for new work, job losses and reduced investment levels due to prolonged uncertainty paints a rather bleak set of conditions which are unlikely to abate any time soon. This reinforces the importance for manufacturers to ensure that their working capital and supply chains are as robust as possible to weather these challenging times.\u201d Steve Harris of Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking says some UK factories are focused on short-term Brexit problems, rather than looking further ahead: \u201cShort-term Brexit headwinds continue to dominate domestically, but it is clear that weaker international demand and trade wars globally are impacting on growth. The danger remains this causes manufacturers to hold back investment and become myopic losing sight of medium and long-term growth opportunities. Encouragingly, anecdotal feedback and our own research suggests this isn\u2019t happening everywhere, but that doesn\u2019t remove the fact resources are being applied to short-term planning to tackle the immediate challenges. More reaction: Rob Dobson, Director at IHS Markit, fears that the UK manufacturing sector is sliding into recession. Here\u2019s his take on today\u2019s PMI report: Output, new orders and employment all fell further as rising political, trade and economic uncertainties exacerbated concerns about Brexit. \u201cThe rate of job losses accelerated to a six-and-a- half-year high, highlighting how manufacturers are increasingly seeking to cut costs. Similarly, the investment goods sector was especially hard hit in September, seeing the sharpest drops in production and new business, as clients reined in capital spending while conditions remained volatile. Newsflash: UK factories are cutting jobs at the fastest pace in six years, despite getting a boost from Brexit stockpiling. Data firm Markit reports that output shrank again last month, as the downturn at British manufacturing continues. Bosses reported that output, new orders, and new export business all fell further in September. Employment levels also declined, at the fastest pace since February 2013. Markit says: Companies reported that capacity had been reduced due to lower demand, efforts to control costs, redundancies and natural wastage. Job losses were widespread across the sector, with declines seen across the consumer, intermediate and investment goods industries and at SMEs and large-sized producers. Economic uncertainty, the weak European economy, and the trade war between Washington and Beijing all appear to be hurting the UK\u2019s industrial base. But there are also signs that companies are preparing for the looming Brexit deadline. Stocks of purchases and input buying volumes also rose for the first time in recent months, as some companies restarted their preparations for Britain to leave the EU. This lifted the manufacturing PMI up to 48.3 in September, from August\u2019s six-and-a-half year low of 47.4. The most remarkable story of the morning is that the chief operating officer of Credit Suisse has resigned, over a spying operation against the bank\u2019s own outgoing head of wealth management. My colleague Julia Kollewe explains: Switzerland\u2019s second-biggest bank said Pierre-Olivier Bou\u00e9e has stepped down after private detectives were hired to tail Iqbal Khan, the bank\u2019s former head of wealth management. An investigation into the scandal by the Homburger law firm on behalf of the board cleared Tidjane Thiam, Credit Suisse\u2019s chief executive, and found that Bou\u00e9e alone was responsible for the botched surveillance of Khan, who left in July and later joined arch-rival UBS. The surveillance led to a confrontation in the streets of Zurich last month between Khan and the private detectives. The decision to put Khan under surveillance is quite astonishing, and obviously backfired when Khan spotted he was being spied on. CS may have worried that he could poach bankers and clients for UBS - where he starts work today! But even though Thaim has been cleared, the affair does raise questions about his leadership. He and Khan had what the FT calls an \u201cacrimonious relationship\u201d, due to a series of domestic rows over their adjoining properties in Zurich. One such spat apparently centred on some trees planted on the Thaim residence... Ouch! The slump in the eurozone\u2019s manufacturing sector has deepened, hit by the US-China trade war and Brexit. Data firm Markit has reported that factory output and new orders both fell sharply again last month. This dragged its Eurozone Manufacturing PMI down to 45.7, from 47.0 in August and its lowest reading since October 2012. Anything below 50 shows contraction, and such a weak reading suggests the eurozone is weakening. Germany suffered particularly badly, with the weakest PMI in 123 months. Italy, Spain and Austria also suffered contractions. Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit said: \u201cThe health of the eurozone manufacturing sector went from bad to worse in September, with the PMI survey indicating the steepest downturn for nearly seven years and sending increasingly grim signals for the fourth quarter..... Businesses also remain downbeat about the year ahead, with optimism around a seven-year low amid trade war worries, signs of slowing global economic growth and geopolitical concerns, including heightened anxiety over a disruptive Brexit. High street bakery chain Greggs says it\u2019s taking steps to prevent disruption from a no-deal Brexit. Greggs told shareholders this morning that: We are preparing for the potential impact of the UK\u2019s departure from the European Union by building stocks of key ingredients and equipment that could be affected by disruption to the flow of goods into the UK. Britons are already worried about disruption to key medicines after a disorderly Brexit, without the added threat of running low on steak bakes and vegan sausage rolls. In a trading update, Greggs also warned that its labour and food input costs are being pushed up. But it is pressing on with its autumn range, including the popular Pumpkin Spice Latte, and some new post-4pm meal deals (including pizza and a drink for \u00a32). If people aren\u2019t moving house, then they\u2019re not buying new carpets and furniture. Sofas and carpets firm SCS has warned that its sales are down 7.6% in the last two months, partly down to Brexit. The period has been impacted by the record temperatures seen over the key August bank holiday weekend and the increased political and economic uncertainty that the UK is currently facing. Share in SCS have fallen 7% in early trading. Britain\u2019s house price slowdown is firmly centred on London, as this map shows: Guy Harrington, CEO of property lender Glenhawk, blames Brexit for the slowdown in house price growth: If these were \u2018normal\u2019 times, we\u2019d expect the favourable underlying drivers of low interest rates and high employment to be supporting a buoyant market. However these are unprecedented times and the record that is playing housing growth is stuck until the needle bounces over the Brexit bump, although that assumes that\u2019s all it is.\u201d Lucy Pendleton of independent estate agents James Pendleton points out that house prices have been lagging inflation for over a year: \u201cSuch low growth means September is set to be the 14th month in a row in which property has lost value in real terms. \u201cThe last time growth even equalled CPI was in July 2018 when both measures were running at 2.5% year on year. The last time the property market was ahead was in April 2018. \u201cWhat this means is that there\u2019s no mistaking this trend as a flash in the pan and it is being solidly reflected in buyer and vendor behaviour, particularly in London. Jonathan Samuels, CEO of property lender Octane Capital, fears that the housing market will weaken in the months ahead: \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle that the market is holding up as well as it is given the level of political turmoil. Low supply and stock levels continue to support prices while cheap mortgages and the strong jobs market are steeling buyers\u2019 resolve. The resilience of the property market looks set to be tested like never before in the final quarter of 2019. \u201cTo say it\u2019s tin hat time is an understatement.\u201d Iain McKenzie, CEO of the Guild of Property Professionals, reckons the housing market will pick up once Brexit is resolved. When the extension of Brexit was announced there was a spike in activity in the market, which again reiterates the fact that it is uncertainty holding buyers back rather than a lack of interest. Once activity starts to increase and buyer confidence returns, which it will, prices will start back on an upward trajectory.\u201d Weak house price growth is obviously good news for those hoping to get onto the housing ladder. But despite the slowdown, houses are still relatively unaffordable, as this chart shows: This would obviously get worse if the Bank of England raised interest rates - although they\u2019re more likely to cut them in the current climate. London\u2019s housing market is leading the downturn, with prices sliding by 1.7% year-on-year in the last quarter, Nationwide reports. Prices in the \u2018Outer Metropolitan\u2019 region also fell, by 1.5%, reflecting the impact of Brexit uncertainty on the capital. Northern Ireland, though, has seen house price surge by 3.4% in the last year. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. With just 30 days until Brexit, the UK housing market is being dragged down by uncertainty and worry. House prices fell by 0.2% in September, according to new figures from Nationwide. This pulled the average property price down to \u00a3215,352, from \u00a3216,096 in August. Over the last year, prices have only risen by 0.2%, well behind inflation (1.7%) and pay (+4%). And there\u2019s a clear decline in the south, with London and the South East bearing the brunt. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, blames two factors -- the weakening global economy, and the ongoing Brexit saga. \u201cUK annual house price growth almost ground to a halt in September, at just 0.2%. This marks the tenth month in a row in which annual price growth has been below 1%. \u201cIndicators of UK economic activity have been fairly volatile in recent quarters, but the underlying pace of growth appears to have slowed as a result of weaker global growth and an intensification of Brexit uncertainty. However, the slowdown has centred on business investment \u2013 household spending has been more resilient, supported by steady gains in employment and real earnings. As these charts show, house price inflation has been dropping steadily since the UK voted to leave the EU: More to follow! Also coming up today We could get more grim news from Britain\u2019s factory sector this morning. September\u2019s manufacturing PMI report is expected to show that output shrank again across the UK last month. The eurozone\u2019s factories also probably suffered a torrid month, hit by recession worries and the US-China trade war. The agenda 9am BST: Eurozone manufacturing PMI - expected to fall to 45.6, from 47 in August, showing a deeper contraction 9.30am BST: UK manufacturing PMI - expected to fall to 47, from 47.4, showing a deeper contraction 3pm BST: US manufacturing PMI - expect to rise to 51, from 50.3, showing a little growth",

It\u2019s a special thing to be a part of, but we\u2019re all after the same thing and that\u2019s trying to win. \u201cIn sailing we only get one spot per nation and there\u2019s only one representative per class,\u201d he went on. \u201cWe\u2019re an incredibly strong sailing team and the second or in some classes the third guy in the pecking order are capable of winning medals on the world stage. \u201cSo no one gets complacent but equally you need to be able to take a year to focus on one event and get everything in order. Which is why the selection committee and the sailors are always so keen to gain that spot a year out.\u201d Scott has a busy year ahead as he will also compete in the Americas Cup as part of Ineos Team UK. He admits it will be something of a \u201cbalancing act\u201d but believes more success is possible. \u201cI need to make sure that I pay enough attention to each area of my sailing, but it is very doable and it\u2019s been done in the past to great success,\u201d he said. Team GB sailors Giles Scott (men\u2019s Finn); Hannah Mills and Eilidh McIntyre (470 women); Luke Patience and Chris Grube (470 men); Charlotte Dobson and Saskia Tidey (49er FX women); Dylan Fletcher and Stuart Bithell (49er men); Alison Young (Laser Radial women); Emma Wilson (RS: X Women); Tom Squires (RS: X men)",

      "bodyText": "Labour\u2019s selection process for a new metro mayor has been plunged into acrimony after a leaked email showed that the shadow minister Naz Shah has accused a prospective candidate of being unfit for office. Shah, the shadow minister for women and equalities, is demanding that Salma Yaqoob should not be allowed to stand as mayoral candidate for the West Midlands. Shah claims Yaqoob should stand down because she ran a \u201cdespicable\u201d general election campaign against her in Bradford West two years ago. Yaqoob, a former Birmingham councillor backed by Momentum\u2019s leader, Jon Lansman, hit back, saying that Shah has refused to accept her public apology for standing as a Respect candidate, and is instead recycling vexatious claims. The row has been ignited after Labour\u2019s national executive committee (NEC) gave Yaqoob permission to oppose the MP Liam Byrne and unions\u2019 favourite, Pete Lowe, in the race to be selected as the party\u2019s official candidate to take on the West Midlands Conservative mayor, Andy Street. Shah has written to the NEC this week claiming Yaqoob endorsed a campaign of misogyny, patriarchy and clan politics in 2017. Shah claimed she was driven to contemplate suicide after Yaqoob\u2019s campaign exploited patriarchal politics, or biradri, among the city\u2019s Kashmiri and Pakistani community. \u201cThis kind of clan politics, not underpinned by any political ideology but driven by men for the purpose of men to gain and retain power, has hindered the development of my city,\u201d she said. \u201cDespite giving me her word that she wouldn\u2019t come to Bradford West after I explained this to her in detail, SY [Salma Yaqoob] still came and stood against me. In doing so I believe she endorsed misogyny, patriarchy and biradri politics. \u201cIf that wasn\u2019t a betrayal enough by a Muslim woman who I once looked up to, SY then allowed a local imam at her campaign launch to \u2018hijab shame\u2019 me. \u2018Who is the most Muslim, that is Salma Yaqoob,\u2019 were his words whilst SY sat there and applauded,\u201d she said. Shah claimed that Yaqoob\u2019s campaign exploited Shah\u2019s unconventional background \u2013 a divorcee raised on benefits by a single parent with a mother who was imprisoned for killing a man who had abused her \u2013 to win votes. \u201cI feel that SY used my backstory to literally dishonour me, making me \u2018unworthy\u2019 within the community. She did this in full knowledge of the cultural dynamics of honour, patriarchy and misogyny,\u201d Shah said. \u201cTo be questioned whether I was good enough by a bunch of patriarchal men, the misogynists in my community, in public, putting my character on trial for the sake of political gain with not a single word of condemnation but applause from SY is despicable,\u201d she said. Shah, who included recorded clips of Yaqoob from 2017 in her submission, claimed the campaign drove her to consider suicide. \u201cThis personal attack on my honour and everything I stood for \u2026 made me feel suicidal on two occasions during that campaign,\u201d she said. In the email, the MP for Bradford West has accused her own party of giving Yaqoob \u201cspecial treatment\u201d so she could stand to become a metro mayor. Labour sources insist the party went through the proper processes and Yaqoob\u2019s candidacy was waved through because there were no other women or BAME candidates. Approached for a comment, Yaqoob denied ever exploiting Shah\u2019s background, adding that it was \u201cdisturbing and manipulative\u201d to say so. Yaqoob said she had consistently campaigned against the clan system and did not try to shame anyone. She said in a statement: \u201cI would like to move forward in this campaign by recognising the problems of the past, honouring the pain felt on all sides and building collective support to deliver the very best for the people of the West Midlands under the Labour party. \u201cI have always had an open-door policy and have not shied from taking constructive criticisms on board. I would like the opportunity for Naz to see the journey I have been on over the last couple of years, perhaps this is something that I can only demonstrate through actions rather than words.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 2 October 2019. Salma Yaqoob is no longer a Birmingham city councillor. She served on the council between 2006 and 2011.",

But for me, as a young black American singer, she inspired me and gave me belief and hope that I could be successful too. As an established singer, I met her several times. She invited me to give a recital at the school she helped set up \u2013 the Jessye Norman School of the Arts in her home town of Augusta, Georgia.</p> <p>Over dinner I discovered that she had been following my career, and even knew which show I was in. We kept in touch and she continued to watch and support me. She was at a stage in her life when she didn\u2019t need to pay it forward, but she did, always. She was effusive in her compliments and really cared about me. She wanted to encourage me and my peers and see us succeed.</p> <p>She was undeniably a big personality, a magnetic and strong presence on stage. She was one of the last remaining divas, a very bold singer who brought commitment and charisma to everything she did. She was one of the greatest of her generation in German repertoire, but what I love about her was that as a musician she simply wanted to communicate. She dealt with racism, and she talked about people not wanting to give her her dues, but she was extremely resilient and focused. She let her voice speak for her.</p> <p><strong>\u2018She wasn\u2019t going to let anyone stop her\u2019<br></strong><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jul/03/judith-weir-master-of-the-queens-music-candidate\">Judith Weir</a>, composer</em><strong><br></strong>We worked together on a song cycle, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2000/aug/01/artsfeatures.mayaangelou\">woman.life.song</a>, that was at the Proms in 2000. It\u2019s a project she dreamed up and was very intimately involved in the nitty gritty of shaping over the several years it took to develop. I remember she would send me very businesslike but charming faxes \u2013 now alas too faded to read. I wish I\u2019d photographed them.</p> <p>I found her extremely professional, well informed and a joy to work with. I know she had a reputation for being a diva, but that was not my experience. She spent so much of her life on the road that I think her exacting demands (about, say, air conditioning) were born of her experiences of what could have and had gone wrong. At the Proms, I remember being struck by the audience she had brought in \u2013 it was the first time I\u2019d seen so many people of colour there. Thank goodness things are changing now, but she was about 20 years ahead of her time. She knew that boundaries, whether of colour or gender, had to be broken and she wasn\u2019t going to let anyone stop her.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ca813501b0af8cb5abcff49eea10892486f47e81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca813501b0af8cb5abcff49eea10892486f47e81/0_9_2322_1393/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Performing with Bruce Springsteen, Sting, Jon Bon Jovi, Elton John and Billy Joel.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Performing with Bruce Springsteen, Sting, Jon Bon Jovi, Elton John and Billy Joel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Time &amp; Life Pictures/The Life Picture Collection via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>\u2018Wide open spaces shrank in her hands\u2019</strong><br><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/iain-burnside\">Iain Burnside</a>, pianist</em><strong><br></strong>I never saw a singer dominate a space the way Jessye could.

I treasure her incredible spun line in Strauss\u2019s Wiegenlied and her power in Zueignung. Her high-cheekboned smile will never be surpassed. She conveyed joy like no one else. A couple of years ago, I met her at a dinner and drove her back to her hotel.

But she has always been such an inspiration, an idol, for me, from the extraordinary colours of her voice, her amazing technique, to her choices in terms of repertoire. She always gave 150% and I love and admire her for the way she spoke out for our art form. She was always clear about how important classical music is and that it needs to be part of all our lives. It didn\u2019t need justification. She showed that it doesn\u2019t matter if you are a man, a woman, black or white \u2013 when you have a voice as great as that, you need to share it.</p> <p><strong>\u2018Despite the odds, she commanded attention\u2019</strong><br><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/12/facing-the-music-willard-white\">Sir Willard White</a>, bass baritone<br></em>She approached everything she did, every role, with total commitment. She commanded attention, despite all the odds \u2013 in a way, she was actually inspired by the odds. She set such a high standard that she was intimidating and inspiring at the same time. Of her recordings, I would single out her <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00mw5v5\">Four Last Songs</a> for its elegance and beauty.

She was at a stage in her life when she didn\u2019t need to pay it forward, but she did, always. She was effusive in her compliments and really cared about me. She wanted to encourage me and my peers and see us succeed. She was undeniably a big personality, a magnetic and strong presence on stage. She was one of the last remaining divas, a very bold singer who brought commitment and charisma to everything she did. She was one of the greatest of her generation in German repertoire, but what I love about her was that as a musician she simply wanted to communicate. She dealt with racism, and she talked about people not wanting to give her her dues, but she was extremely resilient and focused. She let her voice speak for her. \u2018She wasn\u2019t going to let anyone stop her\u2019 Judith Weir, composer We worked together on a song cycle, woman.life.song, that was at the Proms in 2000. It\u2019s a project she dreamed up and was very intimately involved in the nitty gritty of shaping over the several years it took to develop. I remember she would send me very businesslike but charming faxes \u2013 now alas too faded to read. I wish I\u2019d photographed them. I found her extremely professional, well informed and a joy to work with. I know she had a reputation for being a diva, but that was not my experience. She spent so much of her life on the road that I think her exacting demands (about, say, air conditioning) were born of her experiences of what could have and had gone wrong. At the Proms, I remember being struck by the audience she had brought in \u2013 it was the first time I\u2019d seen so many people of colour there. Thank goodness things are changing now, but she was about 20 years ahead of her time. She knew that boundaries, whether of colour or gender, had to be broken and she wasn\u2019t going to let anyone stop her. \u2018Wide open spaces shrank in her hands\u2019 Iain Burnside, pianist I never saw a singer dominate a space the way Jessye could. The wide open spaces of the Royal Festival Hall shrank in her hands. Every gesture, vocal and physical, carried to the back wall. I treasure her incredible spun line in Strauss\u2019s Wiegenlied and her power in Zueignung. Her high-cheekboned smile will never be surpassed. She conveyed joy like no one else. A couple of years ago, I met her at a dinner and drove her back to her hotel. She squeezed my leg as she said thank you and I thought that my life was complete. \u2018Jessye always gave 150%\u2019 Lise Davidsen, soprano I\u2019ve only been able to get to know her voice through her recordings \u2013 I wish I\u2019d had the chance to see her live. But she has always been such an inspiration, an idol, for me, from the extraordinary colours of her voice, her amazing technique, to her choices in terms of repertoire. She always gave 150% and I love and admire her for the way she spoke out for our art form. She was always clear about how important classical music is and that it needs to be part of all our lives. It didn\u2019t need justification. She showed that it doesn\u2019t matter if you are a man, a woman, black or white \u2013 when you have a voice as great as that, you need to share it. \u2018Despite the odds, she commanded attention\u2019 Sir Willard White, bass baritone She approached everything she did, every role, with total commitment. She commanded attention, despite all the odds \u2013 in a way, she was actually inspired by the odds. She set such a high standard that she was intimidating and inspiring at the same time. Of her recordings, I would single out her Four Last Songs for its elegance and beauty. She showed how it should be done. \u2018Jessye will live on in our hearts\u2019 Joyce DiDonato, mezzo soprano The voice was instantly recognisable, the phrasing supreme, the persona larger than life, and the impact eternal. Jessye\u2019s onstage legacy will remain with us all, but her impact off stage changed lives and will continue to live on through her towering example, mentorship, leadership and passion. She will live on in our hearts for ever. \u2022 Interviews by Imogen Tilden",

      "bodyText": "Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has said his company will \u201cgo to the mat\u201d if Elizabeth Warren is elected president and seeks to fulfil her promise to break up America\u2019s tech giants. Having to mount a legal challenge, Zuckerberg said, would \u201csuck for us\u201d. In response, the Massachusetts senator said: \u201cWhat would really \u2018suck\u2019 is if we don\u2019t fix a corrupt system.\u201d In leaked transcripts of July internal meetings published by the Verge on Tuesday, Zuckerberg identifies \u201ca political movement where people are angry at the tech companies or are worried about concentration or worried about different issues and worried that they\u2019re not being handled well\u201d. He adds: \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that, even if there\u2019s anger \u2026 that you have someone like Elizabeth Warren who thinks that the right answer is to break up the companies.\u201d The Massachusetts senator made her promise in March, saying in a blogpost: \u201cToday\u2019s big tech companies have too much power \u2013 too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy. They\u2019ve bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else.\u201d Warren has performed strongly in recent polls, in some cases passing former vice-president Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic primary field. Last week, it was reported that key Democratic donors on Wall Street and in big business object to her plans on regulation and taxation and are threatening to sit out the election or back Donald Trump instead. If Warren is elected, Zuckerberg says, \u201cI would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge. And does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don\u2019t want to have a major lawsuit against our own government \u2026 it\u2019s like, we care about our country and want to work with our government and do good things. \u201cBut look, at the end of the day, if someone\u2019s going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.\u201d In tweets on Tuesday, Warren said she wanted to reform \u201ca corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid to hold big tech companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon accountable.\u201d In July, Facebook was fined $5bn by the Federal Trade Commission for privacy violations in connection with the Cambridge Analytica scandal. It was also fined $100m by the Securities and Exchange Commission for misleading investors on the risks involved in its use of personal data. Revenues soared regardless. In the transcripts, Zuckerberg also discusses the Libra cryptocurrency, his refusal to testify before foreign governments, competing with TikTok and other problems facing Facebook. On relations with the US government, he is asked if he is worried by the fine and \u201cthe rise of politicians like Senator Warren\u201d. Zuckerberg says \u201cbreaking up these companies, whether it\u2019s Facebook or Google or Amazon, is not actually going to solve the issues\u201d. Addressing election interference and voter manipulation, the heart of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, he adds: \u201cYou know, [breaking up big tech] doesn\u2019t make election interference less likely. It makes it more likely because now the companies can\u2019t coordinate and work together. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any of the hate speech or issues like that less likely. It makes it more likely because now ... all the processes that we\u2019re putting in place and investing in, now we\u2019re more fragmented.\u201d Zuckerberg draws laughter by saying Facebook\u2019s \u201cinvestment on safety\u201d is \u201cbigger than the whole revenue\u201d of Twitter. In conclusion, he concedes there is a need for \u201ca regulatory framework where people feel like there\u2019s real accountability. But he also says \u201cthe direction of the discussion\u201d is \u201cconcerning\u201d. \u201cI at least believe, I think, there are real issues,\u201d Zuckerberg says. \u201cI don\u2019t think that the antitrust remedies are going to solve them. \u201cBut I understand that if we don\u2019t help address those issues and help put in place a regulatory framework where people feel like there\u2019s real accountability, and the government can govern our sector, then yeah, people are just going to keep on getting angrier and angrier. \u201cAnd they\u2019re going to demand more extreme measures, and, eventually, people just say, \u2018Screw it, take a hammer to the whole thing.\u2019 And that\u2019s when the rule of law comes in, and I\u2019m very grateful that we have it.\u201d Zuckerberg acknowledged the leak in a post on Facebook on Tuesday.

      "bodyText": "A young soldier who collapsed and died during a army fitness exercise on a hot summer\u2019s day in the Brecon Beacons was one of 18 who dropped out, were withdrawn or fell ill, an inquest was told. Cpl Joshua Hoole, 26, died three years after three army reservists suffered fatal heat illness during an SAS selection march in the same area. Hoole, of 1 Rifles, was carrying 25kg (55lb) of equipment when he collapsed 400 metres from the end of the eight-mile annual fitness test course on 19 July 2016. The march in south Wales had been due to begin at 11am but started at 7am because particularly hot weather was forecast, the inquest in Birmingham heard on Tuesday. When the group arrived at the start of the exercise shortly before 6.30am, the temperature was 17C (63F). When the troops were half-way round, 10 had withdrawn, with one complaining of having a \u201cpulsating head \u2013 feeling too hot\u201d, and another having \u201cdifficulty breathing due to the heat\u201d. An hour into the march, L/Cpl George Knight was withdrawn, and later described \u201cblanking out and collapsing into a hedge\u201d. Another soldier also withdrew after feeling \u201cdizziness and confusion\u201d. SSgt Richard Jones, a Royal military police investigator, said Hoole collapsed at 8.52am, and despite the efforts of base medics, paramedics, and an air ambulance doctor, was pronounced dead at 9.39am. In total, 18 out of 41 soldiers dropped out, collapsed or were withdrawn by the course directing staff, including Hoole. Jones told the inquest that Cpt Colin Newfer, had been interviewed under caution over an allegation that he invited Knight and other soldiers to change statements about what had happened. A 2017 defence service inquiry report concluded that Hoole, of Ecclefechan in Dumfries and Galloway, died as a result of an undiagnosed underlying medical condition, not as a direct consequence of taking part in the annual fitness test. The conclusion is being challenged by Phillip Hoole, the father of Joshua and a former soldier, who successfully applied for an inquest to be resumed into the death and believes there were organisational failings in the way the exercise was handled. Phillip Hoole told the inquest: \u201cHe was a young man that was going places, with a great future ahead of him. He shone his light on all of us. Had his life not been extinguished, I am sure that he would have achieved much more.\u201d He added: \u201cAs a son, grandson, brother, friend, peer, leader and mentor or just an acquaintance, he had the ability to make you feel better about your own life. His life might have been extinguished but his love lives on, in all of us. Always swift and bold \u2013 and never forgotten.\u201d Hoole\u2019s inquest is being keenly watched by relatives of the three men who died in the SAS trial in the Brecon Beacons in July 2013. Louise Hunt, the coroner presiding in the Hoole inquest, concluded in 2015 that there were a \u201ccatalogue of very serious mistakes\u201d made by many people involved in the planning and execution of the SAS march and called for changes to be made in how exercises are organised on hot days. Bryher Dunsby, the widow of one of the men who died in 2013, Cpl James Dunsby, said: \u201cMy wish is that the MoD chooses to be truthful and transparent during the course of this inquest. I hope that Joshua\u2019s family and those closest to him get answers in a respectful and honourable way from the MoD.\u201d The inquest continues.",

      "bodyText": "Publisher Penguin Random House has dismissed claims that Lara Prescott, a debut novelist who received a $2m (\u00a31.6m) advance for her novel about the publication of Boris Pasternak\u2019s Doctor Zhivago, infringed the copyright of Pasternak\u2019s great-niece Anna Pasternak as \u201csimply without any merit\u201d. Published in September, Prescott\u2019s The Secrets We Kept tells of how the CIA planned to use Doctor Zhivago as a propaganda tool during the cold war. But Anna Pasternak revealed in the Sunday Times that she had sent a legal letter to Prescott, claiming that the novel features \u201can astonishing number of substantial elements\u201d copied from Pasternak\u2019s 2016 biography Lara, which is about Olga Ivinskaya, Pasternak\u2019s lover, muse and inspiration for his character Lara. The letter sees Anna Pasternak claim that similarities \u201cexceed the mere inspiration a novelist may legitimately draw from a work of non-fiction\u201d. She is seeking damages or compensation for the alleged infringement of copyright. An event with both authors at the forthcoming Cheltenham Literature festival \u2013 sponsored by the Sunday Times \u2013 has now been cancelled due to \u201cunforeseen circumstances\u201d. On Tuesday, Penguin Random House said that it and Prescott considered Anna Pasternak\u2019s claim to be unfounded. \u201cIf proceedings are in fact issued, they will be robustly defended,\u201d said the publisher. \u201cAnna Pasternak\u2019s claims are simply without any merit, and it is disappointing that she has chosen to litigate in the press rather than wait for the response to her letter of complaint within the timeline requested by her own lawyers.\u201d Penguin Random House pointed out that the story of Olga Ivinskaya has been the subject of multiple books before Anna Pasternak\u2019s, including Ivinskaya\u2019s 1978 autobiography, a book by her daughter Irina Emelyanova, and Peter Finn and Petra Couvee\u2019s 2014 book The Zhivago Affair. \u201cThe subject matter of both books is one of historical record and has been covered by other books in the past,\u201d said the publisher. When it was published in 2016, Lara was billed as: \u201cThe untold love story that inspired Doctor Zhivago\u201d.

One in Paris, where it is fashion week, and one in Cape Town, where the Duchess of Sussex is based during the royal tour, making for another kind of fashion week.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the thing: the key fashion news from each is the same. Your dress for next season? It\u2019s your dress for this season. Your new look is clothes you already wear, and a style you already have. In the past week, Meghan has worn two dresses that she wore on last autumn\u2019s visit to Tonga: a blue shirtdress by Veronica Beard, and a dark striped sundress by Martin Grant. Now, first things first: clearly it is ludicrous that a woman wearing a dress twice is in any way a news story. But it is. Meghan\u2019s \u201crecycling\u201d of her wardrobe has sparked a hundred headlines this week. Along with her denim jacket and her cross-body handbag, the dresses seem to be part of a soft relaunch of the Sussexes as low-key and relatable, post <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/shortcuts/2019/aug/20/why-carbon-offsetting-is-not-the-panacea-harry-and-meghan-might-think-it-is\" title=\"\">the whole private jet thing</a>.

Natacha Ramsay-Levi at Chlo\u00e9 and Sarah Burton at Alexander McQueen were both at pains to point out the looks on their catwalk this season that were tweaked versions of looks they had done before. Burton talked about \u201cnot throwing things away, of returning to pieces and working with them instead of always moving on so fast\u201d. Ramsay-Levi said she wanted to make it clear that Chlo\u00e9 clothes are not intended to be disposable. And all over the Paris catwalks, everywhere from Celine to Valentino, and from Christian Dior to Isabel Marant, the new collections spoke for themselves by being very much in the same vein as what we have been wearing for the past few seasons.</p> <p>I\u2019m talking about a loose-ish dress that falls to below your knees, or just above your ankles. A kind of 70s Paris vibe. Not exactly bookish, but definitely a bit cultured. Possibly a bit flirty but in that borderline-grumpy French way, not in the giggly eyelash-fluttery way. A bit like how I imagine it would have been to dress as a \u201cmodern woman\u201d in Saint Germain in the days when that just meant you bought your own red wine and cigarettes in Caf\u00e9 de Flore, before it all got really complicated. (Yes, I do realise it wasn\u2019t ever actually that simple, but just indulge me a moment in a little rose-tinted hindsight, thank you so much.) The look is glamorous, but via a trench coat and a bit of a heel and chunky gold jewellery, rather than scrappy sandals and diamonds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b7ea2698247ac499942a87bea7ff4f389d631966\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7ea2698247ac499942a87bea7ff4f389d631966/0_104_3132_4551/688.jpg\" alt=\"A metal chain belt at the Chloe show, SS20, Paris fashion week.\" width=\"688\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A metal chain belt at the Chloe show, SS2020, Paris fashion week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: WWD/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A long loose dress is the one piece that almost every woman I know has added to her wardrobe in the past two years. The white and black polka-dot tiered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/aug/11/the-story-of-the-dress-how-a-40-zara-frock-stole-the-summer\" title=\"\">Zara dress</a> that went viral this summer is the poster girl for the look. Yours might be that one, or it might be a different one, but I bet you have got (at least) one. Next season\u2019s dress looks a little different \u2013 or can be made to look a little different \u2013 because it has a bit more of a waist. Utilitarian shirt dresses are edging out the more out-of-office kaftan-styled vibe, so lots of next season\u2019s dresses have a row of buttons running flush to the body down the front, which lends them shape. And there are belts, too, suddenly. Not the kind that are a strip of fabric to match the dress, but proper belts, the sort you have probably got in a shoebox somewhere even if you haven\u2019t worn them for ages. At Alexander McQueen, loose white dresses were worn with wide, sturdy black belts. At Chlo\u00e9, Celine and Chanel, the belts were metal chain belts, softly weighting the fabric close to the body rather than cinching it in. At Dior\u2019s garden-themed show, floral dresses were softly waisted with braided and woven belts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cc8c127cbaab5cc6d358ee1254949427e0f5e5cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc8c127cbaab5cc6d358ee1254949427e0f5e5cf/0_0_3000_4500/667.jpg\" alt=\"Jumpsuits are still a thing: the Isabel Marant show, SS20, Paris fashion week.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jumpsuits are still a thing: the Isabel Marant show, SS20, Paris fashion week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laurent Laurent Vu/Sipa/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What else is changing?

Gold is the new beige \u2013 at both Celine and Saint Laurent, some of the absolutely standout dresses of very desirable collections were in soft gold \u2013 and gold as an accent colour, whether in a pair of boots or a chain belt, a chunky necklace or a Lurex thread running through a silk blouse, has been a recurring theme of the clothes I have seen this week on the catwalk, in the audience, and in the street-style crowds outside the shows.</p> <p>The coats that look right now are the coats that work over these dresses \u2013 loose and unstructured, like the black coat worn over a striped dress at Stella McCartney, or oversized blazers. For casual looks, jeans are on their way back, as are denim midiskirts. Jumpsuits are very much still a thing \u2013 see Meghan in a black one in Cape Town, and Gigi Hadid on the Isabel Marant catwalk. Culottes and longline shorts are definitely happening. (I am sceptical, to be honest. They looked very elegant at Valentino, but then Valentino can make anything look elegant.) White shirts and silk blouses are bankable for a good few more seasons. If you want to elevate things a notch or two, ditch the polite florals for bold neon, or a neckline plunging narrowly to your bottom rib, as at Valentino.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"55c182e324d46ad77bcd7d5a75fdb2a967620061\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/55c182e324d46ad77bcd7d5a75fdb2a967620061/0_228_3438_4832/712.jpg\" alt=\"A plunging neckline by Valentino, SS20, Paris fashion week.\" width=\"712\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A plunging neckline by Valentino, SS2020, Paris fashion week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The new-look dress is, literally, everywhere.

      "body": "<p>It is the census that utterly shames us as a nation. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the number of people dying homeless is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/oct/01/homeless-deaths-in-2018-rise-at-highest-level-ons\" title=\"\">at an all-time high</a>. An estimated <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsofhomelesspeopleinenglandandwales/2018\" title=\"\">726 homeless people died</a> in England and Wales in 2018, a 22% rise on 2017. The biggest rise was in drug-related deaths, up by 55% since 2017. This, in one of the world\u2019s richest nations, is a moral emergency \u2013 and it demands emergency action.</p> <p>Since I lost my dad to a tragic lifelong struggle with drink, I\u2019ve worked with Birmingham\u2019s homeless community. What drives me is the simple realisation that so many people sleeping rough are self-medicating for trauma and distress with drugs and alcohol in exactly the same way my dad did.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/sep/24/jake-humms-death-fills-me-with-anger-and-despair-thousands-like-him-are-at-risk\">Jake Humm's death fills me with anger and despair \u2013 thousands like him are at risk</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That trauma and distress could hit any one of us. Everyone I\u2019ve ever met sleeping homeless has been hit, hurt and knocked down by some sort of twist of fate. But the destruction of Britain\u2019s safety net \u2013 what we once called social insurance \u2013 means there is now nothing to catch us. The rollback of every public service now means our social security is in systems failure.</p> <p>In the cold night in our shopping arcades, you can find newcomers \u201cwithout recourse to public funds\u201d forced to sleep rough. I\u2019ve seen young men newly out of prison, released without any care for where they went. Last week, I met Anthony, who had been sleeping rough since he was heavily sanctioned by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), and who had lost the fingers on one hand. I\u2019ll never forget finding a disabled man when I was out with a team of volunteers \u2013 ashen grey, crying in pain, next to his wheelchair in an underpass that stank of urine. He\u2019d been there for three days, still dressed in his hospital gown, with a tag on his wrist. It took us two hours to get him an ambulance. </p> <p>This is the new normal. Especially at risk are those who grew up in our care system \u2013 like young Kane Walker, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/sep/30/the-homeless-death-of-kane-walker-how-we-let-down-the-kid-from-care\" title=\"\">whom the Guardian featured this week</a>. His death in January shocked our city. At his memorial service, homeless citizens lit candles in his memory.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/sep/17/homeless-deaths-share-your-tributes\">Homeless deaths: share your tributes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We cannot go on like this. But we cannot make homelessness history unless we confront the harsh realities of what\u2019s happening. This is why I\u2019m pressing for changes to the law. We urgently need what I\u2019ve called Kane\u2019s Law, to create a duty on public agencies, especially the DWP, the NHS, mental health services and the prison service to work with councils to prevent homelessness. We need reviews for everyone who dies homeless, so that the inconvenient truths of life and death cannot be ignored.</p> <p>One of our region\u2019s homelessness campaigners once said to me: \u201cRemember, we\u2019re not trying to get rid of \u2018houselessness\u2019.

      "bodyText": "It is the census that utterly shames us as a nation. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the number of people dying homeless is at an all-time high. An estimated 726 homeless people died in England and Wales in 2018, a 22% rise on 2017. The biggest rise was in drug-related deaths, up by 55% since 2017. This, in one of the world\u2019s richest nations, is a moral emergency \u2013 and it demands emergency action. Since I lost my dad to a tragic lifelong struggle with drink, I\u2019ve worked with Birmingham\u2019s homeless community. What drives me is the simple realisation that so many people sleeping rough are self-medicating for trauma and distress with drugs and alcohol in exactly the same way my dad did. That trauma and distress could hit any one of us. Everyone I\u2019ve ever met sleeping homeless has been hit, hurt and knocked down by some sort of twist of fate. But the destruction of Britain\u2019s safety net \u2013 what we once called social insurance \u2013 means there is now nothing to catch us. The rollback of every public service now means our social security is in systems failure. In the cold night in our shopping arcades, you can find newcomers \u201cwithout recourse to public funds\u201d forced to sleep rough. I\u2019ve seen young men newly out of prison, released without any care for where they went. Last week, I met Anthony, who had been sleeping rough since he was heavily sanctioned by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), and who had lost the fingers on one hand. I\u2019ll never forget finding a disabled man when I was out with a team of volunteers \u2013 ashen grey, crying in pain, next to his wheelchair in an underpass that stank of urine. He\u2019d been there for three days, still dressed in his hospital gown, with a tag on his wrist. It took us two hours to get him an ambulance. This is the new normal. Especially at risk are those who grew up in our care system \u2013 like young Kane Walker, whom the Guardian featured this week. His death in January shocked our city. At his memorial service, homeless citizens lit candles in his memory. We cannot go on like this. But we cannot make homelessness history unless we confront the harsh realities of what\u2019s happening. This is why I\u2019m pressing for changes to the law. We urgently need what I\u2019ve called Kane\u2019s Law, to create a duty on public agencies, especially the DWP, the NHS, mental health services and the prison service to work with councils to prevent homelessness. We need reviews for everyone who dies homeless, so that the inconvenient truths of life and death cannot be ignored. One of our region\u2019s homelessness campaigners once said to me: \u201cRemember, we\u2019re not trying to get rid of \u2018houselessness\u2019. We\u2019re trying to get rid of homelessness. A home is where you feel safe, warm, loved.\u201d Compassion is still the greatest quality of this nation. We used it once to build a country where we all looked after each other. That is the mission around which good people must now unite, before hundreds more die on our streets. \u2022 Liam Byrne is Labour MP for Birmingham Hodge Hill and former chief secretary to the Treasury",

      "bodyText": "The relatives of five men summarily executed during the final years of Dutch colonial rule in Indonesia will have their case heard in court after a ground-breaking decision to lift the statute of limitations.

The relatives \u2013 five men and one woman \u2013 will have the opportunity to prove they are the children of those executed in 1947. If that is the case, they can claim a reimbursement of the costs of their living.

But the appeal for limitation was rejected. \u201cThe court of appeal is of the opinion that especially the extraordinary seriousness and the high degree of culpability of the violence used stand in the way of limitation,\u201d the judge said. \u201cAt the time, the Netherlands failed to register who was shot or abused and when.\u201d The executions carried out by Dutch soldiers took place in 1947 during so-called \u201ccleansing actions\u201d on South Celebes, now called Sulawesi, an island east of Borneo. Japan had occupied the then Dutch colony of the Dutch East Indies during the second world war, but after its capitulation the nationalist leaders Sukarno and Hatta proclaimed the Republic of Indonesia on 17 August 1945. For the following four years, the Netherlands fought to prolong its 350 years of colonial rule of the country, often through barbaric means. Klaas Meijer, a spokesman for the ministry of defence, said the government would study the rulings before deciding its next steps. It could appeal again to higher courts.",

He was elected on an ambitious goal \u2013 to heal <em>la fracture sociale</em><em> \u2013</em> but he gave up every time he encountered a protest. It is hard to think of a single lasting reform he ever followed through on.

But the French love affair with Chirac took off precisely because he didn\u2019t do any Blairite-type reforming. He was sticking to big principles on more comfortable ground. The French love that. By <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/feb/25/iraq.france\" title=\"\">opposing the US-UK war in Iraq</a>, his popularity reached its height at the very moment when Blair began to fall from grace in the UK. </p> <p>Seeing four living presidents parade into the <em>eglise</em> Saint-Sulpice for Chirac\u2019s funeral was a reminder of how these individuals have come to embody the political eras they oversaw.</p> <p>Between them \u2013 Val\u00e9ry Giscard d\u2019Estaing, Nicolas Sarkozy, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/22/francois-hollande-france-election\" title=\"\">Fran\u00e7ois Hollande</a> and Emmanuel Macron \u2013 they have presided over the last 50 years of our political history.

Hollande was his Socialist party opponent but got on so well with the Conservative Chirac that the latter declared his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/13/chirac-liberator-get-rid-of-sarkozy\" title=\"\">vote would go to Hollande</a> rather than Sarkozy in 2012.</p> <p>Macron paid a long tribute to his predecessor, but two years into his term, he is struggling for the nation\u2019s affections himself.

And in these populist times, with his main opposition coming from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/27/eu-vote-confirms-french-far-right-marine-le-pen-national-rally-as-emmanuel-macron-main-opposition\" title=\"\">the far right</a>, being so identifiably \u201cof the elite\u201d, so young and lacking provincial roots in a country in desperate search of a father figure, is not easy.

His puppet on Les Guignols, a satirical TV show, always had the knives of allies who\u2019d betrayed him sticking out of his back, which the nation always found endearing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/11/emmanuel-macron-machiavelli-prince\">Macron studied Machiavelli.

And just like \u201cJohnny\u201d, he reminded the French of a more innocent era that began with the loosening up of the swinging 1960s: a time of more straightforward politics, without the calculations required for the era of social media and Trump-Johnsonian bombast, or the normalisation of turning \u201cthe people\u201d against the political class.</p> <p>It will be impossible for Macron to ever emulate Chirac\u2019s legacy.

This is where we are now. It seems remarkable that Chirac can be mourned with such affection when he delivered so little and left office under a cloud of corruption. He was elected on an ambitious goal \u2013 to heal la fracture sociale \u2013 but he gave up every time he encountered a protest. It is hard to think of a single lasting reform he ever followed through on. He would have almost certainly given into the gilets jaunes much more quickly than Macron did. Chirac\u2019s presidency ran from 1995 to 2007, overlapping with Tony Blair\u2019s decade as British prime minister, and they faced similar global challenges. But the French love affair with Chirac took off precisely because he didn\u2019t do any Blairite-type reforming. He was sticking to big principles on more comfortable ground. The French love that. By opposing the US-UK war in Iraq, his popularity reached its height at the very moment when Blair began to fall from grace in the UK. Seeing four living presidents parade into the eglise Saint-Sulpice for Chirac\u2019s funeral was a reminder of how these individuals have come to embody the political eras they oversaw. Between them \u2013 Val\u00e9ry Giscard d\u2019Estaing, Nicolas Sarkozy, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Emmanuel Macron \u2013 they have presided over the last 50 years of our political history. We have loved and hated them as almighty president-gods; in our minds they are Shakespearean characters who have acted out decades of political intrigue, power struggle and treason. Giscard, still going at 93, despised Chirac. The feeling was mutual: Chirac hated Giscard so much that he betrayed him by voting for the socialist Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand over him in 1981. Sarkozy was a Chirac protege who betrayed his mentor in favour of the enemy \u00c9douard Balladur. Hollande was his Socialist party opponent but got on so well with the Conservative Chirac that the latter declared his vote would go to Hollande rather than Sarkozy in 2012. Macron paid a long tribute to his predecessor, but two years into his term, he is struggling for the nation\u2019s affections himself. He may have recovered from the low point of the gilets jaunes protests when he seemed completely out of touch, but he faces more turmoil in the autumn as he tries to push through ambitious social reforms and get his vision for transforming the EU back on track. And in these populist times, with his main opposition coming from the far right, being so identifiably \u201cof the elite\u201d, so young and lacking provincial roots in a country in desperate search of a father figure, is not easy. Macron, Hollande, Sarkozy and Giscard must have all wondered, as they surveyed the congregation, if they would one day be mourned like Chirac. Who knows, but I think what France was mourning this week was not Chirac the man, but rather presidential politics from a simpler era. Chirac was a political chameleon: urbane yet utterly in touch with the grassroots, a culture lover, a womaniser, a bon vivant yet down to earth, dishonest but somehow able to appear uncynical. His puppet on Les Guignols, a satirical TV show, always had the knives of allies who\u2019d betrayed him sticking out of his back, which the nation always found endearing. He could be all things to all voters: a man of the right and a man of the left. He had an instinctive understanding of what motivated ordinary farming people all over his rural Correze constituency. Chirac was the Johnny Hallyday of French politics. Like the singer idolised by the French for generations, he had the style of a cowboy \u201c\u00e0 l\u2019ancienne\u201d. And just like \u201cJohnny\u201d, he reminded the French of a more innocent era that began with the loosening up of the swinging 1960s: a time of more straightforward politics, without the calculations required for the era of social media and Trump-Johnsonian bombast, or the normalisation of turning \u201cthe people\u201d against the political class. It will be impossible for Macron to ever emulate Chirac\u2019s legacy. Chirac governed at a time when a French president, even one who so manifestly failed to give the French the better lives they demanded, could make himself popular without being a populist. \u2022 Marion Van Renterghem is a French journalist",

In 2008 she revealed the imaginative hinterland to this work in The Russian Jerusalem, a novel that mixes poetry and prose to trace Soviet persecution of the poets she called the \u201cJews\u201d of Russian culture.</p> <p>The poetry for which she created an English-speaking audience deeply influenced her own. Driven by cultural curiosity, she also helped bring very different, North American traditions of black mountain and beat poetry to Britain.</p> <p>In 1959 she founded Prospect magazine (unrelated to the current journal of that name), publishing Allen Ginsberg, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/jan/20/guardianobituaries.books1\" title=\"\">Gregory Corso</a> and, among others, Charles Olson, whose Letter to Elaine Feinstein remains today a much anthologised projectivist text.

More than a dozen poetry collections followed her debut, In a Green Eye (1966), including Talking to the Dead (2007) \u2013 elegies of meditative intimacy for her husband, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/dec/10/guardianobituaries.obituaries\" title=\"\">the molecular biologist Arnold Feinstein</a>, who died in 2002 \u2013 and the themed studies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/sep/25/cities-elaine-feinstein-ruth-padel\" title=\"\">Cities</a> (2010) and Portraits (2015).

Elaine\u2019s psychologically exploratory fiction often centred on women\u2019s lives. Her first novel, The Circle, appeared in 1970, the year that also saw the publication of Germaine Greer\u2019s The Female Eunuch and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/07/kate-millett-obituary\" title=\"\">Kate Millett</a>\u2019s Sexual Politics \u2013 these were the books that fuelled a zeitgeist.</p> <p>Short stories, radio and TV drama, followed, as well as 13 further novels including The Glass Alembic (1973), which established her reputation on both sides of the Atlantic, and Mother\u2019s Girl (1988). Further biographies, criticism and edited volumes also followed, as did an autobiography. It Goes With the Territory (2013) is subtitled Memoirs of a Poet, and Elaine\u2019s career was exemplary, not only in the lasting significance of her work but in the range and depth of her literary friendships.</p> <p>Yet she was unafraid to acknowledge the \u201cthree strikes\u201d that her times could hold against her, as <a href=\"https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/feinstein-elaine\" title=\"\">a Jewish woman from the north of England</a>. Born in Bootle, Merseyside, she was the only child of Isadore Cooklin and Fay (nee Compton), and grew up in Leicester, where her father was a cabinet maker. But she never forgot that all four of her grandparents had been born in Odessa, now in Ukraine.</p> <p>From Wyggeston grammar school for girls, in 1949 she went to Newnham College, Cambridge, as an exhibitioner to study English. Wartime adolescence \u2013 which had to assimilate the revelations of the Nazi death camps \u2013 was now replaced by the excitement of being among only the second intake of women allowed to join the university. She studied for the bar after graduating, but decided not to practise. In 1956 she married <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/dec/10/guardianobituaries.obituaries\" title=\"\">Arnold</a> and moved back to Cambridge, where their three sons were born and their home became a meeting place for visiting writers from around the world, among them Yevgeny Yevtushenko, Miroslav Holub and Yehuda Amichai.</p> <p>Elaine worked at Cambridge University Press (1959-62), at Hockerill teacher training college (1963-66) and then in <a href=\"http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/m/memory-maps-six-poems-donald-davie/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMInd3MhaL75AIVTLDtCh3xjgchEAAYASAAEgJu7PD_BwE\" title=\"\">Donald </a><a href=\"http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/m/memory-maps-six-poems-donald-davie/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMInd3MhaL75AIVTLDtCh3xjgchEAAYASAAEgJu7PD_BwE\" title=\"\">Davie</a>\u2019s new comparative literature department at the University of Essex till 1970, when she left to become a full-time writer.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e2A1IjUlzU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-e2A1IjUlzU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Elaine Feinstein reading her poem A Visit</figcaption> </figure>   <p>She revised her Tsvetaeva translations (1971), produced her translations of Three Russian Poets (1976), and received three Arts Council awards for translation. She began to write for the Guardian, the Times and the New York Review of Books.</p> <p>In 1973 both Elaine\u2019s parents died, and her work turned towards conscious exploration of Jewish identity and central European tradition. The novels The Survivors (1982) and The Border (1984) tell stories of Holocaust survival. Related themes thread the poetry collections of the 80s and 90s, though often tangentially. The writing life also remained an enduring theme: biographies of Hughes and DH Lawrence were followed by Gold (2000), a verse portrait of Mozart\u2019s Jewish librettist, Lorenzo da Ponte.</p> <p>Elaine became a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature (1981) and received a Civil List pension (2005).

In 2008 she revealed the imaginative hinterland to this work in The Russian Jerusalem, a novel that mixes poetry and prose to trace Soviet persecution of the poets she called the \u201cJews\u201d of Russian culture. The poetry for which she created an English-speaking audience deeply influenced her own. Driven by cultural curiosity, she also helped bring very different, North American traditions of black mountain and beat poetry to Britain. In 1959 she founded Prospect magazine (unrelated to the current journal of that name), publishing Allen Ginsberg, Gregory Corso and, among others, Charles Olson, whose Letter to Elaine Feinstein remains today a much anthologised projectivist text. Though projectivism, taking a breath as the poetic unit, may now be consigned to literary history, Prospect\u2019s transatlantic cultural exchange helped create today\u2019s Anglo-American Cambridge school of poetry, with JH Prynne at its centre. But it is the clear-sighted and profoundly emotionally intelligent character of Elaine\u2019s own verse that has influenced many poets working in English today, as well as delighting readers and audiences around the world: she was a charismatic performer. Ted Hughes wrote that her poetry \u201cfollows the track of the nerves\u201d, while George Steiner described it as \u201cinstinct with caring, with a rare intelligence of pain\u201d. More than a dozen poetry collections followed her debut, In a Green Eye (1966), including Talking to the Dead (2007) \u2013 elegies of meditative intimacy for her husband, the molecular biologist Arnold Feinstein, who died in 2002 \u2013 and the themed studies Cities (2010) and Portraits (2015). They culminate in her last published volume, the new and selected poems of The Clinic, Memory (2017). As a poet, Elaine\u2019s voice is unique. In prose, she was one of a generation of women, among them Angela Carter, Eva Figes and Elaine\u2019s close friend Emma Tennant, who transformed British reading and publishing in the 70s. Elaine\u2019s psychologically exploratory fiction often centred on women\u2019s lives. Her first novel, The Circle, appeared in 1970, the year that also saw the publication of Germaine Greer\u2019s The Female Eunuch and Kate Millett\u2019s Sexual Politics \u2013 these were the books that fuelled a zeitgeist. Short stories, radio and TV drama, followed, as well as 13 further novels including The Glass Alembic (1973), which established her reputation on both sides of the Atlantic, and Mother\u2019s Girl (1988). Further biographies, criticism and edited volumes also followed, as did an autobiography. It Goes With the Territory (2013) is subtitled Memoirs of a Poet, and Elaine\u2019s career was exemplary, not only in the lasting significance of her work but in the range and depth of her literary friendships. Yet she was unafraid to acknowledge the \u201cthree strikes\u201d that her times could hold against her, as a Jewish woman from the north of England. Born in Bootle, Merseyside, she was the only child of Isadore Cooklin and Fay (nee Compton), and grew up in Leicester, where her father was a cabinet maker. But she never forgot that all four of her grandparents had been born in Odessa, now in Ukraine. From Wyggeston grammar school for girls, in 1949 she went to Newnham College, Cambridge, as an exhibitioner to study English. Wartime adolescence \u2013 which had to assimilate the revelations of the Nazi death camps \u2013 was now replaced by the excitement of being among only the second intake of women allowed to join the university. She studied for the bar after graduating, but decided not to practise. In 1956 she married Arnold and moved back to Cambridge, where their three sons were born and their home became a meeting place for visiting writers from around the world, among them Yevgeny Yevtushenko, Miroslav Holub and Yehuda Amichai. Elaine worked at Cambridge University Press (1959-62), at Hockerill teacher training college (1963-66) and then in Donald Davie\u2019s new comparative literature department at the University of Essex till 1970, when she left to become a full-time writer. She revised her Tsvetaeva translations (1971), produced her translations of Three Russian Poets (1976), and received three Arts Council awards for translation. She began to write for the Guardian, the Times and the New York Review of Books. In 1973 both Elaine\u2019s parents died, and her work turned towards conscious exploration of Jewish identity and central European tradition. The novels The Survivors (1982) and The Border (1984) tell stories of Holocaust survival. Related themes thread the poetry collections of the 80s and 90s, though often tangentially. The writing life also remained an enduring theme: biographies of Hughes and DH Lawrence were followed by Gold (2000), a verse portrait of Mozart\u2019s Jewish librettist, Lorenzo da Ponte. Elaine became a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature (1981) and received a Civil List pension (2005). She was widely translated and travelled with zest, with literary fellowships for the British Council in Norway and Singapore, and, always collegiate, serving on prize juries. The compassionate, wry, and often very funny understanding of human nature that characterises her writing also gave Elaine a great gift for loving friendship and family life. She is survived by her sons Adam, Martin and Joel, and grandchildren Lara, Katriona, Johnny, Natasha, Zack and Alicia. \u2022 Elaine Barbara Feinstein, poet and writer, born 24 October 1930; died 23 September 2019 \u2022 This piece was amended on 3 October 2019 to correct the name of the Russian poet Marina Tsvetaeva",

      "bodyText": "We will now bring our coverage of today\u2019s events in Hong Kong to a close, as protests and riots go on into the night. Hong Kong police shot an 18-year-old protester with live ammunition, marking a major escalation in the use of force against demonstrators. Protests called to mark a \u201cnational day of grief\u201d saw tens of thousands of people demonstrate across the city in defiance of a ban on the protests in what was the most widespread show of public anger towards Beijing yet. 51 people \u2013 aged 11 to 75 \u2013 were confirmed to have been injured during the protests, as of 8pm local time. Two were in a critical condition while another two are in a serious condition, according to the Hospital Authority Authorities confirmed that one of the critically injured was in Queen Elizabeth hospital, after reports said the 18-year-old who was shot had been transferred there. Protesters staged pitched battles with police as the demonstrations descended into riots in places, with government buildings stormed and businesses perceived to be pro-Beijing targeted. Protesters were ordered to leave the legislative council complex, though it remained unclear what happened inside the building. The UK foreign secretary Dominic Raab said the use of live ammunition was disproportionate, and joined the EU in calling for de-escalation. Hong Kong police have previously caused severe injuries with rubber bullets and beanbag rounds, including to the eyes of a protestor and a journalist. However until today, they had only fired live rounds in warning. The protests came as China celebrated 70 years of Communist party rule with a triumphalist military parade. Here is our latest report from Hong Kong. Thanks for joining us. The Legislative Council secretariat has now lifted the red alert that it issued earlier (see 10.41am). It is unclear exactly what happened but it is clear that protesters entered the building. In July, hundreds of protesters broke into Hong Kong\u2019s legislature and sprayed graffiti on the walls. The UK foreign secretary Dominic Raab has said that the use of live ammunition by Hong Kong police was disproportionate after a teenage demonstrator was shot. He said in a statement: Whilst there is no excuse for violence, the use of live ammunition is disproportionate, and only risks inflaming the situation. This incident underlines the need for a constructive dialogue to address the legitimate concerns of the people of Hong Kong. We need to see restraint and a de-escalation from both protesters and the Hong Kong authorities. Just over a kilometre away from Sham Shui Po, several more rounds of tear gas have been shot in Mongkok, near the Prince Edward station. The area in the vicinity of the station has been the flash point of protests over the past month due to a rumour that people died during a police attack on protesters on August 31. People shouted the popular slogan \u201cReclaim Hong Kong! Revolution of our era!\u201d as tear gas was fired, before they opened umbrellas behind a make shift barricade and retreated. Someone threw a petrol bomb as protesters formed a defence line. \u201cHong Kongers, go!\u201d they shouted, before another round of tear gas was fired. The Hong Kong police force have issued a new statement condemning the ongoing rioting across the semi-autonomous state. Rioters continue to damage public properties and buildings extensively across Kowloon, Hong Kong Island and the New Territories. This poses a serious threat to public peace and order. Rioters have damaged the government offices in multiple districts, smashing up glass panes and facilities. Another group of rioters have stormed various MTR stations and damaged facilities therein. Rioters even hurled numerous petrol bombs into train compartments in Tsuen Wan MTR station, and onto platforms in Tai Wai MTR station. Such acts seriously disrupt railway system. Some rioters attempted to burn light poles and ATMs, seriously endangering public order. Appallingly, some rioters beat up bystanders in different districts, taking the law into their own hands. The police warn all rioters to stop all illegal acts and express the strongest condemnation against all violent acts of rioters. The police are conducting dispersal and arrest operations in various districts in Hong Kong. Due to the dangerous situation, the Police appeal to all members of the public to stay in safe places and stay tuned to the latest situation. UK-based charity Hong Kong Watch have condemned the shooting earlier as an \u201cappalling escalation of police brutality\u201d and highlighted how journalists have been intimidated. It also called on the UK government to consider measures to defend the rights of people in Hong Kong. It said in a statement: On 1 October 2019, a police officer fired a live round at a protestor at close range, leaving the young man in a critical condition. This is an appalling escalation of police brutality which demands a robust response from the British government and the wider international community. There were widespread protests across Hong Kong on Tuesday, as the as the Chinese Communist Party marked the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the People\u2019s Republic of China, with confrontations taking place across the city between protestors and the Hong Kong police. During one of these confrontations, a police officer shot the young Form Five student from point blank range with a live bullet. Although Hong Kong Watch does not support or condone the violence of a minority of protestors in these confrontations, the police response was grossly disproportionate. This incident is part of a wider cycle of police brutality. A recent Amnesty International report confirms \u201can alarming pattern of the Hong Kong Police Force deploying reckless and indiscriminate tactics\u201d in their arrests, as well as beating and torturing people in detention. The intimidation of the press in recent weeks is also unacceptable. A journalist for an Indonesian-language publication was recently shot with a rubber bullet, despite the journalist not being in the vicinity of protestors and being clearly identifiable as a member of the press. The Foreign Correspondent\u2019s Club report that over the weekend journalists were hit by tear gas canisters and rubber bullets, targeted with pepper spray, verbally threatened by the police, and blocked from documenting the arrests of protestors. Hong Kong Watch calls on the United Kingdom government to consider measures which can be taken to defend the rights and freedoms of people in Hong Kong. The integrity of the Sino-British Joint Declaration is gravely threatened, and the government should consider every available means to stand with people in Hong Kong. This should include extending the rights of BNO passport holders; extending Magnitsky sanctions to officials who have committed abuses of human rights; and establishing a \u2018contact group\u2019 at the United Nations of like-minded countries to act collectively to defend the rights and freedoms of Hong Kongers. The protests have endured in Sham Shui Po, where a banner reading \u201cWhen dictatorship is a fact, revolution becomes a duty\u201d lays across the street. Nearby, fireworks are let off into the air by protesters saying this is \u201cthe true National Day for Hongkongers.\u201d The government information service has told the Guardian that 51 people \u2013 aged 11 to 75 \u2013 have been injured today during the protests, as of 8pm local time. Two are in a critical condition while another two are in a serious condition, according to the Hospital Authority. It confirmed that one of the critically injured was in Queen Elizabeth hospital, after reports said the 18-year-old who was shot had been transferred there. The latest photos we have as the demonstrations and disorder go on into the night. As celebrations marking the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Communist party go on into the night, pro-Beijing politician Junius Ho Kwan-yiu \u2013 who is currently in the Chinese capital \u2013 has called for emergency laws to restore order in Hong Kong. In a statement carried by SCMP, he said: It is the National Day of the People\u2019s Republic of China today. All Chinese and decent people are supposed to be celebrating this great day and the great achievements of our motherland joyously together. I am terribly saddened by all the riotous events that have happened at various places in Hong Kong today. Police were attacked and forced to defend themselves with side arms. My office was damaged by mobsters for the third time. It is already clear that such a trend of violence is escalating and damages to the district offices of several of my colleagues have also been inflicted. It seems there is no sign of this coming to an end until the government is determined to clamp down and call for emergency measures under Cap 241 - the Emergency Regulations Ordinance. I hereby urge our [chief executive] to take prompt action to introduce all necessary means to restore law and order, and hence peace in Hong Kong. BuzzFeed journalist Rosalind Adams has tweeted about the intimidation she was subject to while she was reporting earlier. The number of people admitted to hospital is rising and there are now 31 confirmed injured, including two men in critical conditions and one in a serious condition, the SCMP quoted the Hospital Authority as saying. There are reports of a hit and run in Sham Shui Po, amid ongoing attempts to disperse protesters from outside a police station. Photos circulating show paramedics attending to somebody who was apparently hit by a taxi. As protests go on into the night, police senior superintendent Yolanda Yu Hoi-kwan has said the officer that shot an 18-year-old man with a live round did so because he \u201cfelt his life was under serious threat\u201d. She said in a video posted on Facebook: At about 4pm, a large group of rioters attacked police officers near Tai Ho Road, and they continued with their attack after officers warned them to stop. As an officer felt his life was under serious threat, he fired a round at the assailant to save his own life and his colleagues\u2019 lives. The round hit an 18-year-old, and the area near his left shoulder was injured, and he was conscious when taken to Princess Margaret Hospital. The police force really did not want to see anyone being injured, so we feel very sad about this. We warn rioters to stop breaking the law immediately, as we will strictly enforce the law. However, Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor director Law Yuk-kai has said the officer acted inappropriately. \u201cThe officer should de-escalate the tension instead of raising the danger level,\u201d he told the SCMP. \u201cNow he is blaming his wrong judgment on others to legitimise [the shooting].\u201d As it approaches 8pm local time, fires have been lit in the streets in Tuen Mun, an out-of-town western district where protesters have been heard shouting: \u201cReclaim Hong Kong! Revolution of our era\u201d. Elsewhere, in Fortress Hill, buses are being searched The fire service have put out a fire at Tai Wai metro station, before protesters trashed the building. In their first statement in four hours, the Hong Kong police force have advised the public to not go outside due to rioting. A British politician, the Liberal Democrat chief whip Alistair Carmichael, has urged the UK government to not \u201cstand silently by\u201d after the shooting of a protester by police today. It is absolutely heart-breaking and unacceptable that a protestor has been shot while calling for their democratic rights and freedoms. The situation is abhorrent. The UK government must not stand silently by and let this happen. We have a moral and legal duty to the people of Hong Kong. The Chinese government have clearly reneged on the Joint Sino-British Declaration: there is absolutely no denying that. Liberal Democrats will continue to demand that the Conservative government hold the Chinese government to account on the promises made during the handover, bring an end to these repressive scenes, and secure an independent investigation into the violence in Hong Kong. Meanwhile, the European Union has called for de-escalation and restraint. \u201cIn light of the continuing unrest and violence in Hong Kong, the European Union continues to stress that dialogue, de-escalation and restraint are the only way forward,\u201d EU spokeswoman Maja Kocijancic told reporters. More than one-third of the MTR\u2019s 91 stations have now reportedly been closed, after Long Ping station was confirmed to have shut, as the intensifying protests bring Hong Kong ever closer to a standstill. In a statement, the Transport department said that the MTR train service has been adjusted \u201cdue to public activities\u201d. It confirmed Long Ping station was closed and trains would not stop at that station \u201cTrain service on Ma On Shan Line and Tsuen Wan Line is suspended,\u201d the statement read. \u201cPrince Edward to Yau Ma Tei, HKU, Sai Ying Pun, Central to Causeway Bay, Diamond Hill to Lok Fu, Tai Wai, Sha Tin, East Tsim Sha Tsui, Tsuen Wan West, Yuen Long, Siu Hong and Tuen Mun stations are closed and trains will not stop at these stations.\u201d Public broadcaster Radio Television Hong Kong has withdrawn all of its reporters from the ground after one of its journalists was hit in the head by a projectile. RTHK reported: The male reporter suffered a wound above his right eye and was treated by first aiders before being helped to an ambulance to be taken to hospital. He had been covering the protest in the Sham Shui Po area throughout the afternoon, which included a government building getting vandalised and attempts to throw Molotov cocktails at the area\u2019s police station. The journalist said he wasn\u2019t sure what struck him. Earlier in the day, a female reporter from the station said a riot police officer had pointed a shotgun right at her at the intersection of Queensway and Queens Road East. With journalists from other media outlets also getting splashed by a corrosive liquid while covering the clashes, RTHK\u2019s English News And Current Affairs unit decided it was no longer safe for its reporters to be on the streets during the National Day protests. Further reporting on the day\u2019s events was being carried out from the station\u2019s newsrooms. Fires are being lit in the streets at Causeway Bay on Hong Kong Island as a water cannon truck approaches. amid a standoff between protesters and police.

One officer runs into frame with his sidearm drawn.He kicks a protester before firing at near point black range into the chest of a protester with a metal pole in his hand. An gunshot can be heard as the pistol rears upwards. The protester stumbles backwards and then falls over a police officer who has been knocked to the ground as the rest of the demonstrators run away. A second video, filmed by Hong Kong University\u2019s Campus TV, showed the same incident from a different angle. Footage filmed shortly afterwards by local broadcaster Stand News showed police officers treating the prone man who had an oxygen mask on his face and his t-shirt cut open, traces of blood on his chest. Paramedics later arrived on scene and placed the man, who was conscious, on to a stretcher. Police are now charging at protesters in Wong Tai Sin district after businesses were vandalised. The SCMP reports that the protester shot earlier was a form five student, suggesting he is no older than 18. He is being transferred to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Yau Ma Tei, which has the nearest cardiothoracic surgery centre, a source told the paper. Hong Kong police have said a pro-democracy protester was shot in the chest by officer during clashes today, the Associated Press report.

There are tense scenes in Hennessy Road as police deploy water cannons and make arrests. This is the latest from Reuters: Hong Kong police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at pro-democracy protesters throwing petrol bombs in the Asian financial hub on Tuesday as its Chinese rulers celebrated the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic.

Violence also spread across the harbour to Kowloon and beyond to the New Territories in the most widespread unrest in nearly four months. The South China Morning Post and television reports said at least one person was wounded in the chest by police firing live rounds. Police did not respond to requests for comment but have said they fired live rounds into the air in previous clashes. Fifteen people were wounded, one critically, the Hospital Authority said without giving details. Police fired water cannon and volley after volley of tear gas to disperse protesters throwing Molotov cocktails outside central government offices in the Admiralty area and ordered the evacuation of the Legislative Council building next door.

No details were immediately available. SCMP\u2019s Rachel Cheung reports that a protester has been hit by a car in an apparent hit and run. Police have used tear gas to disperse protesters who were digging up the Tuen Mun light rail tram tracks, in an out-of-town district in the New Territories. They are now retreating after police charged at them from two directions amid the sound of gun shots, as protesters threw objects back at police. Elsewhere, in Shatin, police have fired tear gas and charged at protesters who set fires alight fires on a main street. The Hospital Authority has told South China Morning Post that 15 people have been injured today, including one who is in a critical condition at Princess Margaret Hospital. The newspaper now appears to have confirmed a man was shot earlier, and have quoted a friend saying they were in a critical condition.

His family arrived shortly after, and were escorted by lawyers to consult doctors about his condition A video is circulating which appears to show a man being shot at extremely short range.

It followed reports that protesters were working to unlock doors believed to lead into the legislative council complex. Quartz\u2019s Mary Hui is on the ground in Wanchai, where protesters are dispersing after riot police moved in. Labour party legislative council member Fernando Cheung is followed and pushed by police in Admiralty. The latest photos we have from Hong Kong. In a major escalation in their use of force, police appear to have hit a protestor with a live round for the first time. The protestor was injured in the chest; video shared by local Standnews website apparently showed him begging for medical help as he bled on the street. \u201cSend me to hospital, my chest is hurting. I need to go to hospital\u201d. Hong Kong police have previously caused severe injuries with rubber bullets and beanbag rounds, including to the eyes of a protestor and a journalist. However until today, they had only fired live rounds in warning. The police have been criticised by Amnesty International for excessive use of force on protestors Reports of the number of live rounds fired today have grown to five, as details of the shootings emerge. Clearly, we are seeing an escalation of both the protesters\u2019 methods and the police response. Separately, a video is circulating which shows a woman being slapped as she is held to the ground by police. Crowds have fallen silent at Admiralty, after reports that a protester was shot with a live round.

Dozens of police officers formed a security cordon, backed by a water cannon truck, to prevent protesters from advancing to Beijing\u2019s liaison office in the city. Battles between hundreds of black-clad protesters and police occurred in multiple locations, turning streets into battlefields. Police fired multiple rounds of tear gas at the Wong Tai Sin, Sha Tin, Tsuen Wan and Tuen Mun areas as protesters hurled gas bombs, bricks and other objects in their direction. Police said protesters used corrosive fluid in Tuen Mun, injuring officers and some reporters. The city was already under tight security, and more subway stations were shuttered as the violence spread. Earlier, protesters paved the streets of central Hong Kong with fake bank notes they usually use at funerals, tossing wads of them into the air as they marched in black. The notes, many marked \u201cHell Bank Note,\u201d were a vivid expression of what many protesters say feels like a day of mourning for them as Communist leaders in Beijing celebrate 70 years in power. Like outsized confetti, tens of thousands of the notes covered a broad thoroughfare where a vast and swelling crowd tens of thousands strong marched, shouting \u201cFight for freedom.\u201d Protesters brought shopping bags full of giant wads of the notes and passed them out in the crowd. Marcher Ray Luk said as he and his mother tossed notes into the air, \u201cThe leaders who won\u2019t listen to our voice, this is for them.\u201d In the crowd, a protester also blew a bamboo trumpet traditionally heard at funerals and weddings, leading the crowd as it sang \u201cGlory to Hong Kong,\u201d an anthem of the protests. Around 3pm, protesters found that some riot police were hiding inside the closed Wanchai metro station and started throwing objects into the station. People jeered at riot police who occupied the footbridge outside the police headquarters. Protesters spray painted slogans on tram stops, along with shops perceived as pro-Beijing. There are 18 metro stations now closed, according to reports.

They suppress all opposition voices.\u201d Elsewhere, in Tuen Mun, police have been attacked by demonstrators. Police have issued a statement condemning the violence. \u201cRioters have used corrosive fluid in Tuen Mun area, injuring multiple police officers and reporters.\u201d Nearby, police have fired tear gas after protesters threw petrol bombs, according to the South China Morning Press. Hello everyone, this is Mattha Busby picking up the blog from my colleagues Martin Farrer and Naaman Zhou in Australia, on the 70th anniversary of Communist China\u2019s founding. It is just after 3pm local time in Hong Kong, where thousands of protesters have been marking the \u201cDay of Grief\u201d in defiance of a police ban. Officers have fired tear gas and used \u201cappropriate force\u201d to disperse demonstrators on Lung Cheung Road in Wong Tai Sin, and people have been warned to leave the sites of protests \u201cto leave the scene as soon as possible\u201d. This is from AFP: Police fanned out across Hong Kong on Tuesday in a bid to deter pro-democracy protests as the city marked communist China\u2019s 70th birthday, with local officials watching a flag-raising ceremony behind closed doors because of security concerns. Authorities ramped up security checks ahead of the anniversary and announced the closure of more than a dozen subway stations as officers conducted stop and searches in the streets and on public transport. The international finance hub is on edge as protesters vow to overshadow Beijing\u2019s festivities, stepping up their nearly four months of protests pushing for greater democratic freedoms and police accountability. Sunday witnessed some of the most sustained clashes in weeks between police and hardcore protesters. Activists have called for people to hit the streets for a \u201cDay of Grief\u201d - although police banned a proposed rally through the city. In a vivid illustration of the political insecurity now coursing through Hong Kong, city officials watched a morning harbourside flag-raising ceremony from the safety of the nearby convention centre. Since Hong Kong\u2019s 1997 handover to China by Britain, officials had always attended the ceremony outside, even during torrential downpours. But popular protests that erupted in June have made it increasingly risky for officials to appear in public. We are going to pause our live coverage for the time being. You can read our wrap of the news from a momentous day in Beijing and Hong Kong here: While Beijing celebrated, Hong Kong mourns: Here are some scenes from the streets of Hong Kong: One feature of the protests is that many people are stretching out five fingers to symbolise their five key demands. These are: The complete withdrawal of the proposed extradition bill The government to withdraw the use of the word \u201criot\u201d in relation to protests The unconditional release of arrested protesters and charges against them dropped An independent inquiry into police behaviour Implementation of genuine universal suffrage Protester James Ma added that \u201cthey didn\u2019t listen to us when we were peaceful\u201d. He added that the arrests of a number of people, including well known activists and ordinary protesters on the eve of the protest today, came after leader Carrie Lam\u2019s first community dialogues which promised to listen to ordinary people\u2019s voices. And talking of Carrie Lam, she\u2019s looking quite happy to be out of Hong Kong and in Beijing for the big celebration:look who\u2019s smiling now: Verna has been speaking to marchers in Causeway Bay. They say they are not afraid, even though the government banned the protest and pulled out all the stops to prevent people from turning up. These tactics included closing metro stations, blocking roads and diverting buses. A protester who identified himself as James Ma, said: \u201cThe more they crackdown, the more we need to come out because it\u2019s our freedom to protest.\u201d Asked whether he was worried about being arrested for the unsanctioned protest, he said he was not afraid: \u201cHong Kong people will not be defeated.\u201d Hello everyone. I\u2019m Martin Farrer taking over from Naaman Zhou. The Causeway Bay protest is a lively gathering. Our reporter on the scene, Verna Yu, says there are thousands of people in attendance, many of them dressed in black. They are shouting slogans including \u201cFight for freedom, Stand with Hong Kong\u201d and \u201cNo rioters, only violent regimes\u201d. Many are also sporting the Guy Fawkes-style masks popularised during the Occupy protests a few years back. Reuters reports that Taiwan\u2019s government has condemned China\u2019s \u201cdictatorship\u201d, saying the country was a threat to peace and trying to find excuses for its military expansion: Taiwan\u2019s Mainland Affairs Council, responding to the parade and Xi\u2019s comments, said Taiwan would never accept \u201cone country, two systems\u201d, the model of supposedly high autonomy Hong Kong and Macau have, which Beijing sees as eventually being the best way to win Taiwan over. \u201cThe Chinese Communist Party has persisted with its one-party dictatorship for 70 years, a concept of governance that violates the values **of democracy, freedom and human rights, causing risks and challenges for the development of mainland China,\u201d it said. \u201cIts shouting about the struggle for unity, great rejuvenation and unification is only an excuse for military expansion, seriously threatening regional peace and world democracy and civilisation.\u201d Taiwan has been democratic for more than 30 years, and China should use this moment to reflect and push for democracy, it added. \u201cThe lifeline of the survival and development of mainland China is not tied to one person and one party,\u201d the council said. The South China Morning Post are reporting that an unapproved rally in Sham Shui Po has been closed due to government sign declaring a \u201cspecial incident\u201d. With that, I will be handing over the blog to my colleague Martin Farrer. Protests and parades have marked China\u2019s 70th anniversary of Communist party rule. In Beijing, president Xi Jinping declared \u201cNo force can shake this great nation\u201d, amidst the protests in Hong Kong and a trade war with the US. Xi said he was committed to \u201cpeaceful reunification and one country, two systems\u201d for Hong Kong and Macau, and \u201cpeace\u201d and \u201creunification\u201d with Taiwan. A huge military parade showcased new weapons technology \u2013 including nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles and supersonic drones. In Hong Kong, protestors gathered for marches planned for this afternoon. Activists also staged a demonstration in the morning, even as streets and subway stations were closed. Hundreds have gathered in the city despite some protests being banned by police. Activist Joshua Wong called on the world to use the day to \u201cfight against authoritarianism\u201d and pressure governments and companies to reconsider their relationship with China. Protesters are gathering in a range of places across the city \u2013 not just Causeway Bay. There are 100 at the Southorn Playground in Wan Chai, as estimated by the South China Morning Post. Others are gathering in Wong Tai Sin Square. And at the Sha Tsui Playground in Tsuen Wan, there is an authorised rally planned for 1pm local time. Large crowds are gathering in Causeway Bay, fingers outstretched to represent the five core demands of protesters. And here\u2019s a sign from earlier today at a separate protest outside the British consulate. Around the city, riot police are also gathering. The focus now turns to Hong Kong, where multiple pro-democracy protests are planned across the city this afternoon. The parade is now over, bringing an end to nearly three hours of speeches and military procession. There was also a robot in the parade. This float represented Liaoning province, known for its industry. In Hong Kong, protesters gather for one of the marches. This one is scheduled to start at 1pm local time \u2013 which is in 20 minutes. Back in Beijing a float representing Hong Kong and Macau has rolled through, with the sign \u201cHong Kong will have a better tomorrow\u201d. Inside an empty mall in Hong Kong. Overnight, Reuters in Hong Kong reported that there was a contingent of China\u2019s People Armed Police (PAP) in the city for the first time. Last month, China had moved troops into the city as part of what was said to be a routine rotation. Sources told Reuters that this included PAP, which had not been reported at the time, in their first significant entry into Hong Kong. In Beijing, a tribute now to the 2008 Beijing Olympics. There is a protest march planned for Hong Kong today, from Causeway Bay to Central. It has been banned by police, but many say they will march anyway. Crowds have begun gathering near the Sogo department store ahead of the demonstration. Protesters in Hong Kong have hung this banner up outside the British consulate. \u201cNot my national day\u201d, it says. \u201cProud to be British since 1841\u201d The civilian portion of the parade is well underway. A float with a portrait of Mao Zedong and other monuments roll through the square. The military procession is now over. A huge choir takes over, singing in Tiananmen Square. Marchers are now carrying a giant Chinese flag, and bouquets of flowers. As the military parade continues in Beijing, Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong is tweeting and calling on the world to \u201cfight against authoritarianism\u201d. \u201cNo celebration,\u201d he writes. \u201cOnly demonstration\u201d \u201cUsing Hong Kong as a stepping stone, China is waving its claws at the free world...We, Hongkongers, are fighting not only for ourselves, but also for you and your country to safeguard the core values of the free world. He says to the world: \u201cReconsider your government\u2019s China-related policies and Chinese business involvement. Call on your government to exert diplomatic pressure on Beijing.\u201d In Hong Kong, Verna Yu reports: Hong Kong police have arrested a number of people ahead of the protest this afternoon. A protester told the Guardian that four people he knew were arrested from their homes this morning. Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) reported, citing police sources, that five people, including two students, were arrested late Monday night on suspicion of conspiracy to make offensive weapons. Police said they seized materials that can be used to make petrol bombs including thinner, naphtha, magnesium and aluminium powder, as well as glass bottles. Long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles, and nuclear missiles, are now rolling across Tiananmen Square. Now, the first public appearance of a new inter-continental ballistic missile, the DF-17. State TV commentators say it has \u201csmall to medium range\u201d capacity. Other missiles follow, capable of nuclear and conventional warheads, state media says. The drone team is now out. We are up to three different formations, large and small, mounted on the back of trucks. Before that were telecommunications vehicles. A slightly more complete list of some of those military units. We saw the air defense and anti-missile echelon, the early warning command echelon, bombers, carrier-based aircraft, fighter aircraft and land air assault echelons \u2013 and others. According to China Daily, two female generals participated in the parade for the first time ever. In Hong Kong, streets are mostly empty and main protest areas have been blocked off. Chief executive Carrie Lam is in Beijing today, and watching proceedings among other officials. Now researchers, military scientists and some of China\u2019s UN peacekeepers march past. Those female soldiers \u2013 wearing miniskirts \u2013 are some of the first women we\u2019ve seen in today\u2019s official broadcast. China has never had a woman on the politburo standing committee. Hundreds of members of the military are marching through Tiananmen Square. So far we have had the airforce, logistics support, the PLA armed police and a group of female soldiers. Xi, earlier, in his open-top car Now the military parade begins. Troops will start filing down Chang\u2019an Avenue soon. Xi has returned to the podium to watch. Helicopters fly overhead with the Chinese flag, arranged to form a big \u201c70\u201d. Fighter jets, large planes and what could be the new supersonic drone are now taking off. They will soon pass over Tiananmen Square. Reminder that according to state news outlets \u2013 40% of what we are seeing today is being unveiled for the first time. Xi continues his return to the square, behind him is commander-in-chief of the parade and commander-in-chief of the central war zone Yi Xiaoguang. Earlier, he was greeting soldiers with \u201cHello comrades\u201d and \u201cThanks for your hard work\u201d. Some images from earlier, during Xi\u2019s speech. The car is now turning around and Xi is returning to Tiananmen Square. The troops shout military slogans. Xi is still driving down Chang\u2019an Avenue, greeting the military arranged along the road, who greet him in turn. Xi wraps up his address with a call for unity, across all Chinese people, including ethnic minorities, to work together and \u201ccontinue to consolidate and develop our People\u2019s Republic\u201d. \u201cChina\u2019s yesterday has been written in the annals of mankind. China is now being created by millions of people. China\u2019s tomorrow will surely be better. Our whole party will endeavour to unite and not not forget our mission. We\u2019ll bolster the People\u2019s Republic and development to struggle for the revival of the great Chinese dream.\u201d He signs off, saying \u201cLong live the CPC and the Chinese people\u201d. Xi is then taken to an open-top car and driven down Chang\u2019an Avenue. And on international matters, Xi says: \u201cWe must remain committed to the path of peaceful development and pursue the strategy of win-win co-operation. And continue to jointly build a community of common destiny for all mankind with people across the world.\u201d He adds the Chinese military will \u201cresolutely protect world peace\u201d. \u201cThe People\u2019s Liberation Army of China and the People\u2019s Armed Police Force will forever retain the characters, purposes and the nature of being the people\u2019s military,\u201d he says. On Hong Kong: \u201cForging ahead, we must remain committed to the strategy of peaceful reunification and one country, two systems. We will maintain the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and Macau. On Taiwan: \u201c[We must] advance the peaceful development of cross-strait relations and continue to strive for the complete reunification of our country.\u201d He turns to economic matters now, striking a bullish note on Chinese development. \u201cThere is no force that can shake the foundation of this great nation,\u201d he says. \u201cNo force can stop the Chinese people and the Chinese nation forging ahead.\u201d Xi Jinping begins with a tribute to \u201crevolutionary heroes and martyrs\u201d and opening remarks with a heavy emphasis on China\u2019s ethnic minotiries. \u201cAt this moment, people of all ethnic groups in China, and Chinese men and woman all over the world are filled with great joy and happiness. Proud of this great country. and sending good wishes to our great motherland.\u201d \u201cLet me extend a thanks to friends of all nations who have supported china\u2019s development,\u201d he adds. President Xi is about to speak. The flag is raised on Tiananmen Square and the crowd sings the national anthem. Soldiers are slowly march across the square to the flagpole, the giant portrait of Sun-Yat Sen looks on. Premier Li Keqiang has announced the anniversary has commenced. There is a ceremonial firing of cannons \u2013 with 56 cannons representing China\u2019s 56 ethnic groups. They\u2019re firing them 70 times to mark the anniversary. Xi Jinping has emerged on the balcony on the Gate of Heavenly Peace. He\u2019s accompanied by Politburo figures and former presidents Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao. The first live footage of the parade and the military in Tiananmen Square is coming through now. A helicopter shot over Chang\u2019an Avenue shows it packed with tanks and trucks in formation. \u201cThis event is bigger than usual,\u201d say anchors on state broadcaster CGTN. According to the state outlet Global Times, today\u2019s parade will feature 15,000 soldiers and 160 aircraft. 580 pieces of military equipment will be on show, forty percent of which have never been shown in public. Here are some images of parade attendees in the traditional dress of some of China\u2019s many ethnic minorities \u2013 a common sight for choreographed state celebrations like this. Earlier today, Ilham Tohti, a Uygur academic currently in prison in China, was awarded a European human rights prize. Tothi, who was sentenced to life in prison in 2014, was awarded the Vaclav Havel Human Rights Prize in Strasbourg. He had earlier won the Martin Ennals award for human rights defenders in 2016. More pictures of the preparation here: State news outlet People\u2019s Daily has posted this video of the preparations. Tanks and trucks stretch as far as the eye can see. But there\u2019s also a fair amount of smog in the sky \u2013 odd, as officials usually enforce pollution control measures, and deploy cloud-seeding to clear things up in the lead-up to big events . Verna Yu in Hong Kong: Three metro stations: Admiralty, Wanchai and Prince Edward are closed all day, and eight more stations across Hong Kong, in districts that have been flash points of recent protests, will also be closed from 11am, said the Transport Department, Here is our scene-setter for today, laying out some of the global challenges facing China at the moment: And the latest on the situation in Hong Kong, where at least two high-profile activists, Ventus Lau and actor Gregory Wong, were arrested in the lead-up to today. The parade is scheduled to begin at 10am in Beijing. Which is in one hour. From Verna Yu in Hong Kong: Acting chief executive Matthew Cheung, who is deputising for Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam, who is in Beijing participating in the National Day celebration, said in his speech that the government was \u201cshocked and saddened\u201d by the increasingly violent protests and said \u201cviolence is not a solution\u201d. He said the government has started a series of community dialogues and is looking into programmes to improve the livelihood for ordinary citizens. After his speech, he toasted other dignitaries on the stage, who include China\u2019s representatives and the People\u2019s Liberation Army\u2019s commanders. In Beijing, security forces have cleared the streets. One of the Guardian\u2019s correspondents in Hong Kong, Verna Yu, wites: As the flag raising ceremony started at 8am local time, a dozen protesters staged a demonstration in Wanchai in the presence of riot police. \u201cRise up! The people who don\u2019t want to be slaves!\u201d they chanted, echoing the words of the Chinese national anthem. Guests watched the flag raising ceremony from a screen inside the convention and exhibition centre as the reception for the national day celebration has been moved indoors this year out of fears of disruption by activists. The flag raising ceremony has taken place outdoors in past years. The protesters displayed a black banner emblazoned: \u201cThere is no national celebration, only national mourning. End one party rule.\u201d In Hong Kong, protests have already begun. Good morning and welcome to our coverage of the 70th anniversary of Communist party rule in China. Analysts are expecting a show of military might today, with tanks, troops, missiles and a new hypersonic drone to feature in Beijing as a military parade rolls through Tiananmen Square. There will also be an address from president Xi Jinping. And corresponding protests are ramping up in Hong Kong, even as authorities crack down and arrest activists both in the city and on the mainland.

He has been fired. \u201cAs the chosen provider of walking vendors across dozens of stadiums, we take the matter of security extremely seriously, and train and monitor our vendors to safeguard our customers,\u201d Rocket Man told the Miami Herald. \u201cOur onsite supervisor contacted the authorities immediately upon learning of the overcharge on what was Mr Collier\u2019s unauthorized personal device.\u201d The Dolphins lost Sunday\u2019s game 30-10. They have lost all four of their games this season, and many believe they may not win a game this year. The Hard Rock Stadium will host this season\u2019s Super Bowl.",

      "bodyText": "Robin Hood Energy, the energy supplier owned by Nottingham city council, has failed to pass on \u00a39.5m in renewable energy subsidies after collecting them from customers through their bills. The supplier has already claimed the sum from its customers, to be used to support renewable energy projects, but missed the deadline to pay its share of the money to the industry regulator, Ofgem last month. Ofgem has said the troubled energy supplier could have its supply licence revoked if it fails to pay by the end of October. In total, four of the energy suppliers - Delta Gas and Power, Gnergy, Toto Energy and Robin Hood - could lose their licences if they fail to pay a total of \u00a314.7m to the government\u2019s renewable support scheme. Robin Hood, set up in 2015, owes the largest sum of money followed by Toto Energy which owes \u00a34.5m. Mary Starks, the executive director at Ofgem, said it is \u201cunacceptable\u201d for suppliers to shirk the renewable energy payments, and warned that suppliers \u201cmust meet their obligations, or pay the consequences\u201d which could mean losing their licence. Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice, the consumer watchdog, said that if the energy suppliers fail to pay, it would be customers who end up picking up the tab through higher bills. \u201cThis is not a new problem.

The latest blow to the authority-owned energy supplier comes after years of financial losses, and fears the company may collapse. The council-owned supplier\u2019s struggle to weather the fierce competition in the energy market also raises doubts over Labour\u2019s energy plans for a public energy supplier in every region. Robin Hood made an annual loss of \u00a3713,000 in 2015, followed by losses of \u00a32.5m in 2016 and \u00a37.2m in 2017.

They are only about whether the advice given by the prime minister to Her Majesty the Queen on 27 or 28 August, that parliament should be prorogued from a date between 9 and 12 September until 14 October, was lawful and the legal consequences if it was not.\u201d</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>That the court had the right to act</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u201cThe first question is whether the lawfulness of the prime minister\u2019s advice to Her Majesty is justiciable. This court holds that it is. The courts have exercised a supervisory jurisdiction over the lawfulness of acts of the government for centuries.\u201c</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>That the prorogation was not \u2018normal\u2019</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u201cIt prevented parliament from carrying out its constitutional role for five out of the possible eight weeks between the end of the summer recess and exit day on 31 October. Proroguing parliament is quite different from parliament going into recess. While parliament is prorogued, neither house can meet, debate or pass legislation. Neither house can debate government policy. Nor may members ask written or oral questions of ministers or meet and take evidence in committees\u2026This prolonged suspension of parliamentary democracy took place in quite exceptional circumstances: the fundamental change which was due to take place in the constitution of the United Kingdom on 31 October. Parliament, and in particular the House of Commons as the elected representatives of the people, has a right to a voice in how that change comes about. The effect upon the fundamentals of our democracy was extreme.\u201d</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>That Boris Johnson\u2019s advice to the Queen was unlawful</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u201cThe court is bound to conclude, therefore, that the decision to advise Her Majesty to prorogue parliament was unlawful because it had the effect of frustrating or preventing the ability of parliament to carry out its constitutional functions without reasonable justification.\u201c</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>That parliament has not been prorogued</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u201cThis court has already concluded that the prime minister\u2019s advice to Her Majesty was unlawful, void and of no effect. This means that the order in council to which it led was also unlawful, void and of no effect and should be quashed. This means that when the royal commissioners walked into the House of Lords it was as if they walked in with a blank sheet of paper. The prorogation was also void and of no effect. Parliament has not been prorogued. This is the unanimous judgment of all 11 Justices.\u201d</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What happens next?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u201cIt is for parliament, and in particular the Speaker and the Lord Speaker, to decide what to do next. Unless there is some parliamentary rule of which we are unaware, they can take immediate steps to enable each house to meet as soon as possible. It is not clear to us that any step is needed from the prime minister, but if it is, the court is pleased that his counsel have told the court that he will take all necessary steps to comply with the terms of any declaration made by this court.\u201d</p>\n    <p><i>The <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2019-0192-judgment.pdf\">full judgment</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2019-0192-summary.pdf\">summary judgment</a> can be downloaded from the Supreme court website.</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>David Gauke, the rebel former cabinet minister, has predicted there would also be legal challenges in the English courts if Johnson refused to uphold the Benn Act.</p> \n<p>Maugham said time was now running out; there were only 13 court sitting days until the 19 October deadline.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe want it all determined before 19 October because a delay for the prime minister could be as good as a refusal [of our motion],\u201d he said. \u201cWe are acting now to ensure he faces the consequences if he breaches the obligation placed upon him by parliament.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson could be ordered by a Scottish judge to delay Brexit after pro-remain campaigners secured an emergency court hearing for this Friday. The campaigners have asked the court of session in Edinburgh to issue an interdict, or injunction, which would force the prime minister to ask the EU for an extension to article 50 if he fails to get a new deal passed at Westminster by 19 October. Lord Pentland, the judge, said he would hear the case on Friday and issue his ruling on Monday, which is likely to trigger appeals that will end with a fresh UK supreme court hearing within the next three weeks. The European Union (Withdrawal) (No 2) Act 2019, known as the Benn Act, was passed by parliament last month and requires the government to ask for an extension until 31 January 2020 if no deal is agreed, but Downing Street officials have repeatedly suggested they will try to thwart the legislation. Asked last week whether Johnson would uphold the statute\u2019s requirements, Downing Street said: \u201cWe will comply with the law, but we are leaving on 31 October.\u201d The campaigners have also asked the court to bar the government from writing separately to EU leaders asking them to refuse the extension request, after it was reported No 10 may do so to try to thwart the Benn Act. The case has been brought by Jolyon Maugham QC, an anti-Brexit legal campaigner, and Joanna Cherry QC, a Scottish National party MP, who were both involved in last week\u2019s supreme court ruling which said Johnson had prorogued parliament unlawfully, and has been funded by the green energy entrepreneur Dale Vince. Pentland, an outer house judge, could issue or reject the interdict on Monday, or he could rule that the case has to be heard and decided by the inner house, the senior tier of the court of session, which is Scotland\u2019s civil court. Vince\u2019s legal action was originally due to be heard by the inner house next Tuesday because it has a power unique within the UK to take action if someone refuses to do something they are legally obliged to do. That authority is known as the nobile officium, and Vince, Maugham and Cherry are likely to ask the inner house to use those powers to write to the EU seeking the extension on the prime minister\u2019s behalf if he refuses to do so. Pentland\u2019s decision came after some hasty legal manoeuvring by Vince\u2019s legal team. They had learned that the government\u2019s lawyers were planning to argue next week that the case should have been heard first in the outer house, where Pentland sits. That would have delayed their case, so in an effort to prevent that happening, Vince\u2019s lawyers applied on Monday for an urgent hearing in the outer house to ensure it was dealt with urgently in that tier. Whichever side loses is likely to appeal directly to the supreme court, setting the scene for further constitutional turmoil after 11 supreme court judges ruled unanimously that Johnson\u2019s suspension of parliament was \u201cunlawful, void and of no effect\u201d. David Gauke, the rebel former cabinet minister, has predicted there would also be legal challenges in the English courts if Johnson refused to uphold the Benn Act. Maugham said time was now running out; there were only 13 court sitting days until the 19 October deadline. \u201cWe want it all determined before 19 October because a delay for the prime minister could be as good as a refusal [of our motion],\u201d he said. \u201cWe are acting now to ensure he faces the consequences if he breaches the obligation placed upon him by parliament.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "After 30 years of recommendations, five years of intense lobbying, three years of funding negotiations and two years of political promises, a lifesaving service that could prevent deaths in custody has been rolled out across Western Australia. The custody notification service (CNS) has been trialled since July and went statewide at 12.01am on Wednesday. It places a mandatory requirement on police who take an Indigenous person into custody for any reason, including protective custody provisions for intoxication or under the Mental Health Act, to call a 24/7 hotline staffed by the Aboriginal Legal Service (ALSWA). It is based on the New South Wales CNS that has been operational for 19 years. It was also a recommendation of the 1991 royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody. The family of Yamatji woman Ms Dhu, who died after suffering a critical health decline in a Port Hedland police cell after being jailed for unpaid fines in 2014, campaigned for a CNS in WA for five years. An inquest heard it could have saved her life. Legislation to end the practice of jailing for unpaid fines was introduced to parliament last week. ALSWA chief executive Dennis Eggington said the service would be staffed by \u201can incredible team who have undergone a rigorous expert training program in many areas including cultural awareness, relevant legal issues, mental health, disability, suicide prevention and trauma-informed practice\u201d. The scheme costs $1m a year and is jointly funded, with commonwealth funding of $2.7m over three years. The Northern Territory received the same funding. Legislation to create a Victorian custody notification service came into effect on Tuesday. The Victorian laws require police to ask everyone they arrest if they identify as an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person, and to contact the Victoria Aboriginal Legal Service within the hour of taking an Indigenous person into custody for any reason. It replaces a non-mandatory scheme that has been in place since the early 1990s and will be staffed by volunteers from the expanded Aboriginal community justice panel program. \u201cA Custodial Notification Scheme can prevent deaths and injuries in custody \u2013 that\u2019s why we\u2019ve enshrined one in legislation,\u201d Victorian attorney-general Jill Hennessy said. An investigation by Guardian Australia found that at least 424 Indigenous people have died in custody in Australia in the 30 years since the royal commission. Only one Aboriginal person, Wiradjuri woman Rebecca Maher, has died in a police station in NSW since the introduction of the CNS. A coronial inquest into Maher\u2019s death recommended NSW expand the service to include intoxicated people held under protective custody laws. South Australia, Queensland and Tasmania are the only states without the mandatory notification scheme.",

      "bodyText": "The Australian corporate regulator says it provided information to American authorities to assist in prosecuting an insider trading case against the Trump-supporting congressman Christopher Collins. Collins, the first congressman to publicly support Donald Trump during the 2016 campaign, resigned on Monday ahead of an appearance in court on Tuesday when he was expected to plead guilty to insider trading charges related to an Australian biotech company where he was a director and one of the largest shareholders. The company, Innate Immunotherapeutics, was developing a treatment for multiple sclerosis, but its share price plunged 92% in June 2017 when it revealed the drug had failed a crucial trial. A spokesman for the Australian Securities and Investments Commission said the regulator provided data about trading in Innate, and other supporting information, to the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Collins, a Republican from New York, allegedly learned of the trial\u2019s failure on the evening of 22 June 2017, while he was attending a congressional picnic hosted by Trump on the South Lawn of the White House. He and other board members were emailed the bad news by the company\u2019s chief executive. According to court documents, 15 minutes later Collins responded: \u201cWow. Makes no sense. How are these results even possible???\u201d It is alleged that within a minute of sending this email, Collins began calling his son Cameron, who also owned millions of Innate shares, to tell him the drug trial had failed. According to court documents, father and son missed each other six times over four minutes, but eventually the call connected. TV cameras caught Collins on the phone at the picnic. At the time, Australian investors were not able to buy or sell Innate stock on the ASX, where it was listed, because it had gone into a trading halt ahead of announcing the trial had failed. However, early the following morning Cameron Collins, who has also been charged, allegedly began selling his stake on the US secondary \u201cover the counter\u201d or \u201cpink slips\u201d market. He allegedly sold about 1.3m shares, avoiding about US$570,000 in losses when the company came out of its trading halt and the stock price tumbled. Cameron Collins is also accused of tipping off his girlfriend and members of her family, none of whom are charged with any crime, that the drug had failed. In a related civil case, the SEC claims it was Cameron Collins who convinced the family to get into the stock in the first place. \u201cI think we all need to consider investing in innate therapeutics,\u201d his girlfriend told her mother in an August 2016 text message, court documents show. She said a US$15,000 investment had a more than 50% chance of ballooning to $250,000. \u201cThat is actually unheard of and cams dad almost guarantees it within the next 1 to 2 years,\u201d she said in the text message. In further text messages sent to her mother over the following days she said that \u201cwe\u2019ll always keep in touch with cams dad who I\u2019m guessing would know how things are looking as we get closer to the end of the trial\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure cams dad keeps us in the loop,\u201d she said. Collins resigned from the Innate board on 4 May last year. The company, which has been contacted for comment, has changed its name to Amplia Therapeutics and is now working on cancer and fibrosis treatments.",

One would always meet the people who felt displaced by immigrants; another would unfailingly meet the one who hated Jeremy Corbyn; and I would come back with a weird story about someone\u2019s daughter-in-law who was obsessed with colouring-in books, and it would turn out she had an anxiety disorder, and then it would transpire that she was on a zero-hours contract.</p> \n<p>The point is not that they were biased and I was neutral and this paper is better than all the others: it\u2019s interesting precisely because we unintentionally and in good faith dig for the stories we\u2019re interested in. It is, in the end, not an encounter between a scientist and a specimen \u2013 but two people trying to connect.

What\u2019s problematic is the politically expedient contention that there are opinions that are held by all members of a demographic group \u2013 from northerners, women, millennials, pensioners, all the way up to \u201cthe people\u201d.

One would always meet the people who felt displaced by immigrants; another would unfailingly meet the one who hated Jeremy Corbyn; and I would come back with a weird story about someone\u2019s daughter-in-law who was obsessed with colouring-in books, and it would turn out she had an anxiety disorder, and then it would transpire that she was on a zero-hours contract. The point is not that they were biased and I was neutral and this paper is better than all the others: it\u2019s interesting precisely because we unintentionally and in good faith dig for the stories we\u2019re interested in. It is, in the end, not an encounter between a scientist and a specimen \u2013 but two people trying to connect. What is produced is always idiosyncratic, and only revealing insofar as you\u2019re prepared to consider what it reveals about both sides of the encounter. This isn\u2019t to say that interviewing people is corrupted simply because the interviewers are human too. What\u2019s problematic is the politically expedient contention that there are opinions that are held by all members of a demographic group \u2013 from northerners, women, millennials, pensioners, all the way up to \u201cthe people\u201d. When we recognise that as a fallacy, we might finally be able to hear one another. \u2022 Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "A record number of homeless people died last year, in the biggest increase in deaths since reporting began, amid warnings fatalities are likely to be even higher in 2019. Charities and MPs have said austerity and cuts to services are driving a worsening homelessness crisis, as figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that an estimated 726 homeless people died in England and Wales in 2018. This is a 22% rise from 2017 and the biggest increase since the data was first collected in 2013. The shadow housing secretary, John Healey, asking an urgent question in the Commons about deaths among homeless people, said: \u201cThis shames us all \u2026 This demands a response from the prime minister himself tomorrow in his party conference speech.\u201d Jon Sparkes, the chief executive of the charity Crisis, said: \u201cIt is heartbreaking that hundreds of people were forced to spend the last days of their lives without the dignity of a secure home.\u201d His words were echoed by the housing minister Luke Hall: \u201cThere is no shying away from these statistics. They are heartbreaking.\u201d Those collecting data for the Museum of Homelessness said the number of deaths for 2019 is likely to be even higher. \u201cWe do think that [from what we have recorded so far] we will really see an increase again, so the picture will get bleaker,\u201d said Jessica Turtle, co-founder of the Museum of Homelessness. The biggest increase was in drug-related deaths, which rose by 55% compared with 2017. Figures showed there were 131 deaths related to opiate poisoning, predominantly involving heroin and morphine. There was also a doubling in deaths related to cocaine, increasing from 15 in 2017 to 30 in 2018. Further concern has also been raised about the dangers of substances such as the synthetic cannabinoid spice, also known as black mamba, which experts say is ravaging vulnerable communities. \u201cIt features in quite a few of the stories we have been researching \u2026 also from our work on the ground \u2026 a lot of people have overdosed on spice,\u201d Turtle said. She said that making psychoactive substances illegal in May 2016 had made the situation worse, driving spice into an underground market that produced a stronger blend of the drug. Turtle said people were mainly dying from drug and alcohol misuse, which is directly linked to a cut in services. \u201cA lot of these deaths are preventable,\u201d she said. She said austerity was having a direct impact, citing an example in Middlesbrough, where it was reported this year that homeless people had died since a council redeployed staff helping them. A council team had provided \u201cintensive support\u201d for rough sleepers but its three staff were moved in April. At a cafe for homeless people in Middlesbrough, Susan Gill said nine of her regulars had died since April. Gill, who runs the Neighbourhood Welfare homeless hub, said the future for homeless people in the area was \u201cincredibly bleak\u201d. \u201cI have literally just had someone taken away in an ambulance because he had overdosed,\u201d she said. \u201cThey come in here for a warm meal and some tea but their lives are so chaotic. They are just desperate and there is no help out there. Some don\u2019t want help but others really, really do and that\u2019s why it is so tragic because we can save them if we just tried.\u201d Gill said the introduction of universal credit had plunged many into poverty, leaving them vulnerable to homelessness and mental health problems. \u201cSometimes they deliberately turn to drugs and take overdoses because there is literally no hope for them. We need more services which intervene before they get to that point, the point where they decide they can\u2019t come back,\u201d she said.

Liam Byrne, the Labour MP for Birmingham Hodge Hill, said: \u201cThis is a moral emergency and none of us can continue to stand by \u2013 we need urgent action.\u201d Most of the deaths in 2018 were among men, accounting for 641 estimated deaths and 88% of the total. The mean age at death was 45 years for men and 43 for women, far lower than for the general population, which is 76 years and 81 years for men and women respectively. Two in five deaths of homeless people were related to drug poisoning in 2018 (294 estimated deaths), and the number of deaths from this has increased by 55% since 2017. London and the north-west had the highest numbers of deaths in 2018, with 148 (20% of the total number) and 103 (14% of the total number) estimated deaths of homeless people respectively. The figures included rough sleepers and people using emergency accommodation such as shelters and hostels. A government spokesperson said: \u201cEvery single death on our streets is one too many and these statistics are a sombre reminder that there is still much more to do to tackle homelessness and end rough sleeping for good. \u201cDrugs can devastate lives, ruin families and damage communities, which is why we are undertaking a comprehensive review which will help protect the most vulnerable \u2013 including homeless individuals \u2013 from the harm that drugs cause and give them a chance to recover and turn their lives around.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Hong Kong police have shot a protester with live ammunition for the first time in four months of demonstrations, marking a major escalation in the use of force on a day when China celebrated 70 years of Communist party rule with a triumphalist military parade. Protests called to mark a \u201cnational day of grief\u201d drew tens of thousands of people on to the city\u2019s streets, across six areas, in the most widespread show yet of public anger towards Beijing. Some gathered in central Hong Kong, while others met up across the harbour in Kowloon and the New Territories beyond. Initially peaceful, the demonstrations turned into running battles that in some places ran on past midnight. Authorities shut down nearly half the city\u2019s metro stations in an attempt to contain the violence. Police in full riot gear used water cannon and barrages of teargas, while protesters threw molotov cocktails, built barricades, attacked metro stations and lit fires in the street. The scenes, though extremely violent, did not mark a departure from previous protests until mid-afternoon, when a policeman fired a bullet into an 18-year-old high school student\u2019s chest in Tsuen Wan district. Images shared by local media showed the protester lying on the ground begging for help as he bled from his injury. \u201cSend me to hospital, my chest is hurting. I need to go to hospital,\u201d he said. Although warning shots have been fired during other protests, police have caused serious injury with rubber bullets and beanbag rounds, and groups including Amnesty International have condemned excessive use of force, this was the first time someone has been hit with a live round. A video posted by the Hong Kong University Students Union appeared to show the policeman shooting the student at point blank range with a pistol, as a group of protesters attacked another officer. Commissioner of police Stephen Lo Wai-chung said the use of a live round was \u201clawful and reasonable\u201d, and the man had been arrested for assaulting a police officer after he was taken to hospital. The officer opened fire after protesters attacked a policeman who was lying on the ground, Lo told the SCMP. \u201cSo when an officer felt that officers\u2019 lives were under serious threat, he fired a live round.\u201d Six live rounds were fired in total during the protests on Tuesday, he added. The UK said the use of live ammunition was \u201cdisproportionate\u201d, while Amnesty International called for an urgent and independent investigation. Crowds gathered in central Hong Kong, where police were using water cannon and teargas, fell silent when they heard someone had been shot. But violence soon resumed, and in some places intensified, as protesters faced off with police into the evening. Later a journalist from the local RTHK network was taken to hospital after a projectile hit him in the face, prompting the network to withdraw all its reporters from the streets. Health authorities said at least 66 people were injured in protests, the youngest only 11 and the oldest 75. Two were in a critical condition, and two in a serious condition. Hong Kong has been gripped by protests since June. Sparked by a controversial extradition bill, they have morphed into a wider and increasingly violent anti-government movement channelling residents\u2019 anger and frustration at the erosion of rights under Chinese rule. Tuesday\u2019s marchers had already defied a police ban to turn out in large numbers. Organisers wanted to mark the 70th anniversary of communist China as a day of mourning not celebration, and tens of thousands came out in response. \u201cWe want to show people this is not a happy anniversary,\u201d said Richard Hung, who works in the technology sector. \u201cThe CCP [Chinese Communist party] has killed or injured so many millions of people already. We have come out today, because if we don\u2019t, we may not have another chance.\u201d For the first few hours, the main march through the city centre was peaceful, with protesters dressed largely in black singing \u201cglory to Hong Kong\u201d, scattering paper money used for funeral offerings, and scrawling protest slogans on streets, bus stations and shops seen as pro-Beijing. Graffiti included anti-China messages mocking the day\u2019s celebrations across the border, calls for freedom and democracy, and a warning with a prophetic ring that has become a protest staple: \u201cif you burn, we burn with you\u201d. Many families and young children were among the crowds at first. \u201cYou can see, we don\u2019t have any protective gear,\u201d said Terrence, a logistics worker walking with his eight-year-old daughter. \u201cWe want freedom, and don\u2019t want to belong to China.\u201d Still, a large proportion of protesters wore face masks or carried umbrellas, to stop them being filmed or identified by authorities who have already arrested hundreds. Some have been charged with rioting, which carries a sentence of up to 10 years. Police had said ahead of Tuesday that they feared violent protests, and made a string of raids and arrests, claiming to have uncovered bomb-making equipment and ingredients. Aggressive policing and the scale of the recent violence fuelled fears that authorities might use it as a pretext to bring in draconian emergency legislation, which would allow the government to arrest people at will, and control the press and communications, in the name of stability. \u201cIt seems there is no sign of this coming to an end until the government is determined to clamp down,\u201d said pro-Beijing lawmaker Junius Ho Kwan-yiu, who has previously called for an emergency law, in a statement carried by the South China Morning Post. The day began with an episode of police aggression, when officers used pepper spray on a small group of protesters outside the government\u2019s official flag-raising ceremony and national day reception, which was closed to the public. It was calm throughout the morning, as Beijing celebrated its anniversary and rise to super-power status with a military parade showing off its latest hardware, and a civilian procession celebrating everything from communist heroes to agriculture and bicycles. Hong Kong\u2019s protesters began turning out only after those events wrapped up, preparing their own response to mark the day. \u201cIt\u2019s National Day but there is nothing to be happy about in Hong Kong,\u201d said Sarah, 17. \u201cWe\u2019re under one party rule and the Communist party controls our government.\u201d",

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.<br></p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Nissan said its plans to build the Qashqai in Sunderland \u201chave not changed\u201d.</p> \n<p>But it added: \u201cToday we are among those companies with major investments in the UK who are still waiting for clarity on what the future trading relationship between the UK and the EU will look like.</p> \n<p>\u201cAs a sudden change from those rules to the rules of the World Trade Organisation will have serious implications for British industry, we urge UK and EU negotiators to work collaboratively towards an orderly balanced Brexit that will continue to encourage mutually beneficial trade.</p> \n<p>\u201cFrictionless trade has enabled the growth that has seen our Sunderland plant become the biggest factory in the history of the UK car industry, exporting more than half of its production to the EU.\u201d</p> \n<p>Theresa May\u2019s government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/04/government-letter-to-nissan-reveals-brexit-promise-to-carmarkers\">offered Nissan up to \u00a380m of state aid in 2016</a> to coax it into building new generations of the Qashqai and X-Trail in Sunderland.</p> \n<p>After initially appearing to have been convinced by the offer, the carmaker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/03/nissan-confirms-new-x-trail-will-not-be-built-in-sunderland\">eventually decided against</a> building the X-Trail there, citing Brexit among its chief concerns.</p> \n<p>In March, it said it would also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/mar/12/nissan-to-end-sunderland-production-of-luxury-infiniti-brand\">cease production of the Infiniti marque</a> at Sunderland, putting 250 jobs at risk, as it withdrew from the luxury sector in western Europe.</p> \n<p>It has also been retrenching in the face of dismal financial performance around the world, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/24/nissan-plans-to-shed-10000-jobs-worldwide-reports-claim\">announcing plans in July to cut up to 10,000 jobs</a>.</p> \n<p>Nissan is the latest in a long line of firms in the automotive sector to issue dire warnings about Brexit, or withdraw or pause investment in anticipation of it.</p> \n<p>Earlier this year, Honda announced plans to close its Swindon plant, initially insisting that Brexit had nothing to do with the decision.</p> \n<p>The claim was later undermined <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/21/honda-european-chief-outlined-no-deal-brexit-concerns-in-2018\">after the Guardian revealed</a> that the car company had briefed local people that Brexit posed a threat to the factory\u2019s future.</p> \n<p>Jaguar Land Rover, which is the UK\u2019s largest carmaker and employs 40,000 people, has previously warned that a hard Brexit could disrupt its investment plans and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/21/brexit-industries-ralf-speth-jaguar-land-rover-cbi-survey\">kill off entire industries</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Business email signup\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>At the Geneva motor show earlier this year, a string of carmakers including BMW, Toyota, Bentley and Peugeot maker PSA also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/mar/05/bmw-mini-cowley-no-deal-brexit-toyota\">voiced grave concerns</a>.</p> \n<p>One of the chief concerns in the industry, which employs more than 800,000 people in the UK, is the risk of disruption to \u201cjust in time\u201d manufacturing processes that ensure the smooth and swift flow of car parts across borders.</p> \n<p>Earlier this year, Boris Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/14/boris-johnson-dismisses-brexit-claims-of-jaguar-land-rover-boss\">dismissed concerns</a> about such disruption expressed by the Jaguar Land Rover chief executive, Ralf Speth, saying he was \u201cnot certain\u201d the Germany automotive veteran knew more than him about the industry.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Nissan could tear up plans to build its Qashqai model in Sunderland if the UK leaves the European Union without a deal, according to reports, putting a plant employing 7,000 people at risk of closure. The Japanese carmaker promised in 2016 to build the new version of the SUV in Sunderland, after receiving assurances from Theresa May\u2019s government that it would be protected from the impact of Brexit. But with the company in the midst of savage global job cuts due to poor financial performance, executives will revisit the plan if the UK leaves the EU without a deal at the end of the month, according to sources who spoke to the Financial Times. The Qashqai accounts for two-thirds of the 440,000 cars produced by Nissan in Sunderland each year, raising fears that the plant, which also makes the Juke and electric Leaf models, could close altogether. About 7,000 people work at the site. Nissan said its plans to build the Qashqai in Sunderland \u201chave not changed\u201d. But it added: \u201cToday we are among those companies with major investments in the UK who are still waiting for clarity on what the future trading relationship between the UK and the EU will look like. \u201cAs a sudden change from those rules to the rules of the World Trade Organisation will have serious implications for British industry, we urge UK and EU negotiators to work collaboratively towards an orderly balanced Brexit that will continue to encourage mutually beneficial trade. \u201cFrictionless trade has enabled the growth that has seen our Sunderland plant become the biggest factory in the history of the UK car industry, exporting more than half of its production to the EU.\u201d Theresa May\u2019s government offered Nissan up to \u00a380m of state aid in 2016 to coax it into building new generations of the Qashqai and X-Trail in Sunderland. After initially appearing to have been convinced by the offer, the carmaker eventually decided against building the X-Trail there, citing Brexit among its chief concerns. In March, it said it would also cease production of the Infiniti marque at Sunderland, putting 250 jobs at risk, as it withdrew from the luxury sector in western Europe. It has also been retrenching in the face of dismal financial performance around the world, announcing plans in July to cut up to 10,000 jobs. Nissan is the latest in a long line of firms in the automotive sector to issue dire warnings about Brexit, or withdraw or pause investment in anticipation of it. Earlier this year, Honda announced plans to close its Swindon plant, initially insisting that Brexit had nothing to do with the decision. The claim was later undermined after the Guardian revealed that the car company had briefed local people that Brexit posed a threat to the factory\u2019s future. Jaguar Land Rover, which is the UK\u2019s largest carmaker and employs 40,000 people, has previously warned that a hard Brexit could disrupt its investment plans and kill off entire industries. At the Geneva motor show earlier this year, a string of carmakers including BMW, Toyota, Bentley and Peugeot maker PSA also voiced grave concerns. One of the chief concerns in the industry, which employs more than 800,000 people in the UK, is the risk of disruption to \u201cjust in time\u201d manufacturing processes that ensure the smooth and swift flow of car parts across borders. Earlier this year, Boris Johnson dismissed concerns about such disruption expressed by the Jaguar Land Rover chief executive, Ralf Speth, saying he was \u201cnot certain\u201d the Germany automotive veteran knew more than him about the industry.",

The \u201cbackstop\u201d is intended as a standstill placeholder to ensure such checks do not have to be imposed between Brexit happening with a deal, and the start of a new free trade agreement yet to be negotiated between the UK and the EU.</p>\n    <p>Theresa May's withdrawal agreement proposed keeping the whole of the UK in a shared customs territory with the EU during this period. An alternative idea involves only Northern Ireland staying in the EU\u2019s customs territory. That would place a customs border in the Irish Sea. May described it as a threat to the constitutional integrity of the UK, but the new prime minister, Boris Johnson, has opened the current talks by proposing an all-Ireland agri-food zone. The suggestion is that he will seek to quietly build on that with further NI-only arrangements.</p>\n    <p>Given an NI-only backstop was an EU proposal in the first place, the U-turn would be warmly welcomed in Brussels, although attempts to give the Northern Ireland assembly a veto on its continuation would not be acceptable, and the DUP would be unlikely to support the prime minister in such a move in parliament.</p>\n    <p>If there is a no-deal Brexit, then there is no backstop.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/daniel-boffey\"><b>Daniel Boffey</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Indeed, Johnson has suggested that the single regulatory zone for agricultural goods should be permanent, citing Ian Paisley\u2019s refrain that the people of Northern Ireland may be British but its cattle are Irish.

The French parliament is to debate proposals for a three-year trial during which the tax office\u2019s computer system would collect information on peoples\u2019 lifestyles from social media accounts such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, and also monitor their activity on sites such as eBay and the French site Le Bon Coin. The idea, first suggested by the public action and accounts minister, G\u00e9rald Darmanin, is aimed at identifying gaps between a person\u2019s declared revenue and their lifestyle, as evidenced on their social media accounts. Darmanin told French TV last year that the tax office \u201cwill be able to see that if you have numerous pictures of yourself with a luxury car while you don\u2019t have the means to own one, then maybe your cousin or your girlfriend has lent it to you, or maybe not\u201d. It could also potentially detect customs fraud on online sales sites. The system would also be able to check where a person is mainly residing, for example if they have declared themselves domiciled abroad but are spending most of their time in France. The data watchdog la Commission Nationale de l\u2019Informatique et des Libert\u00e9s (CNIL) has given written advice that the government must show \u201ca great deal of prudence\u201d over the plan, which raised \u201cunprecedented questions over personal data protection\u201d. It said the plans could amount to the mass collection of data on a \u201csignificant scale\u201d, with information being automatically mined rather than gathered for specific, suspicious cases. The watchdog said such a massive collection of data could \u201csignificantly change individuals\u2019 behaviour online, where they might not feel able to express themselves freely on the platforms in question\u201d. The French government has suggested the trial would only run for three years. \u2022 This article was amended on 2 October 2019 to remove an incorrect reference to HMRC\u2019s computer system.",

      "body": "<p>The first time I meet Hammed Animashaun, Britain is wilting in a heatwave and he is dressed accordingly. He bowls into the bar at the Bridge theatre in London, standing 6ft 3in in a green basketball vest, black shorts, a bandana, assorted beads, rings and necklaces, and white trainers brighter than the afternoon sun. At this point, the genial 28-year-old is midway through the run of Nicholas Hytner\u2019s blissful production of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jun/11/a-midsummer-nights-dream-review-bridge-theatre-london-gwendoline-christie-nicholas-hytner\">A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream</a>, in which he is a joyful Bottom. A friend texted him all the wonderful things people have been saying \u2013 Time Out named him \u201cman of the match\u201d, the Standard \u201ca master of big-hearted comic nonsense\u201d, the Observer \u201cshow-stealing\u201d \u2013 but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to look. \u201cI had to delete the chat,\u201d he says, sipping a Diet Coke.</p> <p>In Hytner\u2019s gender-swapping spin, it is Titania who puts a love spell on Oberon, rather than the other way round, so it is Oberon who falls for Bottom. In yellow boiler suit and pert donkey ears, Animashaun laps up the affection, taking it merrily in his stride. \u201cThere\u2019s no spell on Bottom. He could just turn around and go, \u2018No thanks\u2019, but he doesn\u2019t. Do we have to explain that? I don\u2019t think so.

Such gleeful exhibitionism, it should be said, is par for the course for an actor who wore a Lady Gaga-style meat dress as one of the Ugly Sisters in Cinderella at the Lyric Hammersmith, rocked a pink leopard-print pantsuit and ginger beehive in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/dec/06/the-producers-review-mel-brooks-royal-exchange-manchester-raz-shaw\">The Producers at the Manchester Royal Exchange</a> and twerked naked on screen in the debauched British comedy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/14/the-festival-review-joe-thomas-iain-morris-inbetweeners\">The Festival</a>.</p> <p>Hytner emails later to enthuse about Animashaun. \u201cHe has what all the best Shakespeareans have: the ability to make it sound like he just thought of it. Here\u2019s at least one thing he did that hadn\u2019t occurred to me until he did it: he played the morning-after scene like he was kind of over Oberon. That he loved all the treats, the honey, the massage, the champagne, the clothes, but it wasn\u2019t ever going to be much more than a one-night stand and that the other guy was starting to be clingy. Which I thought was hilarious, truthful and rather sad, at least for Oberon.\u201d</p> <p>Animashaun tells me his performance is getting bigger all the time. \u201cI\u2019m still waiting for Nick to tell me to rein it in,\u201d he laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s like a party every night. If we didn\u2019t have to finish, I could go on doing this for ever. One hundred per cent.\u201d</p> <p>When we meet again six weeks later backstage at the National Theatre, he cuts a very different figure. He is now deep into rehearsals for <a href=\"https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/master-harold-and-the-boys?queueittoken=e_priority26sep19~q_00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000~ts_1569578601~ce_true~rt_afterevent~h_86d346ef74fb3cc2627ff7ded99838edbfa89b22f734ebc6b1f002be21ab5c93\">\u201cMaster Harold\u201d \u2026 and the Boys</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/athol-fugard\">Athol Fugard</a>\u2019s drama set in 1950s South Africa, in which he and Lucian Msamati play Willie and Sam, two servants whiling away an afternoon by practising ballroom dancing and shooting the breeze with Hally (Anson Boon), the teenage son of their white employers.</p> <p>Picking over a sandwich in his lunch break, Animashaun is relieved to have finally hung up his donkey ears for good and looks aghast when I remind him of his earlier enthusiasm for a bottomless Bottom, a never-ending Dream. \u201cThat was when I still had, like, a soul,\u201d he says, shaking his head. \u201cI\u2019m exhausted.

He doesn\u2019t say an awful lot but he communicates so much in the choices he makes physically. The way he treats Hally with respect compared to how he treats women. He doesn\u2019t see the problem \u2013 when women mess up, you beat them, right? It\u2019s a lot easier in his society to attack a black woman than to attack a white man. It\u2019s the food chain: he chooses the weaker animal.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I grew up in an area where you saw different sorts of people \u2026 I never had any racism directed at me until I was older</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Animashaun remembers going to the library in Tower Hamlets, London, as a child to read up on apartheid. \u201cI was so shocked. I grew up in an area where all you saw was different sorts of people, and that was amazing. I never had any racism directed at me until I was older, but, even at that young age, I knew it wasn\u2019t right.\u201d</p> <p>I ask where the racism came from. \u201cIt\u2019s happened a few times in the industry in quite subtle ways. You hear stories or someone will say directly, \u2018The only reason you got this job is cos you\u2019re black.\u2019 And then you go, \u2018Wait.

      "bodyText": "The first time I meet Hammed Animashaun, Britain is wilting in a heatwave and he is dressed accordingly. He bowls into the bar at the Bridge theatre in London, standing 6ft 3in in a green basketball vest, black shorts, a bandana, assorted beads, rings and necklaces, and white trainers brighter than the afternoon sun. At this point, the genial 28-year-old is midway through the run of Nicholas Hytner\u2019s blissful production of A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream, in which he is a joyful Bottom. A friend texted him all the wonderful things people have been saying \u2013 Time Out named him \u201cman of the match\u201d, the Standard \u201ca master of big-hearted comic nonsense\u201d, the Observer \u201cshow-stealing\u201d \u2013 but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to look. \u201cI had to delete the chat,\u201d he says, sipping a Diet Coke. In Hytner\u2019s gender-swapping spin, it is Titania who puts a love spell on Oberon, rather than the other way round, so it is Oberon who falls for Bottom. In yellow boiler suit and pert donkey ears, Animashaun laps up the affection, taking it merrily in his stride. \u201cThere\u2019s no spell on Bottom. He could just turn around and go, \u2018No thanks\u2019, but he doesn\u2019t. Do we have to explain that? I don\u2019t think so. Love is love.\u201d Most of the show\u2019s riotous highlights are his: demanding a mobile phone from the audience before snapping a group selfie of him and his am-dram troupe, or dancing and cavorting with Oberon while their bed is pushed through the crowd. \u201cI love looking out and seeing all those jaws on the floor,\u201d he says. Such gleeful exhibitionism, it should be said, is par for the course for an actor who wore a Lady Gaga-style meat dress as one of the Ugly Sisters in Cinderella at the Lyric Hammersmith, rocked a pink leopard-print pantsuit and ginger beehive in The Producers at the Manchester Royal Exchange and twerked naked on screen in the debauched British comedy The Festival. Hytner emails later to enthuse about Animashaun. \u201cHe has what all the best Shakespeareans have: the ability to make it sound like he just thought of it. Here\u2019s at least one thing he did that hadn\u2019t occurred to me until he did it: he played the morning-after scene like he was kind of over Oberon. That he loved all the treats, the honey, the massage, the champagne, the clothes, but it wasn\u2019t ever going to be much more than a one-night stand and that the other guy was starting to be clingy. Which I thought was hilarious, truthful and rather sad, at least for Oberon.\u201d Animashaun tells me his performance is getting bigger all the time. \u201cI\u2019m still waiting for Nick to tell me to rein it in,\u201d he laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s like a party every night. If we didn\u2019t have to finish, I could go on doing this for ever. One hundred per cent.\u201d When we meet again six weeks later backstage at the National Theatre, he cuts a very different figure. He is now deep into rehearsals for \u201cMaster Harold\u201d \u2026 and the Boys, Athol Fugard\u2019s drama set in 1950s South Africa, in which he and Lucian Msamati play Willie and Sam, two servants whiling away an afternoon by practising ballroom dancing and shooting the breeze with Hally (Anson Boon), the teenage son of their white employers. Picking over a sandwich in his lunch break, Animashaun is relieved to have finally hung up his donkey ears for good and looks aghast when I remind him of his earlier enthusiasm for a bottomless Bottom, a never-ending Dream. \u201cThat was when I still had, like, a soul,\u201d he says, shaking his head. \u201cI\u2019m exhausted. I\u2019m done.\u201d Though \u201cMaster Harold\u201d \u2026 and the Boys makes further demands on his dancing skills (\u201cMy calves are killing me\u201d), it represents a change of tempo, swapping the party atmosphere of Shakespeare\u2019s comedy for the simmering tensions of this politically charged three-hander. \u201cWillie is extremely flawed and that\u2019s where the challenges are coming from. He doesn\u2019t say an awful lot but he communicates so much in the choices he makes physically. The way he treats Hally with respect compared to how he treats women. He doesn\u2019t see the problem \u2013 when women mess up, you beat them, right? It\u2019s a lot easier in his society to attack a black woman than to attack a white man. It\u2019s the food chain: he chooses the weaker animal.\u201d Animashaun remembers going to the library in Tower Hamlets, London, as a child to read up on apartheid. \u201cI was so shocked. I grew up in an area where all you saw was different sorts of people, and that was amazing. I never had any racism directed at me until I was older, but, even at that young age, I knew it wasn\u2019t right.\u201d I ask where the racism came from. \u201cIt\u2019s happened a few times in the industry in quite subtle ways. You hear stories or someone will say directly, \u2018The only reason you got this job is cos you\u2019re black.\u2019 And then you go, \u2018Wait. That\u2019s racist.\u2019\u201d He has also experienced hostility outside work. \u201cYou get people hurling things, screaming things. That was a long time ago. But look at today\u2019s world. I was on a train and this guy was sitting beside me watching a Tommy Robinson video. That\u2019s how open everyone is about it right now.\u201d He scans the walls, momentarily lost for words. \u201cWhat could I say to him? I wouldn\u2019t know where to start.\u201d He\u2019s in no doubt about where the rise in intolerance has come from. \u201cIt\u2019s the leaders. One hundred per cent.

      "body": "<p>On 22 October, it will be 100 years since the birth of Doris Lessing. That\u2019s a good reason to revisit the work of the award winning British-Zimbabwean novelist here on the Reading group. In a career spanning more than 50 years, Lessing wrote dozens of works of fiction and biography, in many different genres and moods, and was shortlisted for \u2013 and won \u2013 most of the major literary awards in Europe. She won the Nobel prize in literature in 2007, when the Swedish Academy described her as \u201cthat epicist of the female experience, who with scepticism, fire and visionary power has subjected a divided civilisation to scrutiny\u201d. The word \u201cepicist\u201d means \u201cepic poet\u201d, which possibly fits Lessing in the broader sense of the term, even if <a href=\"http://booksbywomen.org/doris-lessing-little-known-poetry/\">the poetry she wrote </a><a href=\"http://booksbywomen.org/doris-lessing-little-known-poetry/\">had a quieter </a><a href=\"http://booksbywomen.org/doris-lessing-little-known-poetry/\">impact than her novels</a>.</p> <p>At 88, Lessing was the oldest author to receive the honour. She was also <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuBODHFBZ8k\">one of the most non</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuBODHFBZ8k\">plussed</a>. \u201cOh Christ,\u201d she said when a reporter on her doorstep told her she\u2019d won. On further reflection she said: \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019d like some uplifting remarks of some kind \u2026 It\u2019s been going on now for 30 years, one can get more excited \u2026 I\u2019ve won all the prizes in Europe \u2013 every bloody one. I\u2019m delighted to have won them all. The whole lot.\u201d</p> <p>In 2007, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/oct/14/nobelprize.awardsandprizes\">Robert McCrum saluted her in the Observer</a> as a writer \u201cwho has dedicated her long life and impressive body of work to the tireless and unflinching exploration of man\u2019s (and woman\u2019s) place in the world, together with issues of race, gender and social justice. This prize finally acknowledges what has been true for at least 40 years: that she is one of the most important literary voices of her generation.\u201d</p> <p>McCrum noted that her work was mainly read by people over the age of 35. Presumably, those readers are now over 47. It\u2019s hard to tell how many younger readers have been picking her up since. I myself read The Grass Is Singing, first published in 1950, around the time of the Nobel announcement and promised to read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2007/nov/09/anobellaureateinthemaking\">\u201cmore Lessing\u201d</a>. It\u2019s not just the appalling joke that makes me redden but that I haven\u2019t read any of her books since. This is a good chance, for me anyway, to put that right and celebrate this astonishing writer.</p> <p>The only question is which book to read. Her work includes furious takedowns of colonialism and apartheid, explorations of female inner space such as in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/06/100-best-novels-golden-notebook-doris-lessing\">The Golden Notebook</a> and outer space in books like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2013/nov/27/doris-lessing-realism-science-fiction\">Canopus in Argos</a>. Lessing poured scorn on the idea that she could be pigeonholed. She had been given \u201cevery conceivable label. I started off as a writer about the colour bar, and then I was a communist, then a feminist, then a mystic.\u2019 And now? What I always was. Just the same.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/2007/lessing/bibliography/\">Her </a><a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/2007/lessing/bibliography/\">extensive bibliography</a> may be one reason why her work so impressed the Nobel committee. Let\u2019s take a vote and choose the book that is most often nominated in the comments below as this month\u2019s Reading group choice. First a caution: an impressive number of those books remain in print, but not all of them. If you do want to choose one of the less famous novels, make sure it is widely available so as many people as possible can take part. As always, all other ideas and points for discussion are welcome.</p>",

On further reflection she said: \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019d like some uplifting remarks of some kind \u2026 It\u2019s been going on now for 30 years, one can get more excited \u2026 I\u2019ve won all the prizes in Europe \u2013 every bloody one. I\u2019m delighted to have won them all. The whole lot.\u201d In 2007, Robert McCrum saluted her in the Observer as a writer \u201cwho has dedicated her long life and impressive body of work to the tireless and unflinching exploration of man\u2019s (and woman\u2019s) place in the world, together with issues of race, gender and social justice. This prize finally acknowledges what has been true for at least 40 years: that she is one of the most important literary voices of her generation.\u201d McCrum noted that her work was mainly read by people over the age of 35. Presumably, those readers are now over 47. It\u2019s hard to tell how many younger readers have been picking her up since. I myself read The Grass Is Singing, first published in 1950, around the time of the Nobel announcement and promised to read \u201cmore Lessing\u201d. It\u2019s not just the appalling joke that makes me redden but that I haven\u2019t read any of her books since. This is a good chance, for me anyway, to put that right and celebrate this astonishing writer. The only question is which book to read. Her work includes furious takedowns of colonialism and apartheid, explorations of female inner space such as in The Golden Notebook and outer space in books like Canopus in Argos. Lessing poured scorn on the idea that she could be pigeonholed. She had been given \u201cevery conceivable label. I started off as a writer about the colour bar, and then I was a communist, then a feminist, then a mystic.\u2019 And now? What I always was. Just the same.\u201d Her extensive bibliography may be one reason why her work so impressed the Nobel committee. Let\u2019s take a vote and choose the book that is most often nominated in the comments below as this month\u2019s Reading group choice. First a caution: an impressive number of those books remain in print, but not all of them. If you do want to choose one of the less famous novels, make sure it is widely available so as many people as possible can take part. As always, all other ideas and points for discussion are welcome.",

The hooker, who has captained Argentina 49 times, spent two seasons in the Premiership with Worcester and he believes that gives him inside knowledge on the Pumas\u2019 opponents this weekend. \u201cI think sometimes [their structure] is boring but it\u2019s good for England, and it works,\u201d Creevy said. \u201cI spent a lot of time there and it was great. I improved a lot in the way I see rugby, and I understand a lot about how the England boys see rugby. They are really structured. \u201cMaybe my play in Worcester helped [me] to see the way it will come on Saturday. They always play the same way in history. They are really structured and that for me is really good. I improved a lot.\u201d Creevy relinquished the Argentina captaincy after four years in 2018 but he remains one of the most feared hookers in world rugby. He has faced England five times and lost on each occasion \u2013 the Pumas have not won in their past nine meetings since their 2009 victory \u2013 but he is relishing the challenge that awaits. \u201cSaturday is going to be like a war, it\u2019s like a final for us,\u201d said Creevy, who arrived at Worcester in 2013. \u201cI think the battle with the forwards will be the game. We need to win the scrum, win the lineout, win the maul, win the contact, the breakdown. \u201cWhen we put on this shirt we feel something different. It\u2019s our country, our family, my club. We play together, the group is really bonded. That is different to different teams. We love each other, and I think that is different to other teams. We are friends, we are brothers, inside and outside the field.\u201d Argentina are traditionally known for a strong set piece being the bedrock of their game.

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated.

      "bodyText": "British manufacturers have ramped up their stockpiling efforts ahead of the new Brexit deadline at the end of the month, amid growing concerns over disruption to the UK economy. According to IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (Cips), UK factory output was boosted in September by firms rushing to purchase goods and materials to avoid any potential border delays. Despite the increase in stockpiling activity after a lull in activity over the summer, the survey showed that factory output fell for the fifth-month in a row, the longest downturn since the last recession in 2009. The new rush to build up supplies ahead of Brexit helped to lift the IHS Markit/Cips manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) to 48.3 in September from a six-and-a-half-year low of 47.4 in August. However, it remains below the 50.0 mark that separates growth from contraction. Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, said: \u201cThe impact of such Brexit-related stock building was dwarfed by weakening demand for other customers, due in part to clients routing supply chains away from the UK.\u201d Manufacturing output across the developed the world has slumped in recent months amid the continuing US-China trade war, which has sapped business investment and depressed export demand. Manufacturing output in the eurozone has dropped to the lowest levels in seven years, dragging major countries such as Italy and Germany to the brink of recession. In a sign of the continuing downturn in UK manufacturing, firms said that output, new orders, and export business all fell in September. Employment levels also fell at the fastest pace in six years, with around 8,000 jobs lost in September, up from around 6,000 in August. Against a backdrop of mounting political turmoil in recent months, UK firms have begun redoubling their efforts to prepare for a potentially damaging no-deal Brexit at the end of October. Greggs, the high street bakery chain, said on Tuesday it is taking steps to build up stocks of key ingredients and equipment that could be affected. It has rented warehouse space and will begin stockpiling some longer-life products sourced from Europe, such as bacon and tuna. It has also begun sourcing all its cheese and most of its sugar in the UK to avoid potential disruption. Greggs chief executive, Roger Whiteside, said the company would not be able to replace delicate foodstuffs such as tomatoes and lettuce and would have to switch to alternatives or stop selling products which used items held up by problems at ports. Some firms have also started stockpiling beer, wine and spirits to keep the alcohol flowing at Christmas. Analysts have warned that the Brexit deadline comes as warehousing activity ramps up ahead of the festive season, making planning for both events harder for businesses. Firms across the UK had rushed to stockpile before the original Brexit deadline on 29 March, providing a boost to economic growth earlier this year. Companies then opted to run down supplies after Theresa May delayed the deadline until the end of October, dragging down economic output, taking Britain to the brink of recession. James Smith, an economist at the Dutch bank ING, said the boost was unlikely to be as significant the second time around, adding: \u201cInventory levels are still perceived to be fairly high, but also warehousing space is becoming more constrained given the close proximity to Black Friday and Christmas.\u201d",

For this reason, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/natgeo/\">Prince Harry\u2019s takeover of the National Geographic Instagram</a> account to encourage people to \u201clook up\u201d and get lost in the beauty of trees is a weirdly enticing concept.</p> <p>On Monday, the Duke of Sussex curated a set of images of forest canopies each taken by National Geographic photographers, which went out to the publication\u2019s 123 million followers. The idea was to highlight the importance of conservation while spotlighting the Queen\u2019s Commonwealth Canopy campaign, which will result in two national parks being created in South Africa, where Harry is touring. As part of the campaign, 50 countries have either dedicated indigenous forest for conservation or committed to planting millions of new trees to combat climate change.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B3CNOrBDYQU/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

I\u2019m so happy to have the opportunity to continue working with @NatGeo and to guest-curate this Instagram account; it\u2019s one of my personal favourites. Today I\u2019m in Liwonde National Park, Malawi an important stop on our official tour of southern Africa, planting trees for the Queens Commonwealth Canopy. As part of this takeover, I am inviting you to be a part of our \u2018Looking Up\u2019 social campaign. To help launch the campaign, here is a photograph I took today here in Liwonde of Baobab trees. \u201c#LookingUp seeks to raise awareness of the vital role trees play in the Earth\u2019s ecosystem, and is an opportunity for all of us to take a moment, to appreciate the beauty of our surroundings. So, join us today and share your own view, by looking up! Post images of the trees in your local community using the hashtag #LookingUp. I will be posting my favourite images from @NatGeo photographers here throughout the day, and over on @sussexroyal I will be sharing some of my favourite images from everything you post. I can\u2019t wait to see what you see when you\u2019re #LookingUp \ud83c\udf32 \ud83c\udf33\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 His Royal Highness is currently on an official tour to further the Queens Commonwealth Canopy, which was launched in 2015. Commonwealth countries have been invited to submit forests and national parks to be protected and preserved as well as to plant trees. The Duke has helped QCC projects in the Caribbean, U.K., New Zealand, Australia, Botswana, Malawi, and Tonga. Now, almost 50 countries are taking part and have dedicated indigenous forests for conservation and committed to planting millions of new trees to help combat climate change. The Duke\u2019s longtime passion for trees and forests as nature\u2019s simple solution to the environmental issues we face has been inspired by the work he has been doing on behalf of his grandmother, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, for many years.</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/natgeo/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> National Geographic</a> (@natgeo) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2019-09-30T11:57:00+00:00\">Sep 30, 2019 at 4:57am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> </figure>  <p>One image shows Harry flat on his backside, taking a photo of an imposing South African baobab tree, which can live for more than 1,000 years and, due to its size, even sustain its own ecosystem. The Duke has captured its spindly branches with a finesse rewarded by 412,000 likes. </p> <p>The other photographs, which include a red-leafed autumnal British tree and the distinctive strangler fig, with its branches knotted together like a spider\u2019s web, are strikingly beautiful. It is a shame, though, that the accompanying captions \u2013 in which Harry describes how the strangler fig\u2019s twisty barks helped it earn its name or why the red leaves of autumn in the UK are special \u2013 are so alarmingly redolent of a basic Wikipedia search.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B3C1gnvlEq9/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Thanks to Simon Roberts for sharing this. It was taken at the National Arboretum, which makes it even more special.\u201d \u2014Prince Harry, The Duke of Sussex @sussexroyal Selected by The Duke for the #LookingUp campaign with @natgeo, Simon\u2019s image was taken at the National Arboretum, in Gloucestershire, England, which is a year-round centre of remembrance for those who have served their country.  Please keep sharing your own #LookingUp images from your own community, and at the end of the day The Duke will be sharing some of his favourites on @sussexroyal Instagram stories. ... Today, The Duke of Sussex @sussexroyal is guest-editing the @natgeo feed, in an effort to raise awareness around Queens Commonwealth Canopy, in which almost 50 countries have dedicated indigenous forest for conservation or have committed to planting millions of new trees to combat climate change.  The images being posted today are all \u2018looking up\u2019 at trees from below to highlight the vital role trees play in the Earth\u2019s ecosystem. Post your images of trees, add #lookingup, and at the end of the day, The Duke will share a selection of images that you post from across the world on @sussexroyal Instagram stories</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/natgeo/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> National Geographic</a> (@natgeo) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2019-09-30T17:48:59+00:00\">Sep 30, 2019 at 10:48am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> </figure>  <p>A few more details on why these trees are so ecologically important might have been a good idea. Fortunately, the National Geographic\u2019s enthusiastic readers don\u2019t seem to mind: one of the top-rated comments is from rappers Cypress Hill, whose use of the tree emoji may allude to sparking up debate about a very different kind of plant.</p> <p>Thanks to its snappy hashtag (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/lookingup/\">#LookingUp</a>) and hundreds of thousands of likes, the campaign will at least encourage Instagram users to find out more about the potential of planting trees. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/04/planting-billions-trees-best-tackle-climate-crisis-scientists-canopy-emissions\">New research predicts</a> that a worldwide planting programme could have a \u201cmind-blowing\u201d effect by removing as many as two-thirds of all the emissions that humans currently pump into the atmosphere. It argues that with 1.7bn hectares of treeless land available, which is roughly the same size as the US and China combined, around 1.2tn native tree saplings could be naturally grown. Suddenly, Harry liking trees seems kind of cool.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B3CjdQjDLiH/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

      "bodyText": "When celebrities become guest editors of corporate social media accounts, it usually results in dozens of pouting selfies. For this reason, Prince Harry\u2019s takeover of the National Geographic Instagram account to encourage people to \u201clook up\u201d and get lost in the beauty of trees is a weirdly enticing concept. On Monday, the Duke of Sussex curated a set of images of forest canopies each taken by National Geographic photographers, which went out to the publication\u2019s 123 million followers. The idea was to highlight the importance of conservation while spotlighting the Queen\u2019s Commonwealth Canopy campaign, which will result in two national parks being created in South Africa, where Harry is touring. As part of the campaign, 50 countries have either dedicated indigenous forest for conservation or committed to planting millions of new trees to combat climate change. One image shows Harry flat on his backside, taking a photo of an imposing South African baobab tree, which can live for more than 1,000 years and, due to its size, even sustain its own ecosystem. The Duke has captured its spindly branches with a finesse rewarded by 412,000 likes. The other photographs, which include a red-leafed autumnal British tree and the distinctive strangler fig, with its branches knotted together like a spider\u2019s web, are strikingly beautiful. It is a shame, though, that the accompanying captions \u2013 in which Harry describes how the strangler fig\u2019s twisty barks helped it earn its name or why the red leaves of autumn in the UK are special \u2013 are so alarmingly redolent of a basic Wikipedia search. A few more details on why these trees are so ecologically important might have been a good idea. Fortunately, the National Geographic\u2019s enthusiastic readers don\u2019t seem to mind: one of the top-rated comments is from rappers Cypress Hill, whose use of the tree emoji may allude to sparking up debate about a very different kind of plant. Thanks to its snappy hashtag (#LookingUp) and hundreds of thousands of likes, the campaign will at least encourage Instagram users to find out more about the potential of planting trees. New research predicts that a worldwide planting programme could have a \u201cmind-blowing\u201d effect by removing as many as two-thirds of all the emissions that humans currently pump into the atmosphere. It argues that with 1.7bn hectares of treeless land available, which is roughly the same size as the US and China combined, around 1.2tn native tree saplings could be naturally grown. Suddenly, Harry liking trees seems kind of cool. Critics will surely point to the hypocrisy of Harry fronting an eco-friendly campaign while riding around in a private jet. Nonetheless, in encouraging the public to regard trees as holy beings, rather than disposable wood, his takeover of the National Geographic\u2019s Instagram spotlights the important role these natural giants can play in preserving the future of our planet. Prince Charles, infamously once revealed how he likes to talk to his plants, but Harry\u2019s fascination with trees appears less like a midlife crisis and more like a savvy social media-friendly way to address global warming. After weeks of unflattering headlines about his and Meghan\u2019s travelling habits, Harry\u2019s tree-hugging won\u2019t do much to get them back on side, but in terms of positioning the Duke of Sussex as, well, the Green Prince, it looks like mission accomplished.",

The company plans to increase the size of the workforce by several hundred over the next five years, it said in a statement to the Aim junior stock market. \u201cHarland and Wolff is a landmark asset and its reputation as one of the finest multipurpose fabrication facilities in Europe is testament to its highly skilled team in Belfast,\u201d said Wood. The InfraStrata boss said he had worked as an engineering officer on board the Canberra, a ship built by Harland and Wolff. \u201cI know how well built the ship was, which is testament to the quality of work here in Belfast,\u201d he said. Wood added that the company hopes to rehire some of the staff who took voluntary redundancy when Harland and Wolff went into administration, as well as staff who lost their jobs in the collapse of nearby Wrightbus. While the yard will initially make pipework and steel modules for the Islandmagee gas storage plant, which involves compressing gas for storage 1,500m below the sea floor in salt beds, Wood said it could also return to shipbuilding.",

Meanwhile an eight-part extension of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/aug/25/sanditon-review-every-period-drama-box-ticked\">Sanditon</a>, on which Austen was forced to stop work in 1817 because of illness, occupies a prime-time Sunday night slot on ITV. Seeing the two works in conjunction tells us a lot about the challenges of adapting Austen and about the nature of stage and TV drama.</p> <p>Wade takes a bold approach to adapting Austen. She faithfully sets up the dilemma posed by what little we have of The Watsons: which of three potential suitors should the lively, witty but impoverished Emma Watson choose? A diffident aristo, a sententious parson or a suave bounder? Having established the situation, Wade then springs a surprise \u2013 and it is difficult not to give part of the game away \u2013 by introducing herself, as the adapter, into the action. What follows is a dazzling meditation on any number of topics: on Austen\u2019s own preferred outcome, on the afterlife of literary creations, on the inherent conflict between invented characters and the writer who brings them into existence.</p> <p>At what point, Wade asks, does a character acquire such independent vitality that it starts to dictate action? Does Austen write Elizabeth Bennet or does Elizabeth Bennet, to some extent, write Austen?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"839705506cd28fd6a20946d80711da5769bdc5d8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/839705506cd28fd6a20946d80711da5769bdc5d8/0_447_5460_3267/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beside the seaside \u2026 Rose Williams and Kate Ashfield in Sanditon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"598\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beside the seaside \u2026 Rose Williams and Kate Ashfield in Sanditon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Ridgway/Red Planet Pictures/ITV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.itv.com/hub/sanditon/2a6094\">Sanditon</a>, adapted by Andrew Davies and a team of writers, inevitably takes a different tack. For a start, the unfinished novel shows Austen, at the end of her life, opening up new territory. She was writing about the early 19th-century vogue for seaside resorts and the commercial hazards, burgeoning possibilities and social mobility this involved. TV seizes on this to show Sanditon being built and to follow the fortunes of the speculating Tom Parker, the disdainful Lady Denham (a wonderful Anne Reid) and the highly practical Charlotte Heywood.</p> <p>Ideas are niftily pinched from other Austen novels as a way of developing plot. We\u2019re told of the young Catherine Morland in Northanger Abbey that she \u201cgreatly preferred cricket not merely to dolls\u201d but to all other childish amusements. So one episode of Sanditon was almost entirely taken up by a cricket match in which Charlotte rescued the toffs\u2019 team from humiliating defeat by a gang of resentfully unpaid workers.</p> <p>Sanditon makes an entertaining addition to the Austen canon even if the hint of oral sex in the first episode might have had dedicated Janeites reaching for the smelling salts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f16b7dbf19bef02833b425d6b7750db2c5f2ee8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f16b7dbf19bef02833b425d6b7750db2c5f2ee8/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Intervention \u2026 the playwright (portrayed here by Louise Ford, right) injects herself \u2013 and her 21st-century mindset \u2013 into The Watsons.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Intervention \u2026 the playwright (portrayed here by Louise Ford, right) injects herself \u2013 and her 21st-century mindset \u2013 into The Watsons.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manuel Harlan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While Sanditon is bound by the linear conventions of TV classic drama, Wade\u2019s version of The Watsons plays with dramatic form, poses a whole series of questions about the nature of drama and fiction, and even makes glancing topical points: \u201cWe don\u2019t need experts,\u201d Emma cries at one point, \u201cwe have hearts, we have minds!\u201d Television can do all manner of things that the stage can\u2019t. But, for all its merits, Sanditon basically offers a decorative speculation about what might have happened next in Austen\u2019s imagined resort.</p> <p>The Watsons, taking advantage of the theatre\u2019s capacity for risk, digs much deeper to question the very nature of adaptation and to ask who actually \u201cowns\u201d a fictional character. I accept that Sanditon is Sunday-night viewing and The Watsons is for a theatrical minority but when, if ever, will television show the same freedom to experiment?</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.cft.org.uk/whats-on/event/the-watsons\">The Watsons is at the Menier Chocolate Factory, London, </a>until 16 November.

Laura Wade\u2019s version of The Watsons, abandoned by Austen after the death of her father in 1805, has moved triumphantly from Chichester to London\u2019s Menier Chocolate Factory. Meanwhile an eight-part extension of Sanditon, on which Austen was forced to stop work in 1817 because of illness, occupies a prime-time Sunday night slot on ITV. Seeing the two works in conjunction tells us a lot about the challenges of adapting Austen and about the nature of stage and TV drama. Wade takes a bold approach to adapting Austen. She faithfully sets up the dilemma posed by what little we have of The Watsons: which of three potential suitors should the lively, witty but impoverished Emma Watson choose? A diffident aristo, a sententious parson or a suave bounder? Having established the situation, Wade then springs a surprise \u2013 and it is difficult not to give part of the game away \u2013 by introducing herself, as the adapter, into the action. What follows is a dazzling meditation on any number of topics: on Austen\u2019s own preferred outcome, on the afterlife of literary creations, on the inherent conflict between invented characters and the writer who brings them into existence. At what point, Wade asks, does a character acquire such independent vitality that it starts to dictate action? Does Austen write Elizabeth Bennet or does Elizabeth Bennet, to some extent, write Austen? Sanditon, adapted by Andrew Davies and a team of writers, inevitably takes a different tack. For a start, the unfinished novel shows Austen, at the end of her life, opening up new territory. She was writing about the early 19th-century vogue for seaside resorts and the commercial hazards, burgeoning possibilities and social mobility this involved. TV seizes on this to show Sanditon being built and to follow the fortunes of the speculating Tom Parker, the disdainful Lady Denham (a wonderful Anne Reid) and the highly practical Charlotte Heywood. Ideas are niftily pinched from other Austen novels as a way of developing plot. We\u2019re told of the young Catherine Morland in Northanger Abbey that she \u201cgreatly preferred cricket not merely to dolls\u201d but to all other childish amusements. So one episode of Sanditon was almost entirely taken up by a cricket match in which Charlotte rescued the toffs\u2019 team from humiliating defeat by a gang of resentfully unpaid workers. Sanditon makes an entertaining addition to the Austen canon even if the hint of oral sex in the first episode might have had dedicated Janeites reaching for the smelling salts. While Sanditon is bound by the linear conventions of TV classic drama, Wade\u2019s version of The Watsons plays with dramatic form, poses a whole series of questions about the nature of drama and fiction, and even makes glancing topical points: \u201cWe don\u2019t need experts,\u201d Emma cries at one point, \u201cwe have hearts, we have minds!\u201d Television can do all manner of things that the stage can\u2019t. But, for all its merits, Sanditon basically offers a decorative speculation about what might have happened next in Austen\u2019s imagined resort. The Watsons, taking advantage of the theatre\u2019s capacity for risk, digs much deeper to question the very nature of adaptation and to ask who actually \u201cowns\u201d a fictional character. I accept that Sanditon is Sunday-night viewing and The Watsons is for a theatrical minority but when, if ever, will television show the same freedom to experiment? \u2022 The Watsons is at the Menier Chocolate Factory, London, until 16 November. Sanditon is on ITV at 9pm on Sundays; catch up with past episodes on ITV Hub.",

And all that\u2019s before you even get into the tit-for-tat whatabout of what the guy on the other side got up to in the 52nd minute. The referees don\u2019t seem to agree with the judicial committees, who keep clashing with the coaches, whose players seem to be confused about what they are being told to do by World Rugby, whose instructions seem to be at odds with a lot of what the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/24/rugby-world-cup-referees-japan\" title=\"\">referees are doing</a> on the field.</p> \n<p>So we have seen tackles the referee and television match official didn\u2019t think were worth so much as a penalty, but which the disciplinary panel then decided deserved a three-week ban. Tackles that, one head coach was convinced, should have cost the opposition a penalty try, but which went entirely unpunished. Tackles where the referee and television match official agreed there were mitigating circumstances, but the disciplinary panel didn\u2019t, so the players who made them ended up being given the very same sentence as the guy whose appallingly cynical shoulder charge damn near decapitated the man at whom it was aimed.</p> \n<p>\u201cI am embarrassed here,\u201d said Australia\u2019s head coach, Michael Cheika. \u201cI do not understand any more.\u201d Well, Cheika tends to blow hard when he\u2019s hot. But it\u2019s not just him. After Samoa had two players suspended, their defence coach, Alistair Rogers, put in a special request to World Rugby\u2019s high-performance manager, Alain Rolland, for more clarity on exactly what his players were supposed to be doing in the tackle. This was just days after Rolland told us all he was confident that the teams all understood the details of the new high tackle framework because he and his deputies had personally briefed them on it all right before the tournament.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6fef03be-90e4-4479-a966-6b06ac24f770\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u2022&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/18/rugby-world-cup-2019-fixtures-tables-and-results\">Fixtures, tables and results</a></p>\n    <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/20/top-try-and-points-scorers-for-the-2019-rugby-world-cup-japan\">Top try and points scorers</a></p>\n    <p>\u2022&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/19/rugby-world-cup-2019-stadium-guide\">Stadium guide</a></p>\n    <p>\u2022&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/19/rugby-world-cup-2019-guide-to-the-referees\">Referee guide</a><br></p>\n    <p>\u2022 Our latest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/minutebyminute+sport/rugby-union\">minute-by-minute live reports</a></p>\n    <p>\u2022&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/18/sign-up-to-the-breakdown\">Sign up to The Breakdown</a>, our free rugby union email newsletter</p>\n    <p><b>Team guides</b><br>Pool A: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/09/rugby-world-cup-2019-ireland-team-guide\">Ireland</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/09/rugby-world-cup-2019-japan-team-guide\">Japan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/10/rugby-world-cup-2019-russia-team-guide\">Russia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/10/rugby-world-cup-2019-samoa-team-guide\">Samoa</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/11/rugby-world-cup-2019-scotland-team-guide\">Scotland</a><br>Pool B: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/11/rugby-world-cup-2019-canada-team-guide\">Canada</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/12/rugby-world-cup-2019-italy-team-guide\">Italy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/12/rugby-world-cup-2019-namibia-team-guide\">Namibia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/13/rugby-world-cup-2019-new-zealand-team-guide\">New Zealand</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/13/rugby-world-cup-2019-south-africa-team-guide\">South Africa</a><br>Pool C: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/14/rugby-world-cup-2019-argentina-team-guide\">Argentina</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/14/rugby-world-cup-2019-england-team-guide\">England</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/15/rugby-world-cup-2019-france-team-guide\">France</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/16/rugby-world-cup-2019-tonga-team-guide\">Tonga</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/15/rugby-world-cup-2019-usa-team-guide\">USA</a><br>Pool D: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/17/rugby-world-cup-2019-australia-team-guide\">Australia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/18/rugby-world-cup-2019-fiji-team-guide\">Fiji</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/17/rugby-world-cup-2019-georgia-team-guide\">Georgia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/18/rugby-world-cup-2019-uruguay-team-guide\">Uruguay</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/sep/16/rugby-world-cup-2019-wales-team-guide\">Wales</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The strange part is that reason they introduced this new framework was so that, as one of the men who designed it <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/bmjpodcasts/world-rugbys-concussion-journey-from-description-to-intervention-episode-394\" title=\"\">explained in a recent podcast</a>, everyone can look at the same tackle and see the same thing.

That\u2019s the subject of Elton\u2019s show: not only that \u201cI don\u2019t understand any more\u201d, but that today\u2019s world is so confusing, he now worries he never understood anything in the first place. What\u2019s refreshing is that Elton \u2013 rather than fleeing towards old certainties \u2013 embraces the confusion, at least in principle.</p> <p>There\u2019s a have-cake-and-eat-it dynamic at play, in that he repeatedly asserts his support of new developments in culture (particularly relating to gender and sexuality), while exploiting the humour of his predicament as a sexagenarian at sea in the modern world. He takes \u201cpale, male and stale\u201d on the chin, admitting this is \u201ca limp, wrinkly Caucasian scrotum of a show\u201d. His material on sexuality as a spectrum and trans awareness (\u201cI used to know I was a man\u201d) is disarmingly open-ended. So, too, a section on Germaine Greer\u2019s journey from feminist hero to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/25/germaine-greer-prejudice-trans-people\">feminist pariah</a>, the final line of which gets a laugh despite clearly not being meant as a joke.</p> <p>Does that mean Elton isn\u2019t in control of his material? Occasionally, perhaps \u2013 a section on his father\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s is awkwardly framed. But, more often, he treads deftly the delicate line between respect for a new generation\u2019s truths and vestigial loyalty to his own. And he repeatedly finds the funny while doing so, with his striking line about all men sharing Harvey Weinstein\u2019s bathrobe, a lurid future projection of his kids\u2019 generation conga-ing to Kanye in their care homes, or his vision of what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2007/aug/06/tomorrowsworldcouldinspire\">Tomorrow\u2019s World</a> might have looked like had Maggie Philbin really known what was in store for us.</p> <p>As he cartoon-stomps around the stage, the rhythms of 80s-era Elton are vividly summoned by, say, his early routine (\u201cI\u2019ve got the Alz\u201d) about his fear of looming senility. Yes, conservatism creeps in, particularly after the interval, as he laments the advent of the internet, sourdough bread and craft beer. It\u2019s usually self-aware and sometimes very droll, as when Elton protests at other people\u2019s fingers \u201cfossicking\u201d (lovely word) in the rock salt. But the contention that everything was better \u201cwhen I was a kid\u201d gets a little over-insistent.</p> <p>There\u2019s too much in the show \u2013 he\u2019s no sooner started on Orwellian workplace terminology than he\u2019s jumped those tracks to decry the Americanisation of the UK. Then \u2013 after he ardently debunks the myth that Boris Johnson is funny \u2013 the jokes fall away and Elton sounds a sonorous alarm at our looming \u201cnew dark age\u201d. At its best, this is a show that\u2019s intensely engaged with how we live now, from a comic who\u2019ll grant you pale and male while humbly contesting the sell-by date.</p> <p>\u2022 At <a href=\"https://www.paviliontheatre.co.uk/shows/ben-elton-live/\">Glasgow Pavilion</a>, 1 October; <a href=\"http://www.benelton.net/\">then touring</a> until 20 December. </p>",

His material on sexuality as a spectrum and trans awareness (\u201cI used to know I was a man\u201d) is disarmingly open-ended. So, too, a section on Germaine Greer\u2019s journey from feminist hero to feminist pariah, the final line of which gets a laugh despite clearly not being meant as a joke. Does that mean Elton isn\u2019t in control of his material? Occasionally, perhaps \u2013 a section on his father\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s is awkwardly framed. But, more often, he treads deftly the delicate line between respect for a new generation\u2019s truths and vestigial loyalty to his own. And he repeatedly finds the funny while doing so, with his striking line about all men sharing Harvey Weinstein\u2019s bathrobe, a lurid future projection of his kids\u2019 generation conga-ing to Kanye in their care homes, or his vision of what Tomorrow\u2019s World might have looked like had Maggie Philbin really known what was in store for us. As he cartoon-stomps around the stage, the rhythms of 80s-era Elton are vividly summoned by, say, his early routine (\u201cI\u2019ve got the Alz\u201d) about his fear of looming senility. Yes, conservatism creeps in, particularly after the interval, as he laments the advent of the internet, sourdough bread and craft beer. It\u2019s usually self-aware and sometimes very droll, as when Elton protests at other people\u2019s fingers \u201cfossicking\u201d (lovely word) in the rock salt. But the contention that everything was better \u201cwhen I was a kid\u201d gets a little over-insistent. There\u2019s too much in the show \u2013 he\u2019s no sooner started on Orwellian workplace terminology than he\u2019s jumped those tracks to decry the Americanisation of the UK. Then \u2013 after he ardently debunks the myth that Boris Johnson is funny \u2013 the jokes fall away and Elton sounds a sonorous alarm at our looming \u201cnew dark age\u201d. At its best, this is a show that\u2019s intensely engaged with how we live now, from a comic who\u2019ll grant you pale and male while humbly contesting the sell-by date. \u2022 At Glasgow Pavilion, 1 October; then touring until 20 December.",

The holders have fielded a strong side despite the outcome being as close to a foregone conclusion as is possible in a two-horse race, led by Kieran Read and boasting Richie Mo\u2019unga and Beauden Barrett behind as the All Blacks look to build on their opening-round victory over South Africa, which all but guaranteed they would top the pool. \u201cThey are clearly skilled, but I have seen some of these guys run fitness tests so I know their fitness isn\u2019t necessarily going to be much better than ours,\u201d said the Canada second row Evan Olmstead. \u201cI\u2019ve seen them make mistakes and I have seen them do great things so it will be a special occasion for us. \u201cJapan\u2019s victory over Ireland gives a lot of guys confidence. We were on the bus back from training when the game was being played and we were streaming it on our phones. I never doubt myself. I always go on the field wanting to win and do not accept anything less. Seeing teams that are not rated as highly beat the big guys gives me belief.\u201d Canada will need belief and more. They have played New Zealand five times in full internationals and the average score is 61-11 against them. \u201cWe understand what we are facing,\u201d said the Canada head coach, Kingsley Jones, \u201cbut we look forward to it with excitement. We want to come out of the match with respect, which means sticking to the task and putting in a performance for 80 minutes.\u201d The New Zealand flanker Ardie Savea will be making World Cup history by playing in World Rugby-approved goggles \u2013 as previously worn elsewhere by the likes of Ian McKinley \u2013 after having problems with the sight in one eye. \u201cIt is purely for protection,\u201d said the New Zealand attack coach, Ian Foster. \u201cWhen a player says that the problem in his eye is getting worse, you have to do something. He has been dealing with it for a few years and our medical team came up with this idea.\u201d Canada are 22nd in the rankings, a fraction above Namibia, New Zealand\u2019s opponents on Sunday. The All Blacks final group match is against Italy, a side they have scored 176 points against in their last three trips to Rome.

      "bodyText": "Blowing on horns, waving black flags and playing blaring sirens and loud music through a speaker system, protesters outside a WeWork branch in Shoreditch, London, demanded the attention of those going in and out last week. The deafening demonstration \u2013 which called for four cleaners who have lost their jobs at WeWork to be reinstated \u2013 made for a stark contrast with the cool, modern environment inside, with its standup-friendly furniture, \u201cwritable\u201d walls and endless stream of freshly roasted coffee. The protest highlighted a problem that has become widespread: many modern multinationals in cities across the globe are now staffed by what amounts to a two-tier workforce. Employees enjoy protected employment advantages, while the outsourced people who keep the workspaces running \u2013 who clean them and keep them safe \u2013 often have more precarious roles with inferior terms and conditions. The office rental company WeWork has grown into an empire, developing a reputation for trendy workspaces where entrepreneurs and firms can collaborate over craft beers or coffee in light airy lounges. It operates offices in around 100 cities and has around 527,000 members and 528 locations. (Guardian US leases space from WeWork.) In recent weeks, however, its parent company has been beset with problems, scrapping plans for a $20bn IPO, and WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann announced he was stepping down as chief executive. The brand sets great store by the concept of community, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily include the cleaners, who, at least in the UK, are all outsourced workers. The dispute in London centres on four cleaners who were employed by CCM Facilities, which provides cleaning services at WeWork\u2019s London offices. (There was a fifth dismissed cleaner involved, but he appears to have been rehired by CCM.) The protest \u2013 as with one a week earlier at No 1 Poultry near Bank \u2013 was organised by the Cleaners and Allied Independent Workers Union (CAIWU), which represents more than 1,000 workers, mainly in London\u2019s cleaning industry. The union claims the cleaners were unfairly dismissed by CCM shortly after WeWork said it no longer wanted them on its premises. It claims there was insufficient evidence to prove allegations of misconduct made against the cleaners. Alberto Durango, CAIWU general secretary, said: \u201cEach of the [four] cases was so-called third-party pressure, which is the client \u2013 in this case WeWork \u2013 saying we don\u2019t want these people here. They\u2019re the clients and they requested the removal of these guys. They have the power to say to CCM to reinstate these workers. For a cleaner, they really need their job.\u201d While the client has the right to say they no longer want a person on its premises, \u201cthey shouldn\u2019t be as arrogant [as] to say \u2018I don\u2019t want this person here\u2019\u201d, said Durango. Three of the dismissed workers were originally from Colombia and one from Ecuador. The details of their cases vary. One, Julian Ortiz, says he asked a member of security at the Paddington branch of WeWork where he worked if he could borrow a projector, and that they agreed. When the company told him the staff member didn\u2019t have the authority to agree to that, he brought the projector back promptly, he says. He was suspended by CCM a few days later, he says. He\u2019s now found part-time work, but misses his old job: \u201cI felt so happy when I was working with WeWork.\u201d Another, Jorge Montoya, says his daughter was working at the same WeWork branch that he was, so WeWork requested he be moved to another one. He claims CCM offered him work at another site but later dismissed him. A third worker, who doesn\u2019t speak fluent English, was cleaning a staircase when someone approached the wet floor, said Durango. \u201cIn broken English he says \u2018don\u2019t pass\u2019\u201d and the person took offence, the CAIWU general secretary said. A fourth cleaner was accused of making a racist remark to a member of staff, a claim he denies. While outsourcing isn\u2019t a new phenomenon, the scale of it is \u2013 it\u2019s one of the biggest growth industries in the past decade. Cleaners, security guards and catering staff at multinational companies, universities, hospitals and other big organisations (including the Guardian) are often employed by other companies. The two-tier system means the balance of power at outsourcing firms is firmly in favour of the client: they won\u2019t want to lose a valuable customer.

There seems to have been a hangover into 2019, with customers calculating that waiting to book is a productive strategy.</p>\n    <p><b>Competition</b><br>A pincer movement of Airbnb and budget holidays has changed consumer behaviour, though Thomas Cook still managed to sell 11m package holidays last year.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Banks and debt</b><br>The tour operator has been attempting to shoulder a&nbsp; huge pile of debt for the past decade \u2013 \u00a31.7bn worth at the last count.

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrass meadows are absorbing about 20m tonnes of carbon dioxide every year, according to a major new study that is the first to measure in detail the climate benefits of the coastal ecosystems. But the study, published in the journal Nature Communications, warns that degradation of these \u201cvegetated coastal ecosystems\u201d was already seeing 3 million tonnes of CO2 per year being released back into the atmosphere. The study reveals Australia\u2019s vast coastlines represent between 5% and 11% of all the so called \u201cblue carbon\u201d locked up in mangroves, seagrasses and tidal marshes globally. Some 44 scientists from 33 different research institutions collaborated on the study, which began in 2014. Dr Oscar Serrano, at Edith Cowan University\u2019s Centre for Marine Ecosystems Research, said it found the coastal ecosystems stored between 4,000m tonnes and 6,300m tonnes of CO2. Australia\u2019s annual emissions hit a record high in 2018 of 558.4m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. Serrano said: \u201cWhen these ecosystems are damaged by storms, heatwaves, dredging or other human development, the carbon dioxide stored in their biomass and soils beneath them can make its way back into the environment, contributing to climate change. \u201cGlobally, vegetated coastal ecosystems are being lost twice as fast as tropical rainforests despite covering a fraction of the area.\u201d Coastal ecosystems store carbon in their soils as well as in the plants themselves and, once absorbed, the carbon can be locked away for thousands of years if undisturbed. They are able to absorb at up to 40 times faster than forests. \u201cThey also protect the coasts from erosion, are important nurseries for fisheries and they clear up the water so it\u2019s very important for several reasons that we preserve these ecosystems,\u201d Serrano said. He said the ecosystems were being impacted by coastal developments, dredging and by climate change. The annual losses of carbon from the coastal ecosystems was the equivalent of a 12% to 21% increase in Australia\u2019s land-use emissions from activities such as land-clearing. In 2015, mangroves on the Gulf of Carpentaria suffered an unprecedented mass dieback along a 1,000-kilometre stretch of coastline that coincided with a major heatwave. Prof Norman Duke, of James Cook University, who was not part of the study, said the advantage of quantifying the carbon stored in mangroves was that it created a \u201cmarketable commodity\u201d that could be used as part of carbon trading schemes. Duke, who is leading a project to assess the mass dieback event, said mangroves were a particularly powerful tool to cut emissions because they had about five times more capacity to store carbon than trees on the land. He said: \u201cBecause we\u2019re trying to reduce the release of carbon into the atmosphere, this gives us a very strong incentive [to protect them]. But that\u2019s not the only benefits that mangroves deliver \u2013 they give habitats to fisheries and protect our coastlines.\u201d Recovery of mangroves in the gulf has been hampered by dead mangroves, broken up by subsequent storms, piling up on areas of new growth. A seperate study has found the Gulf of Carpentaria\u2019s dead mangroves emit eight times the amount of powerful greenhouse gas methane than live mangroves. Dr Andy Steven, coasts research director at CSIRO and a co-author of the research, said: \u201cWhen we started this work in 2014, we had no real numbers. We didn\u2019t know how significant it was, or even if they were worth thinking about.

Amal Clooney proposes UN powers to probe activist deaths On the eve of the anniversary of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s murder by Saudi officials, Amal Clooney has lamented the \u201cglaring gap\u201d in the world\u2019s capacity to investigate such killings. Clooney, the UK special envoy on media freedom, said the UN special rapporteur who led the global body\u2019s investigation of the Khashoggi killing, Agn\u00e8s Callamard, \u201chad been forced heroically to manage a large-scale investigation with ridiculously few resources\u201d. UN investigations. Clooney said she expected a specialist UK legal panel to champion a new UN investigatory mechanism designed specifically to examine state killings of human rights defenders and journalists. Crown prince. In an interview with 60 Minutes to mark the anniversary of Khashoggi\u2019s death on 2 October, the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, insisted he had no prior knowledge of the murder. Johnson\u2019s \u2018secret Irish border plans\u2019 dismissed by Dublin Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, has dismissed as a \u201cnon-starter\u201d proposals by Boris Johnson\u2019s UK government supposedly intended to solve the question of the Irish border after Brexit \u2013 one of the major obstacles to Britain\u2019s departure from the EU. The plans, submitted to Brussels and seen by the Irish broadcaster RT\u00c9, reportedly involve customs sites on both sides of the border, contrary to Johnson\u2019s promise not to reintroduce border infrastructure. Out-of-date? On Tuesday morning, however, Johnson told the BBC that he believed the report was based on out-of-date proposals, insisting he would be making a \u201cvery good offer \u2026 very soon\u201d.

Archaeologists and environmentalists have expressed outrage at Chile\u2019s decision to allow a Dutch-American businessman to use heavy machinery to search for a fabled 18th-century treasure trove on a sparsely populated Pacific island. An iceberg approximately the size of Greater Cleveland has broken away from the Amery ice shelf in Antarctica. Though it is the first major \u201ccalving event\u201d on the Amery shelf for 55 years, scientists do not believe it is related to climate change. Must-reads The 13 children killed by guns in St Louis \u2013 in just six months Seven-year-old Xavier Usanga was shot dead in a crossfire outside his home in August, a day before he was due to start second grade.

Debbie Harry on heroin, rape and staying happy at 74 The Blondie frontwoman has more good and bad experiences than most to pack into her new memoir, Face It. \u201cYou look back, and you think about all the mistakes you made,\u201d she tells Emine Saner. \u201cBut, all in all, I guess I\u2019ve been very lucky.\u201d The iPhone 11 reviewed The iPhone 11 looks superficially identical to the iPhone XR, says Samuel Gibbs, the Guardian\u2019s consumer technology editor. But Apple\u2019s new lower cost smartphone has a better camera than its predecessor, and a longer battery life. Cinema and the art of interior design Interior design in films is an integral part of the narrative, writes the design critic Caroline Roux, with the power to add psychological layers to the action. Two contrasting cases in point: The Souvenir by Joanna Hogg, and Pedro Almod\u00f3var\u2019s Pain and Glory.

The first, the short-term one, is transition. It\u2019s an excuse made easier by the impatience of so much of football\u2019s culture. Any manager can brush off a defeat or a run of poor form by saying his side is in transition. When the sack comes they can claim they just needed more time. Sometimes it is true. Among the most vivid of all the memories that haunt Old Trafford is the reaction to the 2-1 defeat against Crystal Palace in December 1989. The bedsheet bemoaning \u201cthree years of excuses\u201d may be the most famous manifestation of the discontent but the fans en masse were in uproar.</p> \n<p>Six months later, United won the FA Cup and 23 years of success under Alex Ferguson had begun.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s easy now to wonder what might have happened had the board not held its nerve, had Mark Robins not scored that winner at Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup. If memories of that season and an instance when the transition was demonstrably in the right direction incline fans to caution now it is understandable. But often transition is just another word for stagnation.</p> \n<p>That season 30 years ago feels particularly relevant now. This is the fewest points United have had after seven games of a league season since then. Such judgments are subjective, but this feels the weakest squad United have had since then, certainly relative to the rest of the league. It\u2019s not necessarily straightforward to tell in the moment but back then there was a clear plan as Ferguson refashioned and professionalised the squad. Can anybody, looking at this squad, at the recent transfers in and out, honestly say they can see a clear policy?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e5a437b282be0f87e5ebbb1c38f5d2d338a781c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e5a437b282be0f87e5ebbb1c38f5d2d338a781c/0_0_3000_2163/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A wide shot of Old Trafford during Monday\u2019s match.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"721\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A wide shot of Old Trafford during Monday\u2019s match.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Peters/Manchester United via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Does anybody have any faith, even if fortunes are splurged, that things will be better in two transfer widows?

United have won only once since their opening 4-0 victory over Chelsea, with Marcus Rashford's penalty earning them a 1-0 home win against Leicester.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Fall from grace:</b>&nbsp;It is just two years since Jos\u00e9 Mourinho oversaw United's joint-best start to a Premier League season. United claimed 19 points from their first seven games in 2017-18, equalling the starts made by Sir Alex Ferguson's sides in 1999-2000 and 2011-12. United finished runners-up under Mourinho that season, but a whopping 19 points adrift of champions Manchester City.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Ole at the wheel:</b> The figures make bleak reading for Solskj\u00e6r when comparing the Norwegian's record with his predecessors. Mourinho \u2013 who would be sacked in December \u2013 made a poor start last season, but his 10-point haul from the first seven games was still one more than Solskj\u00e6r has managed 12 months on. David Moyes also took 10 points from his first seven games in the 2013-14 season, while Louis van Gaal won 11 and 16 points in the respective 2014-15 and 2015-16 campaigns.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>30-year low:</b> The last time United made such a poor start to a campaign was under Ferguson in the days of the old First Division. United picked up only seven points from their first seven games of the 1989-90 season, a run that brought successive defeats to Derby, Norwich and Everton and ended with a famous 5-1 thrashing by Manchester City at Maine Road. United ended up 13th that season, but lifted the FA Cup as Ferguson won his first trophy in England. <b>PA Media</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>A lack of planning, a lack of nous, are beginning to affect the financial picture.

Commercial revenue, meanwhile, has essentially stagnated over the past four years \u2013 although it remains 18.5% higher than that of City, who are second in that particular chart. Ed Woodward may be a genius at finding sponsors and partners in every market, and there\u2019s no reason for panic just yet, but slowly underperformance in the league is beginning to have an impact.</p> \n<p>After nine points from seven games this season, after 19 goals in their last 21 games, after an awkwardly imbalanced side lurched to another less-than-impressive result, the temptation is to start looking down rather than up.

      "bodyText": "Everywhere you turned, there were the memories. In the tunnel, there was Roy Keane telling Patrick Vieira he\u2019d see him out there. By the touchline there was Gary Neville kicking Jos\u00e9 Antonio Reyes. Just outside the penalty area, there was Martin Keown jostling Ruud van Nistelrooy. Remember? Remember how every man knew when we reached out to claim the throne? Remember when we were kings? Those pre-Abramovich days when this was the biggest game in English football seem a long time ago now, two decades gone with atrocious haste. Manchester United and Arsenal aren\u2019t even the best sides in their respective cities any more and on nights like Monday it was impossible not to wonder how long it will take them to get back to where they were, whether they ever will get back. There are two great lies in football. The first, the short-term one, is transition. It\u2019s an excuse made easier by the impatience of so much of football\u2019s culture. Any manager can brush off a defeat or a run of poor form by saying his side is in transition. When the sack comes they can claim they just needed more time. Sometimes it is true. Among the most vivid of all the memories that haunt Old Trafford is the reaction to the 2-1 defeat against Crystal Palace in December 1989. The bedsheet bemoaning \u201cthree years of excuses\u201d may be the most famous manifestation of the discontent but the fans en masse were in uproar. Six months later, United won the FA Cup and 23 years of success under Alex Ferguson had begun. It\u2019s easy now to wonder what might have happened had the board not held its nerve, had Mark Robins not scored that winner at Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup. If memories of that season and an instance when the transition was demonstrably in the right direction incline fans to caution now it is understandable. But often transition is just another word for stagnation. That season 30 years ago feels particularly relevant now. This is the fewest points United have had after seven games of a league season since then. Such judgments are subjective, but this feels the weakest squad United have had since then, certainly relative to the rest of the league. It\u2019s not necessarily straightforward to tell in the moment but back then there was a clear plan as Ferguson refashioned and professionalised the squad. Can anybody, looking at this squad, at the recent transfers in and out, honestly say they can see a clear policy? Does anybody have any faith, even if fortunes are splurged, that things will be better in two transfer widows? In four? In six? Football\u2019s other great lie is that success is cyclical, as though if you\u2019re big enough things will come good if you wait long enough. Squads have cycles, it\u2019s true, and whoever is in charge of long-term development, be that a manager or a sporting director, must manage the age profile of a team while fighting a constant war with entropy \u2013 but those are the details. There is also a macro picture and it\u2019s that that must be of serious concern for United. A lack of planning, a lack of nous, are beginning to affect the financial picture. United\u2019s latest financial results show a record wage bill of \u00a3332m, 43% up on three years ago and 22% higher than the club with the next highest wages in the Premier League, Liverpool.

But then English cricket has a history of missing the top line with India, Twenty20 and shifting tectonic plates. Like it or not the IPL is an expansionist force. It has to grow, has to stretch its tentacles. The franchise system offers this. A franchise, unlike a country, can be marketed and finessed as a brand, ranked on a scale of nought to Real Madrid or the Dallas Cowboys. There has already been talk of IPL franchises expanding via merger and acquisitions into the leagues of other countries. The Rajasthan Royals enter the Hundred: it won\u2019t happen in any version of the future that doesn\u2019t involve the cricketing public marching on ECB HQ brandishing pitchforks and lighted torches. For now the IPL will content itself with talk of fan parks, with an expansionist broadcast strategy (up significantly in the UK in the last two years) and with its seed planted in deepest Surrey. Something will grow here. It might be a tranche of fast-tracked English-born IPL players. Or simply a sense that the wild, aggressively entrepreneurial spirit of big sport, with all its collateral damage and brutal modernity, might just be the way to grow this cobwebbed old summer game in whatever direction it can find. \u2022 This is an extract taken from the Spin, the Guardian\u2019s weekly cricket email.

The suggestion is that he will seek to quietly build on that with further NI-only arrangements.</p>\n    <p>Given an NI-only backstop was an EU proposal in the first place, the U-turn would be warmly welcomed in Brussels, although attempts to give the Northern Ireland assembly a veto on its continuation would not be acceptable, and the DUP would be unlikely to support the prime minister in such a move in parliament.</p>\n    <p>If there is a no-deal Brexit, then there is no backstop.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/daniel-boffey\"><b>Daniel Boffey</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>He conceded there would ultimately need to be customs checks in some form, adding: \u201cA sovereign united country must have a single customs territory \u2026 but there are plenty of ways we can facilitate north-south trade, plenty of ways we can address the problem.\u201d</p> \n<p>He said the offer he planned on delivering to the EU was \u201cvery good\u201d and would be revealed soon.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has denied the UK government was proposing to install customs clearance zones several miles away from the Irish border after Brexit to get around the controversial backstop arrangement. The leaked plan, which appeared in the Irish media and has heightened concerns over a return to a hard border, was described as \u201cnot quite right\u201d by the prime minister. But in a series of media interviews on Tuesday he would not explain what kind of Brexit plan he would be delivering to Brussels in the coming days, describing it only as \u201cvery good\u201d. Asked on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme if the string of customs checkpoints located five to 10 miles from the border in both Northern Ireland and Ireland was a possibility, Johnson said: \u201cThat is not what we are proposing at all.\u201d He conceded there would ultimately need to be customs checks in some form, adding: \u201cA sovereign united country must have a single customs territory \u2026 but there are plenty of ways we can facilitate north-south trade, plenty of ways we can address the problem.\u201d He said the offer he planned on delivering to the EU was \u201cvery good\u201d and would be revealed soon.

      "body": "<p>Enable\u2019s path to a third Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe success has become slightly smoother with the news that the Japanese star Deirdre will not oppose her on Sunday.</p> \n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/01/japanese-celebrate-landmark-glorious-goodwood-win-deirdre-nassau-stakes-horse-racing\">shock winner of the Nassau Stakes</a> this summer and an unlucky fourth in the Irish Champion Stakes last time, Deirdre was seen by some observers as an interesting alternative to the hot favourite for the Longchamp race.</p> \n<p>Her connections, however, have decided against stumping up the six-figure sum required to enter her at Wednesday\u2019s supplementary stage.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/sep/30/talking-horses-is-cocaine-growing-problem-british-racing-unlikely\">Talking Horses: Is cocaine a growing problem in British racing? Unlikely</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Instead, Deirdre will add international lustre to British Champions Day at Ascot a fortnight on Saturday. \u201cThe plan is for Deirdre to go for the Champion Stakes,\u201d said Oisin Murphy, who has ridden Mitsuru Hashida\u2019s mare in her past two races.</p> \n<p>\u201cHer connections are pleased with her since the Irish Champion Stakes, where she should have finished closer. She\u2019s a very good mare and it\u2019s great we are getting another opportunity to see her in Britain.\u201d</p> \n<p>Deirdre is a general 16-1 shot for the Champion Stakes, the last of the 20-1 having disappeared during Monday. It is hard to be sure what quality of opposition she would face there as the top four in the betting \u2013 Japan, Magical, Ghaiyyath and Enable \u2013 are all expected to run in the Arc, so their presence at Ascot would depend on what happens this weekend.</p> \n<p>A tilt at the Breeders\u2019 Cup in the US next month must be a possibility for Deirdre, especially as she is thought to appreciate fast ground. But Murphy believes Ascot is the main target for her owner and trainer, at least for the time being.</p> \n<p>There are 16 horses left in the Arc, following Monday\u2019s declaration stage, including three Japanese representatives in Fierement, Blast Onepiece and Kiseki. Britain has the same number of possible runners in Enable, Mehdaayih and Ghaiyyath.</p> \n<p>Enable came safely through her final serious bit of work on Monday morning, when she covered seven furlongs on Newmarket\u2019s Limekilns gallops. \u201cFrankie [Dettori] was happy with her and hopefully we can get through the next six days,\u201d her trainer, John Gosden, told the Racing Post.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Jean-Claude Rouget offered little help to punters as he discussed the Arc chances of his French Derby winner, Sottsass. \u201cI am going into the Arc with confidence, but with a horse who has never encountered Enable, who has never encountered Japan, who has never really met anyone,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cSo I have no reference. I can\u2019t say he is going to take his revenge or anything. I don\u2019t know. What I do know is that the horse is looking good, he is in good form. Everything is all right.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Tuesday\u2019s best bets</h2> \n<p>Jumpers usually get a sound surface at Southwell but the overnight rain has made it soft in places there and that could be good news for <strong>Applaus (3.40)</strong>, who put up a few good efforts on testing surfaces a couple of winters back. After a spell pointing, he\u2019s back with Micky Hammond and a couple of modest efforts on good ground have got him down to an attractive rating.</p> \n<p>He\u2019s 10lb below his last winning mark, so here\u2019s hoping the mud and the fitting of blinkers spark a revival. At 14-1, it\u2019s a chance I can take.</p> \n<p>At Sedgefield, there\u2019s been some support for <strong>Squouateur (4.30)</strong>, now 4-1 for the staying handicap hurdle. JP McManus\u2019s grey has been backed, mostly unsuccessfully, for much better races than this in his time, of course, and it was only last year that he was third in the Kim Muir.

      "bodyText": "Enable\u2019s path to a third Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe success has become slightly smoother with the news that the Japanese star Deirdre will not oppose her on Sunday. A shock winner of the Nassau Stakes this summer and an unlucky fourth in the Irish Champion Stakes last time, Deirdre was seen by some observers as an interesting alternative to the hot favourite for the Longchamp race. Her connections, however, have decided against stumping up the six-figure sum required to enter her at Wednesday\u2019s supplementary stage. Instead, Deirdre will add international lustre to British Champions Day at Ascot a fortnight on Saturday. \u201cThe plan is for Deirdre to go for the Champion Stakes,\u201d said Oisin Murphy, who has ridden Mitsuru Hashida\u2019s mare in her past two races. \u201cHer connections are pleased with her since the Irish Champion Stakes, where she should have finished closer. She\u2019s a very good mare and it\u2019s great we are getting another opportunity to see her in Britain.\u201d Deirdre is a general 16-1 shot for the Champion Stakes, the last of the 20-1 having disappeared during Monday. It is hard to be sure what quality of opposition she would face there as the top four in the betting \u2013 Japan, Magical, Ghaiyyath and Enable \u2013 are all expected to run in the Arc, so their presence at Ascot would depend on what happens this weekend. A tilt at the Breeders\u2019 Cup in the US next month must be a possibility for Deirdre, especially as she is thought to appreciate fast ground. But Murphy believes Ascot is the main target for her owner and trainer, at least for the time being. There are 16 horses left in the Arc, following Monday\u2019s declaration stage, including three Japanese representatives in Fierement, Blast Onepiece and Kiseki. Britain has the same number of possible runners in Enable, Mehdaayih and Ghaiyyath. Enable came safely through her final serious bit of work on Monday morning, when she covered seven furlongs on Newmarket\u2019s Limekilns gallops. \u201cFrankie [Dettori] was happy with her and hopefully we can get through the next six days,\u201d her trainer, John Gosden, told the Racing Post. Meanwhile, Jean-Claude Rouget offered little help to punters as he discussed the Arc chances of his French Derby winner, Sottsass. \u201cI am going into the Arc with confidence, but with a horse who has never encountered Enable, who has never encountered Japan, who has never really met anyone,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I have no reference. I can\u2019t say he is going to take his revenge or anything. I don\u2019t know. What I do know is that the horse is looking good, he is in good form. Everything is all right.\u201d Tuesday\u2019s best bets Jumpers usually get a sound surface at Southwell but the overnight rain has made it soft in places there and that could be good news for Applaus (3.40), who put up a few good efforts on testing surfaces a couple of winters back. After a spell pointing, he\u2019s back with Micky Hammond and a couple of modest efforts on good ground have got him down to an attractive rating. He\u2019s 10lb below his last winning mark, so here\u2019s hoping the mud and the fitting of blinkers spark a revival. At 14-1, it\u2019s a chance I can take. At Sedgefield, there\u2019s been some support for Squouateur (4.30), now 4-1 for the staying handicap hurdle. JP McManus\u2019s grey has been backed, mostly unsuccessfully, for much better races than this in his time, of course, and it was only last year that he was third in the Kim Muir. His form since joining Ben Haslam does not encourage but the soft ground could make a difference and he is certainly on a fair mark. Irish raiders are always worth a second look at Ayr and Highway To Heaven (1.50) appeals at 6-1 in the opener. Her form last month at Gowran easily makes her a contender in this company. Sagittarius Rising (4.20) finished fast but just too late at Listowel last month on his fourth start for John McConnell. Support for a couple of others has allowed him to drift to 9-1, which seems too big.",

Following revelations on Tuesday that prime minister Scott Morrison had agreed to a request from Trump to assist the US justice department\u2019s inquiry into the FBI\u2019s investigation of alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election, Payne said Australia was behaving as expected of an ally. \u201cI don\u2019t see it as Australia being dragged into a US political issue,\u201d Payne told ABC radio. \u201cWe\u2019re conducting ourselves as you would expect us to do in these circumstances, we are working in Australia\u2019s interests and we are working with our closest and most important ally.\u201d When asked what information Australia would be relaying to Attorney General William Barr who is leading the investigation, Payne did not elaborate. \u201cIn terms of material or information that would be exchanged, it is not my practice to comment on the use of intelligence, and secure material but as I said we\u2019ll cooperate as far as we can,\u201d she said. Labor leader Anthony Albanese called on the government to release the transcript of the call between Morrison and Trump, saying Australians needed a \u201cfull explanation\u201d of what he said was an \u201cextraordinary\u201d offer. \u201cThe prime minister needs to just be straight with the Australian people about what\u2019s going on here,\u201d Albanese said. The government\u2019s defence of its decision comes after revelations in Guardian Australia on Wednesday that Alexander Downer took the then prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and senior colleagues by surprise when he relayed information to the American charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires in London in July 2016 about his now infamous conversation with George Papadopoulos, then a foreign policy adviser to Trump. Guardian Australia understands Downer\u2019s conversation with Papadopoulos was recorded in a diplomatic cable back to Canberra. But the first senior players in Canberra knew of Downer\u2019s conversation with America\u2019s top diplomat in London about Russia obtaining damaging information about Hillary Clinton from her emails was when the Australian government was contacted subsequently by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for more information. That diplomat-to-diplomat conversation, sources insist, was unauthorised. Controversy about the conversations in 2016 has been revived courtesy of Donald Trump\u2019s appeal to Scott Morrison for Australia\u2019s assistance in an investigation aimed at discrediting the Mueller inquiry. The New York Times revealed on Tuesday that Trump made the call to Morrison shortly before the Australian prime minister departed for a visit to America last week. After the call was made public by the Times, Morrison\u2019s office confirmed it. The conversation between the two leaders was, according to a government source, a \u201cpolite request\u201d from Trump to cooperate with an investigation being spearheaded by the US attorney general, William Barr. Barr\u2019s inquiry is an investigation of the investigators. Trump has given the attorney general the unilateral authority to declassify intelligence documents and has ordered the US intelligence community to \u201cquickly and fully cooperate\u201d. Trump in the call to Morrison sought a point of contact to facilitate Australia\u2019s cooperation with Barr\u2019s investigation. It is unclear what, if any, specific commitments Morrison has made in response to that request. Downer, a former foreign affairs minister during the Howard era, and at the time of his conversation with Papadopoulos, Australia\u2019s high commissioner in London, told the ABC on Tuesday he had no knowledge of Morrison\u2019s recent conversation with Trump. \u201cThese days it\u2019s not something I am privy to,\u201d Downer told the ABC. \u201cI had a conversation with this guy [Papadopoulos], I passed on one element of the convo to the Americans.

Guardian Australia has contacted Downer for comment about the events of 2016 but the inquiries went unanswered. Trump is under escalating pressure in Washington with calls for his impeachment triggered by a separate conversation with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the president of Ukraine. At the root of the gathering impeachment storm in the American capital is a complaint from a whistleblower \u2013 believed to be an intelligence official \u2013 that Trump was using the power of his presidential office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 election. It is unclear why Trump contacted Morrison in advance of his visit to secure Australia\u2019s cooperation with the Barr investigation rather than raising it during the prime minister\u2019s time in Washington. Morrison dead batted a reporter\u2019s question during his visit about whether Downer had come up. \u201cWell I\u2019m not going to go into private conversations but what we were discussing yesterday were issues about our strategic relationship from trade,\u201d he said. \u201cThe frontier technologies, our defence relationships, these were not issues that were there for discussion.\u201d The dialogue between the Trump administration and the Morrison government about cooperation with the Barr investigation has apparently been playing out for some months. On 25 May, Trump blasted Australia before leaving on a trip to Japan, declaring he wanted Australia\u2019s role in setting off the FBI inquiry into links between Russia and his election campaign examined by Barr. Trump said he hoped Barr would \u201clook at the UK and I hope he looks at Australia and I hope he looks at Ukraine.

Her debut sounded as though it had been recorded by lamplight in a poorly insulated shack; later records reinvigorated classic rock\u2019n\u2019roll and weepies worthy of Roy Orbison. On Lark, she harnesses high romanticism, the lux drama of classic Hollywood. It\u2019s a hard sound to land without veering into pastiche, let alone to hold one\u2019s own amid the heavy arrangements. But Olsen commands the scene. She teases out the details of a relationship that crumbled into the void of disconnection, the soft production accruing a potent charge. Then the tension snaps: \u201cWhat about my dreams?\u201d she howls, addressing a former lover who failed to see her for who she truly was. As the strings go off like a fireworks display comprised entirely of screamer rockets, the blinkered sod is left in no uncertain terms about the magnitude of her desires.<em> LS</em></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce1lTmRtIkM\">DaBaby \u2013 Intro</a></h2> <p>The rap breakthrough of the year award has to go to DaBaby, who has just released Kirk, his second album of 2019 following the excellent Baby on Baby. The first album was mostly fixated on guns, wealth and \u2013 as track titles such as Carpet Burn and Baby Sitter allude \u2013 shagging. But Intro announces that Kirk is rather more soul-searching. With his HD alpha-male delivery, DaBaby tells of his pre-fame poverty, and the pain of his father dying at the same time that he finally became successful. It prompts a reflection on the enduring power of family and friendship even through the complicating factors of newfound fame and wealth. <em>BBT</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f1667ab87ed3712ded8779233035c4a2541ae5dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1667ab87ed3712ded8779233035c4a2541ae5dd/0_0_4928_3280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"None more emo \u2026 Touch\u00e9 Amor\u00e9.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">None more emo \u2026 Touch\u00e9 Amor\u00e9.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Cordon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d14ZN3ZS7B4\">Touch\u00e9 Amor\u00e9 \u2013 Deflector</a></h2> <p>This LA post-hardcore five-piece aren\u2019t so much in touch with their feelings as sending them a constant stream of extremely earnest WhatsApps. A decade into their career, they follow their recently rerecorded debut with this first track from their forthcoming new album, and the lyrics from frontman Jeremy Bolm are almost self-parodic in their emo-ness: \u201cA last responder to my own self interest \u2026 Cold-shouldered by design,\u201d he laments. \u201cI\u2019m a secondhand piano / Incapable of tune / Providing the score / For gone too soon.\u201d But boy, does he sell them \u2013 the chorus would be anthemic sung by anyone, but is made gloriously so by Bolm\u2019s acute feeling. <em>BBT</em></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cImu0i8tzsI\">Brittany Howard \u2013 Goat Head</a></h2> <p>It\u2019s tough to pick a standout from Brittany Howard\u2019s remarkable debut solo album, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/sep/20/brittany-howard-jaime-review\">Jaime</a>. But even on this intimate, exposing record, Goat Head cuts deeper than everything else. It\u2019s a break from the album\u2019s diffuse blues, hooked instead around a lilting piano loop. Howard layers it as she assembles her child\u2019s-eye understanding of colour: first learning red from green, the way your parents teach you. Then, starker differences: having a white mother and a black father in a southern town, and how that prompted a hate crime; slashed tyres, a goat\u2019s head on the back seat. The stumbling joins in the looped piano become fissures as the younger Howard becomes painfully cognisant of the world\u2019s gaping inconsistencies; more unsettling is how Howard and her backing vocalists turn \u201cgoat head in the back\u201d into a sensual, soothing refrain.<em> LS</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0ef762b487ac5d4b3b5556c33263b377f388c000\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ef762b487ac5d4b3b5556c33263b377f388c000/0_0_3059_1972/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bittersweet beauty \u2026 Mary Lattimore.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"645\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bittersweet beauty \u2026 Mary Lattimore.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rachael Pony Cassells</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://marylattimoreharpist.bandcamp.com/track/quintana\">Mary Lattimore \u2013 Quintana</a></h2> <p>Left over from the recording of her 2018 album Hundreds of Days, Quintana finds harpist Mary Lattimore at her most expansive and melancholy. Her glassy playing is subsumed by static fog, which, across 15 eventful minutes, swells and eddies, blurring the precision of her playing and building to an unexpected bass note that hits like a cataclysmic omen. The track also calls to mind the imposing tundras of Canadian drone composer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/05/tim-hecker-sacred-music-ambient-electronica-4ad\">Tim Hecker</a>\u2019s defining Ravedeath, 1972. Given that it\u2019s an outtake from an album with which it has little in common, it\u2019s hard to tell whether it indicates a new creative horizon or an abandoned idea for Lattimore. Either way, its bittersweet beauty and lingering sense of doom feels arrestingly contemporary for this moment in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change\">the climate crisis</a>. <em>LS</em></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=louOvBOFPnQ\">(Sandy) Alex G \u2013 Southern Sky</a></h2> <p>Although he was recently and no doubt mendaciously <a href=\"https://www.stereogum.com/2058721/beto-o-rourke-sandy-alex-g-fake-viral-photo/news/\">mistaken for Beto O\u2019Rourke by right-wing trolls</a>, (Sandy) Alex G could never actually mount a credible Democratic candidacy campaign \u2013 he\u2019s so horizontally chill you can barely imagine him mounting his stairs most days. But that demeanour has made the singer-songwriter \u2013 and Frank Ocean\u2019s sometime guitarist \u2013 one of the best of his generation, with songs that rarely resolve in the way you expect them to. Southern Sky, from excellent new album House of Sugar, is the perfect entry point to his catalogue, with its Beach Boys-style naivety to the vocals and the playground-chant melody in the outro. <em>BBT</em></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1gVdXIjOUs\">Lou Rebecca \u2013 Desire</a></h2> <p>Texas-based French pop auteur Lou Rebecca trades in fantasy: she makes dreamy lounge pop that\u2019s as featherlight as a pink macaron, her sexy-baby vocals in debt to countrywoman Brigitte Bardot. (It\u2019s been a good year for it. See also: Swiss singer Vendredi sur Mer\u2019s debut, Premiers Emois.) But the fantasy is all hers. On Desire, she beseeches a lover to get closer, tell her everything, says she\u2019ll be anything they want. But her plan, it turns out, is more Villanelle than Valentine: \u201cJe plante mes crocs dans ta chair,\u201d she coos \u2013 I\u2019ll sink my fangs into your flesh \u2013 taking revenge against men who treat women like wish-fulfilment machines. They should have seen it coming: the insouciant yet relentless disco beat speaks to a strategic mind hard at work behind the deceptively sugary facade.<em> LS</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee1c5bfeee4c2fd06436e7db2349a9cdc2700fbe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee1c5bfeee4c2fd06436e7db2349a9cdc2700fbe/97_81_2309_1682/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hot property \u2026 James Massiah.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"728\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hot property \u2026 James Massiah.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Kurunis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCqDTJfBmF8\">James Massiah \u2013 Natural Born Killers (Ride for Me)</a></h2> <p>Set in an equatorial city, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCqDTJfBmF8\">the gripping video</a> for south London poet/rapper James Massiah\u2019s debut single depicts people struggling to go about their everyday business in apocalyptic heat \u2013 so hot that an egg frying on the pavement becomes an omen for their fate. The track is as cool as the clip is sweltering: Massiah connects the threads from eski to dancehall and the slower end of acid house, unspooling a nonchalant devotional amid a cocky bassline and glacial, ravey synths that sparkle enticingly. <em>LS</em></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HPpMzN0xns\">Toshifumi Hinata \u2013 Atarashii Yuhbokumin</a></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/feb/19/lullabies-for-air-conditioners-the-corporate-bliss-of-japanese-ambient\">Japanese ambient</a> is the latest frontier in reissue culture: following the Kanky\u014d Ongaku compilation earlier this year, and albums by Yutaka Hirose, Midori Takada, Takashi Kukobo and Hiroshi Yoshimura all recently returning to circulation, next up is Toshifumi Hinata, whose best bits have been collected as the album Broken Belief this month by the Music from Memory label. There are big synth-y fantasias, drifting chordscapes and pristine piano notes, but the best moments are the more fleshed-out rhythm tracks. Atarashii Yuhbokumin has a bossa nova energy to its drum machine pulse, creating a sensual space for its affecting central piano melody and jazzy bass solo. <em>BBT</em></p>",

LS (Sandy) Alex G \u2013 Southern Sky Although he was recently and no doubt mendaciously mistaken for Beto O\u2019Rourke by right-wing trolls, (Sandy) Alex G could never actually mount a credible Democratic candidacy campaign \u2013 he\u2019s so horizontally chill you can barely imagine him mounting his stairs most days. But that demeanour has made the singer-songwriter \u2013 and Frank Ocean\u2019s sometime guitarist \u2013 one of the best of his generation, with songs that rarely resolve in the way you expect them to. Southern Sky, from excellent new album House of Sugar, is the perfect entry point to his catalogue, with its Beach Boys-style naivety to the vocals and the playground-chant melody in the outro. BBT Lou Rebecca \u2013 Desire Texas-based French pop auteur Lou Rebecca trades in fantasy: she makes dreamy lounge pop that\u2019s as featherlight as a pink macaron, her sexy-baby vocals in debt to countrywoman Brigitte Bardot. (It\u2019s been a good year for it. See also: Swiss singer Vendredi sur Mer\u2019s debut, Premiers Emois.) But the fantasy is all hers. On Desire, she beseeches a lover to get closer, tell her everything, says she\u2019ll be anything they want. But her plan, it turns out, is more Villanelle than Valentine: \u201cJe plante mes crocs dans ta chair,\u201d she coos \u2013 I\u2019ll sink my fangs into your flesh \u2013 taking revenge against men who treat women like wish-fulfilment machines. They should have seen it coming: the insouciant yet relentless disco beat speaks to a strategic mind hard at work behind the deceptively sugary facade. LS James Massiah \u2013 Natural Born Killers (Ride for Me) Set in an equatorial city, the gripping video for south London poet/rapper James Massiah\u2019s debut single depicts people struggling to go about their everyday business in apocalyptic heat \u2013 so hot that an egg frying on the pavement becomes an omen for their fate. The track is as cool as the clip is sweltering: Massiah connects the threads from eski to dancehall and the slower end of acid house, unspooling a nonchalant devotional amid a cocky bassline and glacial, ravey synths that sparkle enticingly. LS Toshifumi Hinata \u2013 Atarashii Yuhbokumin Japanese ambient is the latest frontier in reissue culture: following the Kanky\u014d Ongaku compilation earlier this year, and albums by Yutaka Hirose, Midori Takada, Takashi Kukobo and Hiroshi Yoshimura all recently returning to circulation, next up is Toshifumi Hinata, whose best bits have been collected as the album Broken Belief this month by the Music from Memory label. There are big synth-y fantasias, drifting chordscapes and pristine piano notes, but the best moments are the more fleshed-out rhythm tracks. Atarashii Yuhbokumin has a bossa nova energy to its drum machine pulse, creating a sensual space for its affecting central piano melody and jazzy bass solo. BBT",

It was too rigid a reaction when they could have let it play out longer and swap them later in the race, as they ultimately did. With both championships in effect gone, what is extraordinary is that they are still trying to run their men to a script rather than letting them race. Vettel will doubtless believe he was right to refuse to slow down and Leclerc that the German went back on an agreement \u2013 a recipe for disharmony \u2013 but their team principal, Mattia Binotto, chose to look on the bright side. \u201cI still believe it\u2019s a luxury,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have got two fantastic drivers, therefore that\u2019s where I\u2019m starting from.\u201d Corriere dello Sport was perhaps closer to the truth with their headline: \u201cFerrari, this is war\u201d</p> <h2>Mercedes make hay towards title</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/29/lewis-hamilton-wins-russian-grand-prix-formula-one-f1\">Lewis Hamilton wins Russia F1 GP as Vettel ignores orders before retiring</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, knows only too well how quickly such situations can become toxic. He has explained in the past how Lewis Hamilton\u2019s relationship with Nico Rosberg deteriorated to such an extent it had a negative effect on the team. \u201cIt shows you that it isn\u2019t trivial at all to manage two drivers that have the aspiration to win. As a team we have been through this and it\u2019s certainly not easy,\u201d he said in Sochi. What Mercedes displayed in contrast was another masterclass in maximising their position. Their strategy choice was bold on the medium tyres and Hamilton exploited it perfectly. They were lucky with the virtual safety car and Vettel\u2019s MGU-K failure but had ensured they were there to take advantage. Wolff\u2019s reaction was a lesson for Ferrari. \u201cThe result shows you must never give up, even if you go into the race with a package that is not the quickest,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you do things right, all of those things, the drivers, the engineers and the management, then you can still win races.\u201d</p> <h2>Albon on and on</h2> <p>Alexander Albon had not been enjoying the best of weekends for Red Bull. He was unhappy with the feel of his car through practice and then crashed in qualifying. He then made setup changes that meant he had to start from the pit lane. When it mattered, however, he found his form superbly. From 20th he finished fifth, having driven through the field. He was lucky with the timing of the safety car but what really stood out were the passes he pulled off to come back, making bold moves against Daniil Kvyat, Pierre Gasly, Kevin Magnussen and Carlos Sainz. The London-born Thai was in only his fourth race for Red Bull and he is already only 17 points behind Gasly, whom he replaced and who had 12 races with Red Bull to amass his score. Sixth in the championship is in Albon\u2019s sights and this performance has surely all but sealed his seat for Red Bull next season.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b600eee39fd9615ba148d226375c6925f27188ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b600eee39fd9615ba148d226375c6925f27188ea/0_0_5086_3391/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alexander Albon during the Russian GP.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alexander Albon during the Russian GP.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Thompson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>New formats still unloved</h2> <p>F1\u2019s sporting director, Ross Brawn, insisted the proposals for changing the qualifying format next season at two or three races had \u201cunanimous support\u201d from the teams. The drivers, however, seemed equally united in their scepticism for a host of potential changes coming with the 2021 regulations. The most controversial proposal is that of reverse grid qualifying, which Hamilton once again dismissed. \u201cThe fact they are trying the reverse grid feels like an excuse for not doing a good enough job,\u201d he said. He and other drivers have stressed there would be no need for such an idea if the cars were better able to race and aired fundamental fears for 2021. \u201cWe are moving to worse tyres, heavier cars and being more sluggish. And when you speak to these guys who are making the rules they just don\u2019t understand. Pretty much all of them haven\u2019t raced or even been in a F1 car.\u201d Their objections have been noted, Brawn said, but F1 seems almost certain at least to try the reverse grid concept next season \u2013 an experiment worth making before committing to any wholesale changes.</p> <h2>Tight run-in for midfield engine room</h2> <p>For Mercedes concluding a sixth drivers\u2019 and constructors\u2019 championship double now seems inevitable. They will probably tie up the latter at the next round in Japan and Hamilton is on course to seal his sixth title in Mexico. He is ahead of Valtteri Bottas by 73 points and a lead of 78 after the subsequent Mexican Grand Prix will be enough. Ferrari\u2019s improved form looks now to be enough to head off Red Bull for second but the midfield still has much to play for. McLaren in fourth have now broken 100 points \u2013 the first time the team have done so since 2014. They announced this weekend they would be switching to Mercedes engines in 2021, ditching the current supplier, Renault, whom they lead by 33 points. The French marque desperately wants fourth but will need a mighty effort to catch McLaren. However, only 17 points now separate Renault from Toro Rosso and Racing Point. Every one scored for all four will be vital \u2013 the midfield fight will be tooth and nail from here on in.</p>",

He has explained in the past how Lewis Hamilton\u2019s relationship with Nico Rosberg deteriorated to such an extent it had a negative effect on the team. \u201cIt shows you that it isn\u2019t trivial at all to manage two drivers that have the aspiration to win. As a team we have been through this and it\u2019s certainly not easy,\u201d he said in Sochi. What Mercedes displayed in contrast was another masterclass in maximising their position. Their strategy choice was bold on the medium tyres and Hamilton exploited it perfectly. They were lucky with the virtual safety car and Vettel\u2019s MGU-K failure but had ensured they were there to take advantage. Wolff\u2019s reaction was a lesson for Ferrari. \u201cThe result shows you must never give up, even if you go into the race with a package that is not the quickest,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you do things right, all of those things, the drivers, the engineers and the management, then you can still win races.\u201d Albon on and on Alexander Albon had not been enjoying the best of weekends for Red Bull. He was unhappy with the feel of his car through practice and then crashed in qualifying. He then made setup changes that meant he had to start from the pit lane. When it mattered, however, he found his form superbly. From 20th he finished fifth, having driven through the field. He was lucky with the timing of the safety car but what really stood out were the passes he pulled off to come back, making bold moves against Daniil Kvyat, Pierre Gasly, Kevin Magnussen and Carlos Sainz. The London-born Thai was in only his fourth race for Red Bull and he is already only 17 points behind Gasly, whom he replaced and who had 12 races with Red Bull to amass his score. Sixth in the championship is in Albon\u2019s sights and this performance has surely all but sealed his seat for Red Bull next season. New formats still unloved F1\u2019s sporting director, Ross Brawn, insisted the proposals for changing the qualifying format next season at two or three races had \u201cunanimous support\u201d from the teams. The drivers, however, seemed equally united in their scepticism for a host of potential changes coming with the 2021 regulations. The most controversial proposal is that of reverse grid qualifying, which Hamilton once again dismissed. \u201cThe fact they are trying the reverse grid feels like an excuse for not doing a good enough job,\u201d he said. He and other drivers have stressed there would be no need for such an idea if the cars were better able to race and aired fundamental fears for 2021. \u201cWe are moving to worse tyres, heavier cars and being more sluggish. And when you speak to these guys who are making the rules they just don\u2019t understand. Pretty much all of them haven\u2019t raced or even been in a F1 car.\u201d Their objections have been noted, Brawn said, but F1 seems almost certain at least to try the reverse grid concept next season \u2013 an experiment worth making before committing to any wholesale changes. Tight run-in for midfield engine room For Mercedes concluding a sixth drivers\u2019 and constructors\u2019 championship double now seems inevitable. They will probably tie up the latter at the next round in Japan and Hamilton is on course to seal his sixth title in Mexico. He is ahead of Valtteri Bottas by 73 points and a lead of 78 after the subsequent Mexican Grand Prix will be enough. Ferrari\u2019s improved form looks now to be enough to head off Red Bull for second but the midfield still has much to play for. McLaren in fourth have now broken 100 points \u2013 the first time the team have done so since 2014. They announced this weekend they would be switching to Mercedes engines in 2021, ditching the current supplier, Renault, whom they lead by 33 points. The French marque desperately wants fourth but will need a mighty effort to catch McLaren. However, only 17 points now separate Renault from Toro Rosso and Racing Point. Every one scored for all four will be vital \u2013 the midfield fight will be tooth and nail from here on in.",

      "bodyText": "Growing up between abandoned buildings and empty lots, Xavier Usanga brought love and affection whenever he could. Those who knew him say he gave off joy like it was a superpower, enveloping everyone he knew in the glow. Last month, a day before starting second grade, the seven-year-old was shot dead in crossfire outside his home. His story is grimly familiar in St Louis, Missouri, a city of more than 300,000 that sits on the west bank of the Mississippi River and where 13 black children have been fatally shot since April. Had those 13 children died in one fast hail of bullets, that tally would rank in the nation\u2019s 20 deadliest mass shootings. If they had been white, it is likely they would have had more media attention. Instead, these children died in the dilapidated parts of town most people are told to avoid \u2013 sometimes alone, sometimes as family stood helplessly by. In these corners of the city, parents tell their children the loud banging outside is fireworks, but because it is really gunfire, they don\u2019t let them outside to see. Xavier was in his backyard. He was heading back from a neighbor\u2019s house with two of his older sisters \u2013 Trinity, 10, and Angel, 12 \u2013 when gunshots rang out. The girls ran into their home, where they realized Xavier wasn\u2019t with them, and turned back and found his body under a bush. They told their grandmother he took a deep breath and was gone. Michael Johnson, a pastor who helped support the family, was close to Xavier and was with his mother to help identify the body. Johnson said Xavier was \u201ca sponge for love \u2013 he needed it, he absorbed it\u201d. \u201cHe would never walk into a room without coming to give you a hug, whether you saw him an hour earlier or you saw him two weeks ago,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cHe always came, looked at you, and smiled and wanted a hug.\u201d Xavier\u2019s mother, Dawn Usanga, told the Guardian that Xavier \u201clit up every room he walked into\u201d and was popular with many people in their neighborhood. \u201cFor seven years old, I don\u2019t know, he was just so innocent, he was sweet, everybody just took to him,\u201d she said. \u201cI think the only thing that gives me any kind of comfort is that St Louis never got to ruin my son,\u201d Usanga said. \u201cAnything could have gotten to him \u2013 drugs, the violence, the guns, influences of other kids. Children can get turned around so fast and get running and do the wrong things.\u201d \u2018More access to guns than wallets in their back pockets\u2019 For at least four years of Xavier\u2019s short life, St Louis has been the murder capital of the US. It has had the highest gun homicide rate per capita of any big city since 2014. This violence disproportionately affects the city\u2019s poor black neighborhoods, and this year children as young as two have become a symbol for how entrenched the city is in violence. St Louis county, the suburbs which border the city, have also seen a high child murder rate with seven children shot dead. St Louis\u2019s mayor, Lyda Krewson, has offered $25,000 for information on four of the dead children\u2019s cases, a grand total of $100,000. The city is also planning to spend $500,000 on the lauded crime reduction program, Cure Violence, and another $1.5m on violence prevention efforts. The city also has programs to provide food, recreation and jobs to low-income people, as well as large-scale efforts to demolish derelict homes. This year, St Louis plans to tear down 700 homes, and has programs that allow people to purchase homes for $1. \u201cIt\u2019s a multipronged effort, but we all know this violence is a function of generational poverty and a lack of opportunity and it\u2019s something that St Louis is not immune to just like all these other cities,\u201d said Koran Addo, director of communications for the office of the mayor. Missouri\u2019s governor, Mike Parson, announced on 19 September that the state would deploy more police to the area and provide prosecutorial assistance. This plan of \u201ctargeting violent criminals and getting them off the street\u201d does not include any changes to the state\u2019s lax gun laws, which allow people to carry handguns and rifles without a permit. There is a deep distrust of police in the city and people in the affected neighborhoods said they can\u2019t see a way out of the problem without addressing the lack of jobs, neglected buildings and drug addiction. And because guns are so easily purchased illegally, there is little faith that strengthening the state\u2019s weak gun control laws would resolve the issue. \u201cMore young men have access to guns than wallets in their back pockets,\u201d said James Clark, vice-president of community outreach for the not-for-profit Better Family Life. \u201cThat\u2019s a major issue, but now, it\u2019s one thing to have a gun, it\u2019s another thing to be willing to pull that trigger.\u201d Clark said family and community structures in the city\u2019s impoverished neighborhoods have disintegrated so much that things have become more violent, fueled by a lack of hope and support. Better Family Life runs a gun violence de-escalation program, providing mediation in interpersonal conflicts that could result in gun violence, and a Clean Sweep program that works to demolish abandoned and blighted buildings that have overtaken the city\u2019s poorest neighborhoods. \u201cThe root cause of violence is poverty. It took us 10 years to all agree on that. It will take at least three generations to eradicate poverty, at least three, and that\u2019s if we started right now,\u201d Clark said. \u2018A nightmare that you can\u2019t get over\u2019 This constant stream of violence meant that when the first of the 13 children was gunned down this year, there were a few local news reports, then most of the city moved on. But as the numbers rose, with children getting caught in crossfire while playing outside their houses or killed inside their own homes, the anxiety grew. The first and youngest child to die this year in St Louis city was two-year-old Kayden Johnson. He and his mother, Trina\u2019ty Riley, were found dead in their home in May. Elijah Johnson, the father of the child, told KMOV4 that he was heartbroken after the shooting. \u201cJust a lot of pain, it was unbelievable,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI could not believe it.\u201d There have been no public developments in the case on who killed Kayden and his mother, nor has their been much progress in finding who is responsible for the other deaths. Only one of the cases have seen someone charged with homicide \u2013 the killing of Sentonio Cox, 15. Sentonio, who was retreating with his hands up when he was shot, according to court papers, was found with multiple gunshot wounds in a lot down the street from his home. He was the second of his mother\u2019s six children to be fatally shot. \u201cIt\u2019s like a nightmare that you can\u2019t get over, like a bottomless pit,\u201d Roxyzanna Edwards, his mother, told KSDK. Police have charged two men, aged 47 and 54, with Sentonio\u2019s murder. The same weekend Sentonio was killed, Nyla Banks, 10, and Jurnee Thompson, eight, were also fatally shot. No one has been charged in the deaths of the two young girls. Kim Gardner, the circuit attorney for the city of St Louis, said the city and state needed to take this systemic cycle of trauma into account to combat gun violence. \u201cWe can\u2019t arrest our way out of this, we can\u2019t prosecute our way out of this. We have to figure out why a person is picking up a gun and shooting into a crowd,\u201d she said. She is the first black female prosecutor in St Louis and has faced severe criticism while promoting progressive criminal justice reform. The state has prioritized policing in responding to gun violence, and directly challenged efforts to address poverty, such as when Missouri\u2019s government voted to lower the minimum wage from $10 to $7.90 an hour in 2017 (voters passed a law in November 2018 to increase it again). In the past decade, Missouri has also made it easier for people to obtain guns. In the state, anyone 19 or older can legally carry a concealed weapon without a concealed-carry permit or any training. These changes coincided with a 16% increase in homicides over a six-year period where the nationwide gun homicide rate decreased. Ferguson protests T-Dubb-O, a rapper and activist born and raised in the city, said he wishes people had another way to solve their problems than violence, but when he was shooting at people and being shot at as a teenager, it was often the only way to keep himself alive. The number of illegal weapons flooding the streets would not be changed much by stricter laws, said T-Dubbo-O, who said he doesn\u2019t leave the house without a gun. He, like others, also doesn\u2019t think it would address the underlying issues driving someone to use a gun to resolve a conflict. \u201cI can\u2019t say why somebody shouldn\u2019t do what they do if they feel hopelessness, I don\u2019t know their mental state or how to stop that, but what I do know is we can stop those conditions,\u201d he said. He does outreach with the group HandsUp United, a collective which provides food, technical classes and social justice education to the community. As a father of four, T-Dubb-O is also focused on keeping his children away from the chains of poverty. \u201cI don\u2019t care what I have to do,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if it means going back to selling drugs. I\u2019ll make sure I have life insurance, and if somebody kills me, then they\u2019ll have enough money to survive and go off to a nice college and I got a wonderful woman who will make sure they go at it in the correct way.\u201d T-Dubb-O and his partner, Rika Tyler, were part of the uprising in Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis which attracted international attention in August 2014 after a white police officer, Darren Wilson, fatally shot the unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown. Tyler lived five minutes away from where Brown was killed and went to the scene as the teenager\u2019s body lay in the street for four hours. She said the intense protests that followed were about more than just Brown: it was an expression of frustration with how the black community in St Louis, and across the US, encounters more policing, fewer job opportunities, worse health outcomes and lower-quality schools. \u201cIt was just the straw that broke the people\u2019s back,\u201d Tyler said. A long history of racial discrimination and segregation Missouri hosted one of the most prominent legal controversies about slavery when Dred Scott, enslaved at birth, fought slavery in the US supreme court. The court ruled in 1857 that Scott and other African Americans cannot be considered American citizens, setting up course for the civil war. In the early 1900s, just 50 years after slavery was abolished in the US, St Louis voted in favor of an ordinance that prevented someone from moving into a neighborhood if it was predominantly home to people of another race. Though the supreme court struck down the ordinance, city planners had families in certain neighborhoods sign documents saying they would never sell to an African American family. Housing discrimination was outlawed in 1968 but in practice segregation persists. Weaving between blocks in St Louis, and the suburbs that surround it in St Louis county, the racial and class divides are blatant. In the city\u2019s JeffVanderLou neighborhood, the life expectancy is 18 years lower than it is in the nearby wealthy, majority-white suburbof Clayton, according to a 2014 report. In Clayton, which is in St Louis county, 78% of residents are white and the median household income is $90,000, while in JeffVanderLou 95% are black and the median household income is $15,000. Drive about nine minutes from the city\u2019s ritzy Central West End and the clothing boutiques, artisanal ice-cream shops and cafes quickly give way to crumbled homes and emptied streets. Sex workers and people with drug addictions occupy the playgrounds and children are mostly kept indoors. Yolanda Whittier, a 29-year-old mother of two, said she could move out of a neighborhood where shootouts happen outside their front door, to one where you can only hear the sound of bullets, if she got a job that paid an extra $200-$250 a week. She was offered such a position, but couldn\u2019t take it after failing the required eye exam because she hasn\u2019t been able to afford glasses since losing her security guard job in May. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d be living like this,\u201d she said, as her five-year-old, Mark, and three-year-old, Kenzi, buzzed around her legs. When Whittier pulls back the heavy, dark curtains covering her living room windows, she sees one potential answer to some of the problems in her community. An unusually manicured lawn and newly built apartment building stand facing an old home that looks like it has been bombed. \u201cBetter buildings, better people,\u201d she said. \u2018Even if he killed my baby, he\u2019s still my baby\u2019 Seven-year-old Xavier\u2019s case is also one of the few to lead to an arrest. Malik Ross, 27, was arrested for theft and told police he shot Xavier accidentally after seeing men with a gun on a nearby porch. \u201cIt was them or me,\u201d he told police. He has not been charged with the murder. Xavier\u2019s grandmother, Mary Norwood, has lived in Ferguson for 12 years, a few blocks from where Brown was killed on West Florissant Avenue. She avoids driving down the busy thoroughfare because it still reminds her of the smoke, smell and noise from the weeks of protests. For 66 years, she has watched family and friends go to prison, struggle with addiction and drop dead. One nephew was fatally shot by police and Norwood was addicted to drugs and alcohol until 1993. A survivor of domestic abuse, she is now studying for her third master\u2019s degree. After Xavier was shot, Norwood took care of her youngest granddaughters, who witnessed the shooting, while their parents were at the hospital, inconsolable after his death. Norwood said the trio of kids \u201chad more energy than the law allows\u201d and were known in the neighborhood as the \u201cwelcoming committee\u201d because they would greet new neighbors and share what they learned with the rest of the neighborhood. \u201cHe was a spunky little boy, he was so outgoing.\u201d Norwood fears for the man responsible for Xavier\u2019s death. \u201cI am a mother of the race,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if he killed my baby, he\u2019s still my baby.\u201d She is worried that if the assailant goes to prison, he will be put on a path of more destruction and suffering. \u201cIf nothing came out of Xavier\u2019s death except the young man was able to look and see the error of his ways and that changed him in some kind of way, then Xavier\u2019s death wasn\u2019t in vain,\u201d Norwood said.",

      "bodyText": "A former English teacher is suing offshore detention operator Broadspectrum for \u201cdevastating\u201d ill health caused by black mould in her accomodation while she was on Nauru teaching asylum seekers and refugees. The case, which joins ongoing fallout from a years-long issue with dangerous mould at the offshore immigration detention centre in Nauru, went before the Queensland supreme court on Tuesday afternoon. In an affidavit filed to the court and seen by Guardian Australia, 68-year-old Dorothy McDonald said she was made to live in a room with \u201cblack, sticky and hairy\u201d mould and was denied requests to move elsewhere. She said the months of \u201csignificant\u201d exposure over a fly-in-fly-out work schedule had left her with debilitating health complaints including chronic fatigue, headaches and difficulties with concentration and memory. McDonald said she has been unable to work since returning from Nauru in November 2015. \u201cBeing an English teacher, I always prided myself on my ability to articulate my thoughts,\u201d she said. \u201cIt feels like an integral part of who I was has been taken from me and is now gone.\u201d According to the McDonald affidavit, she was employed by the Salvation Army and then Transfield \u2013 now known as Broadspectrum \u2013 between January 2013 and November 2015. McDonald said she spent about 18 months in demountable cabins and her complaint stemmed largely from two rooms she lived in for 11 months in 2015. After complaining of mould in one room, McDonald said she was moved to another which she said quickly became far worse. The previous room, which she had lived in for about six months, was closed permanently, she said. She said both rooms had only one permanently shut window, and she was made to keep the air conditioners set at 22C, a contrast which felt \u201clike a freezer\u201d compared with the 30C to 40C temperatures outside, she said. \u201cI recall seeing the condensation mix with the mould and slide down the wall, leaving a black streak on the wall,\u201d she said. She said she asked to move several times, but was told accommodation was at a premium and there was no other option. An accomodation officer told her to just wash the walls, she said. According to McDonald\u2019s affidavit, her symptoms worsened, including itchy eyes, fevers, disturbed sleep, headaches and sinusitis. Her symptoms improved during a brief trip to the UK, and on return trips to Australia, but she said they worsened each time she came back to Nauru, and expanded to include fatigue and a \u201csignificant change in my concentration and cognitive function\u201d. \u201cI had difficulty remembering words and names. I also had difficulty using the computer system,\u201d she said. In October 2015 she was hospitalised in Nauru with a respiratory infection and was flown to Australia, where she said she continues to suffer from chronic fatigue as well as concentration and memory problems. \u201cMy symptoms continue to be devastating,\u201d she said. \u201cMy life has changed irrevocably.

On Tuesday the case was adjourned amid disagreement over which jurisdiction applied. McDonald has asked the court to apply the laws of Nauru to her case as she was allegedly injured in Nauru. Broadspectrum claims NSW law applies. The case is the latest claim of dangerous exposure to mould at the immigration detention centre which Australia operated on Nauru. Last year the Department of Home Affairs said there had been \u201cno cases of anyone developing health issues following exposure to mould at the Nauru RPC\u201d, however Comcare has confirmed it received a complaint from a former employee in 2016, and a number of other former staff have also alleged their health was affected. A microbiologist contracted to assess the problem in 2014 said the problem was \u201c10 out of 10\u201d and \u201ccould not be any worse\u201d when he viewed it, and leaked emails last year cast doubt on government assurances that adequate action was being taken to combat the mould. Broadspectrum has previously said it maintained a healthy and safe workplace for its employees on Nauru. It has been contacted for comment on this current case.",

You\u2019ll be able to build a castle on your kitchen table, save it to memory, then view a lifesize version wherever you go \u2013 as long as there\u2019s enough space for a virtual building made from 1m blocks, which can be up to 64 blocks high. The game also places collectible Minecraft blocks and objects \u2013 known as tappables \u2013 around your own neighbourhood, so while out walking, you can look at the map screen, see that there\u2019s a treasure chest nearby, then tap on it to open it up and discover new resources to build with \u2013 perhaps a few planks of wood, some stone or a window.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"600d43a87807507ae95a847c23993ced4cd6611d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/600d43a87807507ae95a847c23993ced4cd6611d/0_586_1080_648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In Minecraft Earth, users can construct scale models on any flat surface; larger versions can then be placed in open areas for exploration and sharing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A test case for the future of AR as a gaming platform \u2026 Minecraft Earth.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Microsoft</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like the gigantically successful <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/pokemon-go\">Pok\u00e9mon Go</a>, however, there are also specific story events, tied to various locations, that players can discover and interact with. When Microsoft showed the game to a group of journalists in Cavendish Square Gardens, one of these Adventure tasks was marked on the Minecraft Earth maps on our phones \u2013 the moment we tapped on it, a lifesize stone building sprang up among the trees, and immediately skeleton soldiers began pouring out for us to attack with our swords and bows and arrows. When you defeat the onslaught, you get to scoop up all the treasure they leave behind. Although both the building and the skeletons are visible only as graphical objects on our phone screens, it\u2019s weird how quickly and completely you get sucked in, forgetting that the joggers doing laps of the square can\u2019t see the epic struggle taking place.</p> <p>The idea for Minecraft Earth came from an intriguing real-world project. In 2012, Mojang, the studio behind the Minecraft game, set up a charity named <a href=\"https://www.blockbyblock.org/\">Block By Block</a>, which allowed young people in developing countries to design new areas for their communities using the game. Working with <a href=\"https://www.un.org/ruleoflaw/un-and-the-rule-of-law/united-nations-human-settlements-programme/\">the United Nations </a><a href=\"https://www.un.org/ruleoflaw/un-and-the-rule-of-law/united-nations-human-settlements-programme/\">human </a><a href=\"https://www.un.org/ruleoflaw/un-and-the-rule-of-law/united-nations-human-settlements-programme/\">settlements </a><a href=\"https://www.un.org/ruleoflaw/un-and-the-rule-of-law/united-nations-human-settlements-programme/\">programme</a>, these models and ideas could then be voted on and put into action, revitalising neglected or dangerous urban spaces.</p> <p>\u201cWe thought, what if everyone could try this?\u201d says game director Torfi Olafsson. \u201cWe found out there was research going on in the Microsoft cognition group, which works on the Hololens unit, which would allow us to place things with precision in physical space \u2013 that\u2019s the technology Adventures use.\u201d</p> <p>Minecraft Earth employs Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud computing infrastructure to host and maintain the world, and Azure spatial anchors to place the persistent Adventure tasks in real-world locations. Each of these adventures is hosted on a single dedicated instance on the server, so everyone who sees an Adventure in a certain place can join in with other players and defeat enemies together. At the moment, the number of players able to join an instance is hard coded to a maximum of 40. \u201cBut it\u2019s flexible,\u201d says Olafsson. \u201cIt\u2019s not a technical issue. It\u2019s more about comfort and personal space.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b6a046d122aa1410808c2b125c3f1d0d5202f353\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6a046d122aa1410808c2b125c3f1d0d5202f353/0_1086_1125_674/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Minecraft chicken in London ...

Minecraft Earth.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Keith Stuart/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The game also employs the collaborative mapping software <a href=\"https://www.openstreetmap.org/\">OpenStreetMap</a> to place tappables in the world, using a proprietary algorithm that selects suitable areas based on safety and space concerns. \u201cOur algorithms will never choose an area that doesn\u2019t grant enough space for you to manoeuvre within and around the adventure, and we\u2019ll also allow players to feedback if they don\u2019t think an adventure is well-placed,\u201d says Olafsson. \u201cOpenStreetMap is a fantastic resource, an incredibly detailed map of the entire world complete with tagging. You can see if a particular space is a cemetery, a public park or even a military installation.\u201d</p> <p>Because the tags are generated by users, however, interesting errors can sometimes arise. \u201cWe had an issue with placing tappables in a particular neighbourhood of London,\u201d says Olafsson. \u201cWe discovered that someone had tagged an upcoming extension of the underground as an overground train so our algorithm believed that there was a massive train line running through the area and excluded that neighbourhood completely.\u201d</p> <p>He also says that some of the OpenStreetMap tags highlight locations that are unsafe \u2013 or just unsavoury. \u201cIt\u2019ll give you information about areas that are not so nice, like really shady clubs. We use these tags to generate a blacklist of where not to place items, but it\u2019s often very interesting \u2013 especially if you were building a sort of augmented reality <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/grand-theft-auto\">Grand Theft Auto</a> game!\u201d</p> <p>Minecraft Earth has been in a prototyping phase for 18 months, and, over the last few weeks, a limited closed beta has taken place in key cities around the world \u2013 which has revealed some interesting issues. Players in Japan, for example, started to ride bullet trains so they could hoover up tappable objects much more quickly than just walking around their cities. \u201cThey were progressing too fast and it broke the system,\u201d laughs Olafsson. \u201cWe had to install a speed limit on collecting in-game items.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzCBCoC2bjs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tzCBCoC2bjs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The game was pirated during the beta and quickly distributed on Android devices. \u201cOvernight we were seeing people in South Africa, in small villages in Siberia, all across Asia, a huge player base in South America,\u201d says Olafsson. \u201cIt was shocking to wake up in the morning, look at the data and see that the game had accidentally gone global. We can\u2019t condone piracy, but it definitely validated our use of OpenStreetMap data to generate content. A random person in Papua New Guinea was able to take their phone out and collect tappables because the algorithm had made content.\u201d</p> <p>When the game enters open early access later this month, anyone in the supported territories (which Microsoft has not yet confirmed) will be able to download and play it while the team continues to iterate and improve the code. At the start, it\u2019ll be possible to build and share only quite simple structures, although from the outset, you\u2019ll be able to invite nearby players to collaborate on your projects. Later, Microsoft plans to define special areas in open public spaces where users will be able to showcase particularly impressive builds. Soon, perhaps, every park will have its own AR sculpture gallery.</p> <p>Considering the huge success of the Minecraft brand, which just reached 176 million players, as well as the continuing popularity of Pok\u00e9mon Go, and the fascinated looks we drew from other people in Cavendish Square Gardens, Minecraft Earth is going to be extremely popular. It will be interesting to see how stable the experience is with hundreds of thousands of people playing, and whether the development team is able to evolve the game overtime to keep people involved. </p> <p>We have also yet to see exactly how Microsoft will monetise the game. It\u2019s free to play, and to collect items, but there will be in-app purchases, perhaps providing quicker access to desirable rare blocks through payment options. Whatever the case, as a marker for the future of AR as a gaming platform, Minecraft Earth has fascinating ramifications.</p>",

Like the gigantically successful Pok\u00e9mon Go, however, there are also specific story events, tied to various locations, that players can discover and interact with. When Microsoft showed the game to a group of journalists in Cavendish Square Gardens, one of these Adventure tasks was marked on the Minecraft Earth maps on our phones \u2013 the moment we tapped on it, a lifesize stone building sprang up among the trees, and immediately skeleton soldiers began pouring out for us to attack with our swords and bows and arrows. When you defeat the onslaught, you get to scoop up all the treasure they leave behind. Although both the building and the skeletons are visible only as graphical objects on our phone screens, it\u2019s weird how quickly and completely you get sucked in, forgetting that the joggers doing laps of the square can\u2019t see the epic struggle taking place. The idea for Minecraft Earth came from an intriguing real-world project. In 2012, Mojang, the studio behind the Minecraft game, set up a charity named Block By Block, which allowed young people in developing countries to design new areas for their communities using the game. Working with the United Nations human settlements programme, these models and ideas could then be voted on and put into action, revitalising neglected or dangerous urban spaces. \u201cWe thought, what if everyone could try this?\u201d says game director Torfi Olafsson. \u201cWe found out there was research going on in the Microsoft cognition group, which works on the Hololens unit, which would allow us to place things with precision in physical space \u2013 that\u2019s the technology Adventures use.\u201d Minecraft Earth employs Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud computing infrastructure to host and maintain the world, and Azure spatial anchors to place the persistent Adventure tasks in real-world locations. Each of these adventures is hosted on a single dedicated instance on the server, so everyone who sees an Adventure in a certain place can join in with other players and defeat enemies together. At the moment, the number of players able to join an instance is hard coded to a maximum of 40. \u201cBut it\u2019s flexible,\u201d says Olafsson. \u201cIt\u2019s not a technical issue. It\u2019s more about comfort and personal space.\u201d The game also employs the collaborative mapping software OpenStreetMap to place tappables in the world, using a proprietary algorithm that selects suitable areas based on safety and space concerns. \u201cOur algorithms will never choose an area that doesn\u2019t grant enough space for you to manoeuvre within and around the adventure, and we\u2019ll also allow players to feedback if they don\u2019t think an adventure is well-placed,\u201d says Olafsson. \u201cOpenStreetMap is a fantastic resource, an incredibly detailed map of the entire world complete with tagging. You can see if a particular space is a cemetery, a public park or even a military installation.\u201d Because the tags are generated by users, however, interesting errors can sometimes arise. \u201cWe had an issue with placing tappables in a particular neighbourhood of London,\u201d says Olafsson. \u201cWe discovered that someone had tagged an upcoming extension of the underground as an overground train so our algorithm believed that there was a massive train line running through the area and excluded that neighbourhood completely.\u201d He also says that some of the OpenStreetMap tags highlight locations that are unsafe \u2013 or just unsavoury. \u201cIt\u2019ll give you information about areas that are not so nice, like really shady clubs. We use these tags to generate a blacklist of where not to place items, but it\u2019s often very interesting \u2013 especially if you were building a sort of augmented reality Grand Theft Auto game!\u201d Minecraft Earth has been in a prototyping phase for 18 months, and, over the last few weeks, a limited closed beta has taken place in key cities around the world \u2013 which has revealed some interesting issues. Players in Japan, for example, started to ride bullet trains so they could hoover up tappable objects much more quickly than just walking around their cities. \u201cThey were progressing too fast and it broke the system,\u201d laughs Olafsson. \u201cWe had to install a speed limit on collecting in-game items.\u201d The game was pirated during the beta and quickly distributed on Android devices. \u201cOvernight we were seeing people in South Africa, in small villages in Siberia, all across Asia, a huge player base in South America,\u201d says Olafsson. \u201cIt was shocking to wake up in the morning, look at the data and see that the game had accidentally gone global. We can\u2019t condone piracy, but it definitely validated our use of OpenStreetMap data to generate content. A random person in Papua New Guinea was able to take their phone out and collect tappables because the algorithm had made content.\u201d When the game enters open early access later this month, anyone in the supported territories (which Microsoft has not yet confirmed) will be able to download and play it while the team continues to iterate and improve the code. At the start, it\u2019ll be possible to build and share only quite simple structures, although from the outset, you\u2019ll be able to invite nearby players to collaborate on your projects. Later, Microsoft plans to define special areas in open public spaces where users will be able to showcase particularly impressive builds. Soon, perhaps, every park will have its own AR sculpture gallery. Considering the huge success of the Minecraft brand, which just reached 176 million players, as well as the continuing popularity of Pok\u00e9mon Go, and the fascinated looks we drew from other people in Cavendish Square Gardens, Minecraft Earth is going to be extremely popular. It will be interesting to see how stable the experience is with hundreds of thousands of people playing, and whether the development team is able to evolve the game overtime to keep people involved. We have also yet to see exactly how Microsoft will monetise the game. It\u2019s free to play, and to collect items, but there will be in-app purchases, perhaps providing quicker access to desirable rare blocks through payment options. Whatever the case, as a marker for the future of AR as a gaming platform, Minecraft Earth has fascinating ramifications.",

That said: say the Kanye Interruption worked as intended, and the best video award was handed out to Beyonc\u00e9 on the night \u2026 how would that spin her particular ensuing career axis? Maybe she would have stuck to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/oct/24/beyonce-sasha-fierce\">Sasha Fierce</a> alter ego, running it into the ground in an effort to further cement that MTV endorsement, zigging away from the artistic groundwork of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/23/beyonce-4-album-review\">4</a> that led to the darker, stormier <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1JPKLa-Ofc\">Drunk in Love</a> era, and instead she just kept turning up to red-carpet parties with that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4m1EFMoRFvY\">Single Ladies</a> robot glove on, glimmering in the background of paparazzi shots as other MTV VMA 2009 era celebrities \u2013 like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/01/3oh3-live-review\">3OH!3</a>, maybe, remember them? \u2013 become Beyonc\u00e9-famous instead.

Someone check please) (Just thinking about how exhausting it would be to be Kanye\u2019s mate. Have decided since the last brackets: Kanye doesn\u2019t have mates) would sit him down in a quiet room and tell him: \u201cKanye, though aesthetically this is your greatest ever era, and last year\u2019s 808s is your most underrated album, you probably need to not get up on stage during Taylor Swift\u2019s acceptance speech and start yelling about Beyonc\u00e9; come on buddy, let\u2019s get you to some nice cosy talking therapy.\u201d Ultimately, the only thing different about a timeline where Kanye West addresses his demons in 2009 rather than post-Kim is we do not have the album Ye, and I think we can all agree that\u2019s no great net loss.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"46b0ee95f242481b668b4dd82d44764742937d91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46b0ee95f242481b668b4dd82d44764742937d91/188_45_510_1123/454.jpg\" alt=\"Hennessy Cognac\" width=\"454\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hennessy Cognac.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Taylor goes off-piste</h2> <p>If there\u2019s one thing Taylor Swift is known for, it\u2019s for being an almost painfully wholesome presence in the pop world, sort of like if a BuzzFeed five-ingredient brownie recipe came to life and started doing stadium tour choreography. In the 10 years since The Kanye Incident, she has behaved with nothing but distant grace and beef-free decorum in relation to it and the ensuing remembrances (see: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/aug/24/taylor-swift-pop-music-hunger-games-gladiators\">Kim Kardashian beef</a>, circa 2016). But what if that\u2019s all Kanye\u2019s doing? Think about it: is it not possible that, 10 years ago, Kanye West handed Taylor, on stage, a sort of bulletproof moral high ground, and it\u2019s been the handbrake on any bad behaviour ever since. She cannot possibly rebel because if she does that she will \u201cKanye\u201d herself, and therefore lose. As Taylor (now) approaches the age of Kanye (then), she is nowhere near getting ungraciously drunk on Hennessy and interrupting someone else\u2019s awards speech. Without a Kanye-shaped villain for Taylor to be the golden light in contrast to, alt-universe Taylor is currently in her OxyContin phase and flirting with a face tattoo, simply because there\u2019s no one to prove wrong by not doing it.</p>",

Beyonc\u00e9 never happens Hardest one to justify, this: something about Beyonc\u00e9, her sheer Beyonc\u00e9ness, suggests that, on every alt-timeline, she is still Beyonc\u00e9; Beyonc\u00e9 cannot escape her destin\u00e9, Beyonc\u00e9 is Beyonc\u00e9 in every simulation run of the planet, the only constant, more enduring than the sun. That said: say the Kanye Interruption worked as intended, and the best video award was handed out to Beyonc\u00e9 on the night \u2026 how would that spin her particular ensuing career axis? Maybe she would have stuck to the Sasha Fierce alter ego, running it into the ground in an effort to further cement that MTV endorsement, zigging away from the artistic groundwork of 4 that led to the darker, stormier Drunk in Love era, and instead she just kept turning up to red-carpet parties with that Single Ladies robot glove on, glimmering in the background of paparazzi shots as other MTV VMA 2009 era celebrities \u2013 like 3OH!3, maybe, remember them? \u2013 become Beyonc\u00e9-famous instead. Imagine 3OH!3\u2019s Lemonade. Thank the dark and mysterious ancient powers that bore you on to this earth, and not the one that had that. Kanye is subject to a rigorous intervention from his friends Fair to say Kanye\u2019s interruption in 2009 was \u201cvery cognac-inspired\u201d and, in a just and right world, his mates (does Kanye have mates? Someone check please) (Just thinking about how exhausting it would be to be Kanye\u2019s mate. Have decided since the last brackets: Kanye doesn\u2019t have mates) would sit him down in a quiet room and tell him: \u201cKanye, though aesthetically this is your greatest ever era, and last year\u2019s 808s is your most underrated album, you probably need to not get up on stage during Taylor Swift\u2019s acceptance speech and start yelling about Beyonc\u00e9; come on buddy, let\u2019s get you to some nice cosy talking therapy.\u201d Ultimately, the only thing different about a timeline where Kanye West addresses his demons in 2009 rather than post-Kim is we do not have the album Ye, and I think we can all agree that\u2019s no great net loss. Taylor goes off-piste If there\u2019s one thing Taylor Swift is known for, it\u2019s for being an almost painfully wholesome presence in the pop world, sort of like if a BuzzFeed five-ingredient brownie recipe came to life and started doing stadium tour choreography. In the 10 years since The Kanye Incident, she has behaved with nothing but distant grace and beef-free decorum in relation to it and the ensuing remembrances (see: Kim Kardashian beef, circa 2016). But what if that\u2019s all Kanye\u2019s doing? Think about it: is it not possible that, 10 years ago, Kanye West handed Taylor, on stage, a sort of bulletproof moral high ground, and it\u2019s been the handbrake on any bad behaviour ever since. She cannot possibly rebel because if she does that she will \u201cKanye\u201d herself, and therefore lose. As Taylor (now) approaches the age of Kanye (then), she is nowhere near getting ungraciously drunk on Hennessy and interrupting someone else\u2019s awards speech. Without a Kanye-shaped villain for Taylor to be the golden light in contrast to, alt-universe Taylor is currently in her OxyContin phase and flirting with a face tattoo, simply because there\u2019s no one to prove wrong by not doing it.",

It is out of this world \u2013 and in it. It is mythical and realistic, ancient and modern and was originally commissioned to accompany a series of watercolours by William Tillyer (it has been rewritten to be a more \u201cmobile\u201d version). In a foreword, Oswald relates the contrasting stories from <em>The Odyssey</em> that inspired it. In one, Agamemnon pays a poet to spy on his wife and the poet is then banished to a stony island which allows for the seduction of the wife (Agamemnon is murdered 10 years later). In the other, Odysseus\u2019s return, after a decade away, is luckier \u2013 his faithful wife is waiting for him. The poem exists, Oswald maintains in a foreword, in the \u201cmurky\u201d region between these outcomes: \u201cIts voice is wind-blown, water-damaged, as if someone set out to sing <em>The Odyssey</em> but was rowed to a stony island and never discovered the poem\u2019s ending.\u201d In Oswald\u2019s hands, the poet on his island is at once trapped and free (is this a fair description of what it is to be a poet?).

      "body": "<p>Vontaze Burfict has long been considered the NFL\u2019s dirtiest player. And not in a misinformed, yearning for the good ol\u2019 days, don\u2019t-we-all-sneakily-enjoy-it way. His play is not tough but fair \u2013 it is vicious and violent. He does not look merely to tackle opponents, he often appears to be seeking to harm them too. So it\u2019s little surprise that the 29-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/30/nfl-bans-oakland-raiders-vontaze-burfict-jack-doyle-late-hit\">has been suspended for the remainder of the 2019 season</a>, after <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FootbaIl_Tweets/status/1178370464227315712\">he delivered a barbaric head-to-head shot</a> to Indianapolis Colts tight end Jack Doyle on Sunday.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FootbaIl_Tweets/status/1178370464227315712\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Raiders LB Vontaze Burfict has been ejected for this hit \ud83e\udd10 <a href=\"https://t.co/Gdx4xMp3Uf\">pic.twitter.com/Gdx4xMp3Uf</a></p>&mdash; Football Is Life (@FootbaIl_Tweets) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FootbaIl_Tweets/status/1178370464227315712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 29, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Burfict\u2019s suspension will likely be reduced on appeal, as was the case with his five-game ban in 2017, which was later reduced to three. But this is more about messaging than the particulars of the ban. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jul/25/concussion-study-nfl-cte-college-players\">the link between football and brain trauma grows</a>, the NFL is trying to crack down on head injuries. Punishing him heavily is an easy, fan-friendly decision. But it\u2019s also one that sends a strong message to every other locker-room: in the modern game, this type of violence not be tolerated.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/30/nfl-bans-oakland-raiders-vontaze-burfict-jack-doyle-late-hit\">NFL bans Raiders' Vontaze Burfict for rest of season after brutal hit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere were no mitigating circumstances on this play,\u201d Joe Runyan, the NFL\u2019s vice president of football operations said in a letter to Burfict. \u201cYour contact was unnecessary, flagrant and should have been avoided. For your actions, you were penalized and disqualified from the game.\u201d The criticism escalated. \u201cYou have continued to flagrantly abuse rules designated to protect yourself and your opponents from unnecessary risk,\u201d Runyan wrote. Never has the league office offered such a forceful rebuke of a player\u2019s on-field conduct. The NFL edged as close to publicly labeling Burfict a pariah as a corporation can possibly do while reprimanding a unionized employee.</p> <p>During his time in the NFL, Burfict has missed a total of 22 games due to suspension, roughly 19% of his career. In monetary terms, he\u2019s cost himself $4.6m in salary and has been fined nine other times, costing $411,000. That\u2019s over $5m of his career earnings washed away by reckless play.</p> <p>Burfict\u2019s troubling pattern of behavior stretches back to high school. He was the top high-school recruit at his position in the country. Recruiting site 247 Sports listed Burfict as the 11th best prospect in the country and one of the 250 best prospects in the history of high school football; he still ranks as the 39<sup>th</sup> best player to ever come out of the talent-rich state of California. But Burfict received few elite-level college scholarship offers, and he ended up at Arizona State, a third-rate program. The best of the best had heard all about Burfict\u2019s reputation: he had serious anger issues, the story went. One by one they chose to pass.</p> <p>In football, passing up on a linebacker because he has anger issues is like passing on The Beatles because their music is too catchy. Linebackers are the tone setters in a brutish, collision-based sport. Find a linebacker with anger problems and you\u2019ll see a trail of 40 coaches scuttling behind, certain in their belief that they\u2019re the ones who can help channel that violence into controlled aggression.</p> <p>That wasn\u2019t the case with Burfict. He had obvious first-round potential in the NFL draft, and teams loved his athleticism, instincts and tenacity. Yet he went undrafted. High school whispers had become facts in college, and <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/draft/story/09000d5d82895e07/article/vontaze-burfict-jayron-hosley-fail-drug-test-before-nfl-draft\">he failed a drug test at the NFL combine</a>.

      "bodyText": "Vontaze Burfict has long been considered the NFL\u2019s dirtiest player. And not in a misinformed, yearning for the good ol\u2019 days, don\u2019t-we-all-sneakily-enjoy-it way. His play is not tough but fair \u2013 it is vicious and violent. He does not look merely to tackle opponents, he often appears to be seeking to harm them too. So it\u2019s little surprise that the 29-year-old has been suspended for the remainder of the 2019 season, after he delivered a barbaric head-to-head shot to Indianapolis Colts tight end Jack Doyle on Sunday. Burfict\u2019s suspension will likely be reduced on appeal, as was the case with his five-game ban in 2017, which was later reduced to three. But this is more about messaging than the particulars of the ban. As the link between football and brain trauma grows, the NFL is trying to crack down on head injuries. Punishing him heavily is an easy, fan-friendly decision. But it\u2019s also one that sends a strong message to every other locker-room: in the modern game, this type of violence not be tolerated. \u201cThere were no mitigating circumstances on this play,\u201d Joe Runyan, the NFL\u2019s vice president of football operations said in a letter to Burfict. \u201cYour contact was unnecessary, flagrant and should have been avoided. For your actions, you were penalized and disqualified from the game.\u201d The criticism escalated. \u201cYou have continued to flagrantly abuse rules designated to protect yourself and your opponents from unnecessary risk,\u201d Runyan wrote. Never has the league office offered such a forceful rebuke of a player\u2019s on-field conduct. The NFL edged as close to publicly labeling Burfict a pariah as a corporation can possibly do while reprimanding a unionized employee. During his time in the NFL, Burfict has missed a total of 22 games due to suspension, roughly 19% of his career. In monetary terms, he\u2019s cost himself $4.6m in salary and has been fined nine other times, costing $411,000. That\u2019s over $5m of his career earnings washed away by reckless play. Burfict\u2019s troubling pattern of behavior stretches back to high school. He was the top high-school recruit at his position in the country. Recruiting site 247 Sports listed Burfict as the 11th best prospect in the country and one of the 250 best prospects in the history of high school football; he still ranks as the 39th best player to ever come out of the talent-rich state of California. But Burfict received few elite-level college scholarship offers, and he ended up at Arizona State, a third-rate program. The best of the best had heard all about Burfict\u2019s reputation: he had serious anger issues, the story went. One by one they chose to pass. In football, passing up on a linebacker because he has anger issues is like passing on The Beatles because their music is too catchy. Linebackers are the tone setters in a brutish, collision-based sport. Find a linebacker with anger problems and you\u2019ll see a trail of 40 coaches scuttling behind, certain in their belief that they\u2019re the ones who can help channel that violence into controlled aggression. That wasn\u2019t the case with Burfict. He had obvious first-round potential in the NFL draft, and teams loved his athleticism, instincts and tenacity. Yet he went undrafted. High school whispers had become facts in college, and he failed a drug test at the NFL combine. Executives and coaches across the league didn\u2019t want to take the risk on a player with so many red flags. Those worries were realized once he signed as an undrafted free agent in Cincinnati. His years with the Bengals were marred by spells on the sidelines as suspensions and fines stacked up. The list speaks for itself: - September 2013: Fined $10,000 for striking an opponent in the groin and an additional $21,000 for a hit on a defenseless receiver in the same game. - October 2013: Fined $21,000 for spearing a receiver. - October 2014: Fined $25,000 for twisting the ankles of Panthers quarterback Cam Newton and tight end Greg Olson. - December 2015: Fined $69,000 for two unnecessary roughness penalties and diving at Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger\u2019s knee. - January 2016: Fined $50,000 for hitting a defenseless receiver on the chin. - January 2016: Suspended three games and forfeits $500,000 in salary for a headshot on defenseless wide receiver Antonio Brown. - October 2016: Fined $75,000 for stepping on Patriots running back LeGarrette Blount. - November 2016: Fined $12,000 for giving the middle finger to Bills fans. - August 2017: Suspended three games \u2013 reduced from five \u2013 for a hit on a defenseless player. - October 2017: Fined $12,000 for kicking an opponent. - March 2018: Suspended four games for violating the NFL\u2019s substance abuse policy. - October 2018: Fined $112,000 for multiple examples of unnecessary roughness in a game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. No other player in the league has that kind of rap sheet. The Bengals finally had enough at the end of last season, and Oakland\u2019s so-called brain-trust snapped him up, handing out a fat free-agent contract and making him a team captain. Adding Burfict to a locker-room that included Antonio Brown and Richie Incognito, men with their own troubled histories, was supposed to spur the Raiders back to their glory days, to encourage a ferocious, old-school playing style.

Australian Women Against Violence Alliance and Fair Agenda have partnered for a campaign aimed at government leaders, their shadow counterparts and the crossbench, calling for the Hanson-led family court inquiry to be dropped. The email campaign aims to encourage MPs to push the government into implementing the recommendations put forward by the Australian Law Reform Commission, which have sat with the government since April, and address many of the procedural complaints raised about the family court process. In announcing the inquiry, to be chaired by the conservative MP Kevin Andrews and the One Nation leader, Pauline Hanson, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said the inquiry would not be \u201ctaking sides\u201d. Hanson has repeatedly claimed, without evidence, that women are routinely making up domestic violence allegations in order to win custody. But the chief executive officer of Women\u2019s Safety NSW, Hayley Foster, said many women felt as though the inquiry had already taken a side, given Hanson\u2019s repeated comments and leadership role, and were questioning both its legitimacy and their safety in giving testimony. \u201cThe government already has substantive evidence and recommendations before it on how to reform the family law system,\u201d Foster said. \u201cNot one agency concerned with the welfare of women and children experiencing family violence and abuse have come out to support this inquiry.

Foster said the government already had enough to work with in order to reform the court, and the email campaign was designed to remind MPs of the real issues. The CEO of the Womens\u2019 Legal Service Queensland, Angela Lynch, said while the WLSQ was not part of the email campaign, it was also advocating for the government to act on the recommendations it had in front of it. \u201cThe ALRC just conducted the most extensive review of the family law system with 60 recommendations contained in a report delivered in March 2019,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was a previous lower house Henderson parliamentary report in 2017 with 30 to 35 recommendations that have not been acted upon.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s accounting watchdog has begun an investigation into EY\u2019s audit of Thomas Cook\u2019s accounts, just over a week after the world\u2019s oldest travel firm collapsed. The Financial Reporting Council said its enforcement division was investigating EY\u2019s audit of the financial statements of Thomas Cook for the year to 30 September 2018. \u201cThe FRC will keep under close review both the scope of this investigation and the question of whether to open any other investigation in relation to Thomas Cook, liaising with other relevant regulators to the fullest extent permissible,\u201d it said. EY took over from PwC as Thomas Cook\u2019s auditors in 2017. Both are among the UK\u2019s big four accountancy firms. Five months before its collapse, Thomas Cook reported a \u00a31.5bn first-half loss in May and issued its third profit warning in less than a year. In that set of accounts, EY warned there was \u201csignificant doubt\u201d whether Thomas Cook could continue as a going concern. On Monday, the FRC said it had issued a revised going concern standard following a spate of corporate failures in which auditors failed to flag up concerns about the company\u2019s viability. The collapsed tour operator had three different finance chiefs in two years as its financial problems deepened, and has faced questions about its accounting methods. Sten Daugaard became Thomas Cook\u2019s chief financial officer in December 2018 after Bill Scott quit after less than a year in the job following a profit warning. Scott had replaced Michael Healy in January 2018 when Healy stepped down after five years in the job. Daugaard changed the way Thomas Cook reported its accounts to include items that had been treated as exceptional costs for several years, including when paying directors and meeting banking covenants.

      "bodyText": "An independent commission should set the rate of Newstart to end the politicisation of welfare payment rates in Australia, according to a broad group of social service organisations, health groups and charities. As the Coalition ducks calls to lift the payment by $75 a week, more than a dozen organisations told a Senate inquiry into Newstart that the government should be forced to confront expert advice on the historically low rates of income support. Calling for an increase to the payment in their submission, groups including Uniting Communities, the Combined Pensioners and Superannuants Association and the Consumers Health Forum said a social security commission should help set the rate of welfare payments including Newstart to avoid a repeat of the 25-year \u201cfreeze\u201d of the unemployment payment. The commission would determine an acceptable standing of living for people on Newstart and then determine rates of payment and indexation, the groups said in separate submissions. Some organisations said the commission should provide advice to the government, while others called for an authority like the Fair Work Commission that would set welfare payment rates free from from political interference. The current system, which saw the government provide a small increase to the age pension through changes to deeming rates this year, was described by one advocate for an independent commission, the Queensland Council of Social Service, as \u201cmostly a political process\u201d. Another, Anglicare, told the inquiry: \u201cTwenty years of inaction is more than enough to show that the existing system of relying on governments to regularly review social security payments and ensure that they keep pace with the cost of living has failed\u201d. Newstart, which is paid to about 700,000 people each fortnight, is currently $279.50 for a single person. It has been effectively frozen since the mid-1990s after it was benchmarked to the consumer price index by the Howard government. At the same time, the Coalition tied pensions to wages, a decision that has seen the gap between the two payments widen significantly over time. Most welfare payments increase against these measures twice a year, although the former Labor government gave the age pension a one-off real terms increase in 2009 following a review. Labor proposed a similar inquiry into Newstart before the last election, but has since said it supports an increase to the payment without a review. Good Shepherd Australia, a women\u2019s advocacy organisation, said in its submission that parliament should consider adopting the model used in Scotland, where an independent authority monitors the government\u2019s performance against a social security charter. The former independent MP Cathy McGowan last year produced a bill for a social security commission after she backed calls from the Australian Council of Social Service. Submissions also addressed the impact of the low payment on Newstart recipients. In one submission, the Australian Association of Social Workers said that its members working in oncology wards had reported instances of people \u201cgoing without medication and refusing treatment because they cannot afford transport to the clinic\u201d. The Consumers Health Forum, meanwhile, said Newstart recipients had reported choosing between tampons and food and saving money by avoiding taking medication, particularly for mental health conditions. Another submission from the charity Uniting Communities said that clients in communities where bulk billing clinics were not available would avoid going to the doctors to get their scripts filled. Noting that people over 55 were now the largest cohort of people on Newstart, Good Shepherd also said its financial counsellors had seen an \u201can alarming increase in older people who are seeking help\u201d. The Senate inquiry into the rate of Newstart and related payments such as youth allowance was established as part of a push from Labor, the Greens and members of the crossbench to pressure the Morrison government into lifting the rate. It will hold public hearings next week. The Australian Council of Social Service calls for a $75 a week increase, which would cost the budget about $3.3bn a year.

      "bodyText": "Thanks for joining us, we are going to leave our live coverage here. Just to recap the main points: The Reserve Bank has made its third reduction in the cash rate in five months. It takes the benchmark borrowing rate in Australia to yet another record low of 0.75%. Governor Philip Lowe said the economy was at a turning point but the prospect of slower jobs growth and low inflation convinced him of the need to act; The Aussie dollar dipped 0.4% to US67.22c; Some economists were predicting further rate cuts this year; Comparison website Mozo said it will put more pressure on the big banks to pass on the cut to mortgage holders; Labor\u2019s Jim Chalmers has criticised the Coalition\u2019s economic management, as did the Greens The government has tried to put a positive spin on the rate cut with Josh Frydenberg saying that the RBA has pointed to \u201ca gentle turning point in the domestic economy\u201d and also urged the banks to pass on the rate cut There has been radio silence from the big four banks. Usually by about this time of the day after a rate cut, one of the big players would have broken ranks to announce their new rates. The banks are under enormous political pressure to pass on the full 25 basis points, but analysts have predicted Westpac, NAB and Australia\u2019s biggest bank, the Commonwealth, will keep some of it for themselves. The cut comes despite a 0.9% jump in house prices in September The share market has enjoyed its best day in nearly a month with the S&amp;P/ASX200 index up 54.5 points, or 0.81%, to 6,742.8 points A quick update on the Australian share market and the dollar via our friends at Australian Associated Press: The Australian share market has enjoyed its best day in nearly a month following the Reserve Bank\u2019s decision to cut the cash rate for a third time this year. The S&amp;P/ASX200 index on Tuesday finished up 54.5 points, or 0.81 per cent, to 6,742.8 points, while the broader All Ordinaries rose 52.4 points, or 0.77 per cent, to 6,853 points CMC Markets chief market strategist Michael McCarthy said that Tuesday\u2019s session had a lacklustre start but then buyers moved off the sidelines once the RBA cut rates mid-afternoon, sending the ASX up 50 points. \u201cA very strong performance, largely built around that rate cut,\u201d he said. Volumes were 10 per cent above average and the market finished at its highs of the day, indicating there could be more gains to come on Wednesday, Mr McCarthy said. The ASX200 is only 2% off the record all-time highs it set in late July. The Aussie dollar meanwhile dipped to a four-week low against its US counterpart, and was close to a 10-and-a-half year low. It was buying 67.02 US cents, from 67.54 US cents on Monday. Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive, James Pearson, has urged lenders to pass on the rate cut to \u201censure the greatest benefit is gained\u201d by households. He said: \u201cAlthough we are still to see the full impact of the earlier reductions in the cash rate and personal tax cuts, we believe the timing is right to boost parts of the economy that continue to struggle. \u201cWith slowing economic growth and lower consumer confidence, small businesses have been doing it tough over the past year. This has particularly affected discretionary spending in small retail businesses, including cafes and restaurants.\u201d \u201cWeakness in the housing sector has also been a significant drag on the economy over the past year, which has flowed through to consumer confidence and household spending.\u201d \u201cHowever, there are signs the housing sector has turned the corner recently, with a modest improvement in Sydney and Melbourne house prices. The lower interest rates will help the housing sector to rebuild momentum.\u201d Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has responded to the rate cut by accentuating the positive - that the RBA has pointed to \u201ca gentle turning point in the domestic economy\u201d. He said the RBA had noticed the \u201cpositive benefits that have been gained by the economy from the interest rate cuts, from the tax cuts, from extra spending on infrastructure from the stabilisation of the housing market and for the uptick in mining investment\u201d. Frydenberg flew right past all the RBA comments on low wages growth, suggesting that the \u201csignificant challenges\u201d the economy faces are \u201cinternationally with the global trade tensions between China and the US but they are also domestically, particularly with the punishing impact of the drought and floods\u201d. And of course no rate cut announcement would be complete without putting the hard word on lenders to pass it on: It is the government\u2019s expectation that the banks will pass on this 25 basis point rate cut in full. What this means for an Australian family with a mortgage of $400,000 is $720 less a year in interest payments. That\u2019s a significant benefit to an Australian family. It is completely reckless for the Labor Party to be talking down the Australian economy.\u201d Asked why the government isn\u2019t spending more money to stimulate the economy and how many rate cuts it will take before it will get involved, Frydenberg continued to point to existing policies including the 10-year $100bn infrastructure package. He even claimed that \u201cthe Labor Party opposed our tax cuts which are now delivering billions of dollars into the pockets of hard-working Australians\u201d despite Labor voting for the tax cuts in the parliament. Asked if the government is concerned the cuts will lead to house price rises, Frydenberg responded: We have welcomed the stabilisation in the housing market and this is important because it plays into confidence for households and household consumption is around 60% of GDP. We also know that for most Australians owning their own home is not only their dream, it is their biggest asset. They want to see its value appreciate over time, which has been the history in our country. In terms of the clearance rates, they have gone up and in terms of prices they are now starting to go up. So the interest rate cuts have contributed to a stabilisation in the housing market which we welcome.\u201d Whoah. The Reserve Bank\u2019s race to the bottom continued today with its third reduction in the cash rate in five months. It takes the benchmark borrowing rate in Australia to yet another record low of 0.75%. it\u2019s more good news for borrowers and house prices. But bad news for savers and \u2013 if you think that the sight of a central bank slashing rates to a record low is something to worry about \u2013 it\u2019s also bad news for the economy because it surely means the RBA expects things to get worse.. Anyway, here are the main points: The RBA has cut the cash rate by 0.25% to a record low of 0.75%. It\u2019s the third cut this year ; Governor Philip Lowe said the economy was at a turning point but the prospect of slower jobs growth and low inflation convinced him of the need to act; The Aussie dollar dipped 0.4% to US67.22c; Some economists were predicting further rate cuts this year; Comparison website Mozo said it will put more pressure on the big banks to pass on the cut to mortgage holders; Labor\u2019s Jim Chalmers has criticised the Coalition\u2019s economic management, as did the Greens The cut comes despite a 0.9% jump in house prices in September Labor\u2019s shadow treasurer Jim Chalmers put the cut on the coalition government\u2019s lack of action to stimulate the economy. \u201cIf the Liberals were doing a good job managing the economy the RBA wouldn\u2019t have needed to cut interest rates to another new record low today,\u201d Chalmers tweeted. BIS Oxford Economics are getting ahead of the curve, looking for the next big thing. They say we shouldn\u2019t expect a rate RISE until 2021. Chief economist Sarah Hunter says the board highlighted \u201cdownside risks to the global economic outlook, and the persistent headwinds facing the domestic economy\u201d. It expected jobs growth to \u201cslow significantly over the near term as the economy absorbs the residential construction downturn and sluggish retail environment\u201d. The bank is also projecting inflation to remain around 2% through to 2021, \u201cwhich suggests there will not be a rate rise until the end of 2021 at the earliest\u201d. Savers, read it and weep ... Capital Economics says the rate cut today was widely expected but says that the RBA\u2019s prediction of a slowdown in jobs growth (the aforementioned construction slump is a key factor here) points to another cut \u201cby the end of the year\u201d. The bank argued that forward-looking indicators of labour demand point to a slowdown in employment growth. Indeed, employment surveys suggest that jobs growth will slow from around 2.5% now to around 2.0% around the turn of the year. It\u2019s possible that the recent surge in the participation rate fizzles out at the same time, but we consider it more likely that unemployment will climb a bit further. Our forecast is that the unemployment rate will reach a peak at 5.5% in the first half of that year. Meanwhile, we think that global growth won\u2019t accelerate anytime soon. Business confidence will therefore remain muted and investment will probably keep falling. We reiterate our forecast that rates will fall to 0.5% before the end of the year. The comparison site Mozo.com says the rate cut could start a mortgage rate war after the online lenders Athena and Homestar said they would pass on the 0.25% cut to their customers in full. Such a move would put pressure on the big four banks to cut rates and give some more relief to Australia\u2019s debt burdened households. Here\u2019s Mozo director Kirsty Lamont: Online lenders are reacting to today\u2019s RBA cut with lightning speed. They\u2019re turning the screws on the big banks knowing the banks are in an unwinnable position, with the unenviable choice of having to either pass through today\u2019s cut in full to mortgage customers and take a hit to their net profit margins, or hold back part of the cut and risk losing even more borrowers to their cheaper rivals. The Greens say that the RBA has been railroaded into cutting rates because the government has refused to do its bit for the economy by increasing spending. This lack of so-called fiscal stimulus \u2013 as opposed to monetary stimulus from the RBA \u2013 has irritated senator Peter Whish-Wilson: Without government borrowing to fund an increase in infrastructure spending, record low interest rates are re-inflating the housing market and going towards other unproductive and speculative investments. This is diluting the effectiveness of monetary policy and is railroading the RBA towards QE. Instead of being concerned about this trend, the treasurer actually seems to be cheering it along. Just last week, Josh Frydenberg was spruiking the virtue of further increases in house prices, and encouraged banks to push the limits of responsible lending barely eight months since Commissioner Hayne handed down his report.\u201d The dollar spiked to US67.57c on the news of the RBA cut but has fallen back again in the last few minutes to US67.29c as traders digest the statement from Philip Lowe. In it he clearly lays out the prospect of more cuts \u2013 or even perhaps some less conventional policy such as money-printing or quantitative easing. Here\u2019s what the conclusion of the statement says (my emphasis in bold): It is reasonable to expect that an extended period of low interest rates will be required in Australia to reach full employment and achieve the inflation target. The board will continue to monitor developments, including in the labour market, and is prepared to ease monetary policy further if needed to support sustainable growth in the economy, full employment and the achievement of the inflation target over time. Here\u2019s some reaction to the news: Philip Lowe says in his statement that: the bank acted to boost jobs and incomes lower rates overseas have played a factor and more monetary easing \u2013 ie more cuts \u2013 are still on the table growth is weaker than expected but has reached a \u201cgentle turning point\u201d household spending still weak and wage growth subdued further signs of turnaround in housing market This is governor Philip Lowe\u2019s full statement after his board cut rates to yet another record low. It\u2019s the third cut this year and reflects the bank\u2019s concern that growth is still too sluggish to reduce unemployment and boost inflation. The RBA has cut rates to 0.75% Seconds to go ... Just a few minutes to go before we get the proverbial puff of white smoke from above Martin Place. But in the meantime some interesting commentary from the banking team at UBS. They have taken a fairly bearish view of Australia\u2019s big banks in the last couple of years and they are continuing their sceptical outlook. They say that although the housing credit downturn may be bottoming out, it\u2019s still hard yards ahead for the banks because low interest rates = low profits. The UBS team says that bank shares \u2013 the bedrock of all our super accounts \u2013 look too high: While the pick-up in lending is positive, bank fundamentals are increasingly challenged with ultra-low interest rates... With ongoing revenue pressure, we expect further dividend cuts and banks to rebase target [return of equity] to more realistic levels for an ultra-low rate environment. Following the re-rating, banks look expensive on 15.6x and 1.7x book with a falling EPS profile over the medium term. Across the ditch, a plunge in business confidence is continuing to hurt the New Zealand dollar. It has fallen below US62.49c, the lowest since September 2015. The RBNZ caught markets off guard in August when it cut rates by 0.5% to 1%. There were also encouraging numbers today from the Australian Industry Group (AiGroup) manufacturing index, which rose from 53.1 points to 54.7 points in September. However, another closely watched snapshot of the economy, the CBA/IHS Markit manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index, fell from 50.9 points to 50.3 points. Any reading over 50 indicates expansion so the numbers tend to suggest the economy is travelling OK. Not every Liberal in Canberra is hoping for a rate cut. My colleague Paul Karp has this: Liberal MP Tim Wilson, the chair of the House of Representatives economics committee, has told Guardian Australia that he hopes the RBA leaves interest rates on hold to give savers a break. My hope is that the RBA leaves interest rates alone. There\u2019s not sufficient evidence that there\u2019s pass through from the last two rate cuts to stimulate the economy but there is evidence it is fuelling house price rises and ultimately higher debt. Wilson has challenged the RBA to justify the effectiveness of monetary policy prompting a lengthy response from the central bank arguing - yes - rate cuts still work. The RBA said: In aggregate, Australian households benefit from the effect of lower interest rates. While the income of households with deposits is lower than if rates had not been reduced, the household sector as a whole has around twice as much debt as deposits. The CoreLogic house price index was not the only piece of data released today. On the other side of the ledger, the number of housing approvals fell again in August, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics this morning. Forecasters said the numbers showed that the construction downturn is not yet over. Approvals were down 1.1% in August and private house approvals dropped by 2.4%. Approvals are now at their lowest level since January 2013 and 44% below their November 2017 peak. Approvals dipped in every state and territory, with ACT (27.7%), the Northern Territory (8.7%) and NSW (5.4%) the hardest hit, in trend terms. Economists at JP Morgan said the figures would be a \u201cmeaningful drag\u201d on economic growth going forward. The approvals are \u201cterrible news for construction\u201d and point to a cut by the RBA in half an hour ... So more on the mega data dump this morning. The most eye-catching was the 0.9% rise in the average national house price for September, largely driven by a strong rebound in the Sydney and Melbourne markets. Values in the two biggest cities were up 1.7% over the month, according to the CoreLogic September home value index. Prices have been boosted by increased investor activity amid lower rates and an easing of lending requirements by the banks since the May election. Australia\u2019s two largest cities have recorded a rapid bounce-back in home values over the past two months, with Sydney up a cumulative 3.3% and Melbourne up 3.2% in August and September. Brisbane and Canberra were the only other capital cities to record a rise in dwelling values over the month, rising 0.1% and 1.0% respectively. Values held in Adelaide but fell 0.4% in Hobart and continued their long run of losses in Perth (down 0.8%) and Darwin (down 0.2%). Combined regional dwelling prices increased by 0.1 per cent, compared to a 1.1 per cent rise for combined capital city prices. The question will still be whether to take the plunge or not. You can read more on that here The ASX200 has risen ahead of today\u2019s rates decision. The benchmark index is up 17.30 points this lunchtime to 6,705.60, a rise of 0.26%. The Aussie dollar is under more pressure though. It\u2019s down 0.16% to US67.4c. Good afternoon and welcome to the live blog on the Reserve Bank\u2019s interest rate decision. The bank\u2019s board members are tipped by a majority of economists to cut the cash rate by 25 basis points to 0.75% this afternoon. The chief factors driving the move are continued sluggish economic growth and the need for the RBA to meet its inflation rate of between 2-3%. Any cut will be welcomed in Canberra where Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg have gamed the economy by opting for tax cuts and budget surplus rather than the large increase in government spending that some say would be better for the country than another rate cut. However, a rate cut may not be completely cut and dried, especially after the latest monthly house price figures from CoreLogic today showed their biggest rise for more than two years. The numbers suggest that the property downturn could be over and that further rate cuts \u2013 the cash rate is already at an all-time low \u2013 could inflate another housing bubble. On the other side of the ledger, building approvals fell again in August, indicating that the construction downturn still has some way to run. More on those figures later but on with the blog ...",

      "body": "<p>Victims of the 2010 cholera outbreak in Haiti, which killed at least 10,000 people and infected hundreds of thousands more, are petitioning the US supreme court on Tuesday to hold the UN accountable for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/dec/01/haiti-cholera-outbreak-stain-on-reputation-un-says\">having brought the disease to the stricken country</a>.</p> <p>The nine supreme court justices will meet in conference to discuss whether to hear <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6433169-Laventure-v-UN-S-Ct-Petition-1.html\">Laventure v UN</a> as one of their cases of the new term.

The issue is highly sensitive within the US, given that the UN is headquartered in New York where the annual <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/23/what-is-the-point-of-the-un-general-assembly\">general assembly</a> session has just been held, and given the large number of Haitians who live in America.</p> <p>The latest official figures, widely assumed to be understatements, put the number of dead in Haiti from cholera at 9,792 with a total of 819,995 suspected cases.</p> <p>Three thousand American and Haitian citizens harmed by the cholera epidemic are listed in the complaint before the supreme court. The lead plaintiff, Marie Laventure, is a nurse living in Atlanta. She has three siblings also in the US, and eight siblings still in Haiti.</p> <p>Laventure\u2019s father and stepmother died of cholera in 2012, leaving the siblings under the care of the elder children struggling to fend for themselves. \u201cLike so many others \u2013 in Haiti and the US as well \u2013 my family has suffered greatly because of the UN\u2019s actions,\u201d Laventure told the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cJustice demands UN accountability. That is why we are asking the US supreme court to uphold the promise the UN made when it put aside immunity and agreed to be liable in cases like ours.\u201d</p> <p>The New York-based lawyer representing the victims, James Haggerty, pointed to precedent set in 1996 when the UN had accepted liability for the damage done by its peacekeepers in the regular performance of their duties. Exceptions were made such as the fallout of combat and actions required as part of operational necessity, but the principle of accountability was acknowledged.</p> <p>Despite such precedent, the UN continues to put its efforts into health programs to fight the Haitian epidemic while denying any liability to the victims. \u201cAs it stands now, the UN can walk away from even those agreements it has made that it is liable. If words are to have any meaning, they should apply to the UN too,\u201d Haggerty said.</p> <p>The attorney added that immunity enabled a culture within the UN in which mishaps were more likely to happen. \u201cThe cholera epidemic happened because the UN felt it was never going to be liable and therefore failed to take basic steps to prevent it. Any time an organization feels it can never be held accountable, that\u2019s when mistakes happen, corners are cut and things are done that are negligent or worse.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Victims of the 2010 cholera outbreak in Haiti, which killed at least 10,000 people and infected hundreds of thousands more, are petitioning the US supreme court on Tuesday to hold the UN accountable for having brought the disease to the stricken country. The nine supreme court justices will meet in conference to discuss whether to hear Laventure v UN as one of their cases of the new term. The petition goes to the heart of the question: should the world body be answerable in domestic courts for the harm it causes people it is there to serve? The UN has admitted that cholera was introduced to Haiti by peacekeepers in 2010 after about 1,000 troops were redeployed from Nepal to help in emergency work following a devastating earthquake. Basic health measures that could have been taken to prevent the transfer of the disease at the cost to the UN of only $2,000 were not taken, and instead raw sewage from the peackekeepers\u2019 camps was dumped directly into rivers from which thousands of Haitians routinely drew water for cooking and drinking. A leaked report carried out by the UN itself a month after the initial outbreak of cholera found serious sanitation flaws in the Haiti peacekeeping mission. Yet for six years the world body continued to deny it had anything to do with the health catastrophe. Crucially, the UN continues to reject any requests for compensation from the hundreds of thousands of Haitian victims. It insists that it has total immunity from such claims relating to the harmful impact caused by its staff carrying out routine business. Now the US supreme court is being asked to consider the issue, and specifically whether the UN should be liable for the cholera disaster through domestic American courts. The issue is highly sensitive within the US, given that the UN is headquartered in New York where the annual general assembly session has just been held, and given the large number of Haitians who live in America. The latest official figures, widely assumed to be understatements, put the number of dead in Haiti from cholera at 9,792 with a total of 819,995 suspected cases. Three thousand American and Haitian citizens harmed by the cholera epidemic are listed in the complaint before the supreme court. The lead plaintiff, Marie Laventure, is a nurse living in Atlanta. She has three siblings also in the US, and eight siblings still in Haiti. Laventure\u2019s father and stepmother died of cholera in 2012, leaving the siblings under the care of the elder children struggling to fend for themselves. \u201cLike so many others \u2013 in Haiti and the US as well \u2013 my family has suffered greatly because of the UN\u2019s actions,\u201d Laventure told the Guardian. \u201cJustice demands UN accountability. That is why we are asking the US supreme court to uphold the promise the UN made when it put aside immunity and agreed to be liable in cases like ours.\u201d The New York-based lawyer representing the victims, James Haggerty, pointed to precedent set in 1996 when the UN had accepted liability for the damage done by its peacekeepers in the regular performance of their duties. Exceptions were made such as the fallout of combat and actions required as part of operational necessity, but the principle of accountability was acknowledged. Despite such precedent, the UN continues to put its efforts into health programs to fight the Haitian epidemic while denying any liability to the victims. \u201cAs it stands now, the UN can walk away from even those agreements it has made that it is liable. If words are to have any meaning, they should apply to the UN too,\u201d Haggerty said. The attorney added that immunity enabled a culture within the UN in which mishaps were more likely to happen. \u201cThe cholera epidemic happened because the UN felt it was never going to be liable and therefore failed to take basic steps to prevent it. Any time an organization feels it can never be held accountable, that\u2019s when mistakes happen, corners are cut and things are done that are negligent or worse.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "\ufeffThe quest for a fabled treasure trove containing jewels, gold and original Incan artefacts \u2013 and believed to have been buried on a South Pacific island by 18th century Spanish pirates \u2013 could be about to reach its dramatic conclusion. But the decision to allow a Dutch American textiles magnate to use heavy machinery to dig on Chile\u2019s sparsely populated Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands has sparked an outraged response from archaeologists and environmentalists. \u201cThe motive is profit, not archaeological interest,\u201d said Alejandra Vidal, the representative of the Chilean College of Archaeologists on the National Monuments Council. \u201cGiven the equipment that will be used, there\u2019s a very real risk of artefacts being lost or damaged in the process.\u201d Bernard Keiser, who has been searching for the hoard for more than two decades, has been granted permission to excavate a 400 sq metre plot near Puerto Ingl\u00e9s on Robinson Crusoe Island, one of the three main volcanic islets that make up the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Archipelago 600 miles off the Chilean coast. Chile\u2019s National Forestry Corporation\u2019s (Conaf) decision came even though the islands are protected by both national and international law, said Valentina Dur\u00e1n, the director of the Environmental Law Centre at the University of Chile\u2019s law faculty. \u201cThe area given over for the dig is doubly safeguarded, as it lies within the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez national park and was also designated a Unesco biosphere reserve in 1977,\u201d she said. \u201cRegulations are particularly stringent for foreigners to dig on sovereign Chilean soil in sites considered archaeological monuments ... What is clear from this case is that we need better protection, institutions and clearer laws for protected areas,\u201d said Dur\u00e1n. Adding to the controversy, Pablo Mira, the regional director of Conaf for Valpara\u00edso \u2013 under whose jurisdiction the islands fall \u2013 was abruptly dismissed from his post in September. Mira had been a vocal opponent of the treasure hunt, but Chilean authorities have insisted that his dismissal was unrelated to the excavation permit. Keiser, who could not be reached for comment, used scanning equipment to pinpoint a possible location after an exhaustive and expensive search that has thus far been conducted manually due to the area\u2019s conservation status. He now reportedly believes that the treasure is hidden in a synthetic tunnel beneath a thick slab of rock. Jos\u00e9 Manuel Rebolledo, the executive director of Conaf, has said that the necessary evaluations were made in order to guarantee that the dig will not affect the national park in any way. If successful, Keiser\u2019s search could put to rest the 300-year-old mystery surrounding the exact nature of the riches accrued by the Spanish sailor Juan Esteban Ubilla. According to historical record, Ubilla accumulated the hoard \u2013 said to be worth $10bn \u2013 on his travels along South America\u2019s Pacific coast in the early 18th century. He buried it in the remote Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands when his ship was intercepted by the British navy admiral Lord Anson in 1714. The haul is rumoured to contain original gold statues from Peru \u2013 including a necklace belonging to the wife of the last Inca emperor, Atahualpa \u2013 as well as 800 barrels of gold and silver coins. A crew sent to recover the treasure in 1761 under the command of the British navigator Cornelius Webb found the hoard and loaded it aboard their ship. However, a mast split in bad weather as they were leaving the island and Webb was forced to turn back and rebury the hoard. Webb then drew two treasure maps and wrote out coded instructions, one of which he sent back to England. Keiser acquired the second copy in 1998 from the family of the Chilean politician Luis Cousi\u00f1o. In 1704, the Scottish sailor Alexander Selkirk was marooned in the archipelago for four years, inspiring Daniel Defoe\u2019s novel Robinson Crusoe \u2013 after which one of the islands was renamed in 1966 in a bid to increase tourism.",

      "bodyText": "Amber Murrey, an American academic, was \u201cecstatic\u201d about being appointed associate professor in geography at Oxford University last year. But the dream turned sour two weeks ago when the Home Office refused to grant visas for her two daughters, aged four and nine, to live with her in the UK. Dr Murrey used an immigration lawyer to make sure the visa applications for her daughters, who have US passports, went smoothly, and was not anticipating a problem. Her husband has business commitments overseeing property renovations in Cameroon, where he is from, and the couple had included joint written consent for their daughters to live with her in Oxford. \u201cWhen I read those three unemotional sentences saying they were denying my children entry to the UK I felt complete disbelief,\u201d she says. \u201cI had already packed the girls\u2019 bags and bought their school uniforms. It is insane that you can have a legal document with both parents\u2019 consent to have the children with their mother and they simply say no, that can\u2019t happen.\u201d Her case will add to a tide of anger among academics, who say the Home Office\u2019s hostile immigration environment is making it difficult for talented people from abroad to forge an academic career in the UK. This is the second time in a month that the Home Office has refused a visa to an American academic based at Oxford University. Last month Education Guardian reported that Dr Elizabeth Ford, a music historian about to start a fellowship at Oxford, was given two weeks to leave after eight years in the UK, because the Home Office said it had granted her last visa erroneously. Young overseas academics say that universities are now so frightened of the tough new visa regime that, in some cases, they are automatically rejecting international candidates for jobs they should be eligible for. Dr Murrey, an expert on social change in Africa, who has published widely and previously held positions at universities in Cairo, Massachusetts and Ethiopia, took up her post in Oxford last year. Without proof of residency she couldn\u2019t set up schooling or somewhere to live in advance, so the couple decided she should establish a base in Oxford before moving the family. While she has been returning to Cameroon to see her daughters and husband in the university holidays, she says this has been an emotional strain. \u201cIt has been really hard, because I need to spend more time with my daughters but I am wary of being out of the UK for too long in case it jeopardises the terms of my tier 2 visa,\u201d she says. The news has hit the family hard. Murrey says: \u201cMy nine-year-old had been so excited about her new school, and our apartment near a meadow. After I told her their visas had been denied she told me: \u2018I know why they rejected me, it\u2019s because I\u2019ve been misbehaving this week, Mama\u2019. We both cried very hard.\u201d The Home Office rejection letters say that under immigration rules a child may only be given a visa if both parents are living together in the UK. This would be waived if the parent living here had sole responsibility for the children, or the other partner had died. \u201cThis policy seems to operate under the guise of keeping families together, but it is splitting mine apart,\u201d Murrey says. Ultimately the couple want the whole family to live together in Oxford, but Murrey says that right now they are just trying to \u201cdo what is best for our daughters\u201d. She doesn\u2019t know whether she has been singled out as a risk because her husband is from Cameroon. \u201cWe have family members and friends there who have been rejected for British visas in the past,\u201d she says. The Wellcome Trust, a health research charity, has evidence of around 100 cases in which academics, especially from African countries, have been refused visas to come to the UK for conferences, often for spurious reasons. The African Studies Association UK found that at least 17 delegates were refused entry for its biennial academic conference at Birmingham University last year. Insa Nolte, a lecturer in African culture at Birmingham, is frustrated that academics can\u2019t appeal against these decisions. \u201cThere is no process to identify immigration officers who consistently misjudge cases or who make racist assumptions,\u201d she says. \u201cIf we are going to find solutions to global concerns like food security and climate change, we need to collaborate with academics across the world.\u201d Meanwhile, young international academics who have gained their PhDs in Britain say some universities, fearful of the tougher visa rules, are automatically rejecting non-UK nationals for jobs for which they should be eligible.

A lack of awareness of the diversity of our people; a lack of awareness that this statement embodies the most common form of racism we face. Statements such as this are based on perpetuated stereotypes that seek to confine our diverse peoples to a single layer of identity. When we do not fit the mould conceptualised by the dominant culture, a certain level of discomfort and uncertainty arises. When we challenge these statements there is an uncomfortable and brisk shift in the discourse. When we stand strong in our identity and its complexity we are quickly labelled with the derogatory stereotypes of a people who, previous to our challenge, we could not possibly be. Then comes the counter-challenge that seeks to invalidate our right to identify, to assume that the disparities and injustices that are forced upon our people could not possibly apply to us. The audacity of such statements astounds me. How does an individual come to a place where they feel they have the unreserved right to question the identity of another? When was an individual\u2019s identity attributed solely to the colour of their eyes or the shape of their nose? To even begin to understand the complexities of identity, connection and belonging when it comes to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, there needs to be a process of critical self-reflection and unlearning. There needs to be historical truth telling and acknowledgment. How do we build resilience among our people in the face of persistent, systemic and individual racism? As a midwife having worked in the state health system, this type of behaviour is common and accepted. As a resilient people, I don\u2019t understand how we continue to accept a society, a government, a health system and a health workforce that is not responsive to our needs as First Nations peoples. Our need to be culturally safe, our need to be acknowledged, understood and respected, our need to have equitable access to services and equitable outcomes in health, education, employment \u2013 in life! I am concerned the conversations we have about racism, about dominant cultural paradigms and their impact on the health and wellbeing of our people and communities, do not seem to be changing. It is heartbreaking to hear our current Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander nursing and midwifery students sharing stories of culturally unsafe systems, of racism and a lack of support and understanding. It is time that we as a nation recognise that the gap that we see, the gap that we so easily talk about but fail to address, is systemic. The systems and the frameworks that form the foundations of our society have been developed by and for the dominant culture. It is time we collectively challenge these systems; it is time we demand Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander knowledges be included in all systems. It is this level of structural, systemic reform that is required if we are to disrupt the revolving discourse around achieving equity in this country. I\u2019d like to acknowledge the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander elders, our ancestors, our warriors, nurses, midwives, academics, educators, advocates, activists, policy writers and community members who have been challenging these systems since before I was born. I acknowledge the tireless work that has been done, that continues, and that is yet to begin. To the self-professed \u201cleaders\u201d of this country, those who continue to develop and enforce systems to benefit the majority and marginalise the minorities, I ask: how dare you? Neville Bonner asked this same question of Australia and our government at the 1998 constitutional convention. Every time I glimpse the mangroves that hug the shore of Ukerebagh Island, his birthplace, whether it be from Fingal or the other side of the river in Tweed, I think about this question.

      "body": "<p>Driving into the low hills outside Moreton-in-Marsh, the archetypal Cotswold village, I was slightly concerned about finding John Pawson\u2019s farmhouse from the sparse address I\u2019d been given. I need not have worried. Pawson, probably the most influential British architectural designer of his generation, has for 40 years been a minimalist scourge of chocolate box and chintz. I pass half a dozen farm dwellings in various states of confected picturesque before I reach one that instantly gives itself away with the discreet rigour of its window lines and the angle of its cut stone and the crispest junction of lawn and gravel. I don\u2019t know what the opposite of ramshackle is exactly, but Pawson does.</p> <p>He and his wife Catherine bought the farm buildings here six years ago. They had been owned by the neighbouring dairy farming family of nine siblings, two of whom, both bachelors in their 80s, had lived in them all their adult lives. The brothers inhabited a bedroom each and a makeshift kitchen in one of the add-ons to the original 17th-century house. The rest of the jumble of rooms and barns were filled with old farm tools and junk, and decorated with wallpapers of uncertain vintage. They are not any longer.</p> <p>After a brief introduction to the European elm and raw stainless steel of his perfectly hollowed-out kitchen, Pawson, who is a boyish 70 years old, walks me first around the medieval carp pond beside which the buildings are set. He removed 500 lorry loads of silt from the pond, once the preserve of the local monastery, and added a mahogany Cambridge-built punt. \u201cCatherine had always hankered after a place in the country but I was happy in London,\u201d Pawson says of the decision to buy this place. His wife had asked an estate agent to send her details of rose-covered cottages, but among them was this, with its 24 acres of ancient and listed \u201cridge and furrow\u201d fields. Pawson took a look and thought: this is more like it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4c09e554b25ab36be1e86c6ca91c8962620fe55c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c09e554b25ab36be1e86c6ca91c8962620fe55c/0_203_9555_6555/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018We are obsessional about detail, obviously\u2019: Pawson sees the house as a manifesto as well as a home.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"686\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We are obsessional about detail, obviously\u2019: Pawson sees the house as a manifesto as well as a home.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gilbert McCarragher</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe old brothers had made the bread oven their telephone booth. They had a cider press,\u201d he says. When he first went up to one attic Pawson discovered a room that no one had set foot in for half a century and which was filled corner to corner by cobwebs illuminated by a shaft of sunlight. His great regret was that he blundered into that spidery domain without his usually ever-present camera.</p> <p>Over the six years since, he has stripped out and given sympathetic order to the Grade II listed buildings, using lath and plaster for the walls, five eras of clay tiles for the roofs, and employing his trusted palette of local stone \u2013 in terrazzo floors \u2013 sharp-planed woodwork, Italian marble and as little else as possible. The building now takes its place in a new monograph of a decade of work that includes Pawson\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.johnpawson.com/works/the-design-museum\" title=\"\">Design Museum in London</a>, a Cistercian Abbey in Hungary, the Jaffa Hotel in Tel Aviv, and his Life House retreat in rural Powys. (Pawson likes to say he works on \u201ceverything from a spoon to a monastery\u201d.)</p> <p>He sees the Cotswold house as a manifesto as well as a home. Pawson has always been stimulated by the domestic. His breakthrough project, creating stark geometries in the apartment of his first wife <a href=\"http://www.johnpawson.com/works/van-royen-apartment\" title=\"\">Hester van Royen</a>, established his aesthetic. The west London home he created behind a Victorian facade in Notting Hill was the defining interior of the 1990s, ushering in double-height ceilings and ascetic-looking kitchens that met gardens seamlessly through high glass walls.</p> <p>Home Farm is a greener, rural iteration of that less-is-more dogma. He prefaces a brief note about the building in his pared-back journal \u2013 one paragraph and three images for each month \u2013 with a quote from Henry Thoreau: \u201cDo what you love. Know your own bone; gnaw at it, bury it, unearth it and gnaw it still.\u201d</p> <p>As he walks me around the newly gnawed volumes of his house \u2013 with its triple-glazed calm, and delight in perspective (there is a point that allows you to look the entire light-and-shade length of the newly connected 50m interior) \u2013 he dwells on its exposed character: the raw 10mm-thick stainless steel of worktops and window frames, which show the watermarks of the foundry process. The subtle shades of the lime plaster walls.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7eda703b8345687b3808e1b058f816649887ce08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7eda703b8345687b3808e1b058f816649887ce08/2812_0_11138_6688/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Home Farm from the outside, showing how the buildings are set around a medieval carp pond.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Home Farm from the outside, showing how the buildings are set around a medieval carp pond.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gilbert McCarragher</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe are obsessional about detail, obviously,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd because it is my own place, perhaps even more so. Though it is obviously the last job anyone in the office wants to work on \u2013 the boss\u2019s house.\u201d</p> <p>Before you meet Pawson, you fear he might be as austere as his seamless kitchen cupboards, but he wears any control freakery lightly, giving the sense that his work is serious so he does not have to be (his rooms share that sense, making dining tables a single focus, like stage sets for shared pleasure).</p> <p>He grew up in a big house near Halifax, on the edge of the moors. His family had a publicly listed textile business that dated to before the industrial revolution. The plan was for him eventually to take a hand in running it, but that lasted until he was 24 and went travelling to Japan. \u201cThe yearning was always getting to London,\u201d he says. \u201cbut there wasn\u2019t an obvious route, so I escaped and went around the world instead. I started in Japan and never left.\u201d He was 30 by the time he made it to London, by which time the family business was being run by his sister (it was eventually, like all those Halifax textile factories, sold off and closed).</p> <p>The idea of Japan had come from watching a film made by Tony Richardson, about a Zen Buddhist master. \u201cIt was so exquisitely filmed, the monks practising kendo at dawn and all that, I thought, \u2018Fuck, this is it, I\u2019ll go there and become enlightened.\u2019\u201d It was 1973. Pawson lasted half a day at a Zen monastery, where they put him to work cleaning. He saw enough in Japan to make him reluctant to return to Halifax, however, and eventually discovered his real vocation when he spent a year \u2013 \u201cmostly trying not to get in the way\u201d \u2013 in the studio of the great Japanese designer Shiro Kuramata. He brought Kuramata\u2019s disciplined attention to the beauty of material and form back to London.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a09a439ce3d37bd6befe4efc9be35f99dd80a204\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a09a439ce3d37bd6befe4efc9be35f99dd80a204/0_425_9585_5751/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pawson\u2019s Life House retreat in the Welsh countryside includes a \u2018contemplation space\u2019 featuring the words of philosopher Blaise Pascal, about the value  of time spent alone, engraved into a slab of slate set into the floor.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pawson\u2019s Life House retreat in the Welsh countryside includes a \u2018contemplation space\u2019 featuring the words of philosopher Blaise Pascal, about the value of time spent alone, engraved into a slab of slate set into the floor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gilbert McCarragher</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That attention, in which every sparse gesture and junction is made to matter, still serves him well. But inevitably, to achieve such idealised simplicity of form requires 30 kinds of human sweat and chaos. At one point in our tour of the house he points out a section of concrete work that provides a link between the buildings. Part of the concrete is smooth, some is more disturbed. \u201cWe had this brilliant guy from Belgium do it,\u201d he says. \u201cBut each part had to set before the next could be done and getting him back each time was more difficult. He was a passionate guy and going through some issues at the time, and you see that in the finish.\u201d Pawson\u2019s weakness is always to be \u201ctoo reasonable\u201d in such circumstances, he admits; he has learned to leave on-site negotiation to others. \u201cI get drawn into the human issues, you know: \u2018Don\u2019t worry about the wall, just get yourself well.\u2019 On paper and in my head I am entirely obsessional \u2013 but not if there is a human cost.\u201d</p> <p>That contradiction plays out in his manner; he appears too easygoing for someone so committed to precision. In a room that will become a larder once a cooling system has been installed the shelves have become a minor dumping area for kids\u2019 toys and other boxes of stuff \u2013 Pawson\u2019s three grown-up children are all regular visitors here; his daughter, the eldest, has a one-year-old son.</p> <p>\u201cClutter\u2026\u201d I note.</p> <p>\u201cFucking hell!\u201d he says, in mock alarm. And then, as if it is a well-worn internal mantra: \u201cLife\u2019s a compromise when you live with people. When Catherine goes away, I get everything absolutely in order and she goes slightly mad because I tidy up her papers. And within seconds she has messed up my work, but I am so happy to have her back I don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p> <p>Where does it come from, that impulse to empty space of objects?</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I just remember at a very early age, going back to school [he was at Eton] and really loving travelling light. Having very little just made me feel free.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"43f2b06e778691208e4330f6852eb457f9bc6ca0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43f2b06e778691208e4330f6852eb457f9bc6ca0/0_0_2295_2880/797.jpg\" alt=\"Pawson\u2019s Wooden Chapel, in a forest outside Dillingen, Germany, is one of seven contemporary chapels commissioned by the Elfriede Denzel Foundation.\" width=\"797\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pawson\u2019s Wooden Chapel, in a forest outside Dillingen, Germany, is one of seven contemporary chapels commissioned by the Elfriede Denzel Foundation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felix Friedmann</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Does that mania for clean lines not require constant vigilance though?</p> <p>\u201cI do enjoy tidying up. These are Catherine\u2019s things,\u201d he says, gesturing to books on a desk. \u201cMy instinct would be to put them in a cupboard.\u201d He recalls how he did just that before one journalist came to his house, and there was the question: what are your cupboards like? He opened the one he had crammed stuff into and it all fell out on top of him.</p> <p>They have had a full year at the finished house now, and are here most weekends and for a month in the summer. Pawson\u2019s original plan was to work here, but he finds that once he arrives his mind seems to empty of deadline pressure. One of the problems of framing all the rolling views with such care is that there is always too much to look at. He still works best, he says, in his windowless basement office at the practice in King\u2019s Cross, where the only visual stimulation is a white wall.</p> <p>He runs a small office of 25; they do designs and work with other practices on engineering and construction. Over the next five years they will probably have 30 projects that might vary from a hotel to an exhibition, he suggests. \u201cEvery one will have some part of it which is me, otherwise there is no point.\u201d</p> <p>Does he hire people in his own image?</p> <p>\u201cDefinitely not if I can help it.\u201d</p> <p>How is he as a boss?</p> <p>\u201cWell,\u201d he says, \u201cPeople tend to stay. I do have a temper but it is over quickly. I always start the year saying to everyone, \u2018OK this year I am not going to lose it\u2019. Usually I make it to 4 January. For my birthday they did a whole load of slogans of things I have yelled at one time or another. My favourite was: \u201cFind me that letter that says I\u2019m a genius!\u201d</p> <p>In his book, he notes how \u201cthe client is the critic\u201d. He says that the sentence he most dreads hearing is: \u201cI have put together some ideas for you to download before we meet.\u201d Some commissions seem like gifts, however. He still cannot believe his fortune in being asked to design the Abbey complex in Hungary. \u201cTo begin with I thought it was a joke,\u201d he says. \u201cWe used to have lots of wind-ups in the office; people would go out to a phone box and pretend to be a sheikh with an emirate to design or whatever.\u201d</p> <p>Were the monks exacting clients?</p> <p>\u201cWell, they gave me a file of every room\u2019s optimum temperature,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd all 80 of them had been allowed to come up with their own spec. It was all \u2018I would like my chest of drawers to be this high\u2019 or whatever.\u201d He obviously disregarded all that and made them all the same.</p> <p>He stayed at the monastery for a week when it was finished, living in the dorm, getting up with the monks, eating with them, praying seven times a day. It was a silent Trappist order. How did he manage?</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get the calling, unfortunately,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I could see the attractions of not drinking too much and getting good sleep and not talking. I should really go back every year. Catherine is Catholic and very keen for me to convert.\u201d</p> <p>It is tempting to see a spiritual impulse in his work \u2013 certainly others appear to see it; as well as the Hungarian project he has lately designed a <a href=\"http://www.johnpawson.com/works/moritzkirche\" title=\"\">church in St Moritz</a> and <a href=\"http://www.johnpawson.com/works/wooden-chapel\" title=\"\">a log chapel</a> in a forest in Germany. His books of photographs tend toward the sublime. Does he recognise that in himself?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bbbe0a8ffdb11ee0feb7085c9da399b283634dcb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bbbe0a8ffdb11ee0feb7085c9da399b283634dcb/0_847_4092_3207/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018My mother would have liked me to become a missionary\u2019: John Pawson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"784\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018My mother would have liked me to become a missionary\u2019: John Pawson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gilbert McCarragher</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If it exists he traces it back to childhood. \u201cMy mother would have liked me to become a missionary,\u201d he says. \u201cShe was the daughter of quite strict Methodists, saintly in a Yorkshire way. The doctor burst into floods of tears when she died.\u201d</p> <p>He suggests that his mother found her considerable inherited wealth difficult. \u201cShe dressed very modestly and didn\u2019t like material things. My father \u2013 and I \u2013 in contrast, always quite liked the best of things, nice cars, a big old Irish wolfhound for a dog, the best racing bike.\u201d</p> <p>Would it be fair to say he has found a way of marrying those two forces?</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p> <p>Certainly from the moment that Calvin Klein called to ask Pawson to design his <a href=\"http://www.johnpawson.com/works/calvin-klein-collections-store/\" title=\"\">flagship New York store</a> in 1993, versions of his minimalism have attracted that bonus-rich, money-market generation that justifies its outrageous fortune with painful hours in the gym and eye-wateringly expensive interiors that apparently eschew worldly goods. Pawson is currently working on a dozen private houses, as well as two hotels for his longtime collaborator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2001/jan/13/weekend.lindsaybaker\" title=\"\">Ian Schrager</a>.</p> <p>He insists that he still finds his brand of opulent minimalism as bracing as ever. He can\u2019t imagine retirement.</p> <p>Is it terribly strange to be 70, I wonder?</p> <p>\u201cI think it was a mistake to celebrate it with a party,\u201d he says, with mock glumness. \u201cCatherine insisted on it. But it now means I can\u2019t pretend it hasn\u2019t happened. Up until then I think I have always vaguely assumed I was about the same age as the person I was talking to, from the mid-30s upwards, at least.\u201d He went to a school reunion of his Eton year not long ago (Sir Nicholas Soames was in his class). \u201cI got there and was directed to a room full of red-faced, white-haired old men. I took one look and thought I had the wrong place.\u201d As he went to leave a voice boomed out: \u201cPawson!\u201d \u201cI thought \u2018Christ, this is me.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Catherine calls us to lunch in the kitchen at the long elm table fronting a glass wall that rises like a sash on a vast counterweight. Pawson and his wife are currently writing a cookbook based around the farm kitchen. \u201cAt the moment there are a hundred recipes, just everyday stuff,\u201d he says, while admitting that he does \u201cmore of the eating and the advising\u201d than the cooking. We share a warm salad of charred peppers and tomatoes on sourdough and then ice cream with a peach compote. Pawson has, of course, designed the plates and the bowls and the cutlery and the water glasses. Their collective effect seems to demand to make each mouthful a mindful haiku. I try not to crunch too hard on the toast.</p> <p>Is there anything that he hasn\u2019t designed?</p> <p>He looks around. \u201cI have done the taps. And the light switches, the escutcheons and the door knobs are mine. And these salt and pepper pots.\u201d He picks up a weighty minimalist oval. \u201cI suppose I like to see if I can do better than what there is.\u201d</p> <p>When he says better, what does he mean?</p> <p>\u201cWell, simpler,\u201d he says, simply. </p> <p><em>John Pawson: Anatomy of Minimum is published by Phaidon, \u00a349.95 (<a href=\"https://uk.phaidon.com/store/architecture/john-pawson-anatomy-of-minimum-9780714874845/\">phaidon.com</a>)</em></p>",

He saw enough in Japan to make him reluctant to return to Halifax, however, and eventually discovered his real vocation when he spent a year \u2013 \u201cmostly trying not to get in the way\u201d \u2013 in the studio of the great Japanese designer Shiro Kuramata. He brought Kuramata\u2019s disciplined attention to the beauty of material and form back to London. That attention, in which every sparse gesture and junction is made to matter, still serves him well. But inevitably, to achieve such idealised simplicity of form requires 30 kinds of human sweat and chaos. At one point in our tour of the house he points out a section of concrete work that provides a link between the buildings. Part of the concrete is smooth, some is more disturbed. \u201cWe had this brilliant guy from Belgium do it,\u201d he says. \u201cBut each part had to set before the next could be done and getting him back each time was more difficult. He was a passionate guy and going through some issues at the time, and you see that in the finish.\u201d Pawson\u2019s weakness is always to be \u201ctoo reasonable\u201d in such circumstances, he admits; he has learned to leave on-site negotiation to others. \u201cI get drawn into the human issues, you know: \u2018Don\u2019t worry about the wall, just get yourself well.\u2019 On paper and in my head I am entirely obsessional \u2013 but not if there is a human cost.\u201d That contradiction plays out in his manner; he appears too easygoing for someone so committed to precision. In a room that will become a larder once a cooling system has been installed the shelves have become a minor dumping area for kids\u2019 toys and other boxes of stuff \u2013 Pawson\u2019s three grown-up children are all regular visitors here; his daughter, the eldest, has a one-year-old son. \u201cClutter\u2026\u201d I note. \u201cFucking hell!\u201d he says, in mock alarm. And then, as if it is a well-worn internal mantra: \u201cLife\u2019s a compromise when you live with people. When Catherine goes away, I get everything absolutely in order and she goes slightly mad because I tidy up her papers. And within seconds she has messed up my work, but I am so happy to have her back I don\u2019t mind.\u201d Where does it come from, that impulse to empty space of objects? \u201cI don\u2019t know. I just remember at a very early age, going back to school [he was at Eton] and really loving travelling light. Having very little just made me feel free.\u201d Does that mania for clean lines not require constant vigilance though? \u201cI do enjoy tidying up. These are Catherine\u2019s things,\u201d he says, gesturing to books on a desk. \u201cMy instinct would be to put them in a cupboard.\u201d He recalls how he did just that before one journalist came to his house, and there was the question: what are your cupboards like? He opened the one he had crammed stuff into and it all fell out on top of him. They have had a full year at the finished house now, and are here most weekends and for a month in the summer. Pawson\u2019s original plan was to work here, but he finds that once he arrives his mind seems to empty of deadline pressure. One of the problems of framing all the rolling views with such care is that there is always too much to look at. He still works best, he says, in his windowless basement office at the practice in King\u2019s Cross, where the only visual stimulation is a white wall. He runs a small office of 25; they do designs and work with other practices on engineering and construction. Over the next five years they will probably have 30 projects that might vary from a hotel to an exhibition, he suggests. \u201cEvery one will have some part of it which is me, otherwise there is no point.\u201d Does he hire people in his own image? \u201cDefinitely not if I can help it.\u201d How is he as a boss? \u201cWell,\u201d he says, \u201cPeople tend to stay. I do have a temper but it is over quickly. I always start the year saying to everyone, \u2018OK this year I am not going to lose it\u2019. Usually I make it to 4 January. For my birthday they did a whole load of slogans of things I have yelled at one time or another. My favourite was: \u201cFind me that letter that says I\u2019m a genius!\u201d In his book, he notes how \u201cthe client is the critic\u201d. He says that the sentence he most dreads hearing is: \u201cI have put together some ideas for you to download before we meet.\u201d Some commissions seem like gifts, however. He still cannot believe his fortune in being asked to design the Abbey complex in Hungary. \u201cTo begin with I thought it was a joke,\u201d he says. \u201cWe used to have lots of wind-ups in the office; people would go out to a phone box and pretend to be a sheikh with an emirate to design or whatever.\u201d Were the monks exacting clients? \u201cWell, they gave me a file of every room\u2019s optimum temperature,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd all 80 of them had been allowed to come up with their own spec. It was all \u2018I would like my chest of drawers to be this high\u2019 or whatever.\u201d He obviously disregarded all that and made them all the same. He stayed at the monastery for a week when it was finished, living in the dorm, getting up with the monks, eating with them, praying seven times a day. It was a silent Trappist order. How did he manage? \u201cI didn\u2019t get the calling, unfortunately,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I could see the attractions of not drinking too much and getting good sleep and not talking. I should really go back every year. Catherine is Catholic and very keen for me to convert.\u201d It is tempting to see a spiritual impulse in his work \u2013 certainly others appear to see it; as well as the Hungarian project he has lately designed a church in St Moritz and a log chapel in a forest in Germany. His books of photographs tend toward the sublime. Does he recognise that in himself? If it exists he traces it back to childhood. \u201cMy mother would have liked me to become a missionary,\u201d he says. \u201cShe was the daughter of quite strict Methodists, saintly in a Yorkshire way. The doctor burst into floods of tears when she died.\u201d He suggests that his mother found her considerable inherited wealth difficult. \u201cShe dressed very modestly and didn\u2019t like material things. My father \u2013 and I \u2013 in contrast, always quite liked the best of things, nice cars, a big old Irish wolfhound for a dog, the best racing bike.\u201d Would it be fair to say he has found a way of marrying those two forces? \u201cPerhaps.\u201d Certainly from the moment that Calvin Klein called to ask Pawson to design his flagship New York store in 1993, versions of his minimalism have attracted that bonus-rich, money-market generation that justifies its outrageous fortune with painful hours in the gym and eye-wateringly expensive interiors that apparently eschew worldly goods. Pawson is currently working on a dozen private houses, as well as two hotels for his longtime collaborator Ian Schrager. He insists that he still finds his brand of opulent minimalism as bracing as ever. He can\u2019t imagine retirement. Is it terribly strange to be 70, I wonder? \u201cI think it was a mistake to celebrate it with a party,\u201d he says, with mock glumness. \u201cCatherine insisted on it. But it now means I can\u2019t pretend it hasn\u2019t happened. Up until then I think I have always vaguely assumed I was about the same age as the person I was talking to, from the mid-30s upwards, at least.\u201d He went to a school reunion of his Eton year not long ago (Sir Nicholas Soames was in his class). \u201cI got there and was directed to a room full of red-faced, white-haired old men. I took one look and thought I had the wrong place.\u201d As he went to leave a voice boomed out: \u201cPawson!\u201d \u201cI thought \u2018Christ, this is me.\u2019\u201d Catherine calls us to lunch in the kitchen at the long elm table fronting a glass wall that rises like a sash on a vast counterweight. Pawson and his wife are currently writing a cookbook based around the farm kitchen. \u201cAt the moment there are a hundred recipes, just everyday stuff,\u201d he says, while admitting that he does \u201cmore of the eating and the advising\u201d than the cooking. We share a warm salad of charred peppers and tomatoes on sourdough and then ice cream with a peach compote. Pawson has, of course, designed the plates and the bowls and the cutlery and the water glasses. Their collective effect seems to demand to make each mouthful a mindful haiku. I try not to crunch too hard on the toast. Is there anything that he hasn\u2019t designed? He looks around. \u201cI have done the taps. And the light switches, the escutcheons and the door knobs are mine. And these salt and pepper pots.\u201d He picks up a weighty minimalist oval. \u201cI suppose I like to see if I can do better than what there is.\u201d When he says better, what does he mean? \u201cWell, simpler,\u201d he says, simply.

It\u2019s the fastest and most efficient of Apple\u2019s chips yet, but the reality is that it\u2019s very difficult to tell. The iPhone 11 doesn\u2019t feel any faster than last year\u2019s iPhone XR/XS, or in fact the iPhone X in day-to-day usage.</p> <p>That\u2019s not surprising as Apple focuses its chips on doing the things you\u2019d normally do more efficiently, with power to do something unusual if you need it. That means the iPhone 11 should still be a top-performer in two, three, maybe four years from now. So really the only thing you need to know is that the iPhone 11 will handle everything you are likely to do, and then some.</p> <p>Apple also says that it\u2019s managed to make the iPhone 11 last an hour longer than the iPhone XR, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/31/iphone-xr-review-apple-big-bezels-battery-face-id-screen\">lasted 32 hours</a> between charges in my testing.</p> <p>I\u2019m happy to report that\u2019s a bit of an underestimate. The iPhone 11 lasts closer to 35 hours between charges, which makes it the longest-lasting iPhone to have crossed my test bench, getting me from 7am though until 6pm the following day.</p> <p>That was after the iOS 13.1.1 update, while using it as my primary device without a smartwatch attached, sending and receiving 150 emails and messages, 80 push notifications, listening to five hours of music on Bluetooth headphones, watching an hour of Netflix, and shooting about 10 photos a day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4cee7d9b64f9ea7606de98b9e20065261cb5881d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4cee7d9b64f9ea7606de98b9e20065261cb5881d/465_207_4282_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Apple iphone 11\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The latest iOS 13 update will attempt to improve your battery\u2019s longevity by reducing its time fully charged.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Charging the iPhone 11 with the included 5W charger is glacially slow, taking well over four hours to hit 100% from zero. Why Apple still ships a \u00a3729 phone with such a pathetic charger, I don\u2019t know. With the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MU7W2B/A/18w-usb-c-power-adapter\">\u00a329 18W USB-C charger</a> and <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MQGJ2ZM/A/usb-c-to-lightning-cable-1-m\">\u00a319 USB-C to Lightning cable</a> that ships in the box with the iPhone 11 Pro, the iPhone 11 fully charged in just over 100 minutes, reaching 80% in well under and hour, which is more like it. Any USB-C power delivery chargers of 18W or higher will achieve the same results and can be had for one-third less.</p> <p>It\u2019s also worth noting that iOS 13 includes a battery optimising feature, which is designed to learn your habits and only charge the battery past 80% when it thinks you need it to extend its longevity. Apple is also clearly slowing charging down to a trickle above 95% regardless of charger, meaning that it\u2019s probably not worth trying to charge it much beyond 90% if you don\u2019t need to.</p> <h2>iOS 13.1.1</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6de0881d6de9682ebc614a95eda8bf83fe263d61\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6de0881d6de9682ebc614a95eda8bf83fe263d61/384_345_4275_2566/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Apple iphone 11\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">iOS 13 introduces a few new features, but remains very similar to iOS 12 and 11 before that.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The iPhone 11 came out of the box with iOS 13 but was quickly updated to iOS 13.1 and then iOS 13.1.1, which was a good thing, as prior to the updates it was filled with bugs giving me all kinds of issues on three different iPhone 11 series phones.</p> <p>First off, the camera confirmation for restoring it from another iPhone didn\u2019t work. Then I was immediately stuck in a password-demand loop for an email account, which ended up with me having to hit the cancel button and then quickly enter one character of my 35-character password before the password demand popped back up blocking me from entering more. Hit cancel, rinse and repeat. Absolutely infuriating.</p> <p>I had issues with location permissions getting stuck on \u201cask every time\u201d for some apps. I also had several hard lockups of the phone prompting the three-button combo <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201412\">force restart procedure</a> (up, down, hold power for ages), text in widgets and other areas was compressed and overlapping each other, and sometimes the camera failed to activate when launched.</p> <p>Most of the problems have been solved since the update to iOS 13.1.1, and it even added an extra hour to my battery tests.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af088e44c27bf04547b71383a2dda6deb287b947\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af088e44c27bf04547b71383a2dda6deb287b947/263_394_4527_2717/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Apple iphone 11\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dark mode is one of the new features in iOS 13.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The big new features for iOS 13 are dark mode, which turns the interface from a predominately black text on white background to white text on a dark background, either manually or on a schedule.</p> <p>You can now also long-press on control centre buttons such as Bluetooth or wifi, first to open a up more detail, then a second time to open up a quick connect menu as well as a button to take you straight to the appropriate place in the settings app for more extensive changes. It is a user-friendly feature that Android has had for years, so it\u2019s good to finally see Apple catch up.</p> <p>A few new privacy options are welcome, including the ability to silence unknown and spam callers and finer-grain location permissions. Menstrual cycle tracking is now integrated into the Health app alongside headphone audio level, and there\u2019s a new summary view, which makes the app more friendly and useful at a glance.</p> <p>It\u2019s worth pointing out that Apple still provides the industry\u2019s longest software support lifecycle of about five years from release where the best rivals cap out at about three years. It means you can safely use the phone for longer as you will continue to get important security updates as well as new features via iOS version updates.</p> <h2>Camera</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6eaefdad8234b43a21f6fb25b661b1e4972a8c9d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6eaefdad8234b43a21f6fb25b661b1e4972a8c9d/553_562_3680_2209/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Apple iphone 11\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The camera app shows the main camera shot in the middle with the ultra-wide angle view visible to the sides under the interface elements to give you an idea of what you could capture if you zoom out.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The iPhone 11 has a new dual 12-megapixel camera on the back. Oddly you get an ultra-wide camera alongside a standard camera, not the more typical 2x optical zoom camera. That means you\u2019ve effectively got 0.5x and 1x optical zoom then up to 5x digital zoom, which is good, but doesn\u2019t hold a flame to real optical zoom.</p> <p>Apple has significantly upped its game in the camera department this year, particularly in poor lighting conditions. Photos in good lighting conditions are some of the best on a smartphone, producing detail-rich and colour-accurate photos. The main camera is good, but the ultrawide is arguably the best in its class and is a lot of fun to shoot with.</p> <p>Other than your typical ultra-wide vistas, you can also use the new camera to photograph more of a building or object you can\u2019t get far enough away from to use the main camera.</p> <p>Portrait mode is good too, and unlike on the XR can be used on more than just people. Apple\u2019s smart HDR mode is also improved, producing images that are closer to class-leading Google Pixel cameras.

It\u2019s got a three-year-old design, which Apple broke the mould <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/10/iphone-x-review-apple-face-id-all-screen-design-home-button\">with in 2017 when it launched the iPhone X</a> but now looks dated against the competition, particularly with the thicker bezels on the LCD screen. Things have moved on in the era of the all-screen smartphone.</p> <p>It\u2019s fairly large, heavy and difficult to grip and use with one hand, but is also extremely well made and feels solid. These are all attributes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/31/iphone-xr-review-apple-big-bezels-battery-face-id-screen\">shared by its predecessor the iPhone XR</a>, as the iPhone 11 is essentially new guts in last year\u2019s design.</p> <p>At \u00a3729 the iPhone 11 isn\u2019t exactly cheap, costing the same as the top-of-the-line phones from competitors. But what you get for your \u00a3729 is Apple\u2019s latest top-of-the-range processor with performance to match. Battery life that will easily see you into a second day, maybe a third if you\u2019re careful. Camera performance that is up there with the very best, but lacking an optical zoom, replaced instead by a fun ultra-wide angle camera.</p> <p>You also get five years of software updates, which can\u2019t be sniffed at. With a battery swap at some point there\u2019s no reason an iPhone 11 won\u2019t last you five years if you\u2019re careful with it. In <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/iphone-11-and-pro-drop-test-we-couldnt-crack-these-phones-broke-camera/\">some tests</a> the glass appears fairly tough to break, but <a href=\"http://blog.squaretrade.com/squaretrade-tests-the-new-iphone-11/\">less so in others</a>, so whether it will survive real-world drops remains to be seen.</p> <p>So the iPhone 11 is the iPhone for people who don\u2019t really care about smartphones and just want a new iPhone. Except that it\u2019s not that simple. Apple still sells the iPhone XR, which is essentially the same phone minus a second camera and one year less of software support, which is still at least four years, for \u00a3100 less <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-xr\">at \u00a3629</a>. And then there\u2019s the iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max, which have a third camera, a significantly better screen and the cachet of being \u201cthe best iPhone\u201d.</p> <p>If your primary driver is to buy the best, cheapest iPhone you can get, that\u2019s the iPhone XR in 2019. If you want the best iPhone you can get, that\u2019s one of the new iPhone 11 Pro line. So where does that leave the iPhone 11?</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Pros:</strong> great camera, night mode water resistant, wireless charging, Face ID, good battery life, good performance, good screen, long software support</p> <p><strong>Cons:</strong> no headphone socket, no fingerprint scanner, dated design, expensive, no fast charger or USB-C cable in the box, no headphones adapter in the box</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd6285bdd1cd5280c11134df7631a8493d808df2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd6285bdd1cd5280c11134df7631a8493d808df2/300_523_4320_2592/1000.jpg\" alt=\"iphone 11 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The red version is particularly attractive, and a small part of the sale <a href=\"https://www.red.org/\">goes to RED</a> and in turn to Global Fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Other reviews</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/mar/06/best-smartphone-iphone-samsung-google-huawei-ios-android-buyers-guide-compared-ranked\">Best smartphone 2019: iPhone, OnePlus, Samsung and Huawei compared and ranked</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jun/06/samsung-galaxy-s10-review-the-sweet-spot\">Samsung Galaxy S10 review: the sweet spot</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jun/18/samsung-galaxy-s10e-review-the-cheaper-one\">Samsung Galaxy S10e review: the cheaper one</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/17/oneplus-7-review-competition-beating-performance-for-less\">OnePlus 7 review: competition-beating performance for less</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/31/oneplus-7-pro-review-an-absolute-beast-in-every-way\">OnePlus 7 Pro review: an absolute beast in every way</a></strong></p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "The iPhone 11 is Apple\u2019s latest lower cost smartphone for 2019 that\u2019s clearly aimed at a broader market, offering most of what its top phones do but for \u00a3320 less. Costing from \u00a3729, the iPhone 11 is also \u00a320 cheaper than last year\u2019s iPhone XR was on launch \u2013 the phone it has now replaced. In fact the iPhone 11 is identical on the outside to the iPhone XR in almost all the ways that matter. It\u2019s the same size and weight. It\u2019s got the same glass and aluminium design, same 6.1in LCD screen with rounded corners, the same large notch at the top and same thick bezels around the sides. Flip it over and it\u2019s got the same glass rear, except that \u201ciPhone\u201d is no longer written on the back and the Apple logo is positioned lower. The biggest difference is the new large, square camera lump in the top left corner, which on the iPhone 11 houses a new dual camera system. The phone is well built, feeling extremely solid and it has the best LCD screen you\u2019re likely to see on a phone although it isn\u2019t as good-looking, colour rich, bright or high contrast as the OLED screens fitted to the iPhone 11 Pro or Apple\u2019s many rivals costing \u00a3500 and up. The iPhone 11 also suffers from the same disadvantages as the iPhone XR before it, namely it\u2019s fairly heavy and wide with rounded edges that provide little in the way of grip. Compared to Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S10, which has the same size 6.1in screen, the iPhone 11 is 5.3mm wider and 37g heavier and significantly harder to use one-handed. Specifications Screen: 6.1in liquid retina HD (LCD) (326ppi) Processor: Apple A13 Bionic RAM: 4GB Storage: 64, 128 or 256GB Operating system: iOS 13 Camera: dual 12MP rear cameras with OIS, 12MP front-facing camera Connectivity: LTE, wifi 6, NFC, Bluetooth 5, lightning, ultra wideband and GPS Dimensions: 150.9mm x 75.7mm x 8.3mm Weight: 194g A13 Bionic chip The iPhone 11 shares the same core as the iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max: Apple\u2019s latest A13 Bionic chip, 4GB of RAM and at least 64GB of storage. It\u2019s the fastest and most efficient of Apple\u2019s chips yet, but the reality is that it\u2019s very difficult to tell. The iPhone 11 doesn\u2019t feel any faster than last year\u2019s iPhone XR/XS, or in fact the iPhone X in day-to-day usage. That\u2019s not surprising as Apple focuses its chips on doing the things you\u2019d normally do more efficiently, with power to do something unusual if you need it. That means the iPhone 11 should still be a top-performer in two, three, maybe four years from now. So really the only thing you need to know is that the iPhone 11 will handle everything you are likely to do, and then some. Apple also says that it\u2019s managed to make the iPhone 11 last an hour longer than the iPhone XR, which lasted 32 hours between charges in my testing. I\u2019m happy to report that\u2019s a bit of an underestimate. The iPhone 11 lasts closer to 35 hours between charges, which makes it the longest-lasting iPhone to have crossed my test bench, getting me from 7am though until 6pm the following day. That was after the iOS 13.1.1 update, while using it as my primary device without a smartwatch attached, sending and receiving 150 emails and messages, 80 push notifications, listening to five hours of music on Bluetooth headphones, watching an hour of Netflix, and shooting about 10 photos a day. Charging the iPhone 11 with the included 5W charger is glacially slow, taking well over four hours to hit 100% from zero. Why Apple still ships a \u00a3729 phone with such a pathetic charger, I don\u2019t know. With the \u00a329 18W USB-C charger and \u00a319 USB-C to Lightning cable that ships in the box with the iPhone 11 Pro, the iPhone 11 fully charged in just over 100 minutes, reaching 80% in well under and hour, which is more like it. Any USB-C power delivery chargers of 18W or higher will achieve the same results and can be had for one-third less. It\u2019s also worth noting that iOS 13 includes a battery optimising feature, which is designed to learn your habits and only charge the battery past 80% when it thinks you need it to extend its longevity. Apple is also clearly slowing charging down to a trickle above 95% regardless of charger, meaning that it\u2019s probably not worth trying to charge it much beyond 90% if you don\u2019t need to. iOS 13.1.1 The iPhone 11 came out of the box with iOS 13 but was quickly updated to iOS 13.1 and then iOS 13.1.1, which was a good thing, as prior to the updates it was filled with bugs giving me all kinds of issues on three different iPhone 11 series phones. First off, the camera confirmation for restoring it from another iPhone didn\u2019t work. Then I was immediately stuck in a password-demand loop for an email account, which ended up with me having to hit the cancel button and then quickly enter one character of my 35-character password before the password demand popped back up blocking me from entering more. Hit cancel, rinse and repeat. Absolutely infuriating. I had issues with location permissions getting stuck on \u201cask every time\u201d for some apps. I also had several hard lockups of the phone prompting the three-button combo force restart procedure (up, down, hold power for ages), text in widgets and other areas was compressed and overlapping each other, and sometimes the camera failed to activate when launched. Most of the problems have been solved since the update to iOS 13.1.1, and it even added an extra hour to my battery tests. The big new features for iOS 13 are dark mode, which turns the interface from a predominately black text on white background to white text on a dark background, either manually or on a schedule. You can now also long-press on control centre buttons such as Bluetooth or wifi, first to open a up more detail, then a second time to open up a quick connect menu as well as a button to take you straight to the appropriate place in the settings app for more extensive changes. It is a user-friendly feature that Android has had for years, so it\u2019s good to finally see Apple catch up. A few new privacy options are welcome, including the ability to silence unknown and spam callers and finer-grain location permissions. Menstrual cycle tracking is now integrated into the Health app alongside headphone audio level, and there\u2019s a new summary view, which makes the app more friendly and useful at a glance. It\u2019s worth pointing out that Apple still provides the industry\u2019s longest software support lifecycle of about five years from release where the best rivals cap out at about three years. It means you can safely use the phone for longer as you will continue to get important security updates as well as new features via iOS version updates. Camera The iPhone 11 has a new dual 12-megapixel camera on the back. Oddly you get an ultra-wide camera alongside a standard camera, not the more typical 2x optical zoom camera. That means you\u2019ve effectively got 0.5x and 1x optical zoom then up to 5x digital zoom, which is good, but doesn\u2019t hold a flame to real optical zoom. Apple has significantly upped its game in the camera department this year, particularly in poor lighting conditions. Photos in good lighting conditions are some of the best on a smartphone, producing detail-rich and colour-accurate photos. The main camera is good, but the ultrawide is arguably the best in its class and is a lot of fun to shoot with. Other than your typical ultra-wide vistas, you can also use the new camera to photograph more of a building or object you can\u2019t get far enough away from to use the main camera. Portrait mode is good too, and unlike on the XR can be used on more than just people. Apple\u2019s smart HDR mode is also improved, producing images that are closer to class-leading Google Pixel cameras. But the biggest boost is Apple\u2019s new night mode, which finally brings the iPhone\u2019s very low-light performance up to scratch with the very best. It\u2019s not as fast as Huawei\u2019s P30 Pro, which doesn\u2019t need a special night mode to shoot similar photos, nor quite as dramatic as Google\u2019s Pixel 3, but produces images that are often lighter and better controlled. The automatic mode takes multiple frames between one and three seconds when handheld, depending on available light and how much you are shaking the phone. Stick it on a tripod and you can set it to 30 seconds, which is best illustrated with starry sky shots \u2013 something I couldn\u2019t test in dank, rainy Britain. The iPhone still struggles a little with indoor lighting where it\u2019s not quite dark enough to benefit from night mode so produces images that are a little dark and lacking in detail. The selfie camera in particular produces somewhat grainy images here, but shoots great photos in better lighting conditions. Video capture from the rear camera is fantastic, and easy to use, arguably better than rivals. The front-facing camera can also offers slow-motion selfies, which kids will love. Overall the camera on the iPhone 11 is a big step up, equalling or exceeding rivals from the first half of 2019 in the most important features, although the lack of an optical zoom is disappointing. Observations The iPhone 11 is water resistant to IP68 standards of up to 2 metres for 30 seconds, which is 1 metre deeper than last year\u2019s iPhone XR Bluetooth performance is much improved, with stronger connections to even the weakest of headphones The volume slider shows you a bespoke icon of the headphones you are wearing \u2013 if they are made by Apple You can swipe to type on Apple\u2019s default keyboard in iOS 13 Face ID is still best-in-class, now slightly faster and works at slightly wider angles The new U1 chip enables enhanced location abilities, but so far it\u2019s only used for directional AirDrop file sharing, which will be most useful for narrowing down which iPhone you want to send a file to in a cluster of iPhones \u2013 not something I do very often Price The iPhone 11 costs \u00a3729 for 64GB of storage, \u00a3779 for 128GB or \u00a3879 for 256GB, and is available in white, black, green, yellow, purple or red. For comparison, the iPhone XR costs \u00a3629, the OnePlus 7 costs \u00a3499, the Samsung S10e costs \u00a3669, the Honor 20 Pro costs \u00a3550, the iPhone 11 Pro costs \u00a31,049 and the iPhone 11 Pro Max costs \u00a31,149. Verdict The iPhone 11 is an excellent but boring smartphone. It\u2019s got a three-year-old design, which Apple broke the mould with in 2017 when it launched the iPhone X but now looks dated against the competition, particularly with the thicker bezels on the LCD screen. Things have moved on in the era of the all-screen smartphone. It\u2019s fairly large, heavy and difficult to grip and use with one hand, but is also extremely well made and feels solid. These are all attributes shared by its predecessor the iPhone XR, as the iPhone 11 is essentially new guts in last year\u2019s design. At \u00a3729 the iPhone 11 isn\u2019t exactly cheap, costing the same as the top-of-the-line phones from competitors. But what you get for your \u00a3729 is Apple\u2019s latest top-of-the-range processor with performance to match. Battery life that will easily see you into a second day, maybe a third if you\u2019re careful. Camera performance that is up there with the very best, but lacking an optical zoom, replaced instead by a fun ultra-wide angle camera. You also get five years of software updates, which can\u2019t be sniffed at. With a battery swap at some point there\u2019s no reason an iPhone 11 won\u2019t last you five years if you\u2019re careful with it. In some tests the glass appears fairly tough to break, but less so in others, so whether it will survive real-world drops remains to be seen. So the iPhone 11 is the iPhone for people who don\u2019t really care about smartphones and just want a new iPhone. Except that it\u2019s not that simple. Apple still sells the iPhone XR, which is essentially the same phone minus a second camera and one year less of software support, which is still at least four years, for \u00a3100 less at \u00a3629. And then there\u2019s the iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max, which have a third camera, a significantly better screen and the cachet of being \u201cthe best iPhone\u201d. If your primary driver is to buy the best, cheapest iPhone you can get, that\u2019s the iPhone XR in 2019. If you want the best iPhone you can get, that\u2019s one of the new iPhone 11 Pro line. So where does that leave the iPhone 11? Pros: great camera, night mode water resistant, wireless charging, Face ID, good battery life, good performance, good screen, long software support Cons: no headphone socket, no fingerprint scanner, dated design, expensive, no fast charger or USB-C cable in the box, no headphones adapter in the box Other reviews Best smartphone 2019: iPhone, OnePlus, Samsung and Huawei compared and ranked Samsung Galaxy S10 review: the sweet spot Samsung Galaxy S10e review: the cheaper one OnePlus 7 review: competition-beating performance for less OnePlus 7 Pro review: an absolute beast in every way",

Old, male intellectuals in France have been farting on because she is not \u201csexy\u201d enough. Yes, really. The 84-year-old philosopher Bernard Pivot, the president of the Acad\u00e9mie Goncourt, a French literary society, talked of the sexy Swedish girls of his youth. Greta does not match up, apparently. Michel Onfray, 60, another philosopher, said she has the age and body of a cyborg. Pascal Bruckner, 70, said her face was \u201cscary\u201d and that she flaunts her autism. Trump, as we know, has mocked her.</p> <p>She is a 16-year-old, and these are grown men. And they are terrified. Wonderful. Who knew you could shake the patriarchy simply by refusing to smile for it, dress for it or demur to it?

      "bodyText": "Sometimes you don\u2019t realise how conditioned you are until you meet someone who isn\u2019t. Sure, I may be blunt in my work, but I still say sorry when someone barges into me in the street. I smile when others are being difficult. After all, I am of a certain age, and was brought up, consciously or not, to be a people-pleaser. In the 80s, I stood hesitantly outside an assertiveness training class \u2013 feminists used to do lots of stuff like that \u2013 unsure whether to knock or not, as I was five minutes late. As I have got older, I please myself far more and everyone else far less. And I often look to younger women for guidance. The extraordinary reactions of certain men to Greta Thunberg, which have nothing to do with her urgent and necessary message on the climate emergency, tells you exactly what happens when a young woman simply refuses to be sexualised. It makes them deeply uncomfortable. Thunberg\u2019s manner may be associated with her Asperger\u2019s, but her defiance unsettles them. Old, male intellectuals in France have been farting on because she is not \u201csexy\u201d enough. Yes, really. The 84-year-old philosopher Bernard Pivot, the president of the Acad\u00e9mie Goncourt, a French literary society, talked of the sexy Swedish girls of his youth. Greta does not match up, apparently. Michel Onfray, 60, another philosopher, said she has the age and body of a cyborg. Pascal Bruckner, 70, said her face was \u201cscary\u201d and that she flaunts her autism. Trump, as we know, has mocked her. She is a 16-year-old, and these are grown men. And they are terrified. Wonderful. Who knew you could shake the patriarchy simply by refusing to smile for it, dress for it or demur to it? A refusal to acquiesce to the male gaze has these dinosaurs squirming. Greta, you teach us about more than one kind of climate. Thank you. \u2022 Suzanne Moore is a Guardian columnist",

Join chair Zoe Williams and our panel of Guardian writers including chief leader writer Randeep Ramesh; Lisa O\u2019Carroll, Brexit correspondent; and Rowena Mason, deputy political editor, as they discuss the unfolding Brexit chaos. Top stories The last week began with a bombshell when the 11 judges of the supreme court ruled unanimously that Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament for five weeks at the height of the Brexit crisis was \u201cunlawful, void and of no effect\u201d. In an clear decision asserting the supremacy of parliament over government, the court said the prime minister\u2019s move \u201chad the effect of frustrating or preventing the ability of parliament to carry out its constitutional functions without reasonable justification\u201d. Johnson, who was in New York for a UN meeting, said he \u201cdisagreed\u201d with the judges\u2019 opinion and suggested he may try to send MPs home once again. He then cut short his stay and flew back to Britain to face the fury of a reconvened parliament. During a highly acrimonious session in the Commons, the prime minister subsequently caused outrage by dismissing calls to stop using inflammatory terms such as \u201csurrender\u201d, \u201ctraitor\u201d and \u201cbetrayal\u201d in relation to Brexit, saying the best way to honour the memory of murdered MP Jo Cox was to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d. Despite thinly-veiled criticism from Church of England bishops, his sister Rachel, Amber Rudd (who said his rhetoric legitimised violence) and many others, Johnson passed up multiple opportunities to apologise, repeatedly refusing to say sorry. No 10 promised Johnson would not be toning down his language at the Conservative party conference either and his adviser Dominic Cummings insisted the only way threats and abuse would be stopped was if MPs \u201crespect\u201d the result of the EU referendum. Many MPs are convinced Johnson\u2019s choice of language is a deliberate effort to whip up anger in the country against them in order to motivate pro-Brexit voters to back him; the Speaker, John Bercow, summoned all party leaders to peace talks. Meanwhile, opposition MPs flexed their muscles again, rejecting the government\u2019s call for a mini-recess for the Conservative conference and discussing plans to force Johnson to request a Brexit extension earlier than the current 19 October deadline. Amid fears Johnson might try to invoke emergency powers or simply ignore the Benn act obliging him to seek a Brexit extension beyond 31 October, a cross-party group of MPs planned to seize control of parliament to strengthen legislation against a no deal. On the EU side, Ireland\u2019s Leo Varadkar said the UK must table written proposals on how it plans to replicate the Northern Ireland backstop within the week. Jean-Claude Juncker said responsibility for no deal would rest solely with the UK and Michel Barnier added that Johnson\u2019s antics had \u201climited the chance\u201d of a deal. The early stages of the Tory conference in Manchester were dominated by discussion of allegations that Johnson groped a journalist\u2019s inner thigh at a dinner. And despite it all, a new poll showed the Conservatives hold a 12-point lead over Labour. What next The formal exit date of 31 October can only be observed if Johnson agrees a new deal with the EU, which is then approved by parliament; the Benn act obliges him to write to the EU seeking a new extension if no deal has been reached by the 19 October. However, it is highly unlikely a deal could be reached at the EU summit on 17 and 18 October, and any agreement would in any case require the improbable Commons support of ex-Tories stripped of the party whip and some Labour rebels. The prime minister has said repeatedly he will abide by the law, but also that he will not seek an extension. He has not said how he will square that circle. So what might happen? There has been speculation he could declare an emergency using the 2004 Civil Contingencies Act or write a \u201csecond letter\u201d to the EU revoking the first, both of which would be open to legal challenge. Alternatively, he could resign in order to pose as a Brexit martyr or \u2013 perhaps most likely, but not immediately \u2013 be ousted in a vote of no confidence, allowing a caretaker prime minister to ask Brussels for the delay and dissolve parliament.

In the 1960s, one teacher, Eva Fulleylove, who taught ex-secondary modern teenagers at a technical college, said acting in A Taste of Honey helped them overcome their \u201csense of academic inferiority and feeling of unimportance.\u201d Exam grades don\u2019t do justice to such responses.</p> <p>But, as many teachers have long understood, art doesn\u2019t only resonate with us if it mirrors our lives. Fulleylove\u2019s students studied Honey alongside The Diary of Anne Frank and the works of Shakespeare \u2013 set texts in comprehensives between the 1970s and the 2010s. Delaney would have approved. \u201cThe working classes in the gallery have supported the British theatre ever since Elizabethan times,\u201d she said. \u201cGive them good plays and they will go to the theatre.\u201d</p> <p>The arts encourage us to believe we can change the world for the better - perhaps too worrying for a rightwing government.

That lesson still applies today. Whether treated as a \u201csoft\u201d subject or the preserve of an elite, the arts are not where they should be in our education system: centre stage.</p>",

The Ebacc, introduced by Michael Gove to promote certain favoured subjects, deters creative studies. The arts are the poor relation of \u201creal\u201d education \u2013 defined by government since 2010 as memorising quotations, formulae and dates. Students who struggle are encouraged to focus on vocational skills most prominently in the new T-levels. Neither route develops imagination and initiative. That is a particularly urgent problem now. The challenges of automation, climate change and, yes, life beyond Brexit, require innovation and critical thinking. We\u2019ll need everyone to play a part if we are to save the world \u2013 and arts education is crucial. Delaney\u2019s life shows that artistic education benefits everyone. In 1949 she failed the 11-plus, which, like every other intelligence test, assessed social class rather than brainpower. Fortunately, a visionary teacher at her secondary modern school recognised that her pupils deserved to experience the arts. When she invited Delaney to a school performance of Othello, it made a great impression. But even inspiring teachers cannot overcome a limited curriculum and underfunding. For this reason, Delaney\u2019s teachers pushed for her transfer to a grammar school \u2013 but when she got there she discovered that an \u201cacademic\u201d education meant rote learning. She left for a series of factory and shop jobs. She owed her big break to her maverick teacher, and to Labour\u2019s postwar investment in the arts and libraries \u2013 she was encouraged to write by the council-funded Manchester Library Theatre. Since 1958, generations of theatregoers, teachers and students have been inspired by Delaney\u2019s debut play. Their enthusiasm refutes Tory politicians\u2019 narrow definition of \u201cgreat\u201d literature. In the 1960s, one teacher, Eva Fulleylove, who taught ex-secondary modern teenagers at a technical college, said acting in A Taste of Honey helped them overcome their \u201csense of academic inferiority and feeling of unimportance.\u201d Exam grades don\u2019t do justice to such responses. But, as many teachers have long understood, art doesn\u2019t only resonate with us if it mirrors our lives. Fulleylove\u2019s students studied Honey alongside The Diary of Anne Frank and the works of Shakespeare \u2013 set texts in comprehensives between the 1970s and the 2010s. Delaney would have approved. \u201cThe working classes in the gallery have supported the British theatre ever since Elizabethan times,\u201d she said. \u201cGive them good plays and they will go to the theatre.\u201d The arts encourage us to believe we can change the world for the better - perhaps too worrying for a rightwing government. They help us to understand those different from us, and to identify common ground. They dare us to dream of a different future. Delaney was adamant that she was \u201cnot a native genius\u201d. Imagine, she suggested, how enriched Britain would be if everyone had her luck. That lesson still applies today. Whether treated as a \u201csoft\u201d subject or the preserve of an elite, the arts are not where they should be in our education system: centre stage.",

To say that you have slept in such situations is stretching it: ill-thought-out manoeuvres in the dark left us all exhausted by morning. This stage where thoughts, hours and bodies merged into one another seemed to go on for ever, metastasising in a fuzziness that left me vague and useless for days at a time.</p> <p>Newly separated and the only adult in the house, I had to look after myself if I wanted to look after the children. I started to discover things that felt good and that didn\u2019t require cash, dating apps or a babysitter: a long bath; reading the papers in bed; and most important of all, sleep. I don\u2019t know how much of my love for my bed comes from the sleep or the new-found solitude in bed after a day of being surrounded by people. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/dec/11/the-bedroom-by-michelle-perrot-review-an-intimate-history\" title=\"\">But it is the only place I can</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/dec/11/the-bedroom-by-michelle-perrot-review-an-intimate-history\" title=\"\"> go that is exclusively mine</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>While I enjoy the warmth of my boyfriend's body next to mine, the waking up together in the morning is so much better than the actual sleep.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There are exceptions when I do share a bed, or sleep elsewhere. Who doesn\u2019t love the heft, bounce and wedge of a luxury hotel mattress, dressed in white, starchy sheets that have been washed by someone else?</p> <p>Occasionally, I will stay the night at my boyfriend\u2019s place. Having sex is something we enjoy more than sharing a bed, though, which is no problem because we\u2019re neighbours; we can almost hear each other breathe through the wall that separates our respective bedrooms.</p> <p>When I can\u2019t be bothered to schlep the 30 steps home, I stay put. While I enjoy the warmth of his body next to mine, waking up together in the morning is so much better than the actual sleep.</p> <p>What I\u2019ve learned from this relationship is that sex and sleeping in the same bed are not synonymous. My boyfriend and I are not cuddle-up-close types, anyway, and we both agree that we have deeper, longer sleeps on our own, free to move limbs this way and that and to claim all of the covers.</p> <p>On the occasions that I\u2019ve lain awake next to a sleeping body at 3am, my loneliness is far more acute than when I am on my own. At least then I can switch on the light to read, without worrying about waking my bed partner. I have a far greater chance of staying sane when I have seven or eight undisturbed hours under my belt. And for now, that sleep feels far more attainable when I\u2019m alone.</p>",

One of the biggest surprises of our split has been that having my own bed contributes to a large part of that happiness. One day, I may live with someone again, and we probably won\u2019t have enough space or money to have our own bedrooms. I may learn to love the peeling clingfilm sensation of bodies parting in summer (although I can\u2019t imagine that I will). But, for now, I know there is a stretch of undisturbed hours waiting for me every night; there are lazy Sunday mornings when my children might not bring me a cup of coffee, but they won\u2019t disturb me before 10am, because I\u2019ve told them not to. When my bedroom door is shut, I can sack off sacrificing, do away with sharing, forget about anyone but myself. Of course, waking up in my king-size bed alone for the first time didn\u2019t trigger a spiritual awakening, or a moment of rapture. The joy of sleeping alone revealed itself more slowly, like the cautious removal of the winter duvet when spring arrives, a familiar warmth kissing the skin. Soon I was enjoying a succession of dead-to-the-world sleeps, unconscious from the moment of switching off my bedside lamp to the alarm razor-blading the morning air. I hadn\u2019t slept so well since my teens. I thought: is this how some people feel all the time? I\u2019ve shared my bed with someone for longer than I have not. Before marriage, I had always had a boyfriend, and we usually lived together. I was a young mother and my daughter and I slept together in our one-bed flat. I married and had two more kids. My husband and I often woke with a small, sweaty child between us. To say that you have slept in such situations is stretching it: ill-thought-out manoeuvres in the dark left us all exhausted by morning. This stage where thoughts, hours and bodies merged into one another seemed to go on for ever, metastasising in a fuzziness that left me vague and useless for days at a time. Newly separated and the only adult in the house, I had to look after myself if I wanted to look after the children. I started to discover things that felt good and that didn\u2019t require cash, dating apps or a babysitter: a long bath; reading the papers in bed; and most important of all, sleep. I don\u2019t know how much of my love for my bed comes from the sleep or the new-found solitude in bed after a day of being surrounded by people. But it is the only place I can go that is exclusively mine. There are exceptions when I do share a bed, or sleep elsewhere. Who doesn\u2019t love the heft, bounce and wedge of a luxury hotel mattress, dressed in white, starchy sheets that have been washed by someone else? Occasionally, I will stay the night at my boyfriend\u2019s place. Having sex is something we enjoy more than sharing a bed, though, which is no problem because we\u2019re neighbours; we can almost hear each other breathe through the wall that separates our respective bedrooms. When I can\u2019t be bothered to schlep the 30 steps home, I stay put. While I enjoy the warmth of his body next to mine, waking up together in the morning is so much better than the actual sleep. What I\u2019ve learned from this relationship is that sex and sleeping in the same bed are not synonymous. My boyfriend and I are not cuddle-up-close types, anyway, and we both agree that we have deeper, longer sleeps on our own, free to move limbs this way and that and to claim all of the covers. On the occasions that I\u2019ve lain awake next to a sleeping body at 3am, my loneliness is far more acute than when I am on my own. At least then I can switch on the light to read, without worrying about waking my bed partner. I have a far greater chance of staying sane when I have seven or eight undisturbed hours under my belt. And for now, that sleep feels far more attainable when I\u2019m alone.",

Both men participated in contacts between Trump and leaders of at least four foreign countries, aimed at producing stories that could damage the president\u2019s likely 2020 opponent, Joe Biden, or undermine the Russia-Mueller probe. Pompeo is also reported to have taken part in Trump\u2019s now infamous call with the Ukrainian president that set off the impeachment inquiry and Barr flew to London and Italy to ask for help in \u201cinvestigating\u201d the roots of the Russia investigation, the Washington Post reported. Meanwhile it emerged that Trump himself asked Australia\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison, for help in discrediting the Mueller inquiry into 2016 election tampering, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/01/donald-trump-urged-scott-morrison-help-discredit-mueller-inquiry\">and Morrison agreed</a>.

Both men participated in contacts between Trump and leaders of at least four foreign countries, aimed at producing stories that could damage the president\u2019s likely 2020 opponent, Joe Biden, or undermine the Russia-Mueller probe. Pompeo is also reported to have taken part in Trump\u2019s now infamous call with the Ukrainian president that set off the impeachment inquiry and Barr flew to London and Italy to ask for help in \u201cinvestigating\u201d the roots of the Russia investigation, the Washington Post reported. Meanwhile it emerged that Trump himself asked Australia\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison, for help in discrediting the Mueller inquiry into 2016 election tampering, and Morrison agreed. The developments came after Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudi Guiliani, was subpoenaed by House congressional committees to produce documents related to his and Trump\u2019s alleged attempt to coerce Ukraine into investigating Biden and his son. * * * \u2018Great nation\u2019 \u2013 China has held a massive military parade to mark the 70th anniversary of Communist rule. Addressing crowds from Tiananmen Square, president Xi Jinping led tributes to \u201crevolutionary heroes and martyrs\u201d and said no force could \u201cshake this great nation\u201d. In reference to Taiwan, Xi said Beijing would \u201ccontinue to strive for the complete reunification of our country\u201d. On Hong Kong, he said China must remain \u201ccommitted to the strategy of peaceful reunification and one country, two systems\u201d. Shortly after his speech, pro-democracy crowds began gathering in Hong Kong for what are expected to be large protests. * * * Doctors at risk \u2013 One in five doctors has been sexually harassed or witnessed sexual harassment at work, a survey has revealed. Harassment of medics includes explicit text messages or emails, being groped, propositioned or repeatedly asked to go on a date. The perpetrators are mostly patients (17%) but sometimes fellow medics or nurses (3%), according to a survey of 1,378 hospital doctors and GPs. In one in eight incidents involving patients, doctors were asked to meet for a sexual encounter. * * * Antarctic break off \u2013 An iceberg the size of Greater London has calved off the Amery ice shelf in east Antarctica. Scientists say it is not connected to climate change, but is part of the normal process of the continent\u2019s evolution, where ice thins out at the very edge of shelves, sitting on top of water instead of being attached all the way to the ocean floor. According to Ben Galton-Fenzi, a glaciologist with the Australian Antarctic Program, the calving won\u2019t directly affect sea levels \u201cbecause the ice shelf was already floating, much like an ice cube in a glass of water\u201d. Today in Focus podcast: Could this impeachment inquiry end Trump\u2019s presidency? In a July phone call between US president Donald Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Trump asked Zelenskiy to investigate former vice president Joe Biden. An intelligence official decided to blow the whistle on the call. Lauren Gambino discusses how this has led to an impeachment inquiry. And: Joseph Harker on the start of Black History Month. Lunchtime read: Debbie Harry on heroin, rape, robbery Few women have been objectified as much as Debbie Harry. In her Blondie memoir, Face It, she reveals her addiction, a brutal robbery-turned-assault and why she still feels lucky. In the 1970s after a gig she and her boyfriend (and Blondie co-founder, Chris Stein) were held at knifepoint in their apartment by a man looking for drugs, who tied her up and raped her. She didn\u2019t let it define her. \u201cI had to consider what was important to me, and being a victim was really not who I wanted to be.\u201d Perhaps minimising it has helped protect her from it? She smiles. \u201cYeah. Absolutely.\u201d Her biggest mistake in her life, she says, was money. \u201cThat I didn\u2019t pay more attention to business, and that I was really only interested in making music and performing.\u201d In the 80s she and Stein lost everything. Their 1976 debut album, the eponymous Blondie, saw them tour the world for years, but they lost their New York townhouse and the IRS even took some of her clothes. Heroin was a big part of their lives , but she she got off it \u201cjust the way anybody does \u2013 go to a programme, or go into therapy. It\u2019s not easy.\u201d At 74, how does she feel about getting older? \u201cIt sucks,\u201d she says with a laugh. There isn\u2019t much she would have done differently in her life, she says. \u201cWe all make mistakes, but the thing is to learn from them. And make different mistakes.\u201d Sport The US Anti-Doping Agency has banned American Alberto Salazar, who has coached some of the world\u2019s top distance runners including British Olympian track champion Mo Farah, for four years for doping violations. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r insisted he was still confident of Manchester United having a successful year after a 1-1 draw with Arsenal condemned the 20-times Premier League champions to their worst start to a season for 30 years. Dina Asher-Smith insists she is not feeling the pressure to follow her 100m silver with a 200m world title \u2013 despite finishing fastest of all in the first round in Doha. The championships, blighted by small crowds, have so far been a PR disaster for athletics, for the sport\u2019s president, Sebastian Coe, and for Qatar, writes Sean Ingle. England are backing their forward \u201ctank\u201d to propel them past Argentina this weekend and confirm their place in the last eight of the Rugby World Cup. Ardie Savea will make a small slice of history when he runs out for the All Blacks against Canada on Wednesday to become the first player to wear goggles in a World Cup match, a move the New Zealand forward says could save him from going blind. And it took nine-year-old Kade Lovell longer than expected to finish his 5km race in Minnesota, but only because he was busy accidentally winning a separate 10km event. Business The shared workspace operator WeWork has pulled plans for a share sale after ousting its founder and amid investor scepticism over its sky-high valuation. The decision leaves the rental company facing a cash crunch as its new bosses prepare to make deep cuts to stem its massive losses. WeWork had planned to start an investor roadshow earlier this month before an IPO. But the company, which had been valued at $47bn earlier this year, found investors worried by its valuation and by corporate governance issues. It was forced to slash its valuation by more than half. The pound is buying $1.229 and \u20ac1.128. The papers The papers devote plenty of space to Boris Johnson again today. The Telegraph leads with \u201cJohnson to reveal his Brexit plan\u201d to EU leaders in the next day or so. The paper says his alternative to the Irish backstop is an \u201call-Ireland economic zone\u201d. The Times has \u201cBlock Brexit delay, says Johnson\u201d, which says the PM has asked the EU to rule out an extension of Article 50. The Guardian has \u201cMinisters defend PM on groping allegations\u201d (but reserves its splash for \u201cBBC caves in over censure of TV presenter in Trump racism row\u201d). The Mirror splashes on what it calls a \u201cnew bombshell\u201d, with a headline referring to US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri: \u201cBoris\u2019 \u2018lover\u2019 in fear over her stolen laptop\u201d. The i reports \u201cGovernment of national unity \u2013 talks begin\u201d over a picture of Jo Swinson, Jeremy Corbyn and Nicola Sturgeon. The FT has \u201cJohnson to \u2018know by the weekend\u2019 whether he has chance of Brexit deal\u201d, (but reserves its lead for \u201cRiyadh woos Aramco investors by dangling $75bn yearly payout\u201d, a reference to the Saudi state-owned energy group). The Express ignores Brexit with a story about the home secretary, Pritti Patel, pledging a crackdown on crime: \u201cCriminals we are coming after you\u201d is its headline. The Mail also splashes on that story, with \u201cEnd of the soft prison sentence\u201d. The Sun appeals to those sitting down to breakfast: \u201cBacon\u2019s safe \u2026 No ifs or butties\u201d, citing Canadian research that bacon and other processed meats are safe.

      "body": "<p>It wasn\u2019t until she was 31 \u2013 relatively old by pop-star standards \u2013 that Debbie Harry became famous. This goes some way to explain how she managed to cram in so much before she became the superstar frontwoman of Blondie. To name but a few of her experiences, as a child, she survived being in a coma as a result of pneumonia; as a young woman in New York, she worked for the BBC, hung out with Andy Warhol and other New York faces, escaped an abusive relationship, became a driver for the New York Dolls, started a girl band, formed Blondie and believes she had a lucky escape from the serial killer Ted Bundy. \u201cI\u2019m sure I don\u2019t have all my experiences on tap,\u201d Harry writes in her new autobiography, Face It.</p> <p>I meet her in a suite at the Savoy in London. She appears alone, wearing sunglasses. Harry is tiny (despite her platform trainers) and pale, with her instantly recognisable peroxide hair swept back. She looks as delicate and ethereal as a dandelion clock, but the sunglasses come off and her eyes are quick and determined. She seems warm and tries to ask me as many questions as I ask her \u2013 I can\u2019t decide if it is her enduring curiosity or a deflection technique.

She recalls, with a laugh, that security came to interrogate them because of Stein\u2019s collection of ceremonial weapons.</p> <p>She seems to have stories about everything, which makes Face It an often very funny read. Was it sometimes difficult looking back? Harry is 74, and has been through some traumatic events. \u201cSometimes, yeah. It wasn\u2019t something \u2026\u201d She pauses. \u201cI tend to move on, get interested in something and see what\u2019s about. I guess there were moments when I thought: \u2018God, you were such a fool.\u2019 You look back, and you think about all the mistakes you made: \u2018Why did I ever do that?\u2019\u201d She smiles. \u201cBut, all in all, I guess I\u2019ve been very lucky.\u201d</p> <p>Her biggest mistake, she says, was money. \u201cThat I didn\u2019t pay more attention to business, and that I was really only interested in making music and performing.\u201d</p> <p>In the early 80s, Harry and Stein \u2013 they were in a relationship for 13 years \u2013 lost everything. Their debut album, the eponymous Blondie, came out in 1976, and for years they toured the world; they had six No 1 UK hits, including Heart of Glass and Call Me, and sold 40m records.<strong> </strong>When the US Internal Revenue Service hit them with a huge bill for unpaid tax,<strong> </strong>they lost their New York townhouse; the IRS even took some of her clothes, she writes. Worse, Stein was in hospital recovering from an autoimmune disease \u2013 Harry would spend the next few years looking after him \u2013 and they were not sure how they would pay his medical bills. It also meant the end of the band.</p> <p>At the time, they were both on heroin. In her book, Harry, who would bring the drug to Stein in hospital, writes: \u201cI think that doctors and nurses knew that he was high all the time, but cast a blind eye because it kept him relatively pain-free and mentally less tortured.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6b30cb750b48c770fbea4e11c9b869e5c27383d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b30cb750b48c770fbea4e11c9b869e5c27383d5/0_0_4008_2672/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harry with Andy Warhol in 1985.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harry with Andy Warhol in 1985.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sipa/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Harry had first tried heroin with an old boyfriend, but judging by old interviews it doesn\u2019t seem to have been a problem for her. How would she describe her relationship with it? \u201cI don\u2019t actually regret taking it, but I do regret the amount of time \u2026 it\u2019s a time-consumer. But I think at that point it was a necessary evil. To some degree, it was self-medicating. It was a rough, depressing time of life and it seemed to suit the purpose, but then it outlived its benefits.\u201d</p> <p>She got off it, she says matter-of-factly, \u201cjust the way anybody does \u2013 go to a programme, or go into therapy. It\u2019s not easy.\u201d Her eyes widen and she changes tack. (She does this a lot.) \u201cNow, the whole opioid crisis [in the US] is even more serious,\u201d she says. Her aunt became addicted to painkillers. \u201cShe was a little bit older than I am today when she had this problem. It was hard for her to get off of all this.\u201d</p> <p>Harry, who was adopted as a baby, grew up in small-town New Jersey. She writes movingly about how a fear of abandonment has lasted all her life: \u201cI guess somewhere in my subconscious, a scene was playing on a loop of a parent leaving me somewhere and never coming back.\u201d</p> <p>Was it painful to revisit that in her book? \u201cNot at this point in my life because I\u2019m an adult. I think we all have a little area of clutter that\u2019s nagging sometimes and it\u2019s often hard to get rid of. Maybe this is my purge.\u201d Did it feel cathartic? \u201cWell, you know,\u201d she says with a sigh, \u201cI think I\u2019ve solved a lot of those problems that were hanging on and I\u2019m glad it\u2019s sort of done.\u201d</p> <p>She spent a few years in New York after college, waitressing, failing at auditions and playing in bands. It wasn\u2019t working out, so she moved back to New Jersey and started a relationship with a man who was possessive and controlling; one night he broke into her flat, thinking she had another man there, put a gun to her head and threatened to rape her. \u201cThat was crazy, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d she says. She denies it had much of a lasting impact. \u201cI was just happy to get away from him and move on with my life. Fortunately, that\u2019s when I met Chris, so that was one of the best things in my life, if not the very best. We\u2019ve had a long run of great friendship and creative success so, my God, I can\u2019t ask for more.\u201d</p> <p>She is similarly dismissive of another horrific incident. In the early 70s, when she and Stein were coming home after a gig, a man followed them and forced them at knifepoint to let him into their apartment. He was looking for drugs and equipment. He tied up Stein, then Harry. Once he had piled up the equipment he was going to take \u2013 guitars, Stein\u2019s camera \u2013 he raped her on the bed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"54b5a505fbf51a511a2720c64d8593a86871a63e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54b5a505fbf51a511a2720c64d8593a86871a63e/0_0_3307_2415/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harry and Stein in New York in 1978.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"730\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harry and Stein in New York in 1978.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roberta Bayley/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In her book, she writes: \u201cI can\u2019t say that I felt a lot of fear.

Absolutely.\u201d</p> <p>Few women have been objectified as much as Harry. Her face \u2013 those killer cheekbones and heart-shaped mouth \u2013 is immortalised on Blondie album covers and in Warhol\u2019s famous portrait.

But later, when I ask her when she was the happiest, she says: \u201cI\u2019m pretty happy now.\u201d</p> <p>There was a time, just after 9/11, which she watched unfold from the window of her apartment, when she longed for the 70s. \u201cYou look back and everything looks a little bit rosier, but it was a good time. It was a good time to be a young person.\u201d And to be an artist because you could afford to live in pre-gentrified New York? \u201cAll of that,\u201d she says. \u201cEverybody in the 70s was living in squats and everything; it was kind of romantic.\u201d</p> <p>She has outlived many of her friends and the New York characters who populate her book, such as David Bowie, Warhol and Joey Ramone. \u201cThere have been times when I\u2019ve had to face mortality and, as a person with strong survival instincts, I\u2019m blessed in that way,\u201d she says. Her numerous brushes with death include accepting a lift at about 2am in New York, from a man she believes was the serial killer Ted Bundy (people have said Bundy wasn\u2019t in New York at that time, but she is convinced it was him). \u201cI know that I\u2019m really lucky and the longer I live, the more I know it, so it has led me to do things that are not about myself,\u201d she says.

      "bodyText": "It wasn\u2019t until she was 31 \u2013 relatively old by pop-star standards \u2013 that Debbie Harry became famous. This goes some way to explain how she managed to cram in so much before she became the superstar frontwoman of Blondie. To name but a few of her experiences, as a child, she survived being in a coma as a result of pneumonia; as a young woman in New York, she worked for the BBC, hung out with Andy Warhol and other New York faces, escaped an abusive relationship, became a driver for the New York Dolls, started a girl band, formed Blondie and believes she had a lucky escape from the serial killer Ted Bundy. \u201cI\u2019m sure I don\u2019t have all my experiences on tap,\u201d Harry writes in her new autobiography, Face It. I meet her in a suite at the Savoy in London. She appears alone, wearing sunglasses. Harry is tiny (despite her platform trainers) and pale, with her instantly recognisable peroxide hair swept back. She looks as delicate and ethereal as a dandelion clock, but the sunglasses come off and her eyes are quick and determined. She seems warm and tries to ask me as many questions as I ask her \u2013 I can\u2019t decide if it is her enduring curiosity or a deflection technique. Perhaps it is both. She remembers staying at the Savoy once with Chris Stein, her Blondie bandmate and then boyfriend, while Prince Charles and Diana were attending a party there. She recalls, with a laugh, that security came to interrogate them because of Stein\u2019s collection of ceremonial weapons. She seems to have stories about everything, which makes Face It an often very funny read. Was it sometimes difficult looking back? Harry is 74, and has been through some traumatic events. \u201cSometimes, yeah. It wasn\u2019t something \u2026\u201d She pauses. \u201cI tend to move on, get interested in something and see what\u2019s about. I guess there were moments when I thought: \u2018God, you were such a fool.\u2019 You look back, and you think about all the mistakes you made: \u2018Why did I ever do that?\u2019\u201d She smiles. \u201cBut, all in all, I guess I\u2019ve been very lucky.\u201d Her biggest mistake, she says, was money. \u201cThat I didn\u2019t pay more attention to business, and that I was really only interested in making music and performing.\u201d In the early 80s, Harry and Stein \u2013 they were in a relationship for 13 years \u2013 lost everything. Their debut album, the eponymous Blondie, came out in 1976, and for years they toured the world; they had six No 1 UK hits, including Heart of Glass and Call Me, and sold 40m records. When the US Internal Revenue Service hit them with a huge bill for unpaid tax, they lost their New York townhouse; the IRS even took some of her clothes, she writes. Worse, Stein was in hospital recovering from an autoimmune disease \u2013 Harry would spend the next few years looking after him \u2013 and they were not sure how they would pay his medical bills. It also meant the end of the band. At the time, they were both on heroin. In her book, Harry, who would bring the drug to Stein in hospital, writes: \u201cI think that doctors and nurses knew that he was high all the time, but cast a blind eye because it kept him relatively pain-free and mentally less tortured.\u201d Harry had first tried heroin with an old boyfriend, but judging by old interviews it doesn\u2019t seem to have been a problem for her. How would she describe her relationship with it? \u201cI don\u2019t actually regret taking it, but I do regret the amount of time \u2026 it\u2019s a time-consumer. But I think at that point it was a necessary evil. To some degree, it was self-medicating. It was a rough, depressing time of life and it seemed to suit the purpose, but then it outlived its benefits.\u201d She got off it, she says matter-of-factly, \u201cjust the way anybody does \u2013 go to a programme, or go into therapy. It\u2019s not easy.\u201d Her eyes widen and she changes tack. (She does this a lot.) \u201cNow, the whole opioid crisis [in the US] is even more serious,\u201d she says. Her aunt became addicted to painkillers. \u201cShe was a little bit older than I am today when she had this problem. It was hard for her to get off of all this.\u201d Harry, who was adopted as a baby, grew up in small-town New Jersey. She writes movingly about how a fear of abandonment has lasted all her life: \u201cI guess somewhere in my subconscious, a scene was playing on a loop of a parent leaving me somewhere and never coming back.\u201d Was it painful to revisit that in her book? \u201cNot at this point in my life because I\u2019m an adult. I think we all have a little area of clutter that\u2019s nagging sometimes and it\u2019s often hard to get rid of. Maybe this is my purge.\u201d Did it feel cathartic? \u201cWell, you know,\u201d she says with a sigh, \u201cI think I\u2019ve solved a lot of those problems that were hanging on and I\u2019m glad it\u2019s sort of done.\u201d She spent a few years in New York after college, waitressing, failing at auditions and playing in bands. It wasn\u2019t working out, so she moved back to New Jersey and started a relationship with a man who was possessive and controlling; one night he broke into her flat, thinking she had another man there, put a gun to her head and threatened to rape her. \u201cThat was crazy, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d she says. She denies it had much of a lasting impact. \u201cI was just happy to get away from him and move on with my life.

We\u2019ve had a long run of great friendship and creative success so, my God, I can\u2019t ask for more.\u201d She is similarly dismissive of another horrific incident. In the early 70s, when she and Stein were coming home after a gig, a man followed them and forced them at knifepoint to let him into their apartment. He was looking for drugs and equipment. He tied up Stein, then Harry. Once he had piled up the equipment he was going to take \u2013 guitars, Stein\u2019s camera \u2013 he raped her on the bed.

But later, when I ask her when she was the happiest, she says: \u201cI\u2019m pretty happy now.\u201d There was a time, just after 9/11, which she watched unfold from the window of her apartment, when she longed for the 70s. \u201cYou look back and everything looks a little bit rosier, but it was a good time. It was a good time to be a young person.\u201d And to be an artist because you could afford to live in pre-gentrified New York? \u201cAll of that,\u201d she says. \u201cEverybody in the 70s was living in squats and everything; it was kind of romantic.\u201d She has outlived many of her friends and the New York characters who populate her book, such as David Bowie, Warhol and Joey Ramone. \u201cThere have been times when I\u2019ve had to face mortality and, as a person with strong survival instincts, I\u2019m blessed in that way,\u201d she says. Her numerous brushes with death include accepting a lift at about 2am in New York, from a man she believes was the serial killer Ted Bundy (people have said Bundy wasn\u2019t in New York at that time, but she is convinced it was him). \u201cI know that I\u2019m really lucky and the longer I live, the more I know it, so it has led me to do things that are not about myself,\u201d she says. She is \u201creally concerned\u201d about environmental issues and despises Trump: \u201cBeing stuck with the administration we\u2019ve got now, and the lack of decency, is appalling to me.\u201d Harry is a survivor. There isn\u2019t much she would have done differently, she says. \u201cWe all make mistakes, but the thing is to learn from them. And make different mistakes.\u201d It is only recently, she says, that she has thought she might have liked to have had children (she is godmother to Stein\u2019s two daughters.) \u201cI sort of thought: \u2018Gee, maybe it wouldn\u2019t have been so bad to have kids.\u2019 But I don\u2019t know if I could have done it while I was working so much.\u201d Because she would have had to give up some of her freedoms? \u201cMy natural inclination is to really throw myself into things. It wouldn\u2019t be like I could hand over the baby. I would really want to be involved.\u201d She is still working, writing and touring. She would quite like to do \u201ca real serious role in film or in TV, but that\u2019s sort of wishful thinking\u201d. There may be another solo album at some point, and another book. She reaches into her bag and brings out two small notebooks \u2013 her \u201csnippet books\u201d, in which she writes ideas for songs, words and phrases. \u201cI\u2019m always coming up with ideas,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much longer I\u2019ll be working, but I enjoy it \u2013 it\u2019s my life, and people still want to see me.\u201d She says, not for the first time: \u201cI\u2019m very lucky, and I think I know it more and more.\u201d \u2022 Face It, published by HarperCollins, is out on 1 October, price \u00a320.

It is a few days before he travels to the UK to install his entry in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/turner-prize-2019\">the Turner prize show</a> in Margate, which will feature the work of three other finalists.

(It was nominated for the Turner prize last year.) Working with an architect, Abu Hamdan used the BBC and Warner Bros sound-effect libraries as prompts to help the witnesses summon up the sounds of, for example, doors shutting, locks turning and water dripping.</p> <p>There were more terrible noises to recall, too.

But it did express a deep truth: metaphorical truth, psychological truth. It is this that Abu Hamdan has excavated, in the three works he\u2019s presenting in Margate. The most substantial is a video called Walled Unwalled. Filmed in East Germany\u2019s old radio studios in East Berlin, it consists of Abu Hamdan reading a script about the Saydnaya witnesses\u2019 experiences, but also touches on other situations in which sounds heard through walls have been of profound importance. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/oscar-pistorius\">Oscar Pistorius</a> trial, for example, hinged partly on the defendant\u2019s claim that he believed he had heard an intruder, rather than his partner Reeva Steenkamp, behind the bathroom wall before he shot her.

They are also about the barriers nation states erect at their borders; the apparently boundary-free but highly surveilled world of the internet; how information leaks through the most impermeable-seeming walls; how what we hear is often deceptive and illusory. This is territory in which human experience can be best expressed not in forensic, journalistic or scientific language but in the language of art. \u201cI\u2019m quite romantic in thinking that art is a form of truth production, that a painting can manifest more of an essence of something than the thing itself,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7311b53238deea45bda38445aa37e278c7bb7859\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7311b53238deea45bda38445aa37e278c7bb7859/273_1154_5337_2731/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Earwitness Inventory \u2026 Abu Hamdan\u2019s assembled sound-effects kit on show in Beirut.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"512\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Earwitness Inventory \u2026 Abu Hamdan\u2019s assembled sound-effects kit on show in Beirut.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Agop Kanledjian/Courtesy the artist and Sfeir-Semler Gallery Beirut/Hamburg</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Beirut, I see some of his new work.

      "bodyText": "Three years ago, Lawrence Abu Hamdan spent a week in a room in Istanbul that would transform the way he understood the world. \u201cThe things I thought going in and coming out were completely different,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was a radical shift. That\u2019s why I made the works I have made.\u201d Abu Hamdan \u2013 34, neatly bearded, fashionably bespectacled \u2013 tells me this in Beirut, where he lives with his wife and daughter. It is a few days before he travels to the UK to install his entry in the Turner prize show in Margate, which will feature the work of three other finalists. We are in an office in the echoing, post-industrial Sfeir-Semler gallery, where many of his works, recent and not-so-recent, are on view until January. That week in 2016 he was working on a report for Amnesty International, interviewing six survivors from Saydnaya prison, 25km north of Damascus \u2013 a nightmarish black hole of abuse and torture, where 13,000 people are estimated to have been killed by Bashar Al-Assad\u2019s regime. Abu Hamdan\u2019s expertise is sound: he calls himself a \u201cprivate ear\u201d. He has made work about mishearings that lead to criminal cases, and about lie-detector technology. He was asking the survivors specifically about what they had heard in the prison. \u201cThe only way we can access much information about the site is through acoustic memories,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause people were blindfolded when they came in and held in darkness.\u201d Abu Hamdan was working alongside Forensic Architecture, an agency that uses architectural skills to investigate human rights abuses. (It was nominated for the Turner prize last year.) Working with an architect, Abu Hamdan used the BBC and Warner Bros sound-effect libraries as prompts to help the witnesses summon up the sounds of, for example, doors shutting, locks turning and water dripping. There were more terrible noises to recall, too. When someone was being beaten with a length of pipe, you could hear it, as the sounds reverberated around the building. At the same time, the prisoners were forced into silence on pain of execution: this was silence as a weapon. The inmates\u2019 hearing became so acute they could pick out the softest noises: the minute crack of lice being killed was like a sesame seed being crushed, said one witness. Crucially, the sound memories allowed Abu Hamdan and his colleague to build a picture of the prison, which they translated into a piece of 3D imaging that forms the centrepiece of the Amnesty report. \u201cOne prisoner had memorised how each lock sounded,\u201d says Abu Hamdan. \u201cSo he knew how many doors there were. Initially, that was a survival thing: he had to know where the guards were. But it helped us understand how many cells were in use. You could start corroborating it with other information to estimate how many people there were in the prison.\u201d The report did much to shed light on this dark and terrible place.

      "bodyText": "One of the UK\u2019s most dramatic gallery spaces, which displays the Raphael Cartoons, is to close temporarily to allow the first major refurbishment in more than 25 years. On Tuesday the Victoria and Albert Museum in London announced details of a project planned for most of 2020 which it said would allow visitors to see artworks which are considered among the greatest treasures of the Renaissance in more detail than ever before. The cartoons are designs commissioned in 1515 by Pope Leo X for a series of tapestries in the Sistine Chapel illustrating the lives of St Peter and St Paul. Seven of 10 survive and were brought to Britain in the 17th century by the Prince of Wales, later Charles I. They remained in the royal collection until Queen Victoria loaned them to the South Kensington Museum in 1865 in memory of Prince Albert. They have remained stars of the museum, now the V&amp;A, ever since. The gallery where they hang was originally designed for the museum\u2019s Indian art collection. In 1950 the cartoons were transferred there and it has proved \u201cthe perfect space\u201d said Ana Debenedetti, the lead curator of the Raphael Project. \u201cIt has almost the same dimensions as the Sistine Chapel, only 2 sq metres of difference. It is a dramatic gallery which allows a meditative feeling and this is really what we want to enhance.\u201d The Raphael Court was last refurbished between 1992-96 and a refresh was due, given that the natural lifecycle of such spaces is 25 years. The fact that 2020 is the the 500th anniversary of Raphael\u2019s death gave an added impetus. Debenedetti said the new gallery would have state-of-the art lighting and a darker colour on the walls to help focus visitors\u2019 eyes on the cartoons\u2019 vibrant palette. There will also be enhanced interpretation including high-definition, infrared and 3D scans of the cartoons. Because the cartoons cannot be moved the work will go on around them from 27 January, with the hope of being completed by October. That would coincide with a major show planned by the National Gallery to open on 3 October. Debenedetti said the seven cartoons, each measuring 5 metres wide and 3.5 metres high, were \u201ca unique Renaissance treasure, both in terms of aesthetic value and technical achievement\u201d.",

In July, the British Medical Association (BMA), the doctors trade union, commissioned an independent investigation into claims by two leading female GPs of sexism and sexual harassment by male colleagues.

He promises to take sovereignty back from the political elites \u2013 and return it to \u201cthe people\u201d. The announcement of these tactics has caused alarm among those who fear democracy will be threatened by a \u201cpopulist\u201d politics of polarisation between \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d.</p> <p>But this fear of populism reveals something troubling about how we currently understand democratic politics. What most people seem to find shocking about Johnson\u2019s strategy is that it involves an \u201cus v them\u201d confrontation \u2013 as if democratic politics could avoid conflict between irreconcilable political projects.</p> <p>Since Thucydides and Machiavelli, we have known that politics involves conflict and antagonism and that it has, by definition, a partisan character. In politics, therefore, we are always dealing with an opposition between \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d \u2013 which means it will always be necessary to draw a political frontier between the two sides.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2019/mar/06/revealed-the-rise-and-rise-of-populist-rhetoric\">Revealed: the rise and rise of populist rhetoric</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is still the case in a democracy: contrary to what is often asserted, democratic politics is not defined by the absence of such a frontier. In fact, what characterises a liberal pluralist democracy is the way this line is drawn \u2013 so that the \u201cthem\u201d are not seen as enemies to be destroyed, but as adversaries engaged in a confrontation between competing conceptions of the common good. When it is formulated in terms of an opposition between left and right \u2013 rather than in religious or ethnic terms \u2013 this frontier is crucial for democracy, because it provides the necessary framework for a confrontation between two legitimate positions.</p> <p>With the advent of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/feb/10/labour.uk1\" title=\"\">third way</a> in the 1990s, it became fashionable in some quarters to declare that the adversarial model of politics was now obsolete \u2013 so categories of right and left were no longer needed. But even the champions of a post-political consensus cannot avoid drawing a frontier between themselves and their rivals. Since they refuse to draw it in an adversarial way, they create a moral divide, which does not permit a true agonistic debate. Tony Blair pitted the modernisers against the traditionalists; for Emmanuel Macron, the frontier is between the progressives and the conservatives.</p> <p>As traditional social democratic parties were converted to neoliberalism in the 1990s and 2000s, this non-adversarial conception of politics \u2013 which was deemed to be progress for democracy \u2013 became dominant across western Europe. Centre-left parties convinced themselves there was no alternative to the hegemony of financial capitalism, and implemented the policies favoured by finance capital \u2013 which have led to an exponential increase in inequality and the emergence of new forms of subordination, not only among the working classes, but also in significant sectors of the middle classes.</p> <p>Since the economic crisis of 2008, however, there has been growing resistance to an economic order that has produced a new class of oligarchs and a growing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/15/cash-credits-and-crisis-life-in-the-new-european-precariat\" title=\"\">precariat</a>. After decades of \u201cpost-politics\u201d, during which citizens were deprived of a voice in the way they were governed \u2013 under the pretence there was no alternative \u2013 we are now living through a populist moment. Political frontiers that were said to have vanished are now being reinstated, in the name of recovering democracy and popular sovereignty.</p> <p>This is the context in which we must understand the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2018/nov/20/revealed-one-in-four-europeans-vote-populist\" title=\"\">recent success of rightwing populist parties</a>. By repudiating the centrist consensus, and redrawing a political frontier between \u201cthe people\u201d and \u201cthe establishment\u201d, they have promoted a challenge to the status quo that resonates with the feelings of many different constituencies who have been negatively affected by the consequences of neoliberal post-democracy.</p> <p>In Britain, much of this resistance was given shape by the Brexit vote in 2016. The great success of the leave campaign was to link the grievances of a number of disparate groups by articulating anti-austerity and anti-establishment sentiments with a nationalistic flavour. The slogan \u201cTake back control\u201d provided a rallying cry for these various demands. By blaming the EU for the deterioration of social and political conditions in the UK, Brexit became a hegemonic signifier \u2013 one around which a new \u201cpeople\u201d, identified as leavers, has coalesced. These are the \u201cpeople\u201d Johnson pretends to represent and whose will he accuses parliament of disregarding.</p> <p>How can we respond to such an offensive? We must not be tempted to counter Johnson\u2019s populism with a return to centrist politics. It is precisely such a centrist politics that is at the origin of the current democratic crisis in western Europe.</p> <p>Similarly, we should not demonise all Brexiters as deplorables, or dismiss them for being unable to recognise the intellectual and moral superiority of the European project. The campaign to leave succeeded in part because there was a democratic kernel at the core of these demands \u2013 which reflected a widespread discontent with post-democracy.</p> <p>In Britain, as in the rest of Europe, the way to answer the rightwing populist offensive is the construction of another \u201cpeople\u201d \u2013 through the articulation of a project that can link together various demands against the status quo. A project in which both leavers and remainers could feel that they have a voice and that their concerns are taken into account. One signifier for such a project could be a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/30/green-new-deal-climate-change-social-transformation\" title=\"\">Green New Deal</a> \u2013 which articulates multiple environmental and economic struggles around a demand for equality and social justice.</p> <p>To be sure, such an \u201cus\u201d will never include everybody. It does, of course, require a \u201cthem\u201d and the drawing of a political frontier. But we can have a frontier that makes democracy more radical \u2013 one that pits the people against the oligarchy, and the many against the few.</p> <p>\u2022 Chantal Mouffe is professor of political theory at the University of Westminster</p>",

      "bodyText": "In his determination to deliver Brexit \u201cdo or die\u201d, Boris Johnson is planning to launch an election campaign that will pit \u201cthe people\u201d against \u201cparliament\u201d. He promises to take sovereignty back from the political elites \u2013 and return it to \u201cthe people\u201d. The announcement of these tactics has caused alarm among those who fear democracy will be threatened by a \u201cpopulist\u201d politics of polarisation between \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d. But this fear of populism reveals something troubling about how we currently understand democratic politics. What most people seem to find shocking about Johnson\u2019s strategy is that it involves an \u201cus v them\u201d confrontation \u2013 as if democratic politics could avoid conflict between irreconcilable political projects. Since Thucydides and Machiavelli, we have known that politics involves conflict and antagonism and that it has, by definition, a partisan character. In politics, therefore, we are always dealing with an opposition between \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d \u2013 which means it will always be necessary to draw a political frontier between the two sides. This is still the case in a democracy: contrary to what is often asserted, democratic politics is not defined by the absence of such a frontier. In fact, what characterises a liberal pluralist democracy is the way this line is drawn \u2013 so that the \u201cthem\u201d are not seen as enemies to be destroyed, but as adversaries engaged in a confrontation between competing conceptions of the common good. When it is formulated in terms of an opposition between left and right \u2013 rather than in religious or ethnic terms \u2013 this frontier is crucial for democracy, because it provides the necessary framework for a confrontation between two legitimate positions. With the advent of the third way in the 1990s, it became fashionable in some quarters to declare that the adversarial model of politics was now obsolete \u2013 so categories of right and left were no longer needed. But even the champions of a post-political consensus cannot avoid drawing a frontier between themselves and their rivals. Since they refuse to draw it in an adversarial way, they create a moral divide, which does not permit a true agonistic debate. Tony Blair pitted the modernisers against the traditionalists; for Emmanuel Macron, the frontier is between the progressives and the conservatives. As traditional social democratic parties were converted to neoliberalism in the 1990s and 2000s, this non-adversarial conception of politics \u2013 which was deemed to be progress for democracy \u2013 became dominant across western Europe. Centre-left parties convinced themselves there was no alternative to the hegemony of financial capitalism, and implemented the policies favoured by finance capital \u2013 which have led to an exponential increase in inequality and the emergence of new forms of subordination, not only among the working classes, but also in significant sectors of the middle classes. Since the economic crisis of 2008, however, there has been growing resistance to an economic order that has produced a new class of oligarchs and a growing precariat. After decades of \u201cpost-politics\u201d, during which citizens were deprived of a voice in the way they were governed \u2013 under the pretence there was no alternative \u2013 we are now living through a populist moment. Political frontiers that were said to have vanished are now being reinstated, in the name of recovering democracy and popular sovereignty. This is the context in which we must understand the recent success of rightwing populist parties. By repudiating the centrist consensus, and redrawing a political frontier between \u201cthe people\u201d and \u201cthe establishment\u201d, they have promoted a challenge to the status quo that resonates with the feelings of many different constituencies who have been negatively affected by the consequences of neoliberal post-democracy. In Britain, much of this resistance was given shape by the Brexit vote in 2016. The great success of the leave campaign was to link the grievances of a number of disparate groups by articulating anti-austerity and anti-establishment sentiments with a nationalistic flavour. The slogan \u201cTake back control\u201d provided a rallying cry for these various demands. By blaming the EU for the deterioration of social and political conditions in the UK, Brexit became a hegemonic signifier \u2013 one around which a new \u201cpeople\u201d, identified as leavers, has coalesced. These are the \u201cpeople\u201d Johnson pretends to represent and whose will he accuses parliament of disregarding. How can we respond to such an offensive? We must not be tempted to counter Johnson\u2019s populism with a return to centrist politics. It is precisely such a centrist politics that is at the origin of the current democratic crisis in western Europe. Similarly, we should not demonise all Brexiters as deplorables, or dismiss them for being unable to recognise the intellectual and moral superiority of the European project. The campaign to leave succeeded in part because there was a democratic kernel at the core of these demands \u2013 which reflected a widespread discontent with post-democracy. In Britain, as in the rest of Europe, the way to answer the rightwing populist offensive is the construction of another \u201cpeople\u201d \u2013 through the articulation of a project that can link together various demands against the status quo. A project in which both leavers and remainers could feel that they have a voice and that their concerns are taken into account. One signifier for such a project could be a Green New Deal \u2013 which articulates multiple environmental and economic struggles around a demand for equality and social justice. To be sure, such an \u201cus\u201d will never include everybody. It does, of course, require a \u201cthem\u201d and the drawing of a political frontier. But we can have a frontier that makes democracy more radical \u2013 one that pits the people against the oligarchy, and the many against the few. \u2022 Chantal Mouffe is professor of political theory at the University of Westminster",

Before the 2019 election Morrison promised to prevent religious schools expelling students for being gay but deferred the issue after an impasse with Labor over how to legislate the change. Human rights and LGBT equality groups have lined up to criticise the bill, particularly provisions which allow medical practitioners to refuse treatment on religious grounds and exempt statements of belief from state and federal anti-discrimination laws.",

      "bodyText": "Every soldier in the Yemeni city of Aden is on edge. The main checkpoint on the coastal road has two large holes in the roof from mortar shells and the beach has been dug up into berms to slow the advance of any hostile vehicles. The problem is that the 25 men milling around their posts are not sure what their enemy looks like. In the recent fighting which saw the separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC) eject from the city troops loyal to the exiled Yemeni president \u2013 their former allies \u2013 al-Qaida took advantage of the chaos, putting on STC uniforms to ambush the soldiers here. \u201cThey raided every checkpoint up to this one,\u201d said Munier al-Atifeh, 42, an STC soldier. \u201cTerrorists, Islah [the Islamist bloc of the Yemeni government], what does it matter? They all want the same thing, which is to keep the south weak.\u201d More than four years in, Yemen\u2019s conflict is now actually three wars in one: a fight between the Iran-backed northern Houthi rebels and the Saudi-led coalition of Arab nations; a fight between both those parties and extremist elements such as al-Qaida and Islamic State; and belatedly, a fight between the STC, which wants a return to independence for south Yemen, and its former Yemeni government allies. The Guardian was invited by the STC to see the situation on the ground in Aden. What we found was a complicated tangle of separatist militias and politicians trying to consolidate control in a situation where alliances that may still exist on paper do not mean anything in reality. A situation that will make it even harder to bring an end to a war which has already killed an estimated 100,000 people and sparked the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis. After simmering hostility for years, the southerners and the government of the president, Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi came to blows thanks to the Houthis: a devastating drone and missile attack on a military parade in Aden last month killed more than 30 STC soldiers, including an important senior commander, Munir Mahmoud, known as Abu al-Yamama. Southerners accused the Hadi government of disregarding the threat posed to southern forces by the Houthis by failing to share intelligence. Demonstrations and four days of intense fighting followed, killing dozens and driving men loyal to Hadi out of Aden\u2019s presidential palace, military bases and airport. The fighting also called the stability of the Saudi-led coalition into question after the reaction of the United Arab Emirates, its second-biggest member. When Hadi\u2019s Saudi-backed troops tried to launch a counterattack on 29 August, the UAE, which funds and arms the STC, launched airstrikes against them, killing about 40 soldiers and civilians. Aden has been the interim internationally-recognised capital of Yemen since the Houthis forced Hadi to leave Sana\u2019a in 2015, but in this new chapter of the war, the Yemeni government no longer has a presence there. The UAE strikes were condemned by Yemen\u2019s information minister, Moammar al-Eryani, as a \u201ctreacherous\u201d attack. The port city of Aden is nestled in the natural harbour formed by the crater of a dormant volcano. Jagged mountains surround it, curled around the city like a sleeping dragon. The ocean blue of the STC flag, usually twinned with that of the UAE, is unmissable. Many southerners say they were not happy with the creation of modern Yemen in 1994 and that the national government has consistently marginalised them. Hadi, who became president in 2012 after Yemen\u2019s longtime autocrat Ali Abdullah Saleh was deposed in the Arab spring, is seen as weak for his failure to stop al-Qaida from terrorising the south before help arrived from the UAE. Adenis are proud of their distinct and cosmopolitan history: African, Chinese, Indian and Persian traders have all left their mark on the port city, as well as the Portuguese, Ottomans and the British, for whom there is a particular nostalgic fondness. The golden days, however, are long gone. STC officials point out trappings of the British Empire, such as the only churches on the Arabian peninsula and a gate on the corniche built for the Queen\u2019s visit in 1954, but they are all pockmarked with bullet holes and other damage from the war. Aden\u2019s luxurious beachfront hotels became the frontline in the battle to drive the Houthis out of the city in 2015. They tower above the sea, roofs caved in and their insides burnt out. \u201cWe have a difficult job to rebuild and make sure Aden is safe but we are ready to do so,\u201d said Fadhel al-Gade, assistant secretary-general of the STC\u2019s presidential council. \u201cWe are doing this for ourselves since others won\u2019t.\u201d The STC may want independence but it is heavily reliant on its UAE patrons: one well-connected source in the city said the Emiratis came to the rescue with the airstrike against Hadi\u2019s troops because the STC does not have the numbers to fight them off alone. The UAE\u2019s aim in Yemen as well as elsewhere in the region is to curb the power of political Islamist groups such as Yemen\u2019s Islah, which it sees as a threat, and to gain control of the crucial Bab el-Mandeb strait which connects the Red Sea to the gulf of Aden \u2013 one of the world\u2019s most important oil shipping channels. A protectorate of sorts in south Yemen fits both bills. While the UAE announced it would withdraw the majority of its troops from the country in July, it still retains most of its sway on the ground through the STC and allied militias. Maj Gen Ahmed Saeed bin Buraik said the UAE\u2019s support in both the fight against the Houthis and Sunni extremists was welcome.

On a brief visit en route to Aden, Aradah told the Guardian he believed a peaceful solution could be found to the new schism. What happens next depends on whether the STC will try to shore up its position outside the city of Aden: most observers fear more clashes in Abyan province, the midpoint between Aden and government-loyal Shabwa. The only certainty in the war-within-a-war is that more fighting will bring more civilian suffering. In the al-Jafinah displacement camp on the outskirts of Marib, Mohammed and Khadija Rubaiyah are doing their best to make a home in the heat and the sand. They are from the lush green highlands of Hajjah in Yemen\u2019s north, but were forced to leave in March after their area saw intense fighting between Houthi and government forces.

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s a strange old world for Australians to have woken up in. But it would appear that Donald Trump either suspects Alexander Downer is part of a leftist-inspired deep state conspiracy to bring down his presidency or, more likely, believes that it is useful to him politically to create that impression as he embarks on the 2020 campaign trail.</p> <p>Just to be clear, we have arrived in this unexpected place because Downer did the correct thing. After George Papadopoulos, then a foreign policy adviser to Trump, told him Moscow had damaging information about Hillary Clinton \u201cduring a night of heavy drinking\u201d at the Kensington Wine Rooms in London in May 2016, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/30/donald-trump-russia-inquiry-george-papadopoulos-australian-diplomat\">Downer, then Australian high commissioner to the UK, told the authorities</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/01/donald-trump-urged-scott-morrison-help-discredit-mueller-inquiry\">Australian government agreed to help Donald Trump investigate Mueller inquiry origins</a> </p> </aside>  <p>From the moment that happened, Australia was stapled to cartwheeling madness in Washington, which has only intensified as Trump <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-floodgates-open-on-trump?utm_brand=tny&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_social-type=owned&amp;mbid=social_twitter&amp;utm_medium=social\">thrashes ever more wildly</a> against his potential impeachment.</p> <p>In late May, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/25/donald-trump-wants-investigation-into-australias-role-in-russian-hoax\">Trump made it clear</a> he wanted Australia\u2019s role in setting off the FBI inquiry into links between Russia and his election campaign examined by the US attorney general, William Barr.</p> <p>Shortly after, Australia\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, said publicly the government would consider any request to participate.</p> <p>A day later, on 25 May, the Australian ambassador in Washington, Joe Hockey, sent a more forward letter to Barr, copied to Trump\u2019s chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, confirming Australia would use \u201cits best endeavours to support your efforts in this matter\u201d.</p> <p>Hockey noted while Downer was no longer employed by the government, \u201cwe stand ready to provide you with all relevant information to support your inquiries\u201d.</p> <p>Then we arrive at Trump asking Morrison directly.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/01/donald-trump-urged-scott-morrison-help-discredit-mueller-inquiry\">The New York Times reported this call</a>, leader to leader, happened just before Morrison departed for his American visit last week. Presumably at this point Trump had the story about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/26/slug-trump-ukraine-latest-whistleblower-complaint-2020-election\">what he did or did not say to Volodymyr Zelenskiy</a>, the president of Ukraine \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/29/morrison-leaning-into-trump-might-have-a-strange-logic-but-its-risky\">the story which has triggered last week\u2019s impeachment calls</a> \u2013 breathing down his neck.</p> <p>Morrison\u2019s press office said in response to the New York Times story, which broke on Tuesday morning, Australian time, the prime minister told Trump that Australia was ready to help, which could mean something, or nothing.</p> <p>It would be hard, given the sum of the parts, for Australia to do anything other than offer a broad statement of cooperation. Saying nick off Donald might look like we had something to hide, and it would certainly trigger more unhinging from the leader of the free world, and there\u2019s already a surfeit of that.</p> <p>But <em>how</em> is Australia helping, exactly?</p> <p>Are we investigating Downer ourselves?</p> <p>Are we handing over relevant intelligence to this inquiry?</p> <p>What undertakings, specifically and precisely, has the prime minister given?

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s a strange old world for Australians to have woken up in. But it would appear that Donald Trump either suspects Alexander Downer is part of a leftist-inspired deep state conspiracy to bring down his presidency or, more likely, believes that it is useful to him politically to create that impression as he embarks on the 2020 campaign trail. Just to be clear, we have arrived in this unexpected place because Downer did the correct thing. After George Papadopoulos, then a foreign policy adviser to Trump, told him Moscow had damaging information about Hillary Clinton \u201cduring a night of heavy drinking\u201d at the Kensington Wine Rooms in London in May 2016, Downer, then Australian high commissioner to the UK, told the authorities. From the moment that happened, Australia was stapled to cartwheeling madness in Washington, which has only intensified as Trump thrashes ever more wildly against his potential impeachment. In late May, Trump made it clear he wanted Australia\u2019s role in setting off the FBI inquiry into links between Russia and his election campaign examined by the US attorney general, William Barr. Shortly after, Australia\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, said publicly the government would consider any request to participate. A day later, on 25 May, the Australian ambassador in Washington, Joe Hockey, sent a more forward letter to Barr, copied to Trump\u2019s chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, confirming Australia would use \u201cits best endeavours to support your efforts in this matter\u201d. Hockey noted while Downer was no longer employed by the government, \u201cwe stand ready to provide you with all relevant information to support your inquiries\u201d. Then we arrive at Trump asking Morrison directly. The New York Times reported this call, leader to leader, happened just before Morrison departed for his American visit last week. Presumably at this point Trump had the story about what he did or did not say to Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the president of Ukraine \u2013 the story which has triggered last week\u2019s impeachment calls \u2013 breathing down his neck. Morrison\u2019s press office said in response to the New York Times story, which broke on Tuesday morning, Australian time, the prime minister told Trump that Australia was ready to help, which could mean something, or nothing. It would be hard, given the sum of the parts, for Australia to do anything other than offer a broad statement of cooperation. Saying nick off Donald might look like we had something to hide, and it would certainly trigger more unhinging from the leader of the free world, and there\u2019s already a surfeit of that. But how is Australia helping, exactly? Are we investigating Downer ourselves? Are we handing over relevant intelligence to this inquiry? What undertakings, specifically and precisely, has the prime minister given? Until Morrison stands up and takes questions himself, this remains a mystery. While I suspect, in lieu of evidence to the contrary, that Morrison is trying to dead bat Trump, to humour him if you like, rather than race to send Downer \u2013 the foreign affairs minister who took Australia into the Iraq war \u2013 off for a bout of extraordinary rendition, we need to be very clear that Australia is being sucked into a wretchedly partisan process, which draws us into the insanity of Trump trying to dig himself out of an impeachment hole as he campaigns for 2020. If the world hadn\u2019t gone nuts, what Morrison should have said to Trump in that call is Downer \u2013 an experienced Australian diplomat and former foreign affairs minister and long-time supporter of the alliance \u2013 did the correct and patriotic thing, presented as he was with evidence of foreign interference in an American presidential election. Again in a world that wasn\u2019t arse-about, we could have said that if the circumstances were reversed, if a foreign actor was looking to interfere in Australian democratic processes, and an American diplomat had knowledge of this, we would expect the appropriate authorities to be informed. End of story. Good talk Donald. See you next week. But given Trump prevailed in the 2016 contest with or without Russia\u2019s help, and is now trying to get a grip on this crisis so he can turn it to his political advantage, Australia is ringside, alert and alarmed, as this is spun into a persecution narrative, where poor innocent Donald is under siege from the deep state, or a crafty Aussie double agent. Meanwhile, the Australian government is tiptoeing gingerly around the madman in the White House, hoping he doesn\u2019t detonate. There\u2019s one more thing to be clear about. Morrison did have an opportunity in Washington to be transparent about Trump\u2019s appeals to him on this very question. While the Australian press were all standing in Joe Hockey\u2019s backyard in Washington, Morrison was asked by Jacob Greber, the Washington correspondent for the Australian Financial Review, whether there was \u201cany discussion around documents being declassified relating to Alexander Downer and a certain meeting in London? Did that come up at all?\u201d It was a high lob. But the prime minister declined Greber\u2019s kind invitation to bring the voters into his confidence. \u201cWell I\u2019m not going to go into private conversations but what we were discussing yesterday were issues about our strategic relationship from trade. The frontier technologies, our defence relationships, these were not issues that were there for discussion.\u201d Frankly, it would have been far better if Morrison had been upfront about all this when he had the opportunity, rather than have the New York Times deliver Australians the news.

However, the review by the independent parliamentary expenses authority found the former senator had misused other taxi and family travel allowances and ordered him to pay back $1,534. The review \u2013 obtained by blogger and freedom of information expert William Summers \u2013 looked at Anning\u2019s use of taxpayer-funded allowances to attend a series of far right rallies in Sydney and Melbourne. The documents show authorities queried Anning about the legitimacy of his claims and how they related to parliamentary business. But the authority was ultimately convinced Anning\u2019s claims for the rallies were within the rules and consistent with \u201cvalue for money\u201d principles. Anning argued the trips were related to parliamentary business because his former constituents in Queensland were concerned about \u201cethnic-based violence\u201d. \u201cSenator Anning showed [the authority] various documents from Queensland-based constituents and others who raised concerns regarding ethnic based violence occurring in Queensland, immigration, employment and the moving of refugees to remote towns in Queensland,\u201d the review, dated May, said. \u201cThese issues and others were put forward by Senator Anning as being significant policy concerns for both him and his constituents. \u201cIt should be noted that it is not [the authority\u2019s] role to determine the merit of \u2018parliamentary business\u2019 for senators and members.\u201d Anning was ordered to repay $1,500 for wrongly claimed taxi trips and a 2017 flight between Canberra and Gladstone by his wife. Anning frequently billed taxpayers for business-class flights to controversial events. Earlier this year he billed taxpayers $2,600 to attend a far right rally in St Kilda, where some attendees were seen delivering Nazi salutes. The rally was organised by Blair Cottrell, who has been convicted of inciting contempt for Muslims. Anning also charged taxpayers for flights, accommodation and car costs during a trip to join the Canadian far-right figure Lauren Southern at a Sydney rally, where they protested the treatment of white South African farmers. Guardian Australia also revealed earlier this year that taxpayers had paid almost $3,000 for Anning to travel to Melbourne the day after the Christchurch shooting, where he was struck with an egg while defending incendiary comments about the massacre. It was also revealed that Anning had claimed a taxpayer-funded accommodation and meals allowance to stay at his brother\u2019s hotel in the regional town of Babinda.",

But low interest rates and shifting economic priorities, combined with bureaucratic delays in how the scheme was originally administered, has resulted in less than anticipated pick-up. The government has continually pointed to the \u201cinvestment pipeline\u201d as proof of its slowburn success. \u201cRight now, including conditional approvals, the Naif has invested upwards of $1.4bn in 14 jobs-generating projects across northern Australia. In total, the projects approved for Naif loans are forecast to support more than 4,000 jobs and more than $2.9bn in broad-based public benefit,\u201d the minister for resources and northern Australia, Matt Canavan, said in a statement. \u201cWhichever way you look at it, that\u2019s a significant investment in new and innovative projects in our north. \u201cThe Naif continues to successfully support the development of new industries, businesses and jobs by leveraging private sector investment via its concessional loans to projects. \u201cOnce Naif makes an investment decision and conditions are met, how and when proponents choose to draw down on loan approvals is a matter for them.\u201d One of those recent approvals, a $25m loan for an on-farm beef processing site in central Queensland will be the first funds to flow through to the state originally touted as the biggest beneficiary of the fund. But the approval for the abattoir of cattle barons Blair and Josie Angus raised eyebrows on social media, given the couple\u2019s staunch public defence and support for the Coalition government. Canavan denied he had any influence over the Angus project, or any other submission. \u201cNominated projects are rigorously assessed to ensure taxpayer funds are invested wisely,\u201d he said. \u201cAs minister for northern Australia, a big part of my job is to connect with the dynamic businesses and industries of the north \u2013 both emerging and established. \u201cI live in northern Australia, spend much of my time in northern communities and am proud of the people who are driving the north\u2019s development. These businesspeople have displayed guts and grit in applying for Naif loans and should not be criticised for their success in meeting the tough criteria required to secure a loan. \u201cUnder the Naif legislation, I have no power to direct the Naif to invest in any project. Any implication this has occurred is factually incorrect and an insult to the integrity of the independent Naif board.\u201d The Queensland Labor government has also awarded a grant to the project, as part of its own regional jobs fund. Labor senator Murray Watt, who has been tasked with building Labor\u2019s federal profile in regional Queensland, did not criticise the Angus project, instead concentrating on \u201ccentral Queensland finally getting something out of the federal government\u2019s disappointing Naif\u201d. \u201cThe question now is how long central Queensland will have to wait to actually see these promised Naif dollars,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cAt this rate it will take 500 years for the government to spend the whole $5bn. \u201cNot one project in Queensland has actually received a dollar from the Naif, despite various \u2018investment decisions\u2019. \u201cThe federal government needs to start releasing funding from the Naif now to start delivering the jobs central Queensland needs. Until then it\u2019s just more empty promises.\u201d The LNP\u2019s Michelle Landry, who is the MP for Capricornia, received an almost 12% swing towards her at the last election. The swing away from Labor in north and central Queensland electorates helped hand the LNP three Queensland Senate positions, in what was one of Labor\u2019s worst election results in decades.",

      "bodyText": "Kari Paul, logging out for the evening. Here is what you should know from this afternoon: Donald Trump reportedly pushed the Australian PM to investigate Mueller inquiry in an attempt to discredit it. In addition to Trump\u2019s call to Australia, his administration has held private meetings with foreign intelligence officials in the UK and Italy in an attempt to discredit ongoing investigations into Russian interference with the 2016 elections, the Washington Post reports. The US issued economic sanctions against Russians for meddling in past elections in an attempt to prevent interference in upcoming presidential elections. The whistleblower responsible for revealing Donald Trump\u2019s call to Ukraine was within their rights to do so, the Office of the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community said in a statement released Monday. Donald Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani signaled in a tweet on Monday he may not comply with an impeachment subpoena issued by the House, saying it \u201craises significant issues concerning legitimacy.\u201d The Australian government agreed to help Donald Trump investigate the origins of the Mueller inquiry into 2016 election manipulation. Trump called the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and asked him to help discredit investigations exposing Russian interference. According to two officials with knowledge of the call, Trump asked Morrison to help the US attorney general, William Barr, find evidence for a review into the Mueller inquiry. On Tuesday morning the Australian government confirmed the call had taken place and said Morrison had agreed to assist. \u201cThe Australian government has always been ready to assist and cooperate with efforts that help shed further light on the matters under investigation,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cThe PM confirmed this readiness once again in conversation with the president. Read the full report from the Guardian here. Donald Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani signaled in a tweet on Monday he may not comply with an impeachment subpoena issued by the House, saying it \u201craises significant issues concerning legitimacy.\u201d In a letter presented to Giuliani on Monday, the heads of the intelligence, oversight, and foreign affairs committees in the House of Representatives asked for more information related to Trump\u2019s recent appeals to the president of Ukraine to investigate political opponent Joe Biden. They asked Giuliani to produce all text messages, phone records and other communications related to the conversations with the president \u201cin order to determine the full extent of this effort by the President and his Administration to press Ukraine to interfere in our 2020 presidential election\u201d. Giuliani said in a tweet the subpoena will be given \u201cappropriate consideration\u201d but cast doubt on it. The House Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming targeted the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, in a tweet on Monday, saying the Ukraine scandal involving Donald Trump \u201cis starting to seem like a political set up\u201d. Pelosi said in an interview with 60 minutes that Trump had told her the call with Ukraine, on which he is accused of colluding to discredit political opponent Joe Biden, was \u201cperfect\u201d. \u201cHe told me it was perfect,\u201d she said. \u201c\u2019There was nothing in the call.\u2019 But I know what was in the call. I mean, it was in the public domain. He didn\u2019t even know that it was wrong.\u201d Pelosi began an impeachment inquiry officially last week. The whistleblower responsible for revealing Donald Trump\u2019s call to Ukraine was within their rights to do so, the Office of the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community said in a statement released Monday. The statement comes after Trump baselessly claimed the whistleblower who publicized his Ukraine call was able to do so due to a recent rule change enabling it. The ICIG said the disclosure was submitted in the same form it has had in place since 24 May 2018. Any individual who wants to report an urgent concern \u201cneed not possess first-hand information in order to file a complaint\u201d, according to the rule. The attorney general, William Barr, has held private meetings with foreign intelligence officials in an attempt to discredit ongoing investigations into Russian interference with the 2016 elections, the Washington Post reports. The investigation reveals the administration\u2019s troubling dedication to investigating adversaries, the Post reports: Current and former intelligence and law enforcement officials expressed frustration and alarm Monday that the head of the justice department was taking such a direct role in re-examining what they view as conspiracy theories and baseless allegations of misconduct. Barr reportedly made personal appeals to British intelligence officials, Italian officials and Australian officials to help discredit the Mueller investigation, the report says. Capitol Hill reporters are \u201cmourning\u201d the end of representative Chris Collins\u2019 congressional career. His pending guilty plea for insider trading means that two of Trump\u2019s earliest congressional endorsers have now been indicted. And many people looked back at this moment from January 2017, when Collins bragged about trading in on insider secrets while standing in the Capitol. The US issued new economic sanctions against a number of Russian nationals on Monday in response to meddling in past elections. Seven Russians targeted by the sanctions were involved in an internet \u201ctroll factory\u201d that manufactured news and online activity meant to manipulate American voters. The sanctions come as social media sites and the US government seek to prevent election interference ahead of the 2020 presidential elections. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the move is meant to make clear the US \u201cwill not tolerate foreign interference\u201d in elections. \u201cThe United States will continue to push back against malign actors who seek to subvert our democratic processes,\u201d Pompeo said, \u201cand we will not hesitate to impose further costs on Russia for its destabilizing and unacceptable activities.\u201d Hello readers, Kari Paul here in San Francisco, taking over the blog for the next few hours. Stand by for more news. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Kari Paul, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer who reportedly played a key role in trying to convince Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, has been subpoenaed by three House committees. Trump similarly asked the Australian prime minister to assist in a Justice Department investigation of the origins of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, according to the New York Times. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo was present for Trump\u2019s phone call with the Ukrainian president, the Wall Street Journal reported. The news could throw even more of a spotlight on the state department in the impeachment inquiry. Trump was denounced for threatening the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, Adam Schiff, with imprisonment for treason. Mitch McConnell confirmed the Senate would follow through on its constitutional duty and hold a trial on whether to remove Trump from office if the House impeached him. Kari will have more on the news of the day, so stay tuned. NBC News has now confirmed the New York Times\u2019 reporting that Trump asked the Australian prime minister for assistance in a Justice Department investigation of the origins of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe. While speaking at the UN General Assembly last week, secretary of state Mike Pompeo dismissed any concerns that state department officials had acted improperly in its dealings with Ukraine. Pompeo also belittled the whistleblower for relying on \u201csecondhand knowledge\u201d in the complaint about Trump\u2019s phone call with the Ukrainian president. This now seems particularly ironic because, if the Wall Street Journal\u2019s reporting that Pompeo participated in the call is correct, he could have quite easily cleared up any confusion by providing firsthand knowledge of the conversation. The late-afternoon headlines are really piling up. The New York Times is now reporting that Trump similarly encouraged the Australian prime minister to work with attorney general William Barr in an investigation meant to discredit the findings of special counsel Robert Mueller. The Times reports: The White House restricted access to the call\u2019s transcript to a small group of the president\u2019s aides, one of the officials said, an unusual decision that is similar to the handling of a July call with the Ukrainian president that is at the heart of House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump. Like that call, the discussion with Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia shows the extent to which Mr. Trump sees the attorney general as a critical partner in his goal to show that the Mueller investigation had corrupt and partisan origins, and the extent that Mr. Trump sees the Justice Department inquiry as a potential way to gain leverage over America\u2019s closest allies. And like the call with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the discussion with Mr. Morrison shows the president using high-level diplomacy to advance his personal political interests. President Trump initiated the discussion in recent weeks with Mr. Morrison explicitly for the purpose of requesting Australia\u2019s help in the Justice Department review of the Russia investigation, according to the two people with knowledge of the discussion. Mr. Barr requested that Mr. Trump speak to Mr. Morrison, one of the people said. Another poll has found that Americans are evenly split on impeaching Trump, even as support has risen in recent days. According to the CNN/SSRS poll, 47% of Americans are in favor of impeaching the president and removing him from office, compared to 45% who oppose it. That nearly matches the Quinnipiac poll released earlier today, which found 47% of Americans backing impeachment and 47% opposing it. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo took part in Trump\u2019s controversial call with the Ukrainian president, the Wall Street Journal is reporting. Pompeo has already been sent a subpoena from three House committees, and some senior state department officials are scheduled to speak to the panels. If Pompeo has firsthand information about the call, it could drag the state department even more directly into the impeachment inquiry. Adam Schiff of the intelligence committee, Eliot Engel of the foreign affairs committee and Elijah Cummings of the oversight committee wrote a letter to Giuliani asking him to hand over materials relevant to the impeachment inquiry by Oct. 15. The three Democratic committee chairmen wrote: \u201cOur inquiry includes an investigation of credible allegations that you acted as an agent of the President in a scheme to advance his personal political interests by abusing the power of the Office of the President.\u201d The subpoena goes on to specifically request any communications Giuliani may have showing evidence that other Trump administration officials were involved in the \u201cscheme.\u201d Last week, Giuliani tweeted this screenshot of an apparent text from Kurt Volker, the president\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine who resigned on Friday. The Democratic chairmen of three House committees announced they have subpoenaed Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer. The former New York mayor has reportedly played a key role in trying to convince Ukraine to launch an investigation of Joe Biden and his son, a claim that Giuliani himself has confirmed in television appearances. When pressed last week by CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo whether he urged Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, Giuliani eventually said, \u201cOf course I did.\u201d Despite the possibility that Trump encouraged a foreign country to meddle in the 2020 election for his own personal benefit, the president\u2019s approval rating among Republicans remains sky high, according to the latest Quinnipiac poll. A political commentator argued last week that the most telling aspect of Trump\u2019s approval rating may be how little it has changed since he took office. More data from the latest Quinnipiac poll: a HuffPost reporter noted that support for impeachment has particularly picked up speed among African Americans. A new poll found that Americans are evenly split on whether Trump should be impeached and removed from office. According to the Quinnipiac University poll, 47% of Americans say Trump should be impeached and removed from office, while 47% say he should not. Those numbers represent a 20-point swing from less than a week ago. A narrow majority of Americans approve of House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry, with 52% of respondents supporting it while 45% oppose it. The numbers confirm that impeachment remains a hotly contested issue among Americans, but the ground is clearly shifting rapidly on the subject. One of the whistleblower\u2019s lawyers has sent a tweet defending the person\u2019s anonymity despite Trump\u2019s claim that the White House is trying to find about more about the official. The lawyer, Andrew Bakaj, warned that retaliating against the whistleblower would be a violation of federal law. This post has been updated to add more context about Trump\u2019s comments. The whistleblower\u2019s lawyers have raised concerns about their client\u2019s safety in a letter to the office of the direction of national intelligence. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, similarly expressed fear for the whistleblower\u2019s safety earlier today. Trump\u2019s comment that the White House was trying to find out more about the whistleblower raised concerns that the president would defy the federal protections the anonymous person is entitled to. During the House intelligence committee\u2019s hearing last week with the acting director of national intelligence, Democrats voiced fear that Trump\u2019s handling of the complaint could scare off future whistleblowers. This post has been updated to add more context about Trump\u2019s comments. When asked by a reporter whether he knew the identity of the whistleblower, Trump said that the White House is \u201ctrying to find out\u201d about the whistleblower. The whistleblower has remained anonymous, but the New York Times controversially reported last week that he is a CIA official with an expertise on Ukraine. This post has been updated to add more context about Trump\u2019s comments. In non-impeachment news, representative Chris Collins, a Republican of New York, has reportedly sent a letter of resignation to Nancy Pelosi a day before he was expected to plead guilty to insider trading charges. The Washington Post reports: Collins, 69, allegedly tipped off his son to confidential information about an Australian biotechnology company, Innate Immunotherapeutics, that he learned as a member of its board. Collins and several others used the information to avoid more than $700,000 in losses, according to prosecutors. He is scheduled to change his plea Tuesday afternoon in a Manhattan federal court. ... Collins won reelection last year after initially suspending his campaign, then reversing that decision despite pressure from Republicans to step aside and allow another GOP candidate on the ballot. Collins was sworn in for a fourth term in January but was not seated on any House committees pending resolution of his indictment. Several candidates have announced campaigns to challenge Collins in 2020, including GOP state Sens. Chris Jacobs and Rob Ortt as well as Democratic lawyer Nate McMurray, who came about 1,000 votes shy of unseating Collins last year. In addition to calling Trump a \u201ccorrupt human tornado,\u201d Hillary Clinton also reacted to reports that the State Department is still investigating the email practices of her employees while she was secretary of state. The Washington Post reported Saturday: As many as 130 officials have been contacted in recent weeks by State Department investigators \u2014 a list that includes senior officials who reported directly to Clinton as well as others in lower-level jobs whose emails were at some point relayed to her inbox, said current and former State Department officials. Those targeted were notified that emails they sent years ago have been retroactively classified and now constitute potential security violations, according to letters reviewed by The Washington Post. In virtually all of the cases, potentially sensitive information, now recategorized as \u2018classified,\u2019 was sent to Clinton\u2019s unsecure inbox. State Department investigators began contacting the former officials about 18 months ago, after President Trump\u2019s election, and then seemed to drop the effort before picking it up in August, officials said. Clinton\u2019s reaction to this news was ... dismissive. Hillary Clinton has once again weighed in on the impeachment inquiry against Trump, this time in as concise a way as possible. The former Democratic presidential candidate has voiced support for House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry, applauding Nancy Pelosi for formally launching it last week. Clinton said Thursday at an event for the abortion rights group NARAL: \u201cThis is a moment of reckoning, a historic moment, and I\u2019m very grateful to Speaker Pelosi for her leadership.\u201d Democratic lawmakers and commentators have sharply criticized Trump for suggesting that the House intelligence committee chairman, Adam Schiff, should be arrested for treason. A Democratic presidential candidate argued it presented more evidence for Trump\u2019s impeachment: A former senior adviser to Barack Obama compared Trump\u2019s actions to those of Vladimir Putin: A former Clinton White House aide pointed out that the true treason may lie elsewhere in this controversy: But one senior lawmaker, the Republican Senate majority leader, seems entirely unconcerned about Trump pondering the imprisonment of a political opponent: Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Trump has suggested that the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee should be arrested for treason over his opening statement at a congressional hearing last week, an idea that flies in the face of the Constitution. Mitch McConnell confirmed that the Senate would be obligated to hold a trial on whether to remove Trump from office if the House impeaches him. Another House Republican, Mac Thornberry of Texas, announced he would not seek re-election \u2013 again signaling the GOP\u2019s low expectations of retaking control of the chamber next year. The blog is still covering the latest on impeachment, so stay tuned. Jay Sekulow, one of Trump\u2019s personal lawyers, dismissed House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry as a \u201cskirmish\u201d in comparison to the \u201cwar\u201d that was special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation. Sekulow helped guide Trump through Mueller\u2019s investigation, which ended earlier this year after nearly two years and has largely receded into the background as concerns over the president\u2019s Ukraine call came into focus. Jeff Flake, a former Republican senator, has written a Washington Post op-ed imploring fellow members of his party to oppose Trump\u2019s re-election. A frequent Trump critic, Flake chose to forego another Senate election last year rather than face a bruising primary against one of the president\u2019s more ardent supporters. Now, the Arizona Republican is encouraging GOP lawmakers to come out against Trump\u2019s potential second term. But he is more cautious when it comes to impeachment. Flake writes: Two years ago I stood in the Senate chamber and said: \u2018There are times when we must risk our careers in favor of our principles.\u2019 ... Now, two years later, it is my former Republican Senate colleagues who have a decision to make. Or, as I see it, two decisions to make. The first is difficult; the second is easy. ... [A]lthough impeachment now seems inevitable, I fear it all the same. I understand others who might have similar reservations. The decision to impeach or not is a difficult one indeed. Now for the easy decision. If the House decides against filing articles of impeachment, or the Senate fails to convict, Senate Republicans will have to decide whether, given what we now know about the president\u2019s actions and behavior, to support his reelection. Obviously, the answer is no. \u201cTrumpCare\u201d does not exist \u2013 this has not stopped some firms from advertising insurance products under this banner, according to a new report from Axios. \u201cTrumpcare\u201d ads are targeted to the 7% of Americans, numbering roughly 20 million, who buy their insurance directly through brokers. Often, firms selling Trumpcare sell short-term, bare bones insurance coverage likely to leave patients under-covered, Axios found. Since the president failed to repeal Obamacare legislatively, most of the work he has done on healthcare has happened through arcane rule changes. Many of those changes have made it easier for companies to offer cheap, low-coverage plans, effectively encouraging people to roll the dice with their health and finances. America\u2019s private healthcare system means under-covered patients can be left with thousands, and in some cases hundreds of thousands, of dollars in medical debt. Trump has just finished speaking at a ceremony to welcome Mark Milley, the new chairman of the joint chiefs of staff. The president began his remarks by noting the rain falling at the Virginia celebration. Trump said he had been told rain signals good fortune and predicted that Milley would be \u201cthe luckiest general in history.\u201d The president was characteristically exuberant in his comments on the US military, calling it the \u201cgreatest fighting force, without question, in the history of the world.\u201d He also thanked the outgoing chairman, Joseph Dunford. Trump said the Marine general looked the part of a senior military official, joking that he could be straight out of \u201ccentral casting.\u201d He also oddly noted that Dunford helped him form an opinion about running for president in 2016. And the president couldn\u2019t finish a speech without mention the crowd size at his campaign rallies. Noting the thousands of people who attend his events, Trump said that the creation of the Space Force is one of the biggest applause lines. Trump is currently attending a ceremony to welcome Mark Milley, the new chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, in Fort Myer, Virginia. The Army general is succeeding Joseph F. Dunford Jr., who was appointed by Barack Obama. Mitch McConnell has confirmed that the Senate would hold a trial to determine whether to remove Trump from office if the House impeached him. The Senate majority leader said: \u201cI would have no choice but to take it up.\u201d The Kentucky Republican made similar comments on his constitutional obligation back in March. But this is the first time since the House announced its formal impeachment inquiry that McConnell has confirmed the Senate would hold a trial. Representative Mac Thornberry, a Republican of Texas, has announced he will not seek re-election next year. Thornberry, the top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, has served in Congress since 1995. He is the sixth House Republican from Texas to announce he will not seek re-election next year. His departure, along with at least 15 others in the House Republican caucus, underscores the impress that the GOP does not have high expectations of taking back the House next year. A fact-check has struck again to tear down one of Trump\u2019s claims about the Ukraine controversy. In this case, the president suggested that the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, Adam Schiff, should be arrested for treason after parodying the White House memo on the Ukraine call during a congressional hearing. But such exaggeration is not illegal, as the Constitution specifically outlines. From CNN\u2019s fact-checking reporter: John Bolton, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, ended his first public appearance since leaving the administration by issuing a warning about North Korea. But the hawkish Bolton deflected another question about whether \u201cbromance diplomacy\u201d was good foreign policy, an apparent reference to Trump\u2019s glowing comments about Kim Jong-un. Despite an avalanche of fact-checks, Trump is still repeating his favorite falsehoods about his call with the Ukrainian president. Just in case you missed the first few dozen times the blog covered this: there is no evidence that Joe Biden or his son, Hunter, engaged in corruption. The former Ukrainian prosecutor who first investigated corruption claims against a company with ties to the younger Biden has even said he saw no evidence that the Bidens violated Ukrainian law. Trump is also wrong on how much money European allies have given Ukraine. Since Russia\u2019s 2014 annexation of Crimea, the European Union has given $16.5 billion in grants and loans to Ukraine. In comparison, the United States has provided at least $1.3 billion to Ukraine since late 2013. And all of this evades the most important questions about Trump\u2019s Ukraine call. Namely, did the president try to solicit assistance from a foreign country in the 2020 election? And did his aides try to conceal details of the call to cover that up? John Bolton \u2013 who was ousted (or left voluntarily, depending on who you ask) as Trump\u2019s national security adviser earlier this month \u2013 criticized the president\u2019s foreign policy in his first public appearance since departing the administration. Bolton has always taken a hard line on foreign adversaries like North Korea and Iran, a position that increasingly diverged with Trump\u2019s as the president sought to dial back the United States\u2019 international presence. But Bolton\u2019s appearance is also a notable marker for how much has happened this month. The former official left the administration days after reports emerged that he pushed back against Trump\u2019s secret plan to host the Taliban at Camp David for peace talks within days of the Sept. 11 anniversary. That controversy was about three weeks ago. And it\u2019s been completely expelled from newspapers\u2019 front pages and cable news\u2019 chyrons over reports that the president tried to solicit assistance from a foreign country in the 2020 election. Welcome to the Trump era of news. The Daily Beast has more on Trump and his allies\u2019 false claim about a rule change that allowed the whistleblower to report on his conversations with White House officials: From Donald Trump on down, prominent Republicans used part of their weekend to falsely accuse Trump\u2019s hand-picked intelligence community inspector general (IC IG) of secretly changing the requirements for intelligence workers to submit whistleblower tips as part of a deep state plot to clear the way for the Aug. 12 complaint about Trump\u2019s phone call to the president of Ukraine. The smoking gun in the putative conspiracy is an obscure government form, IC IG ICWSP Form 401, also known as the Disclosure of Urgent Concern Form. The document is put out by the IC IG for intelligence workers who need to file urgent complaints that trigger special treatment under the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act. According to the GOP and an army of conservative commentators, the old version of the form prohibited workers from submitting urgent complaints based on secondhand information; only misconduct witnessed personally could be reported. That changed in early August, the false claim goes, when ICIG Michael Atkinson snuck through a hasty revision to the complaint form that reversed long-standing policy. Trump, echoing some of his Republican allies, blamed the whistleblower complaint about his Ukraine call on a rule change allowing certain evidence to be included in such reports. One of the president\u2019s closest congressional allies, senator Lindsey Graham, voiced a similar concern on CBS News\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d yesterday. But Trump\u2019s own White House corroborated several key details of the whistleblower complaint in its own memo on the Ukraine call. And George Conway, who is married to senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway, pointed out in a lengthy Twitter thread Saturday that the evidence the whistleblower provides based on his conversations with White House officials could still be admissible. Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker announced in an email to supporters that his campaign has raised the $1.7 million it said it needed to stay in the 2020 race. Booker said in a statement: \u201cThis moment is a testimony to the power of what\u2019s possible when people unite in common purpose and work toward a shared goal. \u201cThanks to this outpouring of support, we see a viable path forward to continue growing a winning campaign. I\u2019m staying in this race \u2013 and I\u2019m in it to win.\u201d Booker\u2019s campaign sent a fundraising plea to supporters earlier this month, warning that the New Jersey senator would be forced to drop out if they did not see a surge of donations. They set a goal of raising $1.7 million by the third-quarter fundraising deadline, which is at midnight tonight. The campaign now said it hopes to raise a total of $2 million before tonight\u2019s deadline. Good morning, live blog readers! Here\u2019s something you don\u2019t get to say every day in a democratic country: the president is floating the idea of arresting a senior lawmaker of the opposing party who is investigating him. During the 2016 election, Donald Trump\u2019s supporters relished chanting that Hillary Clinton should be \u201clocked up.\u201d But the president is now turning his attention to Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee who is investigating whether Trump solicited assistance from Ukraine in the 2020 election. The debate around Schiff\u2019s opening statement during last week\u2019s hearing with the acting director of national intelligence centers on whether it was the best judgment call to parody the White House memo on the Ukraine call in order to make a point. That seems like a pretty far cry from treason \u2013 which the Constitution says \u201cshall consist only in levying war against [the United States], or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort.\u201d Using that definition, Trump\u2019s alleged attempts to convince a foreign country to meddle in a US election seem like a much more appropriate contender for the \u201ctreason\u201d title. Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping its eye on: Trump will attend a ceremony for the new joint chiefs of staff chairman and have lunch with the vice president. He will later participate in the ceremonial swearing-in of the new secretary of labor, Eugene Scalia, and meet with the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is rolling out his CEO tax proposal while campaigning in New Hampshire. Tonight is the deadline for candidates\u2019 third-quarter fundraising, and mediocre results could put more pressure on some lower-polling contenders to drop out. The blog is keeping an eye on all of that, so stay tuned.",

      "bodyText": "As Australia grapples with extended drought across the country \u2013 in many places, the worst on record \u2013 the Coalition has been talking up its $7bn drought package in support of \u201cstruggling farming families\u201d. Labor\u2019s Joel Fitzgibbon has called it the \u201cmost audacious lie\u201d he has ever heard in politics, saying very little of the $7bn is actually hitting the ground in drought-affected communities. After initially refusing to provide a breakdown of the figure, the government has now provided Guardian Australia with details. Where does the $7bn figure come from? Most of the $7bn has not been spent. The bulk of the $7bn figure is attributable to the government\u2019s $5bn Future Drought Fund, which passed the parliament in July. The government established the fund with an initial $3.9bn credit, which was reallocated from an infrastructure fund set up by Labor called the Building Australia Fund. Earnings from the fund, which will be managed like the Medical Research Future Fund, will be reinvested into the drought fund until the balance reaches $5bn, which is expected to be achieved in 2028-29. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said the fund would ensure \u201cmoney aside for non-rainy days in the future\u201d. What is the $5bn Future Drought Fund being spent on? Nothing as yet. The fund starts making disbursements from 1 July next year, with $100m being made each year to support Australian farmers and communities to become more prepared for, and resilient to, the effects of drought. The minister for the drought, David Littleproud, said the fund was for the future, in the good years and the bad years. \u201cThis is about foresight of drought policy in this country, saying: we need to look to the future and we need to underpin that with money.\u201d The government is preparing the Drought Resilience Funding Plan, which is a \u201crolling four-year high level framework\u201d that will guide which drought resilience projects are funded. What about the rest of the $7bn figure? Littleproud said the future fund was in addition to $2bn being spent \u201cin the here and now\u201d. Most of the remaining figure is attributed to $1bn in loans provided by the Regional Investment Corporation. Dubbed \u201cBarnaby\u2019s bank\u201d when it was established in 2018, the RIC has, as of April, received 97 applications and granted $69m in loans to farmers in need in rural and regional communities across Australia. The next biggest spending figure is $750m for the National Water Infrastructure Development Fund, which provides funding to state governments. Details of the projects that have been funded under this scheme can be found here. The figure also includes assistance that has gone directly to farmers, including $50m through the on-farm emergency water infrastructure rebate scheme, $183m through farm household allowance payments, $5m for rural financial counselling, and $130m for the drought communities program that gives grants to councils dealing with drought. Other measures include $3.1m for destocking, $15m for wild dog fencing and other pest and weed management, and $15m for a rural and regional renewal foundation. Tax concessions for farmers affected by drought, including accelerated fodder storage asset depreciation account for $75m of the figure. The government is also including funding for Bureau of Meteorology radars ($77m), Great Artesian Basin funding ($23m), regional weather and climate guides ($2.7m) and the National Drought Map ($4.2m) in the drought package figure. A telehealth measure for empowering communities is costing $26.9m and the Country Women\u2019s Association of Australia has received an additional $5m. The Joint Agency Drought Taskforce, which was established within the prime minster\u2019s office and led by major general Stephen Day, cost taxpayers $5.6m. Day\u2019s report has not been released. According to the 2019-20 budget, rural assistance spending between 2018-2019 and 2022-23 totals $1.6bn. Of this, $336m was spent last year. But the budget papers show the amount was expected to decrease by 13% in real terms from 2018-19 to 2019-20, and decrease by 22.4% in real terms over the period 2019-20 to 2022-23. While $336m was spent last year, this was budgeted to fall to $299m in 2019-20. It climbs again to an estimated $380m next year and $249m the year after that. According to the budget papers, the initial decrease from 2018-19 to 2019-20 mainly reflects the cessation of additional assistance through the Farm Household Allowance, including the Special Drought Supplement, which was announced in last year\u2019s midyear economic and financial outlook. The subsequent decrease from 2019-20 to 2022-23 mainly relates to the profile of expenses for concessional loans through the Regional Investment Corporation for both the north Queensland flood recovery effort and drought assistance. Is that it? Last week, the government announced an extra $100m for drought-hit communities, which it said was \u201con top of more than $7bn in drought support funding already provided by the government\u201d. As part of this, 13 extra local government areas will be provided up to $1m for local infrastructure and drought relief products, bringing the total number of councils to receive assistance up to 123. The latest round of funding has proven controversial given one south-west Victorian council, Moyne Shire, received the $1m boost despite not being in drought. Councillor Colin Ryan said the area was not drought-affected. \u201cWe don\u2019t need the money for drought reasons and I believe it should be redirected to more deserving areas of Australia,\u201d he told ABC radio. Littleproud has now asked for an audit of the selection criteria, but has defended the process, saying it is based on drought mapping by the Bureau of Meteorology. \u201cI\u2019ll be asking for a forensic audit by the bureau to make sure that data collection was right, but that\u2019s the science we predicate our decisions on,\u201d he said. Morrison said the government was happy to accept criticism for being \u201ctoo generous\u201d. \u201cIf we\u2019re being accused of being too supportive, too generous, too much on the front foot in helping rural districts when it comes to supporting them in the drought, well I\u2019m happy to take that criticism because we are on the front foot when it comes to helping our rural communities,\u201d Morrison said.",

The tabular iceberg, officially named D-28, separated from the ice shelf on 26 September. The iceberg is 1,636 square kilometres in size, or about 50 x 30km, the Australian Antarctic Division said. Ice shelves are platforms of floating ice that form where the Antarctic ice sheet meets the ocean. Working in a similar way to architectural buttresses, they hold back the flow of the grounded ice. The Amery ice shelf has an estimated floating ice area of 60,000 sq km and water penetrates over 550km underneath it. It is the first major calving event on the Amery ice shelf since 1963-64 although scientists said they did not believe it was linked to climate change. The calving occurred next to a location known as the \u201cloose tooth\u201d that scientists had been watching because the ice appeared to be precariously attached. Scientists from the Australian Antarctic program, the Institute of Marine and Antarctic Studies and Scripps Institution of Oceanography have been monitoring the site for almost 20 years. Helen Amanda Fricker, a Scripps professor, said scientists first noticed a rift at the front of the ice shelf in the early 2000s and had predicted a large iceberg would break off between 2010 and 2015. \u201cI am excited to see this calving event after all these years,\u201d she said. \u201cWe knew it would happen eventually, but just to keep us all on our toes, it is not exactly where we expected it to be.\u201d The Amery ice shelf is the third largest in Antarctica and is located between Australia\u2019s Davis and Mawson research stations. Researchers have been studying the ice shelf since the 1960s and currently have instruments on the ice that are measuring the impact of ocean melt and ice flow. Fricker said: \u201cIt\u2019s part of the ice shelf\u2019s normal cycle, where we see major calving events every 60-70 years.\u201d Ben Galton-Fenzi, a glaciologist with the Australian Antarctic Program, said the calving was detected through satellite imagery. \u201cThe calving will not directly affect sea level, because the ice shelf was already floating, much like an ice cube in a glass of water,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what will be interesting to see is how the loss of this ice will influence the ocean melting under the remaining ice shelf and the speed at which the ice flows off the continent.\u201d",
