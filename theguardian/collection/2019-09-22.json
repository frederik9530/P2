      "bodyText": "An assessment backed by the world\u2019s major climate science bodies has found commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions must be at least tripled and increased by up to fivefold if the world is to meet the goals of the 2015 Paris climate agreement. The report, launched as leaders gather at a UN climate action summit in New York on Monday, says current plans would lead to a rise in average global temperatures of between 2.9C and 3.4C by 2100, a shift likely to bring catastrophic change across the globe. Coordinated by the World Meteorological Organisation, the United in Science report says it is still possible to reduce the gap and keep global heating to a safe level, but it would require an urgent shift in commitments and action. The five years between 2015 and 2019 are on track to be on average 1.1C hotter than pre-industrial times and the warmest of any equivalent period on record. The report says many of the changes linked to the temperature rise, including long-lasting heatwaves, record-breaking wildfires, declining sea ice and glaciers, cyclones, floods and drought, have hit sooner and harder than predicted a decade ago. Speaking ahead of the summit, UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said the world was fraying and needed international cooperation more than ever. \u201cLet\u2019s face it, we have no time to lose,\u201d he said. Pep Canadell, the executive director of the Global Carbon Project and a contributing author on the report, said the report confirmed well-established trends, including that climate changes had accelerated in the past three decades, and particularly in the past 10 years. \u201cHow many climate records does it take to accept the unprecedented nature of what we are living and to act upon it?\u201d Millions of people took part in an unprecedented global demonstration on Friday demanding urgent action to tackle global heating , joining a movement started by Swedish teenage activist Greta Thunberg. Like the report, the strike was timed to put pressure on the leaders gathering for the climate summit, which is being held ahead of the annual UN general assembly. Leaders from about 60 countries are scheduled to speak at the summit, including India\u2019s Narendra Modi, Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel and Britain\u2019s Boris Johnson. Guterres asked leaders to come to the summit with new commitments to put the globe closer to meeting the Paris agreement goals of limiting global heating to at most 2C, and as close to 1.5C as possible, compared with pre-industrial levels. He said it required countries to cut emissions by 45% by 2030, end fossil fuel subsidies and ban new coal plants after 2020. Donald Trump, who has pledged to pull the US out of the Paris agreement, will not attend the summit. Australia will be represented by Marise Payne, the foreign affairs minister, despite the prime minister, Scott Morrison, being in the US this week, after Morrison refused to meet a request from Guterres that countries announce new commitments before attending. As leaders headed to New York on Sunday, Trump and Morrison opened an Ohio box factory owned by Australian Anthony Pratt. The United in Science report, which is also backed by the United Nations Environment Programme and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, estimates global emissions are not likely to peak before 2030 on the current trajectory. It says policies to reduce emissions must triple to meet the 2C target and increase fivefold to keep heating to within 1.5C. A separate report to be released on Monday has found emissions from coal power would need to peak next year and fall to zero by 2040 if the world is to meet the Paris goals. For developed countries that have the capacity to move more rapidly to cleaner sources, such as Australia, the US and those in western Europe, it would mean ending coal use for electricity by 2031. Less developed countries would need to shut their coal plants across the following decade. There has been a shift away from investors backing new coal developments, reflected in a 75% fall in the number of new plants planned across the globe since 2015, but the analysis by Berlin-based Climate Analytics said cancelling new projects was not enough. According to the International Energy Agency, emissions from coal power rose 2.9% in 2018 and account for nearly a third of global carbon dioxide pollution. \u201cGovernments now need to introduce effective regulation to shut down coal power plants well before the end of their technical lifetime and considerably reduce their use in the meantime,\u201d Paola Yanguas Parra, from Climate Analytics, said. Yanguas Parra said the date at which coal would need to be phased out to give the world a chance of limiting warming to 1.5C had been brought forward following an assessment by the IPCC last year and because governments had not tackled coal use adequately since the 2015 Paris summit. \u2022 This article was amended on 1 October 2019 because an earlier version misdescribed the 2015 Paris agreement goal of limiting global heating to at most 2C above the pre-industrial era, as limiting global heating to at least 2C above the pre-industrial era.

      "bodyText": "More than 8 million people, equivalent to the population of London, are living in unsuitable housing in England, according to analysis suggesting the scale of the housing crisis could be far worse than officially estimated. Research by Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh suggests the lives of one in eight people in England are now negatively affected by years of fast-rising prices and missed house-building targets. The research shows that 3.6 million people are living in overcrowded homes, 2.5 million cannot properly afford where they live, the same number again are living with parents or relatives against their wishes and almost 1.4 million are living in poor or substandard conditions, according to the study commissioned by the National Housing Federation (NHF), which represents social landlords. It adds up to almost twice the number of people currently considered to be in need of housing on official waiting lists. The needy include couples forced to cohabit despite a relationship breakdown and \u201cboomerang\u201d adults who return to their parents because they cannot afford to buy or rent or have been made homeless. The NHF said England needed 340,000 new homes a year to tackle the problem, but the last time that had happened was in 1968 during Harold Wilson\u2019s premiership. In the year to March 2019, 169,770 new homes were built in England. \u201cToday\u2019s research reveals the full enormity of the housing crisis,\u201d said Kate Henderson, the chief executive of the NHF. \u201cIt is the single biggest domestic issue we face.

But hopes are modest that Boris Johnson\u2019s government will be radical after he listed housing far beneath other domestic priorities in his first speech as prime minister. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government responded that housing was a priority and said: \u201cLast year we built more homes than in all but one of the last 31 years.\u201d However that was only true for England, and across the UK the latest figures for 2017-18 show that eight years since 1987 had higher output. Only one in six new homes being built are affordable homes for rent, despite it being the market sector the majority of analysts believe is in most need of urgent supply. The ministry said 2,440 council houses had been built between 2010-11 and 2017-18, an increase on the New Labour output but a drop in the ocean compared to the NHF\u2019s estimate that 90,000 new council homes are needed every year for the next decade to help end the crisis.

      "bodyText": "Students starting university are this week being warned of the dangers of initiation ceremonies, almost three years after an undergraduate was killed as a result of the \u201ctoxic effects\u201d of such events. Ed Farmer died after excessive drinking at an initiation event run by Newcastle University\u2019s agricultural society in 2016. Karen Dilks, the coroner at the inquest into his death, called on universities to issue more forceful warnings about the dangers of alcohol for first-year students. As part of its response, Newcastle University worked with Universities UK to publish guidance about the potential physical risks of initiation ceremonies and the bullying and coercion that can be involved. At the time of the inquest, Farmer\u2019s parents expressed frustration at the \u201cinactivity\u201d of the university and its student union over initiation ceremonies. But in a foreword to the Initiations at UK Universities guidance, Jeremy and Helen Farmer say they hope the document could save lives. They write: \u201cIf students were made aware of the dangers of drinking large volumes of spirits in short periods of time and maybe aware of the signs of someone that is no longer just drunk but in a life-limiting state, and use the example of Ed to give the message some relevance, then possibly just one student might be luckier on a night out than Ed.\u201d The guidance stops short of calling for an outright ban on initiation ceremonies as some parents have suggested. Instead it seeks to raise awareness among students and staff of risky behaviour involved in initiation ceremoniesincluding advertising support available to students. It claims that a blanket ban would be \u201cunhelpful\u201d because it could encourage initiation ceremonies \u201cinto private spaces, such as off-campus accommodation\u201d where they would be more dangerous and difficult to monitor. ProfChris Day, the vice-chancellor of Newcastle University, said: \u201cThe situation Ed found himself in that night which led to him drinking an excessive quantity of alcohol over a very short period of time, together with a lack of knowledge from his fellow students about the dangers of drinking to excess, resulted in the most tragic of outcomes. \u201cWe all wish we could rewind three years and change what happened that night. But we can\u2019t go back and so, instead, we are looking forward and doing everything we can to minimise the chances of anything like this happening again.\u201d He pointed out that such deaths were \u201cvanishingly rare\u201d and added: \u201cSometimes physical but often mental damage can be done by attending these events, where you are coerced or bullied into doing things you don\u2019t want to do\u201d. \u201cIt could be excess alcohol, it might be ingesting something horrible and toxic or it might be drug-related, it might be getting them to walk along the parapet of a bridge. It could be anything like that which has an element of coercion, forcing or bullying which we are trying to stamp out.\u201d He said that the behaviour typically occurred with junior students being coerced by more senior students and that, while much attention is placed on freshers\u2019 week, these types of events are just as likely to happen at other times.

The government announcement covers Britons in the bloc who are retired, students, employees of UK companies or on holiday when Brexit happens. Visitors who fall ill or have accidents on holiday or on short stays in the EU are currently covered by the European health insurance card, but this will no longer be valid in a no-deal scenario. Also invalidated by a crash out would be the S1 reciprocal healthcare scheme used by an estimated 180,000 pensioners who paid their taxes in the UK but decided to retire elsewhere in the bloc, apart from Ireland where existing arrangements would continue. The offer by the government in March to cover costs for just one year for treatment agreed or started before exit day prompted fury, with some Britons in the EU questioning what would happen if they fell sick after the UK left the union. One Briton, retired to France, claimed at the time it was discrimination. \u201cWhy should I be treated any differently from any other retired government servant living in the UK?\u201d Questions remain unanswered about what will happen in the longer term to those who opted to retire abroad in the knowledge that reciprocal arrangements applied throughout the EU as part of EU membership if there is no deal. The government has proposed continuing the reciprocal arrangement until the end of December 2020 with all EU member states, but no bilateral deals can be signed until the outcome of Brexit negotiations is known.",

Andrew Bridgen, AKA Spud-U-Hate, in Tories at War</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pro Co/Publicity Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>",
      "body": "<p>A former potato farmer turned Brexit-backing Tory MP, Andrew Bridgen is nicknamed Spud-U-Hate by his foes. It fell to him to explain, in <a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/programmes/tories-at-war\" title=\"\">Tories at War</a> (Channel 4), how he and his fellow uber tubers in the Conservative party elect their leader. First the candidates form a circle. Then they take up their weapons. The circular firing squad ends when the candidates are eliminated \u2013 leaving, Bridgen fancifully imagined, \u201ca nun from the Outer Hebrides to become leader\u201d. If only. The problem, in retrospect, was that only 11 Conservatives stood this summer to lead their party. If only all of them had stood, and been eliminated, we wouldn\u2019t be in such a mess. Given that the Na h-Eileanan an Iar constituency that includes the Outer Hebrides elected a Scottish Nationalist last time round, most likely that nun would not have prorogued parliament but revoked article 50, thus wiping the insufferable smile I had to endure watching this show from the face of the par-boiled spudleiter of the Brexit party.</p> <p>The point of this hour was to bear witness to how, since Theresa May\u2019s election, the most successful democratic party in the world (or so ex-minister Alan Duncan called it) got blighted by potato politicians. The civil war would have been fun to watch were it not for the fact that the rest of us are in its crossfire. Tories at War showed that Britons in 2019 are not so much lions led by donkeys as couch potatoes ruled by red-skinned, elite potatoes bred in top vegetable academies in the Thames valley.</p> <p>Duncan, who started the programme in January as minister for Europe, ended it wondering if the lettuce in his sandwich was the last greenery he would consume as a consequence of no-deal Brexit. A little over the top, Alan: just as there are academies for producing potato politicians, so there will be lettuce farms in Brexit Britain.</p> <p>The problem of the programme is that the war isn\u2019t over and the collateral damage has scarcely started. The pleasure of the programme was watching Tory grandees get it wrong in hindsight. Nicholas Soames began the year airily scotching the ludicrous possibility of Boris Johnson as leader; he ended here chucked out of the Conservative party by PM Johnson for defying the whip to prevent a no-deal Brexit. Even Bridgen thought removing the whip from rebel Tories was bonkers: Johnson, the \u201cMidlands Machiavelli\u201d reckoned, had left the \u201crats nowhere to run\u201d.</p> <p>There was an absence at the heart of the show. It was David Cameron, who, we can now see, was to the Tory party what Marshal Tito was to the Balkans.

      "bodyText": "A former potato farmer turned Brexit-backing Tory MP, Andrew Bridgen is nicknamed Spud-U-Hate by his foes. It fell to him to explain, in Tories at War (Channel 4), how he and his fellow uber tubers in the Conservative party elect their leader. First the candidates form a circle. Then they take up their weapons. The circular firing squad ends when the candidates are eliminated \u2013 leaving, Bridgen fancifully imagined, \u201ca nun from the Outer Hebrides to become leader\u201d. If only. The problem, in retrospect, was that only 11 Conservatives stood this summer to lead their party. If only all of them had stood, and been eliminated, we wouldn\u2019t be in such a mess. Given that the Na h-Eileanan an Iar constituency that includes the Outer Hebrides elected a Scottish Nationalist last time round, most likely that nun would not have prorogued parliament but revoked article 50, thus wiping the insufferable smile I had to endure watching this show from the face of the par-boiled spudleiter of the Brexit party. The point of this hour was to bear witness to how, since Theresa May\u2019s election, the most successful democratic party in the world (or so ex-minister Alan Duncan called it) got blighted by potato politicians. The civil war would have been fun to watch were it not for the fact that the rest of us are in its crossfire. Tories at War showed that Britons in 2019 are not so much lions led by donkeys as couch potatoes ruled by red-skinned, elite potatoes bred in top vegetable academies in the Thames valley. Duncan, who started the programme in January as minister for Europe, ended it wondering if the lettuce in his sandwich was the last greenery he would consume as a consequence of no-deal Brexit. A little over the top, Alan: just as there are academies for producing potato politicians, so there will be lettuce farms in Brexit Britain. The problem of the programme is that the war isn\u2019t over and the collateral damage has scarcely started. The pleasure of the programme was watching Tory grandees get it wrong in hindsight. Nicholas Soames began the year airily scotching the ludicrous possibility of Boris Johnson as leader; he ended here chucked out of the Conservative party by PM Johnson for defying the whip to prevent a no-deal Brexit. Even Bridgen thought removing the whip from rebel Tories was bonkers: Johnson, the \u201cMidlands Machiavelli\u201d reckoned, had left the \u201crats nowhere to run\u201d. There was an absence at the heart of the show. It was David Cameron, who, we can now see, was to the Tory party what Marshal Tito was to the Balkans. Say what you want about the authoritarian leader, but at least, as civil war ravaged Yugoslavia, he was dead and so not around to flog his self-justifying memoir and offload his responsibility for the debacle on to his successors. There were other voids too. The other two calamitous organ grinders \u2013 May and Johnson \u2013 were also unavailable, so we got various monkeys \u2013 Rees-Mogg, Soames, Soubry, Spudleiter, Spud-U-Hate, Duncan.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has unveiled a combined \u00a31.2bn in funding for new efforts to tackle the climate emergency and protect endangered species as he prepares to attend the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations in New York. While at the UN general assembly, the prime minister will use a speech to announce \u00a31bn in aid money for UK inventors to seek funding for high-tech initiatives connected to areas such as renewable energy and lower levels of pollutants. He will separately announce a \u00a3220m fund to tackle the erosion of biodiversity, focusing on desperately endangered species such as the black rhino and Sumatran tiger. Downing Street hopes Johnson\u2019s environment speech will be the highlight of a trip that is likely to be dominated by questions about Brexit, but the plans prompted a withering response from Greenpeace, which said it amounted to \u201ca flop\u201d in terms of world leadership on the issue and fell well short of the vision required.` The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) charity, which will be hosting the UN event at which Johnson will announce the biodiversity fund, praised the plan but warned that focusing only on technological solutions for the climate emergency would not be sufficient. The \u00a31bn innovation fund is billed as seeking \u201cthe latest cutting-edge tech\u201d in areas such as sustainable electricity supplies for developing countries, improved battery technology and ways for heavily polluting industries such as steel and cement to reduce emissions. Coming from the aid budget, the fund is named after Hertha Ayrton, a pioneering Victorian-era physicist and engineer, who was also a passionate suffragette and whose daughter, Barbara Ayrton-Gould, was a Labour MP at the time of the Attlee government. Announcing the new biodiversity fund with what is described as an initial \u00a3220m in funding, Johnson was expected to warn that species and habitats were vanishing faster than at any other time in history. The money will be targeted at better law enforcement to protect environments, prevent poaching and hamper the trade in illegal wildlife goods. Speaking before the UN meeting, to which he was heading on Sunday, Johnson said he had \u201calways been deeply optimistic about the potential of technology to make the world a better place\u201d. He said: \u201cIf we get this right, future generations will look back on climate change as a problem that we solved by determined global action and the prowess of technology.\u201d On biodiversity, he said: \u201cIt is a privilege to share our planet with such majestic beasts as the African elephant, the black rhino and the beautiful pangolin.

Dani Carvajal was excellent for Real, as was Eden Hazard on his first La Liga start. Benzema\u2019s goal was a result of a wonderful lofted cross by Carvajal after good work by Gareth Bale. Bale almost doubled Real\u2019s lead late on but the forward could only find the side netting in stoppage-time. Sevilla, whose unbeaten run comes to an end on home soil, had a hatful of chances to equalise, with Luuk de Jong guilty of passing up the best of them for Julen Lopetegui\u2019s side. Lucas Ocampos, it has to be said, was very impressive in defeat for the hosts. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73f8ffb699138d9ef5703959057bca34d5bb1230\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73f8ffb699138d9ef5703959057bca34d5bb1230/0_0_5000_3328/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Benzema celebrates.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Benzema celebrates.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aitor Alcalde/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-22T21:28:37.291Z\">at 10.28pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d87de2e8f08f30dc5bc061a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-22T20:48:51.286Z\">9.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>90 min:</strong> There will be four added minutes.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-22T20:49:00.993Z\">at 9.49pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d87ddd58f08f9df5bdd96e3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-22T20:48:37.075Z\">9.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>90 min: </strong>Lucas V\u00e1zquez replaces Hazard, who impressed on his first La Liga start, luring defenders into wayward tackles and wriggling beyond the Sevilla back line.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d87dd3f8f08f30dc5bc0616\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-22T20:46:36.091Z\">9.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>87 min:</strong> Javier Hern\u00e1ndez has the ball in the net \u2013 but the Mexican strayed a yard or so offside.

Saying that, Barcelona\u2019s shock defeat at Granada has certainly eased the immediate focus. But the Champions League is regarded as the be all and end all for the club\u2019s hierarchy after spending more than \u20ac350m on summer recruits to push them closer to regaining that crown, a competition they won last year. Real are likely to be revved up, while an unbeaten Sevilla side have been quietly impressive, with the former Real striker Javier Hern\u00e1ndez notching against Qarabag in midweek. \u201cThere are always difficult moments at a club like Real Madrid, but I am happy that we can overcome them,\u201d Zidane said this week ahead of facing a Sevilla team coached by Julen Lopetegui, who took charge of just 14 Real games before being sacked in October. \u201cWhat is said about me, or the club, from outside does not matter to me,\u201d added Zidane. \u201cWe are united here and we have a strength from with the club. I don\u2019t feel questioned, I am happy with what I am doing. Pressure in these situations is normal, it would be strange if there was no pressure.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Kick-off:</strong> 8pm (BST)</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s the match report. Karim Benzema\u2019s fifth goal is the difference as Zinedine Zidane\u2019s bounce back from defeat to PSG in midweek with a solid performance in Sevilla. Dani Carvajal was excellent for Real, as was Eden Hazard on his first La Liga start. Benzema\u2019s goal was a result of a wonderful lofted cross by Carvajal after good work by Gareth Bale. Bale almost doubled Real\u2019s lead late on but the forward could only find the side netting in stoppage-time. Sevilla, whose unbeaten run comes to an end on home soil, had a hatful of chances to equalise, with Luuk de Jong guilty of passing up the best of them for Julen Lopetegui\u2019s side. Lucas Ocampos, it has to be said, was very impressive in defeat for the hosts. 90 min: There will be four added minutes. 90 min: Lucas V\u00e1zquez replaces Hazard, who impressed on his first La Liga start, luring defenders into wayward tackles and wriggling beyond the Sevilla back line. 87 min: Javier Hern\u00e1ndez has the ball in the net \u2013 but the Mexican strayed a yard or so offside. It was a deft finish at the front post, which was enough to fool Thibaut Courtois whether he meant it or not, but no goal was very much the right decision. Real are off the hook. 84 min: Sevilla get Ocampos in again down the right. The winger overcooks his cross, with Reguil\u00f3n failing to keep it alive. Real are plugging away but they\u2019re seemingly happy with their lot. They are not too inent on finding a second. 82 min: Lopetegui goes for broke, with Nolito on in place of the defender Carri\u00e7o. Zidane, in the opposing technical area, urges calm. 81 min: Ocampos \u2013 again \u2013 works wonders down the right before flashing a ball across the six-yard box. The winger does everything right \u2013 but neither Hern\u00e1ndez nor Luuk de Jong are there to meet it. Lopetegui is pulling his hair out. 77 min: Close! Ocampos, who has been at the heart of almost every Sevilla attack, plays a brilliant ball in from the right, Ferland Mendy inadvertently helps the ball on but De Jong cannot direct a header goalwards. Another chance goes begging for De Jong. 76 min: Federico Valverde replaces James. Will Eden Hazard complete his first 90 minutes in a Real shirt? 74 min: Hazard skips past two Sevilla challenges but not Carri\u00e7o, who acts as a roadblock on halfway. The hosts come forward but Ocampos goes to ground under pressure from Sergio Ramos, who frantically waves his finger at the referee, dismissing any thought of a foul. The referee, this time, agrees. Nothing doing. 70 min: Luuk de Jong glances just wide! Sevilla could not go too much closer to an equaliser. It all stemmed from a free-kick, which Hazard was guilty of giving away 25 yards from goal. It was poor in itself but Sevilla recycled the ball and De Jong did well to get a faint touch on a high cross. It bobbles just wide. Real survive. 69 min: Javier Hern\u00e1ndez, the former Real forward, replaces Joan Jordan, who was on a yellow. Hern\u00e1ndez will presumably operate alongside Luuk de Jong, a little and large combination of sorts. 67 min: That goal has knocked the stuffing out of Sevilla, who are readying a change down on the touchline. Karim Benzema heads in his fifth goal of the season, converting a wonderful cross by Dani Carvajal. Benzema eludes his marker and steadies himself to nod a hanging ball back across goal, beyond Vacl\u00edk. It was a better finish than he will get credit for. 61 min: Ocampos is played in down the right, he knocks the ball beyond Sergio Ramos and the Real Madrid defender is lured into making a stereotypically cynical foul. Ramos obstructs Ocampos from reaching the ball and the referee swiftly dishes out a deserved yellow card. 60 min: Jes\u00fas Navas is slipped through on the right, he races on to the ball but there is Casemiro, sliding across, to intervene. Real then play out from the back, with Kroos neatly knitting together a move upfield but Benzema gives it away. Back come Sevilla, and the home supporters sense something is stirring. 59 min: Another meaningful Hazard sprint, another Sevilla foul, this time by Jes\u00fas Navas. 56 min: Jordan clips Hazard on halfway. Eden Hazard has not been his electrifying best but the Belgium forward has certainly made an impression. He forced a good save out of Vacl\u00edk in the first half and has been at the heart of every positive and promising Real burst forward. 54 min: Dani Carvajal clears yet another Sevilla corner. Ocampos recycles possession and jinks past Kroos but Bale is there to head away. 53 min: Hazard is slipped in down the Real left and Joan Jordan is always up against it. Out of ideas to halt his man, Jordan not only tugs at Hazard\u2019s shirt but almost rips it off him altogether. Jordan gets a booking for his efforts. 52 min: An early second-half change for Sevilla, with Oliver Torres replacing Franco V\u00e1zquez. 51 min: Javier Hern\u00e1ndez is among those warming up for Sevilla. It has been a fairly slack start to the second half by Julen Lopetegui\u2019s men. Real are in the driving seat. 49 min: Bale whips a cross in .. but James Rodr\u00edguez cannot get on the end of it. Real Madrid steam forward, Bale sends a cross whizzing in to the back post, where James is lurking, in acres of space. He jumps but cannot get anything on it. It\u2019s just as well from a Sevilla perspective, because all of their defence were static, having stopped on the edge of the 18-yard box. 47 min: Hazard does superbly to take the sting out of a Sevilla attack. The hosts freed Reguil\u00f3n down the left before they worked it to the right, where Ocampos made light work of beating his man. But just as it seemed Real were in trouble, Hazard swivels away from danger in the box and coolly picks out a team-mate in lime green. 46 min: Karim Benzema gets the second half started in Sevilla. No changes at the interval. An even contest. Eden Hazard had a snapshot repelled by Vacl\u00edk, before Dani Carvajal almost started and finished a slick Real move. Sevilla have more than held their own, giving Real plenty to think about without really putting Zinedine Zidane\u2019s side under the cosh. Julen Lopetegui, the former Real manager who was booked for gesturing to the referee to book Gareth Bale for a tackle, heads straight down the steps on the sound of the whistle. 45 min: There will be one added minute. 43 min: Ocampos fouls Casemiro at the corner, in turn gifting Real Madrid control approaching the interval. 42 min: Franco V\u00e1zquez and Carvajal are both permitted to return to the field after a spot of treatment. As play resumes, Ramos wellies the ball into Row Z before Mendy lashes the ball out for another corner, Sevilla\u2019s eighth of this half. 39 min: Mendy catches Jes\u00fas Navas with a wandering elbow and Sevilla get a free-kick out of it. It was a foul but nothing more \u2013 there did not appear to be any malice behind it. Seconds later, Franco V\u00e1zquez and Carvajal clash heads. 38 min: Dani Carvajal goes close! The Real full-back does superbly to seize the ball back in central midfield and then nudges the ball inside, before James releases the defender, freeing him to race through on goal. He tries to slot the ball across goal but Vacl\u00edk is equal to it. Strong save. In the aftermath, Real earn a free-kick 35 yards out as James is upended but Bale fails to truly test Vacl\u00edk. 34 min: Real come alive, robbing Sevilla of possession 30 yards from goal and Hazard forces a save out of Vacl\u00edk! Benzema does really well before sliding in Hazard, who drives at the near post instead of trying to pick out James arriving in the box. You cannot really fault him for having a pop there. 32 min: Sevilla earn a sixth corner \u2013 but Luuk de Jong cannot hit the target. He rises highest in the box, getting above Toni Kroos but De Jong cannot divert it goalwards. 28 min: Julen Lopetegui just cannot help himself. The Sevilla coach, who seemingly has a bit of pent-up anger, stalking the touchline from minute one, receives a yellow card after asking the referee to book Gareth Bale for a challenge on Reguil\u00f3n. Juan Mart\u00ednez Munuera rushed over to Lopetegui to book the Sevilla manager, who had previously gestured for a Real player to go into his book. The Real supporters will enjoy that one. 26 min: Banega smiles after picking up a yellow card for a late challenge on James Rodr\u00edguez on halfway. 25 min: James dips in to do some more all-important dirty work as Sevilla look to pen in Real once more. The hosts are growing into this game. Real are certainly not having it all their own way. 23 min: Sevilla win a fifth corner \u2013 and they cause a moment\u2019s havoc. It was a dangerous cross in, Real failed to truly clear their lines with a loose ball causing problems. When Real do clear, Carlos makes a smart sliding challenge on Hazard. 22 min: Carvajal\u2019s low cross is blocked by Reguil\u00f3n and Real Madrid win a corner! It all stemmed from some clever and probing buildup play by Eden Hazard and Gareth Bale, with the latter cutting inside to switch play. That freed Carvajal to maraud into acres of space down the right and get to the byline to zip a ball across goal. But Real waste the resulting corner. 20 min: Dani Carvajal goes into the referee\u2019s book for a clumsy challenge on Ocampos. No complaints. 18 min: This time, Ocampos succeeds in winning a corner, as the ball deflects off Casemiro. Sevilla play it short and Banega\u2019s cross needs to be dealt with. They then recycle possession but Courtois is first on the scene to hoover it up. Real Madrid build down the right through Gareth Bale, who cuts inside. Patient play, with Kroos and James combining on halfway. 16 min: Carvajal does really well to fend off Ocampos under pressure and prevent Sevilla from buying a cheap corner. Instead, Real get a goal-kick and Courtois can boot it upfield. 14 min: Sergio Ramos, who left Sevilla for Real Madrid in 2005, is getting mullered every time he picks the ball up. Ramos has, of course, heard it all before but the locals certainly haven\u2019t forgotten how he left his boyhood club. They have no desire to give him a quiet night at the office. 12 min: Anything you can do, I can do better, say Real, as they zoom upfield and win a corner after Sevilla clean up following a hanging Carvajal cross from the right in search of Gareth Bale. James takes the set piece but it is disappointing, forcing Real to rebuild from halfway. 10 min: Sevilla win yet another corner \u2013 but the overhead kick by Carlos was ambitious. A chance for Real to get a foothold. 9 min: That ought to give Sevilla plenty of cause for encouragement. Real are just trying to settle things down and successfully do so, with Casemiro and Carvajal knocking the ball about, playing a neat one-two, with Bale also on the scene. 6 min: Sergio Ramos averts the danger! Brilliant headed clearance by the Real defender, to glance away an inviting Sevilla cross from the left. A genuine fright for Real. When the ball comes back in from a corner, Courtois is caught in no man\u2019s land and Luuk de Jong gets crowded out. The ball appears to strike Varane\u2019s right hand amid all of that, but it was cannoned at him as a result of a bit of pinball in the area. 5 min: Kroos dinks a cross in towards the back post, where Gareth Bale is lurking and Sevilla nudge the ball out to safety for a corner. But, when Real recycle possession, a decent cross flies into the box but Benzema cannot direct his header on target. 4 min: Fernando is pulled up for a foul on Casemiro, around 30 yards out. Toni Kroos is among the interested parties ... 3 min: Hazard enjoys a couple of fleeting touches as Real surge upfield. Bale and Benzema are both then involved before Mendy floats a ball in from the left but the former has no chance of reaching that, a severely overcooked cross. 1 min: Jes\u00fas Navas plays an early ball over the top of the Real defence and Mendy calmly allows it to run for Courtois to gather. Sevilla have had plenty of the early possession. Sevilla get things started. There is a decent volume inside the Ram\u00f3n S\u00e1nchez Pizju\u00e1n Stadium \u2013 Sevilla are well up for this one. We are just the pre-match handshakes and a couple of other formalities away from the off. Here we go, then ... The Real motley crew. Kick-off is six minutes away: So, a first La Liga start for Eden Hazard. How will the forward fare? Hazard has played 100 minutes in a Real Madrid shirt since joining from Chelsea for \u00a389m this summer and, alongside Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema, the Belgium international has another chance to impress after being upstaged by a former Real forward, \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda, on Wednesday. At Stamford Bridge earlier, Chelsea fans passed a giant Hazard banner round the stadium, which is kind of cute. Hazard will hope to leave a similar legacy at Real: A gentle reminder of Saturday\u2019s goings-on: The leading scorer in La Liga? Villarreal\u2019s Gerard Moreno: Sevilla were given a warm reception on arrival at Ram\u00f3n S\u00e1nchez Pizju\u00e1n Stadium, where Real Madrid are bidding to end the former\u2019s unbeaten start to the season. As for coming up against his former club, Julen Lopetegui has been rather nonplussed about the whole shebang, insisting the emphasis on his players to do the business \u2013 not Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane or indeed himself. \u201cThere is no room for extra motivation when you coach Sevilla, something I can hopefully do for many years,\u201d Lopetegui said. \u201cThere are three points at stake and that is enough motivation, even if we know the impact of facing Real Madrid. I always have a very good memory of all the clubs where I have been, as I stay with the positive. I try to be responsible and ambitious, and [Sunday] will be no exception. The central characters are the players, not the coaches.\u201d Essential pre-match reading, courtesy of Barney Ronay: Sevilla (4-3-3): Vacl\u00edk; Jes\u00fas Navas, Carlos, Carri\u00e7o, Reguil\u00f3n; Fernando, Jord\u00e1n, Banega; Ocampos, Franco V\u00e1zquez, De Jong Subs: Bounou, Nolito, Kounde, Hern\u00e1ndez, Gudelj, Escudero, Torres Real Madrid (4-3-3): Courtois; Carvajal, Sergio Ramos, Varane, Mendy; Casemiro, Kroos, James Rodr\u00edguez; Hazard, Benzema, Bale Subs: Areola, Milit\u00e3o, Nacho, Valverde, Lucas, Jovic, Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior Referee: Juan Mart\u00ednez Munuera Real Madrid have come unstuck just once this season, at Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday but nevertheless Zinedine Zidane is reportedly already under pressure to add some swagger to a low-key start to the season. Saying that, Barcelona\u2019s shock defeat at Granada has certainly eased the immediate focus. But the Champions League is regarded as the be all and end all for the club\u2019s hierarchy after spending more than \u20ac350m on summer recruits to push them closer to regaining that crown, a competition they won last year. Real are likely to be revved up, while an unbeaten Sevilla side have been quietly impressive, with the former Real striker Javier Hern\u00e1ndez notching against Qarabag in midweek. \u201cThere are always difficult moments at a club like Real Madrid, but I am happy that we can overcome them,\u201d Zidane said this week ahead of facing a Sevilla team coached by Julen Lopetegui, who took charge of just 14 Real games before being sacked in October. \u201cWhat is said about me, or the club, from outside does not matter to me,\u201d added Zidane. \u201cWe are united here and we have a strength from with the club. I don\u2019t feel questioned, I am happy with what I am doing. Pressure in these situations is normal, it would be strange if there was no pressure.\u201d Kick-off: 8pm (BST)",

      "body": "<p>Poor Tommy Shelby; the one man he can\u2019t defeat is himself. An episode that began with him accepting pep talks from Winston Churchill ended in a full-blown existential crisis.</p> <p>But while the show\u2019s protagonist almost certainly won\u2019t kill himself between series \u2013 my money is on time on the road taking Charlie\u2019s gypsy walking cure \u2013 I did genuinely enjoy this gloomier-than-usual finale and how the storyline ultimately played out.</p> <p>That\u2019s largely because there was something refreshing about the fact that Tommy didn\u2019t get it right, that he was undone, that his ever-ticking mind began to falter.</p> <p>This hasn\u2019t been a perfect series (although I have personally enjoyed it) but one thing that has been beautifully handled has been Tommy\u2019s impending breakdown. The crisis has been coming since the opening episode and when it finally arrived, with Tommy genuinely unclear how he had lost and Mosley won, it rang absolutely true.</p> <p>That said, while I generally prefer the more talky episodes of Peaky and downbeat series endings, I\u2019m sure more than one viewer will have felt this conclusion set up more questions than it gave answers, as well as going round in circles (particularly where Arthur\u2019s story was concerned) just when it needed to build impetus the most.</p> <p>I did also wonder if Peaky Blinders increasingly needs more time to tell its story. Would another couple of episodes have allowed us to learn more about Gina or the Chinese, to spend more time with Polly and Aberama, to see a bit more of Jessie Eden or feel the gut-punch of poor Finn\u2019s mistake more clearly?</p> <h2><strong>Our heroes</strong></h2> <p>Oh Finn, didn\u2019t Arthur make it very clear that you should never tell your business to anyone outside the family, no matter how congenial they might seem? If you had the youngest and most inexperienced Shelby in the unintentional Fredo Corleone role, stick your hand up and I\u2019ll direct you to the now barman-less Garrison to collect your winnings.</p> <p>Not that things are looking much better for the rest of the family, after Michael drew power from Gina\u2019s brain cells to launch his bid for control of the family via the Chinese heroin trade with a wonderfully patronising speech about the new generation taking control and letting the old dogs head off to a \u2018legitimate\u2019 retirement.</p> <p>I admire Michael\u2019s impressive ability to convince himself he\u2019s so much smarter than he actually is, though in reality I suspect Gina\u2019s family will keep him around just as long as they need him and not a second more.</p> <p>I also wish he wasn\u2019t Polly\u2019s blind spot. While it makes sense that she chose son over nephew, it\u2019s more than a little depressing that she can\u2019t see Michael\u2019s thoughtless arrogance for what it is.</p> <h2><strong>The bad guys</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"184abfe8cc25fcf80dc9741211b32f75f4fa7488\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/184abfe8cc25fcf80dc9741211b32f75f4fa7488/0_77_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"It was never going to end any other way ... Oswald Mosley (Sam Clafin).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">It was never going to end any other way ... Oswald Mosley (Sam Clafin).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Viglasky/BBC/Caryn Mandabach Productions</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And so the great plot to kill Mosley fell apart at the seams. In truth it was never going to end any other way \u2013 and this is the problem with casting real-life figures as antagonists. While it might take the odd liberty, Peaky Blinders is not a show that messes with reality so there was no way Tommy\u2019s assassination could come off.</p> <p>Instead, the interest was always going to lie in just how it fell apart \u2013 and I did very much enjoy that, from Finn\u2019s slip to the murder of Barney and the ambushing of Aberama (alas poor Polly, ever unlucky in love).</p> <p>My favourite moment, however, came as Tommy, who has never looked so defeated or so small, stared out at his best laid plans falling apart only for Mosley to mutter: \u201cI think it\u2019s about time you got off the stage old man.\u201d</p> <p>Time is passing and the entire episode was focused on informing Tommy that he should exit stage left. But if we know anything about the middle Shelby brother it\u2019s that he hates being told what to do. I predict not a riot but a resurgence in series six.</p> <h2><strong>Old friends</strong></h2> <p>As I mentioned last week, if ever a man would have a taste for a spot of resurrection it\u2019s Alfie Solomons. And so it came to pass, as Tom Hardy popped by to inject a welcome note of hammy insanity into proceedings, while also providing Tommy with a vision of what his life might be like should he choose to quit the game.</p> <p>Did we need the scene with Alfie? Probably not, but it was a great deal of fun and I loved the little touches \u2013 from Alfie\u2019s doormat spelling out Lethe in honour of the river to the Greek underworld, to the fact that he spends his time shooting seagulls and would prefer not to hurt his dog by having it return to him.</p> <h2><strong>Notes from the boardroom</strong></h2> <p>\u2022 A sad goodbye to Aberama Gold, brutally murdered, and just as I was coming to truly appreciate you too. This wasn\u2019t the best of seasons for the Peaky women\u2019s lovers.</p> <p>\u2022 The conversation with Charlie might have been my favourite of the episode \u2013 if only because it confirmed my suspicions that he\u2019d always been in love with Tommy\u2019s mother.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c47e2eb9f267cb448b6b5c540ae6aba028044948\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c47e2eb9f267cb448b6b5c540ae6aba028044948/0_77_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Poor doomed Barney (Cosmo Jarvis).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Poor doomed Barney (Cosmo Jarvis).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Viglasky/BBC/Caryn Mandabach Productions</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u2022 His appearance may have been brief but I did enjoy Cosmo Jarvis\u2019s turn as poor, doomed Barney.</p> <p>\u2022 No Lizzy or Ada this week. I missed them both.</p> <p>\u2022 I don\u2019t know about you guys but I think old Grace is quite a malevolent shade \u2026</p> <h2><strong>Anachronistic yet strangely right song of the week</strong></h2> <p>Nice use of Mercury-nominated Idles\u2019 Never Fight a Man with a Perm during Mosley\u2019s rally and I loved Richard Hawley\u2019s cover of Bob Dylan\u2019s Ballad of a Thin Man. But I have to give this to Anna Calvi, whose soundtrack has held the whole series together, providing a suitably spooky accompaniment to Tommy\u2019s breakdown.</p> <h2><strong>Quote of the week</strong></h2> <p>\u201cSince my resurrection I\u2019m considered to be a god in the Holy Land. Someone has made an image of me out of rock, embedded in the sand so I am told, and I am planning to make a pilgrimage to stand in my own shadow.\u201d It might be ludicrous to see him back from the dead but I still love the way Alfie tells them \u2026</p> <p><em>Finally, thank you all for coming below the line, laying down theories, getting carried away, fed up and, at times, furious. </em><em>Here\u2019s to a short wait till Peaky Blinders: series six.

      "bodyText": "Poor Tommy Shelby; the one man he can\u2019t defeat is himself. An episode that began with him accepting pep talks from Winston Churchill ended in a full-blown existential crisis. But while the show\u2019s protagonist almost certainly won\u2019t kill himself between series \u2013 my money is on time on the road taking Charlie\u2019s gypsy walking cure \u2013 I did genuinely enjoy this gloomier-than-usual finale and how the storyline ultimately played out. That\u2019s largely because there was something refreshing about the fact that Tommy didn\u2019t get it right, that he was undone, that his ever-ticking mind began to falter. This hasn\u2019t been a perfect series (although I have personally enjoyed it) but one thing that has been beautifully handled has been Tommy\u2019s impending breakdown. The crisis has been coming since the opening episode and when it finally arrived, with Tommy genuinely unclear how he had lost and Mosley won, it rang absolutely true. That said, while I generally prefer the more talky episodes of Peaky and downbeat series endings, I\u2019m sure more than one viewer will have felt this conclusion set up more questions than it gave answers, as well as going round in circles (particularly where Arthur\u2019s story was concerned) just when it needed to build impetus the most. I did also wonder if Peaky Blinders increasingly needs more time to tell its story. Would another couple of episodes have allowed us to learn more about Gina or the Chinese, to spend more time with Polly and Aberama, to see a bit more of Jessie Eden or feel the gut-punch of poor Finn\u2019s mistake more clearly? Our heroes Oh Finn, didn\u2019t Arthur make it very clear that you should never tell your business to anyone outside the family, no matter how congenial they might seem? If you had the youngest and most inexperienced Shelby in the unintentional Fredo Corleone role, stick your hand up and I\u2019ll direct you to the now barman-less Garrison to collect your winnings. Not that things are looking much better for the rest of the family, after Michael drew power from Gina\u2019s brain cells to launch his bid for control of the family via the Chinese heroin trade with a wonderfully patronising speech about the new generation taking control and letting the old dogs head off to a \u2018legitimate\u2019 retirement. I admire Michael\u2019s impressive ability to convince himself he\u2019s so much smarter than he actually is, though in reality I suspect Gina\u2019s family will keep him around just as long as they need him and not a second more. I also wish he wasn\u2019t Polly\u2019s blind spot. While it makes sense that she chose son over nephew, it\u2019s more than a little depressing that she can\u2019t see Michael\u2019s thoughtless arrogance for what it is. The bad guys And so the great plot to kill Mosley fell apart at the seams. In truth it was never going to end any other way \u2013 and this is the problem with casting real-life figures as antagonists. While it might take the odd liberty, Peaky Blinders is not a show that messes with reality so there was no way Tommy\u2019s assassination could come off. Instead, the interest was always going to lie in just how it fell apart \u2013 and I did very much enjoy that, from Finn\u2019s slip to the murder of Barney and the ambushing of Aberama (alas poor Polly, ever unlucky in love). My favourite moment, however, came as Tommy, who has never looked so defeated or so small, stared out at his best laid plans falling apart only for Mosley to mutter: \u201cI think it\u2019s about time you got off the stage old man.\u201d Time is passing and the entire episode was focused on informing Tommy that he should exit stage left. But if we know anything about the middle Shelby brother it\u2019s that he hates being told what to do. I predict not a riot but a resurgence in series six. Old friends As I mentioned last week, if ever a man would have a taste for a spot of resurrection it\u2019s Alfie Solomons. And so it came to pass, as Tom Hardy popped by to inject a welcome note of hammy insanity into proceedings, while also providing Tommy with a vision of what his life might be like should he choose to quit the game. Did we need the scene with Alfie? Probably not, but it was a great deal of fun and I loved the little touches \u2013 from Alfie\u2019s doormat spelling out Lethe in honour of the river to the Greek underworld, to the fact that he spends his time shooting seagulls and would prefer not to hurt his dog by having it return to him. Notes from the boardroom \u2022 A sad goodbye to Aberama Gold, brutally murdered, and just as I was coming to truly appreciate you too. This wasn\u2019t the best of seasons for the Peaky women\u2019s lovers. \u2022 The conversation with Charlie might have been my favourite of the episode \u2013 if only because it confirmed my suspicions that he\u2019d always been in love with Tommy\u2019s mother. \u2022 His appearance may have been brief but I did enjoy Cosmo Jarvis\u2019s turn as poor, doomed Barney. \u2022 No Lizzy or Ada this week. I missed them both. \u2022 I don\u2019t know about you guys but I think old Grace is quite a malevolent shade \u2026 Anachronistic yet strangely right song of the week Nice use of Mercury-nominated Idles\u2019 Never Fight a Man with a Perm during Mosley\u2019s rally and I loved Richard Hawley\u2019s cover of Bob Dylan\u2019s Ballad of a Thin Man. But I have to give this to Anna Calvi, whose soundtrack has held the whole series together, providing a suitably spooky accompaniment to Tommy\u2019s breakdown. Quote of the week \u201cSince my resurrection I\u2019m considered to be a god in the Holy Land. Someone has made an image of me out of rock, embedded in the sand so I am told, and I am planning to make a pilgrimage to stand in my own shadow.\u201d It might be ludicrous to see him back from the dead but I still love the way Alfie tells them \u2026 Finally, thank you all for coming below the line, laying down theories, getting carried away, fed up and, at times, furious. Here\u2019s to a short wait till Peaky Blinders: series six. The drinks at the Garrison are on me, and one last time: no spoilers and all speculation welcome below \u2026",

And two of them were pleased to be watching from the couch.\u201d Saturday\u2019s preliminary final between Collingwood and the GWS Giants opened not with a bang, but with a whimper, writes Craig Little. But ultimately conspiracy theories, contentious calls and an improbable comeback all converged in the thrilling final act. Thinking time: Jonathan Van Ness on being HIV positive For Queer Eye\u2019s Jonathan Van Ness, Over the Top \u2013 his new biography \u2013 is about charting his own path through adolescence towards the triumph that is Queer Eye, but it\u2019s also about owning two of the most traumatic chapters in his life. The first occurred when he was four, when an older boy molested him in a closet. That single act of abuse casts a long, pernicious shadow over the book as we witness the ways in which Van Ness acts out his confusion and pain, from taking crystal meth, to sustained binges in sex clubs that satisfy his need to be wanted. He joins a 12-step program for sex addiction, but relapses. In the midst of all that, his stepfather, Steve, is diagnosed with bladder cancer, and told he has 11 months to live. Shortly after the funeral, his former boyfriend tracked him down at a bathhouse in St Louis and Van Ness\u2019s fall to rock bottom seems complete. Almost. When he gets sick, collapsing at the hair salon he is working at one afternoon, he already knows what a doctor will tell him a day later: he is HIV positive. \u201cIt occurred to me: what if everything I\u2019ve ever been through was preparing me for this moment \u2013 to be strong enough to share this, and to share it on my own terms,\u201d he says. \u201cPart of that for me is to process what\u2019s happened, but the bigger part is that I wanted to do something to move the conversation forward in a meaningful way around HIV/Aids, and what it is to live with HIV, and to humanise and normalise a lot of the things I talk about.\u201d He blinks, then adds, \u201cI\u2019m talking slow because I\u2019m trying not to cry.\u201d Media roundup Scott Morrison has publicly called on China to settle the trade war with the US, after meeting with Trump, the Australian reports. The Sydney Morning Herald reveals that \u201cMPs are charging taxpayers thousands of dollars for bound and \u2018personalised\u2019 editions of parliamentary speeches despite the content being available for free online\u201d. An ABC Four Corners investigation into the funeral industry has uncovered practices including identifying bodies in carparks. Coming up Scott Morrison and Donald Trump will visit the new billion-dollar paper factory in Ohio owned by Australia\u2019s Pratt Industries.

In return, the Democratic chair of the House intelligence committee said the president\u2019s reported conduct in the matter may make impeachment \u201cthe only remedy that is coequal to the evil\u201d. Donald Trump is reported to have pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate claims about Biden, the Democratic presidential frontrunner. On Saturday, Biden, who has denied all wrongdoing, accused Trump of an \u201coverwhelming abuse of power\u201d. On Sunday, leaving the White House for Texas and Ohio, Trump told reporters he was \u201cnot looking to hurt Biden, but he did a very dishonest thing\u201d.

The firing of Viktor Shokin was in fact an aim of the US, its allies, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. An investigation into the company for which Hunter Biden worked was dormant at the time of the vice-president\u2019s visit. In May 2019, Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general told Bloomberg, \u201cWe do not see any wrongdoing\u201d by the Bidens. In a disjointed interview with Fox News Sunday, Giuliani also tried to link the former vice-president to the billionaire philanthropist George Soros; to the production of a notorious dossier on Trump by Fusion GPS; and to \u201cthe $1.5bn that the Biden family took out of China while that guy was negotiating for us\u201d, all without offering evidence. \u201cThis will be a lot bigger than Spiro Agnew,\u201d Giuliani said, perhaps ill-advisedly referring to Richard Nixon\u2019s vice-president who resigned in 1973, amid the Watergate scandal that would bring down the president. Giuliani has admitted seeking to pressure Ukrainian authorities. The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that in a 25 July call with Zelenskiy, Trump asked eight times for the Bidens to be investigated. The call is reportedly the subject of an intelligence services whistleblower complaint which the White House is refusing to release to Congress. It has been suggested that Trump may have threatened to withhold military aid. About a month after the call, $250m in military assistance to a country fighting Russian-backed separatists was delayed. It was released this month, after the existence of the whistleblower complaint became public. Chris Murphy, a Democrat on the Senate foreign relations committee, told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on Sunday: \u201cThe timing is obviously incredibly suspicious.\u201d On Friday the Ukrainian foreign minister said the aid was not discussed in the July call, which he said was \u201clong and friendly\u201d. On Sunday Trump said the conversation was \u201cperfect\u201d and there was \u201cno quid pro quo\u201d. He has not denied asking Zelinskiy to investigate the Bidens. The former vice-president, who in Iowa on Saturday said \u201cTrump is using this because he knows I\u2019ll beat him like a drum\u201d, has called for the transcript to be released. So have allies of Trump. In Texas, the president suggested he might do so. It is not certain the call is the subject of the whistleblower complaint which, against legal precedent, acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire has refused to release. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chair of the House intelligence committee, told CNN\u2019s State of the Union: \u201cClearly [Trump] is afraid of the public seeing such things.\u201d Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNN and NBC showing the complaint to Congress \u201cwould be a terrible precedent\u201d, as conversations between world leaders should be confidential and not released after \u201cpolitical complaints\u201d. Mnuchin said he did not know what was said on the call between Trump and Zelinskiy. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo went further, telling ABC\u2019s This Week: \u201cI do think if Vice-President Biden behaved inappropriately, if he was protecting his son and intervened with the Ukrainian leadership in a way that was corrupt, I do think we need to get to the bottom of that.\u201d Schiff made unusually strong remarks about the prospects of Trump being impeached over Ukraine, as reports of his behaviour meant \u201cwe may have crossed the Rubicon\u201d. Of Giuliani, he said: \u201cBetraying your country \u2026 is one thing when it\u2019s done by the court jester, another thing when by the man who would be king.\u201d In a letter to Democratic lawmakers, House speaker Nancy Pelosi said failure to disclose the complaint to Congress would mark \u201ca grave new chapter of lawlessness\u201d and \u201ca whole new stage of investigation\u201d. House Democrats are already exploring impeachment over Trump\u2019s links to Russia and its interference in the 2016 election. Schiff cited Senate Republican opposition to impeachment as one reason still to go slow, and said his party needed public support. Russia, which annexed Crimea in 2014, backs separatists in the Donbass region of Ukraine. The Washington Post cited a former senior US official as saying Trump thought military aid to Ukraine \u201cwas pointless and just aggravating the Russians\u201d. \u201cThe president\u2019s position basically is, we should recognise the fact that the Russians should be our friends, and who cares about the Ukrainians?\u201d Trump and Zelinskiy are due to meet at the United Nations in New York next week.",

      "bodyText": "With a general election within touching distance, Labour\u2019s conference in Brighton was meant to be a showcase for its radical policies and an opportunity to enthuse grassroots members about the project of propelling Jeremy Corbyn into Downing Street. Instead, it kicked off on Friday evening with a botched bid to oust Tom Watson by abolishing his job and has continued with a battle over Brexit, pitching Corbyn and his trade union allies against thousands of grassroots members. Watson was eating a Chinese meal with his son in Manchester when he received the news that Jon Lansman had tabled a last-minute motion at the national executive committee (NEC), calling for the century-old post of deputy leader to be scrapped. It was only because the NEC chair, Wendy Nichols, ruled the motion out of order that the bid failed \u2013 because overturning her decision would have required a two-thirds majority. After a fearsome backlash overnight, Corbyn tabled a compromise motion at Saturday\u2019s NEC meeting in Brighton, calling instead for the position of deputy leader to be reviewed \u2013 a process he has suggested could result in another deputy being appointed. But in the intervening 12 hours or so, MPs\u2019 WhatsApp groups had buzzed with wild suggestions of challenging Corbyn for the leadership, breaking away en masse from Labour \u2013 and even following Chuka Umunna and Luciana Berger to the Lib Dems. One MP said: \u201cWe weren\u2019t far off something on Saturday. There could have been a split. It was nearly the final straw.\u201d In the bars and restaurants of the drizzle-drenched seaside town, shadow ministers speculated openly that Corbyn\u2019s key lieutenants were beginning to think about how the left could retain control of Labour should the party lose a general election, forcing him to step aside. A reinvigorated Watson arrived in Brighton to cheers from activists and gave a defiant speech at the conference rally of his Labour First grouping, calling for the party to support remaining in the EU. As the aftershocks of the botched coup continued to resound, the Sunday Times revealed details on Saturday evening of a memo Corbyn\u2019s policy chief, Andrew Fisher, sent earlier this week, as he told the Labour leader he wanted to step aside. Fisher is well liked, and he and Corbyn are very close, with some colleagues even comparing theirs to a father-son relationship. As the Labour leader faced questions from Andrew Marr about Fisher\u2019s remarks regarding the \u201cblizzard of lies\u201d emanating from Corbyn\u2019s office, his aide, Seumas Milne, sat alongside Fisher in the green room.

      "bodyText": "The disgraced TV host Charlie Rose used his eponymous PBS interview show as \u201can instrument of his predatory sexual behavior\u201d, turning his studio into a \u201csexual hunting ground\u201d, his longtime makeup artist has alleged in a new lawsuit. Rose, now 77, saw his PBS show cancelled in November 2017 after misconduct allegations emerged. A high-profile casualty of the first phase of the #MeToo era, in which a number of famous men faced accusations of sexual misconduct and assault, he was also fired by CBS News. Responding to the new lawsuit, which was filed in Manhattan state court, Rose\u2019s attorney said he denied allegations that \u201cmakes a good tabloid story, but not much else\u201d. Gina Riggi managed makeup for the Charlie Rose show for 22 years. She claims to have endured \u201cmisogynistic, abusive behavior \u2026 demeaning, embarrassing and degrading her because of her gender, ridiculing her physical appearance and physically accosting her on the set, forcing her to use a hand mirror to protect herself from him\u201d. Rose is also alleged to have \u201ccreated a toxic work environment suffused with sexual harassment and gender-based abuse for \u2026 female staff, using the show as an instrument of his predatory sexual behavior, and the Bloomberg studio where he recorded it as a sexual hunting ground\u201d. Rose is alleged to have preyed on women at his Manhattan and Hamptons homes, as well as \u201ctrendy restaurants where he insisted on hosting staff events\u201d. \u201cMr Rose routinely groped and pawed at his female staff, pressed himself against them, hugged them, kissed them, pulled them toward him, whispered in their ears, stared at their breasts, looked down their shirts and otherwise subjected them to inappropriate and unwanted physical contact,\u201d continues the suit, which was filed on 19 September. Riggi also says she once heard a female producer \u201cmake reference to \u2018the crusty claw\u2019, a reference to Mr Rose\u2019s propensity to grab female staff inappropriately\u201d. In a statement to the Guardian, Rose\u2019s lawyer, Jonathan Bach, said his client \u201cvehemently denies and will vigorously contest these allegations\u201d. Riggi\u2019s allegations, Bach said, are \u201ccompletely inconsistent with written statements made by the plaintiff to Mr Rose, including \u2018I love working for you at your show, and would love to be part of any show that you host\u2019, \u2018I consider it an honor to be a member of your team\u2019 and \u2018Hope to see you more often!

It was completely normal for someone who had written the highly regarded 2017 manifesto to announce his resignation when it might be only months before another election. And Brexit was just about sorted. He\u2019d negotiate a new deal with the EU and then have another referendum in which he might or might not support one side or the other. It all depended on what the members decided but he was sure the conference agenda could be stitched up in advance. Anything to keep people guessing. A sense of solidarity was also markedly lacking in a lunchtime fringe meeting where the Unite leader, Len McCluskey, was insisting that Labour was a party of unity and healing. It was just that some of the healing meant eliminating anyone with a different opinion to him. Cruel to be kind. Extreme unction. Any Labour frontbencher who didn\u2019t agree with whatever he happened to believe on any given day would have to be sacked. In which case there were plenty of volunteers on view. Watson had emerged positively chipper from his near-death experience \u2013 it\u2019s come to something when old Labour bods can\u2019t organise a decent purge \u2013 and had been welcomed with loud cheers at another fringe meeting where he had once again contradicted the moving target of Labour\u2019s Brexit policy. As had Emily Thornberry. And Clive Lewis. At a time when Labour is committed to stamping out the gig economy, it\u2019s curious to find so many of its MPs choosing to go freelance.",

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn is on a collision course with Labour\u2019s membership after he attempted to stop the party campaigning to remain in the EU at a general election. Before a crucial vote on Monday on whether the party should explicitly back remain in any election, Labour\u2019s autumn conference descended into factional rows over its Brexit policy, with rebellious MPs privately threatening another leadership challenge. Corbyn moved to stamp his authority on Labour\u2019s Brexit position by proposing a delay to deciding how the party should campaign at a second referendum. His proposal to put off the decision until after an election was endorsed by the national executive committee, by 16 votes to 10, after members were asked to send their agreement by email and without a meeting. \u201cThe NEC believes it is right that the party shall only decide how to campaign in such a referendum \u2013 through a one-day special conference, following the election of a Labour government,\u201d the statement said. However, pro-EU activists fought during a lengthy meeting on Sunday night to ensure there would be a vote on the conference floor on Monday on whether Labour should immediately adopt an unequivocally remain position. More than 50 local parties swung behind a pro-remain motion, while eight backed a more neutral motion closer to the leadership\u2019s position. Both options will now be voted on by delegates, along with the official national executive position, leaving open the possibility that competing motions could pass and cause further confusion over the party\u2019s Brexit policy. The pro-remain motion reads: \u201cLabour must reflect the overwhelming view of its members and votes, who want to stay in the EU.

However, party activists at the \u201ccompositing\u201d meeting on Sunday night showed their appetite for defying the leadership over the issue of Brexit, with the aim of forcing a remain stance into the next election manifesto. Corbyn explained he was in favour of negotiating a Labour Brexit deal before letting the party decide how it would campaign in a second referendum in an interview on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show. When asked if it was in Britain\u2019s long-term interests to remain in the EU, the Labour leader suggested a Labour Brexit deal could be preferable in some circumstances: \u201cIt depends on the agreement you have with the European Union outside.\u201d The new position caused a fresh revolt among several shadow ministers and pro-remain activists, adding to the febrile mood at the Brighton conference following an abortive attempt by Jon Lansman, the Momentum chair, to abolish Tom Watson\u2019s job as deputy leader and the resignation of Corbyn\u2019s key policy aide, Andrew Fisher. Clive Lewis, a shadow Treasury minister and supporter of Corbyn, said the leadership had been \u201chijacked\u201d and was taking power away from members. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, also made clear her unhappiness with the position, saying Labour risked getting stuck in a \u201ccrusher\u201d between leave and remain with the \u201cwalls coming in\u201d unless it picks a side before an election. She said a new direction in favour of remain needed to be decided by activists at this conference, not in a future one after an election. Another shadow cabinet minister involved in election campaign planning told the Guardian that his position has changed and he now believes Labour needs to campaign to remain, because of the risk of voters moving to a revitalised Lib Dem party. Many of Corbyn\u2019s allies on the left also believe the party needs to take pick a side on Brexit before the election. Laura Parker, Momentum\u2019s national coordinator, said Corbyn must decide on Labour\u2019s Brexit this week, not after a general election. \u201cWe have to decide at this conference. The one we have come to, the one we have travelled across the country to come to, not at some putative further conference which is presumably in the mythical land with that fucking table with all our options on it,\u201d she said. The issue has been causing serious tensions within Corbyn\u2019s own team. It is understood Fisher, who resigned citing a lack of \u201cprofessionalism, competence and human decency\u201d in the Labour leader\u2019s team, has been arguing that the party\u2019s policy of trying to appeal to both sides over Brexit was no longer working and was electorally problematic. He tweeted several supportive policy statements on Sunday, indicating he was still backing Corbyn\u2019s project overall and sources confirmed he would stay on to write the manifesto at the next election. Ahead of Monday\u2019s debate, pro-remain activists were increasingly hopeful that their motion would pass, potentially with the help of some trade unions. The collective union position is the same as Corbyn\u2019s stance, but senior union sources said Unison was considering breaking ranks. Michael Chessum, of Another Europe is Possible, said his group had been \u201cutterly determined\u201d to take a remain position to conference floor and urged delegates not to see it as a test of loyalty to Corbyn. \u201cThere will be an attempt to turn this into a loyalty test. But those proposing these motions are by and large people, like me, who have spent years fighting for the left inside Labour and backing Corbyn,\u201d he said. However, Len McCluskey, the general secretary of Unite, said it would be a \u201cloyalty test\u201d as he said any shadow cabinet ministers openly advocating a pro-remain position should get behind the leadership or \u201cstep aside\u201d. The second day of conference was dominated by the row over Brexit, but many anti-Corbyn MPs were also exercised by the move earlier in the week to abolish Watson\u2019s post as deputy leader. This was abandoned on Saturday after an intervention from Corbyn, but MPs on the centrist wing of the party were up in arms about the move against him. Several suggested on their WhatsApp group that Watson should challenge Corbyn for the leadership or lead a public split of Labour MPs, regardless of the country potentially being very close to a general election. Watson is understood to have dismissed the idea that this was time for a breakaway but the deputy leader arrived at the party\u2019s conference earlier than expected in order to fight any further attempts on his position. Two shadow cabinet ministers told the Guardian they believed the bid to oust Watson was related to concerns within the Labour leadership about Corbyn\u2019s position if he were to lose an election and stand down, with the deputy leader potentially becoming the most powerful elected person in the party. Watson was among those on the NEC who declined to support the statement on Brexit, which is also expected to be put to a vote on the conference floor. Watson said: \u201cI have no doubt that Jeremy\u2019s supporters on the NEC will endorse any statement he proposes. However, without the NEC having met to debate over it, we risk giving an imperfect document to conference, and the document not being given the weight it deserves by delegates.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "If fashion is a reflection of the times it is little wonder that the current round of shows have often felt discombobulating. Gucci\u2019s show on Sunday night was particularly surreal, opening with a series of models being propelled along a conveyor belt catwalk, staring bleakly ahead, wearing a high fashion take on straitjackets. However, in a protest that a press officer confirmed was not planned, one of the models held up their hands on which the words \u201cmental health is not fashion\u201d had been written. The model, Ayesha Tan Jones, later posted a video from the show on their Instagram feed: The video was accompanied by a statement that read: \u201cAs an artist and model who has experienced my own struggles with mental health, as well as family members and loved ones who have been affected by depression, anxiety, bipolar and schizophrenia, is hurtful and insensitive for a major fashion house such as Gucci to use this imagery as a concept for a fleeting fashion moment.\u201d It added: \u201cIt is in bad taste for Gucci to use the imagery of strait jackets and outfits alluding to mental patients, while being rolled out on a conveyor belt as if a piece of factory meat. \u201cPresenting these struggles as props for selling clothes in today\u2019s capitalist climate is vulgar, unimaginative and offensive to the millions of people around the world affected by these issues.\u201d Some attendees, such as the actor and model Hari Nef, defended the show\u2019s concept.

The US and Gulf states have blamed Iran for the incidents including the alleged use of explosives against four oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman in May, suspicious fires on two tankers in the same area in June and the attempted seizure of the British vessel in July, allegedly by Iranian boats that were driven off by a Royal Navy warship. A Gibraltar court ordered the release of the Iranian vessel, then called Grace and since renamed Adrian Darya 1, on 18 August after receiving written assurances from Iran that it would not head to countries under EU sanctions. Tehran denies making any such assurances and the UK says the Adrian Darya 1, which turned off its transponder off the Syrian coast earlier this month, has sold its oil to Assad\u2019s regime.

And with all due apologies. Here it comes, the radioactive cloud currently coating the Premier League in its toxic lustre, that tinge of sporting death that is ill-conceived, badly applied VAR. Every system needs time to find its rhythms.</p> \n<p>This is complex, fast-evolving stuff, enacted on the hoof, and in a sport that excites furious, unceasing disagreement like no other human activity.

For the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/21/leicester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">second time in two days</a> a pivotal Premier League goal was ruled out by another of those problematic reviews.

They must come with an instant recovery time, a professionalism that means no more punching the air, no more touchline sprints, no more unalloyed joy. Like the sound of that?

VAR said otherwise. Mason Mount\u2019s toe was decreed to have been offside in the build-up, his ankle having strayed across a line drawn by the VAR as Willian passed the ball down the left flank.</p> \n<p>Stop. Rewind. Delete. Swallow all that emotion. And within two minutes Liverpool were 2-0 up though Firmino, another superbly worked goal (and some slack marking) that the post-VAR lull should not diminish.

Two days, two interventions, two problems.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It seems fairly obvious that Serge Aurier\u2019s goal at Leicester on Saturday should have stood. The technology is not good enough to decree with absolute certainty whether Son Heung-min\u2019s armpit was two millimetres offside at the precise moment (whenever that was) the ball was passed, as captured between frames by an elevated TV camera.</p> \n<p>Drawing a best-guess straight line is not accuracy, consistency, or whatever it is we expect. There is only a pretence of academic rigour here. Understanding and acknowledging a margin for error, incorporating uncertainty is a part of being precise. This is simply bad science.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/sep/23/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action\">Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend\u2019s action</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Fast forward 24 hours and Mount\u2019s foot was, arguably, slightly more offside than Son\u2019s armpit. But only arguably, and based on a line that there is no evidence we can actually trust. A middle-aged man playing with a light pen is not the Large Hadron Collider.</p> \n<p>Plus, of course, what is offside actually for? Firstly to stop the game from losing its shape, dissolving into a cross between Aussie Rules and mass goal-hanging. And secondly, in its finer margins, to stop players cheating by pushing this enforced line and gaining an advantage.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6bc58f08-e7e6-4e84-a679-60eeecde0a0d\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fFUo4uW6nGQ?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In this case there was no advantage to Mount in having a toe, arguably, beyond the line of a player 20 yards away. It didn\u2019t cause the game to lose its shape. It was offside because a man with a pen drew a pointlessly certain line.</p> \n<p>Most people have by now \u201cbacked a horse\u201d in this race and are intent on arguing it to the line either way. The idea of being pro or anti VAR has its ideological, even generational edge. Suggest this isn\u2019t currently working and you risk becoming a Proper Football Man crying into his Charles Hughes coaching manual about the death of My Day When Things Were Good.</p> \n<p>And yes, there is a paradox to complaining about discussion of VAR, on a page that discusses VAR at great (and no doubt) tedious length. But the sport is unavoidably affected by all this. There is a price to pay here for the most precious part of the spectacle, the miracle of the moment, the goal, the shared experience. Is it worth paying? </p>",

Liverpool were deserved winners at Stamford Bridge, with another display of fine, optimistic attacking football. At the same time Chelsea might also have taken a point. Sad to say this fine, slightly chancy line was decided by something else besides these moments of skill; tipped one way, albeit not decided, by another key intervention from football\u2019s own flawed deus ex machina. Yes: it\u2019s VAR! And with all due apologies. Here it comes, the radioactive cloud currently coating the Premier League in its toxic lustre, that tinge of sporting death that is ill-conceived, badly applied VAR. Every system needs time to find its rhythms. This is complex, fast-evolving stuff, enacted on the hoof, and in a sport that excites furious, unceasing disagreement like no other human activity. But there is a problem here with refinement and with the limits of the technology. For the second time in two days a pivotal Premier League goal was ruled out by another of those problematic reviews. It is something that needs to be fixed. Once again this came with the double-jeopardy punishment of a goal conceded at the other end while the crowd, the players and the manager still seemed to be absorbing the gut punch of all that short-lived elation. This is an issue for players and coaches to resolve and work on: goal celebrations must now be guarded. They must come with an instant recovery time, a professionalism that means no more punching the air, no more touchline sprints, no more unalloyed joy. Like the sound of that? Well, it\u2019s coming. Here\u2019s how it happened. Liverpool had begun like a train at a muggy, clammy Stamford Bridge. The opening goal was a moment of jaw-drop, Alexander-Arnold running on to Mo Salah\u2019s backheel and producing that sublime finish. Chelsea pressed back and thought they had equalised on 27 minutes, C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta tapping home after a scramble in the goalmouth. VAR said otherwise. Mason Mount\u2019s toe was decreed to have been offside in the build-up, his ankle having strayed across a line drawn by the VAR as Willian passed the ball down the left flank. Stop. Rewind. Delete. Swallow all that emotion. And within two minutes Liverpool were 2-0 up though Firmino, another superbly worked goal (and some slack marking) that the post-VAR lull should not diminish. But still. Two days, two interventions, two problems. It seems fairly obvious that Serge Aurier\u2019s goal at Leicester on Saturday should have stood. The technology is not good enough to decree with absolute certainty whether Son Heung-min\u2019s armpit was two millimetres offside at the precise moment (whenever that was) the ball was passed, as captured between frames by an elevated TV camera. Drawing a best-guess straight line is not accuracy, consistency, or whatever it is we expect. There is only a pretence of academic rigour here. Understanding and acknowledging a margin for error, incorporating uncertainty is a part of being precise. This is simply bad science. Fast forward 24 hours and Mount\u2019s foot was, arguably, slightly more offside than Son\u2019s armpit. But only arguably, and based on a line that there is no evidence we can actually trust. A middle-aged man playing with a light pen is not the Large Hadron Collider. Plus, of course, what is offside actually for? Firstly to stop the game from losing its shape, dissolving into a cross between Aussie Rules and mass goal-hanging. And secondly, in its finer margins, to stop players cheating by pushing this enforced line and gaining an advantage. In this case there was no advantage to Mount in having a toe, arguably, beyond the line of a player 20 yards away. It didn\u2019t cause the game to lose its shape. It was offside because a man with a pen drew a pointlessly certain line. Most people have by now \u201cbacked a horse\u201d in this race and are intent on arguing it to the line either way. The idea of being pro or anti VAR has its ideological, even generational edge. Suggest this isn\u2019t currently working and you risk becoming a Proper Football Man crying into his Charles Hughes coaching manual about the death of My Day When Things Were Good. And yes, there is a paradox to complaining about discussion of VAR, on a page that discusses VAR at great (and no doubt) tedious length. But the sport is unavoidably affected by all this. There is a price to pay here for the most precious part of the spectacle, the miracle of the moment, the goal, the shared experience. Is it worth paying?",

Perhaps the most notable absence was that of Joe Biden, the former vice-president who Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement Action, the forum organiser, declined to invite after his campaign failed to respond to a questionnaire. Biden, a centrist in a field increasingly dominated by progressive ideas, has dropped behind Warren in the polls in Iowa for the first time. To a number of speakers at the forum, his absence spoke volumes. The Minnesota congresswoman Ilhan Omar, one of four new members of the House of Representatives racially abused by Donald Trump, gave the keynote speech. She demanded \u201ca president who realises we are not just fighting for one election, we are fighting for the very soul of our democracy and what society we want to become\u201d. Asked by the Guardian if Biden could be that candidate, Omar was less than optimistic. \u201cThere are few people who fit into the kind of progress that we all want to see in this country,\u201d Omar said. \u201cAnd I would say he is not one of them. \u201cI think it has been very clear to many of the people who have been creating the kind of movement that is exciting generations, that we want somebody who really has a plan that is going to tackle a lot of the systematic challenges that we have, and he doesn\u2019t.\u201d Asked about Biden\u2019s absence, former housing secretary and presidential hopeful Juli\u00e1n Castro told the Guardian: \u201cI\u2019ll just say that if we\u2019re going to win this election in 2020, it\u2019s going to be because we excite people, and we can\u2019t excite them if we don\u2019t show up for them.\u201d Like the other candidates who attended, Castro was pushed by questioners from Iowa and other midwestern states on subjects including Medicare for All, immigration reform and the creation of a \u201cHomes Guarantee\u201d \u2013 an initiative that would create 12m new housing units supported by federal rent control to combat a growing housing crisis. Tiana Caldwell, an organiser with Kansas City Tenants in Action, told Castro she was evicted from her home last year and forced into housing with overflowing sewage, which she was also forced to leave, meaning she was homeless for six months. \u201cWhy are we forced to live like this in the wealthiest country in history?\u201d she asked. \u201cI can\u2019t take it anymore. I need a homes guarantee.\u201d Castro accepted there were differences between his affordable housing plan to create 3m new homes and the \u201cHomes Guarantee\u201d. He told the audience of around 2,000: \u201cI don\u2019t want to sugar coat that, but I believe that mine is the most ambitious plan that any candidate has put forward.\u201d Warren was also pushed on the Homes Guarantee but declined to endorse it, pushing her plan to invest $500bn over the next decade in affordable housing. Of the four candidates who appeared, only Sanders has endorsed a plan for federal rent control. The senator from Vermont invited the Guardian to observe an intimate meeting with a group of workers from the Fight for $15 group. Kelly Osborne, a McDonald\u2019s worker from Cedar Rapids, told him how her hours had been cut, making a small pay rise from $8.25 to $10 an hour essentially irrelevant. As he listened, Sanders\u2019 smile disappeared. The senator, a longtime backer of the fight for a $15 minimum wage, first met the 44-year-old earlier this year, as he took part in a strike with other fast food workers. He appeared disgusted. \u201cJesus Christ,\u201d he muttered under his breath. \u201cI\u2019m not making any more money than I was before,\u201d Osborne said, \u201cand I\u2019m working just as hard.\u201d Sanders replied: \u201cThere is no end to the greed. Every time you think you hear a new low, then it gets lower.\u201d No candidate was as warmly received as Sanders, who was given standing ovations as he answered questions from community leaders. Among a progressive audience there was little evidence that he was slipping, as the most recent polls suggest. The South Bend, Indiana, mayor, Pete Buttigieg, drew perhaps the most lukewarm response. As he responded to a question about Medicare expansion, which he supports while advocating for a private insurance option, he met with chants of \u201cMedicare for All\u201d. Organisers intervened to quieten the crowd. The questioner, Sameena Mustafa of Seniors in Action in Chicago, asked a follow-up. \u201cA market-driven approach has meant that 40,000 people die a year without healthcare, that a $6 vile of insulin is being sold for $300,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know as president you will be commander-in-chief. Will you be the healer-in-chief?\u201d \u201cYou can count on it,\u201d Buttigieg said. Mustafa did not seem convinced.",

But the broader story is clear, and quite interesting; members are complaining that they are not having as much influence over policy as they want.</p> <p>In their recent book on party political membership, <a href=\"https://www.routledge.com/Footsoldiers-Political-Party-Membership-in-the-21st-Century-1st-Edition/Bale-Webb-Poletti/p/book/9781138302464\">Footsoldiers</a>, the academics <strong>Tim Bale, Paul Webb </strong>and<strong> Monica Poletti</strong> reveal that in 2017 Labour members were more likely than members of any other main party (the Tories, the Lib Dems, the SNP, Greens and Ukip) to say that they should have more influence over party policy. At one level this was surprising because Tory members have almost zero influence over party policy, and Labour members have some influence. But the kind of people who join Labour expect to have a say over party policy, and when Jeremy Corbyn was elected leader he promised to give more power to the membership. Bale, Webb and Poletti write:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The figures for the 2017 survey suggest, however, that [Corbyn] was not widely felt to have delivered on this promise during his first two years as leader - an impression only strengthened by subsequent developments: by 2019, there were unmistakeable signs of growing discontent among an overwhelmingly anti-Brexit membership of the way Jeremy Corbyn was dealing with this issue.</p> </blockquote> <p>This analysis does not take account the fact that this year the conference schedule has been changed to ensure that members do have more of a say in the past. As<strong> Luke Akehurst</strong> explains <a href=\"https://labourlist.org/2019/09/what-to-expect-from-labour-conference-2019/\">in this LabourList briefing</a>, this year 20 priority ballot motions are being debated, not the usual four.

In her speech, <strong>Angela Rayner</strong>, the shadow education secretary, said a Labour government would be committed to the \u201cintegration\u201d of private schools into the state sector. She told delegates:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>That is why we\u2019ll upgrade social mobility to social justice, turning the Social Mobility Commission into the Social Justice Commission. And we will set that commission to work on making the whole education system fairer through the integration of private schools.</p> <p>John McDonnell and I will set out the further steps a Labour government would take. But I can say today that our very first budget will immediately close the tax loopholes used by elite private schools, and use that money to improve the lives of all children.</p> </blockquote> <p>Quite what this pledge means in practice is not clear. As Rayner says, Labour wants to take away the tax advantages private schools enjoy, which would make private education more expensive, and perhaps as a result less desirable. But delegates want Labour to go further.</p> <p>The conference is currently debating two composite motions on schools. One of them \u2013 schools composite 1, moved by Battersea CLP \u2013 says \u201cthe ongoing existence of private schools is incompatible with Labour\u2019s pledge to promote social justice, not social mobility in education\u201d. It goes on:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Conference resolves:</p> <p>To include in the next Labour party general election manifesto a commitment to integrate all private schools into the state sector. That would include, but is not limited to:</p> <p>Withdrawal of charitable status and all other public subsidies and tax privileges including business rate exemption.</p> <p>Ensure universities admit the same proportion of private school pupils as in the wider population (currently 7%).</p> <p>Endowments, investments and properties held by private schools to be redistributed democratically and fairly across the country\u2019s educational institutions.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"56418af84376d9a31dc3a719d15d481f1b70dadc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56418af84376d9a31dc3a719d15d481f1b70dadc/0_13_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Angela Rayner.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Angela Rayner.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anthony Harvey/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-22T17:25:42.455Z\">at 6.25pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d8738da8f08f30dc5bc00ec\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-22T09:59:39.060Z\">10.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Jeremy Corbyn's interview with Andrew Marr \u2013 summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are the main points from Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s interview with Andrew Marr.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Corbyn said the UK could be better off outside the EU than within if the right Brexit deal were available.</strong> (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/22/labour-conference-latest-news-jeremy-corbyn-calls-for-party-to-have-two-deputy-leaders-live-news?page=with:block-5d8735ce8f0834740f3bfebb#block-5d8735ce8f0834740f3bfebb\">10am.)</a> While recognising that most party members wanted the UK to remain in the EU, Corbyn said it was important to recognise why 17 million people voted to leave. He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Please remember why people voted leave, why people voted remain, but also remember there is more that unites all of those people \u2013 over austerity, over investment, over education, over housing, over health, over a green industrial revolution \u2013 than there is that divides them.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said that if the conference voted for Labour to campaign for remain in all circumstances, he would respect that decision. </strong>At the moment his policy is for Labour to offer voters a choice between remain and a credible leave option in a referendum after the election, and for the party to decide its stance at the time. But, when asked if he would agree to campaign for remain regardless if the conference voted for that this week (Brexit is being debated tomorrow), Corbyn replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I will go along with whatever decision the party comes to.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He did not rule out giving Labour MPs a free vote if Boris Johnson brings a deal back to the Commons. </strong>However, he implied this was unlikely. Asked if a free vote was possible, he replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I would hope we could vote together as a party on this. And that is what I\u2019ve tried to do all the way through.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said Labour and other opposition parties would use Commons votes to block a further suspension of parliament if the supreme court ruled that the current suspension (prorogation) was unlawful.</strong> The court is due to announce its ruling early next week, and Corbyn said there should be an immediate recall of parliament in those circumstances. And he said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If [the supreme court] decide that parliament should be recalled \u2026 then we would seek to take immediate action in parliament to prevent him closing down parliament all the way through to 31 October. So I would work with the other opposition parties, as we have up to now.</p> </blockquote> <p>Corbyn did not say how opposition parties might stop a second prorogation. It is normally just up to the prime minister to decide when parliament is prorogued.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Corbyn said he did not know that his ally Jon Lansman was going to call a vote at Labour\u2019s national executive committee meeting on Friday calling for the post of deputy leader to be abolished.</strong> He said he was aware of general talk about changing the role, but not that this motion was going to be proposed. He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I was not aware that the particular motion was going to be moved at that time, but I knew there were people discussing options.</p> </blockquote> <p>Corbyn also claimed the move was not directed against Watson personally. When it was put to him that he should have known what was being planned, he replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m not all-seeing and all-knowing \u2013 I\u2019d love to be.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Corbyn dismisses concerns about the operation of his office raised by his policy adviser Andrew Fisher <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/21/remain-mps-accuse-jeremy-corbyn-shutting-down-brexit-debate\">in a private memo about his decision to resign.</a></strong> When asked why the memo referred to colleagues having a \u201clack of human decency\u201d and a issuing a \u201cblizzard of lies\u201d, Corbyn confirmed that he had read the document. He went on:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think [Fisher] said that because he was extremely distressed at that point about whatever was going on in discussions within the office at that moment. I would have thought similar memos fly around the BBC pretty much every day.</p> </blockquote> <p>Corbyn also stressed that Fisher would stay in his job until the end of the year and said he had had a \u201cvery convivial\u201d coffee with Fisher and other members of his team only this morning. He went on:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>He is a great colleague, a great friend \u2026 I\u2019ve worked with Andrew for 15 years, when I was a backbencher and many other times. He is a great writer, he\u2019s a great thinker and he\u2019s done a huge amount of work in the party. We get along absolutely very well and he\u2019s promised that whatever happens in the future he will be working with me on policy issues.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Corbyn rejected suggestions that he might be about to step down. </strong>He said he would lead the party into the general election and serve a full term as PM if he won. (There were claims that the move to oust Tom Watson was prompted by fears that Corbyn might be close to resigning, which would raise the prospect of Watson taking over as interim leader.)</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Corbyn defended Labour\u2019s decision, announced today, to commit to abolishing Ofsted.</strong> Asked why he was doing this, Corbyn replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Because it is a very assertive form of investigation into a school. They turn up every few years, or sometimes more frequently than that, and do an exercise on that school and then make a decision about it. The level of stress on the students and the teachers is absolutely enormous. </p> <p>What we want instead is a more frequent form of supportive investigation of schools and examination of them through HMI, Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectors of schools, but also through local authorities. It\u2019s part of reinvigorating local education authorities to administer all schools within that community area.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said that if he became PM he would try to fly less than his predecessors and use trains more.</strong> \u201cI fly as little as I can now,\u201d he said. \u201cI take trains wherever I can.\u201d Promising to do the same in government, he said \u201can example has to be set\u201d.</li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"27467e4007b9c86fc62026124addabce055c774b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/27467e4007b9c86fc62026124addabce055c774b/0_100_3000_1802/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn (right) on the the Andrew Marr Show.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Corbyn (right) on the the Andrew Marr Show.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout/BBC via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-22T10:14:36.997Z\">at 11.14am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d8735ce8f0834740f3bfebb\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-22T09:00:16.793Z\">10.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Corbyn says UK could be better off outside EU if right deal available</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is the full exchange with <strong>Andrew Marr </strong>where <strong>Jeremy Corbyn</strong> said the UK could be better off outside the EU than inside in some circumstances.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>AM:</strong> One of your first jobs [as PM] is go to Brussels and negotiate a new Brexit deal \u2026 In that context, is it your view that Britain is better off inside the European Union or better off, long-term, outside the European Union?

On Friday night there was the surprise attempt to abolish the post of deputy leader. By lunchtime yesterday the plot had been abandoned, but it was a stark reminder of how deep divisions are in the party, partly over Brexit but also over Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership. The row has distracted attention from the fact that this is also a policy-rich conference, with Labour announcing a cache of policies likely to feature in the forthcoming general election.</p> <p>Here are the main stories around this morning.</p> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/21/labour-plunges-into-brexit-chaos\">Jeremy Corbyn was struggling to contain an open revolt by some of his most senior shadow ministers, MPs and party activists last night as anger over his refusal to back a policy of remaining in the EU threatened to wreck the Labour conference.</a></strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Corbyn has <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/jeremy-corbyn-calls-two-deputy-20139862\">told the Sunday Mirror</a> that he would like Labour to have two deputy leaders.</strong> Referring to the failed attempt to abolish Tom Watson\u2019s post, and the way he defused it at a meeting of Labour\u2019s national executive committee yesterday, Corbyn said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I told the national executive we need to review how the deputy leadership works and have an election process for two deputy leaders in the future which reflects diversity within our society so one would be a woman. It was agreed overwhelmingly.</p> </blockquote> <p>Last year Labour was expected to vote to create a second deputy leader\u2019s post but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2018/sep/25/labour-conference-brexit-debate-starmer-increasingly-likely-to-vote-down-mays-brexit-deal-starmer-says-politics-live?page=with:block-5baa2770e4b0a9b9706792e0#block-5baa2770e4b0a9b9706792e0\">the plan was unexpectedly shelved at the last minute</a> \u2013 reportedly because the leadership feared that the election for the second deputy leader would turn into a proxy ballot on Corbyn\u2019s Brexit policy, with members electing a candidate strongly backing a second referendum (which at the time Corbyn was resisting).</p> <ul> <li><strong>Corbyn has played down his differences with Watson, <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/jeremy-corbyn-calls-two-deputy-20139862\">telling the Sunday Mirror</a> that disagreements on policy are inevitable in a shadow cabinet. </strong>Corbyn said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019ve got a shadow cabinet with great energy. <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/diane-abbott\">Diane Abbott</a> says she disagrees with me three times a day but totally supports my leadership. When you have people who are very politically committed there are bound to be debates.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/21/remain-mps-accuse-jeremy-corbyn-shutting-down-brexit-debate\">Andrew Fisher, a key adviser to Jeremy Corbyn, has reportedly quit saying the Labour leader cannot win the next general election.</a></strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/21/labour-we-will-scrap-ofsted-radical-election-pledge\">Labour is pledging to abolish Ofsted and end \u201chigh stakes\u201d school inspections as part of radical plans drawn up before a possible snap election.</a> </strong>There are more details of the party\u2019s plans <a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/press/labour-scrap-unfit-purpose-ofsted-overhaul-school-inspection-regime/\">here</a>.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/press/labour-announces-plans-scrap-prescription-charges/\">Labour is promising to abolish prescription charges in England.</a></strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/press/labour-announces-plans-reduce-number-victims-crime-scrapping-ineffective-short-sentences-investing-proven-alternatives-custody/\">Labour is announcing plans to abolish ineffective short prison sentences.</a> </strong>The shadow justice secretary, <strong>Richard Burgon</strong>, said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Sending people to prison for a few weeks is often the worst way to tackle the drug addictions, mental health and debt problems that lead to people to commit certain crimes in the first place. The Ministry of Justice\u2019s own evidence shows there would be tens of thousands fewer crimes if ineffective short prison sentences were scrapped. </p> <p>For some offenders \u2013 including those who have committed rape, murder and other violent or sexual offences \u2013 prison will always be necessary. But jailing others for a few weeks in a prison system in crisis reduces the chances of rehabilitation, making reoffending more likely.

The paper says Arcuri was given \u00a3126,000 in public money and was afforded privileged access to three foreign trade missions Johnson led. <strong>Jon Trickett</strong>, Labour\u2019s shadow Cabinet Office minister, said Johnson should provide full disclosure on the allegations. Trickett said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Boris Johnson must now give a full account of his actions in response to these grave and most serious allegations of the misuse use of public money in his former role as mayor of London.</p> <p>The public has a right to know how and why these funds were used for the benefit of a close personal friend without on the face of it legitimate reason. </p> <p>This cannot be swept under the carpet.

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn is facing a clash with party members tomorrow over his plan to postpone a vote on what stance the party should adopt in a referendum on Brexit until after the general election. The party\u2019s national executive committee has approved a motion saying this decision must \u201conly\u201d be taken after the proposed Brexit renegotiation. See 4.40pm. But surveys suggest the Labour membership is overwhelming in favour of remain, and at least 80 motions have been submitted saying the party should commit to remain now. Delegates will debate this decision tomorrow afternoon, but whether the conference ends up taking a firm decision, or settling on a compromise, may depend on the wording of the composite motion that is being drafted in a private meeting this evening. Delegates have voted for a motion that theoretically commits the party to getting rid of private schools. (See 6.25pm.) Other motions passed by the conference, under new procedures intended to give delegates more say over policy (see 5.52pm), include ending NHS outsourcing and making the provision of all social care free. (See 7.02pm.) Jeremy Corbyn has suggested a Labour Brexit deal could be preferable to remaining in the EU, putting himself on a collision course with activists and MPs pushing for the party to campaign for remain. Diane Abbott has urged a key adviser to Jeremy Corbyn who resigned citing a lack of \u201cprofessionalism, competence and human decency\u201d in the Labour leader\u2019s team to reconsider his decision. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. Thanks for the comments. From the Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar This is from my colleague Rajeev Syal. @labourlewis is Clive Lewis. As promised a bit earlier, here is a summary of the five composite motions and one women\u2019s conference motion passed by delegates earlier. (See 5.15pm.) All were passed overwhelmingly on a show of hands. 1) Schools composite 1 This effectively commits the party to abolishing private schools. See 6.25pm. 2) Schools composite 2 This says Labour should stop the opening of any new academies and free schools and bring all publicly funded schools back under the control of local authority education committees. 3) NHS composite 1 This says Labour should provide \u201cthe necessary additional resources to cover rising costs in the NHS and social care\u201d and \u201cend all privatisation and outsourcing in the NHS\u201d. 4) NHS composite 2 This says Labour should end all NHS outsourcing and return all outsourced services and staff to the NHS. 5) Social care composite This says Labour should \u201cmake the provision of all social care free to [the] recipient as is the case for health care under the NHS\u201d. Women\u2019s conference motion on migrant women This says Labour should end the detention of asylum seeking women, put a 28-day limit on all immigration detention and end charges for migrant and refugee women needing ante-natal and maternity care. Andrew Marr has replied to Jeremy Corbyn. (See 6.06pm.) The Independent Schools Council has said abolishing private schools would be an attack on parental freedom. (See 6.25pm.) Its chief executive, Julie Robinson, said: Parents across the country have every right to be worried about the decision by Labour party conference to support a motion to abolish independent schools. The move is an attack on the rights and freedoms of parents to make choices over the education of their children. Abolition would represent an act of national self-harm. Tearing down excellent schools does not improve our education system. The repercussions would be irreversible and far-reaching, damaging educational opportunities and limiting life chances. Moreover, Labour\u2019s plan would breach the European convention on human rights on the right to choose education. Of the five composite motions passed this afternoon, the most important is schools composite 1. (See 11.26am). Momentum, the pro-Corbyn organisation which by one estimate is backed by around 70% of CLP (constituency Labour party) delegates at the conference and which promoted schools composite 1, has just put out a news released headed: \u201cLabour commits to abolishing private schools in next manifesto.\u201d Laura Parker, Momentum\u2019s national coordinator, said: This is a huge step forward in dismantling the privilege of a tiny, Eton educated elite who are running our country into the ground. Every child deserves a world class education, not only those who are able pay for it, and I\u2019ll be proud to campaign on this manifesto pledge at the next election. When she was explaining Labour\u2019s policy earlier, Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, did not put it quite in these terms. She said Labour was committed the \u201cintegration\u201d of private schools into the state sector, which implies a more gradualist and voluntary approach. (See 11.26am.) John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, recently told the Guardian that he wanted an education system \u201cwhere private schools don\u2019t need to exist and should not exist where we have equality of education\u201d - which is also not quite the same as promising to close Eton against its wishes. But the text of schools composite 1 does back up the Momentum analysis of what it means. I quoted some of it earlier. For the record, here it is in full. I have used bold text to highlight the most significant sentence. Conference notes: Only 7% of UK students attend private schools, yet the Sutton Trust 2019 report revealed that 65% of senior judges, 52% of junior ministers, 44% of news columnists and 16% of university vice-chancellors were educated in private schools. Children at private schools have 300% more spent on their education than children in state schools. Participation in private schooling is concentrated at the very top of the family income distribution A Populus poll revealed 63% of the public agree, \u201cit is unfair that some people get a better education and life chances for their children by paying for a private school.\u201d Conference believes: Labour must go further than the 2017 manifesto to challenge the elite privilege of private schools who dominate the top professions. The on-going existence of private schools is incompatible with Labour\u2019s pledge to promote social justice, not social mobility in education. Labour is opposed to hierarchy, elitism and selection in education. Private schools reflect and reinforce class inequality in wider society. Conference resolves: To include in the next Labour party general election manifesto a commitment to integrate all private schools into the state sector. This would include, but is not limited to: Withdrawal of charitable status and all other public subsidies and tax privileges, including business rate exemption. Ensure universities admit the same proportion of private school students as in the wider population (currently 7%) Endowments, investments and properties held by private schools to be redistributed democratically and fairly across the country\u2019s educational institutions. Jeremy Corbyn has criticised the BBC for not giving enough attention to newspaper allegations that Boris Johnson failed to declare potential conflicts of interest while London mayor. Referring to a story broken by the Sunday Times saying Johnson allegedly failed to declare an interest in the allocation of public money to a close friend, Corbyn said: There was something important in one of the Sunday papers today about an alleged abuse of power and misuse of public funds by Boris Johnson before he became prime minister. But, do you know what? Lots of the media have barely touched it. Incredible, isn\u2019t it? This is about the man who is the prime minister of our country. Referring to his appearance on the Andrew Marr Show this morning, Corbyn said: I was on the BBC\u2019s flagship news programme this morning and I was asked about a range of issues. That\u2019s fine. It\u2019s right. It\u2019s justified. It\u2019s how our democracy works. But I was followed by Boris Johnson\u2019s deputy [Dominic Raab], who was asked nothing about these allegations. This is how the establishment works. They close ranks. They put privilege first. Things have to change. Labour will put people first before privilege. In the conference hall the \u201creference back\u201d votes are still going ahead. The row a moment ago (see 5.15pm) was about a procedural point that was barely comprehensible. But the broader story is clear, and quite interesting; members are complaining that they are not having as much influence over policy as they want. In their recent book on party political membership, Footsoldiers, the academics Tim Bale, Paul Webb and Monica Poletti reveal that in 2017 Labour members were more likely than members of any other main party (the Tories, the Lib Dems, the SNP, Greens and Ukip) to say that they should have more influence over party policy. At one level this was surprising because Tory members have almost zero influence over party policy, and Labour members have some influence. But the kind of people who join Labour expect to have a say over party policy, and when Jeremy Corbyn was elected leader he promised to give more power to the membership. Bale, Webb and Poletti write: The figures for the 2017 survey suggest, however, that [Corbyn] was not widely felt to have delivered on this promise during his first two years as leader - an impression only strengthened by subsequent developments: by 2019, there were unmistakeable signs of growing discontent among an overwhelmingly anti-Brexit membership of the way Jeremy Corbyn was dealing with this issue. This analysis does not take account the fact that this year the conference schedule has been changed to ensure that members do have more of a say in the past. As Luke Akehurst explains in this LabourList briefing, this year 20 priority ballot motions are being debated, not the usual four. That is a significant change. But, judging by some of the things being said on the floor of the conference, some members are not satisfied. Another delegate in the conference hall has just complained about the size of the union vote. \u201cThere is no point us voting here because everything we vote for just gets voted down,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just stay here and we can go to the pub?\u201d she added in exasperation. In his speech to the party conference Richard Burgon, the shadow justice secretary, said that a Labour government would reverse all the Tory cuts to legal aid-funded early legal help within 100 days of coming to power. Here is an extract from a Labour news release with more details. Early legal help is the legal support that people receive prior to a lawyer representing them in the courts. It is the kind of advice that many desperately need when faced everyday problems such as flawed benefits decisions or rogue landlords. Access to justice has been seriously undermined by the Tory and Liberal Democrats changes to legal aid, with hundreds of thousands of people unable to enforce their rights. In addition to Labour\u2019s previous commitments to restore this form of legal aid for housing cases, family law and welfare benefits appeals, this move will restore legal aid cuts for immigration cases, employment, debt, and mental health cases. A lack of early legal advice often creates extra costs for the taxpayer as cases go to court which could have been resolved earlier or spiral into costly social problems as people unnecessarily lose their homes or jobs. The United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights has said that cuts in legal aid meant many could no longer afford \u201cto challenge benefit denials or reductions and are thus effectively deprived of their human right to a remedy.\u201d In the conference hall delegates have voted to pass five composite motions, plus a motion from the women\u2019s conference. All were carried overwhelmingly. I will summarise what they say shortly. They are now voting on some \u201creference back\u201d proposals relating to policy commission reports. This is the process went wrong before lunch. (See 1.16pm.) There have been more complaints about the process not being clear, but this time the votes are going ahead. But one delegate complained about the voting system being unfair. The trade unions control almost half the votes at Labour conference. The delegate said this meant ordinary members kept getting defeated by the union vote. It should be one member, one vote, he said. According to ITV\u2019s Robert Peston, some members of Labour\u2019s national executive committee are saying that the Brexit policy statement that the NEC is supposed to have agreed (see 4.40pm) has not actually been agreed by the committee. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, has been speaking to the Guardian editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, at a fringe event. Here are some of the highlights from my colleague Frances Perraudin. The Mirror\u2019s Dan Bloom has the text of the Brexit motion being proposed by Labour\u2019s national executive committee. The wording is much the same as the draft circulating yesterday, but there are two changes. The new version adds references to the Good Friday agreement and to the rights of EU nationals to the paragraph about the Brexit deal a Labour government would seek to negotiate. And the final paragraph now says: The NEC believes it is right that the party shall only decide how to campaign in such a referendum - through a one-day special conference, following the election of a Labour government. What\u2019s new about this is the addition of the word \u201conly\u201d, which was not in yesterday\u2019s text. It has the effect of firming up the message. This means the leadership is heading for a clash with Labour remainers like Emily Thornberry, who want the matter settled now. (See 4.12pm.) Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, has renewed her call for Labour to decide this week whether or not it will back remain in a future referendum. Firming up what she said in a Guardian interview last week, she told a HuffPost fringe meeting: We\u2019re all here [at conference]. I don\u2019t see why we can\u2019t make the decision now ... I think that this conference should thrash it out. As the draft statement from Labour\u2019s national executive committee shows, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s current plan is for a Labour government to negotiate a new Brexit deal within three months of coming to power and to hold a referendum within six months of coming to power. The party would decide at a one-day special conference after the renegotiation how it would campaign in the referendum. The issue is due to be decided tomorrow. The conference will be asked to back the NEC statement, but many delegates will be pushing for a move to commit the party to backing remain in all circumstances. At least 80 motions have been submitted making this argument, and a meeting will take place tonight to roll these up into a composite. In her speech to the conference Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, said Tory policies were to blame for rising crime. She said: There is no question that the cuts in police numbers have contributed to the rise in crime. But other contributors are the cuts to education, the increase in school exclusions, all the zero-hours contracts, all the homelessness and inequality. All the cuts in mental health services have also played their part. And these are all Tory policies. When they say they will lead the fight against crime \u2013 do not believe a word of it. They are the ones who have created the conditions for rising serious and violent crime. Senior police officers are increasingly going on record and saying that cuts to public services have created an environment where crime flourishes. Cuts have consequences. You cannot keep people safe on the cheap. And she ended by saying Jeremy Corbyn would lead a \u201cgreat, reforming government\u201d. She explained: We will welcome refugees, including child refugees. We will proudly uphold the torture ban and treat the victims of torture with humanity, not detentions and deportations. We will end indefinite immigration detention, and limit it to the 28 days MPs were originally promised. And we will close Yarl\u2019s Wood and Brook House detention centres and review the entire detention estate. We will fund our police forces properly, and work to give our communities genuine security. We will hold public inquiries into historic injustices \u2013 into Orgreave, into blacklisting. We will release all papers relating to the Shrewsbury 24 trials and the 37 Cammell Laird shipyard workers. I owe everything in life to the Labour movement. There was a postwar generation of socialists who campaigned against colonialism. There was the NHS orange juice and cod-liver oil. There was my free university education. And above all the chance to serve as Britain\u2019s first black woman MP. Speaking at a fringe meeting about how Labour can win back support in its heartlands, Jon Trickett \u2013 shadow Cabinet Office minister and MP for Hemsworth \u2013 said he was fed up with the argument that the people who voted for Brexit were from \u201cbackwards\u201d communities in the north of England. He said: Here\u2019s the point I want to make. Those held-back communities \u2013 the heartland communities \u2013 can be found in Hastings, they can be found in Hackney and they can be found in Hartlepool. A very senior member of the Labour party, she said to me: \u2018Well, no wonder they\u2019re all coming down south, the young people, because you can\u2019t be gay up north.\u2019 That was said by somebody whose name you will have mentioned several times in the past few weeks. He later said: Those people who are suggesting that the people who voted for Brexit did not know what they were voting for infantilises 17 million people. In his speech to the conference this morning Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said a Labour government would halt hospital closures pending reviews looking at clinical evidence and social impact. He said: Local hospitals and health centres are part of the fabric of society. They are valued local employers. Often where our children are born, or where we finally say goodbye to our loved ones. Shut services down and something invaluable vanishes from a community. Of course, nothing stays the same. Medicine advances. Treatments evolve. New facilities are built. I think we all understand that. But we need more capacity, not less. So I can tell you cuts and closures because of Boris Johnson\u2019s austerity will be halted, suspended and decisions reviewed based on clinical evidence and social impact instead. This is from Kay Boycott, the chief executive of Asthma UK, welcoming Labour\u2019s announcement today that it would end prescription charges in England. We have been campaigning hard for years to stop the unfair prescription charges for people with asthma that are putting them at risk of having a life-threatening asthma attack, so it is hugely heartening that our concerns have been heard and the Labour party has now committed to scrapping prescription charges for everyone in England. An estimated 1.3 million people with asthma have cut back on their medication because of the cost, which puts them at risk of a potentially life-threatening asthma attack. Hundreds of nurses have seen their patients have asthma attacks or need emergency treatment because they can\u2019t afford to pay their prescriptions. This is unacceptable and unfair. No one should have to pay to breathe. Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, told a fringe meeting at lunchtime that he also wanted the party to adopt an unequivocally pro-remain stance. He told the New Statesman event: We are at a vital crossroads. Neutrality is not an option. The party should be unequivocally pro-remain. All Labour MPs should be whipped to campaign for remain. For a more colourful insight into what Len McCluskey probably thinks about Labour remainers, it is worth reading The Fall and Rise of the British Left, a new book by Andrew Murray, the chief of staff at McCluskey\u2019s Unite union, and a part-time adviser to Jeremy Corbyn. Murray writes: Brexit Derangement Syndrome, a fever which has long prostrated the Conservative party, now runs riot on the left and has the potential to destroy the broad-based alliance for progressive social change assembled under Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership of Labour. Were it to become a full-on \u2018remain\u2019 party, as many politicians and pundits want, setting aside the decision of the 2016 referendum, it would endanger decisive layers of time-honoured support now regarded as out of joint with the new enlightenment. It would be a Hilary Clinton strategy in short. There are plenty of other reasons why it\u2019s worth reading Murray\u2019s book. It doesn\u2019t contain any Corbyn office gossip, but it is well-written, sometimes funny and probably the best guide currently available to the ideology at the heart of Corbynism. In his Sky News interview, the Unite general secretary, Len McCluskey, also denied being involved in the attempt on Friday night to get Labour\u2019s national executive committee to abolish the post of deputy leader. As PoliticsHome reports, McCluskey said the claim that he was involved (he and Watson are bitter enemies now, having once been friends) was \u201cfake news\u201d. Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary, has also been calling for unity this morning. But, unlike his fellow union leader Dave Prentis, whose call for unity was broadly supportive of Tom Watson (see 12.58pm), McCluskey said that if members of the shadow cabinet like Watson were not willing to back Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s line on Brexit, they should resign. Speaking on Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday, when asked if he had a message for senior Labour figures who were arguing that the party should commit to campaigning for remain in any second referendum on Brexit, he replied: My message is to support the leader \u2026 We must go into an election united. And when we have a policy on Brexit, and Jeremy Corbyn makes it clear that that is the policy, then that\u2019s what leading members of the shadow cabinet should argue for. If they find that they can\u2019t argue for it because they feel strongly, well of course they have that right, but they should step aside, and step aside from the shadow cabinet, which will become the cabinet, and they can argue whatever they want. But the policy and my appeals to them, and to Emily [Thornberry, shadow foreign secretary] and to anybody else is, support your leader \u2026 If we get to a position where Jeremy is saying: \u2018Let\u2019s not make our decision on how we will campaign until we know what the deal [is],\u2019 my appeal to her \u2013 support Jeremy and that\u2019s my appeal to the whole of conference. Asked if that meant he was unhappy with people saying the party should commit now to backing remain in any future referendum, McCluskey said he was if these people were \u201cin the leadership\u201d. He explained: In this situation \u2026 in order for Labour to get through the message of unity and healing our nation, everybody needs to be singing from the same hymn sheet. Now if the leadership team \u2013 the shadow cabinet, soon to be the cabinet \u2013 find that difficult then yes they should step aside. A reminder: among those people who have been saying today that Labour should commit now to backing remain in a second referendum come what may are: Tom Watson, the deputy leader (see 12.39pm), Richard Leonard, the Scottish Labour leader (see 12.16pm), and Mark Drakeford, the Welsh Labour leader and Welsh first minister (see 11.47pm). The morning session in the conference hall has just ended. Delegates were supposed to have a series of votes \u2013 including on the private schools composite (see 11.26am) \u2013 but the votes had to be abandoned after a few minutes of chaos. The chair, Andi Fox, called a vote on a proposal to \u201creference back\u201d part of the early years policy commission report. But two delegates used points of order to complain that they did not know exactly what bit they were referencing back, the chair was unable to explain, and after an outbreak of angry shouting from the hall she announced that all the votes would be put off until the afternoon. In the debate on health and social care Dave Prentis, the general secretary of Unison, urged Labour to unite, in an implicit criticism of the attempt to abolish the post of deputy Labour leader. He told the conference: We all know, in our heart of hearts, that to save the NHS there is only one option: Labour has to win power. Divided parties never get elected. So we owe it to our NHS to leave Britain this week united \u2026 What members need like never before is a Labour government. So less of the triggering, less of the denouncing, less of the deleting \u2013 that is the road to nowhere. Let\u2019s get behind our leader, Jeremy, let\u2019s get out there, get the NHS back in our hands, and our great party back in power. Prentis went slightly further in a tweet on this subject yesterday. And this is from my colleague Rajeev Syal, who has been at Tom Watson\u2019s fringe event. These are from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg. Tom Watson, the deputy Labour leader, has been speaking at a lunchtime fringe meeting. According to extracts from his speech sent out in advance, he repeated his call for Labour to commit to backing remain in any second referendum. He said: This week we have the opportunity to unite the Labour party around a position we believe in. Jeremy Corbyn has been right to try to bring the country \u2013 both leave and remain voters \u2013 back together. Offering everyone in the country the final say is the best way to begin bridging this divide. The vast majority of our members, our MPs and our voters want to remain in Europe. If we achieve a people\u2019s vote, I believe our members, our MPs and our party will lead the campaign to remain. That\u2019s not just because it is the best way of reconnecting with our voters, but also because it is the best way of standing up for our values. We are a remain party. We are a European party. We are an internationalist party. That is who we are. Not perfect, not pure. But overwhelmingly committed to Britain remaining in Europe and reforming Europe. By backing a people\u2019s vote, by backing remain, I am sure we can deliver the Labour government the people of this country so badly need. Attempts to reinstate a key \u201csocialist\u201d section of Labour\u2019s constitution have been rejected, PA Media reports. A rule change aimed at restoring the original wording of clause IV was pushed by some members at the party\u2019s annual conference in Brighton. Under this clause in Labour\u2019s 1918 constitution, the party was committed to the \u201ccommon ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange\u201d. But one such proposal to reinstate the original wording was defeated by 71.53% to 28.47% while another was rejected by 68.58% to 31.42%. As PA reports, both secured a majority of support among votes cast by constituency Labour parties but more than 99% of votes from affiliates \u2013 which include trade unions \u2013 opposed the change. The votes were held yesterday, but because there were card votes, the results were only announced this morning. And this is what Richard Leonard, the Scottish Labour leader, said on the BBC\u2019s Sunday Politics Scotland about whether Labour should back a second independence referendum in Scotland. The Scottish Labour party has in the past firmly opposed the idea, but in August Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said a Labour government in London would not object to such a poll being held. Subsequently Leonard and Corbyn agreed a compromise line. Explaining the position today, Leonard said: The Labour position going into the general election whenever it comes will be that we oppose the creation of a separate Scottish state, that we oppose independence and therefore that we oppose the holding of a second independence referendum. Where there has been some discussion is around if there was to be a renewed mandate which showed not only electoral but demonstrable public support for the holding of a second referendum \u2013 then there would need to be some consideration given to that. We had an independence referendum just five years ago and that\u2019s got to be a factor in considering whether the circumstances are right for a second independence referendum to be held. All of the evidence shows that even people who voted yes in 2014, even some people who are supporting the SNP, do not think that the time is now for a second independence referendum. The circumstances under which the 2014 referendum were held were that the SNP had gained an overall majority \u2013 unprecedented, completely unexpected \u2013 and there was an understanding that there had never been an independence referendum and the time might be right to test it. What I\u2019m saying is I don\u2019t see the circumstances today and I don\u2019t see them in the foreseeable future where we would be back in that kind of space again. Richard Leonard, the Scottish Labour leader, like his Welsh counterpart Mark Drakeford (see 11.47am) has said Labour should back remain in any future referendum. Speaking on the BBC\u2019s Sunday Politics Scotland, Leonard said: The Scottish Labour party took a decision frankly in the wake of the European party election results that we needed to be much clearer, that we needed much greater clarity about the position that we were taking. For that reason the Scottish executive of the Labour party backed my proposal that we call for an affirmative vote that any deal should go back to the public; secondly, that on that vote there should be a remain option; and thirdly, that we would campaign unambiguously for remain. I would support the party taking that stance. I do think the time has come for clarity on this question and the Scottish Labour party, the Welsh Labour party take a similar view that we should be more overtly remain. According to the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith, tomorrow delegates are due to get a vote on two Brexit options \u2013 a composite motion saying the party should back remain in all circumstances, and a compromise motion tabled by the national executive committee setting out the leadership\u2019s position. Here is the text of the NEC motion. The Welsh Labour party is firmly committed to the UK remaining in the EU in all circumstances, unlike the UK Labour party. That is also the position of the Labour-run Welsh government. This is what Mark Drakeford, the Welsh first minister, told the conference in his speech this morning. Faced with the deep and lasting damage this hard Tory Brexit will do to our country, we say it\u2019s time to go back to the people in a second referendum with remain on the ballot paper. And conference, I can tell you now that my Welsh Labour government will continue to stand up for Wales by campaigning wholeheartedly, vigorously and unapologetically, for Wales to remain in the EU. Brexit has torn at the very fabric of the things we cherish, including the United Kingdom itself. Those pursuing Brexit have used \u2013 and misused \u2013 the union for their own narrow and ideological ends. To drive us away from the partnerships we have developed with our European friends over so many years. We should be under no doubt that the voluntary union of our four sovereign nations here in the UK is under threat if we do not act. The Labour conference is debating education at the moment. In her speech, Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, said a Labour government would be committed to the \u201cintegration\u201d of private schools into the state sector. She told delegates: That is why we\u2019ll upgrade social mobility to social justice, turning the Social Mobility Commission into the Social Justice Commission. And we will set that commission to work on making the whole education system fairer through the integration of private schools. John McDonnell and I will set out the further steps a Labour government would take. But I can say today that our very first budget will immediately close the tax loopholes used by elite private schools, and use that money to improve the lives of all children. Quite what this pledge means in practice is not clear. As Rayner says, Labour wants to take away the tax advantages private schools enjoy, which would make private education more expensive, and perhaps as a result less desirable. But delegates want Labour to go further. The conference is currently debating two composite motions on schools. One of them \u2013 schools composite 1, moved by Battersea CLP \u2013 says \u201cthe ongoing existence of private schools is incompatible with Labour\u2019s pledge to promote social justice, not social mobility in education\u201d. It goes on: Conference resolves: To include in the next Labour party general election manifesto a commitment to integrate all private schools into the state sector. That would include, but is not limited to: Withdrawal of charitable status and all other public subsidies and tax privileges including business rate exemption. Ensure universities admit the same proportion of private school pupils as in the wider population (currently 7%). Endowments, investments and properties held by private schools to be redistributed democratically and fairly across the country\u2019s educational institutions. Here are the main points from Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s interview with Andrew Marr. Corbyn said the UK could be better off outside the EU than within if the right Brexit deal were available. (See 10am.) While recognising that most party members wanted the UK to remain in the EU, Corbyn said it was important to recognise why 17 million people voted to leave. He said: Please remember why people voted leave, why people voted remain, but also remember there is more that unites all of those people \u2013 over austerity, over investment, over education, over housing, over health, over a green industrial revolution \u2013 than there is that divides them. He said that if the conference voted for Labour to campaign for remain in all circumstances, he would respect that decision. At the moment his policy is for Labour to offer voters a choice between remain and a credible leave option in a referendum after the election, and for the party to decide its stance at the time. But, when asked if he would agree to campaign for remain regardless if the conference voted for that this week (Brexit is being debated tomorrow), Corbyn replied: I will go along with whatever decision the party comes to. He did not rule out giving Labour MPs a free vote if Boris Johnson brings a deal back to the Commons. However, he implied this was unlikely. Asked if a free vote was possible, he replied: I would hope we could vote together as a party on this. And that is what I\u2019ve tried to do all the way through. He said Labour and other opposition parties would use Commons votes to block a further suspension of parliament if the supreme court ruled that the current suspension (prorogation) was unlawful. The court is due to announce its ruling early next week, and Corbyn said there should be an immediate recall of parliament in those circumstances. And he said: If [the supreme court] decide that parliament should be recalled \u2026 then we would seek to take immediate action in parliament to prevent him closing down parliament all the way through to 31 October. So I would work with the other opposition parties, as we have up to now. Corbyn did not say how opposition parties might stop a second prorogation. It is normally just up to the prime minister to decide when parliament is prorogued. Corbyn said he did not know that his ally Jon Lansman was going to call a vote at Labour\u2019s national executive committee meeting on Friday calling for the post of deputy leader to be abolished. He said he was aware of general talk about changing the role, but not that this motion was going to be proposed. He said: I was not aware that the particular motion was going to be moved at that time, but I knew there were people discussing options. Corbyn also claimed the move was not directed against Watson personally. When it was put to him that he should have known what was being planned, he replied: I\u2019m not all-seeing and all-knowing \u2013 I\u2019d love to be. Corbyn dismisses concerns about the operation of his office raised by his policy adviser Andrew Fisher in a private memo about his decision to resign. When asked why the memo referred to colleagues having a \u201clack of human decency\u201d and a issuing a \u201cblizzard of lies\u201d, Corbyn confirmed that he had read the document. He went on: I think [Fisher] said that because he was extremely distressed at that point about whatever was going on in discussions within the office at that moment. I would have thought similar memos fly around the BBC pretty much every day. Corbyn also stressed that Fisher would stay in his job until the end of the year and said he had had a \u201cvery convivial\u201d coffee with Fisher and other members of his team only this morning. He went on: He is a great colleague, a great friend \u2026 I\u2019ve worked with Andrew for 15 years, when I was a backbencher and many other times. He is a great writer, he\u2019s a great thinker and he\u2019s done a huge amount of work in the party. We get along absolutely very well and he\u2019s promised that whatever happens in the future he will be working with me on policy issues. Corbyn rejected suggestions that he might be about to step down. He said he would lead the party into the general election and serve a full term as PM if he won. (There were claims that the move to oust Tom Watson was prompted by fears that Corbyn might be close to resigning, which would raise the prospect of Watson taking over as interim leader.) Corbyn defended Labour\u2019s decision, announced today, to commit to abolishing Ofsted. Asked why he was doing this, Corbyn replied: Because it is a very assertive form of investigation into a school. They turn up every few years, or sometimes more frequently than that, and do an exercise on that school and then make a decision about it. The level of stress on the students and the teachers is absolutely enormous. What we want instead is a more frequent form of supportive investigation of schools and examination of them through HMI, Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectors of schools, but also through local authorities. It\u2019s part of reinvigorating local education authorities to administer all schools within that community area. He said that if he became PM he would try to fly less than his predecessors and use trains more. \u201cI fly as little as I can now,\u201d he said. \u201cI take trains wherever I can.\u201d Promising to do the same in government, he said \u201can example has to be set\u201d. Here is the full exchange with Andrew Marr where Jeremy Corbyn said the UK could be better off outside the EU than inside in some circumstances. AM: One of your first jobs [as PM] is go to Brussels and negotiate a new Brexit deal \u2026 In that context, is it your view that Britain is better off inside the European Union or better off, long-term, outside the European Union? Which? JC: [It] depends on the agreement you have with the European Union outside. AM: So we could be better off outside, therefore? JC: Listen, what I\u2019ve tried to do all along is recognise the result of the referendum and respect it. That\u2019s what we said in our 2017 manifests, which is why we voted before that to invoke article 50 \u2026 We have consistently put forward what I believe to be a credible option, which is what we call the five pillars which is the customs union, the trade relationship, protection of consumer, environmental and workers\u2019 rights, and of course, the Good Friday agreement and the peace process \u2026 I recognise the majority of Labour party supporters and members support remain and supported remain, but a significant minority voted the other way. Q: Why do you want to abolish Ofsted? Corbyn says inspections are causing too much stresss. And that\u2019s it. The interview is over. I will post a summary and reaction as soon as possible. Q: If you become PM, will you fly less than normal PMs? Corbyn says he flies as little as he can. He will take trains as often as he can. He says he wants to set an example. Corbyn says he would try to travel by train where possible as PM. Corbyn says, if the supreme court decides prorogation was unlawful, he and other opposition parties would try to ensure Johnson cannot prorogue again. He says the Commons should be recalled if that is what the supreme court decides. He hopes that happens. Corbyn says he and other opposition parties may try to stop Johnson suspending parliament again. Q: You could avoid no deal by voting for a deal Boris Johnson brings back. Do you agree? Corbyn says Johnson has not brought a deal back. He has been PM since July, but we have not seen one. Q: Should Labour back a deal? It depends what it is, says Corbyn. But he says all his instincts are telling him to that Johnson does not want a deal. Q: Would you allow Labour MPs a free vote on any Johnson deal? Corbyn says he would hope that the party would be able to have a united line on this (ie, that he would not allow one). Corbyn does not rule out giving Labour MPs a free vote on any Boris Johnson Brexit deal. Q: If the conference votes for Labour to be unequivocally a remain party, will you accept it? Corbyn says he will accept what the party decides. But he wants people to remember the concerns of the 17 million people who voted to leave, he says. Q: Are you ignoring the views of those who want a \u201cclean-break Brexit\u201d? Corbyn says the views of these people do matter to him. But people were not told the truth about what Brexit would involve. He says the government has tried to hide the truth about what Brexit would involve. Q: Do you think the UK would be better off staying in the EU or outside? Corbyn says it would depend on what the deal to leave would be like. Corbyn suggests UK could be better off outside the EU than within it. He says it is important to recognise that the country voted to leave. Q: So if Michel Barnier gives you the Labour version of Brexit, would you campaign enthusiastically for it? Corbyn says he wants to be able to put a sensible leave deal to the public. Q: So if you get a good Brexit deal, do you then campaign for it? Corbyn says: Let\u2019s see what we get, and we will put that final deal to the British people. Q: Why can\u2019t you answer? Because we don\u2019t know if we have got it yet, says Corbyn. Q: So at the moment you are staying neutral? Corbyn says Labour would have a special conference to decide. Q: Will you definitely be Labour leader during the election and afterwards? Corbyn says he will be taking the party into the election as leader. Q: And would you serve a full term? Yes, says Corbyn. Corbyn says he would serve a full term as prime minister. Q: Do you recognise the words in the memo from Andrew Fisher, leaked to the Sunday Times? Corbyn says he has read the memo and discussed it with Fisher. He says Fisher is doing a stressful job. He wants to spend more time with his family. But Fisher is here at the conference. They had a discussion this morning. Q: Why did he talk about a \u201cblizzard of lies\u201d in the office? Fisher says that might have been because of what happened in the office that day. He says office disagreements happen everywhere. He suggests there might be similar memos about what happens on the Marr show. Fisher will continue to advise him on policy, he says. Corbyn plays down Andrew Fisher\u2019s concerns about how Corbyn\u2019s office is run, suggesting these are just normal workplace disputes. Q: If you did not know about this, why not? Corbyn says: I am not all-seeing and all-knowing \u2026 I would like to be. Jeremy Corbyn is being interviewed by Andrew Marr now. Asked if he knew in advance about the move to abolish Tom Watson\u2019s post, Corbyn says he did not know a motion was going to be put to the national executive committee. But he knew that there had been talk about changing the role, he says. Q: Two of your allies, Diane Abbott and Rebecca Long-Bailey, voted to get rid of Watson\u2019s post at that NEC meeting. Have you spoken to them about it? Corbyn says this move did not work. Corbyn says he did not know in advance about move to get NEC to vote to abolish Tom Watson\u2019s post. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, also told Sky News that he did not know if Jeremy Corbyn knew in advance about the attempt on Friday night by Jon Lansman, the Momentum founder, to get the national executive committee to abolish Tom Watson\u2019s post. Andrew Fisher, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s policy chief, has been tweeting this morning about the plan to abolish prescription charges in England. Fisher has not said anything on his Twitter feed about his decision to resign, or the reasons for it. Here is an extract from the Sunday Times\u2019s inside story (paywall) about the Labour conference and the reasons for Fisher\u2019s resignation. In his resignation note to allies, Fisher claimed that \u201cclass war\u201d had gripped the upper echelons of the party. Insiders say this is a reference to the dominance of Corbyn\u2019s most senior aide, Seumas Milne, and his sidekick James Schneider, both of whom were educated at Winchester and Oxford, over party planning, messaging, Brexit and the election campaign. Andrew Murray \u2013 a former communist with aristocratic forebears, who wielded great influence \u2013 has only recently taken a step back because he is unwell. Last week Milne selected the strapline \u201cpeople before privilege\u201d, a move that led one Labour staffer to remark: \u201cThat proves irony is dead \u2013 two people with privilege came up with that.\u201d Fisher also accused Corbyn\u2019s senior aides of having \u201cconnived\u201d to leak policies designed to be made public at conference and then lied to him about it. And he revealed that a speech he was working on and a pamphlet he had signed off were pulled at the last minute without explanation and that a confidential document he was working on was left on a printer for anyone to read. On Sky Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, is being interviewed now. He says his plan to abolish prescription charges in England would cost around \u00a3745m. He says the party will explain how it will fund this when it publishes its manifesto costings at the next election. In Scotland and Wales there are no prescription charges, he says. Here is our version of the story about the resignation of Andrew Fisher, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s chief policy adviser. This is from Tim Shipman, who broke the story in the Sunday Times. These are from Shipman defending his scoop. And here is the New Statesman\u2019s Stephen Bush on the story. Here are the timings of the main events in the conference hall. 9.50am: Report from Harry Donaldson, chair of the conference arrangements committee. 10am: Mark Drakeford, the Welsh first minister, speaks. 10.10am: Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, speaks in a debate on education. 11.20am: Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, and Mark Serwotka, the general secretary of the PCS union, speak in a debate on health and social care. 2.15pm: Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, and Richard Burgon, the shadow justice secretary, speaking in a debate on justice and home affairs. It\u2019s the first full day of Labour conference, but already it feels as if there has been enough news to fill the whole week. On Friday night there was the surprise attempt to abolish the post of deputy leader. By lunchtime yesterday the plot had been abandoned, but it was a stark reminder of how deep divisions are in the party, partly over Brexit but also over Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership. The row has distracted attention from the fact that this is also a policy-rich conference, with Labour announcing a cache of policies likely to feature in the forthcoming general election. Here are the main stories around this morning. Jeremy Corbyn was struggling to contain an open revolt by some of his most senior shadow ministers, MPs and party activists last night as anger over his refusal to back a policy of remaining in the EU threatened to wreck the Labour conference. Corbyn has told the Sunday Mirror that he would like Labour to have two deputy leaders. Referring to the failed attempt to abolish Tom Watson\u2019s post, and the way he defused it at a meeting of Labour\u2019s national executive committee yesterday, Corbyn said: I told the national executive we need to review how the deputy leadership works and have an election process for two deputy leaders in the future which reflects diversity within our society so one would be a woman. It was agreed overwhelmingly. Last year Labour was expected to vote to create a second deputy leader\u2019s post but the plan was unexpectedly shelved at the last minute \u2013 reportedly because the leadership feared that the election for the second deputy leader would turn into a proxy ballot on Corbyn\u2019s Brexit policy, with members electing a candidate strongly backing a second referendum (which at the time Corbyn was resisting). Corbyn has played down his differences with Watson, telling the Sunday Mirror that disagreements on policy are inevitable in a shadow cabinet. Corbyn said: I\u2019ve got a shadow cabinet with great energy. Diane Abbott says she disagrees with me three times a day but totally supports my leadership. When you have people who are very politically committed there are bound to be debates. Andrew Fisher, a key adviser to Jeremy Corbyn, has reportedly quit saying the Labour leader cannot win the next general election. Labour is pledging to abolish Ofsted and end \u201chigh stakes\u201d school inspections as part of radical plans drawn up before a possible snap election. There are more details of the party\u2019s plans here. Labour is promising to abolish prescription charges in England. Labour is announcing plans to abolish ineffective short prison sentences. The shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon, said: Sending people to prison for a few weeks is often the worst way to tackle the drug addictions, mental health and debt problems that lead to people to commit certain crimes in the first place. The Ministry of Justice\u2019s own evidence shows there would be tens of thousands fewer crimes if ineffective short prison sentences were scrapped. For some offenders \u2013 including those who have committed rape, murder and other violent or sexual offences \u2013 prison will always be necessary. But jailing others for a few weeks in a prison system in crisis reduces the chances of rehabilitation, making reoffending more likely. Yet thousands of people are being jailed each year for shoplifting and figures I recently uncovered show nearly half of all women sent to prison were homeless. Instead of the Tories investing scarce justice resources in new prison places that just repeats the errors of the past, we will invest in effective alternatives that keep people safe. Labour has said Boris Johnson must explain newspaper allegations that he failed to declare potential conflicts of interest while London mayor in relation to the allocation of public money to an American woman. As the Press Association reports, the Sunday Times reports the potential conflicts arose through Johnson\u2019s association with the model-turned-technology-entrepreneur Jennifer Arcuri, who moved to London seven years ago. The paper says Arcuri was given \u00a3126,000 in public money and was afforded privileged access to three foreign trade missions Johnson led. Jon Trickett, Labour\u2019s shadow Cabinet Office minister, said Johnson should provide full disclosure on the allegations. Trickett said: Boris Johnson must now give a full account of his actions in response to these grave and most serious allegations of the misuse use of public money in his former role as mayor of London. The public has a right to know how and why these funds were used for the benefit of a close personal friend without on the face of it legitimate reason. This cannot be swept under the carpet. It is a matter of the integrity of the man now leading our country, who appears to believe he can get away with anything. Here is the agenda for the day. 8.30am: The Unite leader, Len McCluskey, is among the guests on Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday. 9am: Jeremy Corbyn is interviewed on the Andrew Marr Show. 9.45am: The conference opens. Those speaking during the day include the Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, the shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, the shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, and the shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will focusing almost exclusively on the Labour conference. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "bodyText": "Labour delegates have endorsed radical plans that would abolish private schools by removing their charitable status and redistributing their endowments, investments and properties to the state sector. Conference delegates approved a motion that said such a commitment should be included in the party\u2019s next general election manifesto. The motion added universities would be limited to admitting the same proportion of private school students as in the wider population, currently 7%. The vote in favour of the motion came after the shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said a future Labour government would scrap the \u201ctax loopholes\u201d that benefit private schools in its first budget. And it followed Rayner\u2019s announcement that Labour would overhaul school inspections in England by abolishing Ofsted, a proposal that received a mixed welcome by teachers and prompted accusations of lowering standards by its opponents. Sunday\u2019s controversial step on private schools, which would represent a existential threat to their dominance of the most influential roles in the establishment, was greeted enthusiastically by the Abolish Eton campaign, which has pushed the issue up the party\u2019s agenda. Holly Rigby, a campaign organiser and state school teacher said: \u201cThis is a really positive moment for the Labour party because it\u2019s the strongest commitment that the party has made to deal with the problem of private schools in a very long time. It\u2019s a really radical commitment as well \u2026 This is a really big victory for the left.\u201d But Julie Robinson, the chief executive of the Independent Schools Council, which represents about 1,000 private schools in England including Eton, said Labour\u2019s vote was an attack on the rights of parents. \u201cTearing down excellent schools does not improve our education system. The repercussions would be irreversible and far-reaching, damaging educational opportunities and limiting life chances. Moreover, Labour\u2019s plan would breach the European Convention on Human Rights on the right to choose education,\u201d Robinson said. Rayner said she backed the efforts, and said that a new social justice commission would be tasked with integrating private schools into the state system. \u201cOur very first budget will immediately close the tax loopholes used by elite private schools and use that money to improve the lives of all children,\u201d Rayner said. Labour also set out a major shake up of Ofsted, with Rayner telling conference delegates in Brighton: \u201cSchools will no longer be reduced to a one-word grade or subjected to a system that hounds teachers from the classroom.\u201d Instead Rayner promised \u201ca new system of peer review will deliver school improvement led by the experts in our schools who can achieve more working together for the common good\u201d. While the move was applauded by teaching unions such as the NASUWT, a snap poll conducted by Teacher Tapp, a nationally representative survey of more than 5,000 teachers in England, found that 41% supported Labour\u2019s proposal while 36% opposed it and 23% were undecided. Prof Becky Allen, chief analyst at Teacher Tapp, said the results showed a split between different parts of the profession. While the call to abolish Ofsted was supported by a majority of head teachers and primary teachers, just a third of secondary teachers said they backed it.

Goals from Andriy Yarmolenko and Aaron Cresswell consigned the visitors to defeat and the Sky TV pundits piled in on them, with Roy Keane, the former United captain, saying he was \u201cshocked and saddened by how bad they are\u201d. He added: \u201cEverything about United was lacklustre. No quality. A lack of desire. A lack of leaders. It\u2019s a long way back for them.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r, who reported that Marcus Rashford would \u201cprobably be out for a little while\u201d with the groin injury that forced him off, argued it was a game of fine margins in which West Ham took their chances and United did not. \u201cThis group wants to do what we\u2019re trying to do,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said. \u201cThere are key moments in games that can tip them in our favour or theirs \u2013 maybe you make a bad decision on a pass \u2013 but the attitude and desire is there.

The 52-year-old served as a minister in the Labour government and was appointed the deputy chair of the NEC by Ed Miliband.<br></p>\n    <p>Watson stepped in to personally handle complaints in the midst of Labour\u2019s antisemitism crisis. He backed automatic exclusion of members <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/11/labour-antisemitism-claims-automatic-exclusions-tom-watson\">accused of anti-Jewish racism</a>.</p>\n    <p>Earlier this year, Watson called on centrist MPs to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/18/tom-watson-labour-must-not-fail-uk-at-crucial-point-in-brexit\">stay and fight within the Labour party</a>, putting an end to rumours he would lead a split of centrist Labour MPs.</p>\n    <p>In his speech earlier this month, Watson said his party must \u201cunambiguously and unequivocally back remain\u201d in a second referendum, a move that Jeremy Corbyn believes to be the wrong approach.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>As well as regularly being in conflict with the Labour leadership, Watson has had a long-running feud with Len McCluskey, the general secretary of Unite, Labour\u2019s biggest donor. The pair, who were once close friends, have clashed over Corbyn\u2019s leadership and Brexit.</p>\n    <p>Watson said he was in a Chinese restaurant in Manchester when he heard of the motion to scrap his position within the Labour party. He described the move as a \u201cstraight sectarian attack on a broad church party\u201d, adding it was \u201ca sort of sleight of hand of constitutional change to do a drive-by shooting of someone you disagree with on the issue of the day.\u201d</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>She added: \u201cTom Watson is going around very relaxed and happy. He\u2019s relaxed and happy, you [the media] should be relaxed and happy.\u201d</p> \n<p>Abbott said that despite Corbyn\u2019s low personal approval ratings, the media would be foolish to write his chances off and she was still confident she would one day become the first black female home secretary.</p> \n<p>\u201cDo you know the 2017 manifesto was a great manifesto, but it wasn\u2019t that radical,\u201d she said. \u201cIn Sweden it would be seen as a perfectly mainstream social democratic manifesto.\u201d</p> \n<p>Of the subject of next election\u2019s Labour manifesto, she said: \u201cHopefully Andrew Fisher will be part of drawing it up \u2026 and it will be a strong social democratic manifesto.\u201d</p> \n<p>Abbott added that she was not concerned that Labour voters would be attracted by the Liberal Democrats\u2019 unequivocally remain stance, saying they could still remember that party\u2019s U-turn on tuition fees when it went into coalition with the Conservatives in 2010.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think people are going to weigh up the attraction of Jo Swinson\u2019s position with their commitment and loyalty to the Labour party. It\u2019s not just as simple as: \u2018if you are a remainer you are going to vote Lib Dem\u2019 and \u2018if you area leaver you are going to vote for the Brexit party\u2019. People are going to have to weigh up what\u2019s most important to them.\u201d</p> \n<p>In a \u201cquick-fire round\u201d to end the interview, Abbott said she would choose Bernie Sanders over Elizabeth Warren as the US Democratic party\u2019s next presidential candidate, a general election over a second referendum and Ken Livingstone over Ken Clarke.</p> \n<p>Asked to choose between Boris Johnson\u2019s aide Dominic Cummings and Tony Blair\u2019s former spin doctor Alastair Campbell, she chose Campbell. \u201cAlastair remains actually a Labour man,\u201d she said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Diane Abbott has urged a key adviser to Jeremy Corbyn who resigned citing a lack of \u201cprofessionalism, competence and human decency\u201d in the Labour leader\u2019s team to reconsider his decision. In a leaked resignation memo to colleagues, Andrew Fisher, who masterminded the party\u2019s 2017 manifesto, said he no longer had faith that Labour would be successful and accused the leadership team of making a \u201cblizzard of lies and excuses\u201d. Speaking to the editor-in-chief of the Guardian, Katharine Viner, at an event on the second day of the Labour party\u2019s conference in Brighton, the shadow home secretary said she had not read the note, so would not comment on it. \u201cI know Andrew Fisher. He was the last remaining member of Jeremy\u2019s leadership campaign,\u201d Abbott said on Sunday. \u201cHe is very good at what he does. \u201cHe was the architect for the 2017 manifesto and he is actually a Jeremy loyalist and a close friend of Jeremy. What I would say is that I think Andrew is an asset to the Labour movement and I would want to say that even at this late stage he should reconsider his resignation.\u201d The news of Fisher\u2019s resignation was first reported in the Sunday Times the day after Corbyn intervened to halt a surprise attempt by the party\u2019s national executive committee (NEC) to remove Tom Watson as deputy leader by abolishing the post. \u201cThis must be my 30th Labour party conference and I can\u2019t remember one where the media weren\u2019t running around like headless chickens talking about Labour splits,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cIf the NEC had a discussion as to whether to have chocolate biscuits or ginger, people like you would be saying there were Labour splits.\u201d She added: \u201cTom Watson is going around very relaxed and happy. He\u2019s relaxed and happy, you [the media] should be relaxed and happy.\u201d Abbott said that despite Corbyn\u2019s low personal approval ratings, the media would be foolish to write his chances off and she was still confident she would one day become the first black female home secretary. \u201cDo you know the 2017 manifesto was a great manifesto, but it wasn\u2019t that radical,\u201d she said. \u201cIn Sweden it would be seen as a perfectly mainstream social democratic manifesto.\u201d Of the subject of next election\u2019s Labour manifesto, she said: \u201cHopefully Andrew Fisher will be part of drawing it up \u2026 and it will be a strong social democratic manifesto.\u201d Abbott added that she was not concerned that Labour voters would be attracted by the Liberal Democrats\u2019 unequivocally remain stance, saying they could still remember that party\u2019s U-turn on tuition fees when it went into coalition with the Conservatives in 2010. \u201cI think people are going to weigh up the attraction of Jo Swinson\u2019s position with their commitment and loyalty to the Labour party. It\u2019s not just as simple as: \u2018if you are a remainer you are going to vote Lib Dem\u2019 and \u2018if you area leaver you are going to vote for the Brexit party\u2019. People are going to have to weigh up what\u2019s most important to them.\u201d In a \u201cquick-fire round\u201d to end the interview, Abbott said she would choose Bernie Sanders over Elizabeth Warren as the US Democratic party\u2019s next presidential candidate, a general election over a second referendum and Ken Livingstone over Ken Clarke. Asked to choose between Boris Johnson\u2019s aide Dominic Cummings and Tony Blair\u2019s former spin doctor Alastair Campbell, she chose Campbell. \u201cAlastair remains actually a Labour man,\u201d she said.",

      "body": "<p>The seeds of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership victory of 2015 were sown more than a decade earlier on the floor of a Labour party conference in Brighton. Then the Labour leader was Tony Blair and he had, in 2003, taken Britain into the Iraq war with predictable and disastrous consequences. By 2004, when Iraq was descending into chaos, Labour members were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/sep/27/labourconference.labour3\" title=\"\">furious</a>. Mr Blair only avoided an embarrassing defeat in Brighton that year when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/sep/30/labourconference.labour1\" title=\"\">trade union power</a> helped see off a conference motion calling for the early withdrawal of British troops from Iraq. Mr Blair won the vote, but he lost the argument with members. Mr Corbyn\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.commonspace.scot/articles/1648/odds-shorten-on-left-winger-jeremy-corbyn-becoming-next-labour-leader-following-first-tv-debate\" title=\"\">campaign</a> was built on this disaffection. Key to Mr Corbyn\u2019s appeal as Labour leader was that he promised not to let members down again.</p> <p>Yet this year Mr Corbyn is accused of doing just that over Brexit. Instead of Labour going into an election with a clear pro-remain position, something that the majority of ordinary members want, Mr Corbyn \u2013 with the backing of the big trade unions \u2013 will, it seems, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/22/labour-conference-latest-news-jeremy-corbyn-calls-for-party-to-have-two-deputy-leaders-live-news?page=with:block-5d8791d78f08f9df5bdd9491#block-5d8791d78f08f9df5bdd9491\" title=\"\">bulldozer</a> his \u201cfudge\u201d policy through. His plan seeks to persuade voters that compromise is needed to reconcile warring Brexit tribes. This is a brave and not unwelcome move in our polarised times. Mr Corbyn\u2019s policy is for a Labour government to renegotiate a Brexit deal and put it to a plebiscitary vote within six months of winning an election. There would be a special conference to determine Labour\u2019s position in that referendum. On Sunday Mr Corbyn <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/foreign-affairs/brexit/news/106726/sadiq-khan-warns-jeremy-corbyn-labour-cannot-be-%E2%80%98neutral%E2%80%99\" title=\"\">refused</a> to say how he would campaign in it. This approach recognises that the country is divided and that give and take might be required to bring people together. It allows those Labour MPs in leave constituencies to campaign in the next election as leavers, and those in remain constituencies to campaign as remainers.</p> <p>Mr Corbyn has spent his life advocating internal democracy, where the party makes policy, not the leaders. Why is he not pushing that idea now? The lesson of 2004 for trade unions who back the leadership over party members is that they can <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/bizarre-world-of-jeremy-corbyn-and-stop-the-war-coalition-galloway-rees-iraq-far-left/\" title=\"\">become</a> targets for organised attacks, laying the ground for insurgent rivals. Last year Mr Corbyn managed to ensure that there was no showdown with the membership at the party conference because shadow cabinet heavyweights Emily Thornberry and Sir Keir Starmer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2018/sep/25/labour-conference-brexit-debate-starmer-increasingly-likely-to-vote-down-mays-brexit-deal-starmer-says-politics-live\" title=\"\">backed</a> him. This year, from Brighton\u2019s seashore, they have <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/labour-party-brexit-jeremy-corbyn-emily-thornberry-keir-starmer-tom-watson-conference-2019-a9114966.html\" title=\"\">defied</a> him, saying Labour should campaign to remain. Perhaps they would not have done the same thing if the conference had been held in Blackpool, where leave won <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/27/blackpools-brexit-voters-revel-in-giving-the-metropolitan-elite-a-kicking\" title=\"\">two-thirds</a> of the 2016 vote. Nevertheless, without the support of Sir Keir or Ms Thornberry in bridging divides, Mr Corbyn could lose the membership and see his project become isolated, much like that of his old foe Mr Blair.</p> <p>Mr Corbyn\u2019s party of moral character is at risk of becoming the party of the-ends-justify-the-means. Politics at the moment in Britain is not for the faint-hearted. However, the move against Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, who is no Corbynite, was wrong and made all the wrong headlines. The resignation of Mr Corbyn\u2019s long-time <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/21/remain-mps-accuse-jeremy-corbyn-shutting-down-brexit-debate\" title=\"\">aide</a> Andrew Fisher also highlighted divisions. The Labour party is nothing if not a broad church, encompassing different traditions working with \u2013 not against \u2013 each other. In a post-industrial world everything is some kind of coalition. If not, the party is simply a religion of true believers in a multi-faith polity. Over decades, Labour activists, interests and voters have broadly agreed on a common purpose \u2013 to elect Labour governments that can redress the imbalance of economic, social and political power in Britain. That broad-church approach has served Labour well and has served Britain well too. This is still an irresistible case, even in tough times, as politics fracture, and especially in the face of Brexit\u2019s continuing disaster. Mr Corbyn needs to restore such an understanding of Labour. This conference is a chance for Mr Corbyn to do so. He should seize the opportunity.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The seeds of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership victory of 2015 were sown more than a decade earlier on the floor of a Labour party conference in Brighton. Then the Labour leader was Tony Blair and he had, in 2003, taken Britain into the Iraq war with predictable and disastrous consequences. By 2004, when Iraq was descending into chaos, Labour members were furious. Mr Blair only avoided an embarrassing defeat in Brighton that year when trade union power helped see off a conference motion calling for the early withdrawal of British troops from Iraq. Mr Blair won the vote, but he lost the argument with members. Mr Corbyn\u2019s campaign was built on this disaffection. Key to Mr Corbyn\u2019s appeal as Labour leader was that he promised not to let members down again. Yet this year Mr Corbyn is accused of doing just that over Brexit. Instead of Labour going into an election with a clear pro-remain position, something that the majority of ordinary members want, Mr Corbyn \u2013 with the backing of the big trade unions \u2013 will, it seems, bulldozer his \u201cfudge\u201d policy through. His plan seeks to persuade voters that compromise is needed to reconcile warring Brexit tribes. This is a brave and not unwelcome move in our polarised times. Mr Corbyn\u2019s policy is for a Labour government to renegotiate a Brexit deal and put it to a plebiscitary vote within six months of winning an election. There would be a special conference to determine Labour\u2019s position in that referendum. On Sunday Mr Corbyn refused to say how he would campaign in it. This approach recognises that the country is divided and that give and take might be required to bring people together. It allows those Labour MPs in leave constituencies to campaign in the next election as leavers, and those in remain constituencies to campaign as remainers. Mr Corbyn has spent his life advocating internal democracy, where the party makes policy, not the leaders. Why is he not pushing that idea now? The lesson of 2004 for trade unions who back the leadership over party members is that they can become targets for organised attacks, laying the ground for insurgent rivals. Last year Mr Corbyn managed to ensure that there was no showdown with the membership at the party conference because shadow cabinet heavyweights Emily Thornberry and Sir Keir Starmer backed him. This year, from Brighton\u2019s seashore, they have defied him, saying Labour should campaign to remain. Perhaps they would not have done the same thing if the conference had been held in Blackpool, where leave won two-thirds of the 2016 vote. Nevertheless, without the support of Sir Keir or Ms Thornberry in bridging divides, Mr Corbyn could lose the membership and see his project become isolated, much like that of his old foe Mr Blair. Mr Corbyn\u2019s party of moral character is at risk of becoming the party of the-ends-justify-the-means. Politics at the moment in Britain is not for the faint-hearted. However, the move against Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, who is no Corbynite, was wrong and made all the wrong headlines. The resignation of Mr Corbyn\u2019s long-time aide Andrew Fisher also highlighted divisions. The Labour party is nothing if not a broad church, encompassing different traditions working with \u2013 not against \u2013 each other. In a post-industrial world everything is some kind of coalition. If not, the party is simply a religion of true believers in a multi-faith polity. Over decades, Labour activists, interests and voters have broadly agreed on a common purpose \u2013 to elect Labour governments that can redress the imbalance of economic, social and political power in Britain. That broad-church approach has served Labour well and has served Britain well too. This is still an irresistible case, even in tough times, as politics fracture, and especially in the face of Brexit\u2019s continuing disaster. Mr Corbyn needs to restore such an understanding of Labour. This conference is a chance for Mr Corbyn to do so. He should seize the opportunity.",

The One Nation leader not only claimed credit for the development but launched into an unsubstantiated rant about false claims of domestic violence, that could have come from one of the darker corners of Reddit.</p> <p>It\u2019s an odd and unwelcome development at a time when we might instead be addressing the national <a href=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.sbs.com.au_news_preethi-2Dreddy-2Dviolence-2Dagainst-2Dwomen-2Dan-2Depidemic-2Din-2Daustralia&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=ptMoEJ5oTofwe4L9tBtGCQ&amp;r=ZRm2XwhewrM1EFKhCSrxP4D5f1w9AeAz1-lbHjtao38&amp;m=hbbzwFQgodpqp-SCia776TNjr36GVQe82Hdh4uwkcdQ&amp;s=rDeD5JcHT0810XGa8BnahszKH4E1I1FxdHk15cHDM9U&amp;e=\">crisis of violence</a> against women.

Even before the election Labor passed deeply flawed encryption laws; since then it has waved through Scott Morrison\u2019s tax cuts.

      "bodyText": "It was revealed last week that Pauline Hanson will be deputy-chairing a \u201cmen\u2019s rights\u201d flavoured parliamentary inquiry into the family court system. The One Nation leader not only claimed credit for the development but launched into an unsubstantiated rant about false claims of domestic violence, that could have come from one of the darker corners of Reddit. It\u2019s an odd and unwelcome development at a time when we might instead be addressing the national crisis of violence against women. But it offers an example of why Australia, unlike other comparable democracies, has not been subject to a populist rightwing breakout. The thing is, there just isn\u2019t political space for a new far-right force to really flourish in Australia. Australia\u2019s conservatives already offer enough of what the most reactionary social currents might want. Their policies tick all the right boxes \u2013 on race, gender and the environment \u2013 to an extent that leads mainstream Australian politicians, and their policies, to be praised by extremists around the world. The Coalition hand victories directly to the far right whenever it is expedient to do so, as they did on the family court inquiry. In doing so, they normalise the far right\u2019s agenda. Just as mandatory detention without hope of resettlement moved from the fringe to the centre, so too might the resentful distortions of family law which are currently the preserve of family court dads. In doing all of this, unlike in Europe and even the US, Australian conservatives encounter too little resistance inside the parliament or out. The inquiry \u2013 originally Hanson\u2019s proposal \u2013 is just the latest example. By giving her a platform to make false, sweeping, hateful claims about women undergoing difficult relationship breakdowns, the government is amply catering to the antifeminist segment of the electorate that resents the ebbing of unquestioned patriarchal authority in the home. The win also helps to legitimise the other positions of Hanson, and her incompetent and morally bankrupt party. The misogyny of men\u2019s rights campaigners is bottomless and the inquiry won\u2019t satisfy them completely. But there\u2019s enough here so that those energies won\u2019t require another outlet. All over the policy landscape, there are things that the far right can take comfort in. On immigration and refugee policy, the Australian government \u2013 indeed the bipartisan Australian political consensus \u2013 could be said to be to the right of Donald Trump, who has promoted Australia\u2019s policies on his Twitter account as something to aspire to. The fact that, unlike Trump\u2019s administration, the Coalition is generally regarded as a normal, mainstream conservative government, should be no comfort. It should be a reminder of how far things can go adrift under the guise of normalcy. The government is constantly finding new ways to signal to racists that they have their interests at heart. Peter Dutton recently described the children of a family facing deportation as \u201canchor babies\u201d as he repeated his refusal to offer them asylum. But last year he floated the possibility of creating a special visa category for white South African farmers who have been the subject of \u201cwhite genocide\u201d myth-making in News Corp papers and bio-Nazi websites alike. In his tenure as home affairs and immigration minister, Dutton has also chosen to weigh in on a moral panic about \u201cAfrican gangs\u201d in Melbourne. By very publicly demonising brown and black people, and reaching out a helping hand to South African whites, Dutton, with the tacit or explicit support of two prime ministers, has sent a very clear signal to those who want Australia white that they need look no further than the Coalition. All the while Australia\u2019s \u201cpoints-based\u201d immigration policies and its punitive refugee policies are the envy and aspiration of rightwing populists the world over. While Jair Bolsonaro attracted international condemnation for actions and inaction which led to an inferno in the Amazon, the Coalition have made policies which will ensure the destruction of another great natural wonder, off the coast of Queensland. They have relentlessly spruiked the Adani boondoggle, even as coal prices continue to slide. Matt Canavan called a company which ended its association with the mine \u201ca bunch of bedwetters\u201d and \u201cweak as piss\u201d. Earlier in the year, Barnaby Joyce repeated Scott Morrison\u2019s own gesture of bringing a lump of coal into the parliament to praise and fondle. When Pacific Island nations pressed the prime minister on climate change at the Pacific Islands Forum, his response was \u201cinsulting and condescending\u201d, and his deputy made remarks in which he said he was \u201cannoyed\u201d by the leaders of countries campaigning for their own continued survival, and that their populations could \u201cpick our fruit\u201d. For a second-tier power, Australia\u2019s government proved it could still be a first-class bully. But again, voters wanting intermittent displays of quasi-colonial chauvinism and obstinate extractive vandalism and dumb stunts to \u201cown the Libs\u201d are covered. The difference between Australia and, say, the US or the UK, is that far-right surges there have been met with outrage and resistance both inside and outside the realm of formal national politics. The Democratic party may be clumsy, and lacking in strategic unity in their response to Trump, but there can be no doubt that they are opposed to the president\u2019s agenda, from immigration to foreign affairs to trade. British politics and society, meanwhile, has been cleaved in two by the conflict over Brexit, and opponents of leaving the European Union have organised mass street demonstrations, and engaged in increasingly militant street actions. By comparison, Australia, and especially the government\u2019s official political opponents, currently seem quiescent and complacent. Labor\u2019s answer to its recent election loss appears to be a plan to track right. Even before the election Labor passed deeply flawed encryption laws; since then it has waved through Scott Morrison\u2019s tax cuts. It has reiterated its support for the basic framework of laws around asylum seekers, which prevent them settling in Australia. Queensland\u2019s Labor government has facilitated the Adani project, including stripping native title from the site. In civil society, while many activists are doing important work in resisting aspects of the government\u2019s hard-right agenda, there is not the sense of an urgent, broad political mobilisation we find in those countries where populists have taken the reins. In Australia, there has been no galvanising crisis. All of this has happened \u2013 is happening \u2013 within the range of politics-as-normal. And much of it has been normalised, even promoted, by a news media which is dominated by a company that has worked hard to shift politics right in every democracy in which it has a presence. Until Friday, Australia seems to have been sleepwalking. Has it finally woken up? Jason Wilson is a Guardian Australia columnist",

      "bodyText": "The Australian federal police dropped its investigation into whether former Liberal candidate Jessica Whelan\u2019s Facebook account was compromised after she resigned from the Liberal party and did not ask the AFP to pick up the case for her, according to documents obtained by Guardian Australia. Whelan, who was unsuccessful in her run for the Tasmanian seat of Lyons at the federal election in May, claimed Islamophobic Facebook posts under her name had been doctored. In the two posts provided to the AFP for investigation, Whelan\u2019s Facebook account comments to someone \u201cI hope you\u2019re bloody not on our housing waiting list. You shouldn\u2019t even be in Australia if you believe in ALLAH!\u201d and on another post the account allegedly commented \u201cRound them up Donald, cut their clitoris\u2019 off &amp; sell them to Muslims in Muslim countries &amp; cancel their passports. You\u2019ll make a mint\u201d. While Whelan severed ties with the Liberal party on 2 May after more social media posts emerged, she remained adamant that the two posts that were referred to the AFP were doctored, and the Liberal party referred the matter to the AFP. Documents obtained by Guardian Australia under freedom of information reveal the AFP was keen to follow up on the case but did not get a referral from Whelan after she parted ways with the Liberal party. It appears the AFP\u2019s assessment for investigation was not focused on whether the images were doctored but if Whelan\u2019s account had been hacked. The AFP informed the Liberal party, which initially asked the AFP to investigate, that police would need access to the login details of her Facebook account to check the history of logins, and IP addresses for those, to track down who might have logged into her account. The documents reveal the AFP needed Whelan to make her own referral once she split with the Liberal party, and when Whelan visited the AFP\u2019s Hobart office about the posts on 6 May and the AFP advised her she could report the matter to the AFP for investigation. The emails show the AFP was keen to keep chasing the case but had no luck getting Whelan to refer it. \u201c[We] haven\u2019t received anything, just wondering if you have heard different or if she\u2019s not going to bother referring it?\u201d one officer asks another in an email on 13 May. On 14 May, the AFP spoke to Whelan but the contents of that conversation were redacted on the grounds of the disclosure of personal information. On 30 May, the AFP changed the status of the referral to \u201cwait brief\u201d because there was no referral from Whelan. It was ultimately finalised on 17 June, \u201cpending further contact from the alleged victim, Ms Whelan\u201d. Guardian Australia understands there was no second referral from Whelan to keep and the lack of evidence outside of the two screenshots meant the AFP didn\u2019t have much to go on. Whelan told the Mercury at the end of June that she \u201chadn\u2019t heard directly from the AFP since making my report\u201d. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned I didn\u2019t make that post, an IT expert has provided me with a report stating it appeared to have been digitally manipulated,\u201d she said. \u201cI have moved on with my life.

      "body": "<p>Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president, last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/20/microsoft-boss-tech-firms-must-stop-if-its-legal-its-acceptable-approach\" title=\"\">told</a> the Guardian that tech companies should stop behaving as though everything that is not illegal is acceptable. Mr Smith made a good argument that technology may be considered morally neutral but technologists can\u2019t be. He is correct that software engineers ought to take much more seriously the moral consequences of their work.</p> <p>This argument operates on two levels: conscious and unconscious. It is easy to see the ethical issue that appeared to arise when, as a result of a series of its own confusing blog posts, Microsoft appeared to be selling facial recognition technology to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement while the Trump administration was separating children from parents at the US\u2019s southern border. This was, as Microsoft later confirmed, false. The moral stance of more than 3,000 Google employees who <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/01/technology/google-pentagon-project-maven.html\" title=\"\">protested</a> about its Maven contract \u2013 where machine learning was to be used for military purposes, starting with drone imaging \u2013 with the US Department of Defense should be applauded. Google let the contract lapse. But people with different ethical viewpoints can take different views. In the case of the Maven contract, a rival with fewer qualms <a href=\"https://www.businesstelegraph.co.uk/palmer-luckeys-anduril-won-project-maven-pentagon-ai-contract-the-intercept/\" title=\"\">picked</a> up the work. Much is contingent on public attitudes.

      "bodyText": "Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president, last week told the Guardian that tech companies should stop behaving as though everything that is not illegal is acceptable. Mr Smith made a good argument that technology may be considered morally neutral but technologists can\u2019t be. He is correct that software engineers ought to take much more seriously the moral consequences of their work. This argument operates on two levels: conscious and unconscious. It is easy to see the ethical issue that appeared to arise when, as a result of a series of its own confusing blog posts, Microsoft appeared to be selling facial recognition technology to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement while the Trump administration was separating children from parents at the US\u2019s southern border. This was, as Microsoft later confirmed, false. The moral stance of more than 3,000 Google employees who protested about its Maven contract \u2013 where machine learning was to be used for military purposes, starting with drone imaging \u2013 with the US Department of Defense should be applauded. Google let the contract lapse. But people with different ethical viewpoints can take different views. In the case of the Maven contract, a rival with fewer qualms picked up the work. Much is contingent on public attitudes. Opinion polls show that Americans are not in favour of developing artificial intelligence technology for warfare, but this changes as soon as the country\u2019s adversaries start to develop them. There is an economic aspect to be considered too. Shoshana Zuboff\u2019s insight, that the exploitation of behavioural predictions covertly derived from the surveillance of users is capitalism\u2019s latest stage, is key.

      "bodyText": "Israeli Arab political parties have broken with longstanding precedent and endorsed the ex-military chief Benny Gantz for prime minister, in a bid to prevent the incumbent, Benjamin Netanyahu, from forming the next government. The dramatic move came after the mainly Arab Joint List alliance won 13 seats in Tuesday\u2019s polls, making the bloc the third-largest force in the 120-seat parliament. In announcing the decision, Joint List leader Ayman Odeh said the alliance\u2019s decision was not an endorsement of Gantz\u2019s policies but a move to oust Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s longest-serving prime minister. It was the first time that majority Arab parties had endorsed a candidate for prime minister since 1992, when they backed Yitzhak Rabin, who went on to sign the Oslo accords with the Palestinians. Netanyahu has repeatedly been accused of political rhetoric and actions amounting to racism toward Israel\u2019s Arab population. \u201cWe have become illegitimate in Israeli politics in the Netanyahu era,\u201d Odeh told Israeli president Reuven Rivlin when informing him of the endorsement. \u201cWe are this time recommending Benny Gantz to form the next government.\u201d Prominent Arab parliament member Ahmad Tibi said \u201chistory is done: We\u2019ll do what is needed to bring down Netanyahu.\u201d But the success of the Arab parties\u2019 mission to end Netanyahu\u2019s long dominance of Israeli politics was far from certain. Rivlin, who began holding consultations with parties on Sunday to hear their recommendations on who should form the next government, said he believed both Netanyahu\u2019s rightwing Likud and Gantz\u2019s centrist Blue and White should be in the next coalition. He must designate someone to form a government after the consultations, though there has been speculation that he will bring Gantz and Netanyahu together to explore options for a unity government. Tuesday\u2019s elections ended in yet another deadlock, the second after April polls also finished inconclusively. Blue and White won the most seats, with 33 out of parliament\u2019s 120, while Likud finished second with 31. Neither has an obvious path to a majority coalition. Gantz is expected to have the endorsement of 57 seats during Rivlin\u2019s consultations, which continue on Monday. Netanyahu is expected to receive 55. Those totals do not include ex-defence minister Avigdor Lieberman\u2019s nationalist Yisrael Beitenu party, which won eight seats. Lieberman, who could potentially play a king-maker role, said on Sunday that he would not endorse either Netanyahu or Gantz for now. He has insisted on a unity government between his party, Netanyahu\u2019s rightwing Likud and Gantz\u2019s centrist Blue and White. He added that for the time being he could not back Netanyahu because the premier is willing to form a coalition with Israel\u2019s ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties, which he accuses of seeking to impose religious law on the secular population. Lieberman also said he could not back Gantz for now because he might reach a deal with either the ultra-Orthodox or Israel\u2019s Arab parties, which he called \u201cenemies\u201d. Faced with disappointing results last week, Netanyahu acknowledged he was unable to form the rightwing coalition he had hoped for and called on Gantz to join him in a unity government. But Gantz, who has also called for a unity government, made his position clear: He must be prime minister under any such arrangement, since his party has the most seats. Rivlin would \u201cmake every effort to prevent a third set of elections,\u201d Harel Tubi, director general of the president\u2019s office, told Israel\u2019s army radio on Sunday. The end of the Netanyahu era would be an extraordinary moment in Israeli politics, as he has been prime minister for a record-breaking total of more than 13 years. The 69-year-old faces potential corruption charges in the weeks ahead, pending a hearing set for early October.

      "bodyText": "Almost 800 years after Rochdale received the royal charter that made its historic market possible, traders and shoppers have expressed their dismay at the news it will soon be shut down for good. The Greater Manchester town, a trading centre since 1251, thrived for centuries as a hub for wool, cloth and cattle. But last week the local authority said the market \u2013 which is in its third location in five years \u2013 was no longer financially viable and would be closed next month. For the traders, who say they have already been moved from \u201cpillar to post\u201d, the news has been almost too much to bear. Peter Jordan\u2019s family have had a stall on the market for nearly 100 years. His grandfather Patrick, from County Mayo in Ireland, began selling produce from their farm in Rossendale in the town\u2019s market in 1919. Jordan, 76, known affectionately as \u201cThe Egg Man\u201d, had been hoping to pass on his stall to future Jordan generations. But on Monday afternoon as the stallholders were packing up for the day they were handed an official letter. It told them they were being given four weeks\u2019 notice to vacate their plots, with the last day of trading to be Monday 14 October. The council says it was not contractually obliged to give any notice but wanted to give traders time \u201cto make alternative arrangements\u201d. Jordan says: \u201cWe absolutely did not expect it. It was a total shock. We have been moved around quite a lot since the original market building closed a few years ago but we never thought they would close us for good.\u201d On Wednesday morning Jordan\u2019s stall was doing a bustling trade. The grandfather momentarily takes a seat before having to rise again to sell his prized fresh eggs or a pot plant. He believes that the market is as relevant today as it was in the 1950s when as a teenager he started helping his father. \u201cI have the same people coming every week, sometimes twice a week, to buy their eggs. They want fresh produce and don\u2019t want to get everything from supermarkets. My customers are incredibly loyal and when I do move I hope they will come with me but it doesn\u2019t make this any easier.\u201d One of those loyal customers is the roofer Carl Fleming, whose family have been buying their eggs from the Jordan family since he was a boy. \u201cIt\u2019s a real shame. I come here a couple of times a week and now I\u2019ll end up having to go to Asda which is just not the same,\u201d says the 63-year-old, who helped out on the market as a teenager cutting cauliflowers and lettuces. \u201cThey are the freshest eggs you\u2019ll ever get \u2013 he has his own hens \u2013 and they taste so good. We want to support him and other independent businesses but they just keep closing them. It is really very sad.\u201d Jordan\u2019s eggs are sold upstairs in Montague\u2019s Cafe, run by Debra McGinty, and the yolk over a helping of smashed avocado and halloumi is the colour of sunshine. McGinty says her cafe, which only opened last November in the newly refurbished former bank building, is also facing closure. Hundreds have already signed a petition to save her business and the 55-year-old is hoping the council may change its mind. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had any consultation. Nobody came to see me from the council and we\u2019re all just in shock. People love it here and the way this has all been handled has been soul destroying,\u201d she says. Council officials said traders had been kept fully informed.

The thing Liverpool really, really want is Manchester City\u2019s title. But it wouldn\u2019t hurt to take their record along the way. Liverpool have won their last 14 Premier League games, and need five more victories to beat the Premier League record set by City in 2017-18. </p> <p>A win at Stamford Bridge would be a particularly big statement of intent to win the title for the first time since 1990. If anything cost Liverpool the league last season, it was their away form against the big teams \u2013 they drew at Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester United and Everton, and were beaten at Manchester City. Not exactly \u2018Klopp out!\u2019 stuff, but it\u2019s the closest Liverpool have had to a weakness since they went to the next level with the signing of Virgil van Dijk at the start of 2018.</p> <p>Chelsea have had a mixed start to the season, with some uplifting football \u2013 especially away from home \u2013 and some shambolic defending. While they are a medium-term project for Frank Lampard, Liverpool\u2019s time is now.</p> <p>This is the start of an important period for Liverpool. Their next seven fixtures include games against Chelsea, Leicester, Manchester United and Spurs, culminating in the huge one against Manchester City at Anfield on 10 November. By then, we should have a good idea whether it really is going to happen this season.</p> <p><strong>Kick-off </strong>is at 4.30pm. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-22T14:21:05.354Z\">at 3.21pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Chelsea 1-2 Liverpool Jacob Steinberg has already filed his report from Stamford Bridge, bless him, so I\u2019ll leave you with that. Thanks for your company - goodnight. \u201cLiverpool played better at Stamford Bridge last year and drew,\u201d says Niall Mullen, \u201cso really nobody knows anything.\u201d You can\u2019t be throwing opinions like that around without the xG stats, mate. Peep peep! That\u2019s an important win for Liverpool, their first away to one of the big six for over a year. It\u2019s also their 15th consecutive league victory. That\u2019s a staggering achievement, especially as they have scored at least twice in all 15 games. They were nowhere near their best today, particularly in the second half, but they defended resolutely and rode their luck to restore their five-point lead at the top. 90+4 min Alonso is booked for taking out Robertson, who bought Liverpool some time with a brilliant 60-yard run. 90+1 min Four minutes of added time. Joe Gomez replaces Mo Salah for Liverpool, who will play 5-4-1 for the last few minutes. 90 min: Mount misses a great chance! It was a lovely move from Chelsea. Willian drove a crossfield pass to Alonso, who took it down and threaded a low pass into the area for Mount. He had to take the shot first time, as the ball bounced up, and he spanked it wide with his left foot. 90 min Liverpool can\u2019t get out. Their ball retention in second half has been abysmal. 88 min Batshuayi flicks a header just wide from Alonso\u2019s cross. It was a decent chance, 12 yards out, but there wasn\u2019t much pace on the ball and he couldn\u2019t quite guide it inside the far post. 87 min Liverpool break dangerously, with Firmino putting Salah through against the last defender. Trouble is, that last defender is N\u2019Golo Kante, and he wins the ball with ease. What a truly magnificent footballer he is. I take back that comment about a Premier League XI - Kante would walk into it, and probably a World XI too. 87 min Mount\u2019s free-kick is headed clear superbly by Matip. Liverpool have crap with the ball in this half but they have defended impeccably. 86 min Milner is booked for a foul on Zouma. 85 min Willian, Mount, Willian... Milner. 84 min Kovacic is booked for something or other, dissent I think. 84 min Another Liverpool change: Adam Lallana replaces Jordan Henderson. 83 min It\u2019s still all Chelsea, although they are struggling to get behind the Liverpool defence. 80 min Willian is fouled on the left wing by Matip. Mount\u2019s free-kick finds the offside Alonso, whose header was saved by Adrian anyway. 79 min Azpilicueta\u2019s cross is flicked well wide by Batshuayi. The ball was behind him so it was a speculative attempt. 78 min Fabinho is booked for a cynical foul on Batshuayi. 77 min Chelsea\u2019s final substitution: Tammy Abraham is replaced by Michy Batshuayi. 76 min This is turning into a good test for Liverpool, who have been weirdly poor in the last 25 minutes or so. 74 min Liverpool have switched to a 4-4-2, with Henderson on the right and Milner on the left. 73 min Alonso, who has been a constant outlet for Chelsea, comes back infield and wallops into orbit with his right foot. 72 min James Milner replaces Sadio Mane, another example of Liverpool\u2019s peculiar second-half caution. It was all his own work. He turned away from Fabinho and scurried towards the edge of the area. Then, as three Liverpool players converged, he moved the ball slightly to the right and forced a rising shot that beat the diving Adrian and flew into the top corner. That was a lovely goal. Oh my, that\u2019s a spectacular goal from N\u2019Golo Kante! 70 min Liverpool have kept Chelsea at arms length for almost all of this match. I bet Virgil van Dijk still has a resting heart rate. 69 min A dangerous break from Liverpool. Mane flights a pass over the defence to Salah, whose chest control is just too heavy, allowing the Chelsea defenders to get round and intercept. 67 min Azpilicueta\u2019s dangerous lobbed cross towards Mount is high-kicked away by Alexander-Arnold. Had that been outside the area, a foul would almost certainly have been given for dangerous play. I haven\u2019t a clue any more, I\u2019ll be honest. 67 min \u201cNot on board with playing for 2-0,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cI\u2019d rather see Liverpool pile forward in search of a 9-0 statement victory.\u201d Well, if you\u2019re going to win the league for the first time since 1989-90... 66 min Although they have had a lot of the ball in the last 15 minutes, Chelsea are not playing with much conviction. They look resigned to defeat. 65 min After a nice run from Firmino, Wijnaldum sprays high and wide from 20 yards. 63 min \u201cHas there ever been a greater concentration of the top flight\u2019s Grade A players at two clubs than just now Rob?\u201d says Gary Naylor. \u201cOr is it that the great swathes of C+ and C players (relatively speaking of course - they\u2019re all brilliant compared to us plebs) who have always populated the majority of clubs have now slid to C and C-? It\u2019s getting a bit Old Firmish isn\u2019t it?\u201d Well, it\u2019s only been that way for a year; and although it\u2019s hard to see anyone getting near the top two for the forseeable future, experience tells us something will change in the next year or two. But yes, with Hazard gone you could argue that a Premier League XI would include only players from City and Liverpool. 61 min Liverpool have started to sit on their 2-0 lead, which is unlike them. The next goal is a big one. 59 min Chelsea are having a decent spell. Azpilicueta\u2019s low cross is flicked behind his standing foot by Abraham, and it takes a touch off Matip before going behind for a corner. Chelsea appeal for handball from the corner, and then Kante rifles a low shot just wide from inside the D. 58 min \u201cThe problem with VAR as it is currently used is that it seems to be more concerned with motes than planks,\u201d says Felix Wood. \u201cEven if it\u2019s accurate, who cares about offsides by millimetres? But a keeper being five yards off his line at a penalty with three players encroaching like in the Barca-Dortmund game is missed.\u201d They should bring VAR logic to the judiciary. Stealing a penny sweet = life in the jug. Breaking into the Bank of England = a slap on the wrist. 57 min Alexander-Arnold is booked for timewasting at a throw-in. What are Liverpool doing? They are miles better than Chelsea, they should just play. 56 min Michael Oliver warns the captain Jordan Henderson about Liverpool timewasting, which in turn helps them waste a bit more time. 53 min \u201cDefine \u2018pompous\u2019,\u201d says Roger Domeneghetti. \u201cCheers!\u201d Any use of the word \u2018narrative\u2019. You\u2019re welcome! 51 min It\u2019s been all Liverpool since half-time. Kepa makes a spectacular reaction save after a rebound off Azpilicueta, although it wouldn\u2019t have counted because of an erroneous offside decision against Alexander-Arnold in the build-up. 50 min \u201cI\u2019m in Eugene, Oregon and trying to explain to an American friend what this team is to an LFC fan,\u201d says Paul Quigley. \u201cI started supporting LFC in 86 and I think this is the best team I\u2019ve ever seen from LFC. Which one of the great sides would you say is better, or is this the best?\u201d If they win the league I think they\u2019ll sit alongside the teams of 1978-79, 1983-84 and 1987-88. You could make a case for any of them really. The 1987-88 team is the best I\u2019ve seen, although the Manchester United supporter in me was a big fan of Roy Hodgson\u2019s Liverpool. 48 min Mane heads wide from Fabinho\u2019s cross. He was stretching, which meant he couldn\u2019t control the header. 47 min: Kepa makes a fine save! Chelsea a mess at set pieces. A corner on the right was headed back to Alexander-Arnold, the original taker. He boomed a cross beyond the far post to find Firmino in a scandalous amount of space. Firmino cushioned a volley back across goal, and Kepa dived to his left to push it just past the far post. That\u2019s a fine save. 46 min Peep peep! Chelsea begin the second half. \u201cAre you claiming he wasn\u2019t offside?\u201d says Mary Waltz. \u201cI just saw the replay on the US feed and he looked offside. I am open to counter arguments.\u201d No, I think Mount was just offside. But I\u2019m not certain that Son was yesterday in the Leicester-Spurs game, and that\u2019s not good enough. My main problem with VAR, apart from the fact it\u2019s turning football into reality TV, is that it was introduced at least a decade too early. It should have tested properly, so that various unforeseeable scenarios could be considered, rather than it being fasttracked so that it could make a mockery of an otherwise brilliant World Cup. \u201cDoes it matter if the tech is very slightly inaccurate?\u201d says Niall Mullen. \u201cIn the end it acts as an unimpeachable external arbiter that is less prone to error than the previous system. A bit like ball tracking on DRS. Would the ball really have clipped the top of off? Who knows but as we\u2019ve all agreed to accept its decision we\u2019re no longer arguing about it.\u201d I think it does, yeah, because once you introduce technology there\u2019s a much greater expectation of fairness. I\u2019d have a margin for error on offside, a bit like umpire\u2019s call in cricket, to cover for the imperfections in the system when it comes to establishing precisely when the ball leaves the player\u2019s foot. Half-time reading Peep peep! Liverpool are well on their way to a 15th consecutive league win. There hasn\u2019t been a huge amount between the sides, but Liverpool have just had a bit too much for Chelsea: too much nous, too much authority, too much confidence and too much class. 45+2 min Alonso\u2019s driven cross is fumbled by the diving Adrian, but he does well to grab the loose ball in front of Willian. Chelsea have had a bit of joy down their left. 45 min A chance for Abraham, who flicks a header wide from Azpilicueta\u2019s lofted cross. That was a decent opportunity, although he may have been a little unsighted. 45 min \u201cCertain VAR things are ridiculous, particularly it\u2019s negative synergy with the handball laws,\u201d says Niall Mullen. \u201cBut at least the offside for VAR is totally fair. It\u2019s objective &amp; applies equally to all.\u201d That assumes the technology is 100 per cent accurate, but it\u2019s not. 44 min The match is meandering to half-time. Chelsea will do very well to get back into this, because there\u2019s an air of fatalism around Stamford Bridge. 43 min \u201c8-0, Rob,\u201d weeps Mac Millings. \u201cIt hurts so much. Here\u2019s my all-time Sadness XI: Joe Hartbreak Despair Walker Daniel Aggerny Hankie de Jong Steve Sorrow Michael Ballachrymosity Graeme Sadness Mental disinte-Jason McAteer Cryin\u2019 Robson Diego Forlorn Stan Melancholymore.\u201d 42 min Kurt Zouma does come on to replace Christensen, who is the second Chelsea defender to go off injured in this match. 41 min Christensen is walking gingerly to the sideline. I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be able to continue. 40 min \u201cDon\u2019t be daft,\u201d says Roger Domeneghetti. \u201cMount\u2019s whole body is offside - look at the photos, not the narrative.\u201d Ach, that\u2019s such a shame \u2013 I thought we were going to get through a whole MBM without pompous use of the word \u2018narrative\u2019. 39 min Salah almost makes it 3-0, skipping easily past Tomori on the right before striking a rising shot across goal that is superbly blocked by Christensen. He\u2019s injured himself in the process, and Kurt Zouma is warming up. 37 min \u201cRob,\u201d says Matt Dony, \u201chave I told you how much I flipping love VAR?\u201d 36 min Adrian collects a cross from Jorginho and knees Abraham in the back in the process. Abraham is down and looks in a lot of pain. 33 min \u201cCan you think of a time when there was more, good outstanding English talent in the league?\u201d says Hubert O\u2019Hearn. \u201cAt least in the EPL years I can\u2019t think of a year like this when virtually every team has not just \u2018a nice young lad\u2019 but at least one and usually two players with legitimate shouts for an England call-up. Who do we credit? Better academies, or (gasp!) is the F.A. doing something right?\u201d The last time was probably in the early 2000s, when players like Gerrard, Lampard, Ferdinand, Carrick, Cole and Seth Johnson were coming through. As for why, who knows. 31 min Jorginho and Henderson square up to each other over something or other. Nothing to see here. It was a simple goal. Robertson curled over a free-kick from the left, and Firmino got in between Alonso and Christensen to head past Kepa from six yards. That was far too easy. It\u2019s there! 29 min \u201cRob, I don\u2019t suppose you could just fast forward to May and let me know if we (Liverpool) win the bloody thing,\u201d says Niall Mullen. \u201cI\u2019d quite like to just enjoy the games, it\u2019s too early in the season to be this beset by nerves.\u201d I really think you\u2019ll do it this year, injuries permitting. Mason Mount was 0.000000000000000000001 yards offside in the build up. Oh lord, it\u2019s going to be VARed. Of all the gin joints in all the world. 25 min In fact, Abraham was being played onside by Alexander-Arnold, so that would have counted. He\u2019ll feel he should have scored, though Adrian made himself big and blocked the shot with his right thigh. 24 min Adrian makes a fine save from Abraham, who was put through one-on-one by a fine pass from Christensen. I have a hunch it might have been offside had he scored, but it was a terrific save. 21 min Liverpool have this match under control, with Fabinho dictating the play in midfield. They are such an impressive side. 20 min Tomori is booked for a late tackle on Henderson. 19 min Adrian punches the corner clear and Liverpool break, only for Salah to run the ball out of play. 18 min Azpilicueta wins a corner for Chelsea, who have responded well to going behind. 15 min An early change for Chelsea, with Marcos Alonso replacing the injured Emerson. That was a brilliant goal. Salah took the free-kick, dragging his studs over the ball to move it a few yards to the side. That created just enough space for Alexander-Arnold, who smacked a curling shot across Kepa and into the far corner. It was beautifully struck. It\u2019s there! 13 min Mane is fouled in the D by Christensen. It was a clumsy, rash tackle, and this is a great chance for Liverpool. 11 min After lovely play from Kovacic, whose fast feet left Alexander-Arnold for dead, Mount\u2019s dangerous cross from the left just evades Abraham at the near post. 8 min Kante plays a nice pass down the side to Willian, who is eased to the floor by van Dijk. Nobody appealed for a penalty, even though it was a bit heavy-handed from van Dijk 7 min Liverpool are starting to dominate, with Chelsea pinned in their own half for the last few minutes. 4 min Henderson plays an imaginative long pass that would have put Mane through on goal but for a vital, last-gasp interception from the stretching Azpilicueta. 4 min Nothing to report thus far. It has, as you\u2019d expect, been a frantic start. 1 min Peep peep! Liverpool, in red, kick off from left to right. Chelsea are in blue. The players are in the tunnel. The Chelsea captain Cesar Azpilicueta, as always, is laughing and joking with the opposition. There were two early games in the Premier League, and you can read all about them here. Pre-match reading N\u2019Golo Kante plays for the first time in over a month, while Mason Mount is fit to start after suffering an ankle injury against Valencia. Chelsea (4-3-3) Kepa; Azpilicueta, Christensen, Tomori, Emerson; Kante, Jorginho, Kovacic; Willian, Abraham, Mount. Substitutes: Caballero, Zouma, Alonso, Pulisic, Barkley, Pedro, Batshuayi. Liverpool (4-3-3) Adrian; Alexander-Arnold, Matip, van Dijk, Robertson; Henderson, Fabinho, Wijnaldum; Mane, Firmino, Salah. Substitutes: Kelleher, Gomez, Milner, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Lallana, Brewster, Shaqiri. Referee Michael Oliver. Hello. The thing Liverpool really, really want is Manchester City\u2019s title. But it wouldn\u2019t hurt to take their record along the way. Liverpool have won their last 14 Premier League games, and need five more victories to beat the Premier League record set by City in 2017-18. A win at Stamford Bridge would be a particularly big statement of intent to win the title for the first time since 1990. If anything cost Liverpool the league last season, it was their away form against the big teams \u2013 they drew at Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester United and Everton, and were beaten at Manchester City. Not exactly \u2018Klopp out!\u2019 stuff, but it\u2019s the closest Liverpool have had to a weakness since they went to the next level with the signing of Virgil van Dijk at the start of 2018. Chelsea have had a mixed start to the season, with some uplifting football \u2013 especially away from home \u2013 and some shambolic defending. While they are a medium-term project for Frank Lampard, Liverpool\u2019s time is now. This is the start of an important period for Liverpool. Their next seven fixtures include games against Chelsea, Leicester, Manchester United and Spurs, culminating in the huge one against Manchester City at Anfield on 10 November. By then, we should have a good idea whether it really is going to happen this season. Kick-off is at 4.30pm.",

In 2018 Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld disappeared as a result.</p>\n    <p>In terms of habits, shoppers are switching to buying online. The likes of Amazon have an unfair advantage because they have a lower business rate bill, which holds down costs and enables online retailers to woo shoppers with low prices. Business rates are taxes, based on the value of commercial property, that are imposed on traditional retailers with physical stores.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>At the same time, there is a move away from buying \u2018stuff\u2019 as more people live in smaller homes and rent rather than buy. Those pressures have come just as rising labour and product costs, partly fuelled by Brexit, have coincided with economic and political uncertainty that has dampened consumer confidence.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What help do retailers need?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Retailers with a high-street presence want the government to change business rates. They also want more political certainty as the potential for a no deal Brexit means some are not only incurring additional costs for stockpiling goods but are unsure about the impact of tariffs after October 2019. Retailers also want more investment in town centres to help them adapt to changing trends, as well as a cut to high parking charges which they say put off shoppers.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the government doing?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In the October 2018 budget the government announced&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/26/budget-to-offer-business-rates-relief-for-small-shops\">some relief</a>&nbsp;on business rates for independent shopkeepers. It has also set up a \u00a3675m \u2018future high streets\u2019 fund under which local councils can bid for up to \u00a325m towards regeneration projects such as refurbishing local historic buildings and improving transport links. The fund will also pay for the creation of a high street taskforce to provide expertise and hands-on support to local areas.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the outlook in 2019?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Some retailers could go under. Weakened by a difficult Christmas \u2013 which accounts for the entire annual profits of many retailers, and with further Brexit wobbles to come \u2013 retailers are facing a tough 2019.

      "bodyText": "The UK chancellor is being urged to ease the burden of business rates after new figures suggested councils are sending bailiffs to 310 companies a day over arrears. English councils sent bailiffs to more than 69,000 companies that have struggled to pay their business rates in the year to the end of March, according to responses to a series of freedom of information requests made by the property consultancy Altus. The firm estimates the figures equate to around one in 16 of all business premises facing the prospect of having their goods seized by bailiffs last year. The numbers come a month after 50 retailers \u2013 including Marks &amp; Spencer, Harrods and Iceland \u2013 wrote to the chancellor Sajid Javid, demanding action on the business rates burden to safeguard the future of the high street. Firms across England could see their rates increase by a total \u00a3536m for 2020-21, if the headline rate of inflation of 1.7% remains unchanged in September, according to Altus. Retailers will shoulder \u00a3137m of that hike. Robert Hayton, head of UK business rates at Altus, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not the mechanics of the rating system that is of primary concern of business but the level of the actual rates bills.\u201d \u201cCommercial property is already making a significant contribution to overall UK tax revenues. With the highest property taxes across the EU, the chancellor should recognise this in his upcoming autumn budget by removing the automatic inflationary increase.\u201d Business rates \u2013 the commercial equivalent of council tax, based on a property\u2019s value \u2013 have become a totemic issue for retailers struggling with the impact of economic uncertainty and competition from digital services. They point to the comparatively lower business rate burdens for online-only players such as Amazon, who pay rates on their warehouses but do not have a significant high street presence. Altus received details on how many business premises were referred to bailiffs from 264 English councils covering 1.7m properties out of 1.9m liable for rates. The responses, which cover nearly 90% of all non-domestic properties, show a total of 69,367 instructions to bailiffs were made \u2013 representing 4% of all commercial premises in England. The Altus research discovered that Birmingham city council referred the most premises to bailiffs over the year, at 3,755 \u2013 or nearly 8% of business premises in its area.

      "bodyText": "Thomas Cook customers in Tunisia have been involved in a standoff with a hotel owner who barricaded holidaymakers inside a resort due to fears that the struggling holiday firm would not be able to pay bills. Guests at the Orangers hotel in the coastal town of Hammamet spoke of being locked inside their resort on Saturday until a 6,000 Tunisian dinar (\u00a31,680) fee was paid before they were allowed to leave for their flight, or even to visit a shop. Those buses that arrived to transport holidaymakers to the airport at Enfidha were turned away by security, Orangers guests told the Guardian. Thomas Cook customers Maddie Clamp, 26, and her boyfriend, Shaun Holmes, 30, from Derby described how they had been locked within their holiday complex as management, apparently wrong-footed by the news of the travel giant\u2019s financial troubles, tried to secure payment from their guests. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t even let us out of the hotel,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cThe Thomas Cook rep said he\u2019d contacted the chief of police [about their situation].\u201d However, by Sunday the standoff had been resolved and guests were allowed to leave. Holidaymakers said a local representative from Thomas Cook had worked late into the night before returning on Sunday morning to again deal with guests\u2019 urgent queries. The company said on Sunday any guests who had paid the hotel had been refunded. \u201cWe are aware that a small number of customers were asked to pay for their hotel room before leaving Les Orangers in Tunisia [on Saturday]. This has now been resolved and customers flew home as planned. We continue to support our customers in all our resorts,\u201d said a Thomas Cook spokesperson. Lynn and Peter Taylor from Newcastle, who had travelled to Tunisia with Thomas Cook, said guests leaving the hotel had been asked for extra payment. \u201cThose who were due to leave today had letters slipped under their door,\u201d said Lynn Taylor. \u201cThe hotel was asking for 6,000 TD. I think one old lady paid it. We\u2019re not.\u201d The hotel declined to comment or provide any details of communication between the hotel and Thomas Cook, speaking only to confirm that guests were now free to enter and leave the hotel. Tourism in Tunisia continues to recover from two devastating terror attacks that all but destroyed the industry in 2015, including the mass killing of predominantly British tourists at the Hotel Rui Imperial Marhaba near Souse. Tourism from the UK, a very lucrative line for Tunisia\u2019s struggling economy, was particularly badly hit, with a government travel warning in place over visiting the North African country running from June 2015 until July 2017. Thomas Cook had been among the first to return to Tunisia, announcing the resumption of flights in February 2018. The British consulate in Tunis said it was aware of the situation and providing what assistance it could.",

Then he decided to go it alone, and set up his own firm, Woodford Investment Management, in 2014.</p>\n    <p><b>Why has he shut his main fund?<br></b>The Woodford Equity Income Fund is Woodford\u2019s flagship fund, and it is understood it has several hundred thousand investors. On 3 June he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/jun/03/neil-woodford-blocks-investors-from-pulling-cash-from-flagship-fund\">blocked investors from pulling their cash out of the fund</a> after a dramatic jump in customer withdrawals after its performance went south following a series of bad stock market bets. The move gives him time to restructure the fund\u2019s portfolio and sell off some assets in order to raise cash to meet the likely flood of redemptions when the fund does eventually reopen. On 1 July Woodford announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/01/block-on-withdrawals-from-neil-woodford-fund-extended\">the fund will remain suspended</a> until \u2013 at the earliest \u2013 the next review deadline of 29 July.</p>\n    <p><b>What does it mean for investors?<br></b>Put simply, they are blocked from accessing their investments until further notice. Existing investors will continue to own units in the fund, and they are being reassured that their money is safe. But there\u2019s no certainty about what their investment will be worth. While the official position is that no exceptions are being made, if you are facing a real crisis and badly need your cash, it is probably worth giving the firm a try to see if they might budge for you.</p>\n    <p><b>When will the fund open again?<br></b>Most commentators seem to expect the fund to effectively stay shut for some time to come. Woodford will need to build up a big pot of cash ready to meet redemptions when the fund reopens \u2013 easily several hundred million pounds.

He had left school wanting to fly fighter jets but couldn\u2019t pass the RAF\u2019s aptitude test, and instead read economics and agricultural economics at the University of Exeter.</p>\n    <p>Feeling he had outgrown Invesco Perpetual, he set up his own firm Woodford Investment Management in 2014, on an industrial estate near Oxford. Within two weeks of launching, he had raised \u00a31.6bn, a UK record, and it quickly grew to \u00a316bn. In its first full year his flagship fund returned 16% and Woodford, a devotee of veteran US investor Warren Buffett, was dubbed the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-27/oracle-of-oxford-sees-red-as-stock-picking-powers-misfire\">\u201cOracle of Oxford\u201d</a>.</p>\n    <p>Asked if he ever doubted his judgment, Woodford once said: \u201cDaily. You must never, as a fund manager, stick your head in the sand saying \u2018everybody go away, I\u2019m right, I\u2019m right, I\u2019m right\u2019. You\u2019ve always got to expose yourself to criticism and the analysis that you may be wrong.\u201d</p>\n    <p>Woodford went on to say that the secret of successful fund management was a balance of arrogance and humility. \u201cYou have to have a sufficiently strong arrogant gene to back your judgment, back your conviction. If you didn\u2019t, you would end up with a portfolio that looks very much like the index. But, equally, you must have the humility to accept that you will get things wrong.\u201d</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rupertneate\"><b>Rupert Neate</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>However, the note to Morgan also stated that Woodford Investment Management had failed to follow through on a promise to inform Hargreaves Lansdown if more than 10% of the Equity Income fund was ever invested in unquoted companies.</p> \n<p>Hill wrote: \u201cWe insisted that they abide by \u2026 guidelines not to breach the 10% level and to inform us immediately if they did, to which they also agreed.

      "bodyText": "The billionaire founder of the UK\u2019s largest retail investment platform has attacked the beleaguered fund manager Neil Woodford for appearing not to be \u201ctruthful\u201d about the performance of his frozen investment fund. Peter Hargreaves \u2013 who with Stephen Lansdown founded the Hargreaves Lansdown share-dealing service for private investors in 1981 \u2013 added that the firm\u2019s clients had been \u201cstuffed into this horrible Woodford fund\u201d. The FTSE 100 company has come under fire for using its Wealth 50 list of recommended funds to promote Woodford\u2019s Equity Income fund, which blocked investors from withdrawing their cash in June after becoming overwhelmed by customer withdrawals following a series of bad market bets. Hargreaves, 72, told the Sunday Times: \u201cIt\u2019s annoyed the hell out of me that it would appear he [Woodford] has not been truthful with Hargreaves Lansdown. But it\u2019s also annoyed me that they [Hargreaves Lansdown] let it go on so long.\u201d Hargreaves Lansdown has previously said it was aware of the fund\u2019s underperformance but kept it on its recommended Wealth 50 list in the hope it would bounce back. Woodford became one of the UK\u2019s most feted fund managers after his initially contrarian bets against technology and banking stocks paid off following the dotcom crash and the banking crisis. Hargreaves \u2013 who stepped down as chief executive of the company he founded in 2010, and remained on the board until 2015 \u2013 has also been criticised over the affair after he banked a \u00a364m dividend from his 32% stake in the company in August. His total stake is worth just over \u00a33bn. He told the Sunday Times: \u201cThe clients have been stuffed in this horrible Woodford fund. I\u2019ve drawn this big dividend. Nothing to do with me and I\u2019ve been very successful. What do they want me to do? Give the dividend back to the unit holders?\u201d In a June letter addressed to Nicky Morgan, the then chair of parliament\u2019s Treasury select committee, the Hargreaves Lansdown chief executive, Chris Hill, said the platform conducts \u201cextremely rigorous\u201d checks on funds before including them in its Wealth 50 list, including analysis of fund manager performance and \u201cface to face meetings\u201d. However, the note to Morgan also stated that Woodford Investment Management had failed to follow through on a promise to inform Hargreaves Lansdown if more than 10% of the Equity Income fund was ever invested in unquoted companies. Hill wrote: \u201cWe insisted that they abide by \u2026 guidelines not to breach the 10% level and to inform us immediately if they did, to which they also agreed. We have subsequently, on 18 June 2019 in FCA chair Andrew Bailey\u2019s response to the Treasury select committee, found out that Woodford twice breached this limit in February and March 2018. They did not inform us of this on either occasion.\u201d Woodford has said that the agreement was to disclose \u201cmonth-end breaches only\u201d. Last month, Hargreaves Lansdown said it will lose more than \u00a32m in revenues after waiving fees for nearly 300,000 customers locked into Woodford\u2019s suspended flagship fund. The gating of the fund has left \u00a31.6bn of Hargreaves\u2019 client investments trapped for months, and withdrawals are likely to remain in place until at least December. Hargreaves Lansdown and Woodford Investment Management declined to comment.",

      "bodyText": "The Australia wing Reece Hodge may miss the rest of the World Cup after he was cited for his controversial tackle on Fiji\u2019s Peceli Yato. He will face a disciplinary hearing in Tokyo this week and, if found guilty, he can expect a ban that would jeopardise the rest of his tournament. Hodge went unpunished after the incident in the 25th minute but Yato, who had made a superb start to the match, was replaced after failing a head injury assessment. Fiji were privately furious that the referee, Ben O\u2019Keeffe, did not take further action or consider awarding a penalty and asked for the incident to be reviewed by the citing commissioner. To compound matters for Fiji, who were leading 11-8 at the time of the incident, Hodge proceeded to score Australia\u2019s next try. World Rugby\u2019s disciplinary guidelines state that sanctions for dangerous tackles which involve contact with the head start at a six-week suspension before mitigating factors are taken into account. Australia\u2019s next match is against Wales on 29 September but, if Hodge does receive a six-week ban, he would be ruled out of the Wallabies\u2019 next six matches, thereby ending his tournament. Under World Cup rules players who receive suspensions cannot be replaced. Hodge\u2019s citing will be of little consolation to Fiji, who will be without Yato for their match against Uruguay on Wednesday as he does not have enough time to undergo the HIA return-to-play protocols.

Vunipola was not having that. \u201cI am who I am,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m proud to represent England, I\u2019ve worked my whole life to be where I am right now and it\u2019s not something I\u2019d turn my back on. It\u2019s just that I know who I am and where I come from.\u201d Kapeli\u2019s been on a journey of his own. He is 26, just like Vunipola. But while Billy went off to become a superstar in England, he has been playing rugby league for the Waiheke Rams and working as an apprentice builder in Canterbury. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen many people do that to Billy before,\u201d I told him when we were talking after the game. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, \u201cbut then I haven\u2019t played a lot of footy in the UK.\u201d",

The CQC has noticed a steady improvement in services throughout the hospital and has rated over half the areas it inspected \u2013 including paediatrics \u2013 as \u2018good\u2019.\u201d</p> \n<p>She is pinning her hopes on Barts health NHS trust, which runs Whipps Cross, getting the \u00a3350m needed to replace it with a facility fit for the 21st century. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, and the Chingford and Woodford Green MP, Iain Duncan Smith, are both behind the plan. Trust chiefs used Johnson\u2019s visit to draw his attention to it, too.</p> \n<p>Until a decision is made, Whipps Cross and its staff will carry on, as pressure on it and the wider NHS continues to rise. One consultant said: \u201cI fell in love with Whipps Cross when I trained there. It\u2019s got the most incredibly caring people. But I\u2019ve watched it suffer for a lack of ongoing resources since austerity kicked in.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s the sheer bloody-mindedness and pure blood, sweat and tears of the staff that mean a building that is over a century old can yield good modern-day outcomes. But with each passing financial year, people\u2019s goodwill tanks run drier.\u201d</p>",

There is an atmosphere of openness and support across and between departments that does not exist in every hospital. \u201cThere have been serious [patient safety] incidents here during my time, and I have found the culture to be one related to learning and improvement, not cover-up or silencing.\u201d While this combination of relentless frontline pressures and staff going the extra mile to hold things together may seem contradictory, it is also a microcosm of the reality in many \u2013 possibly most \u2013 NHS hospitals. Cunningham said: \u201cThe reality is that Whipps is not exceptional in its failings. The challenges of too many patients and too few beds are widespread across the NHS.\u201d The Care Quality Commission (CQC) found the same mixed picture when it last reported on the hospital in the spring. It found \u201csubstantial waiting lists for clinic appointments \u2026 challenges with staffing in some of the services we inspected \u2026 pockets of bullying in the emergency department. The A&amp;E had high nursing and consultant vacancy rates.\u201d But inspectors also noted \u201cimproved referral to treatment waiting times [for planned operations] \u2026 [and] significantly improved standards of care, dignity and privacy in medical care, improved medicines management [and] improved record-keeping in surgery\u201d. Dr Heather Noble, the hospital\u2019s medical director, is candid about the challenges. \u201cLike any NHS hospital, we have our share of operational ups and downs.\u201d But, she added, \u201coverall the quality of care for patients has been transformed in recent years. The CQC has noticed a steady improvement in services throughout the hospital and has rated over half the areas it inspected \u2013 including paediatrics \u2013 as \u2018good\u2019.\u201d She is pinning her hopes on Barts health NHS trust, which runs Whipps Cross, getting the \u00a3350m needed to replace it with a facility fit for the 21st century. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, and the Chingford and Woodford Green MP, Iain Duncan Smith, are both behind the plan. Trust chiefs used Johnson\u2019s visit to draw his attention to it, too. Until a decision is made, Whipps Cross and its staff will carry on, as pressure on it and the wider NHS continues to rise. One consultant said: \u201cI fell in love with Whipps Cross when I trained there. It\u2019s got the most incredibly caring people. But I\u2019ve watched it suffer for a lack of ongoing resources since austerity kicked in. \u201cIt\u2019s the sheer bloody-mindedness and pure blood, sweat and tears of the staff that mean a building that is over a century old can yield good modern-day outcomes. But with each passing financial year, people\u2019s goodwill tanks run drier.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of Egyptians have been swept up in a campaign of arrests targeting protesters, as demonstrations against Abdel-Fatah al-Sisi\u2019s rule continue. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF), a Cairo-based NGO, reported on Sunday that at least 220 people had been arrested since protests began on Friday night. The organisation said it had set up an \u201cemergency room\u201d to deal with the spike in arrests, and that at least 100 more people were likely to have been detained after protests in Suez, Alexandria and Giza. Another NGO, the Egyptian Centre for Economic &amp; Social Rights, stated it had recorded at least 274 arrests since the demonstrations began. \u201cWe\u2019re continuing to get cases around the clock,\u201d said Mohamed Lotfy of ECRF. \u201cI think the riot police and the ministry of the interior didn\u2019t expect this size of protests.\u201d ECRF recorded arrests in at least 12 locations, including Cairo, Giza, Alexandria, Suez, and towns such as Dakahlia, Qalyubia and Kafr el-Sheikh. On Friday protesters had taken to the streets across Egypt for the first time in years, in defiance of a de facto six-year ban on demonstrations. Those who came out to call openly for an end to Sisi\u2019s rule risked immediate arrest as well as the use of teargas, rubber bullets and live rounds. \u201cThe Friday protest was such a shock to me because people were not able to voice any of their anger. So this was a sign of hope that people still have a voice, they\u2019re not dead. I feel encouraged to protest next Friday, the same as many others,\u201d said 32-year-old Hafsa, a teacher who protested in Cairo\u2019s el-Matareya district on Friday. \u201cNow in Matareya, there\u2019s a heavy police presence with riot police at the entrance to all main streets. There are also plainclothes policemen who search people at random. 24/7 there are mobile patrols roaming the streets to intimidate people,\u201d she said. Riot police and security forces surrounded Cairo\u2019s Tahrir Square on Saturday evening, to prevent potential demonstrators accessing the symbolic site. But in the north-eastern city of Suez, crowds of protesters chanted against the president before being broken up by a wave of teargas, live rounds and arrests. Arrest data shows that protesters were either too young to fully partake in the 2011 uprising that overthrew Hosni Mubarak, or are part of an older generation less accustomed to demonstrations. \u201cIt\u2019s the average Egyptian who has never protested in the past, perhaps they joined the millions in Tahrir when they were younger,\u201d said Lotfy. \u201cBut if you look at the list, many are in their 20s. This feels like a new generation of protesters.\u201d Those documenting events were also targeted for arrest. A man named Mohamed Saied who filmed protests in Suez and posted footage to social media recorded an emotional message Saturday night. \u201cThe police are downstairs from my building, they\u2019re coming to arrest me,\u201d he says. \u201cAll I did was film.\u201d The number of arrests in Cairo on Saturday overwhelmed the capacity of all nearby police stations, with detainees being housed in a barracks meant for Egypt\u2019s central security forces. From there, detainees are taken in groups for questioning by the police as well as Egypt\u2019s national security agency, both known for their use of \u201csystematic, widespread enforced disappearances and torture that most likely amount to crimes against humanity\u201d, according to Human Rights Watch. But there has been little official response to the protests. Egypt\u2019s State Information Service released a statement targeting Cairo-based international journalists on Saturday evening, warning them to \u201cabide by internationally recognised professional standards\u201d, in covering the protests. \u201cMany world capitals witness daily incidents without anyone jumping to conclusions or exaggerations that are usually not even remotely close to the truth,\u201d it said. The presidential spokesman Bassam Rady was not reachable when contacted by the Guardian. The call for this weekend\u2019s protests came from Mohamed Ali, a former military contractor and actor who released a string of videos accusing Sisi and the military of high-level corruption. His accusations were previously dismissed as \u201clies and slander\u201d, by the Egyptian leader. Ali has since called for a \u201cmillion-man\u201d march this Friday. Protests looked set to continue with Sisi on a trip to New York where he was due to give a speech on \u201cpreserving world peace and security as well as fighting terrorism\u201d at the UN general assembly. His absence underlines a dilemma facing Egyptian security forces at home, who are under pressure to contain demonstrators without using excessive force. \u201cProtests are likely to continue if the government failed to devise an appropriate \u2018political\u2019 response.

A baby-faced teenager Mason Greenwood, who does not turn 18 until next month, proved the hero for United in midweek, while West Ham are feeling fresh as a daisy, unbeaten since an opening day humbling at Manchester City. \u201cManchester United played on Thursday night [in victory over Astana in the Europa League] but they changed nine players so it will be a different team,\u201d said Manuel Pellegrini. \u201cWe are in a good moment so, if we are playing against the big teams, we must show we can play in the same way.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r, too, is feeling upbeat. \u201cWe feel we are on the right track and, if we keep it up, I believe we will be challenging for the top four at the end of the season,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is wide open at the moment.\u201d For West Ham, who won this fixture in April, this represents a fine chance to stamp their authority.</p> <p><strong>Kick-off:</strong> 2pm (BST)</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-22T11:57:12.203Z\">at 12.57pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Thanks for your company. Bye! Before you go, do join Rob Smyth for the big one at the Bridge: Elsewhere? Wolves found a late equaliser at Palace: Get a load of David Hytner\u2019s verdict from the London Stadium: More deadpan brilliance from Mourinho. Any positives? \u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t find. We were bad last season but I don\u2019t see any improvement, even with three new players, players with a positive impact. I like the three, I think they are bringing some good quality to the team but the team as a team, I don\u2019t like at all. I\u2019m not surprised by the result and I don\u2019t think Ole can take any positives from the game.\u201d You want Roy Keane\u2019s reaction? Here it goes. \u201cI knew they weren\u2019t in a great place but I\u2019m shocked and saddened how bad they were,\u201d Keane says. \u201cEverything about United; lacklustre, lack of quality, lack of desire, leaders, characters it\u2019s a long way back for United but it\u2019s scary how far they have fallen.\u201d West Ham\u2019s performance will inevitably be overlooked by Manchester United\u2019s woes, but Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s side, who rise to fourth \u2013 for a couple of hours, at least \u2013 were impressive without doing anything too spectacular. Andriy Yarmolenko not only opened the scoring with a wonderful strike but made a superb block to prevent Jesse Lingard\u2019s shot from troubling Lukasz Fabianski. \u201cIt gives us belief we can compete with the top, top teams,\u201d says a chirpy Mark Noble. \u201cWith the squad we\u2019ve got, the feel-good factor, we can compete with the best. Three clean sheets in a row is very impressive.\u201d The inquest continues. Dire, drab, dreadful stuff from Manchester United, another insipid performance to go with the rest of them of late. By the end, West Ham, who scored through Andriy Yarmolenko and Aaron Cresswell, were coasting. Another winless away day \u2013 they have not won on the road in the league since February \u2013 an injury to Marcus Rashford compounded a miserable afternoon in the capital. Where does Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, arms folded at the final whistle, go from here? 90+2 min: The away end is hastily emptying. 90 min: A high Aaron Wan-Bissaka cross flies straight out of play for a goal-kick. That sums things up. There will be four added minutes for Manchester United to prevent West Ham from inflicting an embarrassing third. 89 min: Robert Snodgrass replaces Yarmolenko, who has been brilliant. Not only did he open the scoring with a fine finish, he has done the dirty work too. Without wanting to repeat it time and again, Manchester United have been nothing short of dreadful. West Ham have brushed them aside oh so easily. 87 min: Daniel James slams an effort against the side netting! Fred slips the winger through and James speeds beyond Ogbonna as though he\u2019s not there. He does well, travelling 25-odd yards before getting a shot away. But it ends up nestling the wrong side of Lukasz Fabianski\u2019s goal. James has been United\u2019s only bright spark going forward. They have offered next to nothing up front. 86 min: Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r looks concerned. Very concerned. Aaron Cresswell\u2019s marvellous free-kick bends into the top corner. His left-footed strike is sweet and it curls towards the proverbial postage stamp of David de Gea\u2019s goal. The Manchester United goalkeeper did get a left hand to it but he could not claw the ball away nor prevent it from rippling the net. That\u2019s game, set and match for West Ham. Manchester United have been dire. Again. 82 min: Manchester United are slipping and sliding, trying to get to grips with West Ham, who have poured bodies forward and Ashley Young makes a crude challenge on Mark Noble, who wins the foul. Twenty-five yards from goal, it is similar to the position a moment ago. Cresswell will take it once more. 81 min: Angel Gomes is on for Mata. The final roll of the dice. 80 min: Pablo Zabaleta replaces Ryan Fredericks. 77 min: Cresswell takes it \u2013 and it is a thumping effort \u2013 but it is always rising. Now, can Manchester United assert themselves on this game? They cannot play much worse. 76 min: Fred\u2019s first notable contribution? To foul fellow substitute Jack Wilshere, 25 yards from goal. A clumsy challenge by the Brazilian, who got the wrong side of the midfielder, who did well, driving forward, clinging hold of the ball. Yarmolenko, the goalscorer, and Aaron Cresswell both fancy it ... 74 min: Mark Noble is booked for a late lunge on Wan-Bissaka. Anthony Taylor is quick to award a yellow card and the video assistant referee does check it \u2013 it was a meaty challenge \u2013 but there\u2019s nothing doing. Taylor waves play on. \u201cYet again Mark Noble escapes a straight red v United,\u201d emails Duncan. \u201cWhat\u2019s he got to do to be sent off?\u201d It was a very poor challenge, that\u2019s for sure. 72 min: The Manchester United bench is, it is fair to say, decidedly light on quality. When Fred, who made his first start of the season against Astana, is the saviour, it says a lot about the problems. \u201cI think the telling thing about the 11 Man United players on the field is that, of the 20 outfield players on the field, I think the top five players are West Ham players,\u201d emails Joseph Harvey. \u201cThe top two or three aren\u2019t even close, honestly.\u201d The best player on the pitch at the London Stadium this afternoon? Andriy Yarmolenko, perhaps? Felipe Anderson was very good without doing anything extraordinary. 71 min: The lesser-spotted Fred replaces Matic. 70 min: Jack Wilshere replaces Felipe Anderson. 68 min: Huge chance goes begging for Maguire \u2013 but that is a massive save by Fabianski! Harry Maguire recycles the debris of an Ashley Young corner, having nodded a header into McTominay\u2019s path. The United midfielder holds off Diop to stab it back into Maguire, who hammers an effort at goal but Fabianski gets down low to prevent Manchester United from finding an equaliser. 65 min: \u201cMan United are lacking strikers, why did they leave Greenwood out of the squad?\u201d emails Lukudu Alison. A gentle reminder that the 17-year-old apparently has a bout of tonsillitis, hence his absence at the London Stadium, four days after scoring the winner for Manchester United against Astana. 63 min: Up in the director\u2019s box, Ed Woodward, sat in front of Lee Grant and Phil Jones, looks a combination of exasperated and hacked off as another Manchester United move breaks down, with James sending a cross crashing out of play. 62 min: De Gea saves from Felipe Anderson! A close shave for Manchester United, who allow Yarmolenko to slide in the Brazilian. Anderson winds up a powerful shot from the angle and De Gea keeps it out with his legs. Smart stop. 61 min: Lingard replaces Rashford. The Manchester United injury list mounts, with Rashford joining the sidelined Pogba, Martial, Greenwood, Shaw and Bailly. 58 min: Marcus Rashford is down and requires attention. Rashford pulled up with no one around him and he\u2019s shaking his head. That says it all. Jesse Lingard is being readied down on the Manchester United bench. Rashford looks upset, very distressed. That injury compounds things for Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, who wraps his arm around Rashford, as the striker trudges off down the tunnel. 57 min: Scott McTominay \u2013 just about \u2013 manages to get a shot away! But it is from an acute angle and no problem for Lukasz Fabianski to collect. It was a well-worked move, with Pereira sliding a neat reverse ball in for the midfielder, who jinked his way through to the byline but getting any kind of power on the strike was always going to be a tall order. Down on the touchline, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r is barking away about something. That was a half-decent move. 55 min: Felipe Anderson comes alive down the left wing \u2013 but Wan-Bissaka is alert to it and goes to ground \u2013 of course he does \u2013 to intervene. West Ham almost prosper from the resulting corner, with Anderson rolling the ball into Cresswell but Rashford steals the ball away. 51 min: It is bucketing it down at the London Stadium, where Ogbonna is back on after taking a knock from a collision with Dan James a moment ago. From the resulting throw-in, James dinks an inviting \u2013 but fairly flat \u2013 ball into the box but Fabianski comfortably gathers. Manchester United\u2019s intentions this second half have eclipsed anything they mustered up in a dreadful first. 48 min: Mata! Just wide! Pereira zooms down the fight flank and powers a cross across goal but the Spaniard cannot divert it goalwards at the back post. It was not for the want of trying. McTominay did well to skip past Cresswell, to lay the ball on for Pereira out wide but his cross has too much weight on it for Mata to steer it in with his left foot. A frustrating afternoon continues. 47 min: Rashford leads from the front and Daniel James almost wriggles his way through Issa Diop and Angelo Ogbonna but West Ham survive. Yarmolenko puts a foot on it to calm things down before Declan Rice is caught by Juan Mata, who has had what they call a stinker. Mata is booked for his efforts. 46 min: West Ham get the second half started. No changes. So, Roy Keane is close to imploding at Mark Noble being allowed nine touches in the buildup to that fine Andriy Yarmolenko strike, his second of the season. Asked what was missing from that first-half Manchester United display Jos\u00e9 Mourinho replies, deadpan: \u201cIn this moment, I think they are missing everything. It looks to me a sad game, it looks to me a game of \u2018Let\u2019s see what is going to happen.\u2019 Sometimes players are a bit confused and it\u2019s difficult for them to understand.\u201d Work to do for Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r. Roy Keane is about to crucify Manchester United. Stay tuned. It had been coming. Noble and Felipe Anderson are involved in the buildup and then the latter, first time, coolly rolls the ball into the path of Yarmolenko, who wraps his left foot around the ball and arrows it into the far corner beyond David de Gea. It\u2019s this game\u2019s first moment of real quality. Manchester United\u2019s defending was slack at best, drifting around the box, chasing shadows before Yarmolenko hammered in. Ashley Young, in fairness, had flung himself in front of a couple of crosses from the right moments earlier but few of his team-mates followed suit. 41 min: And now Ashley Young keeps an overlapping Ryan Fredericks at bay. Manchester United have been really poor. 39 min: Dan James does brilliantly to sniff out the danger, as Felipe Anderson laid the ball on for Mark Noble. Just as Noble was about to take aim, James nipped in to take the ball off his feet and the former ends up chopping down the winger inside the United box. United were lethargic there, as West Ham patiently shifted the ball around the 18-yard area in search of the perfect opening. 37 min: Right on cue, Rashford races to try and charge down a long Fabianski kick upfield, which Haller rises highest for. Victor Lindel\u00f6f is lured in to try and win it and concedes a foul. West Ham will try to build on a decent period of pressure. 36 min: Rashford seems to be blowing. He\u2019s been a peripheral figure so far and, more than anything, the United striker simply looks a bit knackered. 34 min: Wan-Bissaka makes a wholehearted challenge on Pablo Fornals. It was a no-nonsense \u2013 and much-needed \u2013 tackle by the full-back. But the visitors are back under the cosh as West Ham win a free-kick, with Mark Noble teed up on the edge of the box. He stabs a volley at goal but it does not have anywhere near the kind of venom needed to trouble David de Gea. Still, it\u2019s a shot on target. 32 min: Pereira smacks the ball at goal and Manchester United do at least win a corner, with a hopeful strike deflecting out of play. It comes to nothing but it was an encouraging passage of play, which stemmed from Maguire and Victor Lindel\u00f6f in defence before Pereira took over the baton on halfway. United have struggled to maintain any sort of tempo but they came alive momentarily. 28 min: It evades everyone and thuds out of play for a West Ham goal-kick. Young slaps his thighs in frustration, adamant his team-mates could have made a bigger attempt to reach his cross. 27 min: Diop is penalised for a clumsy foul on Dan James. The winger\u2019s pace is an out ball Manchester United are yet to truly make the most of. Young will swing it in from the left with his right foot, 40-odd yards from goal ... 25 min: Yarmolenko turns Matic at the byline before a hammering a low ball across goal. United hack it away, as Wan-Bissaka makes a mess of a headed clearance. Back come West Ham, with Ashley Young eventually getting rid. 23 min: Scott McTominay thumps a cross across goal \u2013 that one is way too heavy for Rashford or anyone else to get on the end of. This is probably Manchester United\u2019s best spell of the game so far, though. Meanwhile, Wan-Bissaka and Ashley Young have swapped flanks, with the former moving to left-back. 20 min: Up the other end, Issa Diop heads clear a wonderful Wan-Bissaka cross. It was on a plate for Rashford, who had been played through on goal a few moments earlier before getting in a tangle. Rashford never really made a play to attack the cross and Diop had to intervene to avert the danger. He did well. As for Rashford, he does seem to be playing like a player a low on confidence. 19 min: Yarmolenko curls an effort at goal \u2013 but it is relatively tame and David de Gea comfortably gathers. It stemmed from a high ball upfield to Haller, who got the better of Maguire. Fornals fed off the scraps and released Felipe Anderson out wide, who cut inside before unselfishly laying the ball off for Yarmolenko but the winger\u2019s first-time effort lacked the conviction to beat De Gea. 18 min: Ah, Ashley Young\u2019s corner evades everyone. 17 min: Mata dinks a ball in behind Fredericks and Dan James is off to chase. Great ball, good run ... and Manchester United have a corner. 16 min: Cresswell zooms down the left but Aaron Wan-Bissaka is there every step of the way. Eventually, the Manchester United full-back goes to ground to halt the West Ham left-back. The hosts get the throw-in but then the offside flag goes up. Another move breaks down. That\u2019s sloppy on their part. 15 min: Nemanja Matic winds one up and powers an effort straight at Lukasz Fabianski from 25 yards out. Manchester United\u2019s buildup play was a little bit slicker then but it has largely been pedestrian, other than Pereira racing down the right a moment ago. Rashford and James have been anonymous. 13 min: After a long lull, Angelo Ogbonna commits to make a rash challenge on Pereira, who knocked the ball beyond the West Ham defender down the flank. Ogbonna goes into the book. He had little choice. West Ham had been knocking the ball about nicely but then cheaply surrendered possession and Ogbonna dived in to try and win it back to no avail. That\u2019s about as exciting as things have got for Manchester United. They have been very flat. 8 min: Aaron Cresswell does well to brush off Aaron Wan-Bissaka down the West Ham left, moments after being adjudged to have fouled Pereira, when it seemed as though the Manchester United midfielder went over rather easily. A tentative start by the visitors. West Ham are not bouncing up and down but will be relatively happy. 7 min: Noble tussles with Matic on halfway but Anthony Taylor pulls up the West Ham captain for a foul. Ashley Young then slips in Marcus Rashford, who tries to race on to the ball at the byline. He gets there but is flagged offside. 5 min: West Ham win a corner after putting Maguire under pressure but Rashford heads away at the front post. That was easy peasy. 4 min: Diop nicks the ball away from Mata and as West Ham fly forward, Haller again does superbly to come deep and spread play. Victor Lindel\u00f6f gets across to intervene, much to the delight of the away supporters. 3 min: Hallers robs Matic 35 yards from goal and West Ham attempt to pick out Fredricks down the right but Noble overcooks his pass. Nice try. This is Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s 50th game in charge of West Ham. How he\u2019d love another victory over United. 1 min: Fornals buys an early throw-in down the right flank. Yarmolenko tries to kickstart an attacking move but West Ham are happy to hold on to possession for the time being. Manchester United get things started at the London Stadium. The teams are in the tunnel! Here we go ... Manuel Pellegrini speaks pre-match. \u201cLast season we played very good against this team, we won very clearly and we were unlucky at Old Trafford,\u201d the West Ham manager says. \u201cWithout any doubt, these are different moments [against Manchester United]. They have so much expectation on that team, they are not fighting for the title and it seems like it is a crisis. But the manager is very good and made the most of last season. The three points for us, and for them, are of course decisive.\u201d Grady Diangana watch, anyone? \u201cFor the Hammers wondering how Diangana is doing at West Brom, he\u2019s only dominating,\u201d emails J.R in Illinois, regarding the on-loan forward. \u201cHe just roasted Jonathan Hogg twice as he wriggled into the box and put the ball on a plate for Phillips to give the Baggies a 3-2 lead.\u201d West Brom now lead 4-2 with seconds remaining at the Hawthorns. Successive defeats incoming for Danny Cowley and Huddersfield Town. Roy Keane sticks the boot in on David de Gea and Harry Maguire, a \u00a380m summer recruit. \u201cUnited didn\u2019t have a choice, they couldn\u2019t afford not to buy him,\u201d Keane says. \u201cThat was the going rate. Man Utd had to buy him, simple as that, because he\u2019s better than what they\u2019ve got. They had to go and do the deal. I\u2019m still concerned about him, his lack of pace in terms of real sprinting but United had no choice.\u201d On De Gea, he says: \u201cI was never convinced by the character side of him, putting demands on people around him. Technically, he\u2019s a good goalkeeper, of course he is, but I\u2019ve always had my question marks over him. On Maguire, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho says: \u201cIf you don\u2019t buy Maguire, I think today [United] would be playing [Victor] Lindel\u00f6f and [Axel] Tuanzebe or Lindel\u00f6f and Phil Jones. Lindel\u00f6f is very, very good in some aspects of the game but he can bullied in the one v one in the box and he\u2019s not especially good in the air. Maguire has that presence, he is not probably the fastest one, but he is quite mobile for his huge body. In the last pre-season [last summer], I was crying for a central defender.\u201d A few murmurs that Mason Greenwood has a bout of tonsillitis, hence him not being involved in the 18-man squad at the London Stadium. It remains a very young Manchester United bench, including Axel Tuanzebe, Tahith Chong and Angel Gomes. The big plus for United, who have drawn their past three away matches, given Daniel James\u2019s early-season form is that the Wales winger has recovered from a back problem. Manuel Pellegrini said Lanzini has a \u201csmall problem\u201d but it is sufficient for him to miss out, with Pablo Fornals, a \u00a324m signing, getting the nod for his second league start. Solskj\u00e6r says Paul Pogba is going nowhere in January: Team news news: No Paul Pogba or Anthony Martial, as expected, for Manchester United, with the pair missing with ankle and thigh problems respectively, while Luke Shaw and Eric Bailly remain absent through injury. United are unchanged from victory over Leicester \u2013 they didn\u2019t name a single unchanged side in the Premier League in 2018-19 \u2013 which means there is no place for 17-year-old Mason Greenwood, who struck the winner over Astana in midweek. Daniel James, however, is deemed fit enough to start after a late fitness test. As for West Ham, Manuel Pellegrini is forced into shuffling the pack, with Aaron Cresswell in for the suspended Arthur Masuaku, while Pablo Fornals replaces Manuel Lanzini. West Ham (4-1-4-1): Fabianski; Fredericks, Diop, Ogbonna, Cresswell; Rice; Yarmolenko, Noble, Fornals, Anderson; Haller Subs: Roberto, Ajeti, Balbuena, Zabaleta, Snodgrass, Sanchez, Wilshere Manchester United (4-2-3-1): De Gea; Wan-Bissaka, Maguire, Lindel\u00f6f, Young; Matic, McTominay, Pereira, Mata, James; Rashford Subs: Romero, Rojo, Tuanzebe, Fred, Gomes, Lingard, Chong Referee: Anthony Taylor The good news for Manchester United? They come into this one on the back of successive wins, and back-to-back clean sheets to boot. The bad news? Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s side are winless in six away matches, another failure to take three points on the road away from matching their miserable Premier League record. Oh, and Roy Keane, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and Graeme Souness will be staring back at them in a swanky and spotless studio. A baby-faced teenager Mason Greenwood, who does not turn 18 until next month, proved the hero for United in midweek, while West Ham are feeling fresh as a daisy, unbeaten since an opening day humbling at Manchester City. \u201cManchester United played on Thursday night [in victory over Astana in the Europa League] but they changed nine players so it will be a different team,\u201d said Manuel Pellegrini. \u201cWe are in a good moment so, if we are playing against the big teams, we must show we can play in the same way.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r, too, is feeling upbeat. \u201cWe feel we are on the right track and, if we keep it up, I believe we will be challenging for the top four at the end of the season,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is wide open at the moment.\u201d For West Ham, who won this fixture in April, this represents a fine chance to stamp their authority.

Back then the bonus-point try did not come until the 80th minute, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/22/rugby-world-cup-england-tonga-match-report\" title=\"\">here with three and a half to go</a>, but it may not have arrived at all save for a moment of individual brilliance from Jonathan Joseph. Just as when beginning their campaign against Pacific Islanders in 2015, England were scrappy. There were 14 handling errors and four early penalties against, including one for obstruction with Maro Itoje and Billy Vunipola not on the same page. When it was given Eddie Jones appeared on the big screen, furiously banging his desk. Ultimately it is a case of job done, the kick-chase functioned well, there are no injury concerns and Tonga never looked like scoring a try. You could hardly blame the waves of neutral supporters who streamed through the exits well before full-time though.</p> \n<h2><strong>Referee\u2019s caution helps him get big decisions right</strong></h2> \n<p>Given the added scrutiny on referees in the opening few days it was inevitable to see Paul Williams take his time over major decisions. He and the TMO Ben Skeen communicated well whenever Williams needed assistance and Williams made the correct decision when opting against reaching for his cards after Sione Kalamafoni\u2019s tackle on Anthony Watson. The trouble is, the first half was nearly an hour long because Williams needed Skeen\u2019s help on four occasions in the opening 40 minutes.

      "bodyText": "Joseph\u2019s brilliance helps seal last-gasp bonus point There were echoes in Sapporo of England\u2019s opener four years ago against Fiji. Back then the bonus-point try did not come until the 80th minute, here with three and a half to go, but it may not have arrived at all save for a moment of individual brilliance from Jonathan Joseph. Just as when beginning their campaign against Pacific Islanders in 2015, England were scrappy. There were 14 handling errors and four early penalties against, including one for obstruction with Maro Itoje and Billy Vunipola not on the same page. When it was given Eddie Jones appeared on the big screen, furiously banging his desk. Ultimately it is a case of job done, the kick-chase functioned well, there are no injury concerns and Tonga never looked like scoring a try. You could hardly blame the waves of neutral supporters who streamed through the exits well before full-time though. Referee\u2019s caution helps him get big decisions right Given the added scrutiny on referees in the opening few days it was inevitable to see Paul Williams take his time over major decisions. He and the TMO Ben Skeen communicated well whenever Williams needed assistance and Williams made the correct decision when opting against reaching for his cards after Sione Kalamafoni\u2019s tackle on Anthony Watson. The trouble is, the first half was nearly an hour long because Williams needed Skeen\u2019s help on four occasions in the opening 40 minutes. Early matches four years ago were plagued by endless TMO reviews which, you sense, has played at least some part in referees preferring to try and let things flow in Japan. It is not easy but the key is striking the right balance. Williams erred on the side of caution given the heat coming World Rugby\u2019s way and he was among the best performers on the pitch. Tonga shackle Vunipola and leave their mark In the first half Billy Vunipola set off on one of his many runs \u2013 in total he made 12 \u2013 but was walloped backwards by Tonga\u2019s openside flanker Zane Kapeli.

The right-back\u2019s shot deflected off Dendoncker and squirmed beyond Rui Patr\u00edcio.</p> <p>The hosts then seized the initiative, with Zaha a constant menace and Kouyat\u00e9 and McArthur taking control of midfield.

The visitors certainly left Selhurst Park the happier team after grabbing a point when defeat looked certain. Having had the better of the first half, Wolves went behind to Leander Dendoncker\u2019s unfortunate own goal immediately after half-time. Joel Ward\u2019s shot from 12 yards deflected in off the Belgian midfielder and Wolves\u2019 problems deepened when Romain Sa\u00efss was sent off after two brainless fouls on Wilfried Zaha. Palace pushed for a second but ultimately paid for their own profligacy, with the substitute Christian Benteke missing the best opportunity. That gave Wolves the impetus for a final, desperate push upfield and, when Ward failed to deal with Adama Traor\u00e9\u2019s cross, the Portuguese was on hand to equalise. Roy Hodgson was left seething on the sidelines after an \u201cunbelievably disappointing\u201d concession, and the Crystal Palace manager bristled when asked if he could take any positives from the game. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to feel positive after you\u2019ve seen three well-deserved points taken away in the last minute. We feel very disappointed and very upset.\u201d The Wolves manager, Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo, was understandably more upbeat, praising his team\u2019s desire to keep fighting after Sa\u00efss was sent off with 20 minutes to play. \u201cWe were one man down, we kept working, kept fighting. It says a lot about the spirit that we have. Every player is working very hard.\u201d Nuno began last season by naming the same starting lineup for the first nine games but accepts the club\u2019s Europa League campaign has taken its toll. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to do what we did last season [but] we knew about this challenge and we have to embrace it.\u201d Wolves rescued a point after an up-and-down contest, with the hosts dominating the second half after being fortunate to go in at half-time level. Wolves created the best chances in the first period, the first coming when Dendoncker\u2019s sidefooted shot from a corner was cleared off the line by James McArthur. After 40 minutes Raul Jim\u00e9nez\u2019s floating cross found Matt Doherty, scorer of the winner here last season, at the back post but Vicente Guaita sprang to his right to deny him. Moments before the break Jota combined beautifully with Jim\u00e9nez but saw his undercooked effort saved. Wolves\u2019 wastefulness was punished immediately after the break. Jeffrey Schlupp burst beyond Willy Boly and cut the ball back before Cheikhou Kouyat\u00e9 seized on the rebound, intelligently assessing his options before slotting to McArthur, who teed up Ward. The right-back\u2019s shot deflected off Dendoncker and squirmed beyond Rui Patr\u00edcio. The hosts then seized the initiative, with Zaha a constant menace and Kouyat\u00e9 and McArthur taking control of midfield. Jim\u00e9nez tested Guaita with an artful flick of the boot but the game appeared up for Wolves moments later when Sa\u00efss tripped Zaha to earn a second booking. Palace sensed an opportunity to kill off the game but Benteke hesitated when through on goal and had his shot parried away by Patr\u00edcio. The goalkeeper also raced off his line to deny Schlupp but his efforts looked to be in vain until the visitors made a final foray upfield deep into stoppage time. With the clock ticking down, Traor\u00e9 swung a hopeful cross in and, as Ward stooped to head away, he slipped and the ball fell perfectly for Jota, who fired high beyond Guaita for his first league goal this season.",

He assumed it was a really nasty bug. Later, he became feverish and decided \u201cto take a few days off uni to get my strength back\u201d.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until he was sitting at his desk the following Thursday, more than a week after symptoms had begun, that he sought medical attention. \u201cMy left arm suddenly went cold and numb.\u201d He walked to the nearest A&amp;E, where he was examined by a flurry of bemused doctors.

It may seem bizarre to feel pain in seemingly unrelated places, says Samani, but \u201cthe nerves that send heart pain to the brain also supply the jaw and the left arm and so on\u201d \u2013 the brain can\u2019t distinguish where it is coming from. The advice is to call 999 or an ambulance. \u201cParticularly as you get older, err on the side of caution,\u201d Samani says.</p> <p>However, even if you are armed with the symptom list, if you are not expecting a heart attack, you, or a doctor, will be likely to attribute experiencing any of them to another illness, or even a panic attack. The thing to look out for, Samani says, is something you have never felt before. Walker says that, when his arm went numb, \u201cit was distinctive and felt alien. We\u2019ve all had our arm go to sleep now and then. It wasn\u2019t like that.

Few fancied Sebastian Vettel, given the season he has had, to control this race the way he did in the second half of this one. But he did, and broke his lean run to win a grand prix that intrigued without ever sparking into life. The safety car interruptions rather broke its flow and stymied some of the potential for drama, certainly at the front of the race, though there was a fair bit of argy-bargy in midfield. But the upshot is this that Ferrari won this particular game of tactical chess to put themselves clear in second in the constructors\u2019 standings, though I suspect we\u2019ll be hearing more about Charles Leclerc\u2019s view of his team\u2019s race strategy. It certainly wasn\u2019t what he wanted. Stay on the site for more reaction, and thanks for following.

Great race, big congratulations to the team. The start of the season was difficult for us but in recent weeks we\u2019ve started to come alive. I\u2019d like to thank the fans, the last couple of weeks have been not the best for me but it\u2019s been incredible to get so many nice messages. It\u2019s given me a lot of strength and belief.\u201d</p> <p>Quizzed about Ferrari\u2019s strategy call? \u201cIt was a very late call [for the undercut] but then I just gave it everything in the outlap, as I saw the two cars in front of me not pitting, then I was surprised a lap later to come out ahead. We controlled it to the end, the car was getting better and better. I received a call the last turn before the pit entry, but for me obviously it worked today.</p> <p>Leclerc swallows his palpable unhappiness to say: \u201cObviously it\u2019s always difficult to lose a win like that but at the end it\u2019s a one-two for the team, all the guys deserved it, we arrived hoping for a podium, and got a one-two. For myself, I\u2019m disappointed for my side, as it sometimes happens, but I\u2019ll come back stronger.\u201d He praises the new car \u201cIt looks positive, more than we expected, they\u2019ve done an amazing job. The strategy was fixed at the beginning of the race, so I stick to the plan,\u201d he adds, possibly pointedly.</p> <p>Verstappen, in third place, says: \u201cThe whole race went well, I\u2019ve got to be happy. I started to struggle a bit with the tyres so we boxed but that was a good call because we undercut Lewis in the end. In general happy to be on the podium, it\u2019s always difficiult to overtake here, so to do it by strategy is good. You\u2019re working harder in a race like this than when you\u2019re going flat out.\u201d</p> <p>And now they\u2019re on the podium for anthem time.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-22T14:28:40.000Z\">at 3.28pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d87817c8f0834740f3c00eb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-22T14:15:17.529Z\">3.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>\u201cAwesome job, well done!\u201d Vettel is told over the radio.

So we move from one type of F1 glamour to another today, from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/08/ferrari-charles-leclerc-italian-f1-gp-monza-win\">venerable Monza</a> last time out to the more futuristic allure of night-time racing at Singapore. There are a couple of constants though: Lewis Hamilton being on course for another world title, and Charles Leclerc\u2019s prodigious form. Fresh from winning in Belgium and Italy, the Monagesque Ferrari driver has only gone and taken pole for a third consecutive race, adding spice to the later stages of this season.<br></p> <p>It all constitutes a massive boost for Ferrari, who\u2019ve had another chequered season, what with Sebastian Vettel\u2019s indifferent form, and they\u2019d not been fancied to do well at a circuit such as Marina Bay given their problems on the slow corners this season. But a new front wing and floor on the car seems to have given them extra grip.</p> <p>A third straight win for Leclerc would be a stunning achievement, but he has Hamilton, second in qualifying, right at his wheel. The Briton has won in Singapore four times, including the previous two races here, so you\u2019d possibly still make him favourite here. Vettel, Max Verstappen and Valtteri Bottas complete the top five on the grid and an engrossing spectacle under the Marina Bay lights beckons. Bring it!<br></p> <p><strong>Lights out 1.10pm BST</strong>.</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "So, we had something of a turn-up here. Few fancied Sebastian Vettel, given the season he has had, to control this race the way he did in the second half of this one. But he did, and broke his lean run to win a grand prix that intrigued without ever sparking into life. The safety car interruptions rather broke its flow and stymied some of the potential for drama, certainly at the front of the race, though there was a fair bit of argy-bargy in midfield. But the upshot is this that Ferrari won this particular game of tactical chess to put themselves clear in second in the constructors\u2019 standings, though I suspect we\u2019ll be hearing more about Charles Leclerc\u2019s view of his team\u2019s race strategy. It certainly wasn\u2019t what he wanted. Stay on the site for more reaction, and thanks for following. Bye. We have an on-the-flag report, from Giles Richards: And here are the championship standings: 1. Lewis Hamilton, Great Britain, Mercedes, 284 points. 2. Valtteri Bottas, Finland, Mercedes, 221. 3.

Whatever Leclerc may feel, he\u2019s part of a team suddenly in chipper mood as their fine late-season form continues. Vettel speaks: \u201cIt feels sweet. Great race, big congratulations to the team. The start of the season was difficult for us but in recent weeks we\u2019ve started to come alive. I\u2019d like to thank the fans, the last couple of weeks have been not the best for me but it\u2019s been incredible to get so many nice messages. It\u2019s given me a lot of strength and belief.\u201d Quizzed about Ferrari\u2019s strategy call? \u201cIt was a very late call [for the undercut] but then I just gave it everything in the outlap, as I saw the two cars in front of me not pitting, then I was surprised a lap later to come out ahead. We controlled it to the end, the car was getting better and better. I received a call the last turn before the pit entry, but for me obviously it worked today. Leclerc swallows his palpable unhappiness to say: \u201cObviously it\u2019s always difficult to lose a win like that but at the end it\u2019s a one-two for the team, all the guys deserved it, we arrived hoping for a podium, and got a one-two. For myself, I\u2019m disappointed for my side, as it sometimes happens, but I\u2019ll come back stronger.\u201d He praises the new car \u201cIt looks positive, more than we expected, they\u2019ve done an amazing job. The strategy was fixed at the beginning of the race, so I stick to the plan,\u201d he adds, possibly pointedly. Verstappen, in third place, says: \u201cThe whole race went well, I\u2019ve got to be happy. I started to struggle a bit with the tyres so we boxed but that was a good call because we undercut Lewis in the end. In general happy to be on the podium, it\u2019s always difficiult to overtake here, so to do it by strategy is good. You\u2019re working harder in a race like this than when you\u2019re going flat out.\u201d And now they\u2019re on the podium for anthem time. \u201cAwesome job, well done!\u201d Vettel is told over the radio. It was a smart drive by the German, who became his team\u2019s main man after the mid-race congestion and stops and starts. Leclerc may be aggrieved. Hamilton may only have come fourth, but his lead has been extended by one point, to 64. He\u2019s still in a very healthy position, even if this really wasn\u2019t Mercedes\u2019 race. Lap 61/61 It\u2019s a one-two for Ferrari. And a third straight win for the team, though Leclerc will be disappointed he couldn\u2019t make it a personal hat-trick. For Vettel, it brings to an end a grim winless run. Hamilton can\u2019t quite get close enough in the key moments to Verstappen, who takes third. Bottas is fifth. Lap 60/61 Verstappen is struggling with power but he does well to hold off Hamilton\u2019s superior engine power. He\u2019s showing all his champion\u2019s competitive aggression here, but he\u2019s still outside the top three. Vettel leads going into the final lap! Lap 59/61 Hamilton closes on Verstappen \u2013 he\u2019s no more than a car length and a half or so behind him now, but Vettel looks unassailable out front. His lead is now over two seconds. Lap 58/61 Kvyatt sets a new fastest lap for the race of 1:44:47 for what it\u2019s worth, though he remains back in 15th. Only for Hamilton to surpass it a few seconds later. Vettel still leads from Leclerc, Verstappen and Hamilton with three laps to go. Lap 57/61 Given what an error-strewn season Vettel has endured, he\u2019s driven with incident-free composure today, for all that Leclerc may gripe. The German leads by 1.9sec now. Hamilton still can\u2019t quite get within range of Verstappen. Magnussen goes in for a tyre change to keep himself in the race. Lap 56/61 Hamilton gets within DRS range of Verstappen but isn\u2019t able to take him on yet, so the podium\u2019s in view for the Red Bull man. Lap 55/61 Time is running out for Leclerc to make his move on Vettel, whose 392-day winless run could be coming to an end. The lead is now 1.2sec as Vettel sets a new fastest lap for the race Lap 54/61 In the mid-market points battle, Gasly is challenging seventh-placed Norris strongly at the moment, with Hulkenburg in ninth and Giovinazzi up into 10th. Lap 53/61 Leclerc keeps Vettel within striking distance \u2013 it\u2019s around a second at the moment \u2013 with Verstappen 2.4sec behind the leader in third, and Hamilton more than a second further back in fourth. His championship lead looks strong still, though it\u2019s not really been his race today. Lap 52/61 Racing resumes as the safety car comes in. Hulkenburg is reporting some car trouble, but is told to keep at it. The stewards will look at the Raikkonen-Kvyatt brouhaha after the race. Ricciardo goes past Magnussen into 13th. As you were at the front for now. Yer punters aren\u2019t happy: Lap 51/61 This is supremely frustrating, and makes it increasingly likely that this race will time out now, with around 17 minutes to go to the two-hour mark. What had seemed tactically intriguing and hard to call might be petering out into a less than thrilling finish. It\u2019s Vettel 1, Leclerc 2, Verstappen 3, Hamilton 4 Bottas 5. Lap 50/61 Kvyatt takes on Raikkonen, breaks and arrives late and forces the Finn right off the track. This means the safety car \u2013 again! Kvyatt survived the kerfuffle, and carried on racing, but having forced himself and Raikkonen off has lost some ground. Raikkonen\u2019s quit. Lap 49/61 A word for mid-race front runner Giovinazzi, who\u2019s recovered some ground after dropping back. He\u2019s 11th, and well placed to challenge for points. Vettel keeps his lead to between 0.9sec and 1.1sec on Leclerc, while Verstappen slightly extends his lead on Hamilton. Lap 48/61 No constructor\u2019s ever had a one-two finish in Singapore. Will we get one here? The safety car comes in and they get ready to fire up again. Vettel builds his lead, taking it to around 0.9sec. Mercedes restarted well, Verstappen trying to gain on Leclerc, whose chances are fading. Ricciardo\u2019s pass on Kvyatt is the first movement as competition is renewed, but then he\u2019s overhauled by three \u2013 Kvyatt, Grosjean and Sainz. Lap 47/61 Charles Leclerc is told over the radio by his team that he needs to bring his car in for new tyres. \u201cI won\u2019t be stupid, I want to finish one-two but I just think this is not fair,\u201d he says. We\u2019re gonna have some talking points after this race. Hamilton almost runs into the back of Verstappen as they prepare for the safety car to come in, which it is due to, after this lap. Lap 46/61 There are, in theory, 15 laps to go but such has been the pace \u2013 or lack of \u2013 in this race that we might hit the two-hour time limit a lap or two short. Lap 45/61 Some cars drive around. A safety car in front of them. The less things change, the better this is likely to be for the Ferraris. Lap 44/61 Back comes the safety car as Sergio Perez walks disconsolately away from his static car, to round off a miserable week. He\u2019s been a touch poorly too. This isn\u2019t going to help Mercedes, mitigating their tyre advantage. Lap 43/61 Leclerc pushes hard on Vettel, within DRS range, but stays second for now, as Perez moves into the top 10 before hitting mechanical bother and grinding to a halt. There\u2019s a fierce scrap for championship points going on in the middle, and some casualties. Lap 42/61 So where do we stand with fewer than 20 laps left? It\u2019s 1 Vettel by 0.7sec from 2 Leclerc 3 Verstappen 4 Hamilton 5 Bottas Lap 41/61 No DRS for the first two laps after the safety car, but plenty of jostling as the Ferraris forge ahead in ominous style. Gasly and Stroll, I think, have had a coming-together further back. Ricciardo, who had to treat a puncture during the safety car period, moves up to 16th, while Hulkenburg moves in front of Stroll in 12th. Stroll now has a puncture having had clashes with first Gasly and now Raikkonen. Lap 40/61 Freedom! The safety car period ends. All to play for in the last 20 laps. Lap 39/61 The safety car is still out, which incidentally maintains its 100% appearance record in grands prix at this circuit. This is probably good news for the Ferrari front runners in terms of tyre preservation. Lap 38/61 Russell\u2019s had to quit the race after that clash. \u201cMy head is down and it will be down until the race is ended\u201d says Leclerc after being told to keep his bonce down and plough on. He doesn\u2019t sound happy, and is displeased with the undercut from his teammate. He\u2019s got a point, having been their man in pole. Lap 37/61 Hulkenburg goes into the pits as the safety car stays out. As they ease round, a reminder of how they stand: 1 Vettel 2 Leclerc 3 Verstappen 4 Hamilton 5 Bottas 6 Albon Lap 36/61 George Russell goes into the wall after a clash with Grossjean as Ferrari try to build a safety car lead. We could now have a safety car, and we do. It\u2019s duly deployed. This means Hamilton will stay out if the Ferraris pit. Game on? Lap 35/61 Giovinazzi pits at last, and he\u2019ll have needed a tyre change anyway after that clash. As does Ricciardo, who also copped some damage in the incident. Vettel leads by just under five seconds from Leclerc. Hamilton reckons Ferrari are running a two-stop race, which gives the safety car some importance. Lap 34/61 Bottas goes wide to pass Giovinazzi, who then clashes with Ricciardo as the latter overhauls him and forces him wide. He could have some damage here, and the Italian is dropping back alarmingly. That\u2019s a real shame. Lap 33/61 Ferrari looking promising now, as Leclerc squeezes past Giovinazzi to give them a one-two at the front. Which driver will the team prioritise from now? Hamilton passes Giovinazzi to move into fourth. He\u2019s not out of this yet, but he is 3.9sec behind Vettel in first. Lap 32/61 Leclerc overhauls Gasly on the corner with consummate skill and no real fuss or resistance. He\u2019s now taking on Giovinazzi on second. Verstappen passes Gasly too. So it\u2019s now 1 Vettel 2 Giovinazzi (yet to pit) 3 Leclerc 4 Verstappen 5 Gasly 6 Hamilton 7 Bottas 8 Albon Lap 31/61 Vettel now leads! He makes quite an easy pass on Giovinazzi. Gasly is third, Leclerc fourth and Verstappen fifth, having just passed Ricciardo, who\u2019s had a pretty decent race considering. Stroll goes into the pits. Lap 30/61 Tyres are wearing easily in these conditions, which adds to the uncertainty as Vettel attacks Gasly and passes him \u2013 did he force him off the track there? \u2013 and now the Ferrari lead man is in second. But will he cop a warning? Lap 29/61 Top fact, and possibly a damning one. Giovinazzi is the first person outside a Mercedes, Red Bull or Ferrari driver to lead a grand prix since Williams at Silverstone in 2015. Meanwhile, Vettel passes Stroll and Ricciardo to seize third place. Leclerc passes Stroll to move into fifth too. Hamilton is still eighth, behind Verstappen in seventh. Lap 28/61 Leclerc tries to go past Stroll in fifth but can\u2019t quite force the opening, and that\u2019s good work from Stroll. Verstappen is looking to exploit such a battle a place further back. Giovinazzi still leads by 1.1sec from Gasly. It\u2019s all about reading and managing the considerable traffic here. Lap 27/61 So Giovinazzi now leads! Verstappen and Vettel try to close, having struggled to make ground, while Hamilton emerges from the pit lane in front of Bottas. He\u2019s eighth, and net-fourth in the race. It\u2019s not a big gap but a lot depends on how Giovanazzi, Gasly and Ricciardo set the pace out front, none of whom have pitted. This is properly intriguing. Hamilton is told \u201cthe race will all happen at the end\u201d. It probably will. Lap 26/61 Leclerc\u2019s easy control of the early stages of the race has certainly gone though he\u2019s still firmly in contention. Hamilton still leads from Giovinazzi. They\u2019re standing by at Mercedes to pit Hamilton \u2026 Lap 25/61 Bottas has just set a fastest lap, and he has a chance of having a net lead over Hamilton post-pitting. He\u2019s currently ninth. In front of him Verstappen (8th), Leclerc (7th) and Vettel (6th), who could be the Ferrari driver most likely to at the moment. Lap 24/61 Hamilton says his tyres \u201care not great but I don\u2019t want you to stop me\u201d at this point. He leads from Giovinazzi, Gasly and Ricciardo, none of whom have pitted. Lap 23/61 Bottas goes into the pits but Hamilton stays out. Of the leaders who\u2019ve pitted, Vettel is sixth, Leclerc seventh, Verstappen eighth and Bottas ninth. Lap 22/61 The data boffins reckon Vettel has a 50/50 chance of being in front of Hamilton after the latter pits. Hamilton says he\u2019s happy with his tyres and is staying out for now. He\u2019s 5.7sec ahead of Bottas (who is also yet to pit) in second, but Vettel is a real threat now. It\u2019s all up in the air at the moment. Lap 21/61 Hamilton is told \u201cOpposite to Leclerc!\u201d, as Leclerc pits at the end of lap 20 and Hamilton powers on out front. The Ferrari driver comes out behind Vettel \u2013 this could be costly for Leclerc and he\u2019s struggling for grip. Leclerc is eighth, Vettel seventh. Lap 20/61 No sooner do I type that than both Vettel and Verstappen pit. Vettel comes out ahead of Hulkenburg but Verstappen doesn\u2019t. That\u2019s a big blow. Vettel is 10th and Verstappen 12th. Which puts Bottas third and Albon fourth. Lap 19/61 The condensed field means pitting remains a risk for the front runners. You\u2019d think Verstappen and Bottas would have pitted by now Lap 18/61 So here\u2019s how they stand: 1 Leclerc by just a second from 2 Hamilton, then 3 Vettel 4 Verstappen 5 Bottas and 6 Albon. Hamilton\u2019s looking well placed to pounce at some point Lap 17/61 Leclerc pushes on, Hamilton hints at pitting soon amid a need to change tyres,but he\u2019s reduced the lead back down to around 1.5sec. Vettel and Verstappen haven\u2019t responded to the upping of the pace though. Raikkonen emerges from the pits but is thwarted skilfully by Kubica before passing him at the second attempt a couple of turns later. He\u2019s 15th. Lap 16/61 Leclerc has upped the pace slightly, while a struggling Raikkonen makes his first pit stop, as Perez sets a new fastest lap. Leclerc leads 1.7sec and has just been given the message to push from his team, and it already shows in an extended lead. How will Hamilton respond? Lap 15/61 Leclerc has been given a message: \u201cBack to mode race\u201d, for whatever that\u2019s worth. His last lap was 1:49.03, and only eight seconds covers the top seven. Lap 14/61 Leclerc faces a test of his race management here, as he seeks to rein in the race\u2019s pace. But he\u2019s still ahead by around 0.9sec from Hamilton, who\u2019s in DRS range. Lando Norris might be one to watch here too as he closes on the top six from seventh place. Lap 13/61 Kvyatt pits, he probably needs to. In midfield, Ricciardo\u2019s energy is forcing the pace, which in turn could exert some pressure on the leading group, who are still very much cruising at present. It\u2019s still Leclerc 1 Hamilton 2, Vettel 5, Verstappen 4 and Bottas 5. Lap 12/61 Hulkenburg is told over the radio that \u201cthe people at the front on soft are struggling\u201d, Hulkenburg having pitted early and changed his tyres up. Lap 11/61 Leclerc\u2019s lead is ambulating between a second and a second and a half. With Vettel a further 1.3sec behind. The most dynamic battle up top remains that between Verstappen in fourth and Bottas in fifth. And further back Kvyatt is passed again, by Perez, who touched the wall in doing so. Skilful driving. Pit window\u2019s a-comin\u2019 Lap 10/61 Bottas is challenging Verstappen strongly for fourth place at the moment, to pep things up for Mercedes. One driver going for it is a pumped-up and slightly embittered Daniel Ricciardo, who goes down the inside of Kvyatt at turn 13 to move into 12th. Stroll passes Kvyatt in the same sequence too. That was deftly done. Lap 9/61 Raikkonen thinks he might have some damage, back in 11th place. Leclerc leads by 1.1sec. Hamilton is second, Vettel third, Verstappen fourth, Bottas fifth. Lap 7/61 Hamilton has been complaining over the radio that his pace is really slow, particularly in the middle sector, and they are certainly trundling around a tad at the moment, but you have to play the long game in these circumstances. Ricciardo pops up another place to 13th. The stewards will take no further action over the Sainz-Hulkenburg clash. Lap 6/61 Christian Horner speaks from the Red Bull team: \u201cWe\u2019ve kept our positions and now it\u2019s like boxers dancing round each other in the ring.\u201d They\u2019re not planning to pit Albon at the moment because he\u2019ll have too much traffic to go through. Leclerc leads Hamilton by 0.95sec, Vettel is 2.3sec behind the leader in third. Lap 5/61 They\u2019re in tyre-preservation mode at the moment, with slightly slower laps, in the stifling heat and humidity of Singapore, so there\u2019s relatively little movement. They\u2019re racing the conditions as well as each other here. Lap 4/61 Hamilton closes to 0.8sec on Leclerc, Ricciardo\u2019s going well after his hampered start \u2013 he\u2019s up to 14th, while the top six are as they were on the grid Lap 3/61 Hamilton begins to make a bit of ground on Leclerc, who is 1.4sec in front, which is pretty impressive for the third lap. Vetell is 2.294sec behind, with Verstappen fourth, Bottas fifth and Albon sixth. It appears there was contact between Sainz and Hulkenburg as the latter sought to close into a gap on turn five Lap 2/61 Hulkenburg is pitting already - possibly after clashing with Sainz - and the Renault driver\u2019s taking hard tyres. The front runners are setting a fierce pace. George Russell is already having a wing change. Sainz is in trouble too, and has pitted. Lap 1/61 Ricciardo\u2019s already passed three drivers at the back, Gasly passes Raikkonen, Sainz is struggling, somethingh might have happened there. Leclerc leads from Hamilton and Vettel And away we go. Leclerc away well and Vettel and Hamilton are tussling furiously, Hamilton defending tenaciously, and Leclerc is flying at the front. They\u2019re off on the formation lap \u2026 Ferrari engineers are giving Charles Leclerc\u2019s car a late once-over, they\u2019ve issued a thumbs-up sign but it\u2019s very hard up against the start of the race to be making adjustments. Max Verstappen, fourth on the grid and third in the championship, speaks, briefly; \u201cStart is always important but there are a lot of things that can get into play, tyre management, safety cars, let\u2019s see.\u201d A disgruntled Daniel Ricciardo, punished for a technical breach for exceeding the power limit on his MGU-K unit during Q1 and starting from the pit lane as a result, is asked about his chances: \u201cNot really the track for it but I\u2019ll try. I don\u2019t want to come across as negative but they\u2019ve definitely taken a big opportunity off me. I\u2019, not impressed, at all, but I\u2019ll see how I go.\u201d Martin Brundle\u2019s doing his pit walk. pointing out the new Ferrari, which doesn\u2019t look much different but it\u2019s done the business for them so far. He\u2019s struggling to find drivers - even the Lighthouse Family have given him the slip. But he does find Adrian Newey of Red Bull who says Ferrari\u2019s changes are \u201cslightly annoying but that\u2019s progress, the new device under the nose has given them more downforce.\u201d Can Red Bull and Verstappen advance from fourth? \u201cIt\u2019s going to be difficult, safety cars come out here often but we\u2019ll see what we can do. He finds Leclerc who describes his qualifying display as \u201cquite a crazy lap but I\u2019m happy with how I finished it and happy to start on pole. The start will be very important, on these first three corners, and Hamilton will be a challenge. Seb [Vettel] will be quick too and it\u2019s not going to be easy to keep them behind It\u2019s a hot, dark atmospheric grid, and they\u2019re now lining up for the anthems. Circuit guide: Marina Bay is 5.063km long, which they\u2019ll be lapping 61 times and with its bumpy street surface coupled and notorious humidity there is plenty for drivers to reckon with. The track features 23 corners, and some unique and quirky features such as Turn 18, which sees the drivers pass beneath a grandstand. Some pre-race reading \u2013 Giles Richards on Sebastian Vettel\u2019s travails: And on yesterday\u2019s qualifying, plus F1\u2019s mooted reverse-grid idea. Any thoughts? How they line up 1 Charles Leclerc (Mon) Ferrari 1min 36.217secs, 2 Lewis Hamilton (Gbr) Mercedes GP 1:36.408, 3 Sebastian Vettel (Ger) Ferrari 1:36.437, 4 Max Verstappen (Ned) Red Bull 1:36.813, 5 Valtteri Bottas (Fin) Mercedes GP 1:37.146, 6 Alexander Albon (Tha) Red Bull 1:37.411, 7 Carlos Sainz (Spa) McLaren 1:37.818, 8 Nico Hulkenberg (Ger) Renault 1:38.264, 9 Lando Norris (Gbr) McLaren 1:38.329, 10 Sergio Perez (Mex) Racing Point 1:38.620, 11 Antonio Giovinazzi (Ita) Alfa Romeo Racing 1:38.697, 12 Pierre Gasly (Fra) Scuderia Toro Rosso 1:38.699, 13 Kimi Raikkonen (Fin) Alfa Romeo Racing 1:38.858, 14 Kevin Magnussen (Den) Haas F1 1:39.650, 15 Daniil Kvyat (Rus) Scuderia Toro Rosso 1:39.957, 16 Lance Stroll (Can) Racing Point 1:39.979, 17 Romain Grosjean (Fra) Haas F1 1:40.277, 18 George Russell (Gbr) Williams 1:40.867, 19 Robert Kubica (Pol) Williams 1:41.186 Disqualified: Daniel Ricciardo (Aus) Renault, disqualified due to breach of technical regulations, but has been given permission to start the race by the stewards. Afternoon/evening everyone. So we move from one type of F1 glamour to another today, from the venerable Monza last time out to the more futuristic allure of night-time racing at Singapore. There are a couple of constants though: Lewis Hamilton being on course for another world title, and Charles Leclerc\u2019s prodigious form. Fresh from winning in Belgium and Italy, the Monagesque Ferrari driver has only gone and taken pole for a third consecutive race, adding spice to the later stages of this season. It all constitutes a massive boost for Ferrari, who\u2019ve had another chequered season, what with Sebastian Vettel\u2019s indifferent form, and they\u2019d not been fancied to do well at a circuit such as Marina Bay given their problems on the slow corners this season. But a new front wing and floor on the car seems to have given them extra grip. A third straight win for Leclerc would be a stunning achievement, but he has Hamilton, second in qualifying, right at his wheel. The Briton has won in Singapore four times, including the previous two races here, so you\u2019d possibly still make him favourite here. Vettel, Max Verstappen and Valtteri Bottas complete the top five on the grid and an engrossing spectacle under the Marina Bay lights beckons. Bring it! Lights out 1.10pm BST.",

      "body": "<p>Jobs, jobs, and more jobs. That is Britain\u2019s economic success story of the last 10 years.</p> <p>While public services crumble and the welfare budget continues to be squeezed, when planning for a no-deal Brexit has displaced almost all other activities in Whitehall, ministers can always point to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/10/uk-jobs-creation-pay-growth-economy-brexit\">the UK economy as a well-oiled jobs machine</a>.</p> <p>More than 3m jobs have been created in the last 10 years. As <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m0008scy/the-cameron-years-series-1-2-the-best-is-yet-to-come\">David Cameron points out in the recent BBC film</a> documenting his time as prime minister, he was negotiating in 2015 with his EU counterparts for concessions on benefit and migration rules while the UK was a magnet for skilled labour and European members looked out over a jobs desert. As he tells the interviewer, by 2015 Britain had created more jobs since the financial crash than the rest of the EU put together.</p> <p>According to the Treasury, the labour market has only improved since then. And especially over the last year when wages growth has climbed above 3% and annual inflation falling, improving the purchasing power of the average household.</p> <p>In July, inflation stood at 2.1% and year-on-year <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/timeseries/kac3/lms\">weekly earnings growth increased to 4%</a> to generate the fastest increases in real incomes for 10 years. Last week, official figures showed that inflation fell to 1.7% in August indicating that real incomes are set to rise further when wages figures for that month are reported.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This bountiful situation forms the economic bedrock on which Brexiters base their case for quitting the EU without a deal.</p> </blockquote> <p>The labour market tells them that employers, despite professing in public statements that they fear leaving the EU, are feeling confident enough to stuff their workers\u2019 wage packets. More than that, Britain\u2019s entrepreneurial spirit lives on.</p> <p>A look under the bonnet presents a different picture. The trend of the last two years to 18 months, far from being a return to the buccaneering age of British innovation (for which you probably have to go back to the 1830s), is a return to public sector spending as the main driver of growth.</p> <p>Private sector pay growth has improved in the last couple of years. However, the jump to 4% can be found in the loosening of pay restraint in the public sector. It\u2019s not by much, as any teacher or nurse will report, but it is enough to lessen the public sector\u2019s drag on the average figure for wages growth.</p> <p>There is also the trend for workers to join the ranks of the self-employed or the part-time workforce. In July, analysis of the labour market by the Office for National Statistics found there were 4.9 million self-employed people in some kind of work, up by 125,000 from a year earlier. This category of flexible worker now makes up 15% of the workforce.</p> <p>Full-time work has also risen, though as a proportion of jobs growth it has lessened as self-employment has returned.</p> <p>Then we need to look at who has grabbed the bulk of the full-time roles created in recent years. Without a doubt the bulk have been taken by older people. They are men aged between 55 and 70 and women in their early sixties who have been forced to carry on working after former chancellor George Osborne increased their state retirement age to 66 at an accelerated rate.</p> <p>Of the 3.4m jobs created over the last 10 years, says the Institute for Employment Studies, 2.5m have been professional or senior jobs, 500,000 are classified as low skilled and just 400,000 sit in the middle as skilled and semi-skilled workers.</p> <p>Young people simply cannot jump into professional and senior roles. They are hoovered up by older workers who, it stands to reason, fit the bill.</p> <p>Going back to the issue of pay, the recent increases reflect rises that were agreed earlier this year. In other words, they lag other statistics that are more contemporaneous.

      "bodyText": "Jobs, jobs, and more jobs. That is Britain\u2019s economic success story of the last 10 years. While public services crumble and the welfare budget continues to be squeezed, when planning for a no-deal Brexit has displaced almost all other activities in Whitehall, ministers can always point to the UK economy as a well-oiled jobs machine. More than 3m jobs have been created in the last 10 years. As David Cameron points out in the recent BBC film documenting his time as prime minister, he was negotiating in 2015 with his EU counterparts for concessions on benefit and migration rules while the UK was a magnet for skilled labour and European members looked out over a jobs desert. As he tells the interviewer, by 2015 Britain had created more jobs since the financial crash than the rest of the EU put together. According to the Treasury, the labour market has only improved since then. And especially over the last year when wages growth has climbed above 3% and annual inflation falling, improving the purchasing power of the average household. In July, inflation stood at 2.1% and year-on-year weekly earnings growth increased to 4% to generate the fastest increases in real incomes for 10 years. Last week, official figures showed that inflation fell to 1.7% in August indicating that real incomes are set to rise further when wages figures for that month are reported. This bountiful situation forms the economic bedrock on which Brexiters base their case for quitting the EU without a deal. The labour market tells them that employers, despite professing in public statements that they fear leaving the EU, are feeling confident enough to stuff their workers\u2019 wage packets. More than that, Britain\u2019s entrepreneurial spirit lives on. A look under the bonnet presents a different picture. The trend of the last two years to 18 months, far from being a return to the buccaneering age of British innovation (for which you probably have to go back to the 1830s), is a return to public sector spending as the main driver of growth. Private sector pay growth has improved in the last couple of years. However, the jump to 4% can be found in the loosening of pay restraint in the public sector. It\u2019s not by much, as any teacher or nurse will report, but it is enough to lessen the public sector\u2019s drag on the average figure for wages growth. There is also the trend for workers to join the ranks of the self-employed or the part-time workforce. In July, analysis of the labour market by the Office for National Statistics found there were 4.9 million self-employed people in some kind of work, up by 125,000 from a year earlier. This category of flexible worker now makes up 15% of the workforce. Full-time work has also risen, though as a proportion of jobs growth it has lessened as self-employment has returned. Then we need to look at who has grabbed the bulk of the full-time roles created in recent years. Without a doubt the bulk have been taken by older people. They are men aged between 55 and 70 and women in their early sixties who have been forced to carry on working after former chancellor George Osborne increased their state retirement age to 66 at an accelerated rate. Of the 3.4m jobs created over the last 10 years, says the Institute for Employment Studies, 2.5m have been professional or senior jobs, 500,000 are classified as low skilled and just 400,000 sit in the middle as skilled and semi-skilled workers. Young people simply cannot jump into professional and senior roles. They are hoovered up by older workers who, it stands to reason, fit the bill. Going back to the issue of pay, the recent increases reflect rises that were agreed earlier this year. In other words, they lag other statistics that are more contemporaneous. Whether anyone is going to get a pay rise this year or next is anyone\u2019s guess, but with inflation falling and the Brexit noose tightening, the odds must be against. Then there is the dramatic rise in Britain\u2019s working population over the last 10 years, which means the economic cake has many more mouths to feed. Official figures show that the inflation-adjusted incomes of the average worker took seven years to recover to 2008 levels. Yet one study after another has shown that the ONS calculation of real terms increases in incomes per head is flawed. One of the main reasons is that the ONS fails to include the effects of austerity on average incomes, and tax increases in particular. Last week, the New Economics Foundation calculated that the average worker was still \u00a3128 a year worse off than in 2008 once VAT rises in 2010 and 2011 were taken into account, among other costs that hit real terms earnings. This report is echoed by previous analysis from the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank, which also disputes the official measure used to calculate inflation adjusted wages. It said annual wages were \u00a3760 lower last year than they were a decade ago. Britain\u2019s productivity, as measured by a worker\u2019s output per hour, is another tick in the box for negative trends. It fell in the last quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019, albeit not by much: 0.1% and 0.2%, respectively. But these small percentage falls are devastating when added to the dire performance over 10 years, the persistent increases notched up by our major competitors, and that the biggest element dragging down the 2018 and 2019 average was a drop in manufacturing productivity. Then you look at where jobs are being created and it is no surprise to find most are in London and the south-east, which voted against Brexit.

      "bodyText": "One of Northern Ireland\u2019s biggest employers faces a crunch week as Wrightbus, which employs 1,400 staff, attempts to stave off collapse by securing a last-minute rescue deal. Mounting financial problems at the Ballymena-based company have left it looking for a buyer, with the Chinese engineering group Weichai and a firm led by the JCB heir, Jo Bamford, understood to be the suitors in talks. However, local MP Ian Paisley told the BBC on Friday he understood talks with the two potential buyers had failed to reach a conclusion. In a separate interview with the Guardian last week, Paisley said: \u201cThe cash pressure on the company is massive. They can\u2019t even think of redundancies in the present situation because of the cash situation. They really do need this injection of cash or a new owner\u201d. Wrights Group on Sunday declined to confirm or deny that the talks with the two parties had collapsed, or discuss if administration is now the most likely option. The spokeswoman said: \u201cThe board of Wrights Group is working hard to ensure the long-term future of the company and its workforce.\u201d Last week, Northern Irish businessman Darren Donnelly pulled out of making a potential bid. Meanwhile, just a day before the problems with the two potential bidders emerged, the company raised staff hopes that a deal was imminent. On Thursday, Wright Bus management told their employees it was \u201cnow in a race to complete a final deal with credible bidders\u201d. It added: \u201cThis ongoing business and its employees are our number one priority and we are confident that a positive outcome can be delivered over the next few days\u201d. While Deloitte is running the sales auction, it is uncertain whether it or another party is being lined up as administrator. Wright Bus, which also manufactured the New Routemaster buses launched by then mayor of London Boris Johnson in 2012, has been struggling with its finances for months and made two rounds of redundancies last year with 95 jobs going in February and June. However, it has also had some success in selling its products and received an order for 20 brand new hydrogen-powered buses, which cost around \u00a3500,000 each and only emit water as exhaust, from Transport for London (TfL) in May. As well as cutting polluting exhaust emissions, the buses will run on green hydrogen produced via North Kent offshore windfarms, according to TfL. The New Routemasters were criticised for being expensive and attracted embarrassing publicity, such as the failing batteries on a large number of vehicles. Further purchases were cancelled by Sadiq Khan, Johnson\u2019s successor as mayor, in 2016.",

      "body": "<p>A Labour government would launch a multibillion-pound plan to reverse austerity cuts to care services and fix England\u2019s growing social care crisis, shadow ministers are expected to announce next week.</p> <p>A \u00a37bn-a-year programme of free personal care for people over 65 who need help with washing, dressing and eating will be at the heart of the strategy, which is likely to be unveiled by the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, on Monday.</p> <p>The plan would pump an additional \u00a38bn into local authority adult social care departments over the next few years to increase the number of care packages, expand specialist dementia services, and invest in higher pay and extra training for care staff.</p> <p>Labour would introduce a lifetime cap limiting the amount individuals pay for residential care before state support kicks in. It does not specify a figure but promises it will be less than the \u00a372,000 cap set in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2015/apr/28/-care-act-2014-quick-guide\">2014 Care Act</a>, which was never implemented.</p> <p>\u201cThe adult care system is so mired in crisis that we have to do something about it,\u201d a Labour source said. \u201cWe have to have a system that is fair across the generations and pools the financial risks.\u201d</p> <p>The plan would be paid for through general taxation, in a clear rejection of the idea, favoured on some on the right, that fair and comprehensive adult social care services can be paid for through private insurance.</p> <p>Free personal care was introduced for over-65s in Scotland in 2002 to pay for help with daily tasks such as bathing, dressing, personal hygiene, going to the toilet, and meal preparation. Numbers receiving free care doubled, but the cost was offset by reductions in costly hospital admissions.</p> <p>Funding will be distributed to councils according to levels of local need, and national standards of eligibility will be set to attempt to remove the postcode lottery by which individuals with similar needs receive differing levels of care depending on where they live.</p> <p>Adult social care has climbed up the domestic political agenda in recent months, amid signs of growing political consensus that the system is in crisis.

      "bodyText": "A Labour government would launch a multibillion-pound plan to reverse austerity cuts to care services and fix England\u2019s growing social care crisis, shadow ministers are expected to announce next week. A \u00a37bn-a-year programme of free personal care for people over 65 who need help with washing, dressing and eating will be at the heart of the strategy, which is likely to be unveiled by the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, on Monday. The plan would pump an additional \u00a38bn into local authority adult social care departments over the next few years to increase the number of care packages, expand specialist dementia services, and invest in higher pay and extra training for care staff. Labour would introduce a lifetime cap limiting the amount individuals pay for residential care before state support kicks in. It does not specify a figure but promises it will be less than the \u00a372,000 cap set in the 2014 Care Act, which was never implemented. \u201cThe adult care system is so mired in crisis that we have to do something about it,\u201d a Labour source said. \u201cWe have to have a system that is fair across the generations and pools the financial risks.\u201d The plan would be paid for through general taxation, in a clear rejection of the idea, favoured on some on the right, that fair and comprehensive adult social care services can be paid for through private insurance. Free personal care was introduced for over-65s in Scotland in 2002 to pay for help with daily tasks such as bathing, dressing, personal hygiene, going to the toilet, and meal preparation. Numbers receiving free care doubled, but the cost was offset by reductions in costly hospital admissions. Funding will be distributed to councils according to levels of local need, and national standards of eligibility will be set to attempt to remove the postcode lottery by which individuals with similar needs receive differing levels of care depending on where they live. Adult social care has climbed up the domestic political agenda in recent months, amid signs of growing political consensus that the system is in crisis. An estimated 1.4 million people who need care are denied it as a result of cuts, means-testing and rationing, while many others receive only basic \u201cclean and feed\u201d levels of care. Providing care for the growing number of older people \u2013 by 2040 a quarter of the UK population will be over 65 \u2013 as well as a big increase in the number of disabled people of working age has put huge strain on councils whose finances have been squeezed by nine years of cuts. Since 2010, \u00a37.7bn has been cut from adult social care budgets in England. Last month the Age UK charity described the care system as \u201cworking at full pelt, stretched to its limit and still failing people left, right and centre\u201d. There are fears that in some areas of England private social care providers dependent on council funding could collapse. It became a key issue for the Tory leadership contenders over the summer, and one of Boris Johnson\u2019s first promises after becoming prime minister was to \u201cfix the crisis in social care\u201d, although plans to publish funding options have reportedly been put back until at least after Christmas. The sheer expense of reforming social care funding has meant that proposals have been vulnerable in recent years to being denigrated as a \u201cdeath tax\u201d or a \u201cdementia tax\u201d, meaning any plans for public investment are seen as electorally high-risk. However, a high-powered all-party House of Lords report in July, chaired by the Tory Lord Forsyth, which anticipated Labour\u2019s policy by calling for billions to be invested in social care, suggests there may be scope for political consensus on the issue.",

      "body": "<p>I was a bright-eyed 18-year-old, just one month into an international study exchange in Stavanger in Norway when I met Eiolf. I stood next to him at a party and we spent the whole night talking. It helped that he was one of the few Norwegian students I met who could actually point to my home country of Malaysia on a map. After that night I\u2019d hang around the library hoping to cross his path. Luckily, he had the same idea.</p> <p>Eiolf was knowledgeable and read a lot, but he also had a goofy sense of humour. He was very kind, too, the sort of person who children and animals gravitate towards. I had assumed that at the end of my exchange I\u2019d go back to Malaysia, but instead I relocated to Norway to be with him; it just felt right. Norway was very different to my homeland, but I settled there and enjoyed a fulfilling career as an anthropologist, while Eiolf became an architect. We were together for 32 years, and I never lost that sense of joy in our relationship. He made me a better version of myself.</p> <p>Eiolf always liked to get to work first and put coffee on for everyone in the office. When he left as usual at 7.30am, it was a completely ordinary summer\u2019s morning. I had no way of knowing it would be the last time I would see my 54-year-old husband alive.</p> <p>Fortunately, a few other people had also gone in early that morning. One of his colleagues saw Eiolf fall. At first he thought he had just tripped, but he very quickly realised something was seriously wrong.</p> <p>I was awake, just out of the shower, and about to start breakfast when the phone rang. It was a doctor from the hospital. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I have bad news,\u201d the doctor said. My heart froze. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, but your husband has died.\u201d Out of the blue, the words were like a slap in my face. \u201cYour husband lost consciousness immediately. He didn\u2019t feel a thing,\u201d the doctor continued. \u201cIt\u2019s the best death any of us could wish for.\u201d I felt a wave of protest rise up inside me. I didn\u2019t agree, not at all, but found it impossible to speak.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What sort of people got involved with fungi and useful plants?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Eiolf died suddenly from heart failure. I found myself endlessly wondering whether he realised what was happening. What was his last thought? Although I knew Eiolf was dead, it was hard to comprehend. I couldn\u2019t help thinking, maybe the doctors had got it all wrong; maybe he would still wake up.</p> <p>That fantasy was dispelled by the funeral. There were umpteen practical questions to be answered. Which coffin? What date? Who had to be informed? I was in pieces, but I had to make decisions. The phone never stopped ringing, no one could believe it. I was in shock, but I had to comfort and support others. On autopilot, I heard words issuing from my mouth yet had no idea where they were coming from. The days raced by as if the fast-forward button had got stuck.</p> <p>I think I must have collapsed after the funeral. It was then that the grief really hit me. Sitting alone in the flat with only my sad thoughts for company, that was when it struck me that Eiolf would never come home from work again. My sorrow swelled until it took over my life. I was swamped by grief: I woke in the morning but had no desire to get up. I viewed the world through one single, solitary peephole, that of my loss and pain.</p> <p>A great era in my life had ended. Everything I had thought of as fixed and permanent was vanishing from view. I missed my old life and wished endlessly that there was a switch I could flick to turn back the clock. On top of that, as an immigrant who had stayed in Norway because of a Norwegian, I found myself asking: \u201cShould I carry on living in this country?\u201d Eiolf\u2019s death had destroyed my sense of where I belonged.</p> <p>It was in this state that I found solace in the most unexpected of places. One of the last things Eiolf and I had done before his death was to sign up for a foraging course with the Greater Oslo Fungi and Useful Plants Society. Neither of us had experience of mushrooming but, ever-curious, Eiolf had been keen.</p> <p>The antiquated name of the body running the course had caught my attention \u2013 it sounded like a sister organisation to the Norwegian Women\u2019s Hygiene Association. What sort of people got involved with fungi and useful plants? To be honest, I wasn\u2019t sure what constituted a useful plant. And what about useless plants? After Eiolf\u2019s death, I had no good reason to attend the course, but then again, I had no reason not to.</p> <p><em><strong>A lot of people </strong></em>had signed up<em><strong> </strong></em>for the course. They were of all ages and came from across the city; the wealthier west side and the poorer east side. As a social scientist, I found this interesting. We associate certain economic classes with particular hobbies. You don\u2019t have to be an anthropologist to discern this pattern in Oslo, although Norwegians value their image as an egalitarian nation.</p> <p>But there was something genuinely classless about the mushroom community that immediately appealed to me. I soon realised you can spend endless hours in their company, but never even find out what mushroomers do in their day-to-day lives. When you are struggling to get through the days, it is liberating to spend time with people who won\u2019t ask you endless questions about your life. Not that mushroomers aren\u2019t chatty, but talk of fungi crowds out everything else. Trivial matters, such as life, death, religion and politics, take a back seat.</p> <p>\u201cSo, what are mushrooms?\u201d the course leader asked at the first class. Most of us said nothing in answer to his question and tried to avoid the teacher\u2019s eye. Surely that was obvious. But I soon discovered there was a lot more to the answer than meets the eye.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trivial matters like life and death took a back seat to mushrooms</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What many people think of when they imagine mushrooms are, in fact, just a small range of fungi, many species of which are microscopic. And they are everywhere \u2013 fungi account for almost 20% of the 44,000 species recorded in Norway. By comparison, mammals are only 0.2%. The mushrooms one sees are only a tiny part of a much greater organism. The bulk of this is formed by a dynamic, living network of long, shoestring-like cells which spread underground or through trees and other plants. What we see growing above ground is the mushroom\u2019s fruit, with the same relationship to the whole organism as an apple has to the apple tree. When conditions are right, wild mushrooms drive upwards through the soil with a force that can split tarmac. From the course leader we learned that, far from growing only in forests, mushrooms grow everywhere. You just need to know how to look.</p> <p><em><strong>A</strong></em><em><strong> walk through </strong></em>the woods<em><strong> </strong></em>became a very different experience. Suddenly, I was seeing mushrooms everywhere; they were popping out at me as if I had been given 3D glasses. Roaming the woodlands around Oslo, I had the impression that I was seeing my surroundings with full attention for the first time since Eiolf\u2019s death. Released from behind the screen that grief had erected between me and the world, I once more connected with my environment.</p> <p>As children, we have all known what it is to be utterly absorbed by something. Mushrooming evokes that state. You switch off from daily trivia and intrusive thoughts of sadness or stress. The hunter-gatherer instinct is kindled, the concentration is sharpened and the tension mounts: will I find that treasure or not?</p> <p>Athletes talk about \u201cflow\u201d. In east Asia, the term \u201cZen moment\u201d has long been used for what happens when you are able to give yourself up to an experience fully. In many ways, flow and Zen are related states. That\u2019s what I discovered I could feel in the peace of the forest. If you want to find mushrooms you have to turn off your mobile phone, switch to mushroom mode, and simply be there \u2013 in the woods.</p> <p>I found myself longing to go to those dark-green forests again and again. I relished the sense of focus that I found there, and the relationships with new friends that sprang up, almost without my noticing, as we hunted together. Now, nine years later, I\u2019ve passed the Norwegian qualifications to become a certified mushroom expert, and I am once more living a life that feels satisfying and meaningful.</p> <p><em>Long Litt Woon\u2019s The Way Through the Woods: of Mushrooms and Mourning, translated by Barbara Haveland, is published by Scribe at \u00a316.99.

I had no way of knowing it would be the last time I would see my 54-year-old husband alive. Fortunately, a few other people had also gone in early that morning. One of his colleagues saw Eiolf fall. At first he thought he had just tripped, but he very quickly realised something was seriously wrong. I was awake, just out of the shower, and about to start breakfast when the phone rang. It was a doctor from the hospital. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I have bad news,\u201d the doctor said. My heart froze. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, but your husband has died.\u201d Out of the blue, the words were like a slap in my face. \u201cYour husband lost consciousness immediately. He didn\u2019t feel a thing,\u201d the doctor continued. \u201cIt\u2019s the best death any of us could wish for.\u201d I felt a wave of protest rise up inside me. I didn\u2019t agree, not at all, but found it impossible to speak. Eiolf died suddenly from heart failure. I found myself endlessly wondering whether he realised what was happening. What was his last thought? Although I knew Eiolf was dead, it was hard to comprehend. I couldn\u2019t help thinking, maybe the doctors had got it all wrong; maybe he would still wake up. That fantasy was dispelled by the funeral. There were umpteen practical questions to be answered. Which coffin? What date? Who had to be informed? I was in pieces, but I had to make decisions. The phone never stopped ringing, no one could believe it. I was in shock, but I had to comfort and support others. On autopilot, I heard words issuing from my mouth yet had no idea where they were coming from. The days raced by as if the fast-forward button had got stuck. I think I must have collapsed after the funeral. It was then that the grief really hit me. Sitting alone in the flat with only my sad thoughts for company, that was when it struck me that Eiolf would never come home from work again. My sorrow swelled until it took over my life. I was swamped by grief: I woke in the morning but had no desire to get up. I viewed the world through one single, solitary peephole, that of my loss and pain. A great era in my life had ended. Everything I had thought of as fixed and permanent was vanishing from view. I missed my old life and wished endlessly that there was a switch I could flick to turn back the clock. On top of that, as an immigrant who had stayed in Norway because of a Norwegian, I found myself asking: \u201cShould I carry on living in this country?\u201d Eiolf\u2019s death had destroyed my sense of where I belonged. It was in this state that I found solace in the most unexpected of places. One of the last things Eiolf and I had done before his death was to sign up for a foraging course with the Greater Oslo Fungi and Useful Plants Society. Neither of us had experience of mushrooming but, ever-curious, Eiolf had been keen. The antiquated name of the body running the course had caught my attention \u2013 it sounded like a sister organisation to the Norwegian Women\u2019s Hygiene Association. What sort of people got involved with fungi and useful plants? To be honest, I wasn\u2019t sure what constituted a useful plant. And what about useless plants? After Eiolf\u2019s death, I had no good reason to attend the course, but then again, I had no reason not to. A lot of people had signed up for the course. They were of all ages and came from across the city; the wealthier west side and the poorer east side. As a social scientist, I found this interesting. We associate certain economic classes with particular hobbies. You don\u2019t have to be an anthropologist to discern this pattern in Oslo, although Norwegians value their image as an egalitarian nation. But there was something genuinely classless about the mushroom community that immediately appealed to me. I soon realised you can spend endless hours in their company, but never even find out what mushroomers do in their day-to-day lives. When you are struggling to get through the days, it is liberating to spend time with people who won\u2019t ask you endless questions about your life. Not that mushroomers aren\u2019t chatty, but talk of fungi crowds out everything else. Trivial matters, such as life, death, religion and politics, take a back seat. \u201cSo, what are mushrooms?\u201d the course leader asked at the first class. Most of us said nothing in answer to his question and tried to avoid the teacher\u2019s eye. Surely that was obvious. But I soon discovered there was a lot more to the answer than meets the eye. What many people think of when they imagine mushrooms are, in fact, just a small range of fungi, many species of which are microscopic. And they are everywhere \u2013 fungi account for almost 20% of the 44,000 species recorded in Norway. By comparison, mammals are only 0.2%. The mushrooms one sees are only a tiny part of a much greater organism. The bulk of this is formed by a dynamic, living network of long, shoestring-like cells which spread underground or through trees and other plants. What we see growing above ground is the mushroom\u2019s fruit, with the same relationship to the whole organism as an apple has to the apple tree. When conditions are right, wild mushrooms drive upwards through the soil with a force that can split tarmac. From the course leader we learned that, far from growing only in forests, mushrooms grow everywhere. You just need to know how to look. A walk through the woods became a very different experience. Suddenly, I was seeing mushrooms everywhere; they were popping out at me as if I had been given 3D glasses. Roaming the woodlands around Oslo, I had the impression that I was seeing my surroundings with full attention for the first time since Eiolf\u2019s death. Released from behind the screen that grief had erected between me and the world, I once more connected with my environment. As children, we have all known what it is to be utterly absorbed by something. Mushrooming evokes that state. You switch off from daily trivia and intrusive thoughts of sadness or stress. The hunter-gatherer instinct is kindled, the concentration is sharpened and the tension mounts: will I find that treasure or not? Athletes talk about \u201cflow\u201d. In east Asia, the term \u201cZen moment\u201d has long been used for what happens when you are able to give yourself up to an experience fully. In many ways, flow and Zen are related states. That\u2019s what I discovered I could feel in the peace of the forest. If you want to find mushrooms you have to turn off your mobile phone, switch to mushroom mode, and simply be there \u2013 in the woods. I found myself longing to go to those dark-green forests again and again. I relished the sense of focus that I found there, and the relationships with new friends that sprang up, almost without my noticing, as we hunted together. Now, nine years later, I\u2019ve passed the Norwegian qualifications to become a certified mushroom expert, and I am once more living a life that feels satisfying and meaningful.

      "body": "<p>Essential to the success of any struggle is to recognise when you have won. It is less than a year and a half since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/07/campaigners-second-eu-referendum-plan-mass-tactical-vote\" title=\"\">People\u2019s Vote campaign</a> was founded. It has organised mass demonstrations, rallies, petitions; its grassroots have leafleted, chanted, sung and often rather pointedly made themselves heard on social media. Their demand was straightforward: any Brexit deal negotiated with the EU should be subject to a confirmatory referendum, with remain as the other option. And that campaign has achieved a dramatic success, compelling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/27/jeremy-corbyn-signals-more-support-for-second-referendum-after-voter-exodus\" title=\"\">Labour to implement its policy</a> if it wins an election. Yet where are the triumphant declarations or the rightly triumphalist victory parties? </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/22/jeremy-corbyn-uk-better-off-brexit-deal-right\" title=\"\">Labour\u2019s leadership</a> is savaged for inconsistency and zigzagging incomprehensibly, as though it is unique or politically bankrupt in its attempt to manage drastically shifting sands and an ever more polarising culture war. For those of us who campaigned for remain in the referendum, there was a particular problem: there was no mass movement on our side. The official remain campaign was a dire, corporate, status quo outfit that did not understand, and was institutionally incapable of relating to, a deep well of disillusionment in British society.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Without tackling the injustices that led to this turmoil, how will social peace ever be achieved?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Remain emerged as a mass movement only after the referendum: or, more accurately, after the 2017 election. In the immediate aftermath of June 2016, many remainers were traumatised but resigned to making the result work. The notion of \u201cno deal\u201d was nowhere within the realms of political possibility, and Nigel Farage had extolled the virtues of Norway, which is a member of the single market. Labour\u2019s position \u2013 that although the referendum had been lost, the result was close, and a deal should be based on a close relationship with the EU \u2013 made sense in a society willing to compromise.</p> <p>Stalwarts of Remainia passionately backed activating article 50, from Anna Soubry to Chuka Umunna, <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/opinion/chuka-umunna-wes-streeting-labour-remainers-will-vote-trigger-article-50-529708\" title=\"\">who argued</a> that \u201cto stand against the decision of the country would be to deepen Labour and the country\u2019s divisions\u201d. Open Britain \u2013 the successor of the official remain campaign \u2013 argued for membership of the single market and the customs union. Labour itself fought its election campaign promising to honour the vote and without committing to the single market and customs union, much to the later chagrin of remainers. </p> <p>What changed? The Tory administration in general, and the Tory Brexiteers in particular, treated the referendum result as though they were an all-conquering army, that the winner takes all. Remainers were not only excluded from the process but were systematically humiliated and insulted by the government. Not only was a hard Brexit offered by Theresa May, but the Brexiteers toxified the possibility of any negotiated deal in favour of the delusion of no deal. When May lost her majority, she should have accepted that the British people had delivered a mandate for a compromise, soft Brexit, and worked on a cross-party basis to secure it; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/07/hard-brexit-theresa-may-mps-eu-withdrawal\" title=\"\">she did not</a>.</p> <p>While some leading remain figures genuinely saw Brexit as a terrible national tragedy, others saw it as a means to attack the Labour leadership and drive a wedge between it and its members and voters, leading to ever worsening bad blood. The consequences have been a progressively more bitter culture war. But what is striking is how swiftly the polarisation has taken place. It was after the UK didn\u2019t leave the EU on 31 March that the dam truly burst, aided by a European election campaign that rewarded the radical sides of the divide.</p> <p>Labour has made errors. Its failure to make a principled case for freedom of movement has been depressing and cowardly. And while certain politically hostile elements have used Brexit as a stick to beat the leadership, there has been a failure to empathise with those seeing it as a disaster capitalist migrant-bashing project. </p> <p>The party should have moved more quickly and decisively when its compromise position had been destroyed in polling stations across the country <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2019/may/27/jeremy-corbyn-reacts-to-labour-losses-in-eu-elections-video\" title=\"\">in the European elections</a>.

Those who apparently will never be satisfied until Corbyn tattoos the EU flag on his face and camps outside parliament bellowing \u201cStop Brexit\u201d should consider that the culture war is ripping the social fabric of British society apart.</p> <p>Without an attempt to bridge a toxic divide, an ugly future awaits us all. If \u2013 in another referendum \u2013 leavers are left feeling like a defeated people presided over by a triumphalist conquering army, the UK will remain a tinderbox. Is demanding Corbyn campaigns passionately for remain, when almost the entire Labour party will do anyway, worth it? The entire political strategy of the UK\u2019s joint prime ministers \u2013 Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings \u2013 rests on a divided remain vote. Without <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/18/election-much-more-brexit-labour-austerity\" title=\"\">tackling the injustices</a> that led to this turmoil \u2013 as Labour is committed to doing \u2013 how will social peace ever be achieved? The truth is Remainia staged an insurrection, and it won. Sometimes you have to accept defeat: what is baffling is, in this case, many seem incapable of accepting victory.</p> <p>\u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "Essential to the success of any struggle is to recognise when you have won. It is less than a year and a half since the People\u2019s Vote campaign was founded. It has organised mass demonstrations, rallies, petitions; its grassroots have leafleted, chanted, sung and often rather pointedly made themselves heard on social media. Their demand was straightforward: any Brexit deal negotiated with the EU should be subject to a confirmatory referendum, with remain as the other option. And that campaign has achieved a dramatic success, compelling Labour to implement its policy if it wins an election. Yet where are the triumphant declarations or the rightly triumphalist victory parties? Labour\u2019s leadership is savaged for inconsistency and zigzagging incomprehensibly, as though it is unique or politically bankrupt in its attempt to manage drastically shifting sands and an ever more polarising culture war. For those of us who campaigned for remain in the referendum, there was a particular problem: there was no mass movement on our side. The official remain campaign was a dire, corporate, status quo outfit that did not understand, and was institutionally incapable of relating to, a deep well of disillusionment in British society. Remain emerged as a mass movement only after the referendum: or, more accurately, after the 2017 election. In the immediate aftermath of June 2016, many remainers were traumatised but resigned to making the result work. The notion of \u201cno deal\u201d was nowhere within the realms of political possibility, and Nigel Farage had extolled the virtues of Norway, which is a member of the single market. Labour\u2019s position \u2013 that although the referendum had been lost, the result was close, and a deal should be based on a close relationship with the EU \u2013 made sense in a society willing to compromise. Stalwarts of Remainia passionately backed activating article 50, from Anna Soubry to Chuka Umunna, who argued that \u201cto stand against the decision of the country would be to deepen Labour and the country\u2019s divisions\u201d. Open Britain \u2013 the successor of the official remain campaign \u2013 argued for membership of the single market and the customs union. Labour itself fought its election campaign promising to honour the vote and without committing to the single market and customs union, much to the later chagrin of remainers. What changed? The Tory administration in general, and the Tory Brexiteers in particular, treated the referendum result as though they were an all-conquering army, that the winner takes all. Remainers were not only excluded from the process but were systematically humiliated and insulted by the government. Not only was a hard Brexit offered by Theresa May, but the Brexiteers toxified the possibility of any negotiated deal in favour of the delusion of no deal. When May lost her majority, she should have accepted that the British people had delivered a mandate for a compromise, soft Brexit, and worked on a cross-party basis to secure it; she did not. While some leading remain figures genuinely saw Brexit as a terrible national tragedy, others saw it as a means to attack the Labour leadership and drive a wedge between it and its members and voters, leading to ever worsening bad blood. The consequences have been a progressively more bitter culture war. But what is striking is how swiftly the polarisation has taken place. It was after the UK didn\u2019t leave the EU on 31 March that the dam truly burst, aided by a European election campaign that rewarded the radical sides of the divide. Labour has made errors. Its failure to make a principled case for freedom of movement has been depressing and cowardly. And while certain politically hostile elements have used Brexit as a stick to beat the leadership, there has been a failure to empathise with those seeing it as a disaster capitalist migrant-bashing project. The party should have moved more quickly and decisively when its compromise position had been destroyed in polling stations across the country in the European elections. A shambolic, misfired attempt to remove Labour\u2019s deputy leader \u2013 however authentic the grassroots anger with him is \u2013 has only fuelled Corbyn\u2019s enemies. But the People\u2019s Vote campaign has triumphed, and the only viable route to ending Brexit lies in the Tories being displaced by Labour as the party of government. Those who apparently will never be satisfied until Corbyn tattoos the EU flag on his face and camps outside parliament bellowing \u201cStop Brexit\u201d should consider that the culture war is ripping the social fabric of British society apart. Without an attempt to bridge a toxic divide, an ugly future awaits us all. If \u2013 in another referendum \u2013 leavers are left feeling like a defeated people presided over by a triumphalist conquering army, the UK will remain a tinderbox. Is demanding Corbyn campaigns passionately for remain, when almost the entire Labour party will do anyway, worth it? The entire political strategy of the UK\u2019s joint prime ministers \u2013 Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings \u2013 rests on a divided remain vote. Without tackling the injustices that led to this turmoil \u2013 as Labour is committed to doing \u2013 how will social peace ever be achieved? The truth is Remainia staged an insurrection, and it won. Sometimes you have to accept defeat: what is baffling is, in this case, many seem incapable of accepting victory. \u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist",

In 2011 there were 152 all-male boards. By last year this had fallen to five. Also, FTSE 100 companies are on track to meet the target of having 30% of board positions occupied by women by 2020.</p> <p>But as former RBS chairman Sir Philip Hampton is well aware, the vast majority of women on boards are non-executives. There are few chief executives, finance directors, company secretaries or heads of operations. Even among non-executives, few hold the position of chair. That at least may be about to change. The Financial Reporting Council wants chairmen and chairwomen to step down after nine years.

      "bodyText": "Alison Rose\u2019s elevation to the top job at RBS, where she will succeed Ross McEwan as chief executive, is cause for celebration. Never before has the UK had a woman running one of its big four banks. Rose\u2019s achievement is all the more remarkable for her journey through the bank, not so much for being one of the survivors after its near-demise in the 2008 financial crash, but for gaining experience in most key departments over a career spanning 27 years. The word remarkable is applicable because her elevation comes after a series of high-profile campaigns that have failed to improve women\u2019s lamentably slow climb up the corporate ladder. At each level of responsibility, more women than men drop out or move sideways, leaving the field clear for male executives to grab the next available senior role. The management consultancy McKinsey blames a culture of \u201cmicro-aggression\u201d that deters women from staying in senior roles, let alone pushing for promotion. The case of Stacey Macken epitomises behaviour across the City, if not the entire financial services sector, where constant sniping, usually under the guise of \u201cbanter\u201d, can eat away at women\u2019s confidence. Macken sued the London office of BNP Paribas for \u00a34m on two counts. The first was on the basis of unequal pay, claiming she was discriminated against because of her gender and paid significantly less than a male co-worker with the same job title. A further claim related to harassment was dismissed. She complained that her colleagues adopted and relentlessly repeated the standard response of \u201cnot now Stacey\u201d used by a manager to many of her queries. The Chartered Management Institute has welcomed Rose\u2019s appointment, but laments how the Macken case shows that after each step forward in the finance industry, there is usually also a step back. McKinsey research has shown that companies with the greatest gender diversity in the boardroom are 21% more likely to be more profitable than their peers and 27% more likely to create superior value. These figures are quoted in a recent report for the government by Rose, who was asked to review how banks could better serve women who want to start a new business. To illustrate how sexism is endemic in the finance industry, she pointed out how only 1% of all-female startup companies are backed by venture capital funds. It will be interesting to see whether Rose, now she is the boss at RBS, carries through some of her recommendations, one of which was to \u201creview existing and create new banking products aimed at entrepreneurs with family care responsibilities\u201d. If Rose is serious about making changes, she will be part of a broader trend. The UK has seen progress in its top 350 companies over the past eight years. In 2011 there were 152 all-male boards. By last year this had fallen to five. Also, FTSE 100 companies are on track to meet the target of having 30% of board positions occupied by women by 2020. But as former RBS chairman Sir Philip Hampton is well aware, the vast majority of women on boards are non-executives. There are few chief executives, finance directors, company secretaries or heads of operations. Even among non-executives, few hold the position of chair. That at least may be about to change. The Financial Reporting Council wants chairmen and chairwomen to step down after nine years. Given the age of many of them, there could be as many as 120 vacancies across the FTSE 350 in the next couple of years. Companies should grab this opportunity and end the tokenism that has blinkered their previous actions. Before long they will probably raise their productivity, or the amount of money generated per worker. This means higher wages for all \u2013 women included.

If Trump could stop flip-flopping in his battle to reduce China\u2019s trade barriers, there would be a stronger recovery than anything interest rates could offer. Even a full makeover may not turn Debenhams fashionable again So Debenhams limps on after successfully fending off a legal challenge bankrolled by arch-rival Mike Ashley \u2013 owner of rival department store chain House of Fraser \u2013 that threatened to push it into administration. Ashley, bitter after losing a \u00a3150m bet on the struggling department store\u2019s shares, is now out of ammunition for the time being. So Debenhams can get back to attempting to rise from the ashes in the wake of the April rescue deal that saw it taken over by its lenders. First on the to-do list for Stefaan Vansteenkiste, the new chief executive, is the company voluntary arrangement (a popular insolvency tool used by retailers to close unwanted stores and cut its rent bill) announced earlier this year. That plan will see at least 22 of its 166 UK stores close in January, but beyond that the outlook for a business operating in one of UK retail\u2019s least-loved sectors remains uncertain. There is also a grim read from the rival John Lewis department store chain, which a fortnight ago revealed that it had made a \u00a326m loss in the first six months of its financial year as the moribund housing market and Brexit-related uncertainty hit demand for expensive home furnishings. There is not much encouragement to be found from House of Fraser either. A year after its rescue by Sports Direct, it is losing more than \u00a31m a week and Ashley reckons the problems could be \u201cterminal\u201d. Shutting a few shops simply won\u2019t solve Debenhams\u2019 biggest problem, which is that its retail offer is hideously outdated.

      "body": "<p>Ruth King (not her real name) can still remember the call coming through on her mobile. She thinks of that moment as \u201cthe start of hell\u201d. \u201cIt was four years ago, but I remember it clear as day,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was my friend warning that there were videos of me everywhere. Her husband worked at a local factory and pornographic videos of me were being shared between all the workers.\u201d</p> <p>King\u2019s instant response was to vomit. \u201cI was working with my dad \u2013 he\u2019s an old-fashioned type of guy, so what could I say? I told him I wasn\u2019t well and went home.\u201d Almost as soon as she got there, another friend, a builder, called to tell her the same videos were being passed around his building site. \u201cHe said: \u2018I didn\u2019t believe they were of you, Ruth, but I looked and they are.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Seven videos had been posted on porn sites by King\u2019s ex-partner. When she looked online, they had been shared tens of thousands of times. \u201cThe comments underneath were disgusting \u2013 men describing what they\u2019d do to me,\u201d says King, who is now in her late 30s and a mother. \u201cI live in a rural area where everyone knows everyone and my life has never been the same since. It\u2019s torture for the soul.\u201d</p> <p>The government\u2019s recent decision <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/jun/26/revenge-porn-and-cyber-flashing-laws-go-under-review\" title=\"\">to review the laws</a> surrounding so-called \u201crevenge porn\u201d is acknowledgment that the current provision is no match for this ever-evolving crime. Campaigners have flagged up an alarming list of shortfalls. It is still not even categorised as a \u201csexual offence\u201d \u2013 although to victims, it can feel every bit as violating. Sentences are light and prosecutions rare, requiring proof of \u201cdirect intention to cause distress\u201d (which means perpetrators who claim they posted the images for a laugh are off the hook). Fake Photoshopped porn isn\u2019t covered at all \u2013 no matter how convincing. </p> <p>The UK\u2019s sole specialist support is the <a href=\"https://revengepornhelpline.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Revenge Porn Helpline</a>, which has a staff of three (only one of whom is full-time). It takes calls from victims in extreme distress, who are often suicidal, and works flat out to remove content before it spreads across multiple platforms.</p> <p>Although the number of revenge porn cases reported to the police has more than doubled since 2015, experts believe it is impossible to estimate their true scale since most victims do not seek help. One <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330868329_Image-based_sexual_abuse_A_snapshot_of_New_Zealand_adults%27_experiences\" title=\"\">nationwide study in New Zealand</a> suggested 5% of adults have experienced it; <a href=\"https://www.cybercivilrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/CCRI-2017-Research-Report.pdf\" title=\"\">another in the US</a> put the figure at almost 13%. Calls to the Revenge Porn Helpline indicate that 70% of victims in the UK are women.</p> <p>Clare McGlynn, professor of law at Durham University, believes the whole area is underestimated and poorly understood. She points out that the very term revenge porn is inaccurate, failing to highlight the range of motives behind it, and painfully insensitive to victims. (\u201cRevenge\u201d implies the perpetrators have been somehow wronged \u2013 and should the victim\u2019s images be labelled \u201cporn\u201d without consent?)</p> <p>McGlynn worked on the most comprehensive study to date of the impact that image-based sexual abuse has on victims \u2013 <a href=\"http://dro.dur.ac.uk/28683/\" title=\"\">Shattering Lives and Myths</a> was launched in parliament in July.</p> <p>\u201cWhat really came across was the social rupture \u2013 how it divides lives into \u2018before\u2019 and \u2018after\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cSome women lost jobs, relationships. They were isolated from family, friends, they withdrew entirely from the online world. And that was constant, an almost daily threat hanging over them. They\u2019re always rediscovering it, or waiting for it to be redistributed. They see no time when the abuse will be over.\u201d</p> <p>King ironically refers to it as \u201cthe gift that keeps on giving\u201d. The videos of her had been created when she had separated from her husband and become involved with an abusive man for nine months. This is something else that comes through in the Shattering Lives report. These images are often taken against a backdrop of coercion and the threat of distributing them is a means of control. Half the women in the report believed this was their partner\u2019s primary motive.</p> <p>\u201cHe swept me off my feet,\u201d says King. \u201cAt the beginning, I was besotted and that\u2019s when he asked for videos, telling me exactly what he wanted me to do. I can, hand on heart, say it\u2019s not something I\u2019d have even thought to do on my own.\u201d</p> <p>The relationship soured fast. The man was controlling and then violent, once strangling King to the point of her passing out. One evening, the couple were watching TV when he plugged in a memory stick and videos appeared on the screen. \u201cHe was quietly showing me how much damage he could do if I left him,\u201d says King. \u201cBut I still had to get out. My life was in danger.\u201d When she ended the relationship and reunited with her husband, the texts started \u2013 more than 100 a day threatening to share the videos. Finally, he did.</p> <p>\u201cFirst, my survival instinct kicked in,\u201d says King. \u201cI called the police who told me they couldn\u2019t prove it was him because the videos had been shared hundreds of thousands of times. The Revenge Porn Helpline helped me remove videos \u2013 and each time I\u2019d feel elated \u2013 but within a day, they\u2019d be back, posted with a different title. \u201cI changed my whole look,\u201d she says. \u201cI isolated myself, and stopped going out almost completely. I couldn\u2019t even collect the children from school. My husband did everything. He\u2019s quite high up in a local business and his staff all saw the videos, too.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone saw them,\u201d she continues. \u201cTwo years after the first post, an older man I\u2019d known my whole life came up to me and told me he\u2019d like to see what I was like in real life. I couldn\u2019t speak. I was like a frightened rabbit. It\u2019s continual \u2013 not one incident like an assault that finishes, so you can try to recover.\u201d</p> <p>In 2017, King says, it all became too much. She tried to kill herself and ended up in hospital. \u201cIt feels really selfish now, but I couldn\u2019t cope. There\u2019s no end and no escape because the web is worldwide. You feel so, so exposed.\u201d</p> <p>Mikala Monsoon, 23, a makeup artist from Glasgow, understands this all too well. She describes the feeling as \u201clike one of those dreams when you\u2019re naked in a glass chamber\u201d.</p> <p>Monsoon was 17 when she sent the pictures that are still resurfacing six years on. \u201cI was at a very low point in my life, flirting with a couple of people on Tinder,\u201d she says. She doesn\u2019t know who posted the images, but about a year later, a friend messaged to say: \u2018This is embarrassing, but I felt I should tell you I found this.\u2019 The attached link took Monsoon to a porn site displaying a picture of her alongside her full name. She had it taken down, but every few months, someone would contact her to say they had found it again.</p> <p>\u201cIt was mortifying,\u201d she says. \u201cEach time, I\u2019d spend a month obsessively Googling my name several times a day, finding stuff. I was really wary of people looking at me or talking to me and still am. I was in a cafe yesterday and these men were staring the whole time. Was it because they\u2019d seen the picture?</p> <p>\u201cIt never goes away. What if I applied for a job and my employers Googled my name? Or if I wanted a future in the public eye? Would everything link back to it for ever?\u201d While King changed her appearance, Monsoon changed her name and moved cities.</p> <p>But this year Monsoon decided to go public. Someone had found the picture on a file-sharing site that contained hundreds of folders and thousands of explicit images \u2013 Monsoon was in the \u201cGlasgow Girls\u201d folder and there were folders for cities across the UK. \u201cThis time, I got really angry. I was sick of it,\u201d says Monsoon. She wrote an Instagram post about it and was inundated by messages from other women<strong> </strong>who had experienced the same thing. She set up a website <a href=\"https://www.revengeonrevengeporn.com/\" title=\"\">revengeonrevengeporn.com</a> and started a petition to force companies to ensure consent before uploading explicit content.</p> <p>\u201cI used to keep very quiet about it, but now I\u2019m a bit more empowered,\u201d says Monsoon. \u201cI refuse to be ashamed. People think it\u2019s OK to say: \u2018You shouldn\u2019t have taken the pictures.\u2019 Would you tell a rape victim she shouldn\u2019t have worn a short skirt?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m in a relationship now and if my partner and I are apart and I want to send him a picture, I\u2019ll do it. Telling women not to take a photo isn\u2019t the answer,\u201d she says. \u201cSome women are coerced into it. Others have their pictures taken when they\u2019re asleep or in the shower, without their knowledge. You can end up on deep fake stuff that everyone believes is real. You just need to exist to become a victim.\u201d</p> <p>Folami Prehaye, 49, an HR/quality audit manager from Bristol and a mother of two adult children, is another victim who firmly rejects shame and blame. \u201cA lot of people have said: \u2018Why did you take the photographs?\u2019 but, at the end of the day, that ain\u2019t the crime,\u201d she says.</p> <p>In 2012, Prehaye\u2019s pictures were posted by an ex-partner on to multiple porn sites as well as a fake Facebook account in her name \u2013 with friend requests sent to all her friends. She went straight to the police \u2013 and although Monsoon and King found them unhelpful, Prehaye\u2019s experience was more positive.</p> <p>\u201cI had to sit opposite this officer while he clicked on every link,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought: \u2018Folami, you know what? You\u2019ve had two children. It\u2019s a means to an end. Just deal with it.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>This wasn\u2019t always easy, of course. Her colleagues saw the pictures and she was sent on \u201cgardening leave\u201d.

Since this abuse is not categorised as a sex crime, Prehaye had no automatic anonymity (something she and other campaigners are trying to change) and a local paper reported the details, including her name. \u201cThen another journalist requested a full interview and I asked my children what they thought. They said: \u2018Mum, you\u2019ve got an opportunity here \u2026\u2019</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to run and hide and be sitting on a beach at 70 only to be told that someone has found a photo of me again,\u201d says Prehaye. \u201cI couldn\u2019t live like that.

      "bodyText": "Ruth King (not her real name) can still remember the call coming through on her mobile. She thinks of that moment as \u201cthe start of hell\u201d. \u201cIt was four years ago, but I remember it clear as day,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was my friend warning that there were videos of me everywhere. Her husband worked at a local factory and pornographic videos of me were being shared between all the workers.\u201d King\u2019s instant response was to vomit. \u201cI was working with my dad \u2013 he\u2019s an old-fashioned type of guy, so what could I say? I told him I wasn\u2019t well and went home.\u201d Almost as soon as she got there, another friend, a builder, called to tell her the same videos were being passed around his building site. \u201cHe said: \u2018I didn\u2019t believe they were of you, Ruth, but I looked and they are.\u2019\u201d Seven videos had been posted on porn sites by King\u2019s ex-partner. When she looked online, they had been shared tens of thousands of times. \u201cThe comments underneath were disgusting \u2013 men describing what they\u2019d do to me,\u201d says King, who is now in her late 30s and a mother. \u201cI live in a rural area where everyone knows everyone and my life has never been the same since. It\u2019s torture for the soul.\u201d The government\u2019s recent decision to review the laws surrounding so-called \u201crevenge porn\u201d is acknowledgment that the current provision is no match for this ever-evolving crime. Campaigners have flagged up an alarming list of shortfalls. It is still not even categorised as a \u201csexual offence\u201d \u2013 although to victims, it can feel every bit as violating. Sentences are light and prosecutions rare, requiring proof of \u201cdirect intention to cause distress\u201d (which means perpetrators who claim they posted the images for a laugh are off the hook). Fake Photoshopped porn isn\u2019t covered at all \u2013 no matter how convincing. The UK\u2019s sole specialist support is the Revenge Porn Helpline, which has a staff of three (only one of whom is full-time). It takes calls from victims in extreme distress, who are often suicidal, and works flat out to remove content before it spreads across multiple platforms. Although the number of revenge porn cases reported to the police has more than doubled since 2015, experts believe it is impossible to estimate their true scale since most victims do not seek help. One nationwide study in New Zealand suggested 5% of adults have experienced it; another in the US put the figure at almost 13%. Calls to the Revenge Porn Helpline indicate that 70% of victims in the UK are women. Clare McGlynn, professor of law at Durham University, believes the whole area is underestimated and poorly understood. She points out that the very term revenge porn is inaccurate, failing to highlight the range of motives behind it, and painfully insensitive to victims. (\u201cRevenge\u201d implies the perpetrators have been somehow wronged \u2013 and should the victim\u2019s images be labelled \u201cporn\u201d without consent?) McGlynn worked on the most comprehensive study to date of the impact that image-based sexual abuse has on victims \u2013 Shattering Lives and Myths was launched in parliament in July. \u201cWhat really came across was the social rupture \u2013 how it divides lives into \u2018before\u2019 and \u2018after\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cSome women lost jobs, relationships. They were isolated from family, friends, they withdrew entirely from the online world. And that was constant, an almost daily threat hanging over them. They\u2019re always rediscovering it, or waiting for it to be redistributed. They see no time when the abuse will be over.\u201d King ironically refers to it as \u201cthe gift that keeps on giving\u201d. The videos of her had been created when she had separated from her husband and become involved with an abusive man for nine months. This is something else that comes through in the Shattering Lives report. These images are often taken against a backdrop of coercion and the threat of distributing them is a means of control. Half the women in the report believed this was their partner\u2019s primary motive. \u201cHe swept me off my feet,\u201d says King. \u201cAt the beginning, I was besotted and that\u2019s when he asked for videos, telling me exactly what he wanted me to do. I can, hand on heart, say it\u2019s not something I\u2019d have even thought to do on my own.\u201d The relationship soured fast. The man was controlling and then violent, once strangling King to the point of her passing out. One evening, the couple were watching TV when he plugged in a memory stick and videos appeared on the screen. \u201cHe was quietly showing me how much damage he could do if I left him,\u201d says King. \u201cBut I still had to get out. My life was in danger.\u201d When she ended the relationship and reunited with her husband, the texts started \u2013 more than 100 a day threatening to share the videos. Finally, he did. \u201cFirst, my survival instinct kicked in,\u201d says King. \u201cI called the police who told me they couldn\u2019t prove it was him because the videos had been shared hundreds of thousands of times. The Revenge Porn Helpline helped me remove videos \u2013 and each time I\u2019d feel elated \u2013 but within a day, they\u2019d be back, posted with a different title. \u201cI changed my whole look,\u201d she says. \u201cI isolated myself, and stopped going out almost completely. I couldn\u2019t even collect the children from school. My husband did everything. He\u2019s quite high up in a local business and his staff all saw the videos, too. \u201cEveryone saw them,\u201d she continues. \u201cTwo years after the first post, an older man I\u2019d known my whole life came up to me and told me he\u2019d like to see what I was like in real life. I couldn\u2019t speak. I was like a frightened rabbit. It\u2019s continual \u2013 not one incident like an assault that finishes, so you can try to recover.\u201d In 2017, King says, it all became too much. She tried to kill herself and ended up in hospital. \u201cIt feels really selfish now, but I couldn\u2019t cope. There\u2019s no end and no escape because the web is worldwide. You feel so, so exposed.\u201d Mikala Monsoon, 23, a makeup artist from Glasgow, understands this all too well. She describes the feeling as \u201clike one of those dreams when you\u2019re naked in a glass chamber\u201d. Monsoon was 17 when she sent the pictures that are still resurfacing six years on. \u201cI was at a very low point in my life, flirting with a couple of people on Tinder,\u201d she says. She doesn\u2019t know who posted the images, but about a year later, a friend messaged to say: \u2018This is embarrassing, but I felt I should tell you I found this.\u2019 The attached link took Monsoon to a porn site displaying a picture of her alongside her full name. She had it taken down, but every few months, someone would contact her to say they had found it again. \u201cIt was mortifying,\u201d she says. \u201cEach time, I\u2019d spend a month obsessively Googling my name several times a day, finding stuff. I was really wary of people looking at me or talking to me and still am. I was in a cafe yesterday and these men were staring the whole time. Was it because they\u2019d seen the picture? \u201cIt never goes away. What if I applied for a job and my employers Googled my name? Or if I wanted a future in the public eye? Would everything link back to it for ever?\u201d While King changed her appearance, Monsoon changed her name and moved cities. But this year Monsoon decided to go public. Someone had found the picture on a file-sharing site that contained hundreds of folders and thousands of explicit images \u2013 Monsoon was in the \u201cGlasgow Girls\u201d folder and there were folders for cities across the UK. \u201cThis time, I got really angry. I was sick of it,\u201d says Monsoon. She wrote an Instagram post about it and was inundated by messages from other women who had experienced the same thing. She set up a website revengeonrevengeporn.com and started a petition to force companies to ensure consent before uploading explicit content. \u201cI used to keep very quiet about it, but now I\u2019m a bit more empowered,\u201d says Monsoon. \u201cI refuse to be ashamed. People think it\u2019s OK to say: \u2018You shouldn\u2019t have taken the pictures.\u2019 Would you tell a rape victim she shouldn\u2019t have worn a short skirt? \u201cI\u2019m in a relationship now and if my partner and I are apart and I want to send him a picture, I\u2019ll do it. Telling women not to take a photo isn\u2019t the answer,\u201d she says. \u201cSome women are coerced into it. Others have their pictures taken when they\u2019re asleep or in the shower, without their knowledge. You can end up on deep fake stuff that everyone believes is real. You just need to exist to become a victim.\u201d Folami Prehaye, 49, an HR/quality audit manager from Bristol and a mother of two adult children, is another victim who firmly rejects shame and blame. \u201cA lot of people have said: \u2018Why did you take the photographs?\u2019 but, at the end of the day, that ain\u2019t the crime,\u201d she says. In 2012, Prehaye\u2019s pictures were posted by an ex-partner on to multiple porn sites as well as a fake Facebook account in her name \u2013 with friend requests sent to all her friends. She went straight to the police \u2013 and although Monsoon and King found them unhelpful, Prehaye\u2019s experience was more positive. \u201cI had to sit opposite this officer while he clicked on every link,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought: \u2018Folami, you know what? You\u2019ve had two children. It\u2019s a means to an end. Just deal with it.\u2019\u201d This wasn\u2019t always easy, of course. Her colleagues saw the pictures and she was sent on \u201cgardening leave\u201d. (She has since changed jobs.) \u201cThere were times I wouldn\u2019t go out and I couldn\u2019t eat; I stayed at home hooded up.\u201d Her ex was charged and received a six-month suspended sentence. Since this abuse is not categorised as a sex crime, Prehaye had no automatic anonymity (something she and other campaigners are trying to change) and a local paper reported the details, including her name. \u201cThen another journalist requested a full interview and I asked my children what they thought. They said: \u2018Mum, you\u2019ve got an opportunity here \u2026\u2019 \u201cI didn\u2019t want to run and hide and be sitting on a beach at 70 only to be told that someone has found a photo of me again,\u201d says Prehaye. \u201cI couldn\u2019t live like that. Speaking out was about taking back control.\u201d Prehaye gave the interview, then set up a website, voic.org.uk (Victims of Internet Crime). She is regularly contacted by victims from across the world. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s part of the healing,\u201d she says. \u201cSome people go to counsellors, but I didn\u2019t. If I help one person by sharing my story, then that helps me too.\u201d \u201cTaking on a public persona can be hugely empowering,\u201d says McGlynn, \u201cbut that\u2019s only ever going to be an option for a very small number.\u201d For most victims, the impact of speaking out on their children, partner and careers would be too great. Sophie Mortimer, the manager of the Revenge Porn Helpline, says what helps victims most is swift removal of images and access to justice. \u201cIt makes a huge difference when the police take it seriously, the case is prosecuted and society acknowledges what happened is very wrong, instead of blaming you,\u201d she says. King was helped by two years of therapy and the support of her husband. \u201cWithout him, I wouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d she says. \u201cIt has caused him so much trouble and he has never once used it against me.\u201d She also found support in surprising places. \u201cOne woman I barely knew crossed the road to speak to me. She said that what happened to me was awful and how sorry she was. Things like that really helped.\u201d King plans to tell her daughter the full story when she starts secondary school. Until then, she is staying anonymous. \u201cSome days are better than others,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a work in progress, but manageable.\u201d King does the school run now, and is able to walk past groups of men without giving into the urge to run away. Most importantly, she hasn\u2019t searched for the videos in more than a year. \u201cThey\u2019re still out there and if I looked, I\u2019d find them,\u201d she says. \u201cFor your own survival, at some point, you have to stop.\u201d \u2022 The Revenge Porn Helpline can be reached on 0345 6000 459.

      "body": "<p>Anyone who has passed through Cambridge recently (the one in the English countryside, not the one in Massachusetts),would have noticed that the ivory towers glint and sprawl with technological investment. \u201cSilicon Fen\u201d, as it is appropriately known, has been a key investment site for global technology companies wanting to tap into Cambridge University\u2019s research capacities. Google is one such company, and now it has an added interest in East Anglia as it is partnering with local news company Archant to create three digital newsrooms in communities \u201ccurrently underserved by news\u201d.</p> <p>The venture, <a href=\"https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/google-to-give-archant-millions-to-find-way-to-make-local-news-pay-online/\" title=\"\">Project Neon</a>, looks very much a carbon copy of <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/google-news-initiative/mcclatchy-and-google-partner-experimental-lab-local-news/\" title=\"\">Project Compass</a> in the US, where Google is also partnering with a large local news chain, McClatchy, to set up digital outlets in news deserts.</p> <p>The first Project Compass experiment will be based in Youngstown Ohio, where the local newspaper, The Vindicator, printed its final edition on 31 August. It had succumbed to the pressures of falling revenues caused by a shift in newspaper reading habits and by the migration of advertising revenues to principally Google and Facebook.</p> <p>The Neon Compass projects are fascinating in that they represent the most direct intervention to date of any technology company in providing news.</p> <p>Both Google and Facebook are spending about <a href=\"https://www.cjr.org/the_new_gatekeepers/facebook-journalism-funding.php\" title=\"\">$100m (\u00a380m) a year each on journalism projects</a> of a wide variety, but almost all of it is in grants or support to third parties.</p> <p>Stepping into the arena of building newsrooms alongside commercial news organisations \u2013 albeit to \u201cexperiment\u201d with new models \u2013 brings with it obvious questions about potential conflict of interest, as well as the possibility that the two decades of failing to fix local news will soon be at an end.</p> <p>This type of investment raises the theoretical, but not impossible, scenario that Archant newsrooms will be simultaneously working with Google, and reporting on the activities and investments of the company in East Anglia. If Google continues its charitable support for news projects this will be a dilemma editors are likely to face with increasing regularity.</p> <p>As if to make the point, the outgoing <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/33122eb0-da48-11e9-8f9b-77216ebe1f17\" title=\"\">Ofcom head, Sharon White, addressed the issue </a>of tech company dominance in remarks made (coincidentally) in Cambridge at the Royal Television Society conference last week, where she expressed the personal view that online platforms needed to step up their side of the \u201csocial contract\u201d and that one way or another contribute to the safeguarding of public service media, be it through <a href=\"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0024/156156/annual-report-18-19.pdf\" title=\"\">payment</a> or having public service content favoured by algorithms and promotional methods. </p> <p>In Washington DC last week the <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/washington-post-zeus-prime-advertising-8f356787-5f66-4fc2-9d34-a62516d4762d.html\" title=\"\">Washington Post unveiled an initiative</a> that is meant to compete with the advertising power of Google and Facebook. Keen observers will have noticed that the Post is owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, so there is at least room to interpret the launch of advertising platform, Zeus Prime, as being part of the growing influence of technology companies on news firms, rather than a bulwark against it.</p> <p>The Post\u2019s Jarrod Dicker told me the news company already has tens of publishers waiting to join the platform, and that the potential exists for them to improve the advertising revenue they get from automated programmatic sales to increase by as much as five times.</p> <p>The Post\u2019s heavy investment in software is unusual in the news business \u2013 most companies would struggle to employ 30 software engineers, let alone the 300 the Post has on its books. The hunt for a sustainable model for news in America stands in stark contrast to the government-led approach in the UK. Whilst initiatives such as the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-cairncross-review-a-sustainable-future-for-journalism\" title=\"\">Cairncross review </a>and the current Ofcom review of public broadcasting are busy carving out recommendations and institutional reforms, there is a notable and deliberate government policy void in the US.</p> <p>The constitutional separation of Congress from the free press is intentional and occasionally taken to the extreme, including spectating the near collapse of all local news holding companies and allowing a duopoly to dominate digital advertising.</p> <p>Stepping into the policy void in America are a mix of philanthropists, billionaires, foundations and, latterly, corporate sponsors, chiefly in the form of Google and Facebook both of whom have pledged to spend $100m each per year over the next three years on journalism initiatives.</p> <p>Last week the <a href=\"https://inn.org/innindex/\" title=\"\">annual index</a> from the Institute for Non-profit News (INN) also revealed that charitable support from individuals was growing. In 2018 individual giving made up 39% of revenues, and foundation support 43%, the first time that charitable foundations made up less than half of the total.</p> <p>The growth of non-profit news in the US has been one of the brightest spots for the media in a somewhat bleak landscape. Newsrooms have launched at the rate of roughly one a month over the past 12 years. But the vast majority of these newsrooms are tiny. The total membership of the INN employs around 3,000 journalists and has revenues of about $450m. This puts the total non-profit news journalism head count at about double that of the New York Times, and total revenues at slightly less than a quarter.</p> <p>The big five technology companies \u2013 Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon \u2013 spent a combined <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-22/google-set-2018-lobbying-record-as-washington-techlash-expands\" title=\"\">$64m on lobbyists in Washington alone last year</a>.</p> <p>In the coming year there are already signs it will be much tougher (were that possible) for the news industry. The New York Times closed its Spanish-language edition last week, and there are murmurs again of digital startup news organisations still struggling to make a profit. Bad news inevitably arrives in the autumn, as fourth quarter budgets and forecasting for 2020 make it clear to what extent businesses are sustainable.</p> <p>It is heartening to see that there is a great deal of policy energy and both corporate and civic concern for what comes next in news. It is also important to keep an eye on the jousting between the privately-funded initiatives, such as Project Neon, and the public policy developments such as Ofcom\u2019s forthcoming report on public service broadcasting.

      "bodyText": "Anyone who has passed through Cambridge recently (the one in the English countryside, not the one in Massachusetts),would have noticed that the ivory towers glint and sprawl with technological investment. \u201cSilicon Fen\u201d, as it is appropriately known, has been a key investment site for global technology companies wanting to tap into Cambridge University\u2019s research capacities. Google is one such company, and now it has an added interest in East Anglia as it is partnering with local news company Archant to create three digital newsrooms in communities \u201ccurrently underserved by news\u201d. The venture, Project Neon, looks very much a carbon copy of Project Compass in the US, where Google is also partnering with a large local news chain, McClatchy, to set up digital outlets in news deserts. The first Project Compass experiment will be based in Youngstown Ohio, where the local newspaper, The Vindicator, printed its final edition on 31 August. It had succumbed to the pressures of falling revenues caused by a shift in newspaper reading habits and by the migration of advertising revenues to principally Google and Facebook. The Neon Compass projects are fascinating in that they represent the most direct intervention to date of any technology company in providing news. Both Google and Facebook are spending about $100m (\u00a380m) a year each on journalism projects of a wide variety, but almost all of it is in grants or support to third parties. Stepping into the arena of building newsrooms alongside commercial news organisations \u2013 albeit to \u201cexperiment\u201d with new models \u2013 brings with it obvious questions about potential conflict of interest, as well as the possibility that the two decades of failing to fix local news will soon be at an end. This type of investment raises the theoretical, but not impossible, scenario that Archant newsrooms will be simultaneously working with Google, and reporting on the activities and investments of the company in East Anglia. If Google continues its charitable support for news projects this will be a dilemma editors are likely to face with increasing regularity. As if to make the point, the outgoing Ofcom head, Sharon White, addressed the issue of tech company dominance in remarks made (coincidentally) in Cambridge at the Royal Television Society conference last week, where she expressed the personal view that online platforms needed to step up their side of the \u201csocial contract\u201d and that one way or another contribute to the safeguarding of public service media, be it through payment or having public service content favoured by algorithms and promotional methods. In Washington DC last week the Washington Post unveiled an initiative that is meant to compete with the advertising power of Google and Facebook. Keen observers will have noticed that the Post is owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, so there is at least room to interpret the launch of advertising platform, Zeus Prime, as being part of the growing influence of technology companies on news firms, rather than a bulwark against it. The Post\u2019s Jarrod Dicker told me the news company already has tens of publishers waiting to join the platform, and that the potential exists for them to improve the advertising revenue they get from automated programmatic sales to increase by as much as five times. The Post\u2019s heavy investment in software is unusual in the news business \u2013 most companies would struggle to employ 30 software engineers, let alone the 300 the Post has on its books. The hunt for a sustainable model for news in America stands in stark contrast to the government-led approach in the UK. Whilst initiatives such as the Cairncross review and the current Ofcom review of public broadcasting are busy carving out recommendations and institutional reforms, there is a notable and deliberate government policy void in the US. The constitutional separation of Congress from the free press is intentional and occasionally taken to the extreme, including spectating the near collapse of all local news holding companies and allowing a duopoly to dominate digital advertising. Stepping into the policy void in America are a mix of philanthropists, billionaires, foundations and, latterly, corporate sponsors, chiefly in the form of Google and Facebook both of whom have pledged to spend $100m each per year over the next three years on journalism initiatives. Last week the annual index from the Institute for Non-profit News (INN) also revealed that charitable support from individuals was growing. In 2018 individual giving made up 39% of revenues, and foundation support 43%, the first time that charitable foundations made up less than half of the total. The growth of non-profit news in the US has been one of the brightest spots for the media in a somewhat bleak landscape. Newsrooms have launched at the rate of roughly one a month over the past 12 years. But the vast majority of these newsrooms are tiny. The total membership of the INN employs around 3,000 journalists and has revenues of about $450m. This puts the total non-profit news journalism head count at about double that of the New York Times, and total revenues at slightly less than a quarter. The big five technology companies \u2013 Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon \u2013 spent a combined $64m on lobbyists in Washington alone last year. In the coming year there are already signs it will be much tougher (were that possible) for the news industry. The New York Times closed its Spanish-language edition last week, and there are murmurs again of digital startup news organisations still struggling to make a profit. Bad news inevitably arrives in the autumn, as fourth quarter budgets and forecasting for 2020 make it clear to what extent businesses are sustainable. It is heartening to see that there is a great deal of policy energy and both corporate and civic concern for what comes next in news. It is also important to keep an eye on the jousting between the privately-funded initiatives, such as Project Neon, and the public policy developments such as Ofcom\u2019s forthcoming report on public service broadcasting. Call me a cynic but the two might just be related. Is it a coincidence that we are seeing an influx of cash into experiments to aid journalism at a time when there is pressure on the big tech companies in Europe, the UK and, should there be a change of administration in the US in 2020 perhaps there too. Democrat candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have both been clear they see a need to curtail their power, and the latter has laid out plans to tax them to fund non-corporate media.

      "bodyText": "Anyone expecting a blaze of colour evocative of sunny Spain and the fiery temperament of Bizet\u2019s femme fatale gets it in the brilliant hues of the front cloth, but for barely two minutes. With the first note of the ominous death theme, the apparently vibrant start to Welsh National Opera\u2019s new season gives way to a dismal scene. Director Jo Davies transposes the opera to Brazil circa the 1970s, ostensibly taking a feminist stance and posing the #MeToo question: why should Carmen have to die for the crime of being a rebellious free spirit, craving love yet refusing to be trapped by a man and caged? Leslie Travers\u2019 design has a curve of tiered galleries looking into a courtyard, creating a slummy favela of sorts, the elements of garrison guard, arms- and drug-smuggling and factory workers as though randomly imposed. It is possible to work out a vague rationale, but the scenario feels a contrivance, with layer upon layer of frenetic business supporting the concept but incidental to the music. Dance is another distraction: a female clad in black is the figure of death shadowing Carmen, taking attention away from focal dramatic moments, as when the cards predict what she already perceives as her inevitable demise. In the title role, Virginie Verrez is feisty, with an impressive vocal presence, her native French allowing the words to emerge clearly, though somehow falling short of being the personification of Carmen. Dmitri Pittas\u2019s Don Jos\u00e9 matches her in volume, but is too forceful of tone to elicit sympathy for his obsession, while Phillip Rhodes has the swagger to be an Escamillo plausible enough to merit the transfer of Carmen\u2019s attentions. WNO\u2019s musical director Tom\u00e1\u0161 Hanus ensures that the true passion flows from the pit, treating Bizet\u2019s wonderful instrumental lines with as much respect as those of the singers and arguing a case for the score to be heard as a prototype for the realism of verismo. But, ultimately, this is a staging where the directorial add-ons don\u2019t amount to an overall gain in the operatic experience. \u2022 At the Wales Millennium Centreon 28 September, 6/10 October. And touring.",

I\u2019m from Bulgaria and all my family were performers. We went all over the world together. It was the absolute best experience a child could ever have. So many different kinds of people, so much access to different cultures, and I could learn on the road and not at school. There were loads of kids around, too. Lots of the performers had children so we\u2019d all hang out together. I had friends from Mongolia, Russia and France. It was a family, really.</p> <p>My parents did a teeterboard act, and it was the most amazing thing. Then my older sister started doing a hula-hoop act. She was my hero. I wanted to be just like her. So I started learning how to do it. I really fell in love with it.</p> <p>I retired from being a touring circus performer five years ago. I moved to Las Vegas and now work as a technician at Cirque du Soleil. It was the right time to get off the road. I put my kids in regular school and bought a house. Then I brought my mum over from Bulgaria to live with us. But it was hard to adjust, knowing there wasn\u2019t going to be another town tomorrow.

It took me ages to work out how to spin it, and I had to bulk up \u2013 I needed more muscle. The hoop is as big as a house, so the problem is getting it off the ground and then spinning.</p> <p>One day I realised that I needed to be spinning in order to get it off the ground. I needed to make gravity work for me, not against me. It took me ages to work that out and I really had to get used to being dizzy.</p> <p>It was a proud moment when I broke the record, and even if someone comes along and breaks it, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll mind because they\u2019ll really deserve it.

I\u2019d watched The Karate Kid and I was a little bit in love with Ralph Macchio, so I went to a karate lesson and didn\u2019t like it at all. Then a friend suggested I try taekwondo and I fell in love with it at my first lesson. I knew then and there I wanted to become a European and world champion. Two years ago I went to China and became the first female master of taekwondo in England. I met Chris eight years ago. It\u2019s a good pairing. He\u2019s a crazy powerful man and I\u2019m a crazy powerful woman. I encouraged him to come along for a lesson. The Guinness World Records stuff didn\u2019t come until 2013. We were at an exhibition and needed something to entertain the kids, so we set up a little display and they went crazy for it. Chris had literally never done it until that day. Afterwards they all said: \u201cYou should go for a record!\u201d</p> <p><strong>Chris:</strong> We\u2019re really very competitive people. Even with each other, which is an interesting dynamic for a married couple. Whatever amount of tiles one of us puts up, the other wants to better it. We have fallen out over it. Even our friends and family often don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s all about. My sister is very, \u2018So you broke a brick, wow\u2026\u2019 I think a lot of people just don\u2019t understand the skill it takes \u2013 which is just fine by us.</p> <p><strong>Lisa:</strong> We\u2019ve hurt ourselves doing it. The first time we went for a record attempt we didn\u2019t have an adjudicator, so we set it all up ourselves. When you\u2019re smashing up 1,000 tiles, you don\u2019t realise the scale of it. How much room you need, how many tiles you actually need, because they don\u2019t all break. So on that attempt we actually ran out of tiles. It was complete carnage. I thought I\u2019d broken both my hands. Chris thought he\u2019d broken one of his. We ended up in A&amp;E, sobbing, thinking: \u201cOur dreams of being a Guinness World Record holder are over!\u201d In fact, we hadn\u2019t broken our hands. The nurse who gave us our X-rays was astonished and said: \u201cI think your hands are made of iron.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Chris:</strong> They know us down there now. It\u2019s a strange life. I often find myself out for a meal and my mind will start to wander. I\u2019ll see a table and I\u2019ll start thinking, \u201cI wonder if I could break that?\u201d It\u2019s always on our minds. It\u2019s our life, really.</p> <h2>\u2018My shed is only getting faster\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d8baa9e64dd77f8ef83bf019be2d3cc95bc3f9ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8baa9e64dd77f8ef83bf019be2d3cc95bc3f9ed/0_152_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"On the road again: Kevin Nicks in the fastest garden shed ever built.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On the road again: Kevin Nicks in the fastest garden shed ever built.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Michael Hughes/Guinness World Records</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Kevin Nicks, 54, South Yorkshire. Record: The fastest garden shed is 129.831kph (80.67mph), achieved by Kevin Nicks in Yorkshire on 16 September 2017</strong></p> <p>I had a car that I was going to scrap, but it was too good to throw away. My creation is built on an engineered steel framework, designed using 299 pages of rules from the DVLA, which allows it to drive on the roads. To date, the shed has covered 35,000 miles. While I was building it I found out there was already a record of 58mph for the fastest shed, which I thought I could better. Why do you want to drive a shed? Why not! I\u2019ve driven from Land\u2019s End to John O\u2019Groats, and have speed records at locations all over the UK and the Isle of Man.</p> <p>I\u2019ve always been interested in engineering and have a great understanding of anything mechanical. I worked in the renewable energy industry, and I\u2019m interested in the alternatives to vehicles. My mind is ticking over; I might build something rather special if I can secure the funding.</p> <p>If someone wanted to break the Guinness World Record for the fastest shed, it wouldn\u2019t be easy. Even if they didn\u2019t make one like mine, which is road legal, it would still have to pass the very strict rules that allow it to \u201crace\u201d. It has to be safe, which means it would need to hold together at speed. And my shed is only getting faster. I\u2019ve updated my vehicle. I think I might redo my record at some point.</p> <h2>\u2018As a kid, I was so scared of failing\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"eefd0c159a8df6942e4f1bae6a0a8b27b66fef02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eefd0c159a8df6942e4f1bae6a0a8b27b66fef02/0_201_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Right on target: Brittany Walsh shooting an arrow using only her feet.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Right on target: Brittany Walsh shooting an arrow using only her feet.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Ellerker/Guinness World Records</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Brittany Walsh, 32, Portland. Record: The farthest arrow shot using the feet only is 12.31m, achieved by Brittany Walsh at Creston School in Portland, Oregon, on 31 March 2018</strong></p> <p>It started as a dare. Flicking through an old book of pictures taken in the circus, we saw this woman firing an arrow with her feet. My friend dared me to try it and we went straight to a sporting goods store, bought a bow and arrow, and I realised: \u201cYeah, I could probably do this!\u201d What can I say? We didn\u2019t have Netflix at the time. You make your own fun.</p> <p>It didn\u2019t come completely out of the blue. I had competed in gymnastics as a kid, but I was very studious, I was very shy, quiet, not spontaneous at all. I felt like I had my life mapped out. Go to medical school. Become a doctor. Then I saw an advertisement for a local physical theatre company looking for tumblers. I went for an audition and they accepted me. I spoke to my parents about it and they were surprisingly supportive. They told me: \u201cSchool will always be there.\u2019\u201d I learned stilt-walking and trapeze. It really helped me find myself. And I did go back to school afterwards, too, so I\u2019ve had the best of both worlds.</p> <p>There was part of me that always wanted to try new stuff. I was so scared as a kid. Scared of looking stupid in front of people or failing, but the older you get the more you realise that stuff just doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is being happy, growing as a person and learning who you are. I\u2019ve realised that I\u2019m a thrill seeker. I like the excitement of doing new things. I\u2019d like to learn how to fly a small plane.

Now wherever I go I see the world in balloons. I\u2019m a father of six \u2013 we\u2019re expecting our seventh \u2013 and I started to entertain my kids. I\u2019m passionate about my children\u2019s development, so I was keen to learn new things and involve them. First I learned how to juggle. Then how to unicycle. Then I learned magic. But balloon modelling was the one that hooked me, because I was so terrible at it. I thrive on a challenge. I\u2019m one of five kids. I was, until I went bald, a short, ginger-haired boy. Nobody ever noticed me. I was the small dog with the big bone and I think just trying to be recognised made me throw myself at things. It was six years ago when I started doing this, and I broke the world record for the most models in the fastest time two years after that.</p> <p>I train every day. I spend between \u00a3500 and \u00a31,000 on balloons every month. I work with a data analyst. I\u2019ll get my kids to adjudicate and film me so I can watch what I\u2019m doing afterwards and think how I can change something to do it better and go faster: my posture, or my breathing. But everywhere I go I\u2019ll be making balloons. I might be waiting in the chip shop and see an old lady there and I\u2019ll make her a rose or something. People probably think I\u2019m the weird balloon guy, but I think I\u2019m putting something good into the world<em>.</em></p> <p><em>Guinness World Records 2020 has just been published at \u00a320.

The most pine boards broken in one minute with one hand (male) is 315, by Chris Pitman in Bromley on 9 April 2018. The fastest time to break 1,000 roof tiles by a male is 51.08 seconds, achieved by Chris in Bromley on 19 August 2013 Lisa: I started taekwondo when I was 15, so 30 years ago now. I\u2019d watched The Karate Kid and I was a little bit in love with Ralph Macchio, so I went to a karate lesson and didn\u2019t like it at all. Then a friend suggested I try taekwondo and I fell in love with it at my first lesson. I knew then and there I wanted to become a European and world champion. Two years ago I went to China and became the first female master of taekwondo in England. I met Chris eight years ago. It\u2019s a good pairing. He\u2019s a crazy powerful man and I\u2019m a crazy powerful woman. I encouraged him to come along for a lesson. The Guinness World Records stuff didn\u2019t come until 2013. We were at an exhibition and needed something to entertain the kids, so we set up a little display and they went crazy for it. Chris had literally never done it until that day. Afterwards they all said: \u201cYou should go for a record!\u201d Chris: We\u2019re really very competitive people. Even with each other, which is an interesting dynamic for a married couple. Whatever amount of tiles one of us puts up, the other wants to better it. We have fallen out over it. Even our friends and family often don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s all about. My sister is very, \u2018So you broke a brick, wow\u2026\u2019 I think a lot of people just don\u2019t understand the skill it takes \u2013 which is just fine by us. Lisa: We\u2019ve hurt ourselves doing it. The first time we went for a record attempt we didn\u2019t have an adjudicator, so we set it all up ourselves. When you\u2019re smashing up 1,000 tiles, you don\u2019t realise the scale of it. How much room you need, how many tiles you actually need, because they don\u2019t all break. So on that attempt we actually ran out of tiles. It was complete carnage. I thought I\u2019d broken both my hands. Chris thought he\u2019d broken one of his. We ended up in A&amp;E, sobbing, thinking: \u201cOur dreams of being a Guinness World Record holder are over!\u201d In fact, we hadn\u2019t broken our hands. The nurse who gave us our X-rays was astonished and said: \u201cI think your hands are made of iron.\u201d Chris: They know us down there now. It\u2019s a strange life. I often find myself out for a meal and my mind will start to wander. I\u2019ll see a table and I\u2019ll start thinking, \u201cI wonder if I could break that?\u201d It\u2019s always on our minds. It\u2019s our life, really. \u2018My shed is only getting faster\u2019 Kevin Nicks, 54, South Yorkshire. Record: The fastest garden shed is 129.831kph (80.67mph), achieved by Kevin Nicks in Yorkshire on 16 September 2017 I had a car that I was going to scrap, but it was too good to throw away. My creation is built on an engineered steel framework, designed using 299 pages of rules from the DVLA, which allows it to drive on the roads. To date, the shed has covered 35,000 miles. While I was building it I found out there was already a record of 58mph for the fastest shed, which I thought I could better. Why do you want to drive a shed? Why not! I\u2019ve driven from Land\u2019s End to John O\u2019Groats, and have speed records at locations all over the UK and the Isle of Man. I\u2019ve always been interested in engineering and have a great understanding of anything mechanical. I worked in the renewable energy industry, and I\u2019m interested in the alternatives to vehicles. My mind is ticking over; I might build something rather special if I can secure the funding. If someone wanted to break the Guinness World Record for the fastest shed, it wouldn\u2019t be easy. Even if they didn\u2019t make one like mine, which is road legal, it would still have to pass the very strict rules that allow it to \u201crace\u201d. It has to be safe, which means it would need to hold together at speed. And my shed is only getting faster. I\u2019ve updated my vehicle. I think I might redo my record at some point. \u2018As a kid, I was so scared of failing\u2019 Brittany Walsh, 32, Portland. Record: The farthest arrow shot using the feet only is 12.31m, achieved by Brittany Walsh at Creston School in Portland, Oregon, on 31 March 2018 It started as a dare. Flicking through an old book of pictures taken in the circus, we saw this woman firing an arrow with her feet. My friend dared me to try it and we went straight to a sporting goods store, bought a bow and arrow, and I realised: \u201cYeah, I could probably do this!\u201d What can I say? We didn\u2019t have Netflix at the time. You make your own fun. It didn\u2019t come completely out of the blue. I had competed in gymnastics as a kid, but I was very studious, I was very shy, quiet, not spontaneous at all. I felt like I had my life mapped out. Go to medical school. Become a doctor. Then I saw an advertisement for a local physical theatre company looking for tumblers. I went for an audition and they accepted me. I spoke to my parents about it and they were surprisingly supportive. They told me: \u201cSchool will always be there.\u2019\u201d I learned stilt-walking and trapeze. It really helped me find myself. And I did go back to school afterwards, too, so I\u2019ve had the best of both worlds. There was part of me that always wanted to try new stuff. I was so scared as a kid. Scared of looking stupid in front of people or failing, but the older you get the more you realise that stuff just doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is being happy, growing as a person and learning who you are. I\u2019ve realised that I\u2019m a thrill seeker. I like the excitement of doing new things. I\u2019d like to learn how to fly a small plane. Life offers so much stuff to do; why not dive right in? \u2018I see the world in balloons\u2019 Ryan Tracey, 38, Belfast. Record: The most modelling balloon sculptures made in one minute is 14, achieved by Ryan Tracey on the set of Blue Peter in Manchester on 7 September 2017 I never thought this would end up being what I did with my life. Now wherever I go I see the world in balloons. I\u2019m a father of six \u2013 we\u2019re expecting our seventh \u2013 and I started to entertain my kids. I\u2019m passionate about my children\u2019s development, so I was keen to learn new things and involve them. First I learned how to juggle. Then how to unicycle. Then I learned magic. But balloon modelling was the one that hooked me, because I was so terrible at it. I thrive on a challenge. I\u2019m one of five kids. I was, until I went bald, a short, ginger-haired boy. Nobody ever noticed me. I was the small dog with the big bone and I think just trying to be recognised made me throw myself at things. It was six years ago when I started doing this, and I broke the world record for the most models in the fastest time two years after that. I train every day. I spend between \u00a3500 and \u00a31,000 on balloons every month. I work with a data analyst. I\u2019ll get my kids to adjudicate and film me so I can watch what I\u2019m doing afterwards and think how I can change something to do it better and go faster: my posture, or my breathing. But everywhere I go I\u2019ll be making balloons. I might be waiting in the chip shop and see an old lady there and I\u2019ll make her a rose or something. People probably think I\u2019m the weird balloon guy, but I think I\u2019m putting something good into the world. Guinness World Records 2020 has just been published at \u00a320.

Scotland must have downloaded the Japanese version as three mistakes in their opening 25 minutes when they were in possession were converted into tries by their opponents and a 16-point interval deficit. They <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/mar/16/england-scotland-six-nations-match-report\" title=\"\">came back from nearly double that</a> against England at the end of this year\u2019s Six Nations at Twickenham, but there was never the remotest prospect of a repeat here, with Ireland at their meanest throughout.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe did not start with the energy, accuracy or aggression required to beat Ireland,\u201d said Townsend. When asked why, he had no explanation. A coach may have no control after his players have left the dressing room for the playing field, but Scotland started as if determined to live up to an ideal, paying little heed to the deteriorating conditions or the effectiveness of Ireland\u2019s defenders in closing down the outside-half Finn Russell.</p> \n<p>There was a telling statistic on an evening that left Ireland in control of the group and on course for a quarter-final against South Africa. The possession was roughly shared, 51-49 in Ireland\u2019s favour, but they kicked from hand more \u2013 43 compared with 33 \u2013 and they made 92 passes, compared with Scotland\u2019s 169. They played the conditions and their opponents \u2013 the reason they started the tournament at the head of the world rankings while Scotland were eighth.</p> \n<p>They were prompted by Conor Murray, who looked back to his sharpest after an injury-ravaged season. The manner in which he set up his side\u2019s bonus-point try 15 minutes into the second half defined the game: it was his maliciously weighted kick that Ryan Wilson spilled and when Jordan Larmour set up a ruck, Murray quickly spotted Andrew Conway had space on the right and passed to him with alacrity.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"12e8da1824ca6b030fda12293cddaa7e64d7b37e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/12e8da1824ca6b030fda12293cddaa7e64d7b37e/0_0_3500_2292/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rory Best (centre) is pushed over for an Irish score in the corner.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"655\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rory Best (centre) is pushed over for an Irish score in the corner in the first half.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Davy/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Scotland had started as if trying to emulate New Zealand here <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/21/new-zealand-south-africa-rugby-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">less than 24 hours before</a>, but when Duncan Taylor\u2019s pass to Sean Maitland on halfway went straight into touch after three minutes, Murray launched an attack before Ian Henderson\u2019s rampaging run took Ireland close to Scotland\u2019s line. A few snipes later, James Ryan forced his way over and the game had not reached the 10-minute mark when Grant Gilchrist lost the ball just inside Ireland\u2019s half and Larmour counterattacked.</p> \n<p>Ireland were awarded a penalty that they kicked to touch and Rory Best twisted his body under pressure from Wilson to somehow ground the ball. Scotland\u2019s possession had yielded two tries to their opponents and although Greig Laidlaw stemmed the flow with a penalty, almost immediately Finn Russell failed to find Tommy Seymour breaking into the line on his inside. Conway hacked on and forced Stuart Hogg to concede a five-metre scrum after the ball bounced off a post.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"8d5f91fa-b0fc-4570-8a77-18f1811ca05f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/b8FIaigm1qU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>CJ Stander set off from the base and after Peter O\u2019Mahony made another metre, Tadhg Furlong found a surprising gap between Jonny Gray and Stuart McInally to claim his side\u2019s third try, all scored by front-five forwards.

Ireland lost Bundee Aki and O\u2019Mahony to head injuries in the opening 26 minutes. They both failed their assessments six days before their side\u2019s second match against Japan.

      "bodyText": "The Scottish supporters who trudged out of the ground in the pouring rain wondering how an eagerly anticipated showdown against their Six Nations rivals turned into such a miserable letdown would not have been heartened to hear Gregor Townsend explain his players\u2019 no-show in what, for many of them, should have been the biggest match of their careers. Lesson one in the manual on how to beat Ireland is to cherish the ball. Scotland must have downloaded the Japanese version as three mistakes in their opening 25 minutes when they were in possession were converted into tries by their opponents and a 16-point interval deficit. They came back from nearly double that against England at the end of this year\u2019s Six Nations at Twickenham, but there was never the remotest prospect of a repeat here, with Ireland at their meanest throughout. \u201cWe did not start with the energy, accuracy or aggression required to beat Ireland,\u201d said Townsend. When asked why, he had no explanation. A coach may have no control after his players have left the dressing room for the playing field, but Scotland started as if determined to live up to an ideal, paying little heed to the deteriorating conditions or the effectiveness of Ireland\u2019s defenders in closing down the outside-half Finn Russell. There was a telling statistic on an evening that left Ireland in control of the group and on course for a quarter-final against South Africa. The possession was roughly shared, 51-49 in Ireland\u2019s favour, but they kicked from hand more \u2013 43 compared with 33 \u2013 and they made 92 passes, compared with Scotland\u2019s 169. They played the conditions and their opponents \u2013 the reason they started the tournament at the head of the world rankings while Scotland were eighth. They were prompted by Conor Murray, who looked back to his sharpest after an injury-ravaged season. The manner in which he set up his side\u2019s bonus-point try 15 minutes into the second half defined the game: it was his maliciously weighted kick that Ryan Wilson spilled and when Jordan Larmour set up a ruck, Murray quickly spotted Andrew Conway had space on the right and passed to him with alacrity. Scotland had started as if trying to emulate New Zealand here less than 24 hours before, but when Duncan Taylor\u2019s pass to Sean Maitland on halfway went straight into touch after three minutes, Murray launched an attack before Ian Henderson\u2019s rampaging run took Ireland close to Scotland\u2019s line. A few snipes later, James Ryan forced his way over and the game had not reached the 10-minute mark when Grant Gilchrist lost the ball just inside Ireland\u2019s half and Larmour counterattacked. Ireland were awarded a penalty that they kicked to touch and Rory Best twisted his body under pressure from Wilson to somehow ground the ball. Scotland\u2019s possession had yielded two tries to their opponents and although Greig Laidlaw stemmed the flow with a penalty, almost immediately Finn Russell failed to find Tommy Seymour breaking into the line on his inside. Conway hacked on and forced Stuart Hogg to concede a five-metre scrum after the ball bounced off a post. CJ Stander set off from the base and after Peter O\u2019Mahony made another metre, Tadhg Furlong found a surprising gap between Jonny Gray and Stuart McInally to claim his side\u2019s third try, all scored by front-five forwards. It was in effect the end of the match, and although Scotland tried to be more patient after the break and take play through phases, they lacked a ball-carrier in the mould of Stander or Henderson and still kept spilling passes. They lost their flanker Hamish Watson after 37 minutes when his right knee buckled as he was cleared out of a ruck by Ireland\u2019s two props and left the field in a buggy. Townsend hoped Watson would be scanned on Sunday night but his tournament looked over. Scotland have Magnus Bradbury in Tokyo on standby. Ireland lost Bundee Aki and O\u2019Mahony to head injuries in the opening 26 minutes. They both failed their assessments six days before their side\u2019s second match against Japan. Jonathan Sexton was taken off in the third quarter, when the game was won, but had not aggravated an old groin injury. Victory over Japan would all but guarantee Ireland finish at the top of the group with Samoa and Russia to come but Scotland face the prospect of having to defeat the hosts to make it to the last eight. Since their win against Ireland at Murrayfield in 1991, they have only once beaten a fellow tier-one nation in a group match: against Italy in 2007 \u2013 and then they needed their opponents to miss a late penalty. While they were not fancied to defeat Ireland, they were expected to make a game of it. Had they shown half as much zeal as the largely amateur Russia had against Japan on the opening night, it would have been something. \u201cDisappointed,\u201d said Townsend when asked how he felt. His side\u2019s supporters preferred something stronger.",

      "body": "<p>It was my fault. Sometimes I write glibly. I make an argument for myself and forget that people read it. It still surprises me, after 20 years of writing, to think that I have readers: that my internal monologue is out and about in the world. I do not think about them. If I did, I couldn\u2019t write anything.</p> <p>In June, I wrote <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/obese-mannequins-selling-women-dangerous-lie/\" title=\"\">a piece</a> about Nike\u2019s obese mannequin, which was displayed at the London flagship shop to publicise Nike\u2019s new willingness to sell clothes to overweight women. It makes me laugh now to think I insulted a mannequin \u2013 how, on that day in 2019, we came to discuss human rights for mannequins. I said it was a cynical doll from a cynical company that is no friend to women. I said that the normalisation of obesity frightens me, because I can see the outcome of addiction to sugar in myself. I said that the \u201cfat acceptance\u201d movement is an abyss of denial. I said the mannequin was \u201cgargantuan\u201d and \u201cheaving with fat\u201d. I said it might get diabetes \u2013 if it had flesh. I said that if it ran, it would ruin its inhuman knees.</p> <p>I am an addict: to alcohol, to nicotine, to sugar. And now I think that, because of this, I wrote about the doll with self-hatred. I was ill with alcoholism when I was young, and the worst thing was my denial. I conquered alcohol by hating what it made me with such ferocity I was too scared to drink again. But I never got anywhere with food. I am stuck on food. So I said I hated the doll.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I am an addict: to alcohol, to nicotine, to sugar</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The piece appeared on Sunday. By Monday morning it was trending on Twitter. A friend emailed to tell me this, as if it were happy news: but she is a comic with the all the oddness peculiar to the comic. I do not write for attention, which is what I was accused of. I think it is more accurate to say that I write to conceal myself \u2013 and this time I failed.</p> <p>It rolled around the world. It followed the sun. I was called fat-phobic in the <em><a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/fashion-beauty/article/3013970/plus-size-nike-mannequins-recognition-reality-or-obesity\" title=\"\">South China Morning Post</a></em> and elitist in the <em><a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/fashion/even-nike-s-size-16-mannequin-isn-t-safe-from-fat-shamers-1.3920838\" title=\"\">Irish Times</a></em>. I became a person who hated women. My Wikipedia entry was changed to \u201cTanya Gold is fat and fat-phobic.\u201d Within half a day I was an invented person, and that version of me, which I do not recognise, is more vivid than I am and will, I marvel, outlive any other version, no matter my future strivings. This invented person was fleshed out swiftly, like a doll, and this seemed, in retrospect, a suitable punishment. I was presumed to have opinions I have never held. A reply to a famous critic enclosed a list of inspirational mantras to protect against feminine self-hatred. I was presumed to be against all of them. If I wasn\u2019t, I would not make sense.</p> <p>If I am being honest, I should say that I do recognise the character that was made for me, as a new skin. It is the voice of my own addiction screaming at me, as it often does, but now with many voices. In that sense it is the worst thing I can imagine. I had been found out. I began to hate my own name.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I began to hate my own name</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My storm, though, was comparatively minor. I read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/15/publicly-shamed-jon-ronson-is-shame-necessary-jennifer-jacquet-review-think-before-you-tweet\" title=\"\">Jon Ronson\u2019s work</a> about internet-shaming for context and comfort. In 2013, a PR called Justine Sacco wrote from Heathrow as she prepared to board a plane to South Africa: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/22/pr-exec-fired-racist-tweet-aids-africa-apology\" title=\"\">\u201cGoing to Africa. Hope I don\u2019t get Aids. Just Kidding. I\u2019m white!\u201d</a> It was a bad joke. She later said she intended to \u201cmimic and mock what an actual racist, ignorant person would say of South Africa\u201d. It didn\u2019t matter. By the time she landed she was the number one trend on Twitter globally; there was an awful hashtag called #HasJustineLandedYet, designed to celebrate the annihilation of her name. She became a comforting scapegoat for every racist; and she was punished. She lost her job and, according to Ronson, she was devastated by it. And another example: in 2012, Lindsey Stone was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/21/internet-shaming-lindsey-stone-jon-ronson\" title=\"\">photographed</a> at the Arlington National Cemetery\u2019s Tomb of the Unknowns, pretending to scream and \u201cflip the bird\u201d by the \u201cSilence and Respect\u201d sign. She was fired; a scapegoat for everyone who has ever been insensitive.</p> <p>A famous Twitter storm shows how swiftly it can turn. In 2013, at a tech convention, a woman overheard a man making a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/magazine/how-one-stupid-tweet-ruined-justine-saccos-life.html\" title=\"\">bad joke</a> about \u201ca fictitious piece of hardware that has a really big dongle, a ridiculous dongle\u2026 It wasn\u2019t even conversation-level volume\u201d. The woman tweeted: \u201cNot cool. Jokes about\u2026 \u2018big\u2019 dongles right behind me.\u201d The man became a scapegoat for every misogynist in tech; he has three children and he lost his job. When hackers attacked her employer\u2019s website, the woman was fired, too. Ronson believes that, at their heart, Twitter storms signify a desire for acceptance. If Sacco is entirely bad, then, by condemning her, others are entirely good. It makes the tweeting people seem vulnerable, and that is comforting.</p> <p>Because Twitter is monomaniacal, almost no one defended me. Those who did \u2013 on the danger of obesity point, which flew away \u2013 received the same punishment. So what follows should not have surprised me. There is another Tanya Gold. She is an editor, and kindly; she sometimes forwards messages that have come to her in error, with wry comments. I wrote to her as it began: I\u2019m sorry for what is coming. She replied: OK. She posted a note saying she was not the Tanya Gold who wrote the article. One of her friends wrote a hashtag #NotTHATTanya. They condoled with her for the hate mail. I was baffled that she was allowed an emotional response to the hate mail, which was mine, but I was not. Still, it was funny, in retrospect, watching people who had tweeted at her, returning in the spirit of maiden aunts once they learned their error. They were sodden with manners. One even offered her work. I couldn\u2019t laugh at the time. I felt that the central narrative of my addiction \u2013 that I am two people, and one is good, and one is bad \u2013 had literally come to pass. Still, I was infamous.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Because Twitter is monomaniacal, almost no one defended me</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I turned on Radio 4 and they were talking about me. Piers Morgan asked me to come on <em>Good Morning Britain</em>, so he could teach me to be a good feminist, and I wept.</p> <p>In truth, I did not need my old name any more, because I had a new one: \u201cHere\u2019s a daily reminder,\u201d wrote one Twitter correspondent, \u201cthat you: you\u2019re a fucking cunt!!\u201d They wrote satirically, misogynists day-dreaming of sexual violence: \u201cFuck you, Tanya Gold. Eat a dick.\u201d Some people \u2013 women mostly \u2013 wrote to say they wanted to sit on my face.</p> <p>My subversion enabled all other subversion. A woman with the Twitter name Miss Lucy P changed her Twitter name to Tanya Gold\u2019s Husband (Who is Fat). Someone wrote: \u201cI HOPE YOU DIE OF HEART DISEASE! YOU FUCKING OBESE WHORE!!! DIE ALREADY!!! KILL YOUR FUCKING SELF!!! OBESE WHORE!!!\u201d This person is apparently a personal trainer. I replied, idly: \u201cWould you look after my son?\u201d \u201cBring your son to your grave,\u201d he replied. \u201cWould it,\u201d a woman asked, \u201cbe horrible if I had a wish that Tanya Gold\u2019s body turned up in a ditch somewhere?\u201d She is apparently a watercolourist.</p> <p>I knew that many of them were enjoying it; that I had provided an opportunity for them to express their goodness with minimal effort. A girl sent me a message: \u201cMy sister thinks ur [sic] a cunt.\u201d She attached a video of a woman \u2013 the sister? \u2013 jumping around and laughing, her hands over her face.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They seemed fascinated that I am fat</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>They seemed fascinated that I am fat and unearthed photographs to prove it, including many zoomed in on my crotch. It does make sense. If I am a \u201cfat cunt\u201d, I must have a byline picture.</p> <p>Many people did not read the piece. That would interfere with the purity of the rage, which is, quite clearly, a drug. After reading one long message, I understood that my correspondent had not actually read the article. \u201cThough I was unable to read the entirety of the article due to refusal from subscriping [sic] to X and its vast conceptual wrongs,\u201d she wrote: \u201cI would like to address my problem with your article.\u201d She then wrote a critique of an article she had not read, and which I had not written, and that is the most decadent thing I can imagine.</p> <p>I could ignore<em><strong> </strong></em>the worst abuse. I know it was not really about me as, in this particular situation, there was no me. It was about everyone who had ever hurt them, including themselves. It was projection; they were re-enacting what I had done to the doll upon me. So the painful ones were passive aggressive: \u201cSo I\u2019m urging you to please do better. Please. Reach out and listen to those in the community. Retract this article. Apologise. Make a donation to a group that helps protect human rights, including for those who are big.\u201d (They wanted money?) Some were so grandiose I should have been pleased: \u201c[Tanya is] Something to unite us after Brexit.\u201d But I wasn\u2019t. Rather, I felt there was nothing in me left to love. All in all it lasted 72 hours.</p> <p>\u201cI know how awful it is,\u201d a journalist wrote to me, \u201cbut they do go away. Twitter storms are like real storms. The bigger they are, the better the weather is afterwards.\u201d I recovered by searching for reality. I had become unreal, so I made something real. I wrote to a correspondent who had said: \u201cCan\u2019t you understand that the language you used suggests a disgust of fat people? If you cared about the health of these women you might have used more clinical language with statistics rather than the hyperbolic language you used.\u201d</p> <p>I replied that I thought my language was too vicious. She thanked me for listening. I said I was addicted to sugar. She said she had a serious condition that was not related to obesity, but that the doctors had almost missed because she is obese. And that was the ending: a conversation from which we both learned something and from which we parted courteously. Once I had reclaimed myself from my avatar I was no longer hateful, at least to myself. </p>",

If Sacco is entirely bad, then, by condemning her, others are entirely good. It makes the tweeting people seem vulnerable, and that is comforting. Because Twitter is monomaniacal, almost no one defended me. Those who did \u2013 on the danger of obesity point, which flew away \u2013 received the same punishment. So what follows should not have surprised me. There is another Tanya Gold. She is an editor, and kindly; she sometimes forwards messages that have come to her in error, with wry comments. I wrote to her as it began: I\u2019m sorry for what is coming. She replied: OK. She posted a note saying she was not the Tanya Gold who wrote the article. One of her friends wrote a hashtag #NotTHATTanya. They condoled with her for the hate mail. I was baffled that she was allowed an emotional response to the hate mail, which was mine, but I was not. Still, it was funny, in retrospect, watching people who had tweeted at her, returning in the spirit of maiden aunts once they learned their error. They were sodden with manners. One even offered her work. I couldn\u2019t laugh at the time. I felt that the central narrative of my addiction \u2013 that I am two people, and one is good, and one is bad \u2013 had literally come to pass. Still, I was infamous. I turned on Radio 4 and they were talking about me. Piers Morgan asked me to come on Good Morning Britain, so he could teach me to be a good feminist, and I wept. In truth, I did not need my old name any more, because I had a new one: \u201cHere\u2019s a daily reminder,\u201d wrote one Twitter correspondent, \u201cthat you: you\u2019re a fucking cunt!!\u201d They wrote satirically, misogynists day-dreaming of sexual violence: \u201cFuck you, Tanya Gold. Eat a dick.\u201d Some people \u2013 women mostly \u2013 wrote to say they wanted to sit on my face. My subversion enabled all other subversion. A woman with the Twitter name Miss Lucy P changed her Twitter name to Tanya Gold\u2019s Husband (Who is Fat). Someone wrote: \u201cI HOPE YOU DIE OF HEART DISEASE! YOU FUCKING OBESE WHORE!!! DIE ALREADY!!! KILL YOUR FUCKING SELF!!! OBESE WHORE!!!\u201d This person is apparently a personal trainer. I replied, idly: \u201cWould you look after my son?\u201d \u201cBring your son to your grave,\u201d he replied. \u201cWould it,\u201d a woman asked, \u201cbe horrible if I had a wish that Tanya Gold\u2019s body turned up in a ditch somewhere?\u201d She is apparently a watercolourist. I knew that many of them were enjoying it; that I had provided an opportunity for them to express their goodness with minimal effort. A girl sent me a message: \u201cMy sister thinks ur [sic] a cunt.\u201d She attached a video of a woman \u2013 the sister? \u2013 jumping around and laughing, her hands over her face. They seemed fascinated that I am fat and unearthed photographs to prove it, including many zoomed in on my crotch. It does make sense. If I am a \u201cfat cunt\u201d, I must have a byline picture. Many people did not read the piece. That would interfere with the purity of the rage, which is, quite clearly, a drug. After reading one long message, I understood that my correspondent had not actually read the article. \u201cThough I was unable to read the entirety of the article due to refusal from subscriping [sic] to X and its vast conceptual wrongs,\u201d she wrote: \u201cI would like to address my problem with your article.\u201d She then wrote a critique of an article she had not read, and which I had not written, and that is the most decadent thing I can imagine. I could ignore the worst abuse. I know it was not really about me as, in this particular situation, there was no me. It was about everyone who had ever hurt them, including themselves. It was projection; they were re-enacting what I had done to the doll upon me. So the painful ones were passive aggressive: \u201cSo I\u2019m urging you to please do better. Please. Reach out and listen to those in the community. Retract this article. Apologise. Make a donation to a group that helps protect human rights, including for those who are big.\u201d (They wanted money?) Some were so grandiose I should have been pleased: \u201c[Tanya is] Something to unite us after Brexit.\u201d But I wasn\u2019t. Rather, I felt there was nothing in me left to love. All in all it lasted 72 hours. \u201cI know how awful it is,\u201d a journalist wrote to me, \u201cbut they do go away. Twitter storms are like real storms. The bigger they are, the better the weather is afterwards.\u201d I recovered by searching for reality. I had become unreal, so I made something real. I wrote to a correspondent who had said: \u201cCan\u2019t you understand that the language you used suggests a disgust of fat people? If you cared about the health of these women you might have used more clinical language with statistics rather than the hyperbolic language you used.\u201d I replied that I thought my language was too vicious. She thanked me for listening. I said I was addicted to sugar. She said she had a serious condition that was not related to obesity, but that the doctors had almost missed because she is obese. And that was the ending: a conversation from which we both learned something and from which we parted courteously. Once I had reclaimed myself from my avatar I was no longer hateful, at least to myself.",

I\u2019m glad the gold toilet exists (or existed) and I\u2019m glad it was stolen. After all, if it hadn\u2019t been stolen, I probably wouldn\u2019t know it exists. I\u2019m also glad it was stolen from Blenheim Palace, that colossally vulgar stately home, because it\u2019s exactly the kind of place you imagine might have gold toilets.</p> \n<p>It only slightly spoils it that it doesn\u2019t. The loos at Blenheim are, as far as I know, made from conventional materials. The gold loo, as well as being a loo, is a work of conceptual art and was part of an exhibition of other works of art that weren\u2019t also loos, or also gold.

      "body": "<p>Composed of a historic patchwork of colleges, Oxford is a unique urban ecosystem. Its basic building block is the quad, a hangover from the medieval era when learning was conducted in monasteries. College chapels and dining halls with their associated rituals are similarly beholden. \u201cEat, pray, study\u201d was Oxford\u2019s original raison d\u2019\u00eatre. Within this network, <a href=\"https://www.sjc.ox.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">St John\u2019s College</a>, founded in 1555, is one of the more powerful players, both academically and fiscally. It was said that you could walk from Oxford to London on land owned by St John\u2019s. Alumni include Philip Larkin, Kingsley Amis and Tony Blair.</p> <p>Typical of Oxford colleges, St John\u2019s evolved slowly and incrementally, to the point where it now contains a neat potted history of English architecture from the 16th century to the present day. The impetus to shape and express the college\u2019s sense of identity through its buildings has spawned a catholic assemblage that encompasses such strange bedfellows as the luxuriantly baroque concerto of Canterbury Quadrangle, built by William Laud, the Anglican archbishop of Canterbury under Charles I, who fell foul of the treacherous currents of Jacobean politics and was executed in 1645, and the conspicuously modernist Beehive building, which has a literal (and radical) honeycomb plan. Designed in 1960 by Michael Powers of the Architects\u2019 Co-Partnership, it was the first genuinely modern building to be constructed by any Oxford college and move away from the popular perception that the place is preserved in aspic.</p> <p>Today, this forward-looking patronage, both architecturally and in efforts to challenge elitist stereotyping, continues under Maggie Snowling, St John\u2019s current president, with outreach activities to schools in marginalised areas, scholarship programmes and free summer schools. The latest addition to the college corpus, a new <a href=\"https://www.sjc.ox.ac.uk/discover/about-college/new-library-and-study-centre/\" title=\"\">library and </a><a href=\"https://www.sjc.ox.ac.uk/discover/about-college/new-library-and-study-centre/\" title=\"\">study </a><a href=\"https://www.sjc.ox.ac.uk/discover/about-college/new-library-and-study-centre/\" title=\"\">centre</a> designed by the London-based partnership of <a href=\"https://www.wrightandwright.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Wright &amp; Wright Architects</a> is also conspicuously modern, reframing the human need for learning in peace and quiet.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f745cb34e8418236fb0fddac25d6ebff1112f19\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f745cb34e8418236fb0fddac25d6ebff1112f19/0_0_5810_6643/875.jpg\" alt=\"The light-filled library, a social as well as an academic hub\" width=\"875\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The light-filled library, a social as well as an academic hub.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hufton &amp; Crow</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The library has always been at the heart of St John\u2019s, and over time its holdings have grown into a significant body of precious manuscripts, printed books and personal papers. Highlights include Jane Austen\u2019s letters, a second edition of Chaucer\u2019s <em>Canterbury Tales</em>, and collections owned by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/aug/12/robert-graves-great-war-poet-to-goodbye-to-all-that-by-jean-moorcroft-wilson-review\" title=\"\">Robert Graves</a>, AE Housman and Spike Milligan, among others. These are now sequestered in the new study centre\u2019s subterranean archive, while a reading room spread over three levels has space for 120 scholars, augmenting the college\u2019s two historic libraries in Canterbury Quad.</p> <p>Adding to St John\u2019s centuries-old conglomeration presented the familiar challenge of impinging as lightly as possible on the site and existing structures. Sandwiched between the president\u2019s garden and an ancient boundary wall, the new building had to be introverted as direct views were not permitted into the president\u2019s garden, to preserve privacy. Such proscriptions might have deterred or derailed flashier architects, but Wright &amp; Wright have turned the provocation of designing an essentially blank-walled building into a subtle feat of artistry and invention. Conceived as a casket of stone pierced by light, the study centre eases gently into the bucolic college landscape, a sober and circumspect modern interloper.</p> <p>Disdaining the veneered slickness of stick-on cladding that is a convenient panacea for many architects, Wright &amp; Wright embrace a culture of what they describe as \u201cthick-skinned\u201d buildings. \u201cWe are drawn to heavy, earthbound materials, especially stone and brick,\u201d says Sandy Wright. \u201cWe like the idea that space is almost organically carved out of solid masonry in the manner of a thick-walled castle keep.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd46b75e22af534d3a60d91ec80b80f7c8d7d973\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd46b75e22af534d3a60d91ec80b80f7c8d7d973/0_0_6599_6615/998.jpg\" alt=\"The exterior carved bas-relief, in Clipsham stone, by Susanna Heron.\" width=\"998\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The exterior carved bas-relief, in Clipsham stone, by Susanna Heron.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hufton &amp; Crow</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the side facing the president\u2019s garden, walls of creamy Clipsham stone are embellished both inside and out by a carved bas-relief by the sculptor <a href=\"http://susannaheron.com/\" title=\"\">Susanna Heron</a>. The concept of ornamented stone was inspired by the figurative carvings in the adjacent Canterbury Quad. Heron\u2019s abstract interpretation flows sumptuously across the irregular grid of the stone wall, perpetually changing as the sun strikes it, as if the wall is somehow alive. A shallow reflecting pool around its base also catches the light, casting a fugitive lustre on to the rippling surface. While swimming in Hampstead ladies\u2019 pond, Clare Wright was struck by how light refracted by water on to stone generates shimmering caustic reflections. This prompted an exploration into how solid matter could be animated by the play of texture and light, underscoring the collaboration with Heron.</p> <p>As well as the interaction of light and materials, ideas about thresholds, connections and the relationship between old and new coalesce to define and enrich the building. The study centre is both an end in itself and a component in a larger formal and spatial sequence that activates fresh ways of experiencing the college. The building creates an active connection between Canterbury Quad and the more modern elements of the college to the north, strengthening links between different eras.</p> <p>While on the president\u2019s garden side only oblique views are permitted of the landscape through a series of vertical slots, like arrow slits in a castle fortification, on the other side the upper floor lifts up and peers over the existing boundary wall to the college\u2019s great lawn. Here, the building presents a different spectacle: a long, glazed vitrine cradled within the embrace of its heavy stone container. Openings capture and frame specific views, choreographing a series of vignettes as you move through the interior.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"05fb6b8884cf65a9b3cdb68bc38faa3dcd55fc93\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05fb6b8884cf65a9b3cdb68bc38faa3dcd55fc93/0_0_4189_6394/655.jpg\" alt=\"Susanna Heron\u2019s bas-relief continues inside\" width=\"655\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Susanna Heron\u2019s bas-relief continues inside, \u2018perpetually changing as the sun strikes it\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hufton &amp; Crow</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At St John\u2019s, as elsewhere, the shift from print to digital media continues to impact on habits of library use, but despite repeated jeremiads concerning the death of the book, there remains a need to engage with actual objects. Rather than cancelling each other out, print and digital technologies have achieved a kind of symbiosis that still requires physical anchoring and embodiment. This is especially true of a college library, which is a social as well as an academic hub. With its intimate, human-scaled landscape of specially designed study carrels, desks and bookshelves, the reading room in the study centre is an environment that the college\u2019s monastic forebears might recognise, albeit now equipped with laptops and wifi.</p> <p>Poetry is combined with pragmatism, as the study centre incorporates a number of passive environmental control measures designed to reduce its energy consumption, with an emphasis on natural ventilation and daylighting. Heating is provided by water from ground-source boreholes, and photovoltaic panels on the roof contribute to electricity generation. Such measures are designed to fully offset the building\u2019s carbon emissions to achieve a carbon neutral status.</p> <p>The notion of depth resonates throughout Wright &amp; Wright\u2019s work. Most obviously and explicitly, it is expressed through thick walls, complex sections and earthbound materials, but it also reflects the practice\u2019s deeply held belief in the social purpose of architecture. And in an age when architects are increasingly content to churn out generic details and cede control to contractors, Wright &amp; Wright have a reputation for being deft and thoughtful builders. With St John\u2019s the outcome of this skill is palpable, the difference between a bespoke suit and a more disposable off-the-peg number. Of course, St John\u2019s can afford to opt for bespoke, but as custodians of an institution that is 464 years old, there is an imperative to see beyond the current era and build for an as yet unimaginable future.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Composed of a historic patchwork of colleges, Oxford is a unique urban ecosystem. Its basic building block is the quad, a hangover from the medieval era when learning was conducted in monasteries. College chapels and dining halls with their associated rituals are similarly beholden. \u201cEat, pray, study\u201d was Oxford\u2019s original raison d\u2019\u00eatre. Within this network, St John\u2019s College, founded in 1555, is one of the more powerful players, both academically and fiscally. It was said that you could walk from Oxford to London on land owned by St John\u2019s. Alumni include Philip Larkin, Kingsley Amis and Tony Blair. Typical of Oxford colleges, St John\u2019s evolved slowly and incrementally, to the point where it now contains a neat potted history of English architecture from the 16th century to the present day. The impetus to shape and express the college\u2019s sense of identity through its buildings has spawned a catholic assemblage that encompasses such strange bedfellows as the luxuriantly baroque concerto of Canterbury Quadrangle, built by William Laud, the Anglican archbishop of Canterbury under Charles I, who fell foul of the treacherous currents of Jacobean politics and was executed in 1645, and the conspicuously modernist Beehive building, which has a literal (and radical) honeycomb plan. Designed in 1960 by Michael Powers of the Architects\u2019 Co-Partnership, it was the first genuinely modern building to be constructed by any Oxford college and move away from the popular perception that the place is preserved in aspic. Today, this forward-looking patronage, both architecturally and in efforts to challenge elitist stereotyping, continues under Maggie Snowling, St John\u2019s current president, with outreach activities to schools in marginalised areas, scholarship programmes and free summer schools. The latest addition to the college corpus, a new library and study centre designed by the London-based partnership of Wright &amp; Wright Architects is also conspicuously modern, reframing the human need for learning in peace and quiet. The library has always been at the heart of St John\u2019s, and over time its holdings have grown into a significant body of precious manuscripts, printed books and personal papers. Highlights include Jane Austen\u2019s letters, a second edition of Chaucer\u2019s Canterbury Tales, and collections owned by Robert Graves, AE Housman and Spike Milligan, among others. These are now sequestered in the new study centre\u2019s subterranean archive, while a reading room spread over three levels has space for 120 scholars, augmenting the college\u2019s two historic libraries in Canterbury Quad. Adding to St John\u2019s centuries-old conglomeration presented the familiar challenge of impinging as lightly as possible on the site and existing structures. Sandwiched between the president\u2019s garden and an ancient boundary wall, the new building had to be introverted as direct views were not permitted into the president\u2019s garden, to preserve privacy. Such proscriptions might have deterred or derailed flashier architects, but Wright &amp; Wright have turned the provocation of designing an essentially blank-walled building into a subtle feat of artistry and invention. Conceived as a casket of stone pierced by light, the study centre eases gently into the bucolic college landscape, a sober and circumspect modern interloper. Disdaining the veneered slickness of stick-on cladding that is a convenient panacea for many architects, Wright &amp; Wright embrace a culture of what they describe as \u201cthick-skinned\u201d buildings. \u201cWe are drawn to heavy, earthbound materials, especially stone and brick,\u201d says Sandy Wright. \u201cWe like the idea that space is almost organically carved out of solid masonry in the manner of a thick-walled castle keep.\u201d On the side facing the president\u2019s garden, walls of creamy Clipsham stone are embellished both inside and out by a carved bas-relief by the sculptor Susanna Heron. The concept of ornamented stone was inspired by the figurative carvings in the adjacent Canterbury Quad. Heron\u2019s abstract interpretation flows sumptuously across the irregular grid of the stone wall, perpetually changing as the sun strikes it, as if the wall is somehow alive. A shallow reflecting pool around its base also catches the light, casting a fugitive lustre on to the rippling surface. While swimming in Hampstead ladies\u2019 pond, Clare Wright was struck by how light refracted by water on to stone generates shimmering caustic reflections. This prompted an exploration into how solid matter could be animated by the play of texture and light, underscoring the collaboration with Heron. As well as the interaction of light and materials, ideas about thresholds, connections and the relationship between old and new coalesce to define and enrich the building. The study centre is both an end in itself and a component in a larger formal and spatial sequence that activates fresh ways of experiencing the college. The building creates an active connection between Canterbury Quad and the more modern elements of the college to the north, strengthening links between different eras. While on the president\u2019s garden side only oblique views are permitted of the landscape through a series of vertical slots, like arrow slits in a castle fortification, on the other side the upper floor lifts up and peers over the existing boundary wall to the college\u2019s great lawn. Here, the building presents a different spectacle: a long, glazed vitrine cradled within the embrace of its heavy stone container. Openings capture and frame specific views, choreographing a series of vignettes as you move through the interior. At St John\u2019s, as elsewhere, the shift from print to digital media continues to impact on habits of library use, but despite repeated jeremiads concerning the death of the book, there remains a need to engage with actual objects. Rather than cancelling each other out, print and digital technologies have achieved a kind of symbiosis that still requires physical anchoring and embodiment. This is especially true of a college library, which is a social as well as an academic hub. With its intimate, human-scaled landscape of specially designed study carrels, desks and bookshelves, the reading room in the study centre is an environment that the college\u2019s monastic forebears might recognise, albeit now equipped with laptops and wifi. Poetry is combined with pragmatism, as the study centre incorporates a number of passive environmental control measures designed to reduce its energy consumption, with an emphasis on natural ventilation and daylighting. Heating is provided by water from ground-source boreholes, and photovoltaic panels on the roof contribute to electricity generation. Such measures are designed to fully offset the building\u2019s carbon emissions to achieve a carbon neutral status. The notion of depth resonates throughout Wright &amp; Wright\u2019s work. Most obviously and explicitly, it is expressed through thick walls, complex sections and earthbound materials, but it also reflects the practice\u2019s deeply held belief in the social purpose of architecture. And in an age when architects are increasingly content to churn out generic details and cede control to contractors, Wright &amp; Wright have a reputation for being deft and thoughtful builders. With St John\u2019s the outcome of this skill is palpable, the difference between a bespoke suit and a more disposable off-the-peg number. Of course, St John\u2019s can afford to opt for bespoke, but as custodians of an institution that is 464 years old, there is an imperative to see beyond the current era and build for an as yet unimaginable future.",

      "body": "<p>Cor, Russell Tovey\u2019s apartment is gorgeous! A New York-style warehouse-style place, with wooden floors, big windows at front and back, two light-filled bedrooms and enough space in the living-dining-hanging-out area for an army of cool cats to swing. But it\u2019s not the flat itself that dazzles, fabulous though it is. It\u2019s the art.</p> <p>As soon as you walk in, you notice it. On every wall there are canvases \u2013 huge, brightly coloured abstracts, delicate etchings, cartoon-like figures in spray paint and oils. Sculptures nestle in alcoves or stand proud on tables. One piece \u2013 a chair in the guest bedroom by Jessi Reaves \u2013 is only recognisable as art because it\u2019s so tatty when compared to the rest of the furnishings. (\u201cMost of my friends hate that one,\u201d Tovey laughs. \u201cThey think it looks like it was found in a skip.\u201d) How much art does he own? He counts up in his head: \u201cAbout 250 pieces,\u201d he says. A lot of it is in storage.</p> <p>Well known as an actor \u2013 one of the original <em>History Boys</em>, <em>Being Human</em> and most recently, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/14/years-and-years-review-a-glorious-near-future-drama-from-russell-t-davies\" title=\"\">the amazing </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/14/years-and-years-review-a-glorious-near-future-drama-from-russell-t-davies\" title=\"\">Years and Years</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/14/years-and-years-review-a-glorious-near-future-drama-from-russell-t-davies\" title=\"\"> </a>\u2013 Tovey has another, less-documented life. He is an absolute, stone-cold art buff: a self-taught specialist, a taste-making collector, an art \u201cgeek\u201d. Geek is the word he usually uses about himself when on <em><a href=\"https://play.acast.com/s/talkart\" title=\"\">Talk Art</a></em>, the podcast he hosts with gallery director Robert Diament; though he could equally call himself an enthusiast. He adores contemporary art, and his passion, over the years, has led him to expertise. He hosts special in-house tours in his apartment for high-up people such as patrons of the Royal Academy and is a guest curator for <a href=\"https://www.margatefestival.org/\" title=\"\">Margate NOW</a>, an art festival created to celebrate this year\u2019s Turner prize being held in the town.</p> <p>From 28 September until 13 October Margate is being taken over by art: as well as the Turner prize, there will be performances and screenings, pieces placed in unexpected places, work that only lasts a few days, and other works that have been months in the making. Five hundred artists and performers making more than 60 events in total, most involving Margate citizens. Yuri Suzuki, a local artist, has created 12 horns representing 12 sections of Kent that will broadcast songs and tales sung and told by locals. Open School East has been busy working with Margate kids, as has 1927, a theatre company. Tovey \u2013 who recently bought a flat in Margate \u2013 is excited. \u201cCulture automatically raises the status of a place and raises its quality,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd culture is something that brings people together. That\u2019s the whole point, because it\u2019s about humans communicating with other humans about what it is to be alive.\u201d </p> <p>I am interested in all this of course but I am far more intrigued by Tovey\u2019s flat. Can we look around? Tovey gives me an info-packed tour. It\u2019s noticeable that he mostly chooses to highlight the female artists in his collection. The first piece he ever bought, with his cheque from the film version of <em>The History Boys</em>, was a Tracey Emin etching, and he has always made a point of buying women\u2019s art: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/may/09/bish-bash-bosh-how-phyllida-barlow-conquered-the-art-world-at-73\" title=\"\">Phyllida Barlow</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/oct/11/rebecca-warren-review-tate-st-ives-all-that-heaven-allows\" title=\"\">Rebecca Warren</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/dec/03/rose-wylie-quack-quack-review-serpentine-sackler-gallery\" title=\"\">Rose Wylie</a>, who he worships. He has a lot by older artists, including the 90-year-old Venezuelan Magdalena Suarez Frimkess, who works in Venice, California; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/dec/31/carmen-herrera-men-controlled-everything-art\" title=\"\">Carmen Herrera</a>, who is 104; Etel Adnan, from Beirut, in her 90s. He likes supporting female artists because he feels they have a tougher time than their male counterparts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fe5ab77cc14cc50ff81b526991f11db9f12d9acc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe5ab77cc14cc50ff81b526991f11db9f12d9acc/0_54_1483_890/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Orlando by Toyin Ojih Odutola\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Orlando by Toyin Ojih Odutola</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy the artist and Jack Shainman Gallery, New York</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We spend some time admiring a gorgeous work by African American artist Toyin Ojih Odutola, who, says Tovey, \u201ccreates this fantasy of these fantastical Nigerian families in images that you would normally see in white depictions of royal families. And these families have been joined by their gay sons. So it\u2019s really imagining something that probably is never possible in Nigeria, but every one of these characters has their own story and their own place within these families.\u201d</p> <p>He has a couple of Joyce Pensatos on display. A few months ago, he and Diament interviewed Pensato, maker of scary-drip versions of classic cartoon figures and comic book heroes. She died of pancreatic cancer in June, aged 77. Tovey had collected her art for a while, and they\u2019d become friends: she requested that her last interview be for Tovey\u2019s podcast.</p> <p>In just over a year, they\u2019ve made 30-plus <em>Talk Art</em> programmes including lively interviews with artists \u2013 Ryan Gander and Rose Wylie \u2013 or art-friendly people (often actors) such as Zawe Ashton and Lena Dunham, and art world heavyweights \u2013 the Serpentine\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/may/27/on-my-radar-hans-ulrich-obrist-cultural-highlights-ian-cheng-emma-kunz-kamasi-washington\" title=\"\">Hans Ulrich Obrist</a>, gallery owner Sadie Coles and the director of Turner Contemporary, Victoria Pomery. The podcasts are gossipy and fun, engaging and well researched. The point, says Tovey, is to make a podcast about serious art that is approachable, that anyone can listen to.</p> <p>Tour done, we settle down for a chat at Tovey\u2019s big kitchen table. As we talk, I am struck by how different he is to most actors I\u2019ve met. Not only because of his passion for art, but because of his steady self-confidence. Most actors are insecure (understandable, given their profession), and deliberately sparkle for interviewers. Tovey is charming, friendly company, but he\u2019s also robust. Not desperate to make me like him (though I do). The main feeling I get from him is determination.</p> <p>I tell him he seems like the kind of person that has an idea and then absolutely commits to following it through. \u201cI am,\u201d he says. \u201cMy mum says that I\u2019m blinkered, and if I want something I get it. I think it comes from enthusiasm and I\u2019ve never apologised for being enthusiastic. When I want to know about something \u2013 ie art \u2013 I want to know everything. I have to know everything about it.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Sensation exhibition blew my mind. It felt like something had shifted. It was my Woodstock moment</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When he was a kid, growing up in Billericay and Romford, Essex, Tovey used to collect stuff. Rocks, minerals, fossils, coins, stamps, phone cards. One day he realised he had to streamline his life, so he got rid: sold his coins to one of the coin shops opposite the British Museum, put the phone cards on eBay. He was good at art himself \u2013 he still draws, mostly cute cartoons of himself for his boyfriend, Steve Brockman, or of their three dogs \u2013 and he was \u201cvisually stimulated\u201d as a child, buying comics featuring Ren and Stimpy, Beavis and Butthead, Rocko\u2019s Modern Life, and watching <em>Rugrats</em>. It wasn\u2019t such a big leap from those to Roy Lichtenstein, Keith Haring, Andy Warhol, Mel Ramos, Patrick Caulfield. But the big \u201caha\u201d moment was when he went to see the YBA Sensation show, in 1997, when he\u2019d just turned 16 (he\u2019s nearly 38 now). \u201cIt blew my mind,\u201d he says. \u201cIt felt like something had shifted. People say, ooh, the swinging 60s, and I\u2019m always like: \u2018OK, cool\u2019\u2026 Sensation was my Woodstock moment.\u201d</p> <p>He went back home in a daze, and, when required by his sixth form college, Barking College, to make a speech as part of an assignment, he did one about the importance of contemporary art. He got a pig\u2019s ear from a pet shop and put it in a tank of water to explain Damien Hirst (he called it Sow Memory). He found a bit of glass and passed it round his class, asking everyone what it made them think of. \u201cThat was my Duchamp, my ready-made.\u201d He got a distinction. \u201cBut that was the only award I got. They chucked me out after a year.\u201d</p> <p>They chucked him out because he didn\u2019t take up a role in the college play; having been working as an actor since he was 11, he\u2019d landed some paid work and did that instead. Soon after, he started at the National Theatre, and got a life-changing part in Alan Bennett\u2019s <em>The History Boys</em>. He made friends with Emin when the play was up for a South Bank award. At the party afterwards, they got on so well that she subsequently asked him to be her plus one at various dos. \u201cIt was during her miaowing phase,\u201d he recalls. Now Emin has moved into her imperial era, they remain excellent friends.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ada9659786733c294b48e4d1687ec81a6da00aa9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ada9659786733c294b48e4d1687ec81a6da00aa9/0_75_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tovey with T\u2019Nia Miller in Years and Years.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tovey with T\u2019Nia Miller in Years and Years.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Red Productions/Guy Farrow</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In fact, she gave him a discount on that first ever art purchase; he got together the money but was then shocked that he had to find 17.5% more (the VAT rate back then). Now, he\u2019s savvy enough to buy much of his art in the US, so he only pays 5% import tax, as opposed to 20% VAT. He started buying work over there when he was cast in a big HBO series, <em>Looking</em>, in 2013, and in later US-based series such as <em>Quantico</em>.</p> <p>How does he find the art he likes? Initially, he says, he used art advisers; but not for long. Advisers are usually there to find the work that will make the buyer the most money, and that\u2019s not why Tovey is buying art. He wants to support emerging artists, to look after work he considers important. He has ideals. \u201cContemporary art, especially, is all about the moment. The artist is trying to tell their story. So I feel like if you buy art, you\u2019re part of the dialogue about history, and you\u2019re contributing a little bit, by looking after it, to all these stories that are going to live for ever. Art is for everyone and outlives you.\u201d</p> <p>So now he finds the art himself. If he sees something he likes in a gallery, he will email: \u201cI always say, I\u2019m a London-based actor and collector, because some artists like being collected by an actor.\u201d He occasionally buys in auctions: \u201cI love it. But if you don\u2019t win, you do feel like you\u2019re being told off by the gavel.\u201d And he uses social media.</p> <p>\u201cThe magic of Instagram,\u201d he says. \u201cWith emerging artists, if you post a picture of their work or you comment on it, if you \u2018at\u2019 them, they normally contact you. Or you can direct message them and be like: \u2018Hey!\u2019 I\u2019ve done this so many times where I\u2019ve been in the States. I say: \u2018Where are you?\u2019 And they\u2019re like: \u2018In Brooklyn\u2019, and I say: \u2018Can I come do a studio visit?\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"63f6fec3384d13af8568913d84c58c1f3c9fa922\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63f6fec3384d13af8568913d84c58c1f3c9fa922/0_175_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A visitor poses with artist Joyce Pensato\u2019s Mickey for Micky at the 2014 Frieze Fair in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A visitor poses with artist Joyce Pensato\u2019s Mickey for Micky at the 2014 Frieze Fair in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luke Macgregor/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He understands and cultivates his own taste: \u201cI oscillate between figurative, cartoony abstraction and geometric abstractions.\u201d (Is there anything he doesn\u2019t like? He thinks: \u201cGerhard Richter\u2019s squidgy paintings. I just fucking hate them. They make me really angry. I think they\u2019re shit.\u201d)</p> <p>These days, friends ask him to be their art advisers. James Corden, another of the first History Boys, has been in touch, asking for advice: \u201cJames messaged me the other day, and I\u2019ve got him buying work. He\u2019s got loads of money now, so he\u2019s like: \u2018What should I do?\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Buy art!\u2019 So he\u2019s running stuff by me and I\u2019m like: \u2018No, don\u2019t do that, how about this?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>When he\u2019s not working, Tovey\u2019s researching art, disappearing into internet wormholes. It\u2019s how he relaxes. He re-educates himself constantly. He used to have a problem with video and sound-based work, partly because he looked at art as a collector. But now he\u2019s into it. \u201cMy medium of choice has always been painting, works on paper and sculpture. I saw video and sound art as not so important. But now I\u2019m like, \u201cNo.\u201d Because it\u2019s all about connecting and experience. And being immersive. And what\u2019s more immersive than that?\u201d</p> <p>Can he understand that some people find art difficult? \u201cYes,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you just have not to be intimidated by it. Go to a museum, you\u2019re going to see a thousand works of art. And if you find one you like and spend time in front of it, on some low level, molecularly, it will change you. That moment of culture.\u201d</p> <p>He gets cross about bad art, as he does about all bad culture. He has a little rant about rubbish plays: \u201cImagine someone going to see a play for the first time, and they\u2019ve saved up their money, and they get dressed up, and they get a train to London. And they have lunch before, all excited\u2026 and it\u2019s crap. And afterwards, they don\u2019t want to badmouth the play, they just assume that because they saw it on stage, it\u2019s got to be good. But fundamentally, inside them, they know it\u2019s not. That makes me sad.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d04c6038908af854990f0c1d343edd23cd14c9e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d04c6038908af854990f0c1d343edd23cd14c9e4/0_0_2800_1873/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tovey with Jamie Parker in The History Boys at the National Theatre in 2004.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tovey with Jamie Parker in The History Boys at the National Theatre in 2004.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This leads us, naturally, to his acting career. Tovey has a film to promote. <em>The Good Liar,</em> out on 8 November, stars Ian McKellen and Helen Mirren and is \u201ca con-rom romcom\u201d. Tovey plays Mirren\u2019s son and he loved doing the film, adored Mirren (he calls her Dame Heaven Mirren) and the director Bill Condon. He\u2019s quite proud because it\u2019s a big film, \u201cmy first proper one\u201d. I think of him as thoroughly established, but he still feels he\u2019s known more for his TV and theatre work than the \u201cculty\u201d films he\u2019s been in, such as <em>The History Boys </em>and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/11/the-pass-review-fails-escape-stage-origins-russell-tovey-john-donnelly\" title=\"\">The Pass.</a></em> This seems, to him, to be a move into a bigger film world.</p> <p>He works hard, and he moves easily between all his worlds: podcast host, theatre/TV/film actor, presenter, art collector and curator. He\u2019s even written a TV comedy drama. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to diversify now, you don\u2019t have to stay in your lane. Like [singer] Jessie Ware, her podcast [<em>Table Manners</em>] <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/may/19/jessie-lennie-ware-table-manners-podcast-interview\" title=\"\">has completely changed her life</a>.\u201d In all areas, he\u2019s acquired devoted fans, some sweet (he tells me that he cried this morning over some fan art of his character in <em>Years and Years</em>, Daniel, and his boyfriend Victor), some rude (he gets sent dick pics via social media).</p> <p>And what of the future? Long term, he has two art-style ambitions. He wants to get to a financial point where he can buy a little flat and support an emerging artist to come to London for three months and live rent-free. And he wants to have a foundation, a Tovey Foundation, which shows his collection in rotation. This would be in Margate or London, \u201canywhere, really. It could be in Essex, maybe Billericay, make it a destination.\u201d \u201cThis art,\u201d he says, \u201cI own it but it isn\u2019t mine. I feel like it\u2019s everybody\u2019s. I love sharing it. I do walks and talks around my flat like it\u2019s a museum, and I love showing off to my friends\u2026 but that\u2019s not enough. It\u2019s for everyone, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/26/art-revive-britain-towns-hull-margate-creative-high-streets-nicholas-serota\">Why the arts can lead the revival of Britain\u2019s towns | Nicholas Serota</a> </p> </aside>  <p>More short term, in previous interviews, he\u2019s talked about wanting to have a baby before he\u2019s 40. Next year, he\u2019s going to be in New York for the whole year, rehearsing and performing in Joe Mantello\u2019s production of <em>Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</em>, alongside Eddie Izzard, and he plans to use that time to set some baby wheels in motion. \u201cI\u2019ll really be putting the feelers out on how we\u2019re going to make this work,\u201d he says. I\u2019m so sure that he will make it happen that I offer congratulations. \u201cThanks,\u201d he laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s not happened yet!\u201d</p> <p>Where does his confidence come from? His parents, he says, always told him he could do anything, and he\u2019s worked hard to take advantage of his opportunities. He\u2019s had therapy when he has felt he needed to and he has followed his passions. He tells his young relatives to work out what they want to do, and pursue that with energy. He told his nephew the other day that if he wanted to go to art school, he would pay for it, \u201cand I shook his hand\u201d.</p> <p>I feel like cheering. What a positive force Russell Tovey is.</p> <p>\u201cThe thing is though, I\u2019m getting the opportunity,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like when people say to me: \u2018God, you work hard.\u2019 If you\u2019re getting the opportunity to do or have something you love, then you\u2019re going to work hard, aren\u2019t you, because work is more fun than fun. Because there\u2019s people who don\u2019t know what they want to do, or they build walls to stop themselves doing what they want to do. And that\u2019s awful.

      "bodyText": "Cor, Russell Tovey\u2019s apartment is gorgeous! A New York-style warehouse-style place, with wooden floors, big windows at front and back, two light-filled bedrooms and enough space in the living-dining-hanging-out area for an army of cool cats to swing. But it\u2019s not the flat itself that dazzles, fabulous though it is. It\u2019s the art. As soon as you walk in, you notice it. On every wall there are canvases \u2013 huge, brightly coloured abstracts, delicate etchings, cartoon-like figures in spray paint and oils. Sculptures nestle in alcoves or stand proud on tables. One piece \u2013 a chair in the guest bedroom by Jessi Reaves \u2013 is only recognisable as art because it\u2019s so tatty when compared to the rest of the furnishings. (\u201cMost of my friends hate that one,\u201d Tovey laughs. \u201cThey think it looks like it was found in a skip.\u201d) How much art does he own? He counts up in his head: \u201cAbout 250 pieces,\u201d he says. A lot of it is in storage. Well known as an actor \u2013 one of the original History Boys, Being Human and most recently, the amazing Years and Years \u2013 Tovey has another, less-documented life. He is an absolute, stone-cold art buff: a self-taught specialist, a taste-making collector, an art \u201cgeek\u201d. Geek is the word he usually uses about himself when on Talk Art, the podcast he hosts with gallery director Robert Diament; though he could equally call himself an enthusiast. He adores contemporary art, and his passion, over the years, has led him to expertise. He hosts special in-house tours in his apartment for high-up people such as patrons of the Royal Academy and is a guest curator for Margate NOW, an art festival created to celebrate this year\u2019s Turner prize being held in the town. From 28 September until 13 October Margate is being taken over by art: as well as the Turner prize, there will be performances and screenings, pieces placed in unexpected places, work that only lasts a few days, and other works that have been months in the making. Five hundred artists and performers making more than 60 events in total, most involving Margate citizens. Yuri Suzuki, a local artist, has created 12 horns representing 12 sections of Kent that will broadcast songs and tales sung and told by locals. Open School East has been busy working with Margate kids, as has 1927, a theatre company. Tovey \u2013 who recently bought a flat in Margate \u2013 is excited. \u201cCulture automatically raises the status of a place and raises its quality,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd culture is something that brings people together. That\u2019s the whole point, because it\u2019s about humans communicating with other humans about what it is to be alive.\u201d I am interested in all this of course but I am far more intrigued by Tovey\u2019s flat. Can we look around? Tovey gives me an info-packed tour. It\u2019s noticeable that he mostly chooses to highlight the female artists in his collection. The first piece he ever bought, with his cheque from the film version of The History Boys, was a Tracey Emin etching, and he has always made a point of buying women\u2019s art: Phyllida Barlow, Rebecca Warren, Rose Wylie, who he worships. He has a lot by older artists, including the 90-year-old Venezuelan Magdalena Suarez Frimkess, who works in Venice, California; Carmen Herrera, who is 104; Etel Adnan, from Beirut, in her 90s. He likes supporting female artists because he feels they have a tougher time than their male counterparts. We spend some time admiring a gorgeous work by African American artist Toyin Ojih Odutola, who, says Tovey, \u201ccreates this fantasy of these fantastical Nigerian families in images that you would normally see in white depictions of royal families. And these families have been joined by their gay sons. So it\u2019s really imagining something that probably is never possible in Nigeria, but every one of these characters has their own story and their own place within these families.\u201d He has a couple of Joyce Pensatos on display. A few months ago, he and Diament interviewed Pensato, maker of scary-drip versions of classic cartoon figures and comic book heroes. She died of pancreatic cancer in June, aged 77. Tovey had collected her art for a while, and they\u2019d become friends: she requested that her last interview be for Tovey\u2019s podcast. In just over a year, they\u2019ve made 30-plus Talk Art programmes including lively interviews with artists \u2013 Ryan Gander and Rose Wylie \u2013 or art-friendly people (often actors) such as Zawe Ashton and Lena Dunham, and art world heavyweights \u2013 the Serpentine\u2019s Hans Ulrich Obrist, gallery owner Sadie Coles and the director of Turner Contemporary, Victoria Pomery. The podcasts are gossipy and fun, engaging and well researched. The point, says Tovey, is to make a podcast about serious art that is approachable, that anyone can listen to. Tour done, we settle down for a chat at Tovey\u2019s big kitchen table. As we talk, I am struck by how different he is to most actors I\u2019ve met. Not only because of his passion for art, but because of his steady self-confidence. Most actors are insecure (understandable, given their profession), and deliberately sparkle for interviewers. Tovey is charming, friendly company, but he\u2019s also robust. Not desperate to make me like him (though I do). The main feeling I get from him is determination. I tell him he seems like the kind of person that has an idea and then absolutely commits to following it through. \u201cI am,\u201d he says. \u201cMy mum says that I\u2019m blinkered, and if I want something I get it. I think it comes from enthusiasm and I\u2019ve never apologised for being enthusiastic. When I want to know about something \u2013 ie art \u2013 I want to know everything. I have to know everything about it.\u201d When he was a kid, growing up in Billericay and Romford, Essex, Tovey used to collect stuff. Rocks, minerals, fossils, coins, stamps, phone cards. One day he realised he had to streamline his life, so he got rid: sold his coins to one of the coin shops opposite the British Museum, put the phone cards on eBay. He was good at art himself \u2013 he still draws, mostly cute cartoons of himself for his boyfriend, Steve Brockman, or of their three dogs \u2013 and he was \u201cvisually stimulated\u201d as a child, buying comics featuring Ren and Stimpy, Beavis and Butthead, Rocko\u2019s Modern Life, and watching Rugrats. It wasn\u2019t such a big leap from those to Roy Lichtenstein, Keith Haring, Andy Warhol, Mel Ramos, Patrick Caulfield. But the big \u201caha\u201d moment was when he went to see the YBA Sensation show, in 1997, when he\u2019d just turned 16 (he\u2019s nearly 38 now). \u201cIt blew my mind,\u201d he says. \u201cIt felt like something had shifted. People say, ooh, the swinging 60s, and I\u2019m always like: \u2018OK, cool\u2019\u2026 Sensation was my Woodstock moment.\u201d He went back home in a daze, and, when required by his sixth form college, Barking College, to make a speech as part of an assignment, he did one about the importance of contemporary art. He got a pig\u2019s ear from a pet shop and put it in a tank of water to explain Damien Hirst (he called it Sow Memory). He found a bit of glass and passed it round his class, asking everyone what it made them think of. \u201cThat was my Duchamp, my ready-made.\u201d He got a distinction. \u201cBut that was the only award I got. They chucked me out after a year.\u201d They chucked him out because he didn\u2019t take up a role in the college play; having been working as an actor since he was 11, he\u2019d landed some paid work and did that instead. Soon after, he started at the National Theatre, and got a life-changing part in Alan Bennett\u2019s The History Boys. He made friends with Emin when the play was up for a South Bank award. At the party afterwards, they got on so well that she subsequently asked him to be her plus one at various dos. \u201cIt was during her miaowing phase,\u201d he recalls. Now Emin has moved into her imperial era, they remain excellent friends. In fact, she gave him a discount on that first ever art purchase; he got together the money but was then shocked that he had to find 17.5% more (the VAT rate back then). Now, he\u2019s savvy enough to buy much of his art in the US, so he only pays 5% import tax, as opposed to 20% VAT. He started buying work over there when he was cast in a big HBO series, Looking, in 2013, and in later US-based series such as Quantico. How does he find the art he likes? Initially, he says, he used art advisers; but not for long. Advisers are usually there to find the work that will make the buyer the most money, and that\u2019s not why Tovey is buying art. He wants to support emerging artists, to look after work he considers important. He has ideals. \u201cContemporary art, especially, is all about the moment. The artist is trying to tell their story. So I feel like if you buy art, you\u2019re part of the dialogue about history, and you\u2019re contributing a little bit, by looking after it, to all these stories that are going to live for ever. Art is for everyone and outlives you.\u201d So now he finds the art himself. If he sees something he likes in a gallery, he will email: \u201cI always say, I\u2019m a London-based actor and collector, because some artists like being collected by an actor.\u201d He occasionally buys in auctions: \u201cI love it. But if you don\u2019t win, you do feel like you\u2019re being told off by the gavel.\u201d And he uses social media. \u201cThe magic of Instagram,\u201d he says. \u201cWith emerging artists, if you post a picture of their work or you comment on it, if you \u2018at\u2019 them, they normally contact you. Or you can direct message them and be like: \u2018Hey!\u2019 I\u2019ve done this so many times where I\u2019ve been in the States. I say: \u2018Where are you?\u2019 And they\u2019re like: \u2018In Brooklyn\u2019, and I say: \u2018Can I come do a studio visit?\u2019\u201d He understands and cultivates his own taste: \u201cI oscillate between figurative, cartoony abstraction and geometric abstractions.\u201d (Is there anything he doesn\u2019t like? He thinks: \u201cGerhard Richter\u2019s squidgy paintings. I just fucking hate them. They make me really angry. I think they\u2019re shit.\u201d) These days, friends ask him to be their art advisers. James Corden, another of the first History Boys, has been in touch, asking for advice: \u201cJames messaged me the other day, and I\u2019ve got him buying work. He\u2019s got loads of money now, so he\u2019s like: \u2018What should I do?\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Buy art!\u2019 So he\u2019s running stuff by me and I\u2019m like: \u2018No, don\u2019t do that, how about this?\u2019\u201d When he\u2019s not working, Tovey\u2019s researching art, disappearing into internet wormholes. It\u2019s how he relaxes. He re-educates himself constantly. He used to have a problem with video and sound-based work, partly because he looked at art as a collector. But now he\u2019s into it. \u201cMy medium of choice has always been painting, works on paper and sculpture. I saw video and sound art as not so important. But now I\u2019m like, \u201cNo.\u201d Because it\u2019s all about connecting and experience. And being immersive. And what\u2019s more immersive than that?\u201d Can he understand that some people find art difficult? \u201cYes,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you just have not to be intimidated by it. Go to a museum, you\u2019re going to see a thousand works of art. And if you find one you like and spend time in front of it, on some low level, molecularly, it will change you. That moment of culture.\u201d He gets cross about bad art, as he does about all bad culture. He has a little rant about rubbish plays: \u201cImagine someone going to see a play for the first time, and they\u2019ve saved up their money, and they get dressed up, and they get a train to London. And they have lunch before, all excited\u2026 and it\u2019s crap. And afterwards, they don\u2019t want to badmouth the play, they just assume that because they saw it on stage, it\u2019s got to be good. But fundamentally, inside them, they know it\u2019s not. That makes me sad.\u201d This leads us, naturally, to his acting career. Tovey has a film to promote. The Good Liar, out on 8 November, stars Ian McKellen and Helen Mirren and is \u201ca con-rom romcom\u201d. Tovey plays Mirren\u2019s son and he loved doing the film, adored Mirren (he calls her Dame Heaven Mirren) and the director Bill Condon. He\u2019s quite proud because it\u2019s a big film, \u201cmy first proper one\u201d. I think of him as thoroughly established, but he still feels he\u2019s known more for his TV and theatre work than the \u201cculty\u201d films he\u2019s been in, such as The History Boys and The Pass. This seems, to him, to be a move into a bigger film world. He works hard, and he moves easily between all his worlds: podcast host, theatre/TV/film actor, presenter, art collector and curator. He\u2019s even written a TV comedy drama. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to diversify now, you don\u2019t have to stay in your lane. Like [singer] Jessie Ware, her podcast [Table Manners] has completely changed her life.\u201d In all areas, he\u2019s acquired devoted fans, some sweet (he tells me that he cried this morning over some fan art of his character in Years and Years, Daniel, and his boyfriend Victor), some rude (he gets sent dick pics via social media). And what of the future? Long term, he has two art-style ambitions. He wants to get to a financial point where he can buy a little flat and support an emerging artist to come to London for three months and live rent-free. And he wants to have a foundation, a Tovey Foundation, which shows his collection in rotation. This would be in Margate or London, \u201canywhere, really. It could be in Essex, maybe Billericay, make it a destination.\u201d \u201cThis art,\u201d he says, \u201cI own it but it isn\u2019t mine. I feel like it\u2019s everybody\u2019s. I love sharing it. I do walks and talks around my flat like it\u2019s a museum, and I love showing off to my friends\u2026 but that\u2019s not enough. It\u2019s for everyone, isn\u2019t it?\u201d More short term, in previous interviews, he\u2019s talked about wanting to have a baby before he\u2019s 40. Next year, he\u2019s going to be in New York for the whole year, rehearsing and performing in Joe Mantello\u2019s production of Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, alongside Eddie Izzard, and he plans to use that time to set some baby wheels in motion. \u201cI\u2019ll really be putting the feelers out on how we\u2019re going to make this work,\u201d he says. I\u2019m so sure that he will make it happen that I offer congratulations. \u201cThanks,\u201d he laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s not happened yet!\u201d Where does his confidence come from? His parents, he says, always told him he could do anything, and he\u2019s worked hard to take advantage of his opportunities. He\u2019s had therapy when he has felt he needed to and he has followed his passions. He tells his young relatives to work out what they want to do, and pursue that with energy. He told his nephew the other day that if he wanted to go to art school, he would pay for it, \u201cand I shook his hand\u201d. I feel like cheering. What a positive force Russell Tovey is. \u201cThe thing is though, I\u2019m getting the opportunity,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like when people say to me: \u2018God, you work hard.\u2019 If you\u2019re getting the opportunity to do or have something you love, then you\u2019re going to work hard, aren\u2019t you, because work is more fun than fun. Because there\u2019s people who don\u2019t know what they want to do, or they build walls to stop themselves doing what they want to do. And that\u2019s awful. Isn\u2019t it the best gift to know what you want to do with your life?\u201d Margate NOW runs from 28 Sep\u201313 Oct. The Turner prize is at Turner Contemporary, Margate, 28 Sep\u201312 Jan 2020 Five of Russell Tovey\u2019s favourite artists \u25b2 Loie Hollowell Minnesota-born Hollowell\u2019s brightly coloured, almost abstract female bodies glow on the wall. Because she produces relatively few paintings, taking around three months on each, there are few for sale and they are in huge demand. \u25b2 Joyce Pensato Pensato, who died earlier this year aged 77, came to success late, beginning her wild, funny, scary punk cartoons in the 90s. \u201cI like being messy and I love throwing paint around and fucking it all up,\u201d she once said. \u25b2 Magdalena Suarez Frimkess Born in Venezuela, 90-year-old Suarez has worked with sculptor Michael Frimkess, her husband, in California since 1963. He throws pots and she glazes them with an intricate mix of cartoons, slogans, snapshots, flowers and more. \u25b2 Jamian Juliano-Villani Juliano-Villani, from New Jersey, describes her hyper-real, dreamlike paintings as \u201ccar accidents\u201d: there\u2019s something uncomfortable about them, but you can\u2019t stop looking. \u25b2 Toyin Ojih Odutola Nigerian-born, US-based Ojih Odutola imagines a world where black people hold the power. Her virtuoso technique and bright palette make for beautiful drawings. MS",

      "bodyText": "Born in north London in 1959, Orlando Figes has published a number of works on Europe and Russian history. Between 1984 and 1999, he taught at Trinity College, Cambridge; he is now professor of history at Birkbeck College, University of London. His books include A People\u2019s Tragedy (1996), Natasha\u2019s Dance (2002) and The Whisperers (2007). His latest, The Europeans: Three Lives and the Making of a Cosmopolitan Culture, is published by Allen Lane. 1. Theatre Death of a Salesman, Piccadilly theatre, London W1 The Young Vic production of Arthur Miller\u2019s masterpiece transfers to the West End this autumn. Don\u2019t miss it. The cast is outstanding, particularly Wendell Pierce as Willy and Sharon D Clarke as Linda. The all-black casting of the Loman family adds a fresh perspective to the play, whose universal themes are all the more powerful for it. I went with my daughter, Lydia, and we left in floods of tears, retiring to the nearest pub to talk about the different emotions the play had evoked in each of us. She compared the experience to a lifetime of \u201cfamily therapy\u201d. 2. Architecture The Barbican, London EC2 As a Barbican resident, I have come to love the brutalist estate (and, after five years of living there, can just about find my way round it). I love its tranquillity, the birdsong in the garden, the conservatory, the running water, the rough concrete, the open spaces and sightlines \u2013 a masterpiece of modernist design. It is an outrage that part of the estate, a Grade II*-listed conservation area, is now threatened by development: the City of London School for Girls, a private enterprise, wants to build a canteen underneath the beautiful double pilasters of Mountjoy House, one of the iconic architectural features of the original design by Chamberlin, Powell and Bon. 3. Exhibition Leonardo da Vinci: A Life in Drawing, The Queen\u2019s Gallery, London What a bonanza we have had this year, the 500th anniversary of Leonardo\u2019s death. And full marks to the Royal Collection Trust for touring the UK with its treasure of Leonardo drawings, culminating in this glorious exhibition, part of which will go to Holyrood in November. Because so much of Leonardo\u2019s work was unfinished, his drawings give a fascinating insight into the creative processes and imagination of this genius, who was not just an artist but an engineer, architect, anatomist and philosopher. 4. Place Bougival, Paris The Parisian suburb on the Seine was the birthplace of the impressionist movement, according to Kenneth Clark. It was also the last home of the Russian writer Ivan Turgenev, who lived there with the great love of his life, the singer and composer Pauline Viardot and her husband, Louis Viardot, a great art expert. I have lived with these three figures in my head for the past seven years \u2013 they are at the centre of my new book \u2013 but to visit the abandoned Viardot villa and the adjoining dacha built by Turgenev is to have a visceral sense of their spiritual presence and relationship. 5. Opera Orpheus season at the ENO I am looking forward to this. Gluck\u2019s Orpheus and Eurydice is infrequently performed but its music is sublime and it was a founding work of the operatic canon in the 19th century. In 1859, Berlioz adapted it for Pauline Viardot in the title role, which she really created. The ENO is also putting on a new production of Orpheus in the Underworld, Offenbach\u2019s hilarious send-up of the classical love story, which prompted Berlioz to revive the work of his musical hero. 6. Book Ora dimmi di te (Now Tell Me About You) by Andrea Camilleri As a Montalbano fan, I was saddened by the death this year of Andrea Camilleri, the author of the popular detective books, which spawned the TV series. A year before his death, at the age of 93, Camilleri published this enchanting literary gem, the story of his life \u2013 and a little history of Italy since fascism \u2013 told in letters to his great-granddaughter Matilda.

One of the most important arrests following the magistrates\u2019 deaths was that of Tot\u00f2 \u201cthe beast\u201d Riina, one of the most ruthless bosses in the history of Cosa Nostra.</p> <p>Riina, who ordered the magistrates\u2019 killings and another 150 murders, was arrested in 1993 and sentenced to life in prison. In November 2017, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/17/toto-riina-sicilian-mafia-boss-of-bosses-dies-cosa-nostra-italy\" title=\"\">died in jail</a> while in a medically-induced coma following cancer treatment.</p> <p>\u201cRiina formally remained the boss of the Sicilian mafia until the day he died,\u201d says Sergio Lari, former anti-mafia prosecutor who for more than 10 years was head of the Palermo anti-mafia directorate and lead investigator in the Falcone and Borsellino killings. \u201cIt\u2019s clear, however, that in recent years it was difficult for him to manage the organisation\u2019s business interests, given his poor health and the fact that he was isolated in prison.\u201d</p> <p>The truth is that no one had enough authority to take his place. Today, the most respected bosses are all in jail or have died there. They have been replaced by younger criminals who don\u2019t seem to have the same authority as their predecessors. Rosalba Di Gregorio, one of Palermo\u2019s leading lawyers, defended the superboss and right-hand man of Riina, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/13/italian-mafia-boss-bernardo-tractor-provenzano-dies\" title=\"\">Bernardo \u201cthe tractor\u201d Provenzano</a>. She describes the mafia as in disarray, with \u201cnew bosses who are not really bosses at all. They are men who, once they\u2019ve served their prison time and are back on the streets, put on airs as godfathers. They think they\u2019re bosses. The truth is that this is no longer Cosa Nostra.\u201d</p> <p>Giovanni Falcone\u2019s sister, Maria, says: \u201cIn comparison to yesterday\u2019s bosses, who waged war against the Italian state, the new generation are chicken thieves.\u201d</p> <p>Some believe that the only true godfather capable of taking the reins of the Sicilian mafia is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/03/police-arrest-sicilian-mafia-message-code-italian-denaro\" title=\"\">Matteo Messina Denaro</a>, one of the world\u2019s most wanted fugitives, who has been in hiding since 1993. But experts, and many mafiosi, disagree.</p> <p>\u201cAside from being a dangerous criminal, the idea that Denaro could be the new super-godfather is just media rhetoric,\u201d says Lupo, co-author of the book <em>La mafia non ha vinto</em> (The Mafia Hasn\u2019t Won) with Giovanni Fiandaca. \u201cWe are persuaded to believe that his capture represents that ultimate defeat of Cosa Nostra, but Messina Denaro doesn\u2019t even enjoy legitimacy among many Sicilian bosses.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMessina Denaro is the last Mohican of the old mafia,\u201d says Lari. \u201cHe may be the boss of the entire province of Trapani, but he certainly isn\u2019t the boss of bosses of Cosa Nostra. Internal dynamics aside, he could never be the superboss for one reason: Matteo Denaro is not from Palermo, and that role is normally held by men from Palermo.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"290ee837a277f17dbde6ba5ee373d2390d2562d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/290ee837a277f17dbde6ba5ee373d2390d2562d9/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maria Falcone\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maria Falcone, sister of the judge Giovanni Falcone, during a commemoration of the 25th anniversary of the murder of her brother.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alessio Mamo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Technological advances in the fight against the mafia have played a crucial role. First and foremost is the use of wiretaps and hidden cameras. Bugs placed in bosses\u2019 homes and hidden cameras in mafia hangouts have shed light on the new mobsters\u2019 activities. They have led to compelling evidence in court, with bosses often receiving long sentences in maximum-security prisons.</p> <p>Following the deaths of Falcone and Borsellino, the notoriously harsh prison regime, first introduced in 1975, was intensified, aiming at cutting off mafia inmates completely from their former criminal associates. The new regime banned the use of telephones, any association or correspondence with other prisoners, or meetings with third parties. In order to avoid living a completely isolated life, many mafiosi decide to turn state\u2019s witness.</p> <p>In Italy they are called <em>pentiti</em>, literally \u201crepentant\u201d. They are mafiosi who, in exchange for lighter sentences, have testified in court against their former associates, thereby contributing to additional arrests and the further weakening of Cosa Nostra. Today, more than 300 former mobsters are collaborating with authorities in Sicily.</p> <p>The economic crisis, which has hit Italy hard, has also affected the mafia. One of the mafia\u2019s most profitable earners has traditionally been the construction sector, in which companies with ties to mafia bosses would earn millions by skimming contracts for bridges, roads and buildings. In the mafia\u2019s golden years of the 1970s, in Palermo alone mafia-controlled construction activity was worth more than \u00a31bn.</p> <p>Today the building sector in Sicily is at one of its lowest points: 73,216 people were made redundant between 2008 and 2017, and more than 5,000 businesses have closed, according to Italy\u2019s largest trade union federation. Many mafia families have been forced to decrease the amount of protection money asked of business owners. Investigations in Palermo have even brought to light the technique of paying on an instalment plan, a strategy that, nonetheless, has resulted in arrests following reports from rebellious shopkeepers who are now less fearful of a weakened mafia and more confident that the law will be successfully enforced.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c3832cf1723a52c23e6cf2e48afed7b043d14469\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3832cf1723a52c23e6cf2e48afed7b043d14469/0_235_6720_4245/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A stall selling Godfather themed t-shirts in Palermo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"632\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A stall selling Godfather themed t-shirts in Palermo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In wiretaps, bosses have complained of the economic crisis and have admitted the organisation\u2019s increased weakness.</p> <p>\u201cWhat kind of bloody mafia are we?\u201d asked Alfredo Giordano, a former mafioso from Palermo caught on wiretap. \u201cThe mafia of lost causes.\u201d He wasn\u2019t even able to recover objects that were stolen from his daughter.</p> <p>The mafiosi who speak today used to drive Mercedes down the streets of Palermo in the 1980s. Men who held in their hands the life or death of police officers and journalists have lost their power to intimidate.</p> <p>The wife of mafia boss Salvatore Spica, in a wiretap, complained to her husband: \u201cI used \u20ac100 for my mother\u2019s groceries, \u20ac200 for the dentist. What\u2019s left? All I have left is spare change.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf we had to draw a graph of the military and economic power of Cosa Nostra in the last 100 years,\u201d says Lari, \u201cthe highest point on the curve would be the mid-1980s. From the 1990s on, with peaks and troughs, the general trend would be a decrease, up to today, where we\u2019d find the lowest levels.\u201d</p> <p>Lari believes that one of the most telling examples of the mafia\u2019s current state of crisis is the drugs trade, \u201cwhere we\u2019ve seen an absolute monopoly on the part of Cosa Nostra transform into bilateral and subordinate agreements, often with the powerful Calabrian \u2019Ndrangheta\u201d.</p> <p>In the 1970s, the mafia not only trafficked drugs, it also produced them. Morphine was often purchased in Switzerland and transported to Palermo, where it was processed in hundreds of refineries hidden in the countryside. At the time, 30% of the heroin in the US was produced in Sicily.</p> <p>Today, the tonnes of cocaine on the streets of Palermo and Catania, as recent investigations have revealed, are moved by the Calabrian \u2019Ndrangheta. Once snubbed by the Sicilian bosses, today their Calabrian counterparts forge ties with Colombian narcos, control ports, and sell their goods to the Sicilians, who have been demoted to the status of \u201ccustomers\u201d.</p> <p>Between 1978 and 1983, the Sicilian mafia killed more than 1,000 people. Hundreds died in the early 80s. Since the mid-1990s, the number of homicides has decreased significantly. The last five years in Palermo have seen only one homicide attributable to Cosa Nostra.</p> <p>It was 22 May 2017 when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/22/italian-mafia-killed-sicily-cosa-nostra\" title=\"\">two hitmen killed</a> the boss Giuseppe Dainotti, who every morning around 7.50am would ride his bike to the grocery. He took one bullet to the head and a second to the body. The residents in the Noce quarter of Palermo couldn\u2019t make sense of what had happened, as Dainotti\u2019s body lay in a pool of blood for 10 minutes. People had become so unaccustomed to hearing gunshots that they mistook the sounds for fireworks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bbe2b20fca0e38b4c6f4daf4e4e0b7c0b7e9ccf5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bbe2b20fca0e38b4c6f4daf4e4e0b7c0b7e9ccf5/0_314_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mural of Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Students of the Istituto Nautico Gioeni \u2013 Trabia in front at the mural of judges Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, killed by the mafia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alessio Mamo/Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two obelisks were erected as a memorial on either side of the motorway where Falcone\u2019s car was blown up in 1992.

The city\u2019s scars have become monuments and an indelible reminder that in the war between good and evil, good has gained the upper hand.</p> <p>\u201cThe battle isn\u2019t over,\u201d says Maria Falcone. \u201cMy brother Giovanni said that the mafia is a human phenomenon, and like all human phenomena, it had a beginning and it will have an end. Well, despite the current crisis of Cosa Nostra, that end has not yet arrived.\u201d</p> <p>Maybe the end hasn\u2019t come yet.

First and foremost is the use of wiretaps and hidden cameras. Bugs placed in bosses\u2019 homes and hidden cameras in mafia hangouts have shed light on the new mobsters\u2019 activities. They have led to compelling evidence in court, with bosses often receiving long sentences in maximum-security prisons. Following the deaths of Falcone and Borsellino, the notoriously harsh prison regime, first introduced in 1975, was intensified, aiming at cutting off mafia inmates completely from their former criminal associates. The new regime banned the use of telephones, any association or correspondence with other prisoners, or meetings with third parties. In order to avoid living a completely isolated life, many mafiosi decide to turn state\u2019s witness. In Italy they are called pentiti, literally \u201crepentant\u201d. They are mafiosi who, in exchange for lighter sentences, have testified in court against their former associates, thereby contributing to additional arrests and the further weakening of Cosa Nostra. Today, more than 300 former mobsters are collaborating with authorities in Sicily. The economic crisis, which has hit Italy hard, has also affected the mafia. One of the mafia\u2019s most profitable earners has traditionally been the construction sector, in which companies with ties to mafia bosses would earn millions by skimming contracts for bridges, roads and buildings. In the mafia\u2019s golden years of the 1970s, in Palermo alone mafia-controlled construction activity was worth more than \u00a31bn. Today the building sector in Sicily is at one of its lowest points: 73,216 people were made redundant between 2008 and 2017, and more than 5,000 businesses have closed, according to Italy\u2019s largest trade union federation. Many mafia families have been forced to decrease the amount of protection money asked of business owners. Investigations in Palermo have even brought to light the technique of paying on an instalment plan, a strategy that, nonetheless, has resulted in arrests following reports from rebellious shopkeepers who are now less fearful of a weakened mafia and more confident that the law will be successfully enforced. In wiretaps, bosses have complained of the economic crisis and have admitted the organisation\u2019s increased weakness. \u201cWhat kind of bloody mafia are we?\u201d asked Alfredo Giordano, a former mafioso from Palermo caught on wiretap. \u201cThe mafia of lost causes.\u201d He wasn\u2019t even able to recover objects that were stolen from his daughter. The mafiosi who speak today used to drive Mercedes down the streets of Palermo in the 1980s. Men who held in their hands the life or death of police officers and journalists have lost their power to intimidate. The wife of mafia boss Salvatore Spica, in a wiretap, complained to her husband: \u201cI used \u20ac100 for my mother\u2019s groceries, \u20ac200 for the dentist. What\u2019s left? All I have left is spare change.\u201d \u201cIf we had to draw a graph of the military and economic power of Cosa Nostra in the last 100 years,\u201d says Lari, \u201cthe highest point on the curve would be the mid-1980s. From the 1990s on, with peaks and troughs, the general trend would be a decrease, up to today, where we\u2019d find the lowest levels.\u201d Lari believes that one of the most telling examples of the mafia\u2019s current state of crisis is the drugs trade, \u201cwhere we\u2019ve seen an absolute monopoly on the part of Cosa Nostra transform into bilateral and subordinate agreements, often with the powerful Calabrian \u2019Ndrangheta\u201d. In the 1970s, the mafia not only trafficked drugs, it also produced them. Morphine was often purchased in Switzerland and transported to Palermo, where it was processed in hundreds of refineries hidden in the countryside. At the time, 30% of the heroin in the US was produced in Sicily. Today, the tonnes of cocaine on the streets of Palermo and Catania, as recent investigations have revealed, are moved by the Calabrian \u2019Ndrangheta. Once snubbed by the Sicilian bosses, today their Calabrian counterparts forge ties with Colombian narcos, control ports, and sell their goods to the Sicilians, who have been demoted to the status of \u201ccustomers\u201d. Between 1978 and 1983, the Sicilian mafia killed more than 1,000 people. Hundreds died in the early 80s. Since the mid-1990s, the number of homicides has decreased significantly. The last five years in Palermo have seen only one homicide attributable to Cosa Nostra. It was 22 May 2017 when two hitmen killed the boss Giuseppe Dainotti, who every morning around 7.50am would ride his bike to the grocery. He took one bullet to the head and a second to the body. The residents in the Noce quarter of Palermo couldn\u2019t make sense of what had happened, as Dainotti\u2019s body lay in a pool of blood for 10 minutes. People had become so unaccustomed to hearing gunshots that they mistook the sounds for fireworks. Two obelisks were erected as a memorial on either side of the motorway where Falcone\u2019s car was blown up in 1992. Hundreds of visitors stop, in both directions, to leave flowers and pray. They do the same in front of the memorial placard on Via D\u2019Amelio where Borsellino was murdered. Gigantic masterpieces of street art on the buildings of Palermo, depicting mafia victims, have taken the place of pro-mafia slogans. The city\u2019s scars have become monuments and an indelible reminder that in the war between good and evil, good has gained the upper hand. \u201cThe battle isn\u2019t over,\u201d says Maria Falcone. \u201cMy brother Giovanni said that the mafia is a human phenomenon, and like all human phenomena, it had a beginning and it will have an end. Well, despite the current crisis of Cosa Nostra, that end has not yet arrived.\u201d Maybe the end hasn\u2019t come yet. But at least the mafia bosses who used to drive fancy cars, buy lavish villas and feel arrogant enough to take on the Italian state, like the boss Dainotti, now move and die on a bicycle.",

They fade into the pre-school fog when real friends, by which I mean children, by which I mean small people who cry about breakfast and teach each other how to draw hands, take priority. But it is being reported as a tragedy that imaginary friends are dissolving altogether. In 2004, it was estimated that by the age of seven, 65% of children had an imaginary friend. Last month a study of nursery workers revealed that 72% believed children have fewer imaginary friends than they did five years ago, blaming, guess, correct, screens.

It reverberates well beyond China \u2013 and that setting alone, rare for a British theatre, is a promising aspect of the programming by Hampstead\u2019s new artistic director, Roxana Silbert. <br>In Henan province in the early 1990s, Chinese farmers, compelled to work in mines to support themselves, are desperate to find a way out of poverty. They consider growing peonies, symbols of good fortune; they are offered a quick route to wealth by selling blood plasma. The pressure to make a profit leads to blood getting mixed: infection follows; a doctor alerts the authorities but is ignored; later, violent attempts are made to silence her. By the end of the play, the skin of the farmers is marked by lesions \u2013 while the doctor notes that \u201cofficially there\u2019s no Aids in the country\u201d.\u2019</p> <p>Tom Piper\u2019s design brings the story into immediate life: a shrine of family pictures; baskets spilling over with richly coloured peonies; rails cutting brutally through the landscape. There are memorable images: corpse flowers \u201cbloom once a year and smell like rotting flesh\u201d. The idea of contaminated blood is a powerful warning of what follows when healthcare is dictated by commercial interests \u2013 and a powerful metaphor of a poisoned political system. But the dialogue does not match the visual immediacy, and Michael Boyd\u2019s production \u2013 with an unusual number of fluffs on press night \u2013 does not rescue it from galumphing. The first half is soggy with exposition; it is only halfway through that a thriller element \u2013 kidnap, hoods \u2013 enables the play to move from explanation to action. An important story has not yet been fully dramatised.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2kU76FQm9s\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/T2kU76FQm9s?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2kU76FQm9s\">Watch a trailer for Chiaroscuro at the Bush.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>At the Bush, Lynette Linton begins her reign as artistic director with another play evidently in the grip of a crusading purpose. There are lovely possibilities in Jackie Kay\u2019s 1986 poetic drama <strong><a href=\"https://www.bushtheatre.co.uk/event/chiaroscuro/\" title=\"\">Chiaroscuro</a></strong>, but too much spelling out. In a recording studio, members of a girl band discover and deny same-sex love. They begin by explaining the origin of their names: a Himalayan grandmother, a Nigerian mother, a \u201cstrong woman\u201d (I think we should rest this term, which makes it sound like this is a rare beast) who was the daughter of slaves. Most strikingly, a girl in care, born of one black and one white parent, is called Opal because she changes with the light. As two of them fall in love, and one proves to be a homophobe, they go on explaining, sometimes over-lyrically, sometimes ruminatively in song. The aim is admirable, the execution accomplished; the subtext and tightness are missing.</p> <p><em>Star ratings (out of five)</em><br>F<em>aith, Hope &amp; Charity </em><strong>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</strong><br><em>The King of Hell\u2019s Palace</em> <strong>\u2605\u2605\u2605</strong><br>Chiaroscuro <strong>\u2605\u2605\u2605</strong></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/faith-hope-and-charity/dates-listing\" title=\"\">Faith, Hope and Charity</a> is at the Dorfman, National Theatre, London, until 12 October<br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.hampsteadtheatre.com/whats-on/2019/the-king-of-hells/\" title=\"\">The King of Hell\u2019s Palace </a>is at the Hampstead theatre, London, until 12 October<br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.bushtheatre.co.uk/event/chiaroscuro/\" title=\"\">Chiaroscuro</a> is at the Bush theatre, London, until 5 October</p>",

The pressure to make a profit leads to blood getting mixed: infection follows; a doctor alerts the authorities but is ignored; later, violent attempts are made to silence her. By the end of the play, the skin of the farmers is marked by lesions \u2013 while the doctor notes that \u201cofficially there\u2019s no Aids in the country\u201d.\u2019 Tom Piper\u2019s design brings the story into immediate life: a shrine of family pictures; baskets spilling over with richly coloured peonies; rails cutting brutally through the landscape. There are memorable images: corpse flowers \u201cbloom once a year and smell like rotting flesh\u201d. The idea of contaminated blood is a powerful warning of what follows when healthcare is dictated by commercial interests \u2013 and a powerful metaphor of a poisoned political system. But the dialogue does not match the visual immediacy, and Michael Boyd\u2019s production \u2013 with an unusual number of fluffs on press night \u2013 does not rescue it from galumphing. The first half is soggy with exposition; it is only halfway through that a thriller element \u2013 kidnap, hoods \u2013 enables the play to move from explanation to action. An important story has not yet been fully dramatised. At the Bush, Lynette Linton begins her reign as artistic director with another play evidently in the grip of a crusading purpose. There are lovely possibilities in Jackie Kay\u2019s 1986 poetic drama Chiaroscuro, but too much spelling out. In a recording studio, members of a girl band discover and deny same-sex love. They begin by explaining the origin of their names: a Himalayan grandmother, a Nigerian mother, a \u201cstrong woman\u201d (I think we should rest this term, which makes it sound like this is a rare beast) who was the daughter of slaves. Most strikingly, a girl in care, born of one black and one white parent, is called Opal because she changes with the light. As two of them fall in love, and one proves to be a homophobe, they go on explaining, sometimes over-lyrically, sometimes ruminatively in song. The aim is admirable, the execution accomplished; the subtext and tightness are missing.

This is a story told through her eyes.</p> <p><strong>Was it a story you were aware of?</strong><br>No. It was only a week before the war started, wasn\u2019t it?

Did you join the anti-war <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/feb/15/politics.politicalnews\" title=\"\">march</a> in London?</strong><br>I wasn\u2019t on the big march; I was on the one before that. When the big march happened, I was in America shooting <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em> and feeling utterly stupid that I was in a pirate costume and all my mates were on an anti-war march. I remember sitting in the makeup bus and there being a conversation along the lines of \u201cWe are going into Iraq to pay them back for 9/11\u201d and thinking \u201cHold on - I don\u2019t think that was Iraq!\u201d For my generation it was the first time that we had been really politically engaged - and it didn\u2019t change anything. There was disillusionment after that. Quite severe. The way that we viewed politicians and the world was massively coloured by the weeks leading up to that conflict.</p> <p><strong>And led to where we are </strong><strong>now? Katharine has that great line</strong><strong> in the film, which </strong><strong>was cheered at Sundance</strong><strong>: \u201cJust because you are prime minister that doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re allowed to make things up</strong><strong>.\u201d</strong><br>Look where we are now. The questions we have about government and accountability go back to that. Why are politicians who lie not held to account? The script made me think hard about that.</p> <p><strong>The movie is very faithful to the story \u2013 which means that it doesn\u2019t have a Hollywood ending\u2026</strong><br>It\u2019s a very British story in that way. It has that heroic failure about it. But what are you going to do? Write an ending in which the war didn\u2019t happen? She didn\u2019t stop it.

I\u2019ve always loved a political thriller. I know some people like escapism, and that\u2019s fine, but I like to be challenged. I was watching <em>Paths of Glory</em> last night, the Kubrick film, 1957, black and white, Kirk Douglas, about the futility of war, and political lies, and it\u2019s amazing.</p> <p><strong>There is an audience for these films just now\u2026</strong><br>I hope so. People are politically re-engaged. You know, different times create different audiences. I think the National Theatre was set up when it was because it was a moment when we suddenly wanted to walk in other people\u2019s shoes. And now, at a time when nationalism is on the rise, it seems important to set these questions [of patriotism] out there. Whether they get to the \u2018right\u2019 audience or not is another question of course.</p> <p><strong>Do you have any qualms about putting your head above the parapet, as it were, and talking about political issues?</strong><br>One thing I learned from being in the public eye when I was very young is this: you can say nothing and some people will hate you, and you can say something and some people will hate you. So you might as well, if you are feeling like it, say something. If I am asked my opinion, I generally don\u2019t have a problem giving it.</p> <p><strong>You don\u2019t do any social media\u2026</strong><br>I had an account for about five seconds. I watched it accumulate, like, 100 followers in three seconds and I got so freaked out that I turned it off straight away. . And then Facebook. I was on for a day 10 years ago, and never posted anything on it, but it still emails me all the time as if I am a member or whatever.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP4zhzIyTUA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pP4zhzIyTUA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP4zhzIyTUA\">Watch a trailer for Official Secrets.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>That has obviously been a conscious decision\u2026</strong><br>It has. I mean, the thing is, I don\u2019t have very much that I want to share in that way. I have a child and another one on the way, and I want their privacy to be safe and sacred until they are old enough to choose what they want to do with their lives. I don\u2019t write about family life \u2013 though of course I did write a very long <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/feminists-don-t-wear-pink-and-other-lies.html\" title=\"\">essay</a> about my vagina splitting! I am better at that kind of thing. Also I am rubbish at taking pictures, so my Instagram feed or whatever would be an embarrassment.</p> <p><strong>Where do you go for news?</strong><br>I get my news from the <em>Guardian</em> and the <em>New York Times </em>and the <em>Financial Times </em>at the weekend. I feel I should be branching out more, because I am reading papers that I generally agree with. My husband has - really kindly! - forced me into reading all of the climate change books that he has been reading. Which is just great when you are pregnant. I am halfway through <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/27/the-uninhabitable-earth-review-david-wallace-wells\" title=\"\">Uninhabitable Earth</a></em>.

I spend half my time saying sorry to my baby in there. Maybe I should start reading all those rightwing newspapers and then I could pretend everything will be fine\u2026</p> <p><strong>The </strong><strong>film centres on the courage of Katharine Gun in telling the truth. Can you imagine doing that yourself in that situation?</strong><br>Honestly, I have no idea whether I would \u2013 and I think that is what I find fascinating about it. It\u2019s funny; we all like to think we are truth-tellers. But we also know what the consequences are for truth-tellers like Katharine. Pretty horrific. What is interesting, culturally, I think, is that America has had relatively more whistleblowers than Britain. I think that generally speaking we do what we are told, and we toe the line. I have no idea why that is. Would I do it? I don\u2019t know. I have no idea. I think it might even depend on how I was feeling that day.</p> <p><em>Official Secrets is released on 18 October</em></p>",

I remember sitting in the makeup bus and there being a conversation along the lines of \u201cWe are going into Iraq to pay them back for 9/11\u201d and thinking \u201cHold on - I don\u2019t think that was Iraq!\u201d For my generation it was the first time that we had been really politically engaged - and it didn\u2019t change anything. There was disillusionment after that. Quite severe. The way that we viewed politicians and the world was massively coloured by the weeks leading up to that conflict. And led to where we are now? Katharine has that great line in the film, which was cheered at Sundance: \u201cJust because you are prime minister that doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re allowed to make things up.\u201d Look where we are now. The questions we have about government and accountability go back to that. Why are politicians who lie not held to account? The script made me think hard about that. The movie is very faithful to the story \u2013 which means that it doesn\u2019t have a Hollywood ending\u2026 It\u2019s a very British story in that way. It has that heroic failure about it. But what are you going to do? Write an ending in which the war didn\u2019t happen? She didn\u2019t stop it. She told the truth and there was little consequence. Films are a good way of opening up those historical questions. Are you offered more parts with a political edge than you were 15 years ago? Yeah, definitely. I\u2019ve always loved a political thriller. I know some people like escapism, and that\u2019s fine, but I like to be challenged. I was watching Paths of Glory last night, the Kubrick film, 1957, black and white, Kirk Douglas, about the futility of war, and political lies, and it\u2019s amazing. There is an audience for these films just now\u2026 I hope so. People are politically re-engaged. You know, different times create different audiences. I think the National Theatre was set up when it was because it was a moment when we suddenly wanted to walk in other people\u2019s shoes. And now, at a time when nationalism is on the rise, it seems important to set these questions [of patriotism] out there. Whether they get to the \u2018right\u2019 audience or not is another question of course. Do you have any qualms about putting your head above the parapet, as it were, and talking about political issues? One thing I learned from being in the public eye when I was very young is this: you can say nothing and some people will hate you, and you can say something and some people will hate you. So you might as well, if you are feeling like it, say something. If I am asked my opinion, I generally don\u2019t have a problem giving it. You don\u2019t do any social media\u2026 I had an account for about five seconds. I watched it accumulate, like, 100 followers in three seconds and I got so freaked out that I turned it off straight away. . And then Facebook. I was on for a day 10 years ago, and never posted anything on it, but it still emails me all the time as if I am a member or whatever. That has obviously been a conscious decision\u2026 It has. I mean, the thing is, I don\u2019t have very much that I want to share in that way. I have a child and another one on the way, and I want their privacy to be safe and sacred until they are old enough to choose what they want to do with their lives. I don\u2019t write about family life \u2013 though of course I did write a very long essay about my vagina splitting! I am better at that kind of thing. Also I am rubbish at taking pictures, so my Instagram feed or whatever would be an embarrassment. Where do you go for news? I get my news from the Guardian and the New York Times and the Financial Times at the weekend. I feel I should be branching out more, because I am reading papers that I generally agree with. My husband has - really kindly! - forced me into reading all of the climate change books that he has been reading. Which is just great when you are pregnant. I am halfway through Uninhabitable Earth. I have to do the Naomi Klein next. I spend half my time saying sorry to my baby in there. Maybe I should start reading all those rightwing newspapers and then I could pretend everything will be fine\u2026 The film centres on the courage of Katharine Gun in telling the truth. Can you imagine doing that yourself in that situation? Honestly, I have no idea whether I would \u2013 and I think that is what I find fascinating about it. It\u2019s funny; we all like to think we are truth-tellers. But we also know what the consequences are for truth-tellers like Katharine. Pretty horrific. What is interesting, culturally, I think, is that America has had relatively more whistleblowers than Britain. I think that generally speaking we do what we are told, and we toe the line. I have no idea why that is. Would I do it? I don\u2019t know. I have no idea. I think it might even depend on how I was feeling that day. Official Secrets is released on 18 October",

      "body": "<p>Britain faces a crisis of political leadership. Neither the right nor the left of politics is capable of throwing up a figure who can bind their respective coalitions together and sustain parliamentary majorities best to navigate Brexit or Remain and their aftermath.</p> <p>Faith in parliamentary democracy is plummeting; belief in strongman politics is rising; the view that there is an elite, of which the political class is a member, intent only on feathering its own nest and pursuing its own sectarian interests, is widespread.</p> <p>This mood is even more dangerous than Brexit \u2013 it strikes at the legitimacy of the institutions, even the idea of democracy. The problem originated on the right but it has parallels on the left. One of the by-products of the two world wars was that they bound the classes together. The politicians, financiers, business and media leaders who rose to the top from the 1930s to the 1970s were sensitive to the toughness of the lives of ordinary men and women. They had fought alongside and had depended on them; they knew they weren\u2019t the shirkers and societal enemies depicted by the right today. Equally, men had seen their officers fight and die alongside their pals. Whatever their weaknesses and privileges, at bottom they could be trusted.</p> <p>This was crucial for the construction of the Tory one-nation tradition \u2013 in politics and business alike. Conservatives such as Harold Macmillan or Ted Heath had served in war. Instinctively, they upheld the principles of the postwar settlement, just as business leaders wanted to run honourable companies that offered pensions, recognised unions and kept their own pay in touch with that of their workers. It was what you did. The entitlements that came with leadership were matched by responsibilities. You might have political opponents and adversaries but they were never despised enemies.</p> <p>Today, that has been shattered. The private equity and hedge fund barons who fund Boris Johnson along with the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-44618154\" title=\"\">\u201cfuck business\u201d</a> prime minister himself feel only entitlement \u2013 and no serious responsibility. They are entitled to great wealth because they are capitalist \u201cbuccaneers\u201d who create wealth; society is lucky to have them and plays no part in the wealth-creation process that is down to them alone. Skills, infrastructure, science \u2013 they are nice to have but essentially second-order concerns.</p> <p>The political task is to create a Britain fit for even more buccaneering, as free from tax and regulation as possible, especially free from the EU. A NHS hospital is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2019/sep/18/boris-johnson-confronted-patient-father-nhs-waiting-times-video\" title=\"\">place for photo-opportunities </a>rather than representative of an institution in whose values you believe and curate. Personally, your instinct is to go private, just as you were educated privately.</p> <p>One of the breathtaking aspects of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/19/david-cameron-autobiography-for-the-record-review-brexit-referendum\" title=\"\">David Cameron\u2019s memoir</a> is his defence of austerity cast wholly in top-down terms. A more honourable and decent man than Johnson, he has nonetheless no conception of how the scale of the spending cuts he authored ripped through British society \u2013 or of the new precariousness of the British world of work. We could have done even more, he opines. I doubt that if he had fought on the Somme or across Normandy in 1944 \u2013 or had not been educated at Eton \u2013 he would have been so insouciant about the social impact.</p> <p>On the left, the Blair government, elected to make over Britain\u2019s economy and society, did not leave a sufficiently enduring trace. There is no network of loved institutions and systems embodying leftwing values impossible to dismantle because their function is so well understood. There is no system, say, of lifelong learning or public investment banks, nor a network of brilliant co-operatives, mutuals and employee-owned firms or a well-understood commitment to the EU.</p> <p>Instead, there was the Iraq war, covert, all-too-easy-to-reverse spending increases and an inadequate promotion of the European cause. It genuflected too much to the new responsibility-free elite, anxious to win their endorsement.</p> <p>Jeremy Corbyn, his coterie and Momentum are now the counterreaction. Yet while their commitment not to make the same mistakes is understandable and in some ways admirable, they are wildly overshooting and even more locked in their own self-defined universe beyond which everyone is an enemy.</p> <p>This provides the mirror image to Johnson and his malevolent troll, Dominic Cummings. Every business leader is perforce a member of the boss class; members of the Labour party beyond their group are collaborators and traitors. Their responsibility is to a particularly narrow socialism in whose name they seek to have unchallengeable control of the Labour party.</p> <p>For what purpose?

      "bodyText": "Britain faces a crisis of political leadership. Neither the right nor the left of politics is capable of throwing up a figure who can bind their respective coalitions together and sustain parliamentary majorities best to navigate Brexit or Remain and their aftermath. Faith in parliamentary democracy is plummeting; belief in strongman politics is rising; the view that there is an elite, of which the political class is a member, intent only on feathering its own nest and pursuing its own sectarian interests, is widespread. This mood is even more dangerous than Brexit \u2013 it strikes at the legitimacy of the institutions, even the idea of democracy. The problem originated on the right but it has parallels on the left. One of the by-products of the two world wars was that they bound the classes together. The politicians, financiers, business and media leaders who rose to the top from the 1930s to the 1970s were sensitive to the toughness of the lives of ordinary men and women. They had fought alongside and had depended on them; they knew they weren\u2019t the shirkers and societal enemies depicted by the right today. Equally, men had seen their officers fight and die alongside their pals. Whatever their weaknesses and privileges, at bottom they could be trusted. This was crucial for the construction of the Tory one-nation tradition \u2013 in politics and business alike. Conservatives such as Harold Macmillan or Ted Heath had served in war. Instinctively, they upheld the principles of the postwar settlement, just as business leaders wanted to run honourable companies that offered pensions, recognised unions and kept their own pay in touch with that of their workers. It was what you did. The entitlements that came with leadership were matched by responsibilities. You might have political opponents and adversaries but they were never despised enemies. Today, that has been shattered. The private equity and hedge fund barons who fund Boris Johnson along with the \u201cfuck business\u201d prime minister himself feel only entitlement \u2013 and no serious responsibility. They are entitled to great wealth because they are capitalist \u201cbuccaneers\u201d who create wealth; society is lucky to have them and plays no part in the wealth-creation process that is down to them alone. Skills, infrastructure, science \u2013 they are nice to have but essentially second-order concerns. The political task is to create a Britain fit for even more buccaneering, as free from tax and regulation as possible, especially free from the EU. A NHS hospital is a place for photo-opportunities rather than representative of an institution in whose values you believe and curate. Personally, your instinct is to go private, just as you were educated privately. One of the breathtaking aspects of David Cameron\u2019s memoir is his defence of austerity cast wholly in top-down terms. A more honourable and decent man than Johnson, he has nonetheless no conception of how the scale of the spending cuts he authored ripped through British society \u2013 or of the new precariousness of the British world of work. We could have done even more, he opines. I doubt that if he had fought on the Somme or across Normandy in 1944 \u2013 or had not been educated at Eton \u2013 he would have been so insouciant about the social impact. On the left, the Blair government, elected to make over Britain\u2019s economy and society, did not leave a sufficiently enduring trace. There is no network of loved institutions and systems embodying leftwing values impossible to dismantle because their function is so well understood. There is no system, say, of lifelong learning or public investment banks, nor a network of brilliant co-operatives, mutuals and employee-owned firms or a well-understood commitment to the EU. Instead, there was the Iraq war, covert, all-too-easy-to-reverse spending increases and an inadequate promotion of the European cause. It genuflected too much to the new responsibility-free elite, anxious to win their endorsement. Jeremy Corbyn, his coterie and Momentum are now the counterreaction. Yet while their commitment not to make the same mistakes is understandable and in some ways admirable, they are wildly overshooting and even more locked in their own self-defined universe beyond which everyone is an enemy. This provides the mirror image to Johnson and his malevolent troll, Dominic Cummings. Every business leader is perforce a member of the boss class; members of the Labour party beyond their group are collaborators and traitors. Their responsibility is to a particularly narrow socialism in whose name they seek to have unchallengeable control of the Labour party. For what purpose? To lead requires an anchored personality, a convinced sense of direction that others \u2013 beyond your allies in a political party or, indeed, in any organisation \u2013 can be persuaded to share because, at core, it is right. You should also have the capacity to reach out to build the coalitions to make it happen. Lacking such capabilities, Corbyn and his circle, notwithstanding the merits of some of their economic policies, supply the relentlessly attack-dog rightwing press with the ammunition to create impossibly negative ratings, of which the aborted attempt to unseat Tom Watson is but the latest example. It is a tragedy. Britain will face a collapsing World Trade Organization and a disintegrating global financial and trade order \u2013 but outside the safe harbour of the EU. What it requires is a broad-based left government that will seek to remain as close as possible to the EU \u2013 better still, within it \u2013 and fundamentally reset British capitalism and society. As matters stand, that is impossible.

      "body": "<p>It is not often that a person\u2019s character is revealed in two sentences. But it is tempting to believe that is the case with Katharine Gun.</p> <p>In 2003, Gun was working as a translator of Mandarin at the government intelligence agency, GCHQ, in Cheltenham. She was 27. The country, at the time, was being drummed into war by the Blair government, desperate to achieve the United Nations\u2019 sanction for the imminent American-led invasion of Iraq. In January that year, Katharine Gun was copied into a classified memo sent to GCHQ by a senior figure in the NSA, its US equivalent. The memo was a top-secret request to monitor the private communication of UN delegates for scraps of information, personal or otherwise, that could be used to \u201cgive the US an edge\u201d in leveraging support for the invasion. Katharine Gun leaked that memo to the <em>Observer</em>, in the belief that the revelation of the proposed bugging and blackmail tactics might be enough to stop the war.</p> <p>The <em>Observer </em>published the dirty tricks memo as a front-page splash just over two weeks before the invasion. Gun owned up to the leak a few days later to save her GCHQ colleagues from a witch-hunt. She was arrested and charged with breach of the Official Secrets Act. It was in a police cell that she uttered those two sentences that now seem to define the person she was and is. Gun was asked by Special Branch officers why she had chosen to act as she had. \u201cYou work for the British government,\u201d her interrogator said, with a sneer.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Gun replied, steadily. \u201cI work for the British people. I do not gather intelligence so the government can lie to the British people.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3f4f8f071e510c0770905eeae03768026982eee3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f4f8f071e510c0770905eeae03768026982eee3/0_0_4771_7075/674.jpg\" alt=\"The Observer\u2019s front page story on 2 March 2003.\" width=\"674\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Observer\u2019s front page story on 2 March 2003.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sixteen years have passed since Katharine Gun said those words, but they still ring in the air. Her whistleblowing was not enough to change the path of history, of course, and her last-gasp act of courage was all but forgotten in the brutal \u201cshock and awe\u201d of war. Truth has a habit of finding a voice, however. Gun\u2019s words will, in the coming weeks finally receive the much wider audience they deserve. A film, <em>Official Secrets,</em> has been made of her story. She is played, with steely English resolve, by Keira Knightley. Her performance reminds you of the sentiment of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/daniel-ellsberg\" title=\"\">Daniel Ellsberg</a>, the man who famously leaked the Pentagon Papers to the <em>New York Times</em> in 1971, revealing the full truth of American involvement in Vietnam. Ellsberg has called Katharine Gun\u2019s action \u201cthe most important and courageous leak I have ever seen. No one else \u2013 including myself \u2013 has ever done what Gun did: tell secret truths at personal risk, before an imminent war, in time, possibly, to avert it.\u201d</p> <p>The legal case against Gun was eventually <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/feb/26/iraq.freedomofinformation\" title=\"\">dropped by the British government</a> in 2004, after her lawyer, Ben Emmerson QC (played in the film with fabulous charisma by Ralph Fiennes), threatened to use disclosure to put the legal basis of the war itself on trial. Gun had, of course, been forced to abandon her career in the civil service and finally, struggling for work, left Britain altogether. For the past nine years she has been living in Turkey with her Turkish husband and their 11-year-old daughter. I met her in August in Durham, when she was on a brief visit to see her father. We sat in the bar of a city centre hotel, and talked about the ancient history of 2003.</p> <p>There have been other attempts to make a film over the years. One foundered for lack of funds, another strayed further from the truth than she would have liked. When Gun was approached with the idea for a script by Gavin Hood (who had recently made <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/17/eye-in-the-sky-review-helen-mirren\" title=\"\">Eye in the Sky</a></em>, the film about drone warfare, with Helen Mirren), the pair of them first talked for five days in London, getting the story straight. I ask her first if it is gratifying to finally have it out there?</p> <p>Gun is a singular presence, and she answers with characteristic care, speaking slightly haltingly, weighing her words. She grew up in Taiwan, where her father had gone to teach, and her accent is hard to place. \u201cThat is a difficult question,\u201d she says. \u201cBefore I was charged, before my name came out, my biggest worry was that I would become a known person. After the case was dropped I did some media for 24 hours and then I immediately decided to run away and hide and not pursue the story any more. The comedown after they dropped the case, and trying to recover from that, was quite stressful.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP4zhzIyTUA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pP4zhzIyTUA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP4zhzIyTUA\">Watch a trailer for Official Secrets.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Because it offered her both a resolution, and none?</p> <p>\u201cOn the one hand I was relieved because my life wouldn\u2019t have to be scrutinised in court. But a part of me thought: \u2018Damn \u2013 we could have put the war on trial\u2019. And the potential chink in the Official Secrets Act we had found, which could have become a defence for others, the \u2018defence of necessity\u2019 [of speaking up to save imminent danger to life], it wasn\u2019t tested in court.\u201d</p> <p>Some of the information that would have been revealed at her trial, in particular Lord Goldsmith\u2019s \u201cconflicting arguments\u201d as to the legality of the invasion, did not fully emerge until the publication of the report of the Chilcot inquiry in 2016. In its absence, Tony Blair won another election in 2005. Gun is grimly amused to see his current return to the moral high ground over Brexit.</p> <p>How many times has she seen the film now?</p> <p>\u201cI have sat through it once.\u201d</p> <p>What kind of experience was that?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef261702cbd907fff3944fea219149cd16bd3e8c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef261702cbd907fff3944fea219149cd16bd3e8c/0_0_5761_3841/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Keira Knightley as Katharine Gun in the film Official Secrets.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Keira Knightley as Katharine Gun in the film Official Secrets.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Sundance Institute</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI watched it in San Francisco, at the premiere, and my friend from childhood who lived there was with me. It was weird. It was like watching a case that was very similar to my own. There is a sense of, \u2018Did it really happen?\u2019 \u2018Is that really me?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Presumably the events mark a before and after in her life. Did everything change?</p> <p>\u201cYes and no. My GCHQ career obviously came to an end. Certain friends did not want to see me any more, or be seen with me \u2013 some people get very paranoid. But my closest friends stuck by me.\u201d</p> <p>Does she tell her story when she meets new people?</p> <p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p> <p>How did she go about rebuilding her life?</p> <p>\u201cIt was very difficult initially. Just trying to figure out what to do next. I was very concerned about joining any kind of organisation like Stop the War, and being used as a focal point or something. I didn\u2019t want to be that. So I tried to look for work. I took up teaching. I was teaching Mandarin in the local college in Cheltenham. I ended up, bizarrely, teaching a couple of my former colleagues at GCHQ. In the very typical British manner, we just pretended we had never met.\u201d</p> <p>The side of that history that Gun didn\u2019t really know in its fullest detail until she worked on the film was the drama of how the story made it into the pages of the <em>Observer</em>. The second act of the movie is concerned with the internal newspaper politics of that decision. At the time, as I well remember, the paper was split in response to the talk of war. The official editorial line, led by the then editor Roger Alton (now an executive editor at the <em>Daily Mail</em>) and political editor Kamal Ahmed (now editorial director of BBC News) was in close support of the Blair government\u2019s position on the invasion. Much of the news desk was opposed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"72417d8d7d24e0d8bfea2329c3c8089212392178\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/72417d8d7d24e0d8bfea2329c3c8089212392178/0_16_2464_1478/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Katharine Gun outside the Old Bailey after charges had been dropped against her, 2004.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Katharine Gun outside the Old Bailey after charges had been dropped against her, 2004.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Sillitoe/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gun had given a copy of the memo, with no supporting verification, to a friend of a friend who eventually brought it to the <em>Observer</em>\u2019s investigative reporter Martin Bright. The film captures well the inspired and stubborn efforts of Bright (Matt Smith in the movie), and colleagues Ed Vulliamy (played with brio by Rhys Ifans) and Peter Beaumont (played by Matthew Goode), to stand the story up, based on the few details it betrayed, and to get it into the paper, despite the strong misgivings of the political desk.</p> <p>Bright has also been closely involved with the film. He left the <em>Observer</em> not long after the events it describes and now runs the <a href=\"https://www.thecreativesociety.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Creative Society</a>, a charity that helps widen access to jobs in the media and the arts to candidates with non-traditional backgrounds. When Bright\u2019s story originally landed there were concentrated efforts to rubbish it in the gung-ho parts of the media. The online Drudge Report used the fact that the reproduced NSA memo used English spelling to cast doubt on its veracity. (In fact, those \u201c-our\u201d and \u201c-ise\u201d endings had been introduced by an <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/27/international-incident-work-mistake-official-secrets-film\" title=\"\">Observer</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/27/international-incident-work-mistake-official-secrets-film\" title=\"\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/27/international-incident-work-mistake-official-secrets-film\" title=\"\">editorial assistant</a>, innocently following house style guidelines as she copied out the memo into the system.) The argument was then subsumed by the war.</p> <p>Film-makers generally like to glamorise newspaper offices, making them <em>All the President\u2019s Men</em> hothouses of high-level argument and intrigue. Director Gavin Hood resists this for the most part \u2013 though I can\u2019t recall Martin being applauded into the office the morning after the story broke (muttered sarcasm and grudging praise was more likely the tone). As well as illuminating Gun\u2019s story, though, the film gives what was, by any standards, one of the great scoops of recent British journalism the credit that is long overdue.</p> <p>Bright\u2019s story was news to Gun herself, to a large degree. \u201cI hadn\u2019t realised the extent to which Martin in particular had gone out on a limb for this at the paper. I think of journalists as being bullet-proof in a way,\u201d she says, \u201cbut obviously not.\u201d</p> <p>She and Bright have done several question and answer sessions in the US after the film has been screened at various festivals. One question that recurs, she says, comes from audience members asking what they should do, how they should behave, in the current mendacious political climate. There is no single answer to that, she says, but Bright had the best stab at it: \u201cThe only thing you can do is do your job right, and be a good citizen.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"72ae45abe2227f6682f6928565b8ac7821b2b6a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/72ae45abe2227f6682f6928565b8ac7821b2b6a7/0_0_5603_3735/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Observer team in a scene from the film, with Matt Smith, front, as home affairs editor Martin Bright.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Observer team in a scene from the film, with Matt Smith, front, as home affairs editor Martin Bright.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: IFC Films/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIn other words,\u201d she says, \u201cwhatever your job is, do the things that you are supposed to do. If you are a journalist, check and double-check your sources. Don\u2019t just swallow what politicians tell you. And if you are working in government, make sure that you are really clued up about what is going on, and think very hard where your responsibility lies.\u201d</p> <p>How often does she go through that fateful weekend, where she wrestled with her conscience after seeing the memo?</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Did she surprise herself at the time?</p> <p>\u201cThat is a tricky question,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was in character, I think. I grew up in Taiwan, which was a military dictatorship. I heard things that stuck. My childhood friend, for example, I remember hearing her father was on a blacklist because he had been agitating for the opposition\u2026\u201d</p> <p>So her moral certainty was rooted in those formative experiences?</p> <p>\u201cNobody knows if whistleblowing is nurture or nature. I think most people have red lines that they won\u2019t cross. Some people have very low tolerance of wrongdoing, whether it is fiddling expenses, or whatever. With me, it was this. I was very exercised about what was happening. And the memo was like this big red flag as soon as I saw it.\u201d</p> <p>Was she immediately frightened of the consequences?</p> <p>\u201cI was aware I was doing something I wasn\u2019t supposed to be doing. But I felt this information was explosive, it needed to get out. I am currently reading a book about how to blow the whistle. The author advocates anonymity. But that is unbelievably difficult now especially in the digital world.\u201d</p> <p>Gun\u2019s leak was perhaps the last example of whistleblowing that involved a red telephone box and a photocopier, rather than downloads.

      "bodyText": "It is not often that a person\u2019s character is revealed in two sentences. But it is tempting to believe that is the case with Katharine Gun. In 2003, Gun was working as a translator of Mandarin at the government intelligence agency, GCHQ, in Cheltenham. She was 27. The country, at the time, was being drummed into war by the Blair government, desperate to achieve the United Nations\u2019 sanction for the imminent American-led invasion of Iraq. In January that year, Katharine Gun was copied into a classified memo sent to GCHQ by a senior figure in the NSA, its US equivalent. The memo was a top-secret request to monitor the private communication of UN delegates for scraps of information, personal or otherwise, that could be used to \u201cgive the US an edge\u201d in leveraging support for the invasion. Katharine Gun leaked that memo to the Observer, in the belief that the revelation of the proposed bugging and blackmail tactics might be enough to stop the war. The Observer published the dirty tricks memo as a front-page splash just over two weeks before the invasion. Gun owned up to the leak a few days later to save her GCHQ colleagues from a witch-hunt. She was arrested and charged with breach of the Official Secrets Act. It was in a police cell that she uttered those two sentences that now seem to define the person she was and is. Gun was asked by Special Branch officers why she had chosen to act as she had. \u201cYou work for the British government,\u201d her interrogator said, with a sneer. \u201cNo,\u201d Gun replied, steadily. \u201cI work for the British people. I do not gather intelligence so the government can lie to the British people.\u201d Sixteen years have passed since Katharine Gun said those words, but they still ring in the air. Her whistleblowing was not enough to change the path of history, of course, and her last-gasp act of courage was all but forgotten in the brutal \u201cshock and awe\u201d of war. Truth has a habit of finding a voice, however. Gun\u2019s words will, in the coming weeks finally receive the much wider audience they deserve. A film, Official Secrets, has been made of her story. She is played, with steely English resolve, by Keira Knightley. Her performance reminds you of the sentiment of Daniel Ellsberg, the man who famously leaked the Pentagon Papers to the New York Times in 1971, revealing the full truth of American involvement in Vietnam. Ellsberg has called Katharine Gun\u2019s action \u201cthe most important and courageous leak I have ever seen. No one else \u2013 including myself \u2013 has ever done what Gun did: tell secret truths at personal risk, before an imminent war, in time, possibly, to avert it.\u201d The legal case against Gun was eventually dropped by the British government in 2004, after her lawyer, Ben Emmerson QC (played in the film with fabulous charisma by Ralph Fiennes), threatened to use disclosure to put the legal basis of the war itself on trial. Gun had, of course, been forced to abandon her career in the civil service and finally, struggling for work, left Britain altogether. For the past nine years she has been living in Turkey with her Turkish husband and their 11-year-old daughter. I met her in August in Durham, when she was on a brief visit to see her father. We sat in the bar of a city centre hotel, and talked about the ancient history of 2003. There have been other attempts to make a film over the years. One foundered for lack of funds, another strayed further from the truth than she would have liked. When Gun was approached with the idea for a script by Gavin Hood (who had recently made Eye in the Sky, the film about drone warfare, with Helen Mirren), the pair of them first talked for five days in London, getting the story straight. I ask her first if it is gratifying to finally have it out there? Gun is a singular presence, and she answers with characteristic care, speaking slightly haltingly, weighing her words. She grew up in Taiwan, where her father had gone to teach, and her accent is hard to place. \u201cThat is a difficult question,\u201d she says. \u201cBefore I was charged, before my name came out, my biggest worry was that I would become a known person. After the case was dropped I did some media for 24 hours and then I immediately decided to run away and hide and not pursue the story any more. The comedown after they dropped the case, and trying to recover from that, was quite stressful.\u201d Because it offered her both a resolution, and none? \u201cOn the one hand I was relieved because my life wouldn\u2019t have to be scrutinised in court. But a part of me thought: \u2018Damn \u2013 we could have put the war on trial\u2019. And the potential chink in the Official Secrets Act we had found, which could have become a defence for others, the \u2018defence of necessity\u2019 [of speaking up to save imminent danger to life], it wasn\u2019t tested in court.\u201d Some of the information that would have been revealed at her trial, in particular Lord Goldsmith\u2019s \u201cconflicting arguments\u201d as to the legality of the invasion, did not fully emerge until the publication of the report of the Chilcot inquiry in 2016. In its absence, Tony Blair won another election in 2005. Gun is grimly amused to see his current return to the moral high ground over Brexit. How many times has she seen the film now? \u201cI have sat through it once.\u201d What kind of experience was that? \u201cI watched it in San Francisco, at the premiere, and my friend from childhood who lived there was with me. It was weird. It was like watching a case that was very similar to my own. There is a sense of, \u2018Did it really happen?\u2019 \u2018Is that really me?\u2019\u201d Presumably the events mark a before and after in her life. Did everything change? \u201cYes and no. My GCHQ career obviously came to an end. Certain friends did not want to see me any more, or be seen with me \u2013 some people get very paranoid. But my closest friends stuck by me.\u201d Does she tell her story when she meets new people? \u201cNever.\u201d How did she go about rebuilding her life? \u201cIt was very difficult initially. Just trying to figure out what to do next. I was very concerned about joining any kind of organisation like Stop the War, and being used as a focal point or something. I didn\u2019t want to be that. So I tried to look for work. I took up teaching. I was teaching Mandarin in the local college in Cheltenham. I ended up, bizarrely, teaching a couple of my former colleagues at GCHQ. In the very typical British manner, we just pretended we had never met.\u201d The side of that history that Gun didn\u2019t really know in its fullest detail until she worked on the film was the drama of how the story made it into the pages of the Observer. The second act of the movie is concerned with the internal newspaper politics of that decision. At the time, as I well remember, the paper was split in response to the talk of war. The official editorial line, led by the then editor Roger Alton (now an executive editor at the Daily Mail) and political editor Kamal Ahmed (now editorial director of BBC News) was in close support of the Blair government\u2019s position on the invasion. Much of the news desk was opposed. Gun had given a copy of the memo, with no supporting verification, to a friend of a friend who eventually brought it to the Observer\u2019s investigative reporter Martin Bright. The film captures well the inspired and stubborn efforts of Bright (Matt Smith in the movie), and colleagues Ed Vulliamy (played with brio by Rhys Ifans) and Peter Beaumont (played by Matthew Goode), to stand the story up, based on the few details it betrayed, and to get it into the paper, despite the strong misgivings of the political desk. Bright has also been closely involved with the film. He left the Observer not long after the events it describes and now runs the Creative Society, a charity that helps widen access to jobs in the media and the arts to candidates with non-traditional backgrounds. When Bright\u2019s story originally landed there were concentrated efforts to rubbish it in the gung-ho parts of the media. The online Drudge Report used the fact that the reproduced NSA memo used English spelling to cast doubt on its veracity. (In fact, those \u201c-our\u201d and \u201c-ise\u201d endings had been introduced by an Observer editorial assistant, innocently following house style guidelines as she copied out the memo into the system.) The argument was then subsumed by the war. Film-makers generally like to glamorise newspaper offices, making them All the President\u2019s Men hothouses of high-level argument and intrigue. Director Gavin Hood resists this for the most part \u2013 though I can\u2019t recall Martin being applauded into the office the morning after the story broke (muttered sarcasm and grudging praise was more likely the tone). As well as illuminating Gun\u2019s story, though, the film gives what was, by any standards, one of the great scoops of recent British journalism the credit that is long overdue. Bright\u2019s story was news to Gun herself, to a large degree. \u201cI hadn\u2019t realised the extent to which Martin in particular had gone out on a limb for this at the paper. I think of journalists as being bullet-proof in a way,\u201d she says, \u201cbut obviously not.\u201d She and Bright have done several question and answer sessions in the US after the film has been screened at various festivals. One question that recurs, she says, comes from audience members asking what they should do, how they should behave, in the current mendacious political climate. There is no single answer to that, she says, but Bright had the best stab at it: \u201cThe only thing you can do is do your job right, and be a good citizen.\u201d \u201cIn other words,\u201d she says, \u201cwhatever your job is, do the things that you are supposed to do. If you are a journalist, check and double-check your sources. Don\u2019t just swallow what politicians tell you. And if you are working in government, make sure that you are really clued up about what is going on, and think very hard where your responsibility lies.\u201d How often does she go through that fateful weekend, where she wrestled with her conscience after seeing the memo? \u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d she says. Did she surprise herself at the time? \u201cThat is a tricky question,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was in character, I think. I grew up in Taiwan, which was a military dictatorship. I heard things that stuck. My childhood friend, for example, I remember hearing her father was on a blacklist because he had been agitating for the opposition\u2026\u201d So her moral certainty was rooted in those formative experiences? \u201cNobody knows if whistleblowing is nurture or nature. I think most people have red lines that they won\u2019t cross. Some people have very low tolerance of wrongdoing, whether it is fiddling expenses, or whatever. With me, it was this. I was very exercised about what was happening. And the memo was like this big red flag as soon as I saw it.\u201d Was she immediately frightened of the consequences? \u201cI was aware I was doing something I wasn\u2019t supposed to be doing. But I felt this information was explosive, it needed to get out. I am currently reading a book about how to blow the whistle. The author advocates anonymity. But that is unbelievably difficult now especially in the digital world.\u201d Gun\u2019s leak was perhaps the last example of whistleblowing that involved a red telephone box and a photocopier, rather than downloads. I wonder what she made of the scattershot download methods of Edward Snowden and Julian Assange? \u201cI haven\u2019t watched the films about either of them,\u201d she says. \u201cGiven my experience I would want to hear what happened from the horse\u2019s mouth, I think.\u201d I mention those lines about working for the people rather than the government. Does she think that was a unique belief among colleagues at GCHQ? \u201cWe didn\u2019t talk about politics much. You don\u2019t do you? We were mostly in our mid-20s, so it was the usual stuff, who is going out with who. What I did is a very unusual thing to do, because the results are not generally good. But I wasn\u2019t thinking about myself really. I wanted to stop bombs dropping on Iraq.\u201d The consequences have been damaging not just for Gun\u2019s career.

Taylor told the ABC\u2019s Insiders program that he disclosed to Frydenberg \u2013 then environment and energy minister \u2013 his family\u2019s interest before meeting with the bureaucrats. \u201cMy obligation is to disclose to the parliament and to the prime minister,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThe minister, which was Josh Frydenberg at the time, was also aware, so there was no lack of disclosure and compliance on this.\u201d Taylor, now the energy minister, defended his intervention on the regulations \u2013 despite his family\u2019s farm having a compliance action issued against it \u2013 saying he was representing the concerns of constituents in his regional electorate of Hume. \u201cI have stayed at arm\u2019s length at all times from that compliance matter,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve argued for farmers in my electorate who deserve advocacy and representation on an issue affecting them ... Farmers need representation, and I will do it every day of the week,\u201d he said. The 2017 meeting took place in Taylor\u2019s Parliament House office, attended by Taylor, environment department officials, and staff from Frydenberg\u2019s office. No notes were taken by the officials present, Senate committee questions have revealed. Taylor did not disclose the interest to the officials at the meeting. However, internal emails obtained by Guardian Australia show the department officials were acutely sensitive about meeting with Taylor while his family\u2019s company was being investigated. At the time of the meeting with Taylor, state and federal investigations were under way into whether Jam Land Pty Ltd illegally poisoned 30 hectares of land containing native temperate grasses \u2013 considered an endangered ecological community under federal environment laws \u2013 in the Monaro region. Angus Taylor\u2019s brother, Richard, is one of the directors of Jam Land and the minister himself holds an interest in the firm via his family investment company, Gufee. After Taylor met with Frydenberg\u2019s office, Frydenberg asked his department whether he had the power to weaken the grasslands\u2019 protection \u2013 and if any change had to be published. No changes were made to the grass species\u2019 critically endangered listing, which had been upgraded from endangered. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Labor\u2019s environment spokeswoman, Terri Butler, said Frydenberg, now treasurer, \u201chad questions to answers on what he knew about Jam Land and when\u201d. \u201cJosh Frydenberg must now come clean on when he knew about Taylor\u2019s interests in the property.\u201d The 2018 statement of ministerial standards insists ministers must \u201cmake arrangements to avoid conflicts of interests arising from their investments\u201d and \u201cit is critical that ministers do not use public office for private purposes\u201d. In response on Sunday Frydenberg issued a statement: \u201cAs the member for Hume (Taylor) has said in the parliament: \u2018my indirect interest in Jam Land, through my family company, has been widely reported in the media and was declared in accordance with the rules, through my family company\u2019.\u201d Labor is concerned the minister didn\u2019t properly disclose his interest in the company, pointing to department answers to Senate committee questions and a freedom of information request that show no records of the minister declaring his interest in Jam Land to the bureaucrats. with agencies",

      "body": "<p>Last Sunday, Rony Marceline was riding his motorbike out of Ouanaminthe, a muggy, colourful town on Haiti\u2019s border with the Dominican Republic, on a mission that within a few days has become commonplace: transporting yellow plastic containers of petrol. He hit a lorry and the canister split, enveloping him and his passenger, an as yet unnamed woman, in flames.</p> <p>Until that moment, the newly necessary practice of carrying cans of fuel had been the subject of meme humour in this country where the petrol is running out and the usually intense traffic is stuttering to a halt. In one, an elegant woman carries a can under the caption: \u201cthe new accessory\u201d. But now there is no joking: now the whole country is ready to explode.</p> <p>Haiti, on the western end of Hispaniola, has fallen to depths its people cannot fathom. Protests, continuing into this weekend, have seen roads across the country blocked with rocks, trees and burning tyres, while in the capital, Port-au-Prince, senators engaged in fist-fights on the floor of the senate. The president, Jovenel Mo\u00efse, was due to fly to the UN on Sunday, his authority draining away.</p> <p>\u201cIt feels like something is going to break, and it needs to,\u201d says Marie Pascal, an economist.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>\u2018Most Haitians would now be willing to work in conditions only just short of slavery\u2019</p> <footer> <cite>Didier Dominique, historian</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis president has to go. The parliament has to go. There has to be something new,\u201d says Lyonel Trouillot, a revered novelist.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t remember a situation this bad,\u201d says Leslie Voltaire, an architect and former presidential candidate.</p> <p>This view \u2013 that it has never been so bad \u2013 is repeated again and again across a country that has suffered, in living memory, the Papa and Baby Doc Duvalier dictatorships, a US invasion, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2015/jan/16/the-haiti-earthquake-five-years-on-then-and-now\" title=\"\">2010 earthquake</a> that claimed up to 300,000 lives.</p> <p>And the anger is worsened by wounded pride. This is the nation born in 1804 from a successful slave revolt. The walls of its cities show murals of the heroes Toussaint and Dessalines in Napoleonic bicorn hats. It\u2019s a history Haitians believe the world ignores due to racism, preferring instead Donald Trump\u2019s claim that Haiti is a \u201cshithole\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/09/archive-zip/giv-3902RgyEpQBfez49/\" data-alt=\"haiti location map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/09/archive-zip/giv-3902RgyEpQBfez49/\">haiti location map</a> </figure>  <p>With postcard-pretty houses, glistening beaches and fortress-topped mountains, Haiti makes a mockery of that insult, but it\u2019s true its governance is a shambles. President Mo\u00efse has been attempting to install an inexperienced prime minister, Fritz-William Michel, but Michel is beset by allegations of corruption, including the claim that he used government funds to buy thousands of overpriced goats from one of his own companies. He has denied the allegations.</p> <p>Meanwhile unemployment stands at over 70%, per capita annual income at $350 and inflation at 19%, while the economy is propped up by $2.7bn of remittances sent in by Haitians abroad, representing a third of GDP. Trade is controlled in a large part by Dominicans, and what assets the country has are in the hands of a few super-rich families, fuelling poisonous resentment.</p> <p>The ongoing protests have been caused by the fuel running out. Successive governments have kept the price low by first getting supplies from socialist Venezuela, then through subsidies. But the state can no longer pay \u2013 and with outstanding bills of $63m, the fuel companies are no longer supplying. Prices have to rise, and with them the cost of food.</p> <p>Sitting in the shadow of a mango tree, in the Yanvalou restaurant on the side of the mountain above Port-au-Prince, is Didier Dominique. He runs Lakou Bovwa, a religious site that preserves the legacy of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/13/voodoo-haiti-supreme-chief-max-beauvoir-dies\" title=\"\">Max Beauvoir</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/13/voodoo-haiti-supreme-chief-max-beauvoir-dies\" title=\"\">,</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/13/voodoo-haiti-supreme-chief-max-beauvoir-dies\" title=\"\"> a famed supreme </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/13/voodoo-haiti-supreme-chief-max-beauvoir-dies\" title=\"\">servitur</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/13/voodoo-haiti-supreme-chief-max-beauvoir-dies\" title=\"\"> of the voodoo priesthood</a>.

He talks of the danger of Nicolas Duvalier \u2013 Grandbaby Doc if you like \u2013 who has been canvassing for support among expats in Miami. Is there a constituency for a member of the tyrannical family who ruled Haiti through fear from 1957 to 1986?</p> <p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d says Dominique. \u201cAmong small business people. I met one. He wants to make nails, but the Bigio family, who has the monopoly on steel here, pushed him out. That is the type of person who would support Nicolas, and there are many more like him.\u201d</p> <p>On the other side of the border there\u2019s another belch from the past. Haitians have long crossed into the Dominican Republic to find work. Back in 1937, the Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo ordered an <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-19880967\" title=\"\">ethnic cleansing that saw an estimated 20,000 Haitians killed</a>. That might seem long ago, but Trujillo\u2019s grandson Ramfis is running for president in next year\u2019s Dominican elections, and on a hardline anti-Haitian platform.</p> <p>\u201cTrump is the one following me because I started talking about the wall before he did,\u201d Ramfis told a fundraising event in the US late last year. \u201cWe will have to build a wall from north to south.\u201d This despite, as Dominique says, \u201call those gleaming towers in Santo Domingo being built by Haitians\u201d.</p> <p>Last week, a video circulated among Dominicans claiming that Haitians were storming the border, and showing people running past burning cars. At that moment, I was walking towards the border where it runs along the morbidly named Rio Massacre in the north. My guide, Bulos Riche, pointed to two streets that led to the river, and asked if I wanted the \u201clegal or illegal crossing\u201d. Then he paused and said his grandfather only survived 1937 by swimming.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"64f68bbc933b4af5a5ee97fb4ec72c5c638656d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64f68bbc933b4af5a5ee97fb4ec72c5c638656d6/0_259_3888_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Residents block a street with their cars in a protest at fuel shortages in Port-au-Prince.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Residents block a street with their cars in a protest at fuel shortages in Port-au-Prince.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dieu Nalio Chery/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the legal crossing, Haitians <em>were</em> crossing the border, but towards home. Many were on motorbikes with contraband tanks of petrol, and I watched as they politely bribed the Dominicans guarding the gates.</p> <p>There is a saying in Haiti: \u201cAs heavy as a 50lb weight.\u201d You can see one in Port-au-Prince\u2019s Pantheon, where the heroes of independence are celebrated; it\u2019s what plantation owners would place on the heads of slave girls who had aborted their babies. Pride in the achievement of freedom is the most striking thing about the country. Yet, in the words of Dominique, \u201cmost Haitians would now be willing to work in conditions just short of slavery, and many already are in the textile factories\u201d.</p> <p>The tension can be heard on the streets. Several times, people tell me that the super-rich are \u201cforeigners\u201d, despite having been Haitian for generations. Beautifully stencilled graffiti \u2013 Haiti is a very artistic country \u2013 have appeared on walls showing a noose and the words, in Creole, \u201cthe money or the rope\u201d. Dominique hands over a copy of \u201csitiyasyon \u2013 aksyon\u201d, a Creole pamphlet being circulated by Batay Ouvriye (working-class struggle). For the most part a Marxist analysis of the situation, it ends with a call for the creation of an armed wing, for \u201cself protection\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Last Sunday, Rony Marceline was riding his motorbike out of Ouanaminthe, a muggy, colourful town on Haiti\u2019s border with the Dominican Republic, on a mission that within a few days has become commonplace: transporting yellow plastic containers of petrol. He hit a lorry and the canister split, enveloping him and his passenger, an as yet unnamed woman, in flames. Until that moment, the newly necessary practice of carrying cans of fuel had been the subject of meme humour in this country where the petrol is running out and the usually intense traffic is stuttering to a halt. In one, an elegant woman carries a can under the caption: \u201cthe new accessory\u201d. But now there is no joking: now the whole country is ready to explode. Haiti, on the western end of Hispaniola, has fallen to depths its people cannot fathom. Protests, continuing into this weekend, have seen roads across the country blocked with rocks, trees and burning tyres, while in the capital, Port-au-Prince, senators engaged in fist-fights on the floor of the senate. The president, Jovenel Mo\u00efse, was due to fly to the UN on Sunday, his authority draining away. \u201cIt feels like something is going to break, and it needs to,\u201d says Marie Pascal, an economist. \u201cThis president has to go. The parliament has to go. There has to be something new,\u201d says Lyonel Trouillot, a revered novelist. \u201cI can\u2019t remember a situation this bad,\u201d says Leslie Voltaire, an architect and former presidential candidate. This view \u2013 that it has never been so bad \u2013 is repeated again and again across a country that has suffered, in living memory, the Papa and Baby Doc Duvalier dictatorships, a US invasion, and the 2010 earthquake that claimed up to 300,000 lives. And the anger is worsened by wounded pride. This is the nation born in 1804 from a successful slave revolt. The walls of its cities show murals of the heroes Toussaint and Dessalines in Napoleonic bicorn hats. It\u2019s a history Haitians believe the world ignores due to racism, preferring instead Donald Trump\u2019s claim that Haiti is a \u201cshithole\u201d. With postcard-pretty houses, glistening beaches and fortress-topped mountains, Haiti makes a mockery of that insult, but it\u2019s true its governance is a shambles. President Mo\u00efse has been attempting to install an inexperienced prime minister, Fritz-William Michel, but Michel is beset by allegations of corruption, including the claim that he used government funds to buy thousands of overpriced goats from one of his own companies. He has denied the allegations. Meanwhile unemployment stands at over 70%, per capita annual income at $350 and inflation at 19%, while the economy is propped up by $2.7bn of remittances sent in by Haitians abroad, representing a third of GDP. Trade is controlled in a large part by Dominicans, and what assets the country has are in the hands of a few super-rich families, fuelling poisonous resentment. The ongoing protests have been caused by the fuel running out. Successive governments have kept the price low by first getting supplies from socialist Venezuela, then through subsidies. But the state can no longer pay \u2013 and with outstanding bills of $63m, the fuel companies are no longer supplying. Prices have to rise, and with them the cost of food. Sitting in the shadow of a mango tree, in the Yanvalou restaurant on the side of the mountain above Port-au-Prince, is Didier Dominique. He runs Lakou Bovwa, a religious site that preserves the legacy of Max Beauvoir, a famed supreme servitur of the voodoo priesthood. Dominique knows his country. In the 1970s, he helped restore the extraordinary post-independence fortress of Citadelle Laferri\u00e8re, and in the 1980s and 1990s he travelled the nation to identify historically important sites. He is certain that something is going to break, but not the direction it will take. He talks of the danger of Nicolas Duvalier \u2013 Grandbaby Doc if you like \u2013 who has been canvassing for support among expats in Miami. Is there a constituency for a member of the tyrannical family who ruled Haiti through fear from 1957 to 1986? \u201cOh yes,\u201d says Dominique. \u201cAmong small business people. I met one. He wants to make nails, but the Bigio family, who has the monopoly on steel here, pushed him out. That is the type of person who would support Nicolas, and there are many more like him.\u201d On the other side of the border there\u2019s another belch from the past. Haitians have long crossed into the Dominican Republic to find work. Back in 1937, the Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo ordered an ethnic cleansing that saw an estimated 20,000 Haitians killed. That might seem long ago, but Trujillo\u2019s grandson Ramfis is running for president in next year\u2019s Dominican elections, and on a hardline anti-Haitian platform. \u201cTrump is the one following me because I started talking about the wall before he did,\u201d Ramfis told a fundraising event in the US late last year. \u201cWe will have to build a wall from north to south.\u201d This despite, as Dominique says, \u201call those gleaming towers in Santo Domingo being built by Haitians\u201d. Last week, a video circulated among Dominicans claiming that Haitians were storming the border, and showing people running past burning cars. At that moment, I was walking towards the border where it runs along the morbidly named Rio Massacre in the north. My guide, Bulos Riche, pointed to two streets that led to the river, and asked if I wanted the \u201clegal or illegal crossing\u201d. Then he paused and said his grandfather only survived 1937 by swimming. At the legal crossing, Haitians were crossing the border, but towards home. Many were on motorbikes with contraband tanks of petrol, and I watched as they politely bribed the Dominicans guarding the gates. There is a saying in Haiti: \u201cAs heavy as a 50lb weight.\u201d You can see one in Port-au-Prince\u2019s Pantheon, where the heroes of independence are celebrated; it\u2019s what plantation owners would place on the heads of slave girls who had aborted their babies. Pride in the achievement of freedom is the most striking thing about the country. Yet, in the words of Dominique, \u201cmost Haitians would now be willing to work in conditions just short of slavery, and many already are in the textile factories\u201d. The tension can be heard on the streets. Several times, people tell me that the super-rich are \u201cforeigners\u201d, despite having been Haitian for generations. Beautifully stencilled graffiti \u2013 Haiti is a very artistic country \u2013 have appeared on walls showing a noose and the words, in Creole, \u201cthe money or the rope\u201d. Dominique hands over a copy of \u201csitiyasyon \u2013 aksyon\u201d, a Creole pamphlet being circulated by Batay Ouvriye (working-class struggle). For the most part a Marxist analysis of the situation, it ends with a call for the creation of an armed wing, for \u201cself protection\u201d. Opposition parties are calling for further national strikes. Trouillot is certain an uprising is coming: \u201cMaybe not in the next two weeks,\u201d he says. \u201cBut within the next four months.\u201d On the other side of the bridge over the Rio Massacre lies Ouanaminthe and the bustling corner where Rony Marceline began his final journey last Sunday. Barbers offer their services under signs in Creole saying \u201cGod is my boss\u201d. Money changers work in the shade. I watch a funeral procession pass, a band at its head, mourners as elegant and proud as any to be seen in New Orleans. I am standing with Joseph Theonone, who knew Marceline well.

Seven tries they ran over, it wasn\u2019t a kicking game at all. Thankfully. However, Namibia acquitted themselves very well in reply, with three tries of their own. It could have turned into a pasting with an Italian try just before the half and just afterwards, but Namibia fought it out and scored a couple of times as well as defending with desperation all the way to the end.

      "bodyText": "And here\u2019s the first try for Namibia, one that\u2019s worth watching a few times. They\u2019re bottom of the group though, and for the time being Italy are top of the group above New Zealand. Enjoy it, Azzurri! Here\u2019s our match report. You can bookmark this page for the rest of the tournament: this is our guide to the RWC2019 pools and results. A strong enough performance from Italy in the end, and I think that might be their highest World Cup score. Seven tries they ran over, it wasn\u2019t a kicking game at all. Thankfully. However, Namibia acquitted themselves very well in reply, with three tries of their own. It could have turned into a pasting with an Italian try just before the half and just afterwards, but Namibia fought it out and scored a couple of times as well as defending with desperation all the way to the end. Entertaining rugby for the most part, and a good start for Italy before they take on Canada in a few days. 80 min: Namibia get a penalty as Budd infringes in the ruck, but can do nothing with it. An Italian kick for touch ends the game. Brilliance from Plato! Kick-off well forward for Namibia, and eventually the Italians kick for touch. Namibia run their line-out to perfection, then spread to the centre for Loubser. He fakes, then passes the other way. There is just a tiny gap, the door closing, but Plato hits it hard and at pace, and bursts through. Then has the speed of foot to run away from two tacklers, around the last defender, and dive over under serious attention. He created the first try, now he scores the last. Loubser converts from in front. Another Italy penalty, and Canna kicks for touch inside the 22 once more. Italy try the driving maul once again. This time the Namibian defence near the scrum is tougher. So the Italians spread wide, all the way to the far side, and Matteo Minozzi is there! Ignoring the outside option, diving over the last defender, takes a hit from the side, and gets over for Italy\u2019s seventh. Canna from a tight angle converts. 74 min: Italy nearly score again, but some last-line desperation from Namibia results in a box kick to clear. A simple set-piece. The throw to the front of the line-out, only about 10 metres from the try line, which quickly transforms into a maul, and around from behind it comes Polledri with the ball to barge over. Canna misses the conversion. 69 min: Italy away from the scrum: Parisse, Canna, an excellent low pick-up from Padovani, but when he\u2019s tackled the ref calls them back for a penalty on the scrum. Italy kick for touch rather than goal. 67 min: More handling errors from both sides with the wet and slippery ball. Passes are slipping low, receives are slipping out. Italy will get a scrum feed at around the 22. Tromp is coming off for Namibia, and I think he\u2019s tweaked his hamstring there. Bad news for the rest of the tournament. 65 min: Polledri fighting hard, with Parisse in support. Namibia nearly get the chance to steal a loose ball and run forward, but again it\u2019s knocked on in the tackle. 63 min: A scrum at halfway. A penalty for Italy, and they kick for touch via Canna well downfield. 61 min: A lot of hard tackling from Namibia around the halfway line, keeping possession through several phases before a sly box kick slides over the touch line just inside Italy\u2019s defensive 22. Namibia pressing now, though the scrum collapses and Italy retain possession. A high box kick doesn\u2019t gain much ground but does draw a knock from Namibia. Stevens feeds and clears. Loubser receives, dishes wide, and JC Greyling is over on the left! Between three defenders! Lovely run. Cliven Loubser from near the sideline hooks his right-footed kick just narrow of the goalpost. 56 min: Uanivi in the line-out drags down possession. Namibia trying to hold the ball through a few tackling phases. This is where they have fallen down all day, with the forwards not able to keep possession. A couple of subs now, two new front-rowers on with a scrum thanks to an Italian knock-on at the breakdown when the ball spilled loose. Retief and de Klerk on the field. 55 min: Loubser kicks the penalty for touch, not for goal. Namibia\u2019s line-out about 15 yards out. 54 min: Namibia with a big break, but lose possession in the tackle. An Italian kick comes back to Tromp, who kicks badly in return. But an Italian fumble in midfield is hoofed forward off the ground, and the Namibians pursue in numbers to lay a big tackle and win a penalty. Ferrari comes on for Quaglio. Italy with six or seven substitutes. Just the three for Namibia. The Italians don\u2019t roll away from the breakdown after van Jaarsveld is tackled, so he can\u2019t play the ball. About 30 yards out, Namibia take the kick and Loubser pops it over. Becoming a rout now, as Canna is on for a minute before receiving a pass, running through, and grounding enough of the ball as he\u2019s tackled near the line. The video ref calls it a try. Lots of changes for Italy. Allan, Bigi, Ruzza, plus the full-back Hayward. On come Fabiani, Budd, Canna and Minnozi. 45 min: Nearly streaming through again, Italy, but a handling error from Padovani slows the run. He manages not to knock on, but Namibia get back to defend. Italy with the line-out near their try line. They nearly burrow over through a couple of drives, but then Benvenuti sees a wide option all the way on the other side of the field, he grubs a flat lateral kick across field, and Padovani is there waiting to receive and run the try over. Despite the driving rain, the conversion follows. Kick off in the second half. Namibia\u2019s start, as the rain has started falling heavily during the break. Paressi kicks downfield, but the Italians steal the line-out from Namibia. Sloppy. Namibia would have felt like they were hanging in there a couple of minutes ago, but that try at the half really hurts. They\u2019ve had a few chances but haven\u2019t had the discipline to hold onto the ball through enough phases. Italy meanwhile have made a mess of quite a few chances themselves, and could be well clear. Namibia were thinking it was half-time already, the gong had gone but the final play was still going. And the Italians have taken advantage. From a scrum near the halfway line, the bearded Ruzza finds space near the sideline, gains some ground coming inboard, then fires off a look-away pass wide to Tebaldi cruising by! There\u2019s no one to intercept him and he runs over. Plus they convert from the wide angle. 40 min: Namibia on attack with the restart, just outside the 22. Uanivi away to Tromp, who passes to van Jaarsveld, as they drive towards the line. But eventually they\u2019re penalised again, late to the breakdown as they threatened the Italian try-line. Italy kick clear. A stretcher coming out for Tiziano Pasquiale. It looks like he might have done his collarbone, there\u2019s an ice-pack on there. Very unfortunate for the front-rower. The medical attendants get him in the air now. Perhaps that\u2019s also precautionary in case he has a neck injury. The clock has paused as Pasquiale is on the turf getting medical treatment. 38 min: Italy with possession at the half. Zanni at the bottom of a tackle. Allen receiving on the outside. Parisse makes some metres, but Padovani turns it over! Loubser puts in a brilliant long kick, Namibia follow up with a three-man tackling effort, and they\u2019ve driven Italy back into the defensive 22! Italy have to kick upfield. Tromp runs the ball back, and Namibia will keep it in hand now, looking to break the line, but eventually there\u2019s a knock-on. 36 min: Finally Italy break through! From the halfway! Break, break... and miss! An errant pass on the last link, and the ball goes out of play. Namibia play on immediately from the sideline, no fear. Just keep the ball in the first breakdown, then try to run through the centre. Eventually they\u2019re driven back though, and Loubser has to kick defensively for touch and breathing space. Namibia have kicked into a strong wind the whole game so far. Will be interesting to see if play changes in the second half. 34 min: Scrum, scrum, scrum. Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019re not missing anything. 31 min: A fumble receiving the pass from van Lill for Namibia, and they turn it over at about 30 yards out. Italy are almost as messy coming inboard, and the assistant ref rules there was a knock-on. Namibia will feed the scrum. The front rows bind, taking their time. Engage. Stevens cleans out, on to another tackle, from which van Lill tries to make amends by bullocking, but Italy steal possession from the breakdown. At the halfway. 28 min: A turnover in Namibia\u2019s back half. Benvenuti tries a grubber kick through the defence. It ends up with Loubser though, who clears with a defensive kick for touch. Italy\u2019s line-out. 27 min: The restart, and a line-out for Namibia. They hold possession. 25 min: Namibia kick to the halfway line, and now Italy will have to start again. Hayward doing a lot of lateral running. Opens up Morisi, who throws a dummy, gets the break, gets brought down near the line, manages the offload up, and Tommaso Allen is running by from the backline at just the right time. He crashes into the post, gets tackled, but manages to wrestle the ball down. The conversion is right in front, and over. 24 min: One tackle, then a box kick for touch, and Namibia get out of the try zone. Italy\u2019s line-out, and Parisse fumbles again, turning the ball over just outside Namibia\u2019s 22. 23 min: We\u2019ve been stuck in this Italian left corner for a long time, with yet another scrum. This time Stevens attacks Parisse as the Italian tries to run the ball from the back of the scrum again, and Stevens forces a knock-on. Now it\u2019s a Namibian feed for the scrum. 22 min: Scrum feed from Italy. The scrum turns, Parisse eventually drives over but the referee has already blown the whistle for a penalty. The scrum resets. Parisse tries again, this time grabbing the ball to run wide of the scrum, and he crashes into the referee! Nick Berry goes down, but he also prevents a try. That was the Italian player\u2019s fault, ran straight into him. Not the brightest move. They swap apologies and make up. 19 min: Namibia get out of their defensive area by forcing a penalty, but the ball comes back quickly through the run of Hayward. He\u2019s nearly over, but just brought down. Then there\u2019s a penalty against Namibia who infringed in the tackle. Scrum in the corner. 18 min: Morisi breaks the line, plays in Tommaso Allan, but he holds onto the ball too long when he has two options for a pass on the outside. He\u2019s tackled near the line and tries a one-handed flick away but it\u2019s too flat and low, and causes a knock-on just short of a try. 15 min: Stevens tries another run wide from a scrum on the centre line. He\u2019s tackled out wide and Italy force the turnover. Tibaldi kicks it away though, not sure why. Namibia kick it straight back, and out. Italy restart from their defensive area and kick up to the centre line, where there\u2019s a knock-on. A scrum, and Italy\u2019s feed. 12 min: Italy survive the early scare, and their defence is starting to settle now. 8 min: Italy push up into Namibia\u2019s 22 immediately! The box kick to clear doesn\u2019t work, and Italy take the line-out and push back up for the line. Morisi nearly wrestles the ball over. They pass wider for the next phase, and get awarded a penalty try for a defensive infringement right on the line. A missed line-out from Italy, and van Jaarsveld sharked the ball at the back of the line. He\u2019s away off-field, with a line of passes all the way to the far sideline, where it\u2019s nearly fumbled, but the pass via Chad Plato comes back inboard to Stevens who is on hand to run over on the right-hand side of the posts. There goes the conversion, over the crossbar. First score to the underdogs. 4 min: Van Lill drives it to the halfway line, but eventually the Italians give up trying to push their maul upfield, and go with a box kick. Italy return the favour, and manage to retain possession, but then kick long downfield to try to push Namibia back. 2 min: Venter is heavily involved in the contest right away, as a couple of scrums eventually go in Namibia\u2019s favour. Kick off! Italy\u2019s early error, and Namibia with the early penalty kick for touch. Rademeyer, van Jaarsveld, Coetzee, van Lill, Uanivi, Kitshoff, Conradie, Venter, Stevens, Loubser, Greyling, Harpe, Newman, Plato, Tromp. Quaglio, Bigi, Pasquali, Zanni, Ruzza, Steyn, Mbanda, Parisse, Tebaldi, Allan, Padovani, Morisi, Benvenuti, Bellini, Hayward. This should get you in the mood. Speakers up.

      "bodyText": "Rocky headlands frame the silvery white sands of Scolpaig Bay on the western coast of North Uist. The spread of machair \u2013 a grassland thick with flowers in summer \u2013 moorland and rock is much loved by walkers and birdwatchers. It is home to breeding colonies of cormorants and black guillemots as well as seals, otters and the occasional hen harrier. On the horizon to the west, the dramatic islands of St Kilda are just visible, otherwise there is nothing but the Atlantic. But a storm is brewing that is casting a deep cloud over the community, as fears grow about plans to build the UK\u2019s first spaceport in the middle of this stunning coastline, dividing the 1,200 people who live on the Hebridean island. Many fear that rockets blasting satellites into space from Spaceport 1 could shatter the calm of the island and terrify its rare wildlife. In consultation meetings last week in North Uist, locals raised their fears about the environmental impact as well as asking about the economic benefits. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds has now added its voice to the growing chorus of objections, warning that the chosen site is in a \u201chighly sensitive area\u201d. Scolpaig is part of a national scenic area, a designation that defines it as one of Scotland\u2019s 40 finest landscapes. It also sits adjacent to several special protection areas designated for their significance for birds. A major RSPB bird reserve, Balranald, is within 2km. Corncrakes, Greenland barnacle geese and ringed plover are just a few of the many species living in the area. More than 600 representations have been made to the Western Isles council (Comhairle nan Eilean Siar), the vast majority objecting to the plan to build what is described as the \u201cfirst phase\u201d of a spaceport to launch research rockets. Subsequent phases would involve further expansion to cater to the expanding global market for satellite launches. Locals fear that the industrial infrastructure and noise disturbance will damage the island\u2019s reputation as one of Europe\u2019s last great wildernesses. \u201cThis is a superbly beautiful area and tourism is a major source of income and jobs. It doesn\u2019t need this kind of industrial development,\u201d says Angus McNab, a resident and one of the founders of the protest group Friends of Scolpaig. Behind the spaceport application is a consortium that includes the council and the Highlands and Islands Enterprise agency (HIE), as well as the military contractor QinetiQ which already runs a missile firing range in nearby South Uist with radar tracking from its base on St Kilda. The council has invested \u00a31m in the scheme, buying the land in June, and the HIE has invested nearly \u00a310m. \u201cThe Uists have a fragile economy heavily dependent on the public sector. Here is a fantastic example of innovation which could bring real benefit to the community,\u201d says Joe McPhee, the council\u2019s head of economic development. The consortium promotes itself as offering \u201clow-cost access to space\u201d and is suggesting that the scheme could generate payments of about \u00a3900,000 a year for the islanders and up to 70 jobs. The island is desperate to secure its future after decades of slow but inexorable population decline as young people leave to find work on the mainland, and the population ages. The plan would also help boost Scotland\u2019s growing space industry, says McPhee. But McNab says: \u201cWe\u2019re sceptical of the promise of jobs for locals. At one meeting, it was admitted that there would be only eight to 13 jobs on the spaceport itself.\u201d He added that the most skilled jobs were unlikely to be filled by islanders. \u201cWe fear the militarisation of a precious landscape.\u201d There is a long history of the sparsely populated Western Isles being used for military installations, and the fear is that the beauty of Scolpaig may be yet another casualty.

The severity of the corruption laced through the electoral system was underlined earlier this month when the former chairs of both the country\u2019s election commission and its electoral complaints commission \u2013 responsible for running polls and managing complaints \u2013 were jailed for five years for graft, along with eight of their colleagues. And in a further blow to voter confidence, the US has pulled $160m (\u00a3128m) of aid for Afghanistan, citing government corruption and apparently linking the decision to elections. \u201cWe want free and fair elections,\u201d secretary of state Mike Pompeo said when asked about the funds. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do everything we can to support them, and we need every actor in the region, every leader, every citizen in Afghanistan to work towards that end.\u201d A new biometric system to verify voter identities is meant to cut down on ballot-stuffing and ghost voters, but civil society groups warned that the machines cannot prevent some forms of fraud such as duplicate voting, and election officials have not been given proper training in using them. Among the problems expected to cloud the elections are lack of clarity about how many polling stations are open, and the lack of clean and comprehensive voter lists. \u201cEven the Independent Electoral Commission does not know the exact number of polling centres that should be open on election day due to security. They should be approved by the security agencies, and the number given to the IEC has been questioned by the IEC,\u201d said AAN\u2019s Adili. \u201cIf some of these stations open in areas that are insecure and are not accessible to observers, then there could be ballot-stuffing.\u201d Many of these problems have been compounded by the fact that for months the elections were an uncertain prospect, on the political calendar under the constitution but thrust into a strange kind of political limbo by turbocharged US peace talks with the Taliban. Due to wrap up by September \u2013 an unofficial deadline set by Trump \u2013 they were widely expected to pave the way for an interim government, with elections cancelled or delayed. For some in Kabul that is exactly why it is vital people turn out for this vote, despite all its flaws. \u201cThis election is really important,\u201d said one Afghan civil society activist. \u201cBecause less than a month ago we were on the brink of having an emirate imposed on us.\u201d Additional reporting by Mokhtar Amiri",

The first time it is used to describe the skin colour of a gun-toting meth addict he encounters during a stint as a sex worker in Tucson. The second to describe the colour of the thigh-high boots worn by the hair stylist at a salon he lands at in Los Angeles in 2008. He is 19. Later, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/jane-fonda\" title=\"\">Jane Fonda</a>, a customer, tells Van Ness his hair makes him look like Jesus.</p> <p>Between these two smoky lavenders is a gulf that separates two versions of Van Ness: the garrulous, sassy, resident groomer of <em>Queer Eye</em> \u2013 and the emotionally bruised, risk-taking addict. As he warns readers midway through the book, \u201cBuckle up, buttercup, because I can go from comedy to tragedy in three seconds flat.\u201d</p> <p>Van Ness and I are in a Cadillac sedan, driving past the tangled, rusting architecture of Philadelphia\u2019s suburbs. Travelling like this is normal for him \u2013 on <em>Queer Eye</em>, he gets to roam the country waving his wand and transforming lives. The show, which was brought out of cold storage last year after an 11-year hiatus, has been a surprising success. America, it seems, is hungry for its uplifting brand of magic. A lot of that comes down to Van Ness, the show\u2019s foremost cheerleader for <em>Queer Eye\u2019s </em>stated mission of turning red (Republican) states pink, \u201cone makeover at a time\u201d. It\u2019s Van Ness who brings the energy to the party, <em>Yass queening</em><em> </em>his way through each episode, scattering memes and neologisms wherever he goes, and generally helping people connect to their feelings, often by tapping into his own. Tears are never far below the surface. Resistance is futile. Everyone loves him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fac4a123031cc96e760689928d17e36536f47f65\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fac4a123031cc96e760689928d17e36536f47f65/54_0_3493_2097/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Looking sharp: the Fab Five from the first series of Queer Eye.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Looking sharp: the Fab Five from the first series of Queer Eye.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gavin Bond/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Van Ness has a hectic, energetic style and a voice that soars high and then higher. In the car he talks quickly, words tumbling out of his mouth in a way that can leave you trailing far behind. When I ask if any of his encounters on <em>Queer Eye </em>have changed him, he answers: \u201cThe act of showing up for your family and being able to live in the world I think is heroic. There\u2019s like 15 bajillion eggs in the ovaries and who even knows how many, like, little spermies are in there, so the fact we got to be born and be living this long is kind of like a mathematical who-knew.\u201d This is, I <em>think</em>, a roundabout way of saying we all deserve to be acknowledged. But things are way more fun when Van Ness says them.</p> <p>For our meeting, I\u2019d taken the train from New York to Philadelphia, where Van Ness was filming an episode of the show, with vague plans to walk to the Liberty Bell. But he\u2019d just received a 24-hour reprieve from work and, shortly before arriving, his publicist suggested I drive back to New York with him. Sitting in the back of a car with someone you\u2019ve never met can be awkward, and I was conflicted. But Van Ness disarms with charm. A pop culture magpie, he slides from subject to subject and dares you to keep up. How he finds time to watch so much, know so much, work so much, is a conundrum.

We talk about cats \u2013 he has four, including Liza Meownelli \u2013 and we watch an old video that surfaced late last year on the <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA7TkKJApg8\" title=\"\">Jimmy Kimmel Show</a></em>. In it the 11-year old Van Ness performs an interpretative dance to Jewel\u2019s Pieces of You \u2013 his entry in the school talent show. For the number, he wore a kabuki mask positioned on the back of his head and a baggy black T-shirt emblazoned with a question mark. The piece, inspired by an ice-skating routine, culminates in a triple-axel-style pirouette that is so wholehearted, so gutsy and so precious that it\u2019s heartbreaking. At the time, his mother gently suggested he might want to reconsider. The other kids, she said, might not let him live it down. But when had they ever?</p> <p>What Van Ness knew early on was that the world of women was more interesting to him than the world of men. He recalls at the age of four telling his father\u2019s friend that he wanted to be a cabana girl or a cosmetologist when he grew up. As an adult, he would gravitate to the term \u201cgender queer\u201d to express his place in the world, but that wasn\u2019t an option in childhood. A particularly painful story conjures his father\u2019s war on his gender exploration. \u201cI remember very clearly my dad finding me in an evening gown with my two cousins,\u201d he says. \u201cHe tore me out of the dress, holding me in the air so that I was perpendicular to the ground. I was terrified.\u201d</p> <p>But there were pockets of joy, too. Joining the junior varsity cheerleading squad at high school at 14 was an epiphany \u2013 he felt at home immediately. When I make the faux pas of forgetting who starred in <em>Bring It On</em>, the cult 1999 cheerleading movie, Van Ness gasps. \u201cI could almost throw you out of the back of this car for asking such a preposterous question,\u201d he says. \u201cSo, you\u2019re telling me you came to this interview not having seen <em>Bring It On</em>? What were you doing?\u201d</p> <p>In season four of <em>Queer Eye</em>, viewers saw Van Ness return to his high school in Quincy to makeover his arts teacher, Cathy Dooley, a beloved figure who stood out for not making him feel different or unusual. The cameras show Van Ness performing with the cheerleading squad as students clap and whoop. It\u2019s a moving spectacle that implies a circle has been closed. Everyone loves queer people now, even in Quincy.</p> <p>But what we see on screen is not the whole truth. A few weeks before the Fab Five arrived, the school had asked parents to sign permission slips for their children to be on camera, prompting protests from a local pastor. \u201cHe sent a letter to the newspaper that blasted the normalisation of LGBTQ culture, and said we should not be rolling out the welcome mats at a public school,\u201d Van Ness says. \u201cIt was just a really nasty letter.\u201d Nor was it just any old pastor. \u201cThis was someone who was like a family friend, someone I\u2019d known for a very long time.\u201d He looks glum. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve come as far as I wished and hoped that we had.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e97681245edad23f0c1c26a75abb820a54fc0356\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e97681245edad23f0c1c26a75abb820a54fc0356/0_0_6000_3599/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Smile please: posing for a selfie with a fan at 2019 MTV Video Music Awards in New Jersey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Smile please: posing for a selfie with a fan at 2019 MTV Video Music Awards in New Jersey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Leaving small town America in order to be fully himself, only to find being fully himself is what brings him back to small town America, is an irony not lost on Van Ness. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit <em>Gift of the Ma</em><em>gi</em>,\u201d he says. But he also knows Quincy is his secret weapon because \u201ceven the most Republican-ass Trump supporter is someone I have grown up next door to\u201d. Or even grown up <em>with</em>. Three years ago, he had to work hard to convince his father not to vote for Trump. \u201cI cussed my dad out 300 of the days of 2016,\u201d he says. \u201cOur relationship literally was on thin ice over that election.\u201d In the end, Van Ness Senior voted for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/gary-johnson\" title=\"\">Gary Johnson</a>, the nominee for the Libertarian party. \u201cI was really proud of him for it,\u201d he says.</p> <p>When the original<em><strong> </strong>Queer Eye </em>premiered on the Bravo channel in 2003, it was a more straightforward makeover show inspired by advice columns in <em>Esquire</em> magazine. Where it was radical was in the casting of five confident, unapologetic gay men to dish advice to hapless straight men. But people rarely cried and there was little talk of self-care. \u201cI was just trying to get guys out of pleated khakis and to get them to cut off their mullets,\u201d says Carson Kressley, who starred in the original. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us thought the show had any sort of idea about making a political statement.\u201d The 2018 reboot, on Netflix, repackaged the Fab Five as social missionaries spreading the gospel of love around America. A masterstroke was to take the guys out of New York, where the original show had been located, and into the heartland states that voted for Donald Trump in 2016. In a fractured society, the show would open minds by showing that our similarities were greater than our differences. Or, as another of the Fab Five, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jul/07/queer-eye-karamo-brown-what-are-we-doing-teaching-boys-they-cant-express-feelings\" title=\"\">Karamo Brown</a>, said in the opening episode of season one: \u201cWe\u2019ve all got to come together in a way we can understand each other.\u201d</p> <p>There have been four seasons of <em>Queer Eye </em>since its debut in February 2018 and a new one will drop early next year. The show\u2019s hosts have not wasted time, assiduously attending to their brand while they still enjoy the spotlight. Three have published books this year and this month it\u2019s the turn of Van Ness. His memoir, <em>Over the Top, </em>could have been a ghostwriter\u2019s gift, packed with his witticisms and mantras for self-care. Instead it\u2019s a lightning bolt \u2013 devastating and stirring, powered by years of anguish and humiliation. Does he worry how fans will react to his own revelations? \u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d he admits. \u201cBut I\u2019m ready to pull the Band Aid off.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8b3cf84098d0403ab04c4cb7dbd7f451b3cfdf1a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b3cf84098d0403ab04c4cb7dbd7f451b3cfdf1a/0_303_2633_3480/757.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve come as far as I wished and hoped that we had\u2019: Jonathan Van Ness.\" width=\"757\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve come as far as I wished and hoped that we had\u2019: Jonathan Van Ness.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danielle Levitt/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Van Ness, <em>Over the Top </em>is about charting his own path through adolescence towards the triumph that is <em>Queer Eye</em>, but it\u2019s also about owning \u2013 and thereby defusing \u2013 two of the most traumatic chapters in his life. The first occurred when he was four, when an older boy molested him in a closet. Van Ness tells his parents but it\u2019s written off as \u201cexperimentation\u201d and swiftly passed over. That single act of abuse casts a long, pernicious shadow over the book as we witness the ways in which Van Ness acts out his confusion and pain, from taking crystal meth, to sustained binges in sex clubs that satisfy his need to be wanted. He joins a 12-step programme for sex addiction, but relapses.</p> <p>In the midst of all that, his stepfather, Steve, is diagnosed with bladder cancer, and told he has 11 months to live. His death, when it comes, knocks Van Ness back into the unhealthy behaviour he\u2019s been working to quit.</p> <p>\u201cEverything that happened to me that summer will always be painful to think about,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was like saying goodbye to so much of what I wanted.\u201d</p> <p>Shortly after the funeral, his former boyfriend tracked him down at a bathhouse in St Louis and Van Ness\u2019s fall to rock bottom seems complete. Almost. When he gets sick, collapsing at the hair salon he is working at one afternoon, he already knows what a doctor will tell him a day later: he is HIV positive.</p> <p>Van Ness writes about these bombshells with a quiet tenacity that skirts melodrama. He wonders if his reckless behaviour was a self-fulfilling prophecy, the consequence of all the fear ingrained in him at such a young age. He wants other people not to have to go through the same thing.</p> <p>\u201cIt occurred to me: what if everything I\u2019ve ever been through was preparing me for this moment \u2013 to be strong enough to share this, and to share it on my own terms,\u201d he says. \u201cPart of that for me is to process what\u2019s happened, but the bigger part is that I wanted to do something to move the conversation forward in a meaningful way around HIV/Aids, and what it is to live with HIV, and to humanise and normalise a lot of the things I talk about.\u201d He blinks, then adds, \u201cI\u2019m talking slow because I\u2019m trying not to cry.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ec1c2e581105836095ea196d42bb62279b96d61\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ec1c2e581105836095ea196d42bb62279b96d61/0_1899_6324_6139/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I wanted to do something to move the conversation forward in a meaningful way\u2019: Jonathan Van Ness on his HIV activism.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"971\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I wanted to do something to move the conversation forward in a meaningful way\u2019: Jonathan Van Ness on his HIV activism.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danielle Levitt/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em><strong>We are nearing </strong></em>New York, and the canyons of Manhattan fill the hazy skyline. Growing up, Van Ness used to fantasise he would help other people like himself. \u201cI always felt that was part of my purpose,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I thought it would be a really chic juice studio with great baked goods, maybe a dance and yoga studio.\u201d He didn\u2019t think the way he\u2019d help people was simply by being himself on a global TV show \u2013 or by penning a generous and frank memoir.</p> <p>At a certain point, Van Ness picked himself up and decided he didn\u2019t want to throw away his life. \u201cIt really took some time to figure out how to put my life together,\u201d he says. But medical advances mean the virus is now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/29/hiv-positive-drugs-nobody-catch-virus\" title=\"\">undetectable</a> in his blood. He remembers the day he was given his HIV diagnosis, asking the doctor if he could still live to be 75. \u201cShe was, like, \u2018I will keep you alive long enough to die of a heart attack or cancer like everyone else,\u2019 and then she laughed uncontrollably.\u201d</p> <p>Is he making time for relationships? Van Ness shakes his head. \u201cIn the past, I\u2019ve had relationships with people who I was almost using to validate myself and my existence, and that\u2019s not been a great plan for me,\u201d he says. \u201cSo, this is a season of me falling in love with myself all the way.\u201d</p> <p>In some ways, he thinks that testing positive for HIV has been his liberation. In the past year, he has taken up ice-skating and thrown himself into gymnastics. And, of course, there is an election to fight. \u201cI absolutely do not think I\u2019d have been as socially aware or conscious or want to make as much of a difference,\u201d he says. \u201cIt gave me a reason to really fight.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a191a2e565ba8a49c799dcd04f905e60d5d9a699\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a191a2e565ba8a49c799dcd04f905e60d5d9a699/0_960_6307_7851/803.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I want to humanise a lot of the difficult things  I talk about\u2019: Jonathan Van Ness.\" width=\"803\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I want to humanise a lot of the difficult things I talk about\u2019: Jonathan Van Ness.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danielle Levitt/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>You know those plants that are always trying to find the light? <br>Extract from Over the Top by Jonathan Van Ness</h2> <p>Picture me in the seventh grade: a chubby, slightly snaggletoothed kid with a voluminous mop of frizzy curly hair. I\u2019d be cycling through several of my cutest looks, usually monochromatic jumpers with severe Doc Martens boots, just to go to the mall. It felt entirely possible that a talent scout would be there, in the nation\u2019s smallest capital of Springfield, Illinois I\u2019d practice ice-skating routines in my living room, trying to be like the Olympians I idolised, imagining how triumphant I\u2019d be when I finally seized that gold medal. The years of fantasising about reaching stratospheric fame through a local mall discovery had long since faded by 2017. I\u2019d settled for much more attainable goals. I became a hairdresser, working in both LA and New York. I\u2019d stumbled, very gratefully, into a side hustle in the form of a web series called Gay of Thrones. That spring I would move to Atlanta to shoot a dream project with four new friends. We had beaten out the collective gay world for these five coveted positions, and we all knew it was a monumental opportunity. Like Maya Angelou taught me, I was hoping for the best, but preparing for the worst, so that nothing could catch me off guard. I was just happy that I had completed my mission of escaping cornfield-small-town-only-gay-person infamy and was now free to live an authentic queer life in a gorgeous big city with a Trader Joe\u2019s and nobody thinking twice about my leggings.</p> <p>A year later in February, Queer Eye had just come out, and I was on my way to a meeting. To my shock I arrived early, so I went to grab a coffee, and as I was walking in, this lady with the most gorgeous expertly done microbraids and giant glasses stopped me and bellowed, \u201cHoney, this faggotry you are serving is giving me everything!\u201d</p> <p>At first, I was confused. Did she just call me a fag? But the smile on her face and her extreme proximity seemed to suggest a loving and enamoured person. I\u2019m now doubly confused, I\u2019m running ahead of schedule, and strangers are stopping me. Mind you, it\u2019s still 8.15am, my eyes still subtly perma-stoned from last night\u2019s edible, and I hadn\u2019t even had my coffee yet! So I said, \u201cThanks, queen,\u201d and continued on my way.</p> <p>But then two steps later, two other girls stopped me. They said they were living for the show and asked if they could take selfies. Of course I said, \u201cYes, sweets!\u201d and that caused a few more girls from outside the shop to come in for what was quickly becoming an impromptu meet-and-greet. My original encounter from the store got in line for her pic next, then became the photographer for the rest of the meet-and-greet. After thanking all my new friends, I left the coffee shop to head back with no coffee because I forgot. Well, that was fun. How much am I thriving right now? I thought.</p> <p>Crossing the street to go to my meeting, a very nice man stopped me and began playing twenty questions with me about my life, about the show, about everything. I obliged, because I\u2019m eternally a people pleaser, and I didn\u2019t want him to feel bad, but at that point my early arrival turned into being fully actually late to the meeting. When I was filming Queer Eye in secrecy with the boys in Atlanta in 2017, sometimes producers, or people who were familiar with the show\u2019s revival, would ask me, \u201cAre you ready for your life to change?\u201d I always said, \u201cOMG, yes! But this morning, something shifted. People knew who I was, everywhere I went.</p> <p>There was a girl who stopped me on the corner of Twenty-Third and Park not long after the show came out. We made eye contact for a split second and it was like an invisible Jackie Chan punched her in the stomach. She doubled over. She took a dramatic step back. \u201cOh my God,\u201d she yelled. \u201cOh my God! Oh my God!\u201d I was so worried about her that I stopped right there and pulled her onto the curb. We sat for a while until she pulled herself together.</p> <p>When people had asked me whether I was ready for my life to change, I don\u2019t think I really understood what they meant. It wasn\u2019t just that strangers would know who I was. It was this other thing that started to happen to me: when I looked in their eyes, sometimes, there was a little voice in my head wondering, Would you still be so excited to meet me if you really knew who I was? If you knew all the things I\u2019d done? If you could see all my parts?</p> <p>Sure, there\u2019s a part of me that\u2019s endlessly positive. But it\u2019s just one part. It\u2019s a beautiful part, a strong part, and an important part, but it\u2019s not all of it. There are other parts I want to show, parts that are a little bit scarier to get into. Like the nagging, insecure part of me that worries my positivity is faker than the hair that covers the chalkboard scalp of Donald Trump. Or the part of me that\u2019s had sex with a ton of people \u2013 a lot of whom I wish I hadn\u2019t. What about my irritated part, which isn\u2019t the easiest to deal with if my people-pleasing part has been working overtime. My binge-eating part, my part that just wants to be left alone, or my part that could make you pray for me to catch permanent laryngitis because I can\u2019t stop telling you about the Romanovs, or my cats, or the irony of the GOP that wants low taxes and even lower federal government regulation, unless it comes to regulation of people\u2019s pregnancies, marijuana, or the fundamentally racist state and federal prison systems. Because when you have this much personality, there\u2019s a fear lurking just below the surface: If you knew all of me, you wouldn\u2019t love me anymore. You would no longer want me as your new best friend.</p> <p><em>Over the Top by Jonathan Van Ness is published by Simon &amp; Schuster at \u00a320.

      "bodyText": "The words \u201csmoky lavender\u201d appear twice in Over the Top, a memoir by Jonathan Van Ness, the most fabulous of the so-called Fab Five on Queer Eye, the hyperventilating makeover show in which he stars. The first time it is used to describe the skin colour of a gun-toting meth addict he encounters during a stint as a sex worker in Tucson. The second to describe the colour of the thigh-high boots worn by the hair stylist at a salon he lands at in Los Angeles in 2008. He is 19. Later, Jane Fonda, a customer, tells Van Ness his hair makes him look like Jesus. Between these two smoky lavenders is a gulf that separates two versions of Van Ness: the garrulous, sassy, resident groomer of Queer Eye \u2013 and the emotionally bruised, risk-taking addict. As he warns readers midway through the book, \u201cBuckle up, buttercup, because I can go from comedy to tragedy in three seconds flat.\u201d Van Ness and I are in a Cadillac sedan, driving past the tangled, rusting architecture of Philadelphia\u2019s suburbs. Travelling like this is normal for him \u2013 on Queer Eye, he gets to roam the country waving his wand and transforming lives. The show, which was brought out of cold storage last year after an 11-year hiatus, has been a surprising success. America, it seems, is hungry for its uplifting brand of magic. A lot of that comes down to Van Ness, the show\u2019s foremost cheerleader for Queer Eye\u2019s stated mission of turning red (Republican) states pink, \u201cone makeover at a time\u201d. It\u2019s Van Ness who brings the energy to the party, Yass queening his way through each episode, scattering memes and neologisms wherever he goes, and generally helping people connect to their feelings, often by tapping into his own. Tears are never far below the surface. Resistance is futile. Everyone loves him. Van Ness has a hectic, energetic style and a voice that soars high and then higher. In the car he talks quickly, words tumbling out of his mouth in a way that can leave you trailing far behind. When I ask if any of his encounters on Queer Eye have changed him, he answers: \u201cThe act of showing up for your family and being able to live in the world I think is heroic. There\u2019s like 15 bajillion eggs in the ovaries and who even knows how many, like, little spermies are in there, so the fact we got to be born and be living this long is kind of like a mathematical who-knew.\u201d This is, I think, a roundabout way of saying we all deserve to be acknowledged. But things are way more fun when Van Ness says them. For our meeting, I\u2019d taken the train from New York to Philadelphia, where Van Ness was filming an episode of the show, with vague plans to walk to the Liberty Bell. But he\u2019d just received a 24-hour reprieve from work and, shortly before arriving, his publicist suggested I drive back to New York with him. Sitting in the back of a car with someone you\u2019ve never met can be awkward, and I was conflicted. But Van Ness disarms with charm. A pop culture magpie, he slides from subject to subject and dares you to keep up. How he finds time to watch so much, know so much, work so much, is a conundrum. Lately, he has learned to meditate as a way to manage his stress. \u201cOn Sundays I sometimes don\u2019t work,\u201d he says. We are on Route 95 somewhere outside of Philadelphia and, as we navigate the traffic, we admire his latest manicure, each nail painted to represent a different cast member of the 1996 comedy the First Wives Club, a touchstone for Van Ness. \u201cThis is Goldie Hawn getting her lips done,\u201d he says, lifting a finger for inspection. We talk about cats \u2013 he has four, including Liza Meownelli \u2013 and we watch an old video that surfaced late last year on the Jimmy Kimmel Show. In it the 11-year old Van Ness performs an interpretative dance to Jewel\u2019s Pieces of You \u2013 his entry in the school talent show. For the number, he wore a kabuki mask positioned on the back of his head and a baggy black T-shirt emblazoned with a question mark. The piece, inspired by an ice-skating routine, culminates in a triple-axel-style pirouette that is so wholehearted, so gutsy and so precious that it\u2019s heartbreaking. At the time, his mother gently suggested he might want to reconsider. The other kids, she said, might not let him live it down. But when had they ever? What Van Ness knew early on was that the world of women was more interesting to him than the world of men. He recalls at the age of four telling his father\u2019s friend that he wanted to be a cabana girl or a cosmetologist when he grew up. As an adult, he would gravitate to the term \u201cgender queer\u201d to express his place in the world, but that wasn\u2019t an option in childhood. A particularly painful story conjures his father\u2019s war on his gender exploration. \u201cI remember very clearly my dad finding me in an evening gown with my two cousins,\u201d he says. \u201cHe tore me out of the dress, holding me in the air so that I was perpendicular to the ground. I was terrified.\u201d But there were pockets of joy, too. Joining the junior varsity cheerleading squad at high school at 14 was an epiphany \u2013 he felt at home immediately. When I make the faux pas of forgetting who starred in Bring It On, the cult 1999 cheerleading movie, Van Ness gasps. \u201cI could almost throw you out of the back of this car for asking such a preposterous question,\u201d he says. \u201cSo, you\u2019re telling me you came to this interview not having seen Bring It On? What were you doing?\u201d In season four of Queer Eye, viewers saw Van Ness return to his high school in Quincy to makeover his arts teacher, Cathy Dooley, a beloved figure who stood out for not making him feel different or unusual. The cameras show Van Ness performing with the cheerleading squad as students clap and whoop. It\u2019s a moving spectacle that implies a circle has been closed. Everyone loves queer people now, even in Quincy. But what we see on screen is not the whole truth. A few weeks before the Fab Five arrived, the school had asked parents to sign permission slips for their children to be on camera, prompting protests from a local pastor. \u201cHe sent a letter to the newspaper that blasted the normalisation of LGBTQ culture, and said we should not be rolling out the welcome mats at a public school,\u201d Van Ness says. \u201cIt was just a really nasty letter.\u201d Nor was it just any old pastor. \u201cThis was someone who was like a family friend, someone I\u2019d known for a very long time.\u201d He looks glum. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve come as far as I wished and hoped that we had.\u201d Leaving small town America in order to be fully himself, only to find being fully himself is what brings him back to small town America, is an irony not lost on Van Ness. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit Gift of the Magi,\u201d he says. But he also knows Quincy is his secret weapon because \u201ceven the most Republican-ass Trump supporter is someone I have grown up next door to\u201d. Or even grown up with. Three years ago, he had to work hard to convince his father not to vote for Trump. \u201cI cussed my dad out 300 of the days of 2016,\u201d he says. \u201cOur relationship literally was on thin ice over that election.\u201d In the end, Van Ness Senior voted for Gary Johnson, the nominee for the Libertarian party. \u201cI was really proud of him for it,\u201d he says. When the original Queer Eye premiered on the Bravo channel in 2003, it was a more straightforward makeover show inspired by advice columns in Esquire magazine. Where it was radical was in the casting of five confident, unapologetic gay men to dish advice to hapless straight men. But people rarely cried and there was little talk of self-care. \u201cI was just trying to get guys out of pleated khakis and to get them to cut off their mullets,\u201d says Carson Kressley, who starred in the original. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us thought the show had any sort of idea about making a political statement.\u201d The 2018 reboot, on Netflix, repackaged the Fab Five as social missionaries spreading the gospel of love around America. A masterstroke was to take the guys out of New York, where the original show had been located, and into the heartland states that voted for Donald Trump in 2016. In a fractured society, the show would open minds by showing that our similarities were greater than our differences. Or, as another of the Fab Five, Karamo Brown, said in the opening episode of season one: \u201cWe\u2019ve all got to come together in a way we can understand each other.\u201d There have been four seasons of Queer Eye since its debut in February 2018 and a new one will drop early next year. The show\u2019s hosts have not wasted time, assiduously attending to their brand while they still enjoy the spotlight. Three have published books this year and this month it\u2019s the turn of Van Ness. His memoir, Over the Top, could have been a ghostwriter\u2019s gift, packed with his witticisms and mantras for self-care. Instead it\u2019s a lightning bolt \u2013 devastating and stirring, powered by years of anguish and humiliation. Does he worry how fans will react to his own revelations? \u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d he admits. \u201cBut I\u2019m ready to pull the Band Aid off.\u201d For Van Ness, Over the Top is about charting his own path through adolescence towards the triumph that is Queer Eye, but it\u2019s also about owning \u2013 and thereby defusing \u2013 two of the most traumatic chapters in his life. The first occurred when he was four, when an older boy molested him in a closet. Van Ness tells his parents but it\u2019s written off as \u201cexperimentation\u201d and swiftly passed over. That single act of abuse casts a long, pernicious shadow over the book as we witness the ways in which Van Ness acts out his confusion and pain, from taking crystal meth, to sustained binges in sex clubs that satisfy his need to be wanted. He joins a 12-step programme for sex addiction, but relapses. In the midst of all that, his stepfather, Steve, is diagnosed with bladder cancer, and told he has 11 months to live. His death, when it comes, knocks Van Ness back into the unhealthy behaviour he\u2019s been working to quit. \u201cEverything that happened to me that summer will always be painful to think about,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was like saying goodbye to so much of what I wanted.\u201d Shortly after the funeral, his former boyfriend tracked him down at a bathhouse in St Louis and Van Ness\u2019s fall to rock bottom seems complete. Almost. When he gets sick, collapsing at the hair salon he is working at one afternoon, he already knows what a doctor will tell him a day later: he is HIV positive. Van Ness writes about these bombshells with a quiet tenacity that skirts melodrama. He wonders if his reckless behaviour was a self-fulfilling prophecy, the consequence of all the fear ingrained in him at such a young age. He wants other people not to have to go through the same thing. \u201cIt occurred to me: what if everything I\u2019ve ever been through was preparing me for this moment \u2013 to be strong enough to share this, and to share it on my own terms,\u201d he says. \u201cPart of that for me is to process what\u2019s happened, but the bigger part is that I wanted to do something to move the conversation forward in a meaningful way around HIV/Aids, and what it is to live with HIV, and to humanise and normalise a lot of the things I talk about.\u201d He blinks, then adds, \u201cI\u2019m talking slow because I\u2019m trying not to cry.\u201d We are nearing New York, and the canyons of Manhattan fill the hazy skyline. Growing up, Van Ness used to fantasise he would help other people like himself. \u201cI always felt that was part of my purpose,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I thought it would be a really chic juice studio with great baked goods, maybe a dance and yoga studio.\u201d He didn\u2019t think the way he\u2019d help people was simply by being himself on a global TV show \u2013 or by penning a generous and frank memoir. At a certain point, Van Ness picked himself up and decided he didn\u2019t want to throw away his life. \u201cIt really took some time to figure out how to put my life together,\u201d he says. But medical advances mean the virus is now undetectable in his blood. He remembers the day he was given his HIV diagnosis, asking the doctor if he could still live to be 75. \u201cShe was, like, \u2018I will keep you alive long enough to die of a heart attack or cancer like everyone else,\u2019 and then she laughed uncontrollably.\u201d Is he making time for relationships? Van Ness shakes his head. \u201cIn the past, I\u2019ve had relationships with people who I was almost using to validate myself and my existence, and that\u2019s not been a great plan for me,\u201d he says. \u201cSo, this is a season of me falling in love with myself all the way.\u201d In some ways, he thinks that testing positive for HIV has been his liberation. In the past year, he has taken up ice-skating and thrown himself into gymnastics. And, of course, there is an election to fight. \u201cI absolutely do not think I\u2019d have been as socially aware or conscious or want to make as much of a difference,\u201d he says. \u201cIt gave me a reason to really fight.\u201d You know those plants that are always trying to find the light? Extract from Over the Top by Jonathan Van Ness Picture me in the seventh grade: a chubby, slightly snaggletoothed kid with a voluminous mop of frizzy curly hair. I\u2019d be cycling through several of my cutest looks, usually monochromatic jumpers with severe Doc Martens boots, just to go to the mall. It felt entirely possible that a talent scout would be there, in the nation\u2019s smallest capital of Springfield, Illinois I\u2019d practice ice-skating routines in my living room, trying to be like the Olympians I idolised, imagining how triumphant I\u2019d be when I finally seized that gold medal. The years of fantasising about reaching stratospheric fame through a local mall discovery had long since faded by 2017. I\u2019d settled for much more attainable goals. I became a hairdresser, working in both LA and New York. I\u2019d stumbled, very gratefully, into a side hustle in the form of a web series called Gay of Thrones. That spring I would move to Atlanta to shoot a dream project with four new friends. We had beaten out the collective gay world for these five coveted positions, and we all knew it was a monumental opportunity. Like Maya Angelou taught me, I was hoping for the best, but preparing for the worst, so that nothing could catch me off guard. I was just happy that I had completed my mission of escaping cornfield-small-town-only-gay-person infamy and was now free to live an authentic queer life in a gorgeous big city with a Trader Joe\u2019s and nobody thinking twice about my leggings. A year later in February, Queer Eye had just come out, and I was on my way to a meeting. To my shock I arrived early, so I went to grab a coffee, and as I was walking in, this lady with the most gorgeous expertly done microbraids and giant glasses stopped me and bellowed, \u201cHoney, this faggotry you are serving is giving me everything!\u201d At first, I was confused. Did she just call me a fag? But the smile on her face and her extreme proximity seemed to suggest a loving and enamoured person. I\u2019m now doubly confused, I\u2019m running ahead of schedule, and strangers are stopping me. Mind you, it\u2019s still 8.15am, my eyes still subtly perma-stoned from last night\u2019s edible, and I hadn\u2019t even had my coffee yet! So I said, \u201cThanks, queen,\u201d and continued on my way. But then two steps later, two other girls stopped me. They said they were living for the show and asked if they could take selfies. Of course I said, \u201cYes, sweets!\u201d and that caused a few more girls from outside the shop to come in for what was quickly becoming an impromptu meet-and-greet. My original encounter from the store got in line for her pic next, then became the photographer for the rest of the meet-and-greet. After thanking all my new friends, I left the coffee shop to head back with no coffee because I forgot. Well, that was fun. How much am I thriving right now? I thought. Crossing the street to go to my meeting, a very nice man stopped me and began playing twenty questions with me about my life, about the show, about everything. I obliged, because I\u2019m eternally a people pleaser, and I didn\u2019t want him to feel bad, but at that point my early arrival turned into being fully actually late to the meeting. When I was filming Queer Eye in secrecy with the boys in Atlanta in 2017, sometimes producers, or people who were familiar with the show\u2019s revival, would ask me, \u201cAre you ready for your life to change?\u201d I always said, \u201cOMG, yes! But this morning, something shifted. People knew who I was, everywhere I went. There was a girl who stopped me on the corner of Twenty-Third and Park not long after the show came out. We made eye contact for a split second and it was like an invisible Jackie Chan punched her in the stomach. She doubled over. She took a dramatic step back. \u201cOh my God,\u201d she yelled. \u201cOh my God! Oh my God!\u201d I was so worried about her that I stopped right there and pulled her onto the curb. We sat for a while until she pulled herself together. When people had asked me whether I was ready for my life to change, I don\u2019t think I really understood what they meant. It wasn\u2019t just that strangers would know who I was. It was this other thing that started to happen to me: when I looked in their eyes, sometimes, there was a little voice in my head wondering, Would you still be so excited to meet me if you really knew who I was? If you knew all the things I\u2019d done? If you could see all my parts? Sure, there\u2019s a part of me that\u2019s endlessly positive. But it\u2019s just one part. It\u2019s a beautiful part, a strong part, and an important part, but it\u2019s not all of it. There are other parts I want to show, parts that are a little bit scarier to get into. Like the nagging, insecure part of me that worries my positivity is faker than the hair that covers the chalkboard scalp of Donald Trump. Or the part of me that\u2019s had sex with a ton of people \u2013 a lot of whom I wish I hadn\u2019t. What about my irritated part, which isn\u2019t the easiest to deal with if my people-pleasing part has been working overtime. My binge-eating part, my part that just wants to be left alone, or my part that could make you pray for me to catch permanent laryngitis because I can\u2019t stop telling you about the Romanovs, or my cats, or the irony of the GOP that wants low taxes and even lower federal government regulation, unless it comes to regulation of people\u2019s pregnancies, marijuana, or the fundamentally racist state and federal prison systems. Because when you have this much personality, there\u2019s a fear lurking just below the surface: If you knew all of me, you wouldn\u2019t love me anymore. You would no longer want me as your new best friend. Over the Top by Jonathan Van Ness is published by Simon &amp; Schuster at \u00a320.

      "bodyText": "\u2018At first I wanted to photograph issues, but I came to realise that this is a story about trauma \u2013 the ripple effect of trauma, how trauma is passed on from generation to generation.\u201d That is how the Scottish photographer Kirsty Mackay describes her project The Fish That Never Swam, a quietly powerful study of low life expectancy in Glasgow through a series of compelling portraits. Mackay began shooting the series in 2016, after the Glasgow Centre for Population Health published research into Scotland\u2019s so-called \u201cexcess mortality\u201d \u2013 5,000 more people die in Scotland per year than the UK average. Glasgow is at the centre of that spike: at 73.3 years, male life expectancy in the city is the lowest in western Europe, which has given rise to the term \u201cthe Glasgow effect\u201d. Going beyond the poverty and deprivation that are the main causes of poor health in any society, the report flags up other contributing factors, in particular Glasgow\u2019s controversial housing policy in the 1970s. Ellen, 51, moved to Easterhouse in 1973, aged five. As a young woman she worked in the bingo hall in the Red Road flats. She has three children and four grandchildren. That policy \u2013 of breaking up working-class neighbourhoods and rehousing their inhabitants in estates on the edges of town \u2013 cut people adrift from their community support networks and left them particularly vulnerable to the mass unemployment of the 80s. \u201cThere was so much disruption in housing, working-class communities lost their roots,\u201d says Mackay, who herself grew up in Glasgow. \u201cPeople had to start all over again.\u201d Mackay\u2019s project focuses on individuals whose life and experiences \u201ctell part of the city\u2019s story\u201d, including those from the \u201cbig four\u201d estates \u2013 Pollok, Drumchapel, Castlemilk and Easterhouse. There\u2019s Billy McMillan, for example, an articulate young man from Easterhouse whose teachers ruled out further education. There\u2019s Wee John, pictured on the border between Drumchapel and Bearsden, where male life expectancy varies massively depending on which side of the divide you\u2019re on. Wee John, pictured on the border between the Drumchapel and Bearsden, where male life expectancy varies massively depending on which side of the divide you come from. Then there\u2019s Liz, a young woman who lost her partner to suicide in 2015, a not uncommon experience. Suicide rates are higher in Glasgow than in any other Scottish city, and are considerably higher in Scotland than in England. \u201cSuicide came up again and again,\u201d says Mackay. \u201cI couldn\u2019t ignore it. What I wanted to do was photograph the people who have been left behind \u2013 not just the deaths but the impact they have.\u201d She adds that the subject resonates on a personal level: Mackay witnessed two suicides when she was growing up, one on her way home from school. \u201cPeople taking their own lives, and some of the other things I saw \u2013 that has had an effect,\u201d she says. \u201cThese are things I had put away, but doing the project has brought them back up again.\u201d Kirsty Mackay pictured with her parents in Maryhill, 1971. \u2018This was the first flat I lived in.

Partick was a mixed area next to the more prosperous Hillhead district, and Mackay says that growing up seeing those differences made a difference. \u201cThere was a lot of diversity, and I definitely aspired to have one of the houses at the top of the hill,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s what you don\u2019t get in these peripheral estates.\u201d Debbie\u2019s newborn baby asleep in the Scottish baby box, which provides a safe place to sleep and comes full of baby essentials. The box was introduced by the Scottish government in 2017 to tackle infant poverty rates and is designed to give each child born in Scotland \u2018the best start in life\u2019. Encouraged by a teacher, Mackay studied photography at Glasgow College before leaving for New York and London to work as assistant to photographers including Herb Ritts, Nick Knight and Anton Corbijn. She has an MA in documentary photography from the prestigious school of photography at the University of Wales and has said that her work is fuelled by \u201cinjustice on any scale\u201d. Now settled in Bristol, she published her first book, My Favourite Colour Was Yellow, an exploration of the colour pink and the way it\u2019s pressed on young girls, in 2017. Mackay\u2019s accent may have softened over the years since she left but, she says, Glasgow still feels like home \u2013 and her mother still lives in the flat she grew up in. \u201cI\u2019m an insider and an outsider,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I was making this work I was really aware of that.\u201d A young man shows off his \u2018carry-out\u2019 of vodka outside Drumchapel shopping centre. \u2018I\u2019d like to take the narrative away from the symptoms of these health inequalities towards the root causes,\u2019 says Mackay. \u2018The focus needs to shift from the individual to the legacy of political policy.\u2019 That sense of being an outsider meant she sometimes questioned her right to make the series, but two factors spurred her on.

But second, she hopes to add more insight from her subjects, because \u201cit\u2019s the people with lived experience that have the answers. \u201cI\u2019m travelling all around the city, talking, and most crucially listening, to a diverse group of people,\u201d she says. \u201cI see myself a bit like a conductor bringing all these voices and life experiences together; my hope is that the result will be a chorus of voices that point the way to the next chapter of action.\u201d To this end, the series will be published as a book next year and there\u2019s also a documentary film in the making. Liz lost her partner Andy to suicide in 2015, and is pictured here wearing his jacket. \u2018He died about a week before his 28th birthday. If he\u2019d have had professional help things could\u2019ve been a lot different. I think there is help out there, but it\u2019s very hard to access.\u2019 Mackay says she usually takes the time to get to know her subjects, collaborating with them on their portraits and frequently photographing them at home. One lady wanted to get her hair done and change her outfit before their session, for example, another wanted to be shot looking sultry. \u201cShe said \u2018When I die, use this picture of me at the funeral,\u2019\u201d says Mackay. \u201cThat\u2019s really the highest compliment.\u201d She works this way not only because she doesn\u2019t want to depict her subjects as victims but also because it\u2019s important that the images reflect the sense of personal pride that people in Glasgow have, despite \u2013 or perhaps because of \u2013 the challenging circumstances in which some of them live. \u201cPeople take a lot of care over how they present themselves to the world. Their houses are spotless and they put money into dressing their kids,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s something they have power over.\u201d Kaitlin, 23, at home in Springburn. \u2018I\u2019ve been diagnosed with a chronic illness, been through two blocks of therapy, left uni, started a new job,\u2019 she says. \u2018I feel it in my bones that good things are going to happen for me soon. I am powerful amazing and ready.\u2019 Kirsty Mackay will be showing work from this project as part of the group show Distinctly at the Williamson Art Gallery and Museum in Birkenhead, Wirral, 28 September to 24 November",

Now both are behaving like viciously intolerant sects. \u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer",

As Ben and I, and another Twitter acquaintance called Tom, rode out of Otley, north of Leeds, there were dozens of other riders heading out of town, up Wharfedale towards Bolton Abbey.

The first problem is that they sneak up on you. In the Alps, you can see a climb coming for miles as you approach along the valley. In Yorkshire, the roads undulate all the time.

And here is something else: in other cycling meccas, the climbs have hairpins to even out the gradient. In Yorkshire, the roads go straight up. The climbs are not long, but they are steep. It\u2019s not at all unusual to find yourself out of the saddle, grunting to get the pedals round on a one-in-five gradient.</p> <p>This sort of thing might punish the unwary outsider, but it manufactures great bike riders, such as Brian Robinson, the first British Tour de France stage winner, in 1958; Barry Hoban, who won eight Tour stages between 1967 and 1975; and world champion Tom Simpson, who grew up in Harworth, Nottinghamshire, but learned his riding over the border. Deignan will get to race through her home town at this year\u2019s Worlds. And, of course, there\u2019s the peerless Beryl Burton, winner of seven world titles in the 1960s and 70s and an astonishing 72 UK titles at various distances between 1958 and 1986.</p> <p>It\u2019s the relentlessness of the roads that makes it different. You have to work for everything. An hour\u2019s ride in Yorkshire is worth an hour-and-a-quarter in most other places. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that the roads are hard \u2013 the weather can be bad, too,\u201d said Deignan. \u201cWhen I turned pro, I\u2019d find myself riding up some French mountain in the pouring rain, and that was fine.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bbfa6c2b3dc2ae12d1384e405b1568504e3b1ca2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bbfa6c2b3dc2ae12d1384e405b1568504e3b1ca2/0_553_5159_3095/1000.jpg\" alt=\"View over Buttertubs pass in The Yorkshire Dales.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">View over Buttertubs pass in The Yorkshire Dales.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The C\u00f4te de Buttertubs is brutally steep, an incline of almost one in five.

Just a few minutes away from the little town of Hawes, it feels untouched and wild.</p> <p>It\u2019s barren and exposed, with no shelter beyond some low drystone walls. There are no trees on Buttertubs; even the grass is close cropped by the sheep. The narrow road clings to the side of the steep valley then turns inland to run through a natural amphitheatre which, when the race arrives, will be crowded with fans and flags. It\u2019s the essence of Yorkshire, and it\u2019s utterly lovely. The climb took us about 20 minutes \u2013 the pros will probably do it in 13.</p> <p>But 200km was, as I\u2019d been warned, too much. By the time we were heading back south towards Ripon and Harrogate, I was finding every excuse I could to freewheel for a moment\u2019s respite. More than once I tried freewheeling only to discover that I wasn\u2019t even going downhill, I just desperately wanted to be. Of course, I didn\u2019t say anything. I was pleased beyond words when Tom said he was exhausted, too. \u201cGo on ahead, if you want to get back,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s OK,\u201d I said magnanimously. \u201cLet\u2019s back off a bit.

      "bodyText": "I have achieved a sort of cycling singularity. The UK cycling scene is obsessed with professional racing, hills, Yorkshire, social media \u2013 and pretentious coffee. And a couple of weeks ago, I set out to ride the undulating West and North Yorkshire route of the 2019 Road World Championships with a small-batch coffee roaster called Ben whom I\u2019d met on Twitter. Over the past five years, Yorkshire has become a global cycling destination. As Ben and I, and another Twitter acquaintance called Tom, rode out of Otley, north of Leeds, there were dozens of other riders heading out of town, up Wharfedale towards Bolton Abbey. None of them was in an organised group \u2013 just ones and twos, including quite a few children and teenagers. I doubt many of them were doing what we were planning: a 200km section of the men\u2019s elite race, involving a long loop north from Otley to Hawes, east up the gloriously named Buttertubs Pass, and then south through Ripon to finish in Harrogate. I\u2019d mentioned my plans to Otley native and 2015 world champion Lizzie Deignan. \u201cIf I press on a bit it shouldn\u2019t take more than about six hours,\u201d I said. There was a pause. \u201cI think you might have underestimated that,\u201d she replied. I found it hard to find volunteers to keep me company. I asked the local Otley club. \u201cBit too much for most of us,\u201d was the response. I was undeterred. I shouldn\u2019t have been. The explosion in Yorkshire cycling hasn\u2019t happened by accident.

Born two years after Castro\u2019s revolution in the sugar farming region of Cienfuegos, he grew up to be a welder working in civil aviation. He was nearly 30 when a visit to a show of surrealist photographs inspired him to pick up a camera. At first, he photographed weddings at weekends, but eventually he gave up his day job and moved out on to the streets.</p> <p>His vocation did not arrive at a good moment. The US embargo on trade with Cuba, and the collapse of the Soviet Union, meant that materials, which had mostly come from East Germany, were in short supply. Ca\u00f1ibano had to work with expired photographic stock, and was thus limited in the number of pictures he could take, which made each composition an event.</p> <p>The challenges in making the images seem to add to their value. Ca\u00f1ibano works now as a commercial photographer in Cuba, but the ongoing series captures a complex yearning for the countryside of his childhood: \u201cThe child in this picture, the son of peasants,\u201d he said recently, \u201cwas playing just like these children do; in a different way to city children because their playthings are the countryside and everything that surrounds them.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://thephotographersgallery.org.uk/whats-on/commercial-exhibition/raul-canibano-chronicles-island?mc_cid=39a874c353&amp;mc_eid=211520b995\" title=\"\"><em>Ra\u00fal Ca\u00f1ibano: Chronicles of an Island</em></a><em> is on at the Print Sales space of the Photographers\u2019 Gallery, London W1, until</em><em> 17 November</em></p>",

Ca\u00f1ibano, now 58, was not always a photographer. Born two years after Castro\u2019s revolution in the sugar farming region of Cienfuegos, he grew up to be a welder working in civil aviation. He was nearly 30 when a visit to a show of surrealist photographs inspired him to pick up a camera. At first, he photographed weddings at weekends, but eventually he gave up his day job and moved out on to the streets. His vocation did not arrive at a good moment. The US embargo on trade with Cuba, and the collapse of the Soviet Union, meant that materials, which had mostly come from East Germany, were in short supply. Ca\u00f1ibano had to work with expired photographic stock, and was thus limited in the number of pictures he could take, which made each composition an event. The challenges in making the images seem to add to their value. Ca\u00f1ibano works now as a commercial photographer in Cuba, but the ongoing series captures a complex yearning for the countryside of his childhood: \u201cThe child in this picture, the son of peasants,\u201d he said recently, \u201cwas playing just like these children do; in a different way to city children because their playthings are the countryside and everything that surrounds them.\u201d Ra\u00fal Ca\u00f1ibano: Chronicles of an Island is on at the Print Sales space of the Photographers\u2019 Gallery, London W1, until 17 November",

Great progress has been made, says <a href=\"http://leigh.hochberg.com/\" title=\"\">Leigh Hochberg</a>, a neurologist at Massachusetts general hospital and an engineering professor at Brown University who co-directs the BrainGate programme, but \u201ca system that patients can use around the clock that reliably provides complete, rapid, intuitive brain control over a computer does not yet exist\u201d.</p> <p>Help may be at hand. An injection of Silicon Valley chutzpah has energised the field of brain-computer or brain-machine interfaces in recent years. Buoyed by BrainGate and other demonstrations, big-name entrepreneurs and companies and scrappy startups are on a quest to develop a new generation of commercial hardware that could ultimately help not only Degray and others with disabilities, but be used by all of us. While some, including Facebook, are pursuing non-invasive versions, wireless neural implant systems are also being worked on.</p> <p>In July Elon Musk, best known as the CEO of the electric car company Tesla, presented details of an implantable wireless system that his company <a href=\"https://www.neuralink.com/\" title=\"\">Neuralink</a> is building. It is already being studied in monkeys, Musk revealed, and it is hoped that human trials will start before the end of 2020. To date, Neuralink has received $158m in funding, $100m of it from Musk.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Elon Musk worries about the threat posed by artificial intelligence and claims BCIs\u00a0may provide a way of keeping\u00a0up with it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>While the implant being developed is still the same size as one of the Utah arrays in Degray\u2019s brain, it has far more electrodes, meaning it can record from far more neurons. While a Utah array \u2013 of which up to four or five can be inserted \u2013 typically has 100 electrodes, Neuralink says its version will have more like 1,000. And the company thinks it is feasible to place up to 10. Very thin threads of flexible biocompatible polymer material studded with electrodes would be \u201csewn in\u201d by a robot to avoid piercing microvessels, which Neuralink hopes would ameliorate scarring, thereby increasing how long the device lasted. \u201cOur goal is to record from and stimulate spikes in neurons in a way that is orders of magnitude more than anything that has been done to date and safe and good enough that it is not like a major operation,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/the-future-brain/201907/how-elon-musks-neuralink-plans-unify-the-brain-ai\" title=\"\">said Musk in </a><a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/the-future-brain/201907/how-elon-musks-neuralink-plans-unify-the-brain-ai\" title=\"\">his presentation</a>, adding that the procedure would be more like laser eye surgery than brain surgery. Medical concerns drive the device\u2019s development, according to Musk, but he also worries about the threat posed by artificial intelligence and believes this could provide a way of keeping up with it.</p> <p>There are smaller rival startups too. <a href=\"https://paradromics.com/\" title=\"\">Paradromics</a>, like Neuralink, is focused on many more and smaller electrodes but is aiming for an even higher density of probes over the face of its neural implant. In form, their device would look closer to the Utah array \u2013 a bed of needles with metal electrodes \u2013 and there would be no robotic surgery. \u201cWe want to hit the market as soon as possible,\u201d says founder and CEO Matt Angle adding the hope is to begin a clinical trial in the early 2020s. The company has raised about $25m in funding to date including significant amounts from the Pentagon\u2019s research agency, Darpa, which grew interested in BCIs after it realised the sophisticated robotic limbs it was building for injured soldiers returning from overseas needed brain control. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8b81a857c443666bcd1a5e8bbf86947345df3d00\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b81a857c443666bcd1a5e8bbf86947345df3d00/0_0_2534_1297/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dennis Degray uses Utah array implants to manipulate the cursor on a computer screen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"512\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dennis Degray uses Utah array implants to manipulate the cursor on a computer screen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PBS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.synchronmed.com/\" title=\"\">Synchron, based in Australia and </a><a href=\"https://www.synchronmed.com/\" title=\"\">Silicon Valley,</a> has a different approach. The company, which has received $21m in funding to date, including some from Darpa, last week revealed that the first clinical trial of its Stentrode device had begun in Australia \u2013 ahead of both Neuralink and Paradromics.</p> <p>The device avoids open brain surgery and scarring because it is inserted using a stent through a vein in the back of the neck. Once in position next to the motor cortex, the stent splays out to embed 16 metal electrodes into the blood vessel\u2019s walls from which neuronal activity can be recorded. So far in the trial one patient \u2013 paralysed with motor neurone disease \u2013 has been implanted, with four others set to follow. The device\u2019s safety will be studied along with how well the system allows brain control of a computer for typing and texting. While it can only read the aggregate activity of a population of neurons, of which it will take in about 1,000, there is enough data to make a system useful for patients \u2013 and less nuance in the signal actually makes it more stable and robust, says founder and CEO Tom Oxley.</p> <p>Meanwhile, challenges remain for Neuralink and Paradromics. Whether scarring can be mitigated by very small electrodes is yet to be seen. There is also the issue of the electrodes being dissolved and corroded by the body \u2013 a problem that gets worse the smaller they are. How long Neuralink\u2019s new polymer probes will last is unknown.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Beyond typing, no one is too specific. Brain commands to smart\u00a0speakers? Brain-to-brain communication? Enhanced memory?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cNo one is going to be super impressed with the startup companies until they start recording their lifetimes in years. The Utah array has a lot of issues \u2013 but you do measure its lifetime in years,\u201d says Cynthia Chestek, a neural interface researcher at the University of Michigan. Then, even if we are able to record all these extra neuron signals, could we decode them? \u201cWe have no idea how the brain works,\u201d says Takashi Kozai, a biomedical engineer at the University of Pittsburgh who studies implantable technologies. \u201cTrying to decode that information and actually produce something useful is a huge problem.\u201d Chestek agrees that more understanding of how neurons compute things would be helpful, but \u201cevery algorithm out there\u201d would suddenly just start doing better with a few hundred extra neurons.</p> <p>None of the three companies sees nonmedical applications in the short term, but argue that the implant technology could gradually branch out into the general population as people start seeing how transformational it can be.</p> <p>The most obvious application may be brain-controlled typing. Oxley imagines a scenario where people who have grown up texting and typing \u2013 and are wholly dependent on their fingers for that \u2013 lose functionality as they age. Frustrated that they can\u2019t maintain their speed, they may seek other ways to preserve their technological capability. Eventually a tipping point will occur as people see BCIs working better than the human body. \u201cIf the technology becomes safe, it\u2019s easy to use and it provides you with superior technology control, there will be people who will want to pay for that,\u201d says Oxley.</p> <p>Of uses beyond that, no one is being specific. Brain commands to smart speakers? Brain-controlled car driving? Brain-to-brain communication? Enhanced memory and cognition?</p> <p>If the technology were to make it outside the medical domain, the military is where we might see it first, says Dr Hannah Maslen, deputy director of the University of Oxford\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics</a>. For example, it might provide silent communication between soldiers or allow activation of equipment by the thinking of certain commands. It is hard to see most people opting to undergo a surgical intervention for recreational or convenience uses, she adds. But at a recent neurotechnology meetup in San Francisco of about two dozen tinkerers, <a href=\"http://toom.im/\" title=\"\">Jonathan Toomim</a> argued it was a logical next step. \u201cWe already use devices \u2013 our smart phones \u2013 that offload a lot of our cognition and augment our memory. This is just bringing the bandwidth between the human brain and those to a higher level,\u201d said the self-described neuroscientist, engineer, entrepreneur and environmentalist, who makes his own neurofeedback gear.</p> <p>The public should have a clear voice in shaping how neural interface technology is used and regulated over the coming years, concluded a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/sep/10/neural-revolution-royal-society-calls-for-inquiry-into-new-wave-of-brain-implants\" title=\"\">report</a> this month on the topic from the UK Royal Society. One concern is data privacy, though Maslen says this should be tempered by the fact that while BCIs may be portrayed as being able to \u201cmind read\u201d and \u201cdecode thoughts\u201d \u2013 stoking fears that they will unearth innermost secrets \u2013 they are recording from very small areas of the brain mostly related to movement, and require the user\u2019s mental effort to make them work. \u201cEthical concerns around privacy \u2026 don\u2019t apply in such a full way,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"89f199c0373a52871c5a2cde98301a196772c811\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89f199c0373a52871c5a2cde98301a196772c811/0_0_1280_1280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A sewing machine-like robot that inserts electrodes into the brain, under development by Neuralink.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A sewing machine-like robot that inserts electrodes into the brain, under development by Neuralink.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NEURALINK</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nonetheless, questions remain. Who owns the brain data and what is it being used for? And \u201cbrainjacking\u201d, where a third party could gain control of the system and modify it in ways the brain\u2019s owner has not consented to, is rooted in reality rather than science fiction says Maslen \u2013 pacemakers have been hacked before. Paradromics\u2019 Matt Angle wonders to what extent data from BCIs could be used as evidence in court \u2013 for example to incriminate someone in the same way a diary or a computer might.</p> <p>Further ethical issues arise around control and agency. If a brain implant doesn\u2019t get your intention right, to what extent are you as the user of the device responsible for what is \u201csaid\u201d or done? And how do we ensure that if a technology confers significant benefits, it is not just the rich who get it?</p> <p>Society still has a few years to ponder these questions. Neuralink\u2019s aim of getting a human clinical trial up and running by the end of next year is widely considered too ambitious, given what remains unproved. But many experts anticipate that the technology will be available for people with impairments or disabilities within five or 10 years. For nonmedical use, the timeframe is greater \u2013 perhaps 20 years. For Leigh Hochberg, the focus has to be on helping those who need it most. Says Degray of Neuralink\u2019s device: \u201cI would have one implanted this afternoon if I could.\u201d</p> <h2>Is there an alternative to implants?</h2> <p>A worn, non-invasive brain computer interface which doesn\u2019t involve brain surgery and can always be taken off may seem attractive. But the skull muffles the reading of neuronal signals. \u201cThe physics [of a non-invasive device] are just extremely challenging\u201d says Cynthia Chestek of the University of Michigan.</p> <p>Some companies are trying anyway. Facebook announced in 2017 it wanted to create a wearable device that would allow typing from the brain at 100 words per minute (as a comparison, Neuralink is striving for 40 words per minute \u2013 which is around our average typing speed \u2013 and the BrainGate programme which uses Utah array implants has achieved about 8 words per minute, without word prediction). This July, researchers at the University of California funded by the social network showed decoding of a small set of full, spoken words and phrases from brain activity in real time for the first time \u2013 though it was done with so-called electrocorticography electrodes laid on the surface of the brain via surgery. Meanwhile the company <a href=\"https://tech.fb.com/imagining-a-new-interface-hands-free-communication-without-saying-a-word/\" title=\"\">continues to work</a> on how it might achieve the same thing non-invasively and is exploring measuring changing patterns in blood oxygenation \u2013 neurons use oxygen when they are active \u2013 with near-infrared light.</p> <p>Also on the case is Los Angeles-based startup <a href=\"https://kernel.co/\" title=\"\">Kernel</a>, founded by entrepreneur <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2017/dec/14/humans-20-meet-the-entrepreneur-who-wants-to-put-a-chip-in-your-brain\" title=\"\">Bryan Johnson</a> who made millions selling mobile payments company Braintree to PayPal. Kernel, into which Johnson has put $100m, started as a neural implants company but then pivoted to wearables because, Johnson says, the invasive road looked so long. Plenty of non-invasive methods exist for sensing and stimulating brain activity (indeed they form the basis of a large consumer neurotechnology industry). But none, says Johnson, is equal to being bridged into a next-generation interface. New ways are needed, and he believes Kernel has found one others have missed. \u201cWe will be ready to share more in 2020,\u201d he says.</p> <p>But assuming the technical challenges can be surmounted, social factors could still be a barrier, says <a href=\"http://www.annawexler.com/\" title=\"\">Anna Wexler</a>, who studies the ethical, legal and social implications of emerging neurotechnology at the University of Pennsylvania. Google Glass failed not because it didn\u2019t work but because people didn\u2019t want to wear a face computer. Will anyone trust Facebook enough to use their device if it does develop one?</p>",

Then, even if we are able to record all these extra neuron signals, could we decode them? \u201cWe have no idea how the brain works,\u201d says Takashi Kozai, a biomedical engineer at the University of Pittsburgh who studies implantable technologies. \u201cTrying to decode that information and actually produce something useful is a huge problem.\u201d Chestek agrees that more understanding of how neurons compute things would be helpful, but \u201cevery algorithm out there\u201d would suddenly just start doing better with a few hundred extra neurons. None of the three companies sees nonmedical applications in the short term, but argue that the implant technology could gradually branch out into the general population as people start seeing how transformational it can be. The most obvious application may be brain-controlled typing. Oxley imagines a scenario where people who have grown up texting and typing \u2013 and are wholly dependent on their fingers for that \u2013 lose functionality as they age. Frustrated that they can\u2019t maintain their speed, they may seek other ways to preserve their technological capability. Eventually a tipping point will occur as people see BCIs working better than the human body. \u201cIf the technology becomes safe, it\u2019s easy to use and it provides you with superior technology control, there will be people who will want to pay for that,\u201d says Oxley. Of uses beyond that, no one is being specific. Brain commands to smart speakers? Brain-controlled car driving? Brain-to-brain communication? Enhanced memory and cognition? If the technology were to make it outside the medical domain, the military is where we might see it first, says Dr Hannah Maslen, deputy director of the University of Oxford\u2019s Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics. For example, it might provide silent communication between soldiers or allow activation of equipment by the thinking of certain commands. It is hard to see most people opting to undergo a surgical intervention for recreational or convenience uses, she adds. But at a recent neurotechnology meetup in San Francisco of about two dozen tinkerers, Jonathan Toomim argued it was a logical next step. \u201cWe already use devices \u2013 our smart phones \u2013 that offload a lot of our cognition and augment our memory. This is just bringing the bandwidth between the human brain and those to a higher level,\u201d said the self-described neuroscientist, engineer, entrepreneur and environmentalist, who makes his own neurofeedback gear. The public should have a clear voice in shaping how neural interface technology is used and regulated over the coming years, concluded a report this month on the topic from the UK Royal Society. One concern is data privacy, though Maslen says this should be tempered by the fact that while BCIs may be portrayed as being able to \u201cmind read\u201d and \u201cdecode thoughts\u201d \u2013 stoking fears that they will unearth innermost secrets \u2013 they are recording from very small areas of the brain mostly related to movement, and require the user\u2019s mental effort to make them work. \u201cEthical concerns around privacy \u2026 don\u2019t apply in such a full way,\u201d she says. Nonetheless, questions remain. Who owns the brain data and what is it being used for? And \u201cbrainjacking\u201d, where a third party could gain control of the system and modify it in ways the brain\u2019s owner has not consented to, is rooted in reality rather than science fiction says Maslen \u2013 pacemakers have been hacked before. Paradromics\u2019 Matt Angle wonders to what extent data from BCIs could be used as evidence in court \u2013 for example to incriminate someone in the same way a diary or a computer might. Further ethical issues arise around control and agency. If a brain implant doesn\u2019t get your intention right, to what extent are you as the user of the device responsible for what is \u201csaid\u201d or done? And how do we ensure that if a technology confers significant benefits, it is not just the rich who get it? Society still has a few years to ponder these questions. Neuralink\u2019s aim of getting a human clinical trial up and running by the end of next year is widely considered too ambitious, given what remains unproved. But many experts anticipate that the technology will be available for people with impairments or disabilities within five or 10 years. For nonmedical use, the timeframe is greater \u2013 perhaps 20 years. For Leigh Hochberg, the focus has to be on helping those who need it most. Says Degray of Neuralink\u2019s device: \u201cI would have one implanted this afternoon if I could.\u201d Is there an alternative to implants? A worn, non-invasive brain computer interface which doesn\u2019t involve brain surgery and can always be taken off may seem attractive. But the skull muffles the reading of neuronal signals. \u201cThe physics [of a non-invasive device] are just extremely challenging\u201d says Cynthia Chestek of the University of Michigan. Some companies are trying anyway. Facebook announced in 2017 it wanted to create a wearable device that would allow typing from the brain at 100 words per minute (as a comparison, Neuralink is striving for 40 words per minute \u2013 which is around our average typing speed \u2013 and the BrainGate programme which uses Utah array implants has achieved about 8 words per minute, without word prediction). This July, researchers at the University of California funded by the social network showed decoding of a small set of full, spoken words and phrases from brain activity in real time for the first time \u2013 though it was done with so-called electrocorticography electrodes laid on the surface of the brain via surgery. Meanwhile the company continues to work on how it might achieve the same thing non-invasively and is exploring measuring changing patterns in blood oxygenation \u2013 neurons use oxygen when they are active \u2013 with near-infrared light. Also on the case is Los Angeles-based startup Kernel, founded by entrepreneur Bryan Johnson who made millions selling mobile payments company Braintree to PayPal. Kernel, into which Johnson has put $100m, started as a neural implants company but then pivoted to wearables because, Johnson says, the invasive road looked so long. Plenty of non-invasive methods exist for sensing and stimulating brain activity (indeed they form the basis of a large consumer neurotechnology industry). But none, says Johnson, is equal to being bridged into a next-generation interface. New ways are needed, and he believes Kernel has found one others have missed. \u201cWe will be ready to share more in 2020,\u201d he says. But assuming the technical challenges can be surmounted, social factors could still be a barrier, says Anna Wexler, who studies the ethical, legal and social implications of emerging neurotechnology at the University of Pennsylvania. Google Glass failed not because it didn\u2019t work but because people didn\u2019t want to wear a face computer. Will anyone trust Facebook enough to use their device if it does develop one?",

Since 2012, Kabov has travelled to international art fairs to represent her artists and boost the international profile of the country in the contemporary art world. \u201cZimbabweans themselves are not aware of the extreme talent in their midst, because it is not considered an indigenous tradition,\u201d she said. The devastating economic legacy of Mugabe\u2019s 40 year rule means artists in the former British colony face many obstacles: a lack of exhibition spaces, limited opportunities to sell their work and difficulties getting basic supplies of artistic materials. Teede is concerned that the lack of a major domestic art market will mean that little work currently being produced remains in the country. \u201cThere\u2019s always been a crazy amount of talent here \u2026 But all the best work that is being produced at this super exciting time is being sold overseas and that is a big loss.

There were street protests and angry scenes at a city council meeting after Jean\u2019s death. A Dallas civil rights group, the Next Generation Action Network, plans to hold a rally outside the courthouse on Monday. The head of the Dallas police association called for the trial to be delayed on the basis that resources will be stretched by the city hosting the state fair of Texas, a suggestion that Lee Merritt, a lawyer for Jean\u2019s family, described on Twitter as \u201cabsurd and contemptible\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Neville Chamberlain died in November 1940, just six months after the bankruptcy of his policy of appeasement towards Hitler had forced his resignation as prime minister. This was unlucky because he did not live long enough to write a memoir trying to justify himself. This was lucky because he was not around to hear himself being pilloried as one of the most calamitous leaders in British history.</p> <p>David Cameron, who was an ex-PM at the young age of 49, is doomed to be remembered as a Chamberlain-class prime minister and fated to know it. Now and for ever more, he will be defined by the one epic misjudgment that terminated his time at Number 10 and hurled his country into the vortex of chaos in which it is still trapped more than three years later. In the unlikely event that Brexit ultimately proves to be a brilliant idea, he will not be able to claim any credit for an enterprise that he opposed. In the rather more likely event that leaving the EU proves to be the gravest error in Britain\u2019s modern history, he will rightly shoulder a vast weight of the blame. And in the event that Brexit is reversed, Cameron will be remembered as the man who put his country through years of polarising trauma for no purpose.</p> <p>Brexit is the giant, dark cumulonimbus that squats over the pages of this long memoir from its first sentence. You can sense that the author dreaded arriving at the chapters where he would have to explain himself, for the earlier ones are bulked up with some stodgy padding that could have benefited from more ruthless editing.</p> <p>In the build-up to the breaking of the storm that sweeps away his career, the tone is largely sunny. He is amusing about the \u201ctiny gene pool\u201d at his hideous prep school, the classic posh English combination of privilege and brutality, where the Duke of Bedford and Prince Edward were among the \u201cdorm captains\u201d and the \u201cspartan diet\u201d included a dish of \u201ccurry, rice and maggots\u201d. He is moving about his son, Ivan, writing of his death: \u201cIt was as if the world stopped turning.\u201d He tends to the bland when discussing other leaders, but there are a few tangy titbits. I enjoyed the anecdote about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/silvio-berlusconi\" title=\"\">Silvio Berlusconi</a> taking Cameron into the then Italian prime minister\u2019s bedroom, showing off an ancient two-way mirror and explaining: \u201cThey didn\u2019t have porn channels in the 15th century.\u201d He reminds us that he was occasionally brave as prime minister, legislating for gay marriage against the fierce opposition of reactionaries in his party. One Tory came to the constituency surgery to tear up his membership card in front of Cameron.</p> <p>The book\u2019s voice is not as humble as the interviews he has given to promote it. There are lengthy tracts of self-justification as he relitigates every controversy of his career before almost invariably coming to the conclusion: \u201cI was right.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f453a02be223c6cfd7759e8b1a8209c739d942e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f453a02be223c6cfd7759e8b1a8209c739d942e/0_0_3500_2453/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cameron and Boris Johnson, an \u2018ambassador for the truth-twisting age of populism\u2019, in north-west London, 2014\" width=\"1000\" height=\"701\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cameron and Boris Johnson, an \u2018ambassador for the truth-twisting age of populism\u2019, in north-west London, 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When he addresses the choice that immolated his premiership, Cameron is sufficiently sensible to know that a tsunami of derision would have come down on his head if he did not admit to some mistakes. So he agrees that he underestimated the toxifying effects on public opinion of years of rubbishing of the EU by the Tory party and its media. He accepts that he ought to have made a more positive case for membership. He just about acknowledges that he chose the worst possible time to hold the referendum. What he cannot confess is that it was a terrible mistake to make that cavalier promise in the first place when he had not a clue what he would extract from his \u201crenegotiation\u201d with the EU and no idea what the atmospherics would be like when he had to make good on the pledge. He continues to insist that a referendum was \u201cnecessary and, I believe, ultimately inevitable\u201d. Here he is hiding from the truth, probably because confronting it would be too much to bear. Far from being \u201cnecessary\u201d or \u201cinevitable\u201d, there was no nationwide clamour for a vote on EU membership when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jan/23/david-cameron-eu-referendum-eurosceptic-tories\" title=\"\">he made the pledge in 2013</a>. Europe rarely made the top five when pollsters asked voters to tell them which issues were bothering them most. Cameron \u201cresents\u201d the accusation that he made the promise because he had a party management problem with a fervent minority on the right only later to half concede that this was indeed a factor in his calculations. \u201cI don\u2019t argue that the referendum pledge had nothing to do with party politics.\u201d It was not a courageous decision arrived at in the national interest; it was a cowardly one made in a panic by a leader running scared of Nigel Farage and the ultras in the Tory party.</p> <p>One value of this memoir is that it offers some character clues about why his career soared and then self-destructed. He was born into home counties upper-middle-class affluence. As a teenager, he was nagged by the thought that he was \u201cslightly mediocre\u201d with \u201ca weakness for going with the crowd, even when the crowd was heading in the wrong direction\u201d, but insulated by a dash of charm. At Eton, he spent summer afternoons with friends getting \u201cgently off our heads\u201d smoking hash. Caught, he swerves expulsion by telling \u201cmore and more elaborate lies\u201d. It may have been then that he first started thinking that there was no scrape he could not wriggle out of. At Oxford, \u201cI fell in love. Lots of times.\u201d That\u2019s a sentence that doesn\u2019t sound as attractive as he thinks it does.</p> <p>Before he reached No 10, he was once asked why he thought he should be prime minister. \u201cBecause I would be good at it,\u201d was his glibly insouciant reply. I recall being invited to lunch with him in Downing Street early on in his premiership. Knowing that many previous occupants of the office have found its responsibilities a shock, I asked what had surprised him about being prime minister. \u201cNothing really,\u201d he replied, a nonchalance he intended to be reassuring, but which I found a bit disturbing. This hubris swelled with time. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/19/scotland-independence-no-vote-victory-alex-salmond\" title=\"\">defeat of Scottish independence</a> in 2014 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/08/british-pm-david-cameron-confounds-polls-to-win-second-term\" title=\"\">his election win a year later</a> were both squeaky bum campaigns and the victories ultimately achieved were by quite tight margins. Rather than conclude from this that he had been fortunate to pull them off, he started to believe there was no gamble he could not risk and win.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec32286d261736da61cbfbe80cc4aa91175dd25f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec32286d261736da61cbfbe80cc4aa91175dd25f/0_0_3333_5000/667.jpg\" alt=\"Inside his office at Number 10, June 2016\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inside his office at Number 10, June 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cabinet colleagues considered Cameron to be smart, but not an original thinker. Others first conceived the Tory \u201cmodernisation project\u201d that he used to rebrand them in opposition. His response to the economic situation that he inherited in 2010 was a highly conventional and painful dose of fiscal contraction that exploded his pretensions to build a \u201cbig society\u201d and undid a lot of his previous effort trying to prove that the Tories were no longer \u201cthe nasty party\u201d. You can now find quite a lot of Conservatives who think they overdid austerity. Cameron believes the opposite, arguing that \u201cwe might as well have ripped the plaster off with more cuts early on\u201d. He doesn\u2019t join any of the dots between the squeeze on disadvantaged communities and the increasing alienation among the \u201cleft behind\u201d that helped to power the Leave vote.</p> <p>He thinks himself a good judge of character and yet was often anything but. He gave a senior job at No 10 to Andy Coulson, the former newspaper editor who was later jailed for his part in the phone-hacking scandal. He made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/15/steve-hilton-im-rich-but-i-understand-the-frustrations-people-have\" title=\"\">Steve Hilton</a> \u2013 \u201cone part brilliant to several parts bonkers\u201d \u2013 his principal strategist at No 10 only for Hilton to quit in frustration at what he saw as Cameron\u2019s lack of radicalism and later campaign on the other side of the Brexit divide. He lubricated the ascent of Boris Johnson and promoted Michael Gove, the duo who would be his nemesis as the \u201cambassadors for the expert-trashing, truth-twisting age of populism\u201d. The two frontmen of the Leave campaign are the principal villains of Cameron\u2019s account. Johnson \u201cdidn\u2019t believe in Brexit\u201d and \u201crisked an outcome he didn\u2019t believe in because it would help his political career\u201d. The \u201cmendacious\u201d Gove, a man he had counted as \u201cone of my best friends\u201d, was serially treacherous and turned into a \u201cfoam-flecked Faragist\u201d. These are not original accusations, but the charges have additional force when they are levelled by their former leader and chum. Here, the memoir oozes bitterness from the still weeping wounds of a man who feels betrayed. When Gove subsequently does the dirty on Johnson, Cameron sends Johnson a text: \u201cYou should have stuck with me, mate.\u201d Johnson responds: \u201cBlimey, is he (Gove) a bit cracked or something?\u201d</p> <p>How incestuous they are, even when at one another\u2019s throats, this clique of frenemies who have wielded so much influence over Britain in the years since 2010. Cameron likes to bemoan the way in which Brexit became a \u201cTory psychodrama\u201d, but he was the actor-manager who put the dysfunctional cast of this never-ending tragi-farce on the stage and trapped the whole of Britain in their theatre of the absurd.</p> <p>Theresa May was never one of the gang. When they fell out, Cameron looked to her to be an instrument of his revenge on Johnson and Gove. Although he posed as a neutral in the contest to succeed him, he reveals that he secretly gave encouragement to May\u2019s leadership campaign. When she became prime minister, \u201cI felt relieved that I would be passing the responsibility to a safe pair of hands.\u201d That was another misreading of character that failed to anticipate what she would do with the premiership.

      "bodyText": "Neville Chamberlain died in November 1940, just six months after the bankruptcy of his policy of appeasement towards Hitler had forced his resignation as prime minister. This was unlucky because he did not live long enough to write a memoir trying to justify himself. This was lucky because he was not around to hear himself being pilloried as one of the most calamitous leaders in British history. David Cameron, who was an ex-PM at the young age of 49, is doomed to be remembered as a Chamberlain-class prime minister and fated to know it. Now and for ever more, he will be defined by the one epic misjudgment that terminated his time at Number 10 and hurled his country into the vortex of chaos in which it is still trapped more than three years later. In the unlikely event that Brexit ultimately proves to be a brilliant idea, he will not be able to claim any credit for an enterprise that he opposed. In the rather more likely event that leaving the EU proves to be the gravest error in Britain\u2019s modern history, he will rightly shoulder a vast weight of the blame. And in the event that Brexit is reversed, Cameron will be remembered as the man who put his country through years of polarising trauma for no purpose. Brexit is the giant, dark cumulonimbus that squats over the pages of this long memoir from its first sentence. You can sense that the author dreaded arriving at the chapters where he would have to explain himself, for the earlier ones are bulked up with some stodgy padding that could have benefited from more ruthless editing. In the build-up to the breaking of the storm that sweeps away his career, the tone is largely sunny. He is amusing about the \u201ctiny gene pool\u201d at his hideous prep school, the classic posh English combination of privilege and brutality, where the Duke of Bedford and Prince Edward were among the \u201cdorm captains\u201d and the \u201cspartan diet\u201d included a dish of \u201ccurry, rice and maggots\u201d. He is moving about his son, Ivan, writing of his death: \u201cIt was as if the world stopped turning.\u201d He tends to the bland when discussing other leaders, but there are a few tangy titbits. I enjoyed the anecdote about Silvio Berlusconi taking Cameron into the then Italian prime minister\u2019s bedroom, showing off an ancient two-way mirror and explaining: \u201cThey didn\u2019t have porn channels in the 15th century.\u201d He reminds us that he was occasionally brave as prime minister, legislating for gay marriage against the fierce opposition of reactionaries in his party. One Tory came to the constituency surgery to tear up his membership card in front of Cameron. The book\u2019s voice is not as humble as the interviews he has given to promote it. There are lengthy tracts of self-justification as he relitigates every controversy of his career before almost invariably coming to the conclusion: \u201cI was right.\u201d When he addresses the choice that immolated his premiership, Cameron is sufficiently sensible to know that a tsunami of derision would have come down on his head if he did not admit to some mistakes. So he agrees that he underestimated the toxifying effects on public opinion of years of rubbishing of the EU by the Tory party and its media. He accepts that he ought to have made a more positive case for membership. He just about acknowledges that he chose the worst possible time to hold the referendum. What he cannot confess is that it was a terrible mistake to make that cavalier promise in the first place when he had not a clue what he would extract from his \u201crenegotiation\u201d with the EU and no idea what the atmospherics would be like when he had to make good on the pledge. He continues to insist that a referendum was \u201cnecessary and, I believe, ultimately inevitable\u201d. Here he is hiding from the truth, probably because confronting it would be too much to bear. Far from being \u201cnecessary\u201d or \u201cinevitable\u201d, there was no nationwide clamour for a vote on EU membership when he made the pledge in 2013. Europe rarely made the top five when pollsters asked voters to tell them which issues were bothering them most. Cameron \u201cresents\u201d the accusation that he made the promise because he had a party management problem with a fervent minority on the right only later to half concede that this was indeed a factor in his calculations. \u201cI don\u2019t argue that the referendum pledge had nothing to do with party politics.\u201d It was not a courageous decision arrived at in the national interest; it was a cowardly one made in a panic by a leader running scared of Nigel Farage and the ultras in the Tory party. One value of this memoir is that it offers some character clues about why his career soared and then self-destructed. He was born into home counties upper-middle-class affluence. As a teenager, he was nagged by the thought that he was \u201cslightly mediocre\u201d with \u201ca weakness for going with the crowd, even when the crowd was heading in the wrong direction\u201d, but insulated by a dash of charm. At Eton, he spent summer afternoons with friends getting \u201cgently off our heads\u201d smoking hash. Caught, he swerves expulsion by telling \u201cmore and more elaborate lies\u201d. It may have been then that he first started thinking that there was no scrape he could not wriggle out of. At Oxford, \u201cI fell in love. Lots of times.\u201d That\u2019s a sentence that doesn\u2019t sound as attractive as he thinks it does. Before he reached No 10, he was once asked why he thought he should be prime minister. \u201cBecause I would be good at it,\u201d was his glibly insouciant reply. I recall being invited to lunch with him in Downing Street early on in his premiership. Knowing that many previous occupants of the office have found its responsibilities a shock, I asked what had surprised him about being prime minister. \u201cNothing really,\u201d he replied, a nonchalance he intended to be reassuring, but which I found a bit disturbing. This hubris swelled with time. The defeat of Scottish independence in 2014 and his election win a year later were both squeaky bum campaigns and the victories ultimately achieved were by quite tight margins. Rather than conclude from this that he had been fortunate to pull them off, he started to believe there was no gamble he could not risk and win. Cabinet colleagues considered Cameron to be smart, but not an original thinker. Others first conceived the Tory \u201cmodernisation project\u201d that he used to rebrand them in opposition. His response to the economic situation that he inherited in 2010 was a highly conventional and painful dose of fiscal contraction that exploded his pretensions to build a \u201cbig society\u201d and undid a lot of his previous effort trying to prove that the Tories were no longer \u201cthe nasty party\u201d. You can now find quite a lot of Conservatives who think they overdid austerity. Cameron believes the opposite, arguing that \u201cwe might as well have ripped the plaster off with more cuts early on\u201d. He doesn\u2019t join any of the dots between the squeeze on disadvantaged communities and the increasing alienation among the \u201cleft behind\u201d that helped to power the Leave vote. He thinks himself a good judge of character and yet was often anything but. He gave a senior job at No 10 to Andy Coulson, the former newspaper editor who was later jailed for his part in the phone-hacking scandal. He made Steve Hilton \u2013 \u201cone part brilliant to several parts bonkers\u201d \u2013 his principal strategist at No 10 only for Hilton to quit in frustration at what he saw as Cameron\u2019s lack of radicalism and later campaign on the other side of the Brexit divide. He lubricated the ascent of Boris Johnson and promoted Michael Gove, the duo who would be his nemesis as the \u201cambassadors for the expert-trashing, truth-twisting age of populism\u201d. The two frontmen of the Leave campaign are the principal villains of Cameron\u2019s account. Johnson \u201cdidn\u2019t believe in Brexit\u201d and \u201crisked an outcome he didn\u2019t believe in because it would help his political career\u201d. The \u201cmendacious\u201d Gove, a man he had counted as \u201cone of my best friends\u201d, was serially treacherous and turned into a \u201cfoam-flecked Faragist\u201d. These are not original accusations, but the charges have additional force when they are levelled by their former leader and chum. Here, the memoir oozes bitterness from the still weeping wounds of a man who feels betrayed. When Gove subsequently does the dirty on Johnson, Cameron sends Johnson a text: \u201cYou should have stuck with me, mate.\u201d Johnson responds: \u201cBlimey, is he (Gove) a bit cracked or something?\u201d How incestuous they are, even when at one another\u2019s throats, this clique of frenemies who have wielded so much influence over Britain in the years since 2010. Cameron likes to bemoan the way in which Brexit became a \u201cTory psychodrama\u201d, but he was the actor-manager who put the dysfunctional cast of this never-ending tragi-farce on the stage and trapped the whole of Britain in their theatre of the absurd. Theresa May was never one of the gang. When they fell out, Cameron looked to her to be an instrument of his revenge on Johnson and Gove. Although he posed as a neutral in the contest to succeed him, he reveals that he secretly gave encouragement to May\u2019s leadership campaign. When she became prime minister, \u201cI felt relieved that I would be passing the responsibility to a safe pair of hands.\u201d That was another misreading of character that failed to anticipate what she would do with the premiership. One of her first acts was to call in George Osborne, Cameron\u2019s closest friend in politics, and sack him as chancellor in the most humiliating fashion. To this day, Osborne upbraids Cameron: \u201cI told you not to do that fucking referendum.\u201d Cameron says he knows \u201cI failed\u201d.

Kenesha Antoine posted a video on Facebook of her boyfriend, Steven Weber, swimming up to the window of their underwater room at the Manta Resort on Pemba Island, off Tanzania. \u201cI can\u2019t hold my breath long enough to tell you everything I love about you. But everything I love about you I love more every day!\u201d the note reads. In the video, the Louisiana man flips the page to show the message \u201cWill you marry me?\u201d before pulling out an engagement ring box. Antoine posted on Facebook that Weber \u201cnever emerged from those depths\u201d. \u201cYou never got to hear my answer, \u2018Yes! Yes! A million times, yes\u2019. We never got to embrace and celebrate the beginning of the rest of our lives together, as the best day of our lives turned into the worst, in the cruelest twist of fate imaginable. \u201cI will try to take solace in the fact that we enjoyed the most amazing bucket list experiences these past few days, and that we both were so happy and absolutely giddy with excitement in our final moments together.\u201d \u201cWherever in the universe Steven\u2019s spirit now resides \u2026 he\u2019s probably entertaining someone with a story about how he royally screwed up that proposal and died while being extra.\u201d The Manta Resort confirmed in a statement that a guest had died. The chief executive of the resort, Matthew Saus, said: \u201cA male guest tragically drowned while free diving alone outside the underwater room. The accident is currently under investigation by the local Zanzibar police authority. \u201cOur sincerest condolences, thoughts and prayers are with his girlfriend, families and friends impacted by this tragic accident.\u201d US state department reportedly told CNN that a US tourist had died in Tanzania, but gave no further details. \u201cWe offer our sincerest condolences to the family on their loss.

If they were going to find for the government, why bother stringing it out?\u201d Johnson has pledged to abide by the ruling, but Keen refused to rule out that the government might suspend parliament again ahead of the Brexit deadline next month. Whatever the court decides will prove explosive. Lawyers opposing the government have claimed that Johnson\u2019s action was illegal, saying the \u201cexceptionally long\u201d prorogation was intended to \u201csilence\u201d parliament. But Keen, on behalf of the government, submitted that the courts \u201cmust not cross the boundaries and intrude upon the business of parliament\u201d. Sands said the crucial question was what remedy the court would suggest if it did find against the government. Much will rest on the detail in the court\u2019s decision and how it is framed. If the court determines that Johnson misled the Queen, that would make his position untenable, according to Dominic Grieve, the former Conservative attorney general. But the court might choose to frame its verdict around whether Johnson\u2019s decision stymied the passage of legislation through parliament, which is potentially less incendiary. If the court does find against the government, its lawyers will be scrutinising the decision to see if they can go back and order a second prorogation on other grounds. It means that this week\u2019s decision is unlikely to be the end of the matter, whatever the justices decide.",

Cosby Totten, 39, explained how they felt they had to accept abuse from men. \u2018It\u2019s important they think we can take it and give it right back, otherwise we couldn\u2019t survive here.\u2019 Totten herself had left her abusive husband and moved back with her six children to her father\u2019s farm in Appalachia. Unfortunately, \u2018Appalachian social mores insist that a virtuous woman would shrink from working underground in the filthy, dark world that has belonged to men,\u2019 wrote Disney. In 1980, there were 2,500 women miners in the US. \u2018They have survived family disapproval, male ridicule and female resentment, so they feel they are special.\u2019 It\u2019s hard not to disagree when you hear that Cosby once had her ribs broken, but was put back hauling tons of coal the very next night and another woman was back on the night shift six weeks after giving birth. Finally, Disney reminds us of perhaps the biggest peril of the job: \u2018They wear a social security number fashioned in brass, in case an accident destroys them beyond recognition.\u2019",

He\u2019s wearing a secondhand pinstripe jacket and sensible shoes with cushioned soles. Pools of buttercup-yellow light spread from reconditioned railway arches, illuminating the uncreased faces of the Friday-night crew outside, bottles of the finest local microbrew in hand. Music booms. There\u2019s a cavernous bar gilded in red neon with the legend Night Tales. Broad-shouldered bouncers stand sentry, thumbing their phones. The old man shuffles past, aware it\u2019s not for him.</p> <p>I can\u2019t help but feel a little sorry for him. This is because the old man is me. I have come to where the young people are and I feel like David Attenborough in the Galapagos, only with more trepidation and fewer cameras. I know why I am here. I\u2019ve spent the afternoon scanning the menus of restaurants staring you down with starters at \u00a315 and mains at \u00a325 plus and I\u2019m fed up. It feels exclusive. There\u2019s a place for restaurants like that \u2013 expense can be justified. But too many of those menus read like a false promise and I\u2019m not in the mood to believe them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"00472100f4773d4bd8ad98eb4611a19660e04a0d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00472100f4773d4bd8ad98eb4611a19660e04a0d/0_333_5384_3231/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Soft, with an encouraging outer crunch\u2019: slow-cooked pork belly.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Soft, with an encouraging outer crunch\u2019: slow-cooked pork belly.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So here I am, in Hackney, on what will turn out to be the right side of the tracks, looking for good food, fairly priced. Down in one of these arches is the <a href=\"https://www.hackneychurchbrew.co/\" title=\"\">Hackney Church Brew Co</a>, named after the spire across the road. Not long ago they welcomed chef Elliot Cunningham and his semi-permanent pop-up <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/eatlagom/\" title=\"\">Lagom</a>. There is a brewery and next to it a huge red-brick arch of a bar area, the ceiling painted black. The floor is fitted with over-engineered refectory-style tables. Like me, they\u2019re all extremely chunky.</p> <p>You order both drinks and food from the counter, the latter coming from a small, smoky open kitchen just behind. That, in turn, looks out on to an urban garden, which makes a virtue of gravel, strings of glowing bulbs overhead and the business end of air-conditioning units. There are picnic tables. Laden waiters wander about looking for the number sign you were given when you ordered. A couple of whippets snooze on a blanket by the kitchen. Twentysomethings, who have probably abandoned all hope of saving to get on the housing ladder because my generation screwed it all up for them, crowd those tables, choosing instead to spend their money here.</p> <p>If all this sounds uncomfortable and noisy and chaotic to you, then by all means stay away. But just be aware you will be missing out on some bold live-fire cooking that throbs uncompromisingly with flavour. I live for a bit of throbbing flavour, me. And because it comes without fripperies \u2013 who needs linen or chairs or a full table service? \u2013 the price really is decent.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"33f088e949b581bf2094f28bda6e19276bbac04e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33f088e949b581bf2094f28bda6e19276bbac04e/0_433_4476_2686/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Made with featherblade cooked for 12 hours\u2019: beef bun.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Made with featherblade cooked for 12 hours\u2019: beef bun.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Elliot Cunningham is half Swedish and that heritage supplies the word <em>lagom</em>, a term that\u2019s difficult to translate literally, according to the internet. I\u2019m told it means \u201cnot too much and not too little\u201d or thereabouts. That describes the very short, simple food offering. Cunningham says he wants to prove that there\u2019s more to cooking over wood fire than just hunks of meat, though he\u2019s exceptionally good at those. A slab of bone-in pork belly is slow-cooked then rubbed with fermented chilli and the sweet sugary hit of liquid jaggery from the kithul palm, before being allowed to wallow in the gentle heat and smoke of the grill. The result is soft, with an encouraging outer crunch. It is a plate of caramelisation and melting fat. It\u2019s an awful lot of top pig action for \u00a310.</p> <p>Sutton Hoo chicken is given the same long and slow treatment, to produce crisp skin and meat that peels away from the bone without being dry, with the high waft of the smoke it has been embraced lovingly by for hours. Tonight, among the specials, there is a smoked beef bun for \u00a38, made with featherblade cooked for 12 hours, rested then slapped with more fermented chilli.</p> <p>So far, so barbecue. It\u2019s the non-meat dishes that are more striking. Golden beetroot is roasted over the coals until soft, then sliced up into something approximating a carpaccio. Those slices are dressed with a fine acidic emulsion punched up with molasses, along with crushed hazelnuts and torn mint leaves. I\u2019ve eaten an awful lot of beetroot over the past few years. I\u2019ve eaten so much of the red variety I\u2019ve had nights when my pee turned pink. This was the best plate of the stuff I have eaten in years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"990d140490fe5a54b72b37f872accda0b89de4ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/990d140490fe5a54b72b37f872accda0b89de4ed/0_187_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The best plate of the stuff I have eaten in years\u2019: beetroot carpaccio.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The best plate of the stuff I have eaten in years\u2019: beetroot carpaccio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A big serving of closed-cap mushrooms for a fiver are long smoked to an almost meaty intensity and dressed with dollops of boisterous salsa verde; courgettes are grilled and served with chilli, mint and lemon. There is a white coleslaw full of crunch and salt and vinegar, and \u201ccrispy\u201d potatoes the colour of polished gold, with undulations and crevices and curled bits. They aren\u2019t just crisp, they are crispy. Each plate is a simple idea, expressed vividly and with care so that the key ingredient gets to shout its name.</p> <p>There is no dessert on the menu today, but at weekends they serve cherry pie. These have already been made in preparation for the rush. And yes, if I ask nicely, they will pop one in the oven. A note of warning: it is a dish with a sugared pastry crust. If you are livid about this being described as a pie because there isn\u2019t pastry all the way round, please write to your MP. They\u2019ve not got much on at the moment. Beneath that toffeed crust is what happens to fresh cherries cooked down in sugar syrup for a long time. On the side is a gravy boat of double cream. The dish is a tenner, and is designed to serve two, even if one of them is me.</p> <p>I drink wine, because I am that bloke, but it\u2019s called the Hackney Church Brew Co, and they have a fine selection of their own IPAs, pilsners and lagers. I walk out of the service road down the side of these reconditioned railway arches, where the generation below me throng, with a proper spring and jump in my step. I went in a tourist. I came out ready to be a regular.</p> <h2>News bites</h2> <p>Edo in the centre of Belfast also has a smoky, live fire focus to its cooking courtesy of the wood burning Bertha oven at the heart of the kitchen. Much of chef Jonny Elliott\u2019s menu is a robust take on classic tapas: there are croquetas, tortillas and padron peppers. But there are also salt room aged steaks and fish dishes sent for a spin through the intense heat of the apple and pear wood-burning Bertha (<em><a href=\"https://www.edorestaurant.co.uk/\">edorestaurant.co.uk</a></em>).<br><br>Despite a slew of big openings, it\u2019s clear the hospitality business is finding trading tough. The latest casualties are the highly regarded Picture restaurants in London\u2019s Marylebone and Fitzrovia, the second of which I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/aug/20/picture-fitzrovia-london-exceptionally-good-restaurant-review\">reviewed</a> positively in 2017. The owners have announced their closure, saying the business is no longer viable. Happily, they are doing it the right way, closing the restaurants \u2018without leaving anyone out of pocket\u2019.<br><br>Meanwhile in Ilkley, Simon and Rena Gueller have announced they are looking for a buyer for the Box Tree, which they took over in 2004. It opened in 1962 and was an early point of gastronomic pilgrimage for British restaurant goers, becoming one of the very first places in the UK to be awarded two Michelin stars.</p> <p><em>Jay Rayner\u2019s book My Last Supper: One Meal, a Lifetime in the Making is published by Guardian Faber at \u00a316.99, buy it for \u00a311.99 at<a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/my-last-supper-9781783351466.html\" title=\"\">guardianbookshop.com</a></em></p> <p><em>Email Jay at <a href=\"mailto:jay.rayner@observer.co.uk\" title=\"\">jay.rayner@observer.co.uk</a> or follow him on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jayrayner1?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" title=\"\">@jayrayner1</a></em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Lagom at Hackney Church Brew Co, 16-17 Bohemia Place, London E8 1DU (020 8986 2643). Small plates \u00a31.50-\u00a38, large plates \u00a39-\u00a329 (for whole chicken), wines from \u00a325, beers around \u00a35 a pint Down a shadowed road an old man shambles. He\u2019s wearing a secondhand pinstripe jacket and sensible shoes with cushioned soles. Pools of buttercup-yellow light spread from reconditioned railway arches, illuminating the uncreased faces of the Friday-night crew outside, bottles of the finest local microbrew in hand. Music booms. There\u2019s a cavernous bar gilded in red neon with the legend Night Tales. Broad-shouldered bouncers stand sentry, thumbing their phones. The old man shuffles past, aware it\u2019s not for him. I can\u2019t help but feel a little sorry for him. This is because the old man is me. I have come to where the young people are and I feel like David Attenborough in the Galapagos, only with more trepidation and fewer cameras. I know why I am here. I\u2019ve spent the afternoon scanning the menus of restaurants staring you down with starters at \u00a315 and mains at \u00a325 plus and I\u2019m fed up. It feels exclusive. There\u2019s a place for restaurants like that \u2013 expense can be justified. But too many of those menus read like a false promise and I\u2019m not in the mood to believe them. So here I am, in Hackney, on what will turn out to be the right side of the tracks, looking for good food, fairly priced. Down in one of these arches is the Hackney Church Brew Co, named after the spire across the road. Not long ago they welcomed chef Elliot Cunningham and his semi-permanent pop-up Lagom. There is a brewery and next to it a huge red-brick arch of a bar area, the ceiling painted black. The floor is fitted with over-engineered refectory-style tables. Like me, they\u2019re all extremely chunky. You order both drinks and food from the counter, the latter coming from a small, smoky open kitchen just behind. That, in turn, looks out on to an urban garden, which makes a virtue of gravel, strings of glowing bulbs overhead and the business end of air-conditioning units. There are picnic tables. Laden waiters wander about looking for the number sign you were given when you ordered. A couple of whippets snooze on a blanket by the kitchen. Twentysomethings, who have probably abandoned all hope of saving to get on the housing ladder because my generation screwed it all up for them, crowd those tables, choosing instead to spend their money here. If all this sounds uncomfortable and noisy and chaotic to you, then by all means stay away. But just be aware you will be missing out on some bold live-fire cooking that throbs uncompromisingly with flavour. I live for a bit of throbbing flavour, me. And because it comes without fripperies \u2013 who needs linen or chairs or a full table service? \u2013 the price really is decent. Elliot Cunningham is half Swedish and that heritage supplies the word lagom, a term that\u2019s difficult to translate literally, according to the internet. I\u2019m told it means \u201cnot too much and not too little\u201d or thereabouts. That describes the very short, simple food offering. Cunningham says he wants to prove that there\u2019s more to cooking over wood fire than just hunks of meat, though he\u2019s exceptionally good at those. A slab of bone-in pork belly is slow-cooked then rubbed with fermented chilli and the sweet sugary hit of liquid jaggery from the kithul palm, before being allowed to wallow in the gentle heat and smoke of the grill. The result is soft, with an encouraging outer crunch. It is a plate of caramelisation and melting fat. It\u2019s an awful lot of top pig action for \u00a310. Sutton Hoo chicken is given the same long and slow treatment, to produce crisp skin and meat that peels away from the bone without being dry, with the high waft of the smoke it has been embraced lovingly by for hours. Tonight, among the specials, there is a smoked beef bun for \u00a38, made with featherblade cooked for 12 hours, rested then slapped with more fermented chilli. So far, so barbecue. It\u2019s the non-meat dishes that are more striking. Golden beetroot is roasted over the coals until soft, then sliced up into something approximating a carpaccio. Those slices are dressed with a fine acidic emulsion punched up with molasses, along with crushed hazelnuts and torn mint leaves. I\u2019ve eaten an awful lot of beetroot over the past few years. I\u2019ve eaten so much of the red variety I\u2019ve had nights when my pee turned pink. This was the best plate of the stuff I have eaten in years. A big serving of closed-cap mushrooms for a fiver are long smoked to an almost meaty intensity and dressed with dollops of boisterous salsa verde; courgettes are grilled and served with chilli, mint and lemon. There is a white coleslaw full of crunch and salt and vinegar, and \u201ccrispy\u201d potatoes the colour of polished gold, with undulations and crevices and curled bits. They aren\u2019t just crisp, they are crispy. Each plate is a simple idea, expressed vividly and with care so that the key ingredient gets to shout its name. There is no dessert on the menu today, but at weekends they serve cherry pie. These have already been made in preparation for the rush. And yes, if I ask nicely, they will pop one in the oven. A note of warning: it is a dish with a sugared pastry crust. If you are livid about this being described as a pie because there isn\u2019t pastry all the way round, please write to your MP. They\u2019ve not got much on at the moment. Beneath that toffeed crust is what happens to fresh cherries cooked down in sugar syrup for a long time. On the side is a gravy boat of double cream. The dish is a tenner, and is designed to serve two, even if one of them is me. I drink wine, because I am that bloke, but it\u2019s called the Hackney Church Brew Co, and they have a fine selection of their own IPAs, pilsners and lagers. I walk out of the service road down the side of these reconditioned railway arches, where the generation below me throng, with a proper spring and jump in my step. I went in a tourist. I came out ready to be a regular. News bites Edo in the centre of Belfast also has a smoky, live fire focus to its cooking courtesy of the wood burning Bertha oven at the heart of the kitchen. Much of chef Jonny Elliott\u2019s menu is a robust take on classic tapas: there are croquetas, tortillas and padron peppers. But there are also salt room aged steaks and fish dishes sent for a spin through the intense heat of the apple and pear wood-burning Bertha (edorestaurant.co.uk). Despite a slew of big openings, it\u2019s clear the hospitality business is finding trading tough. The latest casualties are the highly regarded Picture restaurants in London\u2019s Marylebone and Fitzrovia, the second of which I reviewed positively in 2017. The owners have announced their closure, saying the business is no longer viable. Happily, they are doing it the right way, closing the restaurants \u2018without leaving anyone out of pocket\u2019. Meanwhile in Ilkley, Simon and Rena Gueller have announced they are looking for a buyer for the Box Tree, which they took over in 2004. It opened in 1962 and was an early point of gastronomic pilgrimage for British restaurant goers, becoming one of the very first places in the UK to be awarded two Michelin stars.

For many drivers, that licence was granted a while ago \u2013 and some bad habits may have developed since. The team at <a href=\"https://www.carshop.co.uk/latest-news/\">CarShop</a>, has revealed some of driving habits you probably didn\u2019t know were damaging to your car. Take note and try and avoid them \u2013 your car will thank you in the end.</p> <p><strong>1. Flooring the accelerator in a high gear. </strong>Many cars have a gear-shift indicator that suggests when to change gears. However, this indicator is usually based on the assumption that you\u2019ll be cruising at the same speed, and isn\u2019t always accurate if you\u2019re continuing to accelerate. If you find you\u2019re having to floor the accelerator in a high gear, you should shift down a gear for more power. Flooring the accelerator in a high gear means your engine is working extremely hard, which puts a lot of strain on your motor.</p> <p><strong>2. Overloading your car.</strong> While this may seem obvious, you might not realise how easy it is to overload your car. If you\u2019ve got four passengers and luggage, it\u2019s likely your car is already overloaded. Overloading your car puts strain on your brakes, drivetrain and suspension. It can result in you having less control of your vehicle, and may also lead to costly repairs.</p> <p><strong>3. Resting your hand on the gear stick.</strong> In short, your gear stick is attached to what\u2019s called a \u201cselector fork\u201d inside your transmission, which makes contact with rotating metal components every time you select a gear. However, when you rest your hand on the gear stick, this pressure may force the selector fork into the rotating components for a prolonged period, when you\u2019re not even changing gear, causing it to wear out much more quickly than it usually would.</p> <p><strong>4. Riding the clutch. </strong>This refers to keeping your clutch partially pressed in. You\u2019re most likely to do this when you\u2019re in a queue of traffic, when you\u2019re gently pressing and releasing the clutch to creep forward and stop rather than braking. The reason this is bad for your car is that it causes unnecessary friction between the clutch plate and flywheel, which could lead your clutch kit to an early grave, resulting in some costly repair fees.</p> <p><strong>5. Shifting into reverse before stopping. </strong>In manual cars, if you put your car into reverse whilst still moving slightly forward, you will have to use the clutch more for your car to begin reversing - which adds more wear to your clutch and drivetrain. However, this is an even bigger problem in automatic cars, as it\u2019s problematic for the transmission and will wear the transmission band considerably more.</p> <p><strong>6. Driving your car before it\u2019s warmed up. </strong>You shouldn\u2019t turn on your car and immediately drive as it won\u2019t have warmed up properly. This only takes a few seconds in modern cars, but in older cars this can take much longer. Once you turn your car on, you should watch your RPM gauge - your car will run at a high idle before dropping down to a lower RPM. Only after your RPM has dropped should you set off, as this means the oil has had time to properly lubricate the components in your car.</p> <p><strong>7. Keeping the clutch depressed when stationary. </strong>Many drivers will wait at a traffic light with first gear engaged and the clutch depressed, but this is causing unnecessary wear on your clutch. When you don\u2019t need to use the clutch pedal, don\u2019t. It\u2019s much better to put your car in neutral and use your handbrake while you\u2019re stationary.</p> <p><strong>8. Braking just before a speed bump. </strong>When you apply your brakes your car nosedives and compresses the struts in your car. While doing this, if you go over a speedbump, you run a high risk of the underside of your car grazing the bump. The bump also forces your wheels upwards which further compresses your struts, adding unnecessary strain. Adjust your speed well before approaching a speed bump to avoid this.</p> <p><strong>9. Forgetting oil changes. </strong>Not changing your oil regularly has a large impact on your engine as old oil becomes less and less efficient when it comes to lubricating its components. It\u2019s recommended that oil, along with the oil filter, is changed every 3-6 months.</p> <p><strong>10. Forgetting to check tyre pressure. </strong>You should regularly check the pressure of your tyres. Over-inflated tyres decrease contact with road surface, which severely reduces control and handling. Under-inflated tyres cause too much friction and leave you at risk of your tyres popping or \u201cblowing out\u201d, which could cause a severe accident.</p> <p><em>Email Martin at <a href=\"mailto:martin.love@observer.co.uk\" title=\"\">martin.love@observer.co.uk</a> or follow him on Twitter<a href=\"https://twitter.com/martinlove166\" title=\"\">@MartinLove166</a></em></p>",

Feeling delicate makes me regress to childhood comforts and wary of anything adventurous, so I pick up bars saying familiar things: milk, nuts, vanilla. I choose three bars, one by Dolfin, exquisitely, if excessively packaged in a foldover loose-tobacco-style wallet. The orange wrapper of the Nougat et Miel appeals and it is good - but the bits in it aren\u2019t bold enough and the overall experience too sweet (38% cocoa, but still with sugar in protagonist role). The real surprise and delight is discovering Oxford-based Linden Chocolate Lab, run by a couple who are PhD students. My husband coerces me into trying the Pink Pepper 80% (\u00a35.75/85g), and it\u2019s delicate and delicious. But the Super Silky Milk is where things start happening. The kick of the masterly 67% cocoa reveals itself slowly and gently, like sitting next to an initially unassuming person at a dinner party who, in time, you realise has it all going on. And you end the evening transfixed and more than a little in love. lindenchocolatelab.com",

      "bodyText": "Eighteen years after the towers fell and the Pentagon burned, nearly three in four Americans call terror a national priority. Almost half prioritize security over civil liberties. Should Edward Snowden be prosecuted? The public is divided. To most, the man responsible for a historic leak of US surveillance efforts is not wholly hero or villain. Our perceptions are shaded in grey. Against this backdrop comes Permanent Record, a well-written, self-absolving, brazen autobiography. For someone who by his own account had no interest in writing a 1,000-word personal statement in high school, Snowden delivers an easy read, part confession, part J\u2019accuse. It is another book for our times. Amid accusations by the attorney general, William Barr, that the government spied on Donald Trump\u2019s campaign, it is worth remembering Barr has been described as \u201cthe godfather of the NSA\u2019s bulk data collection program\u201d. Ambivalence and hypocrisy reign. On both sides. Snowden is generous with facts \u2013 to a point. He lets us into his childhood as the son of a coast guard officer, the grandson of a coast guard admiral. He tells of his Puritan ancestry, his early fascination with computer games, his tropism toward defiance, a knack for \u201chacking\u201d that became obvious early. He hated being made to go to bed early, and recalls resetting clocks to confuse the powers that be. It was downhill from there. By the time Snowden reached high school it was apparent he was not college-bound, if not for lack of smarts. He has an IQ of 145.

It is not correct to suggest that we are focusing on the fight to save our pension scheme at the expense of seeking better working conditions and more secure contracts for university staff, especially junior staff. In fact, UCU and its predecessor unions have campaigned against the casualisation of higher education for more than three decades.

I appreciate that, as a new leader, she wants to appear strong and unambiguous about this divisive issue and her desire to be prime minister by the end of the year is perhaps more of a dream sequence than reality. Yes, as Rawnsley states, she will be a wild card for this election, but for the party to \u201cgo rogue\u201d at this stage might alienate sympathisers of their core, democratic beliefs, who always felt that they were the moderate and ethical players on the political scene and may now render many floating voters politically homeless.<br><strong>Judith A Daniels</strong><br>Great Yarmouth, Norfolk<br></p> <h2>A taste of old China<br></h2> <p>Reading <em>Observer Food Monthly</em> just before Sunday lunch with a glass of chilled white rioja is a favourite monthly ritual.

Martin Ward Scole, Diss, Norfolk Of boyfriends and windbags Nick Cohen (\u201cTo see how extremism has taken root in Britain, just look at Islington\u201d, Comment) provides a useful analysis of just the kind of incorrigible poseur who once stole Harriet Sherwood\u2019s heart (\u201cHow did my far left ex-boyfriend swing so far that he\u2019s now in Farage\u2019s party?\u201d, Focus). To me, Alaric Bamping is a narcissistic attention-seeker whose \u201clook how unorthodox I am\u201d shtick keeps him permanently on the outside pissing in. One is reminded of Tony Hancock in one of his windbaggier moments. Unfortunately, these professional contrarians are hogging more and more media time at the expense of more moderate voices. Jim Trimmer Kingston upon Thames Has Swinson gone too far? I read Andrew Rawnsley\u2019s column with interest and he will now know that Jo Swinson\u2019s gamble of revoking article 50 on day one received a resounding thumbs-up from the party faithful (\u201cAgainst very familiar rivals, Jo Swinson will be the wild card of the election\u201d, Comment). But like many others, including Norman Lamb, I am decidedly uneasy about this pledge and she may be going for broke in a kamikaze fashion. It appears autocratic and undemocratic and goes against the Lib Dems\u2019 fair-minded ethos. I appreciate that, as a new leader, she wants to appear strong and unambiguous about this divisive issue and her desire to be prime minister by the end of the year is perhaps more of a dream sequence than reality. Yes, as Rawnsley states, she will be a wild card for this election, but for the party to \u201cgo rogue\u201d at this stage might alienate sympathisers of their core, democratic beliefs, who always felt that they were the moderate and ethical players on the political scene and may now render many floating voters politically homeless. Judith A Daniels Great Yarmouth, Norfolk A taste of old China Reading Observer Food Monthly just before Sunday lunch with a glass of chilled white rioja is a favourite monthly ritual. But I must take issue with the article on Chinese food and cooking in Britain (\u201cThe UK\u2019s Chinese food revolution\u201d). No recognition of Chinese regional cuisines in pre-2000 Britain? A shortage of Cantonese chefs and cooking in today\u2019s Britain? Fuchsia Dunlop ignores such a classic and beautiful offering as Margaret Leeming and May Huang Man-hui\u2019s Chinese Regional Cooking (1983), in which recipes are offered from all over China, 30 pages from the south-west alone. North Chinese cuisine was widely renowned in the 1980s in Britain, even \u201cup north\u201d in the Leeds Chinese community. As for southern cooking, the existence of thousands of Cantonese-led family-owned restaurants across Britain should remind her that this culinary tradition lives on strongly.

      "body": "<p>Britain is gripped by political crisis. We have a prime minister bent on taking Britain out of the EU in just over a month, even if it means crashing out with no deal, with dreadful consequences for jobs and growth, for regional inequalities and for the union. Lacking any democratic mandate, Boris Johnson has shut down parliament for five weeks in an attempt to stop MPs from blocking him, a move whose legality the supreme court will rule on this week. Yet the Labour party is heading into its conference this weekend riven by splits over Brexit and sectarian attempts by Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s allies to scrap the position of deputy leader.</p> <p>It represents a breathtaking failure of leadership by Corbyn. Never has Britain been in such desperate need of a leader of the opposition who can take on a prime minister who appears prepared to ride roughshod over the rule of law and who has shown such rank disregard for our democratically elected representatives. Yet Labour seems determined to show voters that it, too, is a hopelessly divided party that cannot reach consensus on its internal party structures, let alone a clear position on Brexit or a vision for the country.</p> <p>Following an overwhelming backlash, a motion to abolish the position of Labour deputy leader, currently held by Tom Watson, was hastily withdrawn. But the damage is done. Corbyn looks like a leader more interested in quelling internal dissent than winning a general election. It is yet another sign that, like the Conservatives, Labour is cementing its move towards the political fringe, unable to accommodate a broad church of perspectives that includes a lifelong social democrat such as Watson, who was directly elected by Labour members and can legitimately claim to speak for many in his criticisms of the leadership over Brexit and its abject failure to tackle the antisemitism in its ranks.</p> <p>Labour will pay the price at the polls. Despite <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/boris-johnson-less-popular-theresa-18814166\" title=\"\">Johnson\u2019s relative unpopularity</a>, <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/political-parties/labour-party/jeremy-corbyn/news/106687/jeremy-corbyn-most-unpopular\" title=\"\">Corbyn lags far behind</a>. New polling for the <em>Observer</em> this weekend puts the Tories 15 points ahead of Labour.

      "bodyText": "Britain is gripped by political crisis. We have a prime minister bent on taking Britain out of the EU in just over a month, even if it means crashing out with no deal, with dreadful consequences for jobs and growth, for regional inequalities and for the union. Lacking any democratic mandate, Boris Johnson has shut down parliament for five weeks in an attempt to stop MPs from blocking him, a move whose legality the supreme court will rule on this week. Yet the Labour party is heading into its conference this weekend riven by splits over Brexit and sectarian attempts by Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s allies to scrap the position of deputy leader. It represents a breathtaking failure of leadership by Corbyn. Never has Britain been in such desperate need of a leader of the opposition who can take on a prime minister who appears prepared to ride roughshod over the rule of law and who has shown such rank disregard for our democratically elected representatives. Yet Labour seems determined to show voters that it, too, is a hopelessly divided party that cannot reach consensus on its internal party structures, let alone a clear position on Brexit or a vision for the country. Following an overwhelming backlash, a motion to abolish the position of Labour deputy leader, currently held by Tom Watson, was hastily withdrawn. But the damage is done. Corbyn looks like a leader more interested in quelling internal dissent than winning a general election. It is yet another sign that, like the Conservatives, Labour is cementing its move towards the political fringe, unable to accommodate a broad church of perspectives that includes a lifelong social democrat such as Watson, who was directly elected by Labour members and can legitimately claim to speak for many in his criticisms of the leadership over Brexit and its abject failure to tackle the antisemitism in its ranks. Labour will pay the price at the polls. Despite Johnson\u2019s relative unpopularity, Corbyn lags far behind. New polling for the Observer this weekend puts the Tories 15 points ahead of Labour. Labour\u2019s unclear Brexit position is undoubtedly part of the explanation: for the first time, of those who voted Remain in 2016, as many say they would vote Liberal Democrat as Labour.

As he hacked along the slippery chalk trail, he decided to create a lightweight, all-adventure bike that would put foul-weather capability first. His thinking was that a bike that \u2018thrives in winter will survive summer, however a bike that thrives in summer will die in winter\u2019. The main zone of conflict between an off-roader and a pool of gloopy mud, is the gear mechanism. The sprockets get clogged with dirt and grime. For this reason, rather than fitting exposed traditional derailleurs, he chose to fit enclosed, reliable, weather-beating Pinion gearboxes linked to super-durable Gates Carbondrive CDX belts. His early bike models were named after some of his favourite pubs from along the South Downs Way \u2013 the Lamb, the Ram and the Swan.

      "bodyText": "Olsen Cycles Price frames from \u00a31,700, olsenbicycles.com During a heroic one-day attempt to cycle the length of the beautiful South Downs Way between Winchester, the first capital of England, and the white cliffs of Eastbourne, Steve Olsen had a eureka moment. As he hacked along the slippery chalk trail, he decided to create a lightweight, all-adventure bike that would put foul-weather capability first. His thinking was that a bike that \u2018thrives in winter will survive summer, however a bike that thrives in summer will die in winter\u2019. The main zone of conflict between an off-roader and a pool of gloopy mud, is the gear mechanism. The sprockets get clogged with dirt and grime. For this reason, rather than fitting exposed traditional derailleurs, he chose to fit enclosed, reliable, weather-beating Pinion gearboxes linked to super-durable Gates Carbondrive CDX belts. His early bike models were named after some of his favourite pubs from along the South Downs Way \u2013 the Lamb, the Ram and the Swan. Since then he has created three new models with differing geometry to suit the style of riding you do, with rather less poetic names \u2013 the N1, N2 and N3.

The ship held enslaved Africans, and 20 or 30 of them were bought by Virginians. The people who bought them were not yet fully American; America was still a colony of Britain. In the opening programme, Hannah-Jones, gradually, skilfully, tells us the tale of American independence, and how black people became the citizens who fought for true democracy. She points out the contradiction baked into the original American constitution: a horrible compromise born of the fact that, though it spoke of how all men were created equal, it neglected to mention that slavery existed. In fact, Abraham Lincoln, in 1862, invited five black men to the White House and said that he was minded to end slavery, but that if he was to do this, did they think that the newly freed black people <a href=\"https://prologue.blogs.archives.gov/2010/12/01/lincoln-to-slaves-go-somewhere-else/\" title=\"\">would mind if they were shipped to another country</a>?</p> <p>Hannah-Jones is a warm, intelligent presenter, who weaves her own family history through this podcast. So far we\u2019ve learned about the fight for democracy, the economy, the birth of American music and the US health system. All viewed through the lens of black experience.

      "bodyText": "Scott Morrison insists Australia will not be drawn into any military conflict with Iran, declaring our commitment is limited to protecting freedom of navigation in the Strait of Hormuz. Donald Trump, who flagged the prospect of a military strike against Iran, including, possibly, with nuclear weapons, during a meeting with Morrison in the Oval Office, before backtracking and saying his preference was for restraint \u2013 has sent additional troops and enhanced air and missile defence systems to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in response to a drone attack on Saudi oil facilities on 14 September. Trump is expected to use the looming opportunity of leaders week at the United Nations to try to cajole other nations into participation. Trump is scheduled to meet at least a dozen world leaders during his three days in New York. Morrison told travelling reporters after a reception at the private residence of Australia\u2019s ambassador to Washington that Australia was engaged in the Strait of Hormuz and \u201cthat\u2019s where our involvement is\u201d. \u201cThere was no discussion about anything else. There was an appreciation of our involvement in that particular operation, which I remind everyone is about freedom of navigation in the Straits of Hormuz,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cThat\u2019s what that is about. The other matters that are being pursued by the United States are matters that they\u2019re pursuing, and I made it very clear when we announced our involvement in [the Strait of Hormuz] that it was very much about that freedom of navigation issue and that\u2019s what it is about and that\u2019s appreciated.\u201d Morrison said he had discussed arrangements for the freedom of navigation exercise with the US defence secretary, Mark Esper during his meetings with members of the Trump cabinet on Friday Washington time. Morrison praised Trump\u2019s restraint on Iran. \u201cI made a point of commending the president yesterday on what I understand to be his natural instinct of restraint on these matters and he said that I think fairly plainly yesterday in the Oval Office I think there is an instinct towards restraint from the president and I commended him for that, and it was good to have the opportunity to confirm that again in the course of our discussions. \u201cI mean Australia will make its decisions in our national interest. I said at the press conference yesterday that where we\u2019ve worked together it\u2019s because we have shared objectives,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cIt\u2019s not because [America] asks us to do this, or we ask them to do that, it\u2019s because we share objectives and where those objectives are shared then you can expect an alignment of activities and operations.\u201d Morrison said people needed to avoid \u201cgetting ahead of themselves\u201d about what Trump might or might not do in relation to Iran. He said these issues were \u201cdealt with I think in a very iterative way and I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing\u201d. Trump told reporters during his meeting with Morrison that he could launch a military strike on Iran \u201cright here\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s all set to go. I could do it right here and then you\u2019d have a nice big story to report,\u201d the president declared. But moments later he suggested holding off was the better course of action. \u201cI think the strong person\u2019s approach, and the thing that does show strength, would be showing a little bit of restraint.\u201d Morrison wound up his Washington program on Saturday local time with a $150m commitment to support Nasa in launching expeditions to the moon and to Mars, and with a visit to a centre helping veterans to become entrepreneurs. He then attended a soiree at the ambassadorial residence with Trump administration officials and Australian business figures including Gina Rinehart, Anthony Pratt and Kerry Stokes. Morrison will travel with Trump to Ohio on Sunday local time to open a box factory owned by Pratt, the Australian billionaire box maker. That event will also be a campaign rally for Trump. The prime minister will then fly on to Chicago, where he will give a keynote speech, before heading to New York and the United Nations.",
