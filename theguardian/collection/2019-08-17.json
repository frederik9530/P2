After all, six of the top eight in betting lists are from Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s stable and there must be every chance that half of those will drop out.

He devoted one section to \u201cclimate risk\u201d, in which he told the audience of risk managers \u201cto take appropriate account of one risk that plays out over a longer horizon, namely climate risk.\u201d</p> <p>He also advised that \u201cclimate is a challenging risk to assess but an increasingly necessary one. Businesses need to take account of both the physical risks and the transition risks\u201d.</p> <p>He referenced <a href=\"http://v\">information released this week</a> by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, which noted its regulatory guidance for company directors was to \u201cadopt a probative and proactive approach to emerging risks, including climate risk\u201d and \u201cdisclose meaningful and useful climate risk related information to investors\u201d.</p> <p>Such bodies don\u2019t do these things for laughs or to please the greenies. They do it because they know climate change is real and that companies that ignore it could be held liable in the future.</p> <p>It is why reinsurers (companies that underwrite insurance firms) very much take climate change into account. Earlier this year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/21/climate-change-could-make-insurance-too-expensive-for-ordinary-people-report\">the world\u2019s largest reinsurer, Munich Re</a>, warned that the cost of insurance in areas likely to be affected by the impact of climate change \u2013 whether it be flooding, bushfire or increased hurricanes and cyclones \u2013 would cause them to have to increase their risk prices, which in turn could mean that \u201csome people on low and average incomes in some regions will no longer be able to buy insurance\u201d.</p> <p>I can understand the government wanting to reassure people that there is still coral to see on the reef. But let\u2019s not treat those same people like idiots.</p> <p>Major businesses and institutions know the science is real and are acting accordingly. The people who live in the Pacific islands know only too well the reality of the science.</p> <p>And yet our government, hand-in-hand with the editorial policies of major conservative media, remains wilfully ignorant.</p> <p>After more than a decade we may expect such ignorance, but we must never accept it.</p> <p>\u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 19 August to clarify that Gay Debelle gave the speech at the 14th Annual Risk Australia conference. </p>",

If we are to secure a future for the Great Barrier Reef and coral reef ecosystems globally, there is an urgent and critical need to accelerate actions to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d At the same time this week, the prime minister was in Tuvalu at the Pacific Island Forum, doing all he could to ensure the issue of climate change was being fobbed off \u2013 by reportedly trying (and failing) to remove mention of climate change \u201ccrisis\u201d and also removing mention of coal in the forum communiqu\u00e9. Perhaps this should not surprise us, but that does not mean we should accept it with a shrug. For just as Alan Jones\u2019s vile misogyny, ignorance and lies on climate change , also on display this week, should not go uncriticised (even though we expect no better from him), we must continue to push for our government to acknowledge reality and then work to do something about it. Because while our conservative media and government is ignoring the issue, our major institutions are not. This week the deputy governor of the Reserve Bank, Guy Debelle, gave a speech specifically about risks to the economy at the 14th Annual Risk Australia conference. He devoted one section to \u201cclimate risk\u201d, in which he told the audience of risk managers \u201cto take appropriate account of one risk that plays out over a longer horizon, namely climate risk.\u201d He also advised that \u201cclimate is a challenging risk to assess but an increasingly necessary one. Businesses need to take account of both the physical risks and the transition risks\u201d. He referenced information released this week by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, which noted its regulatory guidance for company directors was to \u201cadopt a probative and proactive approach to emerging risks, including climate risk\u201d and \u201cdisclose meaningful and useful climate risk related information to investors\u201d. Such bodies don\u2019t do these things for laughs or to please the greenies. They do it because they know climate change is real and that companies that ignore it could be held liable in the future. It is why reinsurers (companies that underwrite insurance firms) very much take climate change into account. Earlier this year the world\u2019s largest reinsurer, Munich Re, warned that the cost of insurance in areas likely to be affected by the impact of climate change \u2013 whether it be flooding, bushfire or increased hurricanes and cyclones \u2013 would cause them to have to increase their risk prices, which in turn could mean that \u201csome people on low and average incomes in some regions will no longer be able to buy insurance\u201d. I can understand the government wanting to reassure people that there is still coral to see on the reef. But let\u2019s not treat those same people like idiots. Major businesses and institutions know the science is real and are acting accordingly. The people who live in the Pacific islands know only too well the reality of the science. And yet our government, hand-in-hand with the editorial policies of major conservative media, remains wilfully ignorant. After more than a decade we may expect such ignorance, but we must never accept it. \u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia \u2022 This article was amended on 19 August to clarify that Gay Debelle gave the speech at the 14th Annual Risk Australia conference.",

More than 300 writers gathered for two days of workshops on topics from how to negotiate a contract to how to choreograph a fight scene.</p> <p>For years this conference could not attract anyone from the Australian industry to attend. Now Australian publishers are cashing in.</p> <p>\u201cWe were portrayed in the media as a joke,\u201d says author Anne Gracie, opening the conference. \u201cA bunch of frustrated housewives churning out trash to a formula.\u201d</p> <p>Gracie is a best-selling writer of historical romances set in the Regency era. When she first signed with Mills and Boon in 1999, she says, Australian writers were forced by disinterested local publishers to go overseas: to Mills and Boon in London and to Berkley, the PRH imprint that publishes Gracie, Singh and many other big romance authors in the US.</p> <p>In pushing romance aside, the Australian literary scene unwittingly caused many romance writers to find<strong> </strong>commercial success abroad.

Authors of genre fiction, including romance, were among the top earners: 13% earned more than $101,000 in the year the survey was conducted.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s always been a potential income,\u201d Gracie says. \u201cIf you can crack the Mills and Boon market, in particular.\u201d</p> <p>There are currently 75 Mills and Boon authors based in Australia and New Zealand. The publisher sells one book every 1.2 seconds globally. If writers can keep a regular pace \u2013 some like Australian Clare Connelly are writing one 40,000 word book a month \u2013 it\u2019s a middle-class existence.</p> <p>That it is carved by writing books that often feature explicit sex scenes is beside the point.

Then her Riley Jenson Guardian Series, an urban fantasy about werewolf-vampire hybrids, became a New York Times bestseller.</p> <p>She sold it to a US publisher after trying for several years to get it picked up in Australia.

      "bodyText": "Nalini Singh is trying to convince me to read a love story starring bears. The tiny author is tucked up under a huge scarf in a cafe on a freezing August day in Melbourne. The bear in question is Valentin Nikolaev, the Russian alpha of the StoneWater changeling bear clan and hero of her 41st book, Silver Silence. It\u2019s a continuation of Singh\u2019s immensely popular Psy/Changeling series, set in a dystopian future where Psy, human and Changeling forces battle for control of the world. In the past 16 years the 41-year-old New Zealander has written 43 books, not counting novellas, and sold more than 7 million copies worldwide. She is, by any measure, a success. She is not alone. In the conference rooms above us sit dozens of Australia\u2019s most successful authors. They are New York Times bestsellers and Amazon chart-toppers; women who make a comfortable living writing for traditional publishers, and others who make six-figure salaries through self-publishing. Yet to the broader Australian literary community, these women \u2013 and they are overwhelmingly women \u2013 are mostly unknown, their success either ignored or dismissed. It is the 28th annual conference of the romance writers of Australia. More than 300 writers gathered for two days of workshops on topics from how to negotiate a contract to how to choreograph a fight scene. For years this conference could not attract anyone from the Australian industry to attend. Now Australian publishers are cashing in. \u201cWe were portrayed in the media as a joke,\u201d says author Anne Gracie, opening the conference. \u201cA bunch of frustrated housewives churning out trash to a formula.\u201d Gracie is a best-selling writer of historical romances set in the Regency era. When she first signed with Mills and Boon in 1999, she says, Australian writers were forced by disinterested local publishers to go overseas: to Mills and Boon in London and to Berkley, the PRH imprint that publishes Gracie, Singh and many other big romance authors in the US. In pushing romance aside, the Australian literary scene unwittingly caused many romance writers to find commercial success abroad. Gracie recalls being told 10 years ago that only 12 people in Australia could earn a living from writing fiction. \u201cThat\u2019s funny, because every month in Melbourne I have lunch with about 16 of those 12 and right now I\u2019m here with about 30 or 35 more of those 12, who earn a living,\u201d she says. A 2015 survey of the Australian book industry found that the average amount earned by Australian authors for their creative works each year was $12,900. Authors of genre fiction, including romance, were among the top earners: 13% earned more than $101,000 in the year the survey was conducted. \u201cIt\u2019s always been a potential income,\u201d Gracie says. \u201cIf you can crack the Mills and Boon market, in particular.\u201d There are currently 75 Mills and Boon authors based in Australia and New Zealand. The publisher sells one book every 1.2 seconds globally. If writers can keep a regular pace \u2013 some like Australian Clare Connelly are writing one 40,000 word book a month \u2013 it\u2019s a middle-class existence. That it is carved by writing books that often feature explicit sex scenes is beside the point. Sex scenes, says Gracie, are difficult. It takes skill to do them well. \u201cThere\u2019s an awful lot of writers where I go, \u2018Oh, a sex scene\u2019,\u201d she says, and mimes skipping pages. \u201cBecause it\u2019s just story, bonking, story, it doesn\u2019t work. But there are some writers whose sex scenes further the characterisation and further the story, and that\u2019s what I want mine to do.\u201d Keri Arthur wrote her first few books around working split shifts as a chef, until the stress of those long hours put her in hospital. Then her Riley Jenson Guardian Series, an urban fantasy about werewolf-vampire hybrids, became a New York Times bestseller. She sold it to a US publisher after trying for several years to get it picked up in Australia. It was a blessing in disguise: if she had been picked up by a receptive local publisher, she says, she would still be donning chef\u2019s whites. \u201cThe money difference is huge. I can actually survive with what I was earning in America; I couldn\u2019t survive in Australian publishing.\u201d Three years ago, after losing her contract, Arthur turned to self-publishing. Her 48th book is due out in October. Self-publishing has facilitated financial success for many writers of romance and other genre fiction, allowing them to earn up to 15 times more per book. Perth-based Michelle Diener publishes her own historical and science fiction romances and has produced 16 books since 2011. \u201cI\u2019m making the best money I have ever made in my life,\u201d she says. Sarah Williams uses her ability to manage the business of self-publishing to support other authors. She now makes about 60% of her income from her own self-published rural romance novels, and 40% from her small press, Serenade Publishing. Serenade\u2019s submission guidelines are an effective summary of the genre: split point-of-view, classic romance tropes and a happily ever after. The genre is overwhelmingly white and straight but publishers are now asking for diverse voices. After Singh\u2019s first paranormal romance was published, she received letters from readers who were overjoyed to see a brown heroine in a genre traditionally dominated by white protagonists. \u201cThat was the only point I realised, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve done something different\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s my natural way of writing: I write diverse worlds, because I live in a diverse world and that\u2019s what comes out when I sit down to write.\u201d Some tropes \u2013 like alpha heroes, surmountable obstacles and happy endings \u2013 remain. \u201cIf you write a genre book you\u2019re making a promise to the reader,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think of that as a commercial way of thinking, I simply think that this is the genre I choose to write in and I have to respect that genre.\u201d The romance industry has been accused of shutting out non-white authors but London-born author MV Ellis, who received six offers for her first book, says that mainstream non-white romance sells well. \u201cThere\u2019s a misconception that if you read a book by an author who is not white you\u2019re going to have to do some kind of work,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can be not-white and write a book that\u2019s quite fluffy and have characters who are not white or not straight and not able-bodied \u2013 and those books [can] still give readers the same feeling and the same experience as books that don\u2019t have diverse characters.\u201d The conference program, like the genre itself, is a mixture of fun and business.

It\u2019s where the police used to take people \u2013 almost always Aboriginal \u2013 who they\u2019d picked up for hitting the grog too hard.</p> <p>When I first arrived in the Northern Territory, the Alcohol Mandatory Treatment Tribunal was still up and running. It operated on the outdated belief that you can coerce someone out of addiction by forcing them into involuntary residential treatment. You\u2019d be unlikely to find yourself here unless you were an Aboriginal person who\u2019d been drinking in a public place \u2013 maybe in the Todd River or somewhere about town. If you were picked up by police three times in two months they could bring you in. You\u2019d be given a mattress on the floor and could wait for more than a week before a lawyer came and saw you.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/nov/12/nt-admits-paperless-arrest-laws-misused-in-aboriginal-death-in-custody-case\">A man died a few years ago</a> after being picked up by the police for drinking in a public place \u2013 not here in Alice Springs but up in Darwin. The police found him sitting under a tree. He had a sick heart. He\u2019d been in hospital just days before. He didn\u2019t want to go with police but they took him in anyway. They put him in a cell and he died there.</p> <p>That man was picked up under different laws than the ones that used to see folks dumped in this in-between place \u2013 but they\u2019re close enough. These laws were written for the same reason as we build these in-between places down long roads, and away from town centres; to pull them \u201cout of circulation\u201d (<a href=\"http://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/IndigLawB/2015/49.pdf\">as the NT attorney general said in 2014</a>).</p> <p>If we keep driving a little further you can see the prison watchtower on our right. For the most part the prison is a kind of purgatory. It\u2019s another in-between place. Hundreds of the folks in the big house have been charged with offences but have not been found guilty. They spend their summer days sweltering in almost 50C heat without air conditioning and in overcrowded dorms, waiting to tell their story to the judge.</p> <p>But we\u2019re not going there today.

We used to have legal visits inside the detention centre proper, in a room with bars in the door in the middle of a corridor of cells. The air conditioned demountables are much nicer. I worry, though, that we can\u2019t see inside the kid prison from the pristine demountables outside.</p> <p>We ring the buzzer, sign in and put our car keys and phones in the visitor lockers. I don\u2019t know any of the security guards here today. On other visits I\u2019ve been greeted by a bouncer I recognise from one of the more notorious pubs in town.</p> <p>They let the first kid on our list through the first gate, then the second gate.

He\u2019s been in for a long time and he\u2019s not been in any trouble since he\u2019s been here. He\u2019d like to finish school.

But hot behind the eyes doesn\u2019t need any sort of cross-cultural translation. I know what he means when he tells me that spending days in a cell with nothing to do and no one to talk to makes him hot behind the eyes. It makes me hot behind the eyes to hear him say it.</p> <p>We pull into the Kmart carpark across the road from Aboriginal Legal Aid. There are some folks sitting on the ground in the shade under the shop awning across the way. It\u2019s 41C. The ground must be burning.</p> <p>It\u2019s cooler inside. There\u2019s a whiteboard full of children\u2019s names above my desk with dots and dashes to indicate what type of matters they are, important dates, and when each child needs to be seen again. I have a whole cabinet full them \u2013 kids\u2019 lives that have been reduced to statements of fact and lists of antecedents.</p> <p>The drawers are also full of all the things these kids have told me about what\u2019s happened to them. The police officer who kept his hand around the boy\u2019s neck as he yelled that he couldn\u2019t breathe. The child who wanted to kill himself in detention because no one would listen to him. The 11-year-old who played with his plastic transformer in court. The kid who was charged with breaching his bail when he stayed at another family home because there was fighting in his. The one who was arrested at the doctor\u2019s for breaching bail and vomited at the police station.</p> <p>I tick off the kids we saw today.</p> <p>There\u2019s one kid on the board who has been up there for almost the whole two years I\u2019ve been in Alice Springs.

      "bodyText": "Who knew the drive to hell would be so beautiful and that hell would be so small? It\u2019s not far out of town, but it\u2019s far enough away to be deliberate. We drive out towards the airport \u2013 through the gap in the red ranges and down the gum-flanked Stuart Highway. The trunks shift from pale and shimmery to rich red and back again as we pass the racecourse, the billboards and the old Ghan Train by the side of the road. This is the road to somewhere else. For the folks who\u2019ve come here from the east coast or overseas, this is the road back home. For others it\u2019s the road to adventure. For everyone it\u2019s the road out of Alice Springs. The bitumen shifts from black to red and we turn right off the Stuart Highway towards Adelaide. Or, if you turn off earlier, Uluru. There\u2019s an in-between place before you get to either. It\u2019s just out of town. It\u2019s where we keep the people we don\u2019t want too close to home. That\u2019s where we\u2019re going. We go up and over a little bridge and drive across a dry creek bed. The sky is big and low out here. We drive past the first in-between place. It\u2019s a lowish cluster of off-white buildings behind a secure fence. It\u2019s where the police used to take people \u2013 almost always Aboriginal \u2013 who they\u2019d picked up for hitting the grog too hard. When I first arrived in the Northern Territory, the Alcohol Mandatory Treatment Tribunal was still up and running. It operated on the outdated belief that you can coerce someone out of addiction by forcing them into involuntary residential treatment. You\u2019d be unlikely to find yourself here unless you were an Aboriginal person who\u2019d been drinking in a public place \u2013 maybe in the Todd River or somewhere about town. If you were picked up by police three times in two months they could bring you in. You\u2019d be given a mattress on the floor and could wait for more than a week before a lawyer came and saw you. A man died a few years ago after being picked up by the police for drinking in a public place \u2013 not here in Alice Springs but up in Darwin. The police found him sitting under a tree. He had a sick heart. He\u2019d been in hospital just days before. He didn\u2019t want to go with police but they took him in anyway. They put him in a cell and he died there. That man was picked up under different laws than the ones that used to see folks dumped in this in-between place \u2013 but they\u2019re close enough. These laws were written for the same reason as we build these in-between places down long roads, and away from town centres; to pull them \u201cout of circulation\u201d (as the NT attorney general said in 2014). If we keep driving a little further you can see the prison watchtower on our right. For the most part the prison is a kind of purgatory. It\u2019s another in-between place. Hundreds of the folks in the big house have been charged with offences but have not been found guilty. They spend their summer days sweltering in almost 50C heat without air conditioning and in overcrowded dorms, waiting to tell their story to the judge. But we\u2019re not going there today. We turn right off the main road and stop at the Alice Springs youth detention centre. The red dirt car park is full of white government vehicles and security cars. They\u2019ve put demountables up in front of the detention centre; full of security personnel and strong, cold air conditioning. We used to have legal visits inside the detention centre proper, in a room with bars in the door in the middle of a corridor of cells. The air conditioned demountables are much nicer. I worry, though, that we can\u2019t see inside the kid prison from the pristine demountables outside. We ring the buzzer, sign in and put our car keys and phones in the visitor lockers. I don\u2019t know any of the security guards here today. On other visits I\u2019ve been greeted by a bouncer I recognise from one of the more notorious pubs in town. They let the first kid on our list through the first gate, then the second gate. The guard tells the boy to sit closest to the door. I say I want the door closed for the interview. The guard asks me to step outside. Outside he tells me where the duress button is. I nod. I say thanks. I know it\u2019s sensible, but it\u2019s hard to imagine using the duress button looking at this kid. He\u2019s all big cheeks and big eyes. I do most of the talking in my earnest white-lady lawyer way. My client clicks his tongue twice for yes and once for no. He sits side-on to me and looks at the ground. No one knows what to do with this kid. I think he knows that. He doesn\u2019t ask me what\u2019s going to happen next. We see a few kids today. The next two could not be more different from each other. One of them is softly spoken and serious. He looks at me when he talks, and looks down at the table as he listens. He tells me when he doesn\u2019t remember things, and describes with visible effort what he can recall. He is thoughtful when I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he wants to tell me, or that he would like me to do for him. He asks me if he can maybe get out of here early. He\u2019s been in for a long time and he\u2019s not been in any trouble since he\u2019s been here. He\u2019d like to finish school. His mum doesn\u2019t have a car so she hasn\u2019t been able to visit. He misses her. That\u2019s what happens at in-between places. Children fall through the cracks. One boy in here missed his mum so much that his call log shows him making over 100 calls in a month, but her phone doesn\u2019t always work and she also has no car to visit. The next kid is bouncing off the walls. He drums his fingers on the table to a beat inside his head. He beams at me when I remind him of my name and tells me he remembers it. He describes what has happened to him like he\u2019s watching a movie. He speaks quickly and dramatically, punctuating his story with wild gestures. \u201cAnd then I went BOOM and hit the ground. BOOM!\u201d It seems extraordinarily cruel to put a boy like this in a cage. When we\u2019re done talking, one of the security guards lets us back out through the gates. We sign out of the visitor\u2019s log, collect our car keys and mobile phones and begin the drive back to town. We\u2019re driving towards the purple mountain ranges this time. It\u2019s beautiful. I love this drive. I hate this drive. In some ways the drive back home is easier, but it takes a while to push the images of children in concrete boxes out from behind your retina and down your optic nerve and to bury their faces in the shadowy recesses of your brain. I really care about these kids. I\u2019m told lawyers aren\u2019t meant to have these fierce, protective feelings for their clients, but the law isn\u2019t meant to torture children either \u2013 so I figure we\u2019re even. I get hot behind the eyes. That\u2019s how one of the young fellas describes what happens to him when he\u2019s locked in his cell and gets angry. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to get on the same page as these kids. They\u2019re children. I\u2019m an adult. They\u2019re black. I\u2019m white. They\u2019re caged. I\u2019m free. Sometimes they\u2019re hopeless. Sometimes me too. But hot behind the eyes doesn\u2019t need any sort of cross-cultural translation. I know what he means when he tells me that spending days in a cell with nothing to do and no one to talk to makes him hot behind the eyes. It makes me hot behind the eyes to hear him say it. We pull into the Kmart carpark across the road from Aboriginal Legal Aid. There are some folks sitting on the ground in the shade under the shop awning across the way. It\u2019s 41C. The ground must be burning. It\u2019s cooler inside. There\u2019s a whiteboard full of children\u2019s names above my desk with dots and dashes to indicate what type of matters they are, important dates, and when each child needs to be seen again. I have a whole cabinet full them \u2013 kids\u2019 lives that have been reduced to statements of fact and lists of antecedents. The drawers are also full of all the things these kids have told me about what\u2019s happened to them. The police officer who kept his hand around the boy\u2019s neck as he yelled that he couldn\u2019t breathe. The child who wanted to kill himself in detention because no one would listen to him. The 11-year-old who played with his plastic transformer in court. The kid who was charged with breaching his bail when he stayed at another family home because there was fighting in his. The one who was arrested at the doctor\u2019s for breaching bail and vomited at the police station. I tick off the kids we saw today. There\u2019s one kid on the board who has been up there for almost the whole two years I\u2019ve been in Alice Springs. He has a big red circle around his name. That circle means maybe this kid is slowly being driven mad in that in-between place. It means we should go see him whenever we can. Even if it\u2019s Friday and we want to go to the pub after work. Check he\u2019s OK. OK. Surviving. Alive. Not any worse. Not too much worse. I put the pages of scribbled notes in the youths\u2019 files. I update the spreadsheet. I close the cabinet. We can go home now. We run into one of the grandmas crossing the road to Kmart. She tells me about a car she heard was stolen. Kids. She tells me that the grandmas are trying to organise visits with the kids in detention. She\u2019s been speaking with local politicians. I saw her at a rally not long back talking about bringing these kids home and keeping them close. But we don\u2019t let them keep these kids close. Oftentimes the boys are flown to Don Dale in Darwin because the kid-prison here gets too full. Or they ask to leave because there is nothing to do in prison in Alice Springs.

      "bodyText": "The vast majority of Australians (84%) support new laws to ban political parties and candidates from making \u201cinaccurate and misleading\u201d claims, according to a new poll for the Australia Institute. On Sunday the progressive thinktank released a discussion paper canvassing options for truth in political advertising laws, following reports of widespread misinformation in the 2019 election campaign and calls from MPs including independent Zali Steggall and Liberal Jason Falinski for new minimum standards. The paper noted that truth in advertising laws operate in South Australia, where the Electoral Commission can request material be withdrawn and retracted and financial penalties apply, and New Zealand, where the media industry is self-regulated by an advertising standards body. It argues that industry bodies including Free TV Australia and the Advertising Standards Bureau could regulate truth in advertising, preventing the Australian Electoral Commission from being drawn into the contentious political process of adjudication. \u201cSeveral models for increasing the truthfulness of election campaigns are available to policymakers,\u201d it said. \u201cThey are popular and proven to work in other jurisdictions.\u201d The paper includes results from a Dynata survey of 1,464 people conducted in the last week of July, with a margin of error of 3%, that found 84% of all voters want truth in advertising laws, with support in Labor, the Coalition and Greens all above the 84% level. Most respondents supported a range of penalties including fines (62%), forcing publications to retract claims (60%) and loss of public funding (54%). Criminal charges were supported by 42% of respondents. Respondents were unsure who should be the arbiter of truth, with support split between the judicial system (27%), electoral commissions (26%) and industry bodies (21%), with 15% unsure and 7% suggesting a new panel of experts. The survey also found 90% support for the proposition that newspapers, TV channels and social media networks should run corrections if they publish inaccurate or misleading ads. The 2019 election saw a range of false claims made in political ads, including that Labor planned to tax non-electric vehicles, and on social media, such as that Labor planned to introduce a death tax. Two challenges against misleading Chinese-language signs in Kooyong and Chisholm that used AEC colours to urge voters to vote Liberal have been lodged in the court of disputed returns. On Wednesday Australia\u2019s competition regulator Rod Sims told Guardian Australia social media giant Facebook should have removed the bogus death tax claims but chose not to, a move he said was aimed at protecting its bottom line. The Australia Institute director, Ben Oquist, said that truth in political advertising laws \u201ccould help to preserve the integrity of our democratic process\u201d. \u201cThe public should be able to have confidence in what they see and hear during Australian elections which, unless action is taken, risk sliding into fake news free-for-alls,\u201d he said. \u201cDecisions about what constitutes the truth may be fraught, but this reform has been achieved in other jurisdictions and these sorts of considerations are already routinely made by companies and regulators under consumer law.\u201d Critics of truth in advertising laws argue that it can be difficult to adjudicate claims, particularly in relation to the future. For example, the former AEC official Michael Maley has questioned whether politicians \u201chave a legal right to be believed when they say they don\u2019t have a plan to do something\u201d. \u201cIn 2013 Tony Abbott said there would be no cuts to the ABC or SBS \u2013 he denied [the cuts], so does that mean you can\u2019t say anymore about it?\u201d The report argued that there was \u201cno need to be paralysed by existential questions about the truth\u201d because \u201ca range of truth in political advertising regulations work reasonably well and any of them could improve on the status quo\u201d.",

Eight of them were, like Norwood, appearing in the Premier League for the first time. \u201cWe were a little nervy at first but we grew into the game and a draw was a fair result,\u201d he says. His team are odds-on favourites to be relegated but Palace and the rest of the division would be fools to underestimate them. \u201cThe perception is we\u2019re not supposed to be here,\u201d says Norwood. \u201cPeople are entitled to their opinions. But we\u2019ll just keep chipping away and proving people wrong.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Internazionale are hoping to sign Alexis S\u00e1nchez on a season-long loan and are confident of agreeing a deal with Manchester United. The striker turned down a move to Roma last week, with United reported to have offered to cover a large proportion of his \u00a3300,000-a-week wages. Yet having already signed Romelu Lukaku for \u00a374m, the Inter manager, Antonio Conte, has turned his attention to the 30-year-old after missing out on Edin Dzeko, who has signed a new three-year contract with Roma amid speculation he could move to San Siro. Fernando Llorente \u2013 currently without a club having left Tottenham at the end of last season \u2013 is understood to be another option for the Italians. S\u00e1nchez was left out of United\u2019s squad for the opening-day victory over Chelsea, although Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r said on Friday that the former Arsenal forward was still not ready after playing for his country at the Copa Am\u00e9rica. \u201cAlexis is such a professional and he comes in working every single day really hard and he wants to be a part of this,\u201d the United manager said. \u201cThere are these stories he\u2019s been put in the reserves \u2013 of course he hasn\u2019t, he\u2019s part of our squad and he is a really good player. He has had three weeks now, so he\u2019s a few weeks behind the rest but close to being part of it. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the biggest forward line in numbers so Alexis might end up playing a lot more games than you expect and we expect him to come good at this club; he\u2019s quality.\u201d",

Why go for that when there\u2019s a more direct route?\u201d</p> <p>MPs plan to pass a law stating that the prime minister must request a delay to Brexit to avoid a no-deal outcome. However, their challenge has been to find a parliamentary device enabling them to do so. There are no guarantees of success, but tactics include amending a vote relating to the Northern Ireland executive, altering parliament\u2019s standing orders, and using an emergency debate to seize control of the parliamentary timetable \u2013 which is not usually allowed under parliament\u2019s current rulebook.</p> <p>The stakes are high. Dominic Grieve, a Tory MP who has been a leader of the efforts, said that he had received death threats as a result of Johnson\u2019s Brexit rhetoric.</p> <p>Downing Street is said to be holding daily meetings about how to delay legislation in September \u2013 a tactic designed to take away opportunities for MPs to hijack government plans with measures opposing no deal. However, rebels already believe they can act without any legislation being presented by the government. \u201cThey are planning on how to take away any hooks, but we don\u2019t need hooks,\u201d said one of those involved.</p> <p>Some insiders have been pleased that much public attention has been focused on the idea of a government of national unity, which took the spotlight off their plans to seize control of parliament and pass an anti-no-deal law next month. Others are also happy that ideas are being stressed-tested now. One former minister said: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad use of the summer for unworkable ideas to be aired, scrutinised and dismissed.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b5c51525da78123e461d80d370c07f5f96a29159\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5c51525da78123e461d80d370c07f5f96a29159/513_245_4895_2937/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jo Swinson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jo Swinson</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tolga Akmen/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The row over who should lead a unity government following a no-confidence vote in Johnson\u2019s administration was ignited when Jo Swinson, the new Lib Dem leader, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/15/corbyns-plan-to-lead-caretaker-government-unworkable-say-lib-dems\" title=\"\">rejected Corbyn\u2019s offer to lead a temporary government </a>as \u201ca nonsense\u201d. Swinson has since softened her rhetoric.</p> <p>Corbyn\u2019s letter offering to lead a temporary government came after Tom Watson, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, and Swinson discussed cross-party efforts to stop no deal. \u201cIt was absolutely the right thing for Jeremy to do and forced the Lib Dems into an error,\u201d said a Labour MP usually critical of Corbyn.</p> <p>Most accept that, while Swinson was too dismissive of Corbyn\u2019s offer, she was right to conclude that a Corbyn-led emergency government was a non-starter. Opponents of no deal calculate that at least eight Tory rebels would be needed, and some of the most likely have already this ruled out.</p> <p>MPs in all parties are already discussing ways of sidelining Corbyn by seeing if there is enough support for a unity leader, such as Harriet Harman or Ken Clarke, who would not require the support of Labour\u2019s front bench. Ultimately, several Labour MPs believe Corbyn will back a unity figure if his own attempt to form a government has failed and no deal looms.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019ll get a bite of the cherry \u2013 no one can stop him trying to form a government,\u201d said one MP. \u201cThe real issue is, after that, will he make way or see no deal happen?

      "bodyText": "Senior Labour and Conservative MPs leading the battle to stop a no-deal Brexit are focusing on passing a \u201cradical\u201d new law to block it, after concluding that there is no imminent prospect of toppling Boris Johnson and installing an emergency government. Last week was punctuated by rows among MPs over who should lead a temporary government to stop a no-deal Brexit, with the Lib Dems and other MPs refusing to back any move that would put Jeremy Corbyn in No 10. However, those planning to use legislation to stop the UK crashing out of the EU believe there is a growing majority for their plans and think No 10 will be unable to stop them. Shadow cabinet members and cabinet ministers who departed with the arrival of Johnson are among those backing the strategy in preference to a no-confidence vote in the prime minister. They believe the hardline tactics deployed by Dominic Cummings, who ran the Vote Leave campaign and is now the prime minister\u2019s key adviser, have swelled the numbers prepared to act. \u201cThis is not the time for boring and neutral tactics,\u201d said one figure involved. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a time for typical deference. These people will show no deference and give no quarter \u2013 and we need to be just as ruthless and organised as they are.\u201d A senior Labour figure said: \u201cPeople are slightly barking up the wrong tree. My strong view is that there is a clear majority to try to stop no deal. It\u2019s stronger now because those coming out of the cabinet are undoubtedly swelling the numbers, but also swelling the morale on the Tory side to do something. It feels like the majority is stronger than it was and the determination is stronger.\u201d A third figure said: \u201cFor my money, I don\u2019t think a no-confidence vote will be particularly winnable in early September \u2013 even some opposition MPs wouldn\u2019t back it. Why go for that when there\u2019s a more direct route?\u201d MPs plan to pass a law stating that the prime minister must request a delay to Brexit to avoid a no-deal outcome. However, their challenge has been to find a parliamentary device enabling them to do so. There are no guarantees of success, but tactics include amending a vote relating to the Northern Ireland executive, altering parliament\u2019s standing orders, and using an emergency debate to seize control of the parliamentary timetable \u2013 which is not usually allowed under parliament\u2019s current rulebook. The stakes are high. Dominic Grieve, a Tory MP who has been a leader of the efforts, said that he had received death threats as a result of Johnson\u2019s Brexit rhetoric. Downing Street is said to be holding daily meetings about how to delay legislation in September \u2013 a tactic designed to take away opportunities for MPs to hijack government plans with measures opposing no deal. However, rebels already believe they can act without any legislation being presented by the government. \u201cThey are planning on how to take away any hooks, but we don\u2019t need hooks,\u201d said one of those involved. Some insiders have been pleased that much public attention has been focused on the idea of a government of national unity, which took the spotlight off their plans to seize control of parliament and pass an anti-no-deal law next month. Others are also happy that ideas are being stressed-tested now. One former minister said: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad use of the summer for unworkable ideas to be aired, scrutinised and dismissed.\u201d The row over who should lead a unity government following a no-confidence vote in Johnson\u2019s administration was ignited when Jo Swinson, the new Lib Dem leader, rejected Corbyn\u2019s offer to lead a temporary government as \u201ca nonsense\u201d. Swinson has since softened her rhetoric. Corbyn\u2019s letter offering to lead a temporary government came after Tom Watson, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, and Swinson discussed cross-party efforts to stop no deal. \u201cIt was absolutely the right thing for Jeremy to do and forced the Lib Dems into an error,\u201d said a Labour MP usually critical of Corbyn. Most accept that, while Swinson was too dismissive of Corbyn\u2019s offer, she was right to conclude that a Corbyn-led emergency government was a non-starter. Opponents of no deal calculate that at least eight Tory rebels would be needed, and some of the most likely have already this ruled out. MPs in all parties are already discussing ways of sidelining Corbyn by seeing if there is enough support for a unity leader, such as Harriet Harman or Ken Clarke, who would not require the support of Labour\u2019s front bench. Ultimately, several Labour MPs believe Corbyn will back a unity figure if his own attempt to form a government has failed and no deal looms. \u201cHe\u2019ll get a bite of the cherry \u2013 no one can stop him trying to form a government,\u201d said one MP. \u201cThe real issue is, after that, will he make way or see no deal happen? That is coming down the road.\u201d Meanwhile, many Conservatives still hope Johnson will return to the Commons at the 11th hour with one last chance to vote for a Brexit deal similar to that offered by Theresa May. They believe Labour MPs opposed to a second referendum, such as Lisa Nandy, could be convinced to back it. While most are convinced that Cummings is prepared to leave the EU without a deal, some also expect serving ministers to rebel should such an outcome look imminent. \u201cI just think their inner Tory who cares about the economy will scream at ministers as it did for Theresa May,\u201d said one former minister. \u201cI think Cummings will be told \u2018no\u2019 and then sort of explode like a Dr Who dalek whose wires are fatally crossed, screaming \u2018exterminate.\u2019\u201d Stopping no deal Corbyn-led temporary government Jeremy Corbyn has offered to lead a temporary government tasked with requesting a delay to Brexit from the EU, before triggering an election. Likelihood: one in five Government of national unity Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, has said Corbyn cannot command enough support to lead a temporary government.

The 30-day revocation was announced on Friday and echoes hugely controversial action taken against CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta in November 2018. Acosta, a frequent irritation to Trump, had his pass taken away after the administration claimed he used inappropriate force in resisting an intern\u2019s attempts to take a microphone from him during a news conference given by the president.

Both men attracted criticism for their behaviour. In a letter to White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham, Karem\u2019s attorney Ted Boutrous, who also represented Acosta, described the decision as \u201carbitrary and unfair\u201d and claimed the White House had not spoken to a single witness seen on video \u201ctaunting and/or threatening Mr Karem\u201d. Boutrous argued that the White House\u2019s decision \u201cviolates the first amendment and due process and is yet another example of this administration\u2019s unconstitutional campaign to punish reporters and press coverage that president Trump doesn\u2019t like\u201d. He added: \u201cThe president and his administration are fostering an atmosphere of hostility and violence towards journalists that cannot be tolerated and they are illegally using the credential process to stifle freedom of the press and to disrupt the flow of vital information to the American people.\u201d In response, also posted online by Boutros\u2019s law firm, Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher, Grisham described Karem\u2019s behaviour as \u201cinappropriate\u201d and repeated what he said to Gorka: \u201cHey brother we can talk anytime you want or go outside and have a long talk.\u201d In response, Gorka shouted at Karem: \u201cYou\u2019re a punk!

Earlier this year Acosta published a book, The Enemy of the People: A Dangerous Time to Tell the Truth in America, about his experiences covering Trump. Karem became a CNN contributor in September 2017, shortly after clashing with Sanders at a White House briefing.",

It is vital that countries come together to do all they can.\u201d</p> <p>The Cites agreement regulates the international trade in wildlife, from live animals to skins and timber, and unlike other international conventions can punish countries that flout bans by barring them from lucrative markets.</p> <p>In the run-up to the meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, conservationists have called for sanctions against Mexico, home to the vaquita, a porpoise on the edge of extinction with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/31/fewer-than-19-vaquita-porpoises-left-study-mexico-illegal-fishing-nets\">only about 19 left alive</a>. The vaquita\u2019s demise also illustrates the deadly role of criminals in the destruction of wildlife. The illegal wildlife trade is estimated to be worth $7bn to $23bn a year, ranking only behind drugs, human trafficking and weapons.</p> <p>\u201cThe vaquita is really a poster child for what is happening in terms of international criminal networks and wildlife,\u201d said Higuero. \u201cThey use wildlife like drugs, prostitution and arms, because the financial rewards are high.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4355aeaa335038e592126b3ba361dd61b4bbac29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4355aeaa335038e592126b3ba361dd61b4bbac29/154_145_2844_1707/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A vaquita swims in the sea.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A vaquita swims in the sea.

[Otherwise] that will be on us, a major extinction on our watch at the hands of criminals.\u201d</p> <p>Vietnam will also come under pressure, after independent analyses found it was the largest destination for illegal elephant ivory and rhino horn. Margaret Kinnaird, head of global wildlife at the WWF, said: \u201cVietnam has been of great concern for many years now \u2013 much more has to be done.\u201d</p> <p>Another flashpoint will be opposing proposals on elephants, of which about 20,000 are poached every year for the illegal ivory trade. Southern African countries, home to large populations, want to loosen restrictions to raise funds for conservation. But others on the continent want to make the ivory ban even broader.</p> <p>Higuero hoped progress might be made by focusing on a goal all the countries share \u2013 to improve their citizens\u2019 lives. \u201c[Local communities] want to put food on their tables, education for their children, hospitals and healthcare,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is very easy for people from outside to say \u2018don\u2019t do this, don\u2019t do that\u2019 but what are the options we can give them so they feel they are gaining something from taking care of nature?\u201d</p> <p>The most unusual proposal at the summit is to put an extinct species \u2013 the woolly mammoth \u2013 on the list of species for which trade is restricted. \u201cIt would absolutely be the first time,\u201d Higuero said. \u201cThe fear is that elephant ivory is being traded as if it were mammoth ivory.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b04d4bc0f189f42c13fbe4566bd0ebf6a9542a02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b04d4bc0f189f42c13fbe4566bd0ebf6a9542a02/0_19_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carvings of elephants and other animals are displayed inside a mammoth ivory tusk, in a shop window in Chinatown, San Francisco.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carvings of elephants and other animals are displayed inside a mammoth ivory tusk, in a shop window in Chinatown, San Francisco.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Risberg/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The summit may also bring good news, with some species being taken off danger lists because their populations are recovering. One, the vicu\u00f1a, is a relative of the llama and provides extremely valuable wool. Higuero said the prospects of the animal had been improved by getting local communities involved in their conservation. \u201cThis is definitely a demonstration of how successful you can be when there are issues of humans and wildlife living side by side,\u201d she added.</p> <p>A quartet of Australian rodents may also be struck off the list of species in which all trade is banned, for the simple reason that no one wants to buy the greater stick nest rat, the false swamp rat, the central rock rat and the Shark Bay mouse.</p>",

It is vital that countries come together to do all they can.\u201d The Cites agreement regulates the international trade in wildlife, from live animals to skins and timber, and unlike other international conventions can punish countries that flout bans by barring them from lucrative markets. In the run-up to the meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, conservationists have called for sanctions against Mexico, home to the vaquita, a porpoise on the edge of extinction with only about 19 left alive. The vaquita\u2019s demise also illustrates the deadly role of criminals in the destruction of wildlife. The illegal wildlife trade is estimated to be worth $7bn to $23bn a year, ranking only behind drugs, human trafficking and weapons. \u201cThe vaquita is really a poster child for what is happening in terms of international criminal networks and wildlife,\u201d said Higuero. \u201cThey use wildlife like drugs, prostitution and arms, because the financial rewards are high.\u201d The vaquita is killed as bycatch when fishers target the totoaba, a large fish whose swim bladder can sell illegally for $20,000 a kilogram in China because of its supposed medicinal properties. \u201cPeople have been killed,\u201d Higuero said. \u201cThe [drug] cartels are involved, they are heavily armed and it seems the navy and police can\u2019t control it, so you have a governance crisis.\u201d She said the area of sea involved was just a quarter of the size of Los Angeles: \u201cIf we can\u2019t protect this, what hope is there for anything else?\u201d Clare Perry, a senior campaigner at the Environmental Investigation Agency, said: \u201cThis is the last chance for Cites to spur real action to save the vaquita. [Otherwise] that will be on us, a major extinction on our watch at the hands of criminals.\u201d Vietnam will also come under pressure, after independent analyses found it was the largest destination for illegal elephant ivory and rhino horn. Margaret Kinnaird, head of global wildlife at the WWF, said: \u201cVietnam has been of great concern for many years now \u2013 much more has to be done.\u201d Another flashpoint will be opposing proposals on elephants, of which about 20,000 are poached every year for the illegal ivory trade. Southern African countries, home to large populations, want to loosen restrictions to raise funds for conservation. But others on the continent want to make the ivory ban even broader. Higuero hoped progress might be made by focusing on a goal all the countries share \u2013 to improve their citizens\u2019 lives. \u201c[Local communities] want to put food on their tables, education for their children, hospitals and healthcare,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is very easy for people from outside to say \u2018don\u2019t do this, don\u2019t do that\u2019 but what are the options we can give them so they feel they are gaining something from taking care of nature?\u201d The most unusual proposal at the summit is to put an extinct species \u2013 the woolly mammoth \u2013 on the list of species for which trade is restricted. \u201cIt would absolutely be the first time,\u201d Higuero said. \u201cThe fear is that elephant ivory is being traded as if it were mammoth ivory.\u201d The summit may also bring good news, with some species being taken off danger lists because their populations are recovering. One, the vicu\u00f1a, is a relative of the llama and provides extremely valuable wool. Higuero said the prospects of the animal had been improved by getting local communities involved in their conservation. \u201cThis is definitely a demonstration of how successful you can be when there are issues of humans and wildlife living side by side,\u201d she added. A quartet of Australian rodents may also be struck off the list of species in which all trade is banned, for the simple reason that no one wants to buy the greater stick nest rat, the false swamp rat, the central rock rat and the Shark Bay mouse.",

This time the cross came hard and low, and Ag\u00fcero was there to meet it with a trademark near-post flick. Had G\u00fcndogan proved as deadly from De Bruyne\u2019s next contribution the points might have been wrapped up by half-time. Instead the midfielder sidefooted narrowly wide after another precision cross from the right unerringly found its intended target. De Bruyne opened the second half with a surging run of his own, apologising to the better-placed Sterling for shooting rather than passing as the goal came into view. The captain missed by inches during a spell when City were creating chance after chance without making their superiority count and Guardiola\u2019s annoyance was clear when an inspired substitution by Mauricio Pochettino paid dividends. Not that Tottenham were in any way lucky to claim a point. For all City\u2019s dominance it was telling that David Silva was sent on before the end. Guardiola might have raised a few eyebrows when he described Spurs as the second-best team in Europe but there is a resilience to the Champions League runners-up that can only be admired. Twice they fought back to level, Lucas Moura\u2019s equaliser coming after a succession of City chances that should have left the outcome beyond doubt. Going behind after 20 solid minutes of City pressure did not ruffle their composure. They simply kept their shape, continued to look for openings and found an equaliser within three minutes. \u00c9rik Lamela made scoring look easy, simply passing the ball into the net from the edge of the area, though credit is due to Tanguy Ndombela for finding him in space. Tottenham\u2019s record signing looked an excellent acquisition, willing to drive forward from midfield in the manner Spurs had hoped, but also alert to the quick pass or accurate through-ball to set a teammate in motion. Defensively, he was caught out on a couple of occasions, though at least he will not find himself up against De Bruyne every week.",

The amount of shots we created was incredible. But the result is all that counts. We would like to win, because the guys deserve it, but football is like this.\u201d As for the dramatic disallowed goal? \u201cDeja vu. It was the same! The last action, we score, and VAR disallows it. So what should I say? The second time, it\u2019s tough, but it is what it is. It\u2019s the new rules.\u201d He then cites a couple of poor decisions in the Super Cup final. \u201cSo they have to fix it. VAR is here. The images are not clear, but if they think it\u2019s hands ... now we have to accept it. It wasn\u2019t a penalty in the first half, which I found incredible. But we move forward.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d584c0e8f0896be8f8fb09a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-17T18:53:16.712Z\">7.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>A very content Mauricio Pochettino speaks to Sky Sports.</strong> \u201cI am in love with VAR! Sometimes you get the benefits. Today and in the Champions League. You cannot stop the progression of the technology. We need to accept that we are living in a different era. It\u2019s a benefit for us today, but we need to accept it when it\u2019s against us too. It was an amazing feeling, just like it was in the Champions League.\u201d He goes on to say that he\u2019d quite like to go to a Manchester restaurant with Pep, so they can have a long talk about VAR.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d584b288f08c7e177d4c621\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-17T18:48:33.605Z\">7.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>It\u2019s worth pointing out that the handball law has been revised.</strong> So if \u201cthe ball goes into the goal after touching an attacking player\u2019s hand/arm\u201d, it\u2019s a free kick \u201ceven if accidental\u201d. Manchester City fans may feel VAR has done a number on them tonight - nobody spotted the infringement in real time, and no Spurs player appealed - but it\u2019s technically the correct decision. This is VAR.

It\u2019s a bit unlucky for City. Anyone can have a different interpretation. But then I looked at the screen and realised it was a hand ball. But we are very happy with the point. It shows our personality and character. We need to enjoy the moment.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Lucas Moura adds: </strong>\u201cIt was crazy. I thought it was finished. But this type of action is hard to see. Only the VAR can see. So thank you for it! But we played very well, and it was a good result for us, because we know how difficult it is to play here.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d5848f88f084f687f358649\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-17T18:38:14.718Z\">7.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>So here are the stats. </strong>City had 30 attempts on goal to Tottenham\u2019s three. I think I\u2019m right in saying one of Tottenham\u2019s efforts was a speculative dig from the halfway line by Harry Kane. Ten of those City efforts were on target; Spurs scored with both of theirs. The expected goals, for those of you who like that sort of thing, has the result as City 3, Spurs 0.22. City took 52 touches in the Tottenham area; Spurs just five in City\u2019s. City had 13 corners; Spurs just two. And the home side enjoyed 56% of possession, which probably is the least lop-sided stat of all.

But the visitors were resilient beyond belief. They needed a little luck - VAR was on their side today, not just at the end, but also with the non-award of a penalty in the first half - but they also took it with a superb display of defensive grit. That\u2019s their first away draw in 16 months.

We might only be nine days into the new season, but as both teams have designs on the Premier League title, this qualifies as a proper six-pointer. Sniff if you like, but there it is.</p> <p><strong>City will be confident of making an early statement in their quest to join Huddersfield Town, Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United as three-peat winners of the English top division. </strong>As if sticking five past West Ham at their own gaff wasn\u2019t enough. They\u2019re currently on a 15-game winning streak in the league, and are on a four-match winning run against this evening\u2019s opponents. They\u2019ve beaten Tottenham seven times in their last nine visits. And Spurs have a dismal record against the top clubs of late: just seven points against the other members of the self-styled Big Six last year.</p> <p><strong>On the flip side, that four-game winning streak of City\u2019s is a league-only affair. </strong>It doesn\u2019t include the Champions League quarter-final bedlam between the two sides last April, two matches that fair took the wind out of City\u2019s continental sail, and briefly threatened to derail their Premier League campaign, as Pep\u2019s men huffed and puffed to a one-goal win over the same opponents three days later. So Spurs are unlikely to feel too overawed, despite the overall picture.</p> <p><strong>But they\u2019ll need to perform a lot better than they did during those Christian-Eriksen-free minutes against Aston Villa last weekend. </strong>Can they raise their game and give the champions a fright? Or will City keep on keepin\u2019 on? We\u2019ll find out soon enough. It\u2019s on!</p> <p><strong>Kick off: </strong>5.30pm BST.</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "Daniel Taylor was at the Etihad. Here\u2019s his take on a dramatic match that bordered on the surreal. Enjoy his report, and thanks for reading this one. Nighty night! Pep Guardiola reflects on his team\u2019s disappointment with trademark class. \u201cWe played incredible against the second best team in Europe, the finalists of the Champions League, so I am so proud. The amount of shots we created was incredible. But the result is all that counts. We would like to win, because the guys deserve it, but football is like this.\u201d As for the dramatic disallowed goal? \u201cDeja vu. It was the same! The last action, we score, and VAR disallows it. So what should I say? The second time, it\u2019s tough, but it is what it is. It\u2019s the new rules.\u201d He then cites a couple of poor decisions in the Super Cup final. \u201cSo they have to fix it. VAR is here. The images are not clear, but if they think it\u2019s hands ... now we have to accept it. It wasn\u2019t a penalty in the first half, which I found incredible. But we move forward.\u201d A very content Mauricio Pochettino speaks to Sky Sports. \u201cI am in love with VAR! Sometimes you get the benefits. Today and in the Champions League. You cannot stop the progression of the technology. We need to accept that we are living in a different era. It\u2019s a benefit for us today, but we need to accept it when it\u2019s against us too. It was an amazing feeling, just like it was in the Champions League.\u201d He goes on to say that he\u2019d quite like to go to a Manchester restaurant with Pep, so they can have a long talk about VAR. It\u2019s worth pointing out that the handball law has been revised. So if \u201cthe ball goes into the goal after touching an attacking player\u2019s hand/arm\u201d, it\u2019s a free kick \u201ceven if accidental\u201d. Manchester City fans may feel VAR has done a number on them tonight - nobody spotted the infringement in real time, and no Spurs player appealed - but it\u2019s technically the correct decision. This is VAR. This is what everyone wanted. Tottenham captain Hugo Lloris speaks to Sky Sports. \u201cTo be honest, I thought it was a goal. It\u2019s a bit unlucky for City. Anyone can have a different interpretation. But then I looked at the screen and realised it was a hand ball. But we are very happy with the point. It shows our personality and character. We need to enjoy the moment.\u201d Lucas Moura adds: \u201cIt was crazy. I thought it was finished. But this type of action is hard to see. Only the VAR can see. So thank you for it! But we played very well, and it was a good result for us, because we know how difficult it is to play here.\u201d So here are the stats. City had 30 attempts on goal to Tottenham\u2019s three. I think I\u2019m right in saying one of Tottenham\u2019s efforts was a speculative dig from the halfway line by Harry Kane. Ten of those City efforts were on target; Spurs scored with both of theirs. The expected goals, for those of you who like that sort of thing, has the result as City 3, Spurs 0.22. City took 52 touches in the Tottenham area; Spurs just five in City\u2019s. City had 13 corners; Spurs just two. And the home side enjoyed 56% of possession, which probably is the least lop-sided stat of all. But it ended 2-2. City dominated pretty much from start to finish. Exact stats when we have them, but they created roughly ten times the number of chances made by Spurs. But the visitors were resilient beyond belief. They needed a little luck - VAR was on their side today, not just at the end, but also with the non-award of a penalty in the first half - but they also took it with a superb display of defensive grit. That\u2019s their first away draw in 16 months. If it has to be a stalemate, best make it memorable, eh? Gabriel Jesus, his match-winning goal snatched away from him, engages in a full and frank discussion with referee Michael Oliver. He\u2019s ushered away by Harry Kane before he says something he really regrets. Then his manager comes on to shake the referee\u2019s hand. He doesn\u2019t say much, but his gaze lingers a little longer than it might in less dramatic circumstances. Guardiola races off down the tunnel, his side having somehow dropped a couple of points this evening. That was quite surreal, all told. Sterling has a shot that\u2019s blocked. Then there\u2019s a melee in the Spurs box. And finally the whistle blows. That\u2019s that! How on earth has that ended 2-2?! It\u2019s ended 2-2, though. 90 min +5: The dugouts again. Pep is now hugging his opposite number Mauricio Pochettino. More bedlam, but now it\u2019s mixed with the stunned disbelief of the City support. The ball came off Laporte\u2019s arm in the build-up! The goal\u2019s quite correctly chalked off! City have been denied by VAR against Spurs yet again! 90 min +3: On the touchline, Pep turns and stares at Aguero on the bench. His decision vindicated. But ... David Silva works his way down the right and earns a corner. De Bruyne hooks it in. Laporte flicks the ball on for Jesus, level with the left-hand post. He takes a touch back inside, and curls the winner into the bottom right! Bedlam! 90 min +1: In the first of four additional minutes, Oliver Skipp comes on for Christian Eriksen. 90 min: Zinchenko looks to have recovered. He\u2019s patrolling the left flank in the busy fashion. He crosses deep, but Laporte gets overly excited in the box and concedes a foul that takes the pressure off the visitors. 89 min: Manchester City have made 29 attempts on goal. Spurs just three. \u201cThere is no logical explanation for this match,\u201d says Mary Waltz. \u201cAwesome, isn\u2019t it?\u201d 88 min: Eriksen has the chance to release Kane down the right, but dawdles and is stripped of possession. Not entirely sure how we\u2019ve got here, but this really could go either way now. 86 min: For a second, it doesn\u2019t look as though Zinchenko will be able to continue. He\u2019s on the touchline feeling his hamstring. But he insists on coming back on. City would be otherwise down to ten men. Presumably it\u2019s just a bad case of cramp, as opposed to a muscle tweak, or this is a bit risky. Anyway, in the meantime, Lamela is replaced for Lo Celso, who comes on to make his Spurs debut at the home of the champions. 84 min: Zinchenko is down, feeling his hamstring. He\u2019s shaking his head at the bench. Or is it cramp? The doctors give his leg a good old stretch. 82 min: City keep on pressing. But suddenly Moura breaks up the other end. He\u2019s got Lamela to one side, and Kane on the other. He feeds Lamela, who immediately extracts all momentum from the move. A great chance to complete a sensational turnaround is spurned. 80 min: Now Bernardo Silva is swapped for Riyad Mahrez. Some bench City have, huh? 79 min: This surely can\u2019t end 2-2. There have been so many chances. With further goals in mind, Pep replaces Rodri with David Silva. Then De Bruyne crosses from the right. Jesus sends a header inches left of goal. So close. 77 min: Nope. In fact it\u2019s City who nearly score a third, breaking four on two from the Spurs corner. But De Bruyne\u2019s attempt to release Jesus goes wrong when he clanks his pass against his team-mate\u2019s ankle. 76 min: Moura tears past a snoozing Zinchenko, reaching the byline out on the right. He whips back for Kane, but Otamendi slides in to divert the ball out for a corner. Are we about to witness one of the all-time smash and grabs? 75 min: Zinchenko floats a ball into the Spurs box from the right. Under no pressure whatsoever, Rose heads behind for a corner. Shades of the Champions League final, just before Divock Origi scored Liverpool\u2019s clincher. But nothing so dramatic comes of this one. City are beginning to look a little frustrated. 74 min: De Bruyne barrels down the right and whips a low ball into the area. Sanchez does well to cut it out at the near post, with a lot of sky-blue-shirted trouble waiting behind him. 72 min: Bernardo Silva crosses into the Spurs mixer from the right. Jesus, on the left-hand corner of the six-yard box, brings the ball down with his chest, but can\u2019t swivel to get his shot on target. Goal kick. 70 min: The corner\u2019s worked from right to left for Sterling, who hooks high into the box. Lloris rises to claim, and is barged in the rugby line-out style by Otamendi. Pressure off, needlessly, once again. The home crowd are getting a little worried, and take it out on the stricken Lloris. Booooo. 69 min: Jesus dribbles towards the Spurs box. He one-twos with De Bruyne and enters the crowded area. He drops his shoulder once, twice, three times, in the hope of making space to shoot. Eventually he takes a dig, but Sanchez blocks out for a corner. 68 min: Another corner for City. De Bruyne uncharacteristically relieves the pressure on Spurs by hoicking a high and wild cross over everyone\u2019s head from the left. 66 min: Sergio Aguero is hooked. Gabriel Jesus replaces him. And then on the touchline Aguero instigates a hard and fast discussion with his manager. For a second, it looks like Pep is about to cuff his player around the lug, but he\u2019s ushered away from the situation. It all calms down quickly enough, anyway. All good pantomime fun, which will no doubt be blown out of all proportion later. 64 min: A rare period of play in the centre of the park. \u201cThis match is insane,\u201d writes Mary Waltz, who is not wrong. 62 min: Yes, this is quite deliciously daft. De Bruyne crosses from the left. Bernardo Silva nearly turns the ball into the net from close range. It\u2019s deflected out for a corner. From the set piece, Aguero and Otamendi take turns to send the ball flying goalwards. Spurs somehow manage to clear. How is the scoreline of this match 2-2? 61 min: This is getting daft. Lloris comes out to meet the corner, but flaps. Bernardo Silva flicks over the stranded keeper and towards the empty net. The ball clanks off the crossbar and into the arms of the blushing keeper. 60 min: The Spurs fans are giving it plenty. The home crowd can\u2019t quite believe what they\u2019ve just seen. It\u2019s all very strange, because the match had been a rout in all but scoreline. But now everything changes. Rodri tries to restore order by creaming a rising shot from 25 yards straight at Lloris, who tips over for a corner. 58 min: Moura had been on the field for 19 seconds! Most of that was running on, then waiting for the corner to be taken. So a couple of seconds of action tops. That\u2019s some introduction. The corner\u2019s swung in from the right. Moura rises highest, and guides a header into the top left, past a sprawling Ederson. What a first touch! What a substitution! What a preposterous scoreline, given the overall balance of the game. 55 min: This is better from Spurs. A period of possession in the middle of the park. Lamela then wedges down the middle. Eriksen chests down on the edge of the area. He can\u2019t get a shot away, but is able to force a corner on the right. Before it\u2019s taken, Lucas Moura comes on for Winks, and ... 54 min: Now a pass is slipped down the inside-right channel by Sterling, releasing Bernardo Silva into the box. Silva opens up his body and tries to pass the ball into the bottom left. Lloris gathers. That\u2019s City\u2019s 18th attempt at goal. Spurs have so far made one. 53 min: Zinchenko to Sterling to Aguero. The ball simply shuttled down the inside-left channel. Aguero strides into the box and lashes a shot over the bar. 51 min: City are looking to wrap the three points up in short order. De Bruyne cuts in from the right and fizzes a diagonal shot wide of the left-hand post. Not entirely sure Lloris would have got to that, had it been on target. 50 min: Another City corner. This time De Bruyne whips in from the left with extreme violence. Lloris punches clear with confidence. Laporte goes down in the meantime, claiming he was tugged to the floor by Sissoko, but come off it. 49 min: ... and City nearly score from it. The ball\u2019s pulled back to Zinchenko, whose low shot through a thicket of players is deflected and heads towards the bottom left. Lloris, initially wrong-footed, saves with a strong hand. 48 min: Rose bursts down the left and hoicks a cross into the City box. It\u2019s not aimed at anyone in particular and easily claimed by Ederson. City go straight up the other end, De Bruyne taking a shot from distance. The ball\u2019s deflected out for a corner. 46 min: City are almost immediately on the attack, Walker sprinting down the right and whipping low towards the near post. Lloris does extremely well to gather a hard ball without spilling, Aguero lurking nearby. Here we go again! Spurs get the second half underway. No changes yet, though Lucas Moura and new boy Giovani Lo Celso have done plenty of warming up during the break. \u201cWe Liverpool faithful won\u2019t believe it\u2019s not the year until it\u2019s statistically impossible,\u201d sighs Roger Wallace, \u201cand even then may hold out for City to be disqualified by some act of God. But I must admit some nerves when City look twice as dominant against Spurs as we do against Southampton.\u201d Half-time entertainment. Our old pal Nick Ames has been to Berlin. Like Bowie, Eno and Fripp before him, he\u2019s been very creative. Enjoy. Bernardo Silva performs some ball-glued-to-boot tricks out on the right. Rose eventually clatters him for his cheek. Then Lloris nearly gifts the ball to De Bruyne, but gets away with a weak pass. And then the whistle goes. It couldn\u2019t come quickly enough for Spurs, who suddenly looked very ragged ... and not a little irritated at chasing shadows. A big half-time coming up for Mauricio Pochettino. Pep by contrast can get a cigar on. 45 min: Spurs can\u2019t get out of their final third. They\u2019re desperate to hear the half-time whistle. They\u2019ll need to get through an extra two minutes. 43 min: And once again, City nearly punish Spurs after hypnotising them with their metronomic football. The ball\u2019s suddenly slipped down the right for De Bruyne, who from the byline pulls back a pinpoint pass for Gundogan, rushing into the Spurs box. Gundogan meets it first time, and is inches away from passing the ball at speed into the bottom right. That would have been picture pretty. 42 min: City continue to stroke it around the middle of the park. Spurs are being made to do a lot of running here. 40 min: Lamela slips a long pass down the left, nearly releasing Kane. Ederson comes to the edge of his box to claim. Inches in it, but he gets to the ball ahead of the striker, and still inside his area to boot. Kane doesn\u2019t look happy, claiming for something that presumably makes sense in his imagination. He\u2019s just frustrated. It\u2019s not about Ederson, is it. 38 min: Bernardo Silva dances down the right and wedges a cross into a packed box. Easy pickings for Lloris. But the visitors are being run ragged again, after that brief mellow interlude. Such a strange rhythm to this match. 36 min: De Bruyne sashays down the inside right, past Sanchez, leaving him spinning like a teenager after three cans of warm Special Brew. He\u2019s clear in the box, with options in the middle. But he\u2019s uncharacteristically foolish, slashing a wild shot high and miles right of the target. Spurs were in all sorts of trouble for a second there. As quick as a flash, City move up a gear. Bernardo Silva slips a ball down the right to release De Bruyne into space. De Bruyne flashes a low cross to the near post, where Aguero gets a yard on Alderweireld and flicks into the bottom right! Clinical. City lulled Spurs into a false sense of security there. Hypnotic. 34 min: City try to regain some control. They stroke it around the midfield for a while. Baby steps. Then suddenly ... 32 min: It\u2019s all a bit scrappy at the moment. Such a contrast to the first 20 minutes, when City were so slick. Mauricio Pochettino will be delighted with his team\u2019s response to falling behind. 30 min: Spurs have certainly woken from their early-match slumber. They\u2019ve enjoyed nearly 60% of possession since City scored the opener. Sometimes teams need a shock to get going. \u201cI don\u2019t want VAR to start giving pens for such pathetic contact as that one, or the Tammy Abraham one in the Super Cup the other night,\u201d opines Chris G. \u201cSo if they don\u2019t, bravo I say, whilst conscious of the fact that I would never say \u2018bravo\u2019 out loud.\u201d You\u2019ll get no argument here. VAR says it best when it says nothing at all. 28 min: Ndombele slides in on De Bruyne and concedes a free kick 35 yards out, in a central position. Danger here. But City don\u2019t make the most of the opportunity, instigating a lame game of head tennis in the Spurs box. Eventually Laporte, of all people, waves a leg at a loose ball and sends it looping towards Lloris. 26 min: Nothing comes of the corner. Winks runs off down the right wing on the break, and is cynically tugged back by Sterling, who is booked for his sauce. 25 min: Sterling skedaddles down the left and plays a ball through the six-yard box. Sissoko is on hand to slice out for a corner, with Bernardo Silva lurking. Sterling has Walker-Peters on toast. So, obviously, out of nothing, Spurs equalise! In strange super-slow motion as well. Ndombele wins the ball in the centre circle and lays off to Lamela, who is allowed to stride smoothly towards the City box. Lamela takes an early shot, opening his body and passing it past an extended Ederson and into the bottom left! Simple as that! A fine finish, but where on earth did that goal come from? And why were City so passive? 22 min: That had been coming. A couple of bursts upfield apart, Spurs have been second best from the get-go. Illustrating their malaise, Harry Kane has only touched the ball on four occasions. This is such a sweet goal, yet so simple. Bernardo Silva dribbles slowly down the right, then checks and rolls a pass back up the wing for De Bruyne, who whips a vicious cross towards the back post. Sterling, rushing in, meets it with a glorious header, flush, sending the ball back across Lloris and into the right-hand portion of the net. What a move, what a finish. They\u2019re not bad, this lot, are they? 18 min: Rose takes another age over a throw. This time his stalling is so egregious that referee Michael Oliver is forced to come over and issue beneficial advice. If there\u2019s any more of this, expect the yellow card to come out. 16 min: Spurs have another drive at City. Aguero is bullied off the ball deep in Tottenham territory. That allows Kane to zip down the middle at great speed. He slips a pass wide right for Sissoko, who chips to the far stick for Lamela. A header\u2019s sent goalwards, but it\u2019s a harmless looping effort. At least City now know they\u2019re in a game. 15 min: Spurs haven\u2019t done much in attack so far. Eriksen tries to address that with a determined dribble down the middle. He nearly successfully plays a wall pass off Lamela; had it come off, he\u2019d have been scampering into the City half with Kane for company. But Lamela can\u2019t quite cushion the ball back to his team-mate. Better from Spurs, though. 13 min: In fact, that tangle looks more like a penalty every time they show it. VAR, huh, kids. 11 min: One corner leads to another. From the second, Lamela dances with Rodri, who goes down. He\u2019s after a penalty kick. He\u2019s not getting one, even though Lamela\u2019s arm was around Rodri\u2019s neck. You\u2019ve certainly seen them given, but the VAR isn\u2019t interested in overturning it. It would have been soft, but it was probably a spot kick. I guess they\u2019ll be falling back on the \u201cclear and obvious\u201d get-out. 10 min: De Bruyne, Gundogan and Sterling wreak havoc down the left. They very nearly open Spurs up with some cute triangles, but the last pass is deflected and a corner will suffice. 8 min: City look lively, but then when do they not? Sterling has a shot that\u2019s blocked and deflected out for a corner. Then after a quickly taken set piece, De Bruyne tries to thread one into the bottom right. Lloris claims. Spurs are doing their best to weather the storm, but they surely can\u2019t go on like this. 6 min: Zinchenko and Sterling combine again down the left. And once again Sterling is flagged offside. It was close, though. The Spurs back line are playing with fire. \u201cIt\u2019s good to hear that Sky are still finding new and exciting new ways to entice me to leave the TV off until kick off,\u201d writes David Flynn. You mean the MBM alone isn\u2019t enough? 5 min: Sterling nearly gets past Walker-Peters, as he twinkles down the left. Not quite. But City are coming at Spurs from all angles. The visitors have barely had a touch in these early exchanges. 4 min: City continue to pass it around relentlessly. Zinchenko nearly releases Sterling down the left, but the City winger mistimes his run and the flag goes up. 2 min: Rose takes a while over a throw, deep in Spurs territory. Clever move. Spurs started in a shaky fashion, they could do with finding their feet. And breathe. City get the big match underway! It\u2019s not long before Bernardo Silva and De Bruyne are working their way down the right, forcing Alderweireld to hack clear. Then Sterling nearly gets onto a long pass down the left, but he\u2019s ushered away from danger just when it looks as though he\u2019ll latch onto the ball. A couple of statements of intent within the first 55 seconds or so. The teams are out! A cracking atmosphere for the first game of the new season at the home of the treble-winning champions. They wear their famous sky-blue shirts, while Spurs sport their trademark lilywhite are in second-choice dark blue. Or is that purple? You get the gist. We\u2019ll be off before you know it! Sky Sports have had a chat with both managers. The main takeaway: Pep Guardiola has changed his line-up because he wants to give all his squad a run-out. \u201cI want everyone involved. I want to see the players. We need everybody. If the players don\u2019t play every game it could be two or three weeks without a game. I need to see them.\u201d By contrast, Mauricio Pochettino has opted for his strongest side without any considerations regarding rotation. \u201cIt is so important that we pick the best starting XI. City love to dominate the midfield but we are strong there.\u201d This is the second Saturday night match on Sky Sports under the new TV contract. And for some reason they\u2019ve decided to stick with the wholly unnecessary innovation of sending pundit Jamie Redknapp out onto the pitch during the warm-up to take \u201ca closer look\u201d at a couple of the players. Last week it was Tanguy Ndombele, with reference to footage he\u2019d already seen in the studio; this week it\u2019s Rodri, who was busy doing stretches 60 yards away. The long and the short of it, pretty much, is that the speck he sees in the distance is a \u201cbig unit\u201d. Yes, well, this segment doesn\u2019t work, does it. Having said that, it\u2019s only a matter of time before poor old Jamie takes a loose one right in the clock, just like his old dad before him. It\u2019s inevitable, and a possible reason why the producers are happy to keep this one going. The champions make four changes to the team named for the 5-0 win at West Ham last Saturday. Sergio Aguero, Bernardo Silva, Ilkay Gundogan and Nicolas Otamendi come in for John Stones, David Silva, Riyad Mahrez and Gabriel Jesus. Christian Eriksen returns to the Spurs starting line-up after coming on as substitute to turn around the opening-day fixture against Aston Villa. Lucas Moura makes way, the only change to Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s side. Manchester City: Ederson, Walker, Otamendi, Laporte, Zinchenko, Gundogan, Rodri, De Bruyne, Bernardo Silva, Aguero, Sterling. Subs: Bravo, Gabriel Jesus, Silva, Fernandinho, Mahrez, Joao Cancelo, Foden. Tottenham Hotspur: Lloris, Walker-Peters, Sanchez, Alderweireld, Rose, Sissoko, Winks, Ndombele, Lamela, Eriksen, Kane. Subs: Vertonghen, Dier, Lo Celso, Gazzaniga, Lucas Moura, Skipp, Davies. Referee: Michael Oliver (Northumberland). Domestic treble-winners Manchester City versus Champions League runners-up Tottenham Hotspur. It\u2019s fair to say this is a big one. We might only be nine days into the new season, but as both teams have designs on the Premier League title, this qualifies as a proper six-pointer. Sniff if you like, but there it is. City will be confident of making an early statement in their quest to join Huddersfield Town, Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United as three-peat winners of the English top division. As if sticking five past West Ham at their own gaff wasn\u2019t enough. They\u2019re currently on a 15-game winning streak in the league, and are on a four-match winning run against this evening\u2019s opponents. They\u2019ve beaten Tottenham seven times in their last nine visits. And Spurs have a dismal record against the top clubs of late: just seven points against the other members of the self-styled Big Six last year. On the flip side, that four-game winning streak of City\u2019s is a league-only affair. It doesn\u2019t include the Champions League quarter-final bedlam between the two sides last April, two matches that fair took the wind out of City\u2019s continental sail, and briefly threatened to derail their Premier League campaign, as Pep\u2019s men huffed and puffed to a one-goal win over the same opponents three days later. So Spurs are unlikely to feel too overawed, despite the overall picture. But they\u2019ll need to perform a lot better than they did during those Christian-Eriksen-free minutes against Aston Villa last weekend. Can they raise their game and give the champions a fright? Or will City keep on keepin\u2019 on? We\u2019ll find out soon enough. It\u2019s on! Kick off: 5.30pm BST.",

During the World Cup there was little comfort to be found at the Home of Cricket. Against Australia in the group stage he was trapped lbw for eight by a beautiful in-swinger from Mitchell Starc. The final with New Zealand then witnessed what Root has since described as one of the worst innings of his life: ignominiously caught behind off Colin de Grandhomme\u2019s dibbly-dobblers for a 30-ball seven as the pressure told. In the one-off Test match against Ireland it was Mark Adair who triggered the lbw glitch for eight in the first innings, while in the second Root caught behind off the same man. He had frantically charged down the pitch on 31, trying to force the issue on a surface that he would later grouse about. Fast forward to this second Ashes Test and the results read no better.

The true callousness is in intentionally bowling short, fast deliveries in the first place; a far more sensible approach would be to discourage (or ban) bowlers from that kind of bowling. In that regard, Australia are no better than anyone else; Australia are very happy to still include those deliveries in their arsenal. Cummins and Hazlewood have consistently bowled short and fast to England on Thursday and again this afternoon (including to the tailenders, less equipped to protect themselves), with Burns, Denly, Woakes and others being hit.

Unless Archer was genuinely shaken and upset, in which case the appropriate response of his teammates is to actually see if he\u2019s OK and put an arm around his shoulder and comfort him if he is not (or even if he says he is).

That Archer to Smith spell, high speed and guile against an outstanding batsman with daemons in his head, will be imprinted on many minds this evening The horrendous felling of Smith was awful to watch, and thankfully he\u2019s ok. And yet, it may have torn a hole in his protective cocoon that has worked hitherto so well this series. We must watch and wait. And after all that, England\u2019s batsmen batted through a torrid last session. Of course, it could all end in a draw - but don\u2019t miss a ball tomorrow. Phew - time for a stretch. Have a great evening everyone! And while I remember, thank you so much for all your emails and sorry I couldn\u2019t print them all. One more to finish on, from Matt Redgrave, a thoughtful reply to Damien Edgar\u2019s similarly sensitive mail. Think its all pretty valid. The Phil Hughes death hasn\u2019t changed the culture over here and we tend not to have high speed bowlers and fast wickets that often, so it is understandable that English cricket hasnt done this thinking. Time to do it now though..Also Archer was 19 when Hughes tragically died. Root as captain should guide him. I\u2019d expect a captain to head over to the Aussie camp and check he\u2019s ok and express concern. \u201cIt was a terrible blow and it looked horrible at the time but thankfully Steve is ok, \u201c says Justin Langer. Ian Ward asks whether Smith was ok to come out after his wild slog for four in the eighties and then his change of mind about the review when he was out. Langer reassures us that Smith was fine. HE then goes on to explain that Smith is one of the few players who doesn\u2019t wear a stem guard on his helmet - his personal choice, he can\u2019t feel comfortable with it. I don\u2019t really know where to start with today. Two sides going at each other with everything, divided by a piece of RICE paper, with just a day of the Test to go. Nasser Hussain: It was one of the iconic days of Test cricket. That was magnificent watching. High quality fast bowling against one of the greatest batsmen there has ever been. There was a worry for a while about Smith but he came back like the champion he is. Mike Atherton: An amazing spell of bowling and when Steve Smith was felled that added some trememdous drama from the day. Not that you ever want to see that happen. Chris Woakes: We aren\u2019t in the game to hurt people and we don\u2019t wish anyone to be injured. It wasn\u2019t nice to see but luckily it seems Steve is ok. Cummins delivers just two balls of the 33rd over, extremely wide of the crease before the clouds start to empty over Lord\u2019s. England finish an eventful, gripping day with a lead of 104 and six wickets in hand. Bravo to Stokes and Buttler for curtailing their inner dragon in the final hour. 32nd over: England 96-4 (Buttler 10, Stokes 16) Hazlewood, who has the look of thin, dark, Kiefer Sutherland replaces Lyon. He delivers a maiden. And a couple of last emails on the Archer/Smith affair. Damian Edgar is right that the world has changed since Lillee &amp; Thommo writes Timothy Sanders. But expecting the emotional development of a young fast bowler to have changed with the times seems unfair. I never had a great sense of empathy when I was Archer\u2019s age, nor indeed Buttler\u2019s; and I didn\u2019t have the awesome, scary ability that Archer has and Thommo had. And Craig from Nottingham doesn\u2019t think that any giggling/concern/non concern is the point. It\u2019s all well and good Australians putting a greater emphasis on apologising and asking whether a batter is ok after he\u2019s been hit, but by that point the damage has already been done. The true callousness is in intentionally bowling short, fast deliveries in the first place; a far more sensible approach would be to discourage (or ban) bowlers from that kind of bowling. In that regard, Australia are no better than anyone else; Australia are very happy to still include those deliveries in their arsenal. Cummins and Hazlewood have consistently bowled short and fast to England on Thursday and again this afternoon (including to the tailenders, less equipped to protect themselves), with Burns, Denly, Woakes and others being hit. Plenty of those deliveries had the potential to cause serious injuries, regardless of any subsequent apologies or concern. While Archer could have shown more concern, concern doesn\u2019t fix injuries. 31st over: England 96-4 (Buttler 10, Stokes 16) Stokes plays and misses and fiddles his bat in frustration. His tattooed upper arms poke past his short sleeves - I bet it is painful being tattooed on the inside of the upper arm, like a baby\u2019s bottom. Ah, now that\u2019s something, Cummins strays off target and Stokes turns him down to the boundary. 30th over: England 90-4 (Buttler 10, Stokes 10) Stokes is lucky to survive that over from Lyon, befuddled by two consecutive non-turning deliveries from Lyon. 29th over: England 89-4 (Buttler 10, Stokes 9) A gripping micro-contest between bat and ball. An absolute corker from Cummins has Buttler desperately poking, then he clips Cummins away with some style, a quickstep shot with a top hat and cane. 28th over: England 83-4 (Buttler 8, Stokes 9) Lyon is sweet respite at the moment. 27th over: England 78-4 (Buttler 4, Stokes 8) England\u2019s batting heroes of the World Cup final face off Cummins, pawing the ground at the top of his mark. They play out another maiden. 26th over: England 78-4 (Buttler 4, Stokes 8) Another Lyon maiden. 25th over: England 78-4 (Buttler 4, Stokes 8) As late afternoon sun settles over Lord\u2019s, Stokes attempts thekind of shot you might buy in a joke shop - but escapes, somehow, unscathed. And news - Steve Smith has not broken his arm and will be fit to bat tomorrow. 24th over: England 76-4 (Buttler 3, Stokes 7)Sweet Lord, someone explain the review system to Australia again. They don\u2019t review an lbw shout off Lyon once more, and a DRS replay shows Stokes, then on six, would have been heading back to the pavilion. 23rd over: England 75-4 (Buttler 3, Stokes 6) A maiden from Siddle Here\u2019s my hot take for the OBO, writes Sebastian Lloyd - Buttler\u2019s out of nick, replace him with Curran in the role of a batsman who can bowl a few overs. More reliable, more useful. Hopefully this means Jos gets a 60 ball hundred. That is some jinx! 22nd over: England 75-4 (Buttler 3, Stokes 6) Just a leg bye off the over, and a flurry of emails about Joe Denly, kind but questioning. If only all the England batsmen followed Denly\u2019s example and improved their Test average in both innings, they\u2019d have no problems in this match, writes Geoff Wignall. On the other hand, after a single half century in 10 innings can/ should he be perservered with? Dave Adams asks for perspective: Hope the selectors judge Denly\u2019s contributions in context. Scores of 30 and 26 might be underwhelming, but they were the hardest of hard runs - helping England to partially rebuild in both innings. 21st over: England 74-4 (Buttler 3, Stokes 6) Don\u2019t forget we\u2019ll be playing till seven tonight weather permitting... anyway, Buttler is off the mark with a tender shot through midwicket. Some rebuilding needed with some urgency. And we see Smith on the balcony, back from the hospital and somewhat dazed, but ok. An absolute cracker from Siddle that rears and spits and Burns can\u2019t take hjs bat away in time. 20th over: England 64-3 (Burns 29, Stokes 6) With two left-handers at the crease, Paine whistles up for Lyon once again. And what an over he pulls out of the bag, having Stokes prodding and poking, until off the final ball Stokes goes forward and edges to first slip where Warner.... drops him. 19th over: England 64-3 (Burns 28, Stokes 0) Stokes leapfrogs Buttler up the order and is rewarded by a leave-aloner from Siddle. Another bright start from Denly, but no cigar. The ball before he was out, he\u2019d sent Siddle to the boundary with a most gorgeous whip through mid-wicket. But that was then. Aw shucks, Denly drives straight back to Siddle who with soft hands grabs the ball in the follow through. 18th over: England 56-2 (Burns 27, Denly 19) Hazlewood is back and Denly bears the brunt, fishing inelegantly at one that was wide enough for Moses to consider parting, before pulling one just short of deep square. Lots more thoughtful emails, more than I can publish, for which apologies. First Damien Edgar from Victoria. I would say that, from the perspective of most Australian cricket fans and (I would guess) players, our perspective on seeing players get hit, particularly around the head, fundamentally changed following the death of Phil Hughes. When I\u2019m watching cricket now and someone gets hit on the head, it doesn\u2019t matter who he plays for, I feel physically sick, and that feeling lingers beyond finding out that the player is OK. And I don\u2019t think that I am alone in this. And because the death of Phil Hughes had such a massive impact on the Australian sporting psyche, I think that we imagined that it would have had a similar impact throughout the world. There have been a few occasions since then when Australian fast bowlers have hit players on the head and they have immediately been at the player\u2019s side to see if he is OK. From my perspective, it beggars belief that you would do anything different. Unless Archer was genuinely shaken and upset, in which case the appropriate response of his teammates is to actually see if he\u2019s OK and put an arm around his shoulder and comfort him if he is not (or even if he says he is). It is not going over to him and sharing a joke and a giggle with him, while the opposing batsman is still being looked over by medical staff. And it is not clear that he was OK at this time \u2013 it can take hours and sometimes days for the side effects of head and brain injuries to present, let alone a couple of minutes. Bringing up Lillee and Thommo as some sort of rebuttal is callous and redundant \u2013 we no longer live in that world. 17th over: England 54-2 (Burns 26, Denly 18) Siddle drifts wide of leg stump and the ball flies past Paine and down for four byes. I hear a shout from the other room and City have gone one-up against Tottenham - which can\u2019t be true otherwise the new footall season is happening at the same time as the second Ashes Test. That would be ridiculous. Denly edges Siddle through the slips for four and a look of intense irritation passes over Siddle\u2019s face. Stephen Davenport has an answer for Andrew Cosgrove\u2019s musings on helmets. ..there is one way to protect that spot - get it out of the way of a bouncer. It\u2019s a legitimate delivery, and I don\u2019t recall any of this hue and cry when, for example, Malcolm Marshall was unapologetically picking bits of Mike Gatting\u2019s nasal bone out of the ball. Then again, back then we didn\u2019t have the raucous bear-pit that is Twitter. 16th over: England 46-2 (Burns 26, Denly 14) From the sublime to the ridiculous in two shots. First Joe Denly frolics down the pitch to lift Lyon over mid on for four glorious runs. Then he and Burns get in a right fix running between the wickets as Burns has his head in the clouds. Still, they\u2019re still there, and that\u2019s drinks. 15th over: England 41-2 (Burns 26, Denly 9) Summat simple from Peter Siddle. 14th over: England 39-2 (Burns 26, Denly 9) Rory Burns somehow survives an over from Nathan Lyon in which he would have been out lbw had Australia reviewed, and then plays a terrible slog-sweep that is heading for Neptune before falling back down but away from the Australian fielders. HE does manage a nice square cut too, to be fair. 13th over: England 30-2 (Burns 18, Denly 8) Denly is DROPPED by David Warner at first slip off Peter Siddle. He fends and Warner overbalances as he goes for the catch and the ball tips out of his fingertips. A lucky, lucky, lucky escape. 12th over: England 27-2 (Burns 18, Denly 6) Tim Pine goes for a double change, as Nathan Lyon replaces Hazlewood at the Nursery End. Burns, awkward, unconventional Burns, rouses the crowd with a boundary, a cut. David Hinde has not time for sentiment or sacred cows. He\u2019s straight to the point, and it is hardcore. Hi Tanya. Hi David So, can we now maybe confront the elephant in the room. \u201cJoe Root is the only one of the big 4 not averaging over 50\u201d. Err. There is no big 4. It\u2019s a big 3. There have been and currently are countless batsmen whose career averages are higher than Root\u2019s. But not one of them is english. There are 2 issues here. The inability of an english batsman to sustain an average over 50. And the complete blindness of cricket journalists to the state of the averages of the latest hyped-up english batsman. This issue is ancient. It goes back 4 decades. But no one wants to discuss it. And if Moeen needs a break from all forms of cricket, what about Joe Root? 11th over: England 23-2 (Burns 13, Denly 6) Cummins is sent for a brief period of pasture and Siddle is summoned up for the cause. It\u2019s a simple acceleration process - and a simple delivery stride, no angles, nothing tricksy. No great speed either, but he\u2019s a master of his art, as anyone at Essex could testify. Anyway, he starts with a maiden. 10th over: England 23-2 (Burns 13, Denly 6) Denly gets hit in the guts at high speed by Hazlewood. We see his mouth open and his eyes screw up in slow motion. That hurt. He escapes the danger end by tucking the ball down to long leg, though respite is short as Burns takes a single off the next ball. 9th over: England 20-2 (Burns 12, Denly 4) Burns fiddles and twists - yes there are four slips behind you Rory. But he ducks a short one then knocks Cummins down to deep square leg for a couple more. At near parity with a just day to go, every run must have a value more than itself. R=r+3? 8th over: England 18-2 (Burns 10, Denly 4) Hazlewood,, ears signalling east and west as he runs in, keeping it tight, but Burns manages a run, a pull to deep square. It\u2019ll be a full house tomorrow I wager. Cheap tickets for kids in the school holidays Lord\u2019s? 7th over: England 17-2 (Burns 9, Denly 4) Cummins is bowling with fire here, but Burns and Denly survive. Denly even hits four, though without any conviction. Still, Gower has some kind words: \u201cHe\u2019s got a good rhythm to him.\u201d What an interesting situation this match is in writes Andrew Cosgrove. At tea, Sky was talking about how Smith wasn\u2019t wearing a helmet with the new extra neck protection. But I don\u2019t think that would have helped him, the ball looked like it hit him lower, and further forward. I don\u2019t see how you can protect that spot without restricting head movement too much. 6th over: England 11-2 (Burns 7, Denly 0) Hazlewood has a plan for Burns. The plan is to bounce him. He nearly has his man, with an angry short ball that has Burns in a terrible tangle, arms up by his ears, chest facing the bowler. 5th over: England 9-2 (Burns 7, Denly 0) Who would you choose to face a hat-trick ball from Pat Cummins? Joe Denly is the man at the top of your pack. He survives, hit high, too high, on the pad. Cummins finishes the over by running through him. What an over. England look like a boiled egg with cracks. A golden duck for Joe Root. He prods at the ball and feathers behind to Paine. Cummins is on a hat-trick... A leading edge from a bouncer, that squares Roy up, sends the ball high and is well caught by Cummins running backwards. One thing - I think the hands were ok. 4th over: England 9-0 (Burns 7, Roy 2) Jason - no! Those HARD HANDS push forward at Hazlewood and the ball falls a foot or so short of second slip. A nudge off the hip takes him out of the danger end. Plenty more emails on Archer/Smith: Simon Horbury has dug out a quote from the 1970s Dear Tanya You might like this quote from a fast bowler: \u201cI enjoy hitting a batsman more than getting him out. I like to see blood on the pitch.\u201d Some bloke call Jeff Thomson...think he played for Engl...oops Aussie wasn\u2019t he? 3rd over: England 8-0 (Burns 7, Roy 1) Roy is watchful, careful, all the fuls just making sure he\u2019s not in any way reck ful less. Michael Holding has noticed that the slip cordon has taken a step or two back in preparation for Roy\u2019s HARD HANDS. But there you go, the hard hands nudge the ball round the corner and off he trots to get off the mark. 2nd over: England 7-0 (Burns 7, Roy 0) Burns knocks Hazlewood through the off-side and three Aussies give chase, but it beats them all. Then he leaves a short ball in the style of Smith - dropping his hands low, but without the swat. 1st over: England 1-0 (Burns 1, Roy 0) A tight over from Cummins to start the session - a crucial one for the match and a important one for Roy - who has already been dismissed by some as not good enough for Test cricket. Steve Smith is not on the field. TMS have some details on his injury: A compression bandage was put on his left arm on the field of play, he took a pain killer and the arm was iced in the dressing room prior to him returning to the field. He is now being assessed. No mention of the neck -so I assume all is ok. Roy and Burns are on the field and Cummins has the ball. Let\u2019s go! And in the green corner: Jim Pavitt: For my money, there\u2019s been too much sanctimonious guff on Twitter regarding Archer\u2019s reaction to hitting Smith. Would Jeff Thomson or Dennis Lillie have rushed to check on a batsmen\u2019s well being having just hit them on? I don\u2019t think so. Nor would Fred Truman, Andy Roberts, Micheal Holding or any fast bowler worth their salt. and from Ed Smyth: I don\u2019t play at international level, and don\u2019t play cricket other than casually, but I play hockey at a very high level. I play in goal, and in the course of that have injured or hurt people (by accident) - I know that immediately after I\u2019ve been walked away by team mates who have done everything they can to make me smile/laugh because it\u2019s that or let me feel guilty for something that crushes me, but they know I need to stay in game mode for the rest of the match. It\u2019s not laughing at the injury, it\u2019s laughing to avoid that stressed melt down. No idea if this explanation will satisfy the baying hordes, but Archer\u2019s reaction makes sense. Oliver Atkinson has some all-round advice . After the previous email you mentioned about the reaction to Archer on twitter I searched his name on there. Lots of Aussies calling him \u201cscum\u201d and a \u201cdog\u201d. Not a good day for cricket fans showing their class this. Yes, I\u2019m not sure twitter is a place of nuance on such things. All sorts of ugly things can rear their heads. Right: So from the beginning. Marcus Voller writes: As a German who had an Australian girlfriend for some time, I became a fan of cricket. She told me that it was played by gentleman. It can no longer be called so. Seeing Mr Archer laugh and joke as a man lay perhaps out of consciousness was a horrible thing to see more even than the replays of the sickening blow to the head that Mr Smith received. An article I read had a title like \u201chow do England get this man out?\u201d. It seems that they can\u2019t, but resort to violent, dangerous bowling to incapacitated him instead. Are there sanctions for this form of behaviour, not trying to get an opponent out but trying to hurt and maim them? And then Malcolm Lamb: So you Poms can\u2019t bowl the man out fair and square so resort to trying to kill him. As for laughing at his discomfiture after being hit - twice - that\u2019s well beyond the pale. Add the booing from sections of the crowd and\u2026this is what it\u2019s come to. I might add that Smith turned a blind eye to what Warner and Bancroft were scheming - but he wasn\u2019t the instigator of the cheating. That\u2019s down to Warner and he\u2019s getting his just desserts. Time to give Smith a break wouldn\u2019t you say? Know many other batsman that can play as courageously as that? You could probably count them on one finger. What a session! Time for a quick cuppa and I\u2019ll be back to go through all those emails, I promise. Meanwhile, arise Steve Smith. Whatever his past misdeeds, he\u2019s been magnificent, courageous and the spine of his team. Cummins has a swing and gloves the ball behind. The England lead is just eight runs. Stuart Broad takes his fourth wicket of the innings. 94th over: Australia 250-9 (Hazlewood 1 , Cummins 20) There\u2019s something calming about Jack Leach. He\u2019s a cup of tea after a bad day - and there\u2019s not much better than that. The wicket, incidentally, came off the first ball of his spell. Clipping the middle of leg stump - Lyon reviewed but I\u2019m not really sure why. The ball hit him on the front pad fairly middlingly. And that is Leach\u2019s first wicket in a home Test! 93rd over: Australia 246-8 (Lyon 6 , Cummins 20) Lovely by Lyon off Broad, on the up and through the covers for a handy three. Then Cummins drives and the ball falls just short of Root at firsts slip My take on Archer\u2019s giggling, before I hit the emails ...as someone who doesn\u2019t play sport to any kind of level, I don\u2019t understand not going to check if Smith was ok. But the giggling I can understand as a kind of nervous reaction - like you might have if someone told you something terrible. 92nd over: Australia 243-8 (Lyon 3 , Cummins 20) Woakes wobbles the seam down and Cummins nudges him for four between slips. Frustration is just starting to show in Joe Root\u2019s face - after the high drama, Australia are kicking the can towards parity. 91st over: Australia 238-8 (Lyon 2 , Cummins 16) Broad keeps it tight again, in an older brother kind of way as Lyon and Cummins tick off a few precious runs. Lisa Goldacre\u2019s email pops in my inbox: Interesting email you have chosen to select. You might want to check the temperature on Twitter. Very different view of the giggling.... not cool at all Lisa I\u2019ll go through them all at tea I promise. 90th over: Australia 235-8 (Lyon 0 , Cummins 15) And amidst the drama, Australia now trail by only 23 - incidentally my lucky number. Woakes keeps it steady - I think everyone is holding on for arctic roll and a brew now. John Starbuck sounds a little exasperated We\u2019ve had this discussion about extra protection on helmets before on the OBO. You could have a modern equivalent of what used to be called an aventail on Persian-style helmets. Think Chris Gayle\u2019s shade for the back of his neck, but in a stouter material. meanwhile Stephen Morley shakes his head in despair I am ashamed to be English hearing the English Lords mob booing Smith after he returns to the field.Has the country sunk to such lows even in cricket now? I hear you Stephen. I filed something saying how great Lord\u2019s was this morning - but that made me feel sick. 89th over: Australia 235-8 (Lyon 0 , Cummins 15) Cummins is dropped by Roy at second slip off Broad - it went high and fast and he couldn\u2019t quite hold on. 88th over: Australia 234-8 (Lyon 0 , Cummins 14) A super over from Woakes, Smith had time just to edge four through slip befor being e trapped as certainly as it is possible to be trapped. After such a dramatic innings, the dismissal was almost bathos. I\u2019ve had a few emails on this topic - but here is Sandile Xaso\u2019s take from Pretoria. Loving today\u2019s play, a shame we\u2019ve two days lost to rain. I hope not too much is made of Archer and Buttler shown on screen having a giggle when Smith was down. It\u2019s clearly a nervous laugh and an attempt by a teammate to distract/cheer up Joffrey in a tense situation. Bowlers don\u2019t do it to harm anyone, but to intimidate and unsettle batsmen in order to dismiss them. Seeing highly skilled batsmen deal with highly skilled fast bowlers is one of the thrills of this sport. Smith and Archer are teammates in the IPL too, so I doubt there\u2019s any malice or ill-will. Smith walks! Then reviews, then as he sees it reviewed on the big screen, he walks again. Some complete idiots in the crowd boo. A great inswinger from Woakes which hits him on the left pad as he is squared up. 87th over: Australia 226-7 (Smith 88 , Cummins 14) In the context, you might say just a maiden from Broad that Cummins keeps out. Meanwhile Archer conspiculously warms up with a little bit of this and that. Surely not.. 86th over: Australia 226-7 (Smith 88, Cummins 14) Steve Smith - what can you say? He defends his off stump first ball. Then he steps down and slugs at Woakes over mid-on. Then next ball, more control, but same result - through the covers and over the boundary. This man is a riddle in an enigma. Mr cricket with a point to prove, an anti-hero who won\u2019t stay down. More. And less. Oh yes he does... A superb ball, moved away just a tad, and Siddle nicked it behind. 85th over: Australia 218-6 (Siddle 9, Cummins 14) Broad hits the heights of 87mph - perhaps he has a point to prove. A maiden. Technicalities resolved! Apologies, I will try and get to you all but I\u2019ll start with Brad McMillan. \u201c It hasn\u2019t been mentioned, by the OBO, TMS or Sky, but we must\u2019ve all thought it: the blow Steve Smith took was scarily similar to the one that killed Phil Hughes. It was right on the side of the neck, and I\u2019m sure there must\u2019ve been some debate about whether to show the replay at all. I\u2019m surprised the helmets haven\u2019t been improved to cover that area since the Hughes incident. I hope he\u2019s ok .\u201d Great point Brad, and I\u2019m sure we all do. As far as helmets go, I\u2019m pretty sure regulations have been changed and recommendations made - let me dig around. 84th over: Australia 218-6 (Siddle 9, Cummins 14) A maiden from Chris Woakes that finishes with an lbw appeal against Siddle that is batted away. Thanks for all the emails, at the moment I can\u2019t access them for technical reasons that I\u2019m hoping to resolve asap 83rd over: Australia 214-6 (Siddle 9, Cummins 15) Jofra gets a rest, at long last. That spell - drink it in, my friends. I expect it is imprinted in Steve Smith\u2019s dreams. Off the top of my head, comparable with Allan Donald against Michael Atherton and Michael Holding at The Oval in 1976. Four comes from Broad\u2019s over. 82nd over: Australia 214-6 (Siddle 6, Cummins 14) Woakes gets the new ball at the other end and, despite his record and career stats, it feels like light relief for the Australians. 10mph slower, for starters. Having said that, a sharp lbw appeal against Siddle is just a fraction away from being out. 80th over: Australia 214-6 (Siddle 6, Cummins 14) And the new ball goes to... Archer. He cradles the varnished cherry and sends the first two harmlessly enough down legside. Then he peppers in some bouncers,90mph plus if you don\u2019t mind, as Cummins employs some sensational backwards gymnastics to get out of danger. The final ball veers legside, past a diving Bairstow and down to the boundary. A quick statement, from the Australian dressing room says that Steve Smith is being looked at by the team doctor. 79th over: Australia 210-6 (Siddle 6, Cummins 14) Leach goes for some of the action, just a small slice, but a slice it is. He turns his second ball sharply out of the footmarks, which beats both Cummins and a surprised looking Bairstow. Siddle tickles a four and the defecit falls below fifty. 78th over: Australia 205-6 (Siddle 2, Cummins 13) Archer isn\u2019t taking any prisoners. He throws in a couple of bouncers, undaunted, Siddle survives - despite wafting rather desperately. 77th over: Australia 205-6 (Siddle 2, Cummins 13) Thanks Adam, great job. Well, that wasn\u2019t at all dramatic was it? They\u2019ve shown the replay of Smith being hit again - it was brutal. I can\u2019t believe he walked off unaided. A quiet over from Leach as we take a breath. The new ball is due in two overs. 77th over: Australia 204-6 (Cummins 13, Siddle 1) It seems barely relevant now, but the delivery before Smith hit the deck with that blow to the jaw he hooked Archer for a magnificent boundary, piercing the two men out for the shot and evading the fielder around the corner for the miscue. How will Siddle handle this? Quite well, initially, off the mark first ball with a push to mid-off, Archer failing in his diving attempt to deny the run. Cummins has two balls to deal with here. He defends the first off the back foot. 95mph! One more... and it cuts him in half! How has that missed everything?! An unforgettable passage of play. With that, I\u2019ll hand over to Tanya Aldred who will take you through to the close. Till next time! Blimey! The decision has been taken out of his hands. Smith leaves the field, walking all the way, without assistance, alongside the team doctor. He\u2019s shaking his head, he doesn\u2019t like it. But it had to be so. What a remarkable passage of Test cricket, the likes of which I have seldom witnessed before in my time following the sport. The Long Room applaud him all the way back to the dressing room. What scenes. SMITH HIT! Oh, this is not good. He\u2019s tried to hook Archer one too many times, the bouncer hitting him in the face. He\u2019s on the ground and moving around but that\u2019s as nasty as it comes. The Lord\u2019s crowd are still and silent. Surely he will have to leave the field. The medical teams from both camps are out in the middle. Smith is standing up now and talking to the Australian doctor. Surely he can\u2019t continue? DRINKS ARE ON THE FIELD, which means that that this is my mark to handover to Tanya Aldred but I might see it through to the end of this over, regardless of what happens. He doesn\u2019t want to come off. This is extraordinary. Stand by. 76th over: Australia 199-6 (Smith 76, Cummins 13) Sorry to neglect the emails for a bit, Archer and co are demanding my full attention. Leach too (Leachooooo), who is doing his job from the Nursery End. The sun has disappeared again at Lord\u2019s, it\u2019s very dark and the lights are yet to come back on. Perfect conditions for Archer to have another over. And it\u2019s Smith on strike, too... BUCKLE UP! \u201cAnthony Simmons should be reminded that upon writing to the Grauniad, he is on the international stage, and his words will be understood by all and sundry as FACT,\u201d insists Sarah Bacon. \u201cWhile I admit that I was known as \u2018Backo\u2019 (courtesy of Slammin\u2019 Sam Backo, a rugby league player from days gone by), there are plenty of Aussie nicknames which don\u2019t get that \u2018O\u2019. Warney, anyone?\u201d 75th over: Australia 198-6 (Smith 75, Cummins 13) Phwoar! It\u2019s on again. Archer nearly scones Cummins, the No8 having the presence of mind to know the full ball was coming next, lashing a square drive for four! He stays full with the third ball, beating the edge with a ripper! 94mph next up, in the vicinity of short leg but not quite. Two to go... he beats him! One to go... he beats him again! Incredible fast bowling. It doesn\u2019t come much better than this. Can he go again? 74th over: Australia 194-6 (Smith 75, Cummins 9) Leach to Cummins - it\u2019s happening, but the attention is elsewhere. Can Archer get another go at Smith to start his next set? Nup, not initially he won\u2019t. 73rd over: Australia 193-6 (Smith 75, Cummins 8) Smith has a crack at the bumper straight away! Off the edge, it\u2019s just over Bairstow and four! He goes again at the next one, hooking to long leg on the bounce! Smith gesticulates as he reaches the other end, frustrated that he didn\u2019t clear the man and pop it into the crowd! NOW A REVIEW! Has Cummins got something on Archer\u2019s next bouncer? There is an appeal, turned down by Umpire Dar but Root sends it up! Nup, it has missed by a mile. England lose their review. Cummins, still there, deflects the penultimate delivery third man giving Smith one more ball to deal with this exhilarating over... AND HE\u2019S NEARLY CAUGHT AT SHORT LEG! Off the shoulder of the bat, the ball lands no more than six inches in front of Buttler under the lid... at 96mph! We aren\u2019t going to see many better overs than that this summer. Incredible from Archer and a brave response from Smith. 72nd over: Australia 186-6 (Smith 70, Cummins 7) Cummins is the man facing this Leach over, but to be honest, we\u2019re all just waiting for Archer vs Smith up the other end. Coming up right up. \u201cHe met his match today in Archer,\u201d says Vali Jamal of Smith. \u201cMissed 2-3 balls per over. After each one he flays the bat and talks to the ball, never the bowler. Slow-motion replays would be entertaining to watch. Looks lockable and no wonder he does not talk to colleagues in the locker room. Never plays a classic forward stroke \u2013 but he\u2019s still there and will no doubt score a century and then one at least in the next four tests. Writing from Kampala Uganda and now \u201cwatching\u201d by reading here. Excellent coverage of the game and colour commentary.\u201d Thanks! A magnificent contest between these two, that\u2019s for sure. Smith to continue. The medical staff strap up his arm and he pops an arm guard on. After testing his grip on the bat, he prepares to go on... 71st over: Australia 186-6 (Smith 70, Cummins 7) SMITH HIT! Archer pings him on the arm with a short ball to finish. It\u2019s not nice at all, a ball-on-bone sound. Smith immediately throws his bat on the ground, the team doctor straight out to take a look. Earlier in the over, he clobbered him through cover with immense timing but forget about that now, can he continue his innings? Stand by. 70th over: Australia 181-6 (Smith 66, Cummins 7) Leach replaces Broad from the Nursery End, Root mixing it up to Smith. He has a short leg this time around but not a silly point. Smith gets a good stride in to take one; Cummins beaten on the inside edge from the first he faces from the tweaker, the leg before appeal turned down. \u201cTo Mr Baldwin,\u201d says Anthony Simmons on the topic of nicknames. \u201cDon\u2019t forget the Australian habit of reducing every surname with an \u201cO\u201d. Johnno, Thommo, my surname is Simmons so I was always \u201cSimmo\u201d and when my brother started at school it became \u201cBig\u201d &amp; \u201cLittle\u201d Simmo. Leacho? Broado? Archo? Let the English have full run of the language and create something better than we convicts have done. Regards, Anthony C Simmons - Big Simmo.\u201d Collo, here. 69th over: Australia 180-6 (Smith 65, Cummins 7) Sheeeesh! Archer is rapid at Cummins. He added some handy runs to start, off the mark with three through the gully. Getting the strike back from Smith, he repeated the dose with a more controlled guide over the cordon. A tad frustrated, Archer unfurls two nasty shorter balls, the first pulled in by Bairstow the second clearing the \u2018keeper at 93mph! More runs than Smith in London? Chris Wright has one on twitter: Jack Hobbs 1178 of the best Melbourne. 68th over: Australia 168-6 (Smith 64, Cummins 0) \u201cGood planning,\u201d says Nasser and he\u2019s spot on. That catch went quickly to Buttler, too. There\u2019s a buzz in the air again now at Lord\u2019s, Pat Cummins the first of the bowlers. Broad to Smith, defending early then clipping expertly, through midwicket with timing to die for. Into the 60s. Being a crucial period of play, Shane Warne spends 90 seconds talking about a television show from the 1970s. Nasser, deadpan in reply: \u201cI have absolutely no idea what you are talking about.\u201d Archer gets the breakthrough! He has the short leg in and Paine\u2019s inside edge flies straight into the hands of Buttler. They really needed that. Australia are still 96 behind. Can England get busy? 67th over: Australia 162-6 (Smith 58) 66th over: Australia 160-5 (Smith 57, Paine 23) Paine misses out on a full toss to begin the session, a genuine loosener as Nasser says on the telly. He beats Paine with one that carries down the slope but he\u2019s off strike next ball with one to mid-on. Smith\u2019s turn, who has a look at one before launching into a magnificent straight drive for four! What a way to get going after lunch. His live average is 63.51. A question from Gary Naylor as the players return to the field. \u201cWhich batsman has scored most runs in an opposition city? Bradman in London is the likeliest answer or maybe Lara in Colombo, but Smith in London must be climbing that table, with power to add today and next month at The Oval.\u201d Tendulkar, Laxman (or Hammond) in Sydney might be decent shouts as well? If you know the answer, ping it through. Stuart Broad will start the session from the Nursery End, Tim Paine the man on strike. PLAY! \u201cWoakes has completely wrecked this,\u201d asserts Vic Lanser. \u201cHe bowled a few peaches, but then stuck to short balls. These were pointless, no matter how good your Lord\u2019s average is. Wicket-to-wicket yorkers work, and if one becomes a full toss Smith can nurdle round the corner where your leg slip is. Archer\u2019s pace did worry him, although he\u2019s met Starc etc before. His lines were good, too, if a bit impatient. Broad\u2019s been his outstanding self. Hope gets a few more.\u201d I agree, Woakes was a too short. Stokes looked a chance with that extra burst of pace before lunch. I\u2019ll say it again: patience, Joe. \u201cDoes anyone know when Jags/Jagging entered the cricketing lexicon?\u201d asks Jason Ali. \u201cTogether, the terms have been used three times today, and it is not unusual to read/hear them. I have, however, been following the game since the late 1960s and am pretty sure it wasn\u2019t used then and possibly not until the turn of the millennium. Any ideas on when it first appeared and when it became accepted parlance?\u201d Anyone? I like using it. But then again, on the OBO there isn\u2019t a lot of time for selecting words. It\u2019s a stream of consciousness then submit. \u201cSmith reminds me of a line from Neville Cardus (paraphrased from distant memory) about Bradman,\u201d emails Martin Gillam, \u201cthat he symphonized batting, building an innings like an opus: looking at the scoreboard was immaterial, like judging a Beethoven symphony by following the printed score.\u201d Wouldn\u2019t mind a line like that when writing about his inevitable ton. \u201cSmith must be standing like a cricket immortal in this series by now,\u201d adds Kingsley Pearce on this theme. \u201cWhat can England do?\u201d They can\u2019t lose the plot. Give Leach a proper chance and stay patient. He isn\u2019t flawless today; this isn\u2019t that type of innings. \u201cSurely Leach\u2019s nickname should be \u2018Archie\u2019?\u201d suggests Jonathan McKinley. I\u2019ll open it up. Let\u2019s find Jack a nickname before I finish. Smooth. \u201cMay I make a late nomination in the above category for Alan Mullally,\u201d writes Mark Slater, \u201cwho all too briefly shone for England just before the Millenium. Like all left arm seamers bowling over the wicket to right handed batsmen he needed to propel the ball further to pitch on the same length as a righty and thus had a very clean and economical action. I believe he tended to be quicker than most perceived him to be, as he often got more swing on the ball after pitching than before.\u201d Very nice. We spent a lot of time talking about Alan Mullally on a podcast doco we released earlier this year on World Cup \u201899. Enjoy. \u201cUnless I missed it I\u2019m a little surprised that David Gower hasn\u2019t been mentioned,\u201d adds Kevin Sims. \u201cThe epitome of a smooth batsman surely? Never has nicking it behind been so graceful.\u201d Behind the mic, too. Let\u2019s enjoy him while still on the box this series. \u201cWe\u2019re and hour ahead and we\u2019ll into \u2018lunch\u2019 break with 32oC temperatures in shade so it\u2019s fairly liquid,\u201d brags Brian Baldwin. \u201cCan we not come up with a new format for player nicknames that simply doesn\u2019t add a \u2018y\u2019 to the surname. Butler\u2019s call to \u2018Leachy\u2019 is particularly boring. What\u2019s wrong with \u2018bloodsucker\u2019, insofar as he may drain some of Australia\u2019s venom/spirit.\u201d Especially given they\u2019ve been mates since childhood! Come on, Jos. 65th over: Australia 155-5 (Smith 53, Paine 22) Stokes does have a short leg in for this final over before lunch but Paine isn\u2019t tempted to take on the bouncer, three men back for it on the rope at fine leg, deep backward square and a conventional deep square. He does help a single in that direction without too much trouble, giving Smith the task of finishing the session off. He does so, albeit with the final delivery squaring him up nicely, but on the bounce to gully. That\u2019s lunch! One wicket for England, that of Matthew Wade (6) who edged an excellent Broad delivery from around the wicket. But these two have added 53 runs since, making 75 runs from the session. The visitors are still 103 runs behind but England really need to finish this first innings off in a hurry if they are any chance of forcing a result. With Smith still there, and beyond 50? No easy task. I\u2019ll be back in about 20 minutes for some lunch time chat. Drop me a line to join the conversation or ping me a tweet if you\u2019d prefer. 64th over: Australia 154-5 (Smith 53, Paine 21) Smith got that wallop out of his system against Leach in the previous over to lay a bit of a marker, but he won\u2019t be taking any risks with lunch so close. He defends all six accurate deliveries off the front foot here with a nice dead bat. More close catchers in there, I say. Ah well. 63rd over: Australia 154-5 (Smith 53, Paine 21) Paine has settled nicely in the half hour before lunch. Stokes nearly sorts him out with a ball that jags away but he plays it with soft hands. Good batting. 62nd over: Australia 152-5 (Smith 52, Paine 20) Smith at his ostentatious best, dancing down at Leach to take him over mid-on for a one-bounce four. After making contact, he spins the better part of 360 degree because, well, he\u2019s Steve Smith. That\u2019s his 50 as well, coming from 107 deliveries with six fours. The shot also raises the half-century stand between the pair and Australia\u2019s 150. He shows Leach plenty of respect for the rest of the over, the spinner doing as he must as we approach an interval: giving it plenty of flight. Good. \u201cIf you do put down your baby\u2019s name on the waiting list (congratulations by the way!), you\u2019re just solidifying his/her fate of growing up to become a football fan instead,\u201d says Abhijato Sensarma. Suspect they\u2019ll be both; can\u2019t imagine any other outcome. Martin Gillam has a smoothness suggestion before lunch too: \u201cOne idiosyncratic category would be smoothness of hitting - has anyone hit more effortless, sweetly timed sixes than your (near) namesake, Adam Gilchrist?\u201d No complaints here. Truly changed the game. Speaking of the footy/cricket link... 61st over: Australia 148-5 (Smith 48, Paine 20) So good from Smith, this time staying at home rather than jumping over the stumps; he knew that\u2019s where and when Stokes\u2019 full ball was coming. Don\u2019t doubt his telepathic skills. In turn, he\u2019s able to hammer it down the ground for four. Paine misses a pull shot later in the over, the third time this morning, and there is appeal as it has kept a lot lower than he thought. It\u2019s turned down and there\u2019s no review. Variable bounce? \u201cSmooth batsmen (that sounded weird in my head),\u201d writes Avitaj Mitra. \u201cI nominate Damien Martyn. Made it seem so effortless all the time. Lazy elegance is the term, I believe.\u201d Yep. Easy on the eye. And, for a while there in 2016, one of only 40-odd people in the world that Donald Trump followed on Twitter. No kidding. My dear colleague Charlie Reynolds wrote the yarn. 60th over: Australia 141-5 (Smith 41, Paine 20) Bad from Broad, Smith getting off strike - with three runs - when the big quick lets a ball through his legs at backward point. It\u2019ll be doubly frustrating for Root as the delivery before it did beat Smith\u2019s inside edge. That\u2019s the part of the bat the spinner locates when Paine is at the business end but there are no catchers in close. There really should be a couple of those for Leach early in this spell. Wickets matter, not runs, in this rain-reduced game. Give the bloke every opportunity. Lovely over. 59th over: Australia 138-5 (Smith 38, Paine 20) I was right about it being Archer\u2019s last over for now - thanks for listening, Joe. Stokes is back for a pre-lunch blast. I don\u2019t mind that. There should be a bit of reverse there for him. Oooh, he does get one to move back at Smith. Of course, he is good enough to whip it away for two but that is worth having another pop at when Paine is on strike. The bumper follows then the one that spits at Smith\u2019s gloves. He gets that bottom hand right off the blade, expertly. \u201cNothing worries him,\u201d says Sangakkara on telly. Stokes has a stare. Short of a length again to finish, Smith jumps over to grab one and keep the strike. So, Leach will get a chance at Smith for the first time. An important period. 58th over: Australia 135-5 (Smith 35, Paine 20) \u201cGo on Leachy,\u201d says YJB from behind the stumps. \u201cWobble a few down there!\u201d Yep, it\u2019s SPIN for the first time in this innings, replacing Woakes with 28 minutes remaining in the session. Paine plays each ball watchfully. \u201cTo spare Jamie H\u2019s wife\u2019s woes in learning a new cricketing-related lingo (51st over), tell him radio 4 LW reaches far far far into France, and his car should pick it up,\u201d notes Luke Brown, helpfully! \u201cI\u2019ve tested it down to beyond the Burgundy Hills (four hours south of Paris, is the max, I\u2019d say), on the way to the Alps. Fair wind etc. However, i myself am stranded (LW-wise) in Hungary, so keep the OBO coming to combat the heavy-food-and-scorching-sun afternoon-lethargy.\u201d Great to have your company. Stick with us all day long. \u201cPS - I told my infant son about the vital need for Steve Smith to be got out. He looked into my eyes, yawned, and fell asleep. I see a future for him in the pavilion.\u201d Get him on that waiting list, now! We\u2019re having a baby in February (I don\u2019t think I told you guys that? Exciting, innit?!) and the first thing I\u2019m doing when they are born: both MCC lists and Adelaide Oval. 57th over: Australia 135-5 (Smith 35, Paine 20) The last over of Archer\u2019s morning, perhaps? Nothing wrong with it, leaping one back at Paine\u2019s thigh pad along the way, but both the captain then Smith are able to keep him out. The best delivery is, once again, saved for last: a full off-cutter that Smith gets down on in the nick of time. 56th over: Australia 134-5 (Smith 35, Paine 20) Useful runs, aren\u2019t they all? Buzzzzers when Stokes takes a ping at the non-strikers\u2019 stumps, wide enough that Paine gets a couple of bonus runs. Building in confidence, the captain was also able to put away a rare poor ball from Woakes, slamming it through cover off the back foot. \u201cWhy is Jack Leach in the team?\u201d asks Aditya Kohli. I suspect he is going to be into the attack very soon. Has a major role against Smith. Love this. Mel Jones - one of the truly great cricket people. After making her maiden Ashes ton in 1998, she did the clinic circuit when returning home. Remember well her schooling us on her vicious cut shot. In short: to hell with rolling your wrists when making contact, hit down on the ball to begin and it doesn\u2019t matter. 55th over: Australia 127-5 (Smith 35, Paine 13) Paine is battling but that\u2019s what is required of him here. As Justin Langer said before the Test, they want to get bulk overs into Archer and see how effective he might be when tired. In order to do that, players like Paine need to soak up overs like this. There\u2019s a ripper to finish - isn\u2019t there always when Archer is involved? - leaping up at his handle, the captain nursing it down to the gully on the bounce. Well played. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t England bowling round the wicket to Smith, aiming yorkers at leg stump with a 3-6 field?\u201d asks Brian Withington. \u201cIt might not get him out but surely it has to disrupt his perennial method of moving across to off?\u201d I think it has to do with the fact that they tried a lot of unorthodox plans last week and turned too them far too early in Smith\u2019s innings, especially the second time around. Root said before this Test that they were going to go at him as long as they could with conventional measures. It feels like it has been working relatively well so far? 54th over: Australia 126-5 (Smith 35, Paine 12) Woakes is fuller to Paine, jagging back at him this time to find the inside edge! Close. And he does it again to finish! He\u2019s the man most likely right now. \u201cI\u2018ll see your Keith Arthurton and raise you a Carl Hooper,\u201d says Hary Naylor. \u201cNobody hit sixes more smoothly than Super Hoops.\u201d The answer to a top quiz question as well. I\u2019ll get this wrong, but it goes something like... Hooper is the only man (other than Kallis?) to have played 100 Tests, 100 ODIs, taken 100 catches in both formats, snagged 100 wickets in both formats. Anyway, it\u2019s a good\u2019un when asked properly. And yes, boy, could he give the ball a wallop. 53th over: Australia 121-5 (Smith 34, Paine 8) Smith edges Archer\u2019s... slower ball? 76mph flashes up after the ball trickes into the cordon, deflected there with soft enough hands. He can put his bat away for the middle portion of the over, leaving and swaying, but misses a beauty to finish, so close to cutting him in half, jagging past his inside edge. Two busy overs since the drinks break. 52nd over: Australia 121-5 (Smith 34, Paine 8) Woakes beats Smith with a good\u2019un. That\u2019s why he takes so many wickets on this ground - gorgrous shape. Ooh, he goes the other way to Paine - a big shout for leg before... turned down. No review; going over the top. He the beats Paine with another outswinger to finish the excellent set. \u201cTo broaden the smoothness debate from bowling to batting: a mate of mine once found himself bowling to Keith Arthurton in a charity match,\u201d recalls Boris Starling. \u201cHis first ball was on a length outside off. Arthurton nonchalantly leaned into the cover drive and purred the single word \u2018smoooothness\u2019 as the ball sped to the boundary.\u201d Oh yes, a name from my childhood there. Yes, Australian fans feared all the usual suspects in that West Indian line-up but Arthurton was as classy as any of them at his 1992-93 peak. 51st over: Australia 120-5 (Smith 33, Paine 8) Archer is swung around to the pavilion end, as he was yesterday for that fierce spell at Bancroft. He doesn\u2019t take long to make the ball talk, four byes added when a ball goes down the slope and deviates too far from Bairstow to glove. For the second time since his arrival, Paine tries to pull the big quick but ends up in a tangle. Might put that shot away for now, skip. Smith pushes a single to keep the strike. DRINKS! If only we had two days after this and not one, this Test would be perfectly positioned. But there\u2019s still enough time - just. \u201cLong time listener, first time caller.\u201d We love those, Jamie Hudson. Welcome. \u201cLong drive home today through France. Enjoying the coverage. Long suffering wife reading out updates while I drive (also typing this). She describes it as similar to trying to read aloud in an unfamiliar foreign language- difficult to know where to put the emphasis when you don\u2019t know what the sentences mean!\u201d 50th over: Australia 114-5 (Smith 32, Paine 7) The Lord\u2019s Specialist, Chris Woakes, on to replace Archer from his preferred Nursery End. He picked up Khawaja yesterday at an important time, the second wicket in the space of three balls. Smith missed out on a flick through the onside, much to his frustration. He does get one to mid-on, Paine then glancing a single before the former captain finishes with two behind point along the carpet. He\u2019s into the 30s and has faced 75 balls. His average when reaching 50 deliveries in the middle is 100-plus, I\u2019m sorry to report to those desperate to see his back. 49th over: Australia 110-5 (Smith 29, Paine 6) The sun is back. It\u2019s that kind of morning; light and shade. Broad hoops an inswinging yorker at Smith, nearly castling him. He gets his bat down at the last possible moment. So cose. Paine then gets a couple through point from another delivery aimed in towards the stumps. Great spell, this. 48th over: Australia 107-5 (Smith 28, Paine 4) Smith pushes Archer to mid-on to begin, putting Paine in the firing line for the first time at this end. The skipper tries to pull but isn\u2019t quick enough, edging into his pad - where is the short leg? Not there. But he keeps his cool, deflecting the next with soft hands well behind point for four to get off the mark. Australia are still 151 behind, it is worth remembering. 47th over: Australia 102-5 (Smith 27, Paine 0) Broad at the fresh man Paine, the captain having to defend on the line of his off stump four times before he\u2019s given the chance to shoulder arms. Full and straight, Broad isn\u2019t mucking around. Three maidens on the trot. 46th over: Australia 102-5 (Smith 27, Paine 0) It is dark again at Lord\u2019s, the lights on full with Archer starting his fresh set. As I noted before, credit his way as well for Wade\u2019s wicket, hitting him twice in his two previous overs. At Smith this time, he goes well beyond his outside edge playing off the back foot. Dangerous areas. Smith then has a pop at one that he would normally leave well alone, the bowler again winning the mini-battle. This is good stuff. The bouncer to finish is followed by Smith\u2019s eyes all the way into Bairstow\u2019s gloves, prompting more giggles. Find a telly, this is great entertainment. 45th over: Australia 102-5 (Smith 27, Paine 0) Broad has been rewarded for bowling such a full length - as Nasser Hussain notes on telly, fuller than at any stage in his career. As someone clever noted in the press box last week, professional athletes usually have to improve quite a lot at Broad\u2019s age to stay relevant and that\u2019s precisely what he\u2019s done ahead of this summer. Paine is the new man, getting a nasty one to begin that jumps at his handle, the captain ripping his hand off the bat. He hates those, given the number of finger operations he\u2019s required. Wicket maiden. Fantastic bowling! Broad brings Wade forward from around the wicket, tailing away from the left-hander. He finds the edge, just carrying to Burns at third slip. An excellent low catch. Wade, who looked so good before Archer roughed him up, is on his way. 44th over: Australia 102-4 (Smith 27, Wade 6) Ouch, Archer hits Wade again this time - this time on the shoulder. Smith dealt with him easily enough before taking one to mid-on, watching carefully. 43rd over: Australia 100-4 (Smith 26, Wade 6) Smith is making a habit of scoring behind square early in the over, helping Broad in that direction for Australia\u2019s 100th run. Warm applause from the packed Lord\u2019s crowd - they love their Saturdays at HQ. Wade is forced to use his bat in defence until the final ball, Broad from around the wicket hooping back a long way; not far from that off-stump with the No6 shouldering arms. Top notch cricket so far. \u201cSat in Jakarta airport after a combined 16 hours in transit,\u201d Harry Coleman reports to me on twitter. \u201cCan\u2019t speak to much really but how about that The Shape of Water, hey? My vote for smoothest action goes to the big charming fish man.\u201d Slept in the bath, you say, Smithy? Norwegian Wood, then. 42nd over: Australia 99-4 (Smith 25, Wade 6) Archer it is, replacing Stokes after just a couple of overs. He\u2019s full to Smith immediately, clipping one to fine leg. Wade has to be right on it, under an accurate bumper then directing into his body at 90mph. He\u2019s good enough to keep him out. Ooh, the last ball is a nasty one, hitting Wade on the fingers. He takes his glove off between overs to give his hand a shake. He hasn\u2019t called for the medical staff, so that\u2019s a good sign. 41st over: Australia 98-4 (Smith 24, Wade 6) Broad and Smith are both in the game here; a fantastic contest emerging early on this fourth day. To begin, the Australian hammers him through cover off the back foot for the second time so far - there wasn\u2019t much wrong with that ball, either. The England attack-leader bounces back with the second delivery of the morning that\u2019s good enough to beat Smith. A beauty, seaming up the slope. When Wade gets his turn, he drives a full delivery with lovely timing, beating mid-off. With it, the Tasmanian reaches 1000 Test Match runs. Nine off the over. \u201cIf Jardine were in charge he would place two very short legs in place (perhaps Stokes and Woakes) and thereby prevent Smith doing his waddle out to short leg,\u201d suggests Will Buckley. \u201cGet in his head, muck up his OCD routine and watch his mind unravel.\u201d 40th over: Australia 89-4 (Smith 19, Wade 2) Probing over from Stokes, well watched initially by Wade who is later able to dig out a yorker down for one. Smith is happy enough jumping across his woodwork for another single to finish, tucking to fine leg. \u201cMorning Adam.\u201d G\u2019day, Kim Thonger. \u201cSorry to start the day in disagreement but on the question of smoothness, everyone else is wrong. Tom Cartwright had by far the smoothest action and only missed out on more Test cricket because of moronic selection policy. Not a recent development obvs.\u201d How about Jofra bowling 94mph bumpers yesterday? Doesn\u2019t the radar slow most bowlers down when they dig in short? More! More! 39th over: Australia 87-4 (Smith 18, Wade 1) Smith beaten! Broad goes past his blade with his first ball of the morning - dare I say, a nervous prod? Sure enough, the former captain is furious at himself and shifts into light-sabre mode as the sun comes out from behind the clouds. What a glorious sight. Just on Smith\u2019s odd habits when leaving the ball, he doesn\u2019t do it all the time. As he\u2019s explained when I\u2019ve asked him about it before, this is a clue that he\u2019s trying to shift into his highest level of concentration. With a bit of width, he pushes a boundary with ease through point off the back foot; so much time, lovely batting. He then defends the final ball and kicks his legs up like he\u2019s setting up to take a diving catch - the crowd laugh as one. \u201cSurplus energy,\u201d says Ian Botham. Something like that. 38th over: Australia 82-4 (Smith 14, Wade 1) Ahh, that\u2019s right: Ben Stokes had five balls remaining when the rain arrived two minutes before the lunch break yesterday. The first of those is to Wade, who clips one to get off the mark from the 24th ball he has faced. The Tasmanian did very nicely in tough conditions yesterday, reinforcing that his technique is a lot tighter than during his previous stints as a Test player. Smith\u2019s turn and Stokes gets one to spit off a length, the Aussie master forced to rip his bottom hand off the blade. It doesn\u2019t bother him too much though, getting his first run of the day from the next delivery, tucked neatly behind square. Good morning to you all! Thanks, JP! The players are on the field, Ben Stokes to begin from in front of my position at the Nursery End. Wade is the man on strike. We have 196 overs remaining in this Test Match. Bring it on. PLAY! Right, the players are making their way out to the middle so it\u2019s time for me to stand aside and let Collo have an uninterrupted view of the middle. Thanks for having me, see you again tomorrow. We\u2019re now just five minutes from the resumption of play. That means you should start sending your emails and tweets Adam Collins\u2019s way because I will soon be off to put my feet up. Yes please! Andersonwatch update: \u201cRichard Hadlee was the smoothest of all, surely,\u201d emails Mike Herd, \u201cwith a word for Mike Hendrick too.\u201d Just ten minutes or so until play resumes. Can England dismiss Smith cheaply and send a shockwave through the Australian dressing room? Here we go, Bharathan knows his Onions. Raymond Reardon (not that one), has turned up with the lols. \u201cSmith, Warner and Bancroft would be the three smoothest woodworkers for using a fine 180 grit.\u201d Thomas Hopkins likes a bit of rough. \u201cI may be swimming against the tide here, but I rather enjoy a lack of smoothness, Jasprit Bumrah a current favourite player. There\u2019s something delightfully contrary about his action.\u201d When we talk smooth bowling actions we\u2019re naturally drawn to pace, but what about SK Warne? Has there been a more fluid action in the game? Steve Smith doing Steve Smith things... Because we change writers during the day we will often receive emails intended for the person on deck long after we\u2019ve logged off. Sometimes these provide obvious clues about what was being discussed in our absence, like Scott Roberts\u2019s email titled \u201cGetting Smith out\u201d. (His answer, by the way, is \u201cdecide how we\u2019re trying to get Smith out and stick to that plan\u201d.) But on other occasions it is frankly impossible to imagine what on earth was going on. This morning, for example, I logged on to find an email from David Baker with the message \u201cThe Communards, Don\u2019t leave me this way.\u201d No idea what it was related to, but it\u2019s a banger. A lovely interjection from Mr Naylor. Agree with a lot of this. Here\u2019s an Allan Donald masterclass. Frantic yet smooth makes me think of the scene in 24 Hour Party People where Martin Hannett wants Joy Division to play \u201cfaster but slower\u201d. Caddick was a beauty though. Very repeatable and consistent, but smoother than Archer? If there\u2019s cricket news about Ali Martin will sniff it out. Like confirmation Olly Stone will miss the rest of the Ashes through injury. Overseas? Want to listen to TMS but can\u2019t find it on your dial? Try this link, courtesy of Peter Crees. \u201cI put forward Shane Bond in the smooth action category,\u201d nominates Avitaj Mitra. \u201cA pity his career was wrecked with injuries. The stats don\u2019t do justice to the kind of bowler he was.\u201d Superb bowler, but for me anyway not in the same class as someone like Holding for smoothness. Bond\u2019s action is all about the effort in the snap of the delivery stride. Curtley\u2019s a nice shout. I used to love how his smooth action concealed a Pythagorean use of angles. Here\u2019s your day four deck. Will it prove treacherous enough to snare ten Englishmen or 16 Australians in the next two days? John Starbuck is quickest off the mark in the daily email race. Attracted to the blog by the lure of smooth. \u201cMichael Holding, Malcolm Marshall and Richard Hadlee are top of my list,\u201d John emails. \u201cWe shall have to wait a season or two before Jofra Archer finds his correct place in the Dean Martin Stakes.\u201d Three superb bowlers, each with very different actions. For pure smooth though I\u2019m leaning towards Holding. Andy Bull had the pleasure of filing his column on Jofra Archer. Question: where does Archer\u2019s action rank on the all-time smoothness scale? We can have subcategories for contemporary and all-time comparison. Weather: The headline news is the forecast is dry for the remainder of the Test. Aside from that it should be around 20C for most of today but there\u2019s a stiff south-westerly which should keep everyone in Lord\u2019s on their toes. Already forgotten what happened yesterday? Fear not because Vic Marks didn\u2019t miss a thing. This paragraph in particular captures the state of play. That outcome is still by no means guaranteed, however, and the captains will ensure none of the players is seduced into concluding the draw is inevitable \u2013 and with good reason. In the 21st century batsmen are less adept at batting out for a draw and there are still 196 overs available in the second Ashes Test. That\u2019ll do. Hello everybody and welcome to the fourth day of the second Test from Lord\u2019s. The good news is the rain has cleared and we\u2019re set for a full day\u2019s play. The bad news is, frankly, all over the place right now so let\u2019s not dwell on that half of the aphorism and just enjoy the cricket, like this 24 carat nugget of pure joy. If that didn\u2019t make you smile you\u2019ve got a brick for a heart and we can\u2019t be friends. I\u2019ll be with you for the next hour or so but once play begins Adam Collins will shower you in text. If you want to join in this pre-play fun you can drop me an email or a tweet.",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s Friday night at the Edinburgh fringe. Artists are running all over town, weaving around drunk punters and through flooded streets to make their guest spots. In full drag is me, dragging a tent through the rain, my wig swiftly uncurling. I arrive 15 minutes before I am supposed to go on stage, as a guest in someone else\u2019s show. Up there already is a comedian reading from a yellow piece of paper. Next up, a man walks on stage and reads from a white piece of paper. Then it\u2019s my turn: while using two audience volunteers, I spend four minutes erecting a tent while altering the lyrics to a popular ballad, singing live, ad-libbing jokes, wearing a full face of makeup, heels and a wig, all while reinterpreting Susan Sontag\u2019s wondrous (and perhaps problematic) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/16/against-interpretation-susan-sontag-100-best-nonfiction-books\">Notes on Camp</a>.

She woke the next morning in a kimono that wasn\u2019t hers, with soreness on her inner thighs. \u201cI felt we had had sex,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew. I know.\u201d</p> <p>She gathered her things and fled while Brunel spoke on the telephone in the living room, she said. Her modelling work never recovered and she embarked on a career in television, always behind the camera.</p> <p>At the time, Huisman said, she told her boyfriend she encountered a \u201cterrible guy\u201d in Paris, but did not reveal more. Her mother had died years earlier and she did not want to tell her father, who was already skeptical about her modelling.</p> <p>\u201cI was really ashamed,\u201d she said. Huisman said she began telling her current partner about the incident eight years ago. He confirmed to the Guardian she then told him she was \u201cmolested\u201d by someone at her modelling agency, and added more details \u2013 including Brunel\u2019s name \u2013 over time, explaining the full story about two years ago.</p> <p>An American former model, now 55, spoke on condition of anonymity because her work continues to overlap with the modelling industry. She said Brunel assaulted her outside Paris, having scouted her in the US in 1984.</p> <p>The woman recalled finding herself alone with Brunel during a night out, after he led her to believe they were going to meet other people.</p> <p>She estimated Brunel drove them from Paris in a \u201creal fancy car\u201d for approximately 45 to 60 minutes before they arrived at a grand estate with big iron gates. She believes, but is not sure, they were in Fontainebleau, approximately 35 miles south-east of the capital.</p> <p>\u201cHe got undressed, put on a toweling robe and took a shower,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI thought, \u2018What am I going to do?

I kept trying to talk to him and say, \u2018Why are you doing this? I don\u2019t want to do this.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The former model said she escaped by climbing out of a window on to a ledge, and remained there for the rest of the night while Brunel slept inside. She remembered she was wearing a flannel shirt in green and black checks.</p> <p>She gave up modelling not long after that, she said, and returned to her home state in the western US, where she remains today. \u201cI thought to myself, \u2018Well this is it then, it\u2019s a horrible business\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel safe.\u201d</p> <p>The former model said she gave a full account of the incident to her roommate, whom she and the Guardian have made efforts to contact without reply. She also said she told an aunt who visited her in Paris soon afterward but died in recent years. She chose not to tell her parents as they would have been \u201cdevastated\u201d at having put her in the situation, she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5ff416814833d34b87e75d95b31c54349c3ff577\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ff416814833d34b87e75d95b31c54349c3ff577/0_0_2504_3589/698.jpg\" alt=\"Courtney Soerensen as a young model in the early 1990s.\" width=\"698\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Courtney Soerensen as a young model in the early 1990s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtney Soerensen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Courtney Soerensen was 19 when she went to Paris in April 1988 from her home town of Stoneboro, Pennsylvania.

Following a tearful call to her US agency, she said, she was spirited out of Brunel\u2019s home one night by people from another French firm and hidden for three days.</p> <p>\u201cIf someone touched one of my daughters like that now, I would call it molestation,\u201d she said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If someone touched one of my daughters like that now, I would call it molestation</p> <footer> <cite>Courtney Soerensen</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Soerensen first publicly accused Brunel more than 30 years ago, in an interview broadcast for a story titled American Girls In Paris on CBS\u2019s news magazine show 60 Minutes. Then, too, she alleged she had lost work after rejecting Brunel\u2019s advances.</p> <p>CBS has for years declined to release a recording or transcript of the December 1988 story, which was the subject of legal threats. This week Kevin Tedesco, a spokesman for the program, said: \u201cThat story is still on legal hold.\u201d</p> <p>Despite a brief flurry of controversy over the CBS story, Brunel\u2019s career continued to thrive. But he faced resentment from peers upset by his alleged mistreatment of models, according to Michael Gross\u2019s 1995 book Model: The Ugly Business of Beautiful Women.</p> <p>Jerome Bonnouvrier, a French modelling impresario who died in 2009, told Gross: \u201cJean-Luc is considered a danger.\u201d Even John Casablancas, the late modelling guru who was himself accused of sexually abusing models, told Gross: \u201cI really despise Jean-Luc as a human being for the way he\u2019s cheapened the business.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>\u2018The guy was a vile pig\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Brunel took over Karin Models and in 1995 expanded into the US. Joey Hunter, a veteran American agent, agreed to go into business with him in New York. \u201cIt was the biggest mistake of my life,\u201d said Hunter, who sold his stake and quit after two years, sick of Brunel.</p> <p>While shuttling between Manhattan and Miami, Brunel got to know Epstein, then flush with cash after taking over the financial affairs of Leslie Wexner, chairman of Victoria\u2019s Secret lingerie, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/08/victorias-secret-billionaire-says-jeffrey-epstein-stole-46m-of-his-money-report\">in an arrangement that has puzzled analysts</a>.</p> <p>Brunel lived for a while in an apartment in Trump Tower, but moved out in 1999. The New York Post reported he was forced to leave \u201cbecause of late-night carousing with beautiful women\u201d. Brunel denied this, saying the rent was too high.</p> <p>From 2000 to 2005, Brunel took at least two dozen flights on Epstein\u2019s private jet, according to flight records released to court, travelling to the Bahamas, the British Virgin Islands and elsewhere. Early on, Brunel\u2019s full name was entered in the manifest alongside the initials of regulars such as \u201cGM\u201d for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/16/ghislaine-maxwell-seen-in-public-for-first-time-since-epstein-death\">Epstein\u2019s close friend Ghislaine Maxwell</a>.

The girls who didn\u2019t, he would tell bookers: \u2018I don\u2019t want her booked for anything\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>In 2005, Brunel transformed Karin\u2019s US division into MC2, opening offices in New York and Miami. Speculation spread that Epstein had helped found the new firm. Epstein and MC2 denied they had any business relationship.</p> <p>Yet in a sworn statement in 2010, MC2\u2019s former bookkeeper said Epstein had guaranteed a $1m line of credit for MC2, and directly paid for the visas of models brought to the US to work for the company.</p> <p>The bookkeeper, Maritza Vasquez, said Brunel and models as young as 13 lived in apartments controlled by Epstein on Manhattan\u2019s East 66th Street. Despite Epstein not charging rent, Brunel billed the models $1,000 a month, Vasquez said.</p> <p>Roberts Giuffre, the Epstein accuser, alleged in a 2014 court filing that the system was a cover for sex trafficking. Brunel \u201cwould offer the girls \u2018modelling\u2019 jobs\u201d, it said. \u201cMany of the girls came from poor countries or impoverished backgrounds, and he lured them in with a promise of making good money.\u201d</p> <p>One girl said to have come to New York through this scheme was 14-year-old Nadia Marcinkova. Police files from the original Epstein inquiry said he boasted to another victim that Marcinkova was his \u201csex slave\u201d, purchased from her parents in the former Yugoslavia. \u201cShe never actually even worked as a model,\u201d Vasquez said. Marcinkova did not respond to requests for comment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7d75a7952746ef7ae38bacae4d7249231b508761\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d75a7952746ef7ae38bacae4d7249231b508761/0_184_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A 2017 photo provided by the New York state Sex Offender Registry shows Jeffrey Epstein.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A 2017 photo provided by the New York state Sex Offender Registry shows Jeffrey Epstein.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Memos of phone calls kept by Epstein\u2019s domestic staff in Florida show Brunel would call with cryptic-sounding messages \u201cHe has a teacher for you to teach you Russian,\u201d said the note of one Brunel call for Epstein in April 2005. \u201cShe is 2 x 8 years old not Blonde.

      "bodyText": "On a hot Friday evening in France last month, Jean-Luc Brunel was revelling in his natural habitat: a lavish party packed with the rich and beautiful. Dressed all in white, the 72-year-old model scout mingled beside the pool at the Paris Country Club\u2019s $1,300-a-table Soir\u00e9e Blanche, as a rock-and-roll band played, pink champagne flowed and a chef grilled rib-eye steaks over a flame. Then came the hangover. The following day, FBI agents swooped on Brunel\u2019s old friend Jeffrey Epstein at an airport in New Jersey, arresting the disgraced money manager on new federal charges of child sex trafficking. It was an alarming development for Epstein associates, such as Brunel, who are accused of aiding his abuse \u2013 and a flicker of hope for women who have been waiting years for the Frenchman to be held accountable. Virginia Roberts Giuffre, a longtime Epstein accuser, alleged in court filings that teenage girls brought to the US by Brunel on model visas were \u201cfarmed out\u201d by him to Epstein and others for sex. She also alleged she was made to have sex with Brunel several times in Epstein\u2019s homes. Brunel denies both allegations. For more than 10 years, Epstein\u2019s enablers were presumed to be shielded from legal peril by his notorious 2007 plea deal\u2019s promise that he and \u201cany potential co-conspirators\u201d would avoid further charges after Epstein admitted that he solicited prostitution from a minor. Several associates have, however, come under renewed scrutiny from US investigators, according to sources familiar with the inquiry, even as the renewed effort to bring Epstein to justice was derailed last week when the 66-year-old died of apparent suicide in a New York jail cell. Allegations of misconduct against Brunel date back decades, yet he has faced no action. Three former models told the Guardian they were sexually assaulted by Brunel in the 1980s and 1990s in and around Paris, where he established himself as one of the global fashion industry\u2019s power players. Brunel and his attorney did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement to the Guardian in 2015, Brunel vehemently denied involvement, \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d, in Epstein\u2019s crimes. \u201cI strongly deny having committed any illicit act or any wrongdoing in the course of my work as a scouter or model agencies manager,\u201d he said. While several Epstein allies disappeared from public view in the years following his now-notorious plea deal, Brunel continued traversing the globe in search of young women and girls to make into models. MC2, the Miami-based model agency Brunel founded with financial help from Epstein, did not respond to questions and multiple requests for comment. The company, which denied any connection to Epstein\u2019s crimes, has previously said Brunel was no longer actively working there. But Brunel said in a 2015 legal case, which remains open, that he still owned MC2.

Like almost being paralysed. I heard the sound of my blouse \u2013 a black blouse \u2013 ripping. I had a black skirt, too. I felt him \u2013 this is difficult \u2013 between my legs. Pushing.\u201d Huisman said the rest was a blur. She woke the next morning in a kimono that wasn\u2019t hers, with soreness on her inner thighs. \u201cI felt we had had sex,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew. I know.\u201d She gathered her things and fled while Brunel spoke on the telephone in the living room, she said. Her modelling work never recovered and she embarked on a career in television, always behind the camera. At the time, Huisman said, she told her boyfriend she encountered a \u201cterrible guy\u201d in Paris, but did not reveal more. Her mother had died years earlier and she did not want to tell her father, who was already skeptical about her modelling. \u201cI was really ashamed,\u201d she said. Huisman said she began telling her current partner about the incident eight years ago. He confirmed to the Guardian she then told him she was \u201cmolested\u201d by someone at her modelling agency, and added more details \u2013 including Brunel\u2019s name \u2013 over time, explaining the full story about two years ago. An American former model, now 55, spoke on condition of anonymity because her work continues to overlap with the modelling industry. She said Brunel assaulted her outside Paris, having scouted her in the US in 1984. The woman recalled finding herself alone with Brunel during a night out, after he led her to believe they were going to meet other people. She estimated Brunel drove them from Paris in a \u201creal fancy car\u201d for approximately 45 to 60 minutes before they arrived at a grand estate with big iron gates. She believes, but is not sure, they were in Fontainebleau, approximately 35 miles south-east of the capital. \u201cHe got undressed, put on a toweling robe and took a shower,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI thought, \u2018What am I going to do? There\u2019s no one here. I don\u2019t even know where we are.\u2019 \u201cHe kept being all over me, and I was trying to fight him off. He was grabbing my breasts and my crotch. I kept trying to talk to him and say, \u2018Why are you doing this? I don\u2019t want to do this.\u2019\u201d The former model said she escaped by climbing out of a window on to a ledge, and remained there for the rest of the night while Brunel slept inside. She remembered she was wearing a flannel shirt in green and black checks. She gave up modelling not long after that, she said, and returned to her home state in the western US, where she remains today. \u201cI thought to myself, \u2018Well this is it then, it\u2019s a horrible business\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel safe.\u201d The former model said she gave a full account of the incident to her roommate, whom she and the Guardian have made efforts to contact without reply. She also said she told an aunt who visited her in Paris soon afterward but died in recent years. She chose not to tell her parents as they would have been \u201cdevastated\u201d at having put her in the situation, she said. Courtney Soerensen was 19 when she went to Paris in April 1988 from her home town of Stoneboro, Pennsylvania. In an interview, she said Brunel subjected her to several incidents of unwanted touching, pestered her for sex and \u201csabotaged\u201d her career when she rejected him. \u201cHe would get very handsy, start groping me, try to kiss me, try to get me to lay down on the bed just to \u2018try it out\u2019,\u201d said Soerensen, who now lives in California. \u201cHe would try to untuck my shirt, wanting to \u2018see my abs\u2019. He would grab my breasts and put his hand on my bottom. There was one time where he rubbed himself up against me.\u201d Soerensen said modelling work dried up when she pushed Brunel away a final time. Following a tearful call to her US agency, she said, she was spirited out of Brunel\u2019s home one night by people from another French firm and hidden for three days. \u201cIf someone touched one of my daughters like that now, I would call it molestation,\u201d she said. Soerensen first publicly accused Brunel more than 30 years ago, in an interview broadcast for a story titled American Girls In Paris on CBS\u2019s news magazine show 60 Minutes. Then, too, she alleged she had lost work after rejecting Brunel\u2019s advances. CBS has for years declined to release a recording or transcript of the December 1988 story, which was the subject of legal threats. This week Kevin Tedesco, a spokesman for the program, said: \u201cThat story is still on legal hold.\u201d Despite a brief flurry of controversy over the CBS story, Brunel\u2019s career continued to thrive. But he faced resentment from peers upset by his alleged mistreatment of models, according to Michael Gross\u2019s 1995 book Model: The Ugly Business of Beautiful Women. Jerome Bonnouvrier, a French modelling impresario who died in 2009, told Gross: \u201cJean-Luc is considered a danger.\u201d Even John Casablancas, the late modelling guru who was himself accused of sexually abusing models, told Gross: \u201cI really despise Jean-Luc as a human being for the way he\u2019s cheapened the business.\u201d \u2018The guy was a vile pig\u2019 Brunel took over Karin Models and in 1995 expanded into the US. Joey Hunter, a veteran American agent, agreed to go into business with him in New York. \u201cIt was the biggest mistake of my life,\u201d said Hunter, who sold his stake and quit after two years, sick of Brunel. While shuttling between Manhattan and Miami, Brunel got to know Epstein, then flush with cash after taking over the financial affairs of Leslie Wexner, chairman of Victoria\u2019s Secret lingerie, in an arrangement that has puzzled analysts. Brunel lived for a while in an apartment in Trump Tower, but moved out in 1999. The New York Post reported he was forced to leave \u201cbecause of late-night carousing with beautiful women\u201d. Brunel denied this, saying the rent was too high. From 2000 to 2005, Brunel took at least two dozen flights on Epstein\u2019s private jet, according to flight records released to court, travelling to the Bahamas, the British Virgin Islands and elsewhere. Early on, Brunel\u2019s full name was entered in the manifest alongside the initials of regulars such as \u201cGM\u201d for Epstein\u2019s close friend Ghislaine Maxwell. But by the end of the period, he was familiar enough to go by \u201cJLB\u201d. Clayton Nelson, a photographer and scout who worked for Brunel at Karin around that time, said he was horrified by Brunel\u2019s treatment of women. \u201cThe guy was a vile pig,\u201d said Nelson. \u201cThe girls who slept with him worked. The girls who didn\u2019t, he would tell bookers: \u2018I don\u2019t want her booked for anything\u2019.\u201d In 2005, Brunel transformed Karin\u2019s US division into MC2, opening offices in New York and Miami. Speculation spread that Epstein had helped found the new firm. Epstein and MC2 denied they had any business relationship. Yet in a sworn statement in 2010, MC2\u2019s former bookkeeper said Epstein had guaranteed a $1m line of credit for MC2, and directly paid for the visas of models brought to the US to work for the company. The bookkeeper, Maritza Vasquez, said Brunel and models as young as 13 lived in apartments controlled by Epstein on Manhattan\u2019s East 66th Street. Despite Epstein not charging rent, Brunel billed the models $1,000 a month, Vasquez said. Roberts Giuffre, the Epstein accuser, alleged in a 2014 court filing that the system was a cover for sex trafficking. Brunel \u201cwould offer the girls \u2018modelling\u2019 jobs\u201d, it said. \u201cMany of the girls came from poor countries or impoverished backgrounds, and he lured them in with a promise of making good money.\u201d One girl said to have come to New York through this scheme was 14-year-old Nadia Marcinkova. Police files from the original Epstein inquiry said he boasted to another victim that Marcinkova was his \u201csex slave\u201d, purchased from her parents in the former Yugoslavia. \u201cShe never actually even worked as a model,\u201d Vasquez said. Marcinkova did not respond to requests for comment. Memos of phone calls kept by Epstein\u2019s domestic staff in Florida show Brunel would call with cryptic-sounding messages \u201cHe has a teacher for you to teach you Russian,\u201d said the note of one Brunel call for Epstein in April 2005. \u201cShe is 2 x 8 years old not Blonde. Lessons are free and you can have 1st today if you call.\u201d Then the authorities caught up. Acting on a tip-off, police in Palm Beach arrested Epstein. Brunel later said in a court filing that he \u201cwent to Europe and Asia for a period of time\u201d because Epstein ordered him to leave Florida to avoid having to give testimony. In a deal that would later provoke outrage, Epstein spent just 13 months in a Florida jail after pleading to procuring an underage girl for prostitution. His friendship with Brunel initially survived. Brunel visited Epstein in jail in 2008, according to court records and, according to Vasquez, continued living in the Epstein-owned apartment in Manhattan for years afterward. But by 2015, amid one of the legal flashpoints in the case since the plea deal, Brunel said he\u2019d had enough. He sued Epstein, alleging he and MC2 \u201clost multiple contacts and business in the modelling business as a result of Epstein\u2019s illegal actions\u201d. Claiming to have been \u201cemotionally destroyed\u201d by inaccurate reports connecting him to Epstein\u2019s activities, Brunel even submitted a photograph of the label from his bottle of Prozac as an exhibit in the case. Among the other evidence Brunel offered was correspondence from an executive at Mega Partners, a modelling agency in Brazil, stating that the firm had been unable to work with Brunel for five years because of his association with Epstein. Yet it was with Mega Partners that Brunel was working in April this year, watching as hopeful young women sashayed down a makeshift catwalk at the firm\u2019s offices in Brasilia. Nivaldo Oliveira Leite, Mega\u2019s chief executive, spoke fondly of him in a message posted to Facebook. Brunel \u201cwill always have open doors to our house\u201d, he said.",

The ad poses many questions: why are these men so excited by the kind of al-desko lunch produced by a quick rootle round the fridge?

A car, presumably an eGolf, glides by, causing the woman to look up, perhaps wistfully. Who is in the car? Could it be a camper, an astronaut and an athlete, off to meet their babysitting chums in the bagel cafe? Who knows: you carry on sitting on a roadside with your kid, Barbara-no-mates.

      "bodyText": "Many years ago, a friend\u2019s mother asked her if her husband was going to accompany them to the playground. \u201cNo, Mum,\u201d my pal replied, with what the cynical might assume was false brightness. \u201cHe\u2019s seen the kids go down a slide before.\u201d Now, in these times when, as enraged libertarians like to point out, one can hardly crack a common-or-garden joke without being sent to the stocks, she\u2019d probably be fined for perpetuating a negative gender stereotype. Well: only if she were making an ad and sticking it on primetime TV. Last week, under new rules that empower the Advertising Standards Authority to regulate depictions of men and women in ways that can \u201cplay a part in limiting people\u2019s potential\u201d, came the first news of infringements. The offenders? Some cream cheese and an electric car. In the first, a pair of new dads, who do not appear to know one another, become so beguiled by a Philadelphia-slathered bagel that they accidentally abandon their infants to a food-delivery conveyor belt of the type you might see in London\u2019s hipsterish Hoxton. The ad poses many questions: why are these men so excited by the kind of al-desko lunch produced by a quick rootle round the fridge? Why have they, in contravention of all the laws of British social life, struck up a conversation? Given the slowness and generous width of the conveyor belt, how much danger are these children actually in? No matter: our hapless cafe-goers are prime examples of the damaging notion that men are ineffectual care-givers. Out they go! Volkswagen\u2019s advertisement for its eGolf car is perhaps even more bemusing. A male and female couple camp on the side of a cliff, though the woman is only briefly glimpsed, dozing. Cut to some astronauts, and then to a male para-athlete doing the long jump and, finally, to a woman sitting on a bench, beside a pram. A car, presumably an eGolf, glides by, causing the woman to look up, perhaps wistfully. Who is in the car? Could it be a camper, an astronaut and an athlete, off to meet their babysitting chums in the bagel cafe? Who knows: you carry on sitting on a roadside with your kid, Barbara-no-mates. Perhaps the lady camper will come and help you change its nappy. Both ads are baffling, but are they harmful? Common sense tells us the answer: in isolation, unlikely; as a cog in the machine of advanced capitalism and entrenched gender power structures, quite possibly. But why stop at gender? We don\u2019t appear to be bothered that the protagonists of these ads are white and look fairly well off \u2013 as of course they need to be, to afford fancy lunches and new cars. After all, we know how to reach black people: you simply paste your message on the inside of a fried chicken box. The poor? A bogof deal or a payday loan.

The victory will put Wales at the top when the revised world rankings are published on Monday and if their performance was not that of putative World Cup winners, it again showed how difficult they are to overcome when they are geared up for a scrap.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/17/all-blacks-deliver-bledisloe-pain-with-36-point-whitewash-of-wallabies\">All Blacks deliver Bledisloe pain with 36-point whitewash of Wallabies</a> </p> </aside>  <p>They felt they were too relaxed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/11/england-wales-rugby-world-cup-warmup-match-report\" title=\"\">at the start at Twickenham last Sunday</a>, losing the match in a somnolent opening 20 minutes, but here they were fully attentive. It was an afternoon when the result did hold significance for them and not just because their opponents were again only at half strength. The sides could meet in the quarter-finals of the World Cup, depending where they finish in their group, and England are the only Six Nations team that Wales have lost to more than beaten since their head coach Warren Gatland took over 12 years ago.</p> <p>The one try came when England were down to 13 men in the first half. Anthony Watson, a late replacement for Ruaridh McConnochie, was trudging his way to the sin-bin after receiving a yellow card for deliberately knocking-on to prevent Wales from exploiting a three-man overlap as they counterattacked in their own half. Willi Heinz had just left the field for a head injury assessment and Ben Youngs was waiting to replace him.</p> <p>As England pondered their realignment, Dan Biggar, who had set up to kick the ball into touch on the left, turned to the other wing and punted long for Josh Adams, who caught the ball and made it into the opposition 22. England eventually scrambled back, but when two phases later Biggar received the ball again, George North was among three players unmarked on the left.</p> <p>Biggar chipped the ball with the outside of his right foot and North only had to catch it to score his 38th try for Wales, a tally exceeded only by Gareth Thomas and Shane Williams.</p> <p>It proved to be the difference between the sides and highlighted the tactical importance of Biggar, who recovered his starting place following the long-term injury suffered by Gareth Anscombe at Twickenham.</p> <p>Wales fielded Josh Adams, rather than North, on the right wing to mark Joe Cokanasiga, and Biggar sent a flurry of kicks along that flank after an early bombardment of Elliot Daly yielded no profit. Wales scrummaged with greater purpose than at Twickenham, and were more accurate in the lineout, where Aaron Wainwright was employed regularly until a dead leg forced him off at half-time.</p> <p>England conceded penalties under pressure, not least at the breakdown, and while Wales did not aim for the posts until the 26th minute when Biggar gave them the lead, they took on England at their strongest point, at close quarters rather than among the three-quarters. They put a few moves together, but they were preparing for the World Cup when defence is expected to decide matches between the leading sides.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"338fcf2c1d7d13726e418f069782a7ce189ee207\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/338fcf2c1d7d13726e418f069782a7ce189ee207/0_0_5196_3563/1000.jpg\" alt=\"England v Wales\" width=\"1000\" height=\"686\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Billy Vunipola of England is tackled by Tomas Francis and Josh Adams of Wales.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Rogers/The RFU Collection via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>England responded to their 10-point interval deficit by reinforcing their ranks with four Lions early in the second half, including Owen Farrell. Two George Ford penalties brought them close, but they struggled to sustain pressure and their best move was from a lineout just inside their own half when Youngs and George combined to free Watson.</p> <p>Wales held on, just, relieved when Lewis Ludlam also did so with the ball on the floor to concede a penalty. There were five minutes to go when Leigh Halfpenny kicked a penalty from 45 metres to put his side a converted try ahead shortly after narrowly missing from halfway. Both the full-backs\u2019 efforts had an element of weariness, with a lack of altitude each time, but Halfpenny was only drafted into the side minutes before the start after Liam Williams felt a hamstring tighten and, not being selected on the bench, he had had a gruelling morning training session.</p> <p>England had one final chance when they kicked a penalty to touch but could not get their driving maul into gear against opponents with by then an unfamiliar back five forward formation. The result apart, Eddie Jones could take at least as much out of the game as Gatland, given the players who were missing. For once there is an air of mystery about England, a sense that a tale of the unexpected may be unfurling.</p> <p>Jones raised an eyebrow when told Wales had gone to the top of the rankings. Gatland turned a lighter shade of red, saying it was just a number and that \u201cKiwi journalists will say it is a joke\u201d. He knows only too well that the time to get ahead of New Zealand is a few seconds from the end of the World Cup final.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/219\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Breakdown: sign up for our weekly rugby union email. </figcaption> </figure>",

      "bodyText": "This was a warm-up that did not lack heat. Both camps maintained in the build-up that results were of secondary importance as they counted down to the start of the World Cup in Japan, but the rapture Wales\u2019s players showed in the final minute when they repelled a maul suggested otherwise. The response of the crowd at the final whistle was even more jubilant. The victory will put Wales at the top when the revised world rankings are published on Monday and if their performance was not that of putative World Cup winners, it again showed how difficult they are to overcome when they are geared up for a scrap. They felt they were too relaxed at the start at Twickenham last Sunday, losing the match in a somnolent opening 20 minutes, but here they were fully attentive. It was an afternoon when the result did hold significance for them and not just because their opponents were again only at half strength. The sides could meet in the quarter-finals of the World Cup, depending where they finish in their group, and England are the only Six Nations team that Wales have lost to more than beaten since their head coach Warren Gatland took over 12 years ago. The one try came when England were down to 13 men in the first half. Anthony Watson, a late replacement for Ruaridh McConnochie, was trudging his way to the sin-bin after receiving a yellow card for deliberately knocking-on to prevent Wales from exploiting a three-man overlap as they counterattacked in their own half. Willi Heinz had just left the field for a head injury assessment and Ben Youngs was waiting to replace him. As England pondered their realignment, Dan Biggar, who had set up to kick the ball into touch on the left, turned to the other wing and punted long for Josh Adams, who caught the ball and made it into the opposition 22. England eventually scrambled back, but when two phases later Biggar received the ball again, George North was among three players unmarked on the left. Biggar chipped the ball with the outside of his right foot and North only had to catch it to score his 38th try for Wales, a tally exceeded only by Gareth Thomas and Shane Williams. It proved to be the difference between the sides and highlighted the tactical importance of Biggar, who recovered his starting place following the long-term injury suffered by Gareth Anscombe at Twickenham. Wales fielded Josh Adams, rather than North, on the right wing to mark Joe Cokanasiga, and Biggar sent a flurry of kicks along that flank after an early bombardment of Elliot Daly yielded no profit. Wales scrummaged with greater purpose than at Twickenham, and were more accurate in the lineout, where Aaron Wainwright was employed regularly until a dead leg forced him off at half-time. England conceded penalties under pressure, not least at the breakdown, and while Wales did not aim for the posts until the 26th minute when Biggar gave them the lead, they took on England at their strongest point, at close quarters rather than among the three-quarters. They put a few moves together, but they were preparing for the World Cup when defence is expected to decide matches between the leading sides. England responded to their 10-point interval deficit by reinforcing their ranks with four Lions early in the second half, including Owen Farrell. Two George Ford penalties brought them close, but they struggled to sustain pressure and their best move was from a lineout just inside their own half when Youngs and George combined to free Watson. Wales held on, just, relieved when Lewis Ludlam also did so with the ball on the floor to concede a penalty. There were five minutes to go when Leigh Halfpenny kicked a penalty from 45 metres to put his side a converted try ahead shortly after narrowly missing from halfway. Both the full-backs\u2019 efforts had an element of weariness, with a lack of altitude each time, but Halfpenny was only drafted into the side minutes before the start after Liam Williams felt a hamstring tighten and, not being selected on the bench, he had had a gruelling morning training session. England had one final chance when they kicked a penalty to touch but could not get their driving maul into gear against opponents with by then an unfamiliar back five forward formation. The result apart, Eddie Jones could take at least as much out of the game as Gatland, given the players who were missing. For once there is an air of mystery about England, a sense that a tale of the unexpected may be unfurling. Jones raised an eyebrow when told Wales had gone to the top of the rankings. Gatland turned a lighter shade of red, saying it was just a number and that \u201cKiwi journalists will say it is a joke\u201d. He knows only too well that the time to get ahead of New Zealand is a few seconds from the end of the World Cup final.",

      "body": "<p>Louise Doughty is a novelist, playwright and journalist. Her 2010 novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jun/06/whatever-you-love-louise-doughty\" title=\"\"><em>Whatever You Love</em></a>, was shortlisted for the Costa novel award and the Orange prize, while her bestselling novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/16/apple-tree-yard-doughty-review\" title=\"\"><em>Apple Tree Yard</em></a> was adapted by the BBC into a four-part drama starring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/16/apple-tree-yard-doughty-review\" title=\"\">Emily Watson and Ben Chaplin</a>. Her most recent novel, <em>Platform Seven</em>, tackles suicide, coercive control and life after death.</p> <p><strong><em>Platform Seven</em> features a dead protagonist. Why did you want to tell a story from the perspective of someone who</strong><strong> has died?</strong><br>I grew up in a small town in the East Midlands, so going back home to see my parents has always involved changing trains at Peterborough. It can be a really bleak station on a cold winter\u2019s night, and I used to have a joke that when I die and go to purgatory, I\u2019ll find myself trapped on Peterborough station. So I decided to have a novel with the ghost of a woman who was trapped there: it\u2019s a transitional place. She\u2019s a lost soul.</p> <p><strong>What were the challenges in having a dead protagonist?</strong><br>I was really intrigued by the technical challenge. For a start, you have to work out what your ghost can do. Can my ghost pass through walls? Are they a poltergeist? I decided early on that I wanted her to be able to read people\u2019s minds because as well as her story, I wanted the novel to be an ensemble piece: she is also the omniscient narrator of other people\u2019s lives.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1616437a1f4ae872cf1bae807814e7c074b5b988\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1616437a1f4ae872cf1bae807814e7c074b5b988/0_113_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Chaplin and Emily Watson in the 2017 BBC adaptation of Louise Doughty\u2019s novel Apple Tree Yard.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ben Chaplin and Emily Watson in the 2017 BBC adaptation of Louise Doughty\u2019s novel Apple Tree Yard.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Briggs/BBC/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>One of the central themes in the book is </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/27/new-coercive-control-laws-under-spotlight-in-hammer-killing-appeal\" title=\"\"><strong>coercive control</strong></a><strong>. What made you want to write about that?</strong><br>I was interested in writing about a relationship where there was no physical abuse but a huge amount of manipulation and psychological abuse, and how that could be just as potent and deadly. And trying to convey the ways in which very ordinary men, who people think of as good blokes, can be abusive in ways that are so subtle and all-pervasive that even the recipient mistrusts her own perceptions of it.</p> <p><strong>What research did you do?</strong><br>I think everybody has been in or come close to a relationship like that, and if you\u2019re lucky you get out early not because you necessarily fully understand what\u2019s going on, you just know something doesn\u2019t feel right. I think that by-and-large women are still raised to mistrust their own instincts if a man presents as eligible.</p> <p><strong>Coercive control was </strong><strong>criminalised in 2015</strong><strong>, and yet by the end of 2018 the vast majority of cases had been dropped without charge. Why do you think that is?</strong><br>Women who\u2019ve been subjected to it for many years might not seem reliable: they don\u2019t trust themselves, their stories may be inconsistent, they may have mental health problems, which after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/27/coercive-control-crime-domestic-abuse-women\" title=\"\">decades of coercive control</a> is almost inevitable. It\u2019s the same for a lot of crimes against women: the focus is still on the behaviour of the victim. There\u2019s got to be a seismic shift.</p> <p><strong>When did your love of writing begin?</strong><br>Very early on. I was often accused of having an overactive imagination as a child and I was an avid reader. I used to fib to my mum, saying I was going out to play with the other kids and actually having a book in my pocket. I\u2019d built a den on the waste ground at the far end of the housing estate where I grew up and I would hide there and read. I wrote a novel when I was 11; I even cut out cardboard covers because I wanted it to be a hardback. And I spent a lot of time in the local library. It made me into a writer.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I remember spending a fair amount of time in wardrobes hoping to get through and see a talking fawn</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>So </strong><strong>you didn\u2019t grow up in a bookish household</strong><strong>?</strong><br>Not at all. My dad left school when he was 13, my mum when she was 15 or 16, and my brother and sister and I were the first generation to go to university. My parents were from very working-class backgrounds but my father did have a real bee in his bonnet about education and self-improvement .</p> <p><strong>What were your favourite books as a child?</strong><br>I was into fantasy and science fiction. I loved the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2018/jan/24/essential-novels-ursula-k-le-guin\" title=\"\">Ursula K Le Guin</a> Wizard of Earthsea books. Fantasy at that age is about pure imagination, and what those books showed me is that the whole world is at your fingertips if you write. And before that, the Narnia books: I remember spending a fair amount of time in wardrobes hoping to get through and see a talking fawn.</p> <p><strong>Which writers have most influenced your own writing?</strong><br>In terms of contemporary fiction, Margaret Atwood, Michael Ondaatje and Toni Morrison. Also 19th-century writers: the Bront\u00eb sisters in particular, and Dickens. The idea of the big, fat complicated story is what\u2019s influenced me most.</p> <p><strong>Which genres do you </strong><strong>most enjoy?</strong><br>Story-driven literary fiction: a really good writer telling a really good story.</p> <p><strong>Are there any you avoid?</strong><br>I can\u2019t bear any sort of romantic fiction: anything soppy or chicklitty or girly. It brings me out in hives. I\u2019m not saying I don\u2019t write about romance or relationships. But I want those people to have complex lives. It really annoys me in a book if people don\u2019t have jobs or never worry about the gas bill.</p> <p><strong>Is there a book or author you always return to?</strong><br>I would read anything by the Norwegian journalist \u00c5sne Seierstad \u2013 she wrote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/aug/31/travel.features\" title=\"\"><em>The Bookseller of Kabul</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/08/one-of-us-review-compelling-anders-breivik\" title=\"\"><em>One of Us</em>, about the Anders Breivik killings</a>. She\u2019s a really good long-form journalist.

I\u2019d like to tell Emily that even though <em>Wuthering Heights</em> got really bad reviews and was compared very unfavourably with <em>Jane Eyre</em>, now people consider it superior. And I\u2019d like to beg her not to destroy her second novel.</p> <p><strong>What books are on your bedside table to read next?</strong><br>Top of the list is <em>Rife: Twenty-One Stories from Britain\u2019s Youth</em>, which is an anthology edited by Nikesh Shukla and Sammy Jones.

      "bodyText": "Louise Doughty is a novelist, playwright and journalist. Her 2010 novel, Whatever You Love, was shortlisted for the Costa novel award and the Orange prize, while her bestselling novel Apple Tree Yard was adapted by the BBC into a four-part drama starring Emily Watson and Ben Chaplin. Her most recent novel, Platform Seven, tackles suicide, coercive control and life after death. Platform Seven features a dead protagonist. Why did you want to tell a story from the perspective of someone who has died? I grew up in a small town in the East Midlands, so going back home to see my parents has always involved changing trains at Peterborough. It can be a really bleak station on a cold winter\u2019s night, and I used to have a joke that when I die and go to purgatory, I\u2019ll find myself trapped on Peterborough station. So I decided to have a novel with the ghost of a woman who was trapped there: it\u2019s a transitional place. She\u2019s a lost soul. What were the challenges in having a dead protagonist? I was really intrigued by the technical challenge. For a start, you have to work out what your ghost can do. Can my ghost pass through walls? Are they a poltergeist? I decided early on that I wanted her to be able to read people\u2019s minds because as well as her story, I wanted the novel to be an ensemble piece: she is also the omniscient narrator of other people\u2019s lives. One of the central themes in the book is coercive control. What made you want to write about that? I was interested in writing about a relationship where there was no physical abuse but a huge amount of manipulation and psychological abuse, and how that could be just as potent and deadly. And trying to convey the ways in which very ordinary men, who people think of as good blokes, can be abusive in ways that are so subtle and all-pervasive that even the recipient mistrusts her own perceptions of it. What research did you do? I think everybody has been in or come close to a relationship like that, and if you\u2019re lucky you get out early not because you necessarily fully understand what\u2019s going on, you just know something doesn\u2019t feel right. I think that by-and-large women are still raised to mistrust their own instincts if a man presents as eligible. Coercive control was criminalised in 2015, and yet by the end of 2018 the vast majority of cases had been dropped without charge. Why do you think that is? Women who\u2019ve been subjected to it for many years might not seem reliable: they don\u2019t trust themselves, their stories may be inconsistent, they may have mental health problems, which after decades of coercive control is almost inevitable. It\u2019s the same for a lot of crimes against women: the focus is still on the behaviour of the victim. There\u2019s got to be a seismic shift. When did your love of writing begin? Very early on. I was often accused of having an overactive imagination as a child and I was an avid reader. I used to fib to my mum, saying I was going out to play with the other kids and actually having a book in my pocket. I\u2019d built a den on the waste ground at the far end of the housing estate where I grew up and I would hide there and read. I wrote a novel when I was 11; I even cut out cardboard covers because I wanted it to be a hardback. And I spent a lot of time in the local library. It made me into a writer. So you didn\u2019t grow up in a bookish household? Not at all. My dad left school when he was 13, my mum when she was 15 or 16, and my brother and sister and I were the first generation to go to university. My parents were from very working-class backgrounds but my father did have a real bee in his bonnet about education and self-improvement . What were your favourite books as a child? I was into fantasy and science fiction. I loved the Ursula K Le Guin Wizard of Earthsea books. Fantasy at that age is about pure imagination, and what those books showed me is that the whole world is at your fingertips if you write. And before that, the Narnia books: I remember spending a fair amount of time in wardrobes hoping to get through and see a talking fawn. Which writers have most influenced your own writing? In terms of contemporary fiction, Margaret Atwood, Michael Ondaatje and Toni Morrison. Also 19th-century writers: the Bront\u00eb sisters in particular, and Dickens. The idea of the big, fat complicated story is what\u2019s influenced me most. Which genres do you most enjoy? Story-driven literary fiction: a really good writer telling a really good story. Are there any you avoid? I can\u2019t bear any sort of romantic fiction: anything soppy or chicklitty or girly. It brings me out in hives. I\u2019m not saying I don\u2019t write about romance or relationships. But I want those people to have complex lives. It really annoys me in a book if people don\u2019t have jobs or never worry about the gas bill. Is there a book or author you always return to? I would read anything by the Norwegian journalist \u00c5sne Seierstad \u2013 she wrote The Bookseller of Kabul and One of Us, about the Anders Breivik killings. She\u2019s a really good long-form journalist. And Janet Malcolm \u2013 I\u2019m a big fan of hers. Which literary figures \u2013 dead or alive \u2013 would you most like to meet? The Bront\u00ebs, but they can leave Branwell at home. I\u2019d like to tell Emily that even though Wuthering Heights got really bad reviews and was compared very unfavourably with Jane Eyre, now people consider it superior. And I\u2019d like to beg her not to destroy her second novel. What books are on your bedside table to read next? Top of the list is Rife: Twenty-One Stories from Britain\u2019s Youth, which is an anthology edited by Nikesh Shukla and Sammy Jones. Also Bernardine Evaristo\u2019s Girl, Woman, Other. I\u2019m reading Elif Sharak\u2019s 10 Minutes 38 Seconds in this Strange World at the moment and loving it. And Will Storr\u2019s The Science of Storytelling because I\u2019m interested in how the human brain invents and consumes narrative. \u2022 Platform Seven by Louise Doughty is published by Faber (\u00a314.99).

      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.batforlashes.com/\" title=\"\">Bat </a><a href=\"https://www.batforlashes.com/\" title=\"\">for Lashes</a> is the stage name of Natasha Khan, who was born in London in 1979 to an English mother and a Pakistani father. Raised in Hertfordshire, she studied music and visual arts at the University of Brighton and worked as a nursery school teacher for four years before committing to music full-time. A rich seam of theatricality was woven into her songwriting from the start, taking shape in elaborate outfits and intense stage performances. Three of her four Bat for Lashes albums to date, including 2006 debut <em>Fur and Gold,</em> have been nominated for the Mercury prize (Khan also released an album via her side project Sexwitch in 2015). Her latest album, <em>Lost Girls,</em><em> </em>comes out next month.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019ve talked about wanting this new album to be fun, full of romance and more commercial. How did it come about?</strong><br>I had moved away from London, where I\u2019d lived for seven years, and finished my contract with EMI. My plan initially was to go to Los Angeles to focus on scriptwriting and doing music for film. The first song on the album, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qm3Xg289qTM\" title=\"\">Kids in the Dark,</a> was actually written for a Stephen King TV series [<em>Castle Rock</em>] \u2013 but the music supervisor Charles [Scott] and I had such a good time that we decided to keep meeting. I didn\u2019t even know whether I was going to make an album again \u2013 I wanted to have a real break and leave everything behind me. And so when this album started happening, it was sort of a secret \u2013 and nobody really knew about it until it was nearly done.</p> <p><strong>Was there an overarching concept?</strong><br>I was developing a script for a film called <em>The Lost Girls.</em> It was heavily influenced by 80s children\u2019s films and vampire films, many set in Portland and California. But as the songs progressed, I felt like I was writing the film soundtrack. Music does tend to overtake film ideas, as it comes out much more easily.</p> <p><strong>Which 80s films did you have in mind?</strong><br><em>The Lost Boys</em>, obviously, is a close link, and seeing LA\u2019s hazy sunsets is making me think of films like <em>ET </em>and <em>The Goonies.</em> Moving to LA, I\u2019ve basically been plonked inside the sets of all the films I loved as a kid.</p> <p><strong>What switched you on to music?</strong><br>I saw Michael Jackson on his <em>Bad </em>tour when I was nine, with my mum, and I remember his Thriller video coming out \u2013 that was really exciting. And later on, seeing how pop musicians like Kate Bush and David Bowie were using the more theatrical aspects of music had a big influence on me. At art college, the way we approached music was very closely linked with visual art and performance. With my first band I said, \u201cI want us to make headdresses\u201d, and so we\u2019d go down to the haberdashery and buy a bunch of sequins and old lady brooches in antique shops. It was a hodgepodge and it probably didn\u2019t even make sense, but I was trying to figure out how we were going to stand out on stage and express ourselves in a playful way.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s been the most surreal experience of your career so far?</strong><br>It\u2019s always surreal when people I love come to shows, like Bj\u00f6rk turning up to one of my first big shows in London, or seeing Tilda Swinton in the audience. Or supporting Radiohead on tour \u2013 as a teenager I was listening to <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VNCSU4tGD0\" title=\"\">The Bends</a></em> every day on the train to school, and then 10 years later I\u2019m supporting them around Europe. It\u2019s also surreal when I make a video based on something I\u2019ve had in my imagination for a really long time, and then I find myself stepping into my own dream. Who gets to do that?</p> <p><strong>Who are your dream collaborators?</strong><br>I would love to write a script with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/28/horror-director-ari-aster-hereditary-midsommar-terrors\" title=\"\">Ari Aster</a> who directed <em>Hereditary </em>and <em>Midsommar,</em> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/jordan-peele\" title=\"\">Jordan Peele</a> [director of <em>Get Out</em> and <em>Us</em>]. I really like this new genre of sophisticated horror that\u2019s coming out at the moment, so I would love to direct a script I\u2019d co-written with one of those guys.</p> <p><strong>Have you acclimatised to California?</strong><br>I do love LA for its landscapes and light, and the optimism and ambition of the people, but being English I\u2019m very aware that I probably couldn\u2019t exist there for a long time. I miss the seasons, the grittiness and the English sense of humour. And part of the reality in America is having no health insurance. And heat that melts the pavements and so much traffic and smog. But there\u2019s no perfect place.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qm3Xg289qTM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qm3Xg289qTM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qm3Xg289qTM\">Watch the video for Kids in the Dark by Bat for Lashes.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>By temperament, do you lean towards sunny Californian optimism or British gloom?</strong><br>I go between the two.

I spent a long time trawling the depths and the darkness in my music. But being in LA, maybe it has liberated that side of me that is more fun.</p> <p><strong>Do you keep up with the news?</strong><br>I\u2019m obviously aware of things that are happening, but I don\u2019t give a lot of time and energy to it, because it\u2019s become such a big ball of knots. We used to think that we could rely on things we saw in the news to be real, but at the moment everything\u2019s being exposed as lies and no one seems to really know what\u2019s going on. It adds a lot to my anxiety and confusion, so I think my time is much better spent creating work that is quite positive and sublimating all these worries into something a bit more productive.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019re approaching your 40s. How do you feel about it?</strong><br>There\u2019s a side of me that can\u2019t believe I\u2019m going to be 40, because I feel so young, and because what I do tethers me to a part of my psyche that\u2019s full of childlike wonder. There\u2019s a sadness about accepting that you\u2019re getting older, and the way society views age doesn\u2019t help. But when I think about all the people I have admired, film-makers and writers, they only get better with age.

Everybody thinks they are the best in the race. That\u2019s how sprints work and that\u2019s how it\u2019s got to be. And I want to win.\u201d</p> <p>The 23-year-old proved she was world class in Berlin last year, clocking world-leading times of 10.85sec and 21.89 to break her own national records, as she won gold in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/aug/07/dina-asher-smith-wins-100m-euro-gold\" title=\"\">100m</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/aug/11/dina-asher-smith-european-championships\" title=\"\">200m</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/aug/12/dina-asher-smith-european-championship-third-gold-relay\" title=\"\">4x100m relay</a>. However, she knows she will have her work cut out on Sunday when she headlines the Birmingham Diamond League in a 200m that oozes extreme class and guile.</p> <p>When she looks around on the starting blocks she will see a who\u2019s who of sprinting: Dafne Schippers, the world champion; Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, a double Olympic gold medallist and seven-times world champion; Blessing Okagbare and Shaunae Miller-Uibo, who have run the second and third fastest times in the world this year. There will also be a host of other top sprinters who are likely to be in the world championship finals in Doha next month.</p> <p>But the message from Asher-Smith is clear: bring it on. \u201cYou can\u2019t be daunted by anybody,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody in track and field who is infallible or unable to be beaten.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/21/dina-asher-smith-proud-to-finish-second-in-100m-final-in-quality-field\">Dina Asher-Smith proud to finish second in 100m final at London Stadium</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Her confidence is understandable. Asher-Smith has run under 11 seconds for the 100m three times this season and won two of her three Diamond League races over 200m, and she intends to double up in Doha. She also has happy memories of Birmingham, where she ran a personal best and nearly took down the legendary Allyson Felix as a teenager in 2015.</p> <p>\u201cI love racing here,\u201d she says. \u201cOne of my favourite races ever was in Birmingham when I first raced against Allyson and I ran a massive PB out of nowhere of 22.30sec. I was so dead; I threw up on Ricky Simms\u2019 shoes afterwards! It was right next to the media tent and I said to him: \u2018How am I going to do media?\u2019 And he said: \u2018You\u2019ll be fine!\u2019</p> <p>\u201cSo I remember running out my skin here before and, obviously, I got rewarded,\u201d she adds. \u201cSo I\u2019m coming to run out my skin again. I\u2019m naturally quite a chilled and quiet person but whenever I step on to the track, I\u2019m fiercely competitive; and every time I step on the line, I\u2019m here to win.</p> <p>\u201cI love running in the UK and I\u2019m really happy I get to run in the UK late in the season and closer to the world championships.

      "bodyText": "When the question came, Dina Asher-Smith did not even blink. \u201cWhat is it like being the hunted, not the hunter, now that you are one of the best sprinters in the world?\u201d Britain\u2019s triple European champion was asked. \u201cI like it,\u201d she replied. \u201cIt\u2019s cool. Everybody thinks they are the best in the race. That\u2019s how sprints work and that\u2019s how it\u2019s got to be. And I want to win.\u201d The 23-year-old proved she was world class in Berlin last year, clocking world-leading times of 10.85sec and 21.89 to break her own national records, as she won gold in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay. However, she knows she will have her work cut out on Sunday when she headlines the Birmingham Diamond League in a 200m that oozes extreme class and guile. When she looks around on the starting blocks she will see a who\u2019s who of sprinting: Dafne Schippers, the world champion; Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, a double Olympic gold medallist and seven-times world champion; Blessing Okagbare and Shaunae Miller-Uibo, who have run the second and third fastest times in the world this year. There will also be a host of other top sprinters who are likely to be in the world championship finals in Doha next month. But the message from Asher-Smith is clear: bring it on. \u201cYou can\u2019t be daunted by anybody,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody in track and field who is infallible or unable to be beaten.\u201d Her confidence is understandable. Asher-Smith has run under 11 seconds for the 100m three times this season and won two of her three Diamond League races over 200m, and she intends to double up in Doha. She also has happy memories of Birmingham, where she ran a personal best and nearly took down the legendary Allyson Felix as a teenager in 2015. \u201cI love racing here,\u201d she says. \u201cOne of my favourite races ever was in Birmingham when I first raced against Allyson and I ran a massive PB out of nowhere of 22.30sec. I was so dead; I threw up on Ricky Simms\u2019 shoes afterwards! It was right next to the media tent and I said to him: \u2018How am I going to do media?\u2019 And he said: \u2018You\u2019ll be fine!\u2019 \u201cSo I remember running out my skin here before and, obviously, I got rewarded,\u201d she adds. \u201cSo I\u2019m coming to run out my skin again. I\u2019m naturally quite a chilled and quiet person but whenever I step on to the track, I\u2019m fiercely competitive; and every time I step on the line, I\u2019m here to win. \u201cI love running in the UK and I\u2019m really happy I get to run in the UK late in the season and closer to the world championships. It\u2019s not quite a final goodbye for the worlds but it\u2019s as close as we can get.\u201d And she is not even scared by the thought of facing someone as great as Fraser-Pryce, who ran an astonishing 10.73 earlier this season for 100m after coming back from pregnancy. \u201cIt actually makes me focus more,\u201d she says. \u201cI can\u2019t be daunted by somebody else\u2019s thing. If they want to break the world record, there\u2019s nothing I can do to control it. All I can do is control my own performances. I am looking to do the best I can and if it comes in a nice glittery form in Doha then I will be really happy but even if it doesn\u2019t and I run fast times I will have to take it.\u201d Event organisers have confirmed that more than 60 global medallists \u2013 including 10 reigning Olympic champions, two Paralympic champions and 13 reigning world champions \u2013 will compete at the Alexander Stadium. While the world indoor champion, Christian Coleman, has pulled out, there is still a strong 100m field including Akani Simbine \u2013 the Commonwealth champion \u2013 the triple Olympic medallist Andre De Grasse and the former European champion Adam Gemili. In the 400m, the European champion, Matt Hudson-Smith, returns to action in his local stadium for the men\u2019s 400m \u2013 his first race since September 2018.

A document written by the Home Office\u2019s drug legislation team last year and sent to Glasgow councillors, admitted there was \u201cevidence for the effectiveness of drug consumption rooms and addressing the problems of public nuisance associated with open drug scenes, and in reducing health risks for drug users\u201d. Campaigners point out that overdose rates have fallen in European countries that have adopted the policy, while in Britain they have soared. The latest data show that there were 4,359 deaths from drug poisoning in England and Wales last year, with more than half involving an opiate such as heroin. Martin Powell of the Transform Drug Policy Foundation, which attempts to reduce the damage caused by drugs through evidence-based policy reform, said: \u201cWhen thousands of families are being bereaved every year by avoidable drug deaths, it is unconscionable that the government continues to block supervised drug consumption rooms \u2013 especially when they have acknowledged to Glasgow council, where the NHS is crying out to be allowed to open one, that they work. We call on the home secretary to recognise this as a public health emergency and act now.\u201d most recent research, published in June, found that the facilities saved 230 deaths in 20 months in British Columbia. The Canadian province has a similar population and drug problem to Scotland. Last year the Guardian visited a safe consumption facility in Denmark where 800 overdoses had been registered without a single death because nurses had quickly administered antidotes and resuscitated the person before calling an ambulance. Campaigners say drug-related deaths in the country have stabilised since 2011 while there have been no recorded deaths in a drug consumption room in Europe, of which there are at least 78. The UK government\u2019s Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs itself has stated that safe-injecting rooms in Vancouver, Canada, and Sydney, Australia, have been successful in cutting overdose fatalities.",

For the last few years, a group of us have rented a big, old house somewhere in deepest France. It\u2019s a place I love as much as anywhere I\u2019ve ever stayed: you will know what I mean when I say that it\u2019s the kind of house where you want only to read Colette, and eat apricots, and lie in the bath with a large glass of ros\u00e9 while listening to Francoise Hardy (you might want to pretend that you <em>are</em> Francoise Hardy, I couldn\u2019t possibly comment). However, there is a problem, and that is the aforementioned coffee situation.</p> <p>The house has an old-fashioned percolator, but only one. There are no cafetieres, no stove-top devices, and no Nespresso machine. (I can no more imagine a Nespresso machine on its ancient kitchen counters than I can a go-go dancer.)

Should I pack my own cafetiere this year? I have considered this. But we\u2019re travelling easyJet, and I think I would rather use my baggage allowance for another pair of sandals than a coffee pot. (Earlier today, I experimented, and tried to put a pair of sandals <em>inside</em> a cafetiere - alas, only one shoe would fit.)</p> <p>Thinking about this leads me to consider the problem of coffee-making generally. The perfect cup of coffee is like the perfect lipstick: a quest that will end only with your death. I disapprove of Nespresso machines and their ilk, and I don\u2019t particularly like the coffee they make either. Cafetieres are so messy and gritty, and I never seem to get the coffee-to-water ratio quite right; also, the coffee gets cold so quickly. I love my blackened stove-top Bialetti for reasons to do with nostalgia and all-round stylishness, but it makes pretty mud-like coffee: good for days when you\u2019re knackered, but very bad indeed when the last thing you need is to be wired like Frankenstein. The huge, orange Italian espresso machine that I bought at vast expense some years ago looks fantastic. But working it is such a performance, and the coffee it makes always tastes of its metallic bowels to me.</p> <p>I think the best method at home is the most simple. Drip, drip, drip: like a percolator, only without the stewing effect of the hotplate. I have a china filter and I line it with a (recycled) paper filter, and that\u2019s my morning cup \u2013 just as my dad used to make his in 1976. (His beans, incidentally, were roasted by <a href=\"https://pollardscoffee.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Pollards of Sheffield</a>, a business, established in 1879, that is still going strong and which now has a website, should you, too, be an exile.)</p> <p>This is no good for large numbers \u2013 unless, of course, you set out 10 cups and 10 filters \u2013 but the coffee it makes is at once rich and gentle, and the grounds are so easily dealt with. It takes a little while, but this is a good thing: as you wait, you can stare out of the window, pause for a moment before you begin your day. In these anxious times, such kitchen rituals are nothing short of a life raft.</p> <p>Of course, I\u2019m not the only dripper around. Our numbers are growing exponentially, this being, I gather, the hipster\u2019s method of choice. But in the 21st century, nothing is allowed to be simple for long \u2013 or at any rate, a thing\u2019s simplicity must always be augmented; made more refined. A company called Kinto makes what it calls a brewer stand set. It comprises a wooden base, a brass pole at the top of which is a brass filter, and a glass jug that holds four cups of coffee. Naturally, it is made in Japan. It costs \u2013 wait for it \u2013 \u00a3180. Yet even as I laugh at this, a feeling comes over me that is all too familiar. I might as well be at a Mac counter, about to buy yet another shade of matt rose. This bit of kit could be life changing \u2026 couldn\u2019t it?

(His beans, incidentally, were roasted by Pollards of Sheffield, a business, established in 1879, that is still going strong and which now has a website, should you, too, be an exile.) This is no good for large numbers \u2013 unless, of course, you set out 10 cups and 10 filters \u2013 but the coffee it makes is at once rich and gentle, and the grounds are so easily dealt with. It takes a little while, but this is a good thing: as you wait, you can stare out of the window, pause for a moment before you begin your day. In these anxious times, such kitchen rituals are nothing short of a life raft. Of course, I\u2019m not the only dripper around. Our numbers are growing exponentially, this being, I gather, the hipster\u2019s method of choice. But in the 21st century, nothing is allowed to be simple for long \u2013 or at any rate, a thing\u2019s simplicity must always be augmented; made more refined. A company called Kinto makes what it calls a brewer stand set. It comprises a wooden base, a brass pole at the top of which is a brass filter, and a glass jug that holds four cups of coffee. Naturally, it is made in Japan. It costs \u2013 wait for it \u2013 \u00a3180. Yet even as I laugh at this, a feeling comes over me that is all too familiar. I might as well be at a Mac counter, about to buy yet another shade of matt rose. This bit of kit could be life changing \u2026 couldn\u2019t it?

Maturity is when the government repays the debt at the end of the term. When more investors are buying government bonds prices go up, and yields drop.</p>\n    <p>Companies can also issue bonds.</p>\n    <p><b>What happens when the yield curve inverts?</b></p>\n    <p>This is when the yield on short-term bonds is higher than on long-term bonds. It means that traders are accepting a lower interest rate to hold longer-dated bonds than the shorter-dated alternative.</p>\n    <p>It\u2019s relatively rare \u2013 investors typically get higher returns for lending over the long term, as this is seen as riskier than short-term lending. They also expect to be compensated for the impact of inflation, which will eat into investments over time.</p>\n    <p><b>What does it mean?</b></p>\n    <p>An inverted yield curve is a classic signal of a looming recession \u2013 in the US, the curve has inverted ahead of every recession over the past 50 years. It falsely signalled a recession just once, at the time of the 1998 Russian financial crisis.</p>\n    <p>For other countries the signal is less clear. Several have experienced long periods of inverted yield curves without a subsequent recession, notably the UK in the 1990s.</p>\n    <p><b>Why is it happening now?</b></p>\n    <p>The yield curve for two- to 10-year US government bonds <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2019/aug/14/germany-economy-shrinks-gdp-recession-uk-inflation-stock-markets-business-live\">has inverted for the first time since 2007</a>, just before the start of the global financial crisis. This indicates that investors are seriously worried about an economic downturn, which would keep inflation low. They are worried about the impact on the already-weak global economy of the prolonged trade war between the US and China, along with Brexit.</p>\n    <p><b>Is recession inevitable?</b></p>\n    <p>No, but it is highly likely. And an inverted yield curve driven by recession fears risks becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy, knocking confidence and causing businesses to cut back on investment.</p>\n    <p><b>How soon does recession tend to follow yield curve inversion?</b></p>\n    <p>Previous downturns show that yields have typically inverted 18 months, on average, before a recession began. <b>Julia Kollewe</b></p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Then there is Italy, which could prove to be an even bigger problem.

In a co-working space in Soho, the 39-year-old founder and CEO of <a href=\"https://www.realeyesit.com/\" title=\"\">Realeyes</a>, an \u201cemotion AI\u201d startup which uses eye-tracking and facial expression to analyse mood, scrolls through a list of 20 festive ads from 2018. He settles on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNbSgMEZ_Tw\" title=\"\">The Boy and the Piano</a>, the offering from John Lewis that tells the life story of Elton John backwards, from megastardom to the gift of a piano from his parents as a child, accompanied by his timeless heartstring-puller Your Song. The ad was well received, but J\u00e4\u00e4tma is clearly unconvinced.</p> <p>He hits play, and the ad starts, but this time two lines \u2013 one grey (negative reactions), the other red (positive) \u2013 are traced across the action. These follow the second-by-second responses of a 200-person sample audience who watched the ad and allowed Realeyes to record them through the camera of their computer or smartphone. Realeyes then used its AI technology to analyse each individual\u2019s facial expression and body language. The company did this with all of J\u00e4\u00e4tma\u2019s list of 20 Christmas ads from 2018, watching 4,000 people, before rating each commercial for attention, emotion, sentiment and finally giving it a mark out of 10.</p> <p>What is wrong with The Boy and the Piano, then? \u201cSo these are the metrics we measure: are you happy? Confused? Sad? Disgusted?\u201d explains J\u00e4\u00e4tma, as the video plays. \u201cIf you look at the grey line, the negative emotions, you see that the UK audience is not that excited about the Elton John parts. The negativity goes up, people are tired about this promotion of the celebrity, they have had enough of this Elton John stuff.\u201d Only when Elton as a child makes an appearance is there a spike of red. \u201cNow when it goes into family and kids and it\u2019s not the celebrity any more,\u201d J\u00e4\u00e4tma goes on, \u201cthat\u2019s where the positivity goes up.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"afdbb351aa87263ce1e44e5f77de0042a0f79087\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/afdbb351aa87263ce1e44e5f77de0042a0f79087/0_0_3281_1969/1000.jpg\" alt=\"elton john spotlit on stage at a grand piano wearing a frock coat\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Lewis\u2019s Christmas 2018 advert with Elton John.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Lewis &amp; Partners/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Realeyes assigned the John Lewis commercial a score of 7.8 out of 10, placing it 12th out of the 20 Christmas ads they tested.

You can only put that on TV, no one\u2019s going to watch that online.\u201d</p> <p>This is clearly a big deal for John Lewis: their Christmas campaign is by far the most important of the year. But what difference does it make to us? Quite a lot, potentially, argues J\u00e4\u00e4tma. Realeyes was founded in 2007 with the goal of teaching computers how we feel. \u201cThere\u2019s obviously this whole big debate about: is AI going to come and kill us or is it going to come and help us?\u201d says J\u00e4\u00e4tma, an Estonian who started Realeyes with two friends while doing an MBA at the University of Oxford. \u201cRight now, AI is like this big brain that is very intelligent and knows everything, but what we say is that it misses a heart. What we want to build into the AI is emotional understanding and consciousness. So the better we make it, the more likelihood that all this AI stuff will actually be good for humanity and not the other way around.\u201d</p> <p>J\u00e4\u00e4tma and his partners \u2013 another Estonian, Martin Salo, and an Azerbaijani, Elnar Hajiyev, who work on the technical side \u2013 decided initially to focus on advertising because, they felt, it would be the quickest path to grow and make money. And, over a decade, they have created a database that they think is the richest and most sophisticated in the world. It is made up of 420m frames of people watching video on their devices (all have given their permission to be captured). These images are then labelled by seven different people, based on the American psychologist Paul Ekman\u2019s list of basic emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise. Realeyes has gone to efforts to make the training algorithm culturally sensitive, by having Europeans tag Europeans or Asians annotate Asians, but for J\u00e4\u00e4tma, the beauty of Ekman\u2019s theory, which dates from the early 1970s, is that the basic emotions are expressed the same way whether the subject is from Japan or Madagascar.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d37121407ec49b7e43be1380a305bfde37db4582\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d37121407ec49b7e43be1380a305bfde37db4582/120_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"realeyes software in operation mapping a womans face\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Realeyes software in operation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Realeyes</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Realeyes is doing well.

      "bodyText": "It is early July, almost 30C outside, but Mihkel J\u00e4\u00e4tma is thinking about Christmas. In a co-working space in Soho, the 39-year-old founder and CEO of Realeyes, an \u201cemotion AI\u201d startup which uses eye-tracking and facial expression to analyse mood, scrolls through a list of 20 festive ads from 2018. He settles on The Boy and the Piano, the offering from John Lewis that tells the life story of Elton John backwards, from megastardom to the gift of a piano from his parents as a child, accompanied by his timeless heartstring-puller Your Song. The ad was well received, but J\u00e4\u00e4tma is clearly unconvinced. He hits play, and the ad starts, but this time two lines \u2013 one grey (negative reactions), the other red (positive) \u2013 are traced across the action. These follow the second-by-second responses of a 200-person sample audience who watched the ad and allowed Realeyes to record them through the camera of their computer or smartphone. Realeyes then used its AI technology to analyse each individual\u2019s facial expression and body language. The company did this with all of J\u00e4\u00e4tma\u2019s list of 20 Christmas ads from 2018, watching 4,000 people, before rating each commercial for attention, emotion, sentiment and finally giving it a mark out of 10. What is wrong with The Boy and the Piano, then? \u201cSo these are the metrics we measure: are you happy? Confused? Sad? Disgusted?\u201d explains J\u00e4\u00e4tma, as the video plays. \u201cIf you look at the grey line, the negative emotions, you see that the UK audience is not that excited about the Elton John parts. The negativity goes up, people are tired about this promotion of the celebrity, they have had enough of this Elton John stuff.\u201d Only when Elton as a child makes an appearance is there a spike of red. \u201cNow when it goes into family and kids and it\u2019s not the celebrity any more,\u201d J\u00e4\u00e4tma goes on, \u201cthat\u2019s where the positivity goes up.\u201d Realeyes assigned the John Lewis commercial a score of 7.8 out of 10, placing it 12th out of the 20 Christmas ads they tested. It was rated fifth out of the retailer\u2019s eight Christmas commercials since 2011. \u201cSo we concluded that this ad\u2026 the kid was the star,\u201d says J\u00e4\u00e4tma. \u201cIt would have been better without Elton John almost. Or at least shorter.\u201d The ad ran at 2min 20sec \u2013 \u201cway too long. You can only put that on TV, no one\u2019s going to watch that online.\u201d This is clearly a big deal for John Lewis: their Christmas campaign is by far the most important of the year.

      "bodyText": "Forensic officers are searching a caravan site three miles from where a newlywed policeman died in the line of duty after being dragged by a vehicle as he responded to reports of a burglary. PC Andrew Harper, who was due to go on honeymoon next week, was killed late on Thursday evening when he was struck by a vehicle after leaving his car at the crossroads on the A4 near Sulhamstead village, Berkshire. Thames Valley police have launched a wide-ranging murder investigation into the 28-year-old officer\u2019s death and have arrested 10 suspects, including a 13-year-old boy. All the suspects, the oldest of whom is 30, remain in custody. The force has provided more details on the incident that led to Harper\u2019s death while he was responding to a report of burglary at a residential property at 11:18pm. The officer on duty with Harper was not physically injured, but is receiving emotional support, police confirmed. On Saturday, forensic officers were seen scouring the caravan site on Padworth Road, near Burghfield Common, where two vans were apparently blocking the entrance. Inquiries are currently focusing on one vehicle, understood to be a Seat. Thames Valley police would not comment on whether any of the suspects resided at the caravan site, but said: \u201cThis police presence forms part of the investigation following the death of PC Andrew Harper. Officers are at the scene making inquiries.\u201d The force also refused to comment on a report suggesting that Harper was hit by a second police car which was responding to the incident. Meanwhile, Harper\u2019s father, Philip, spoke of the family\u2019s grief following his death. \u201cWe\u2019re absolutely devastated and we\u2019re in a bad place,\u201d he said to Sky News. Grieving colleagues also laid floral tributes at the scene of Harper\u2019s death, with one describing him as \u201cThames Valley\u2019s finest\u201d. The officer had served as policeman for nearly a decade. Another tribute read: \u201cA shockingly sad day. We come together as a brotherhood at times like this and hopefully your family can take some comfort from that love and support.\u201d On Friday, the Thames Valley chief constable, John Campbell, explained that Harper was at the scene with a fellow officer and was out of his police car when the incident occurred, adding: \u201cWhat we do know is, Andrew had been dragged along by a vehicle.\u201d The suspects were detained within approximately an hour of the incident and officers were working \u201chard and diligently to find out what happened\u201d, he added. One witness told the Daily Mail that Harper\u2019s colleague begged the officer to \u201cstay with me, keep breathing\u201d as he lay dying in the country lane. Campbell said Harper was a \u201chighly regarded, popular member of the team\u201d, adding: \u201cEverybody I\u2019ve spoken to about Andrew talked about the incredible personality he was, what a fantastic police officer, and what a great friend and man he was, and he\u2019ll be sorely missed by everybody.\u201d The force\u2019s flags are flying at half-mast as a sign of respect \u201cin honour and memory of Andrew\u201d, he said. A postmortem examination is taking place to establish the cause of death. Harper joined as a special constable in 2010 before becoming a police officer a year later, serving in the roads policing proactive unit based at Abingdon police station. Facebook pictures show Harper and his wife, Lissie, celebrating their wedding a month ago at Ardington House, a Georgian manor in Oxfordshire set in picturesque gardens and parkland. Paying tribute, the deputy police and crime commissioner at Thames Valley police, Matthew Barber, said: \u201cTalking to police who knew him well on the force, he [PC Harper] was a very popular officer.\u201d John Apter, chair of the Police Federation of England and Wales \u2013 which represents rank-and-file officers \u2013 called the death of 10 officers in the last decade \u201cshocking\u201d. \u201cThose figures are shocking for an unarmed force,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cFor 10 officers to be killed at the hands of others over that period of time is truly shocking.\u201d",

Clarke, who told the BBC on Friday that he had been on holiday and had not closely followed the news about a potential unity government, said he was nevertheless willing to be considered as a potential leader of a unity government. \u201cIf it was the only way in which the plain majority in the House of Commons that is opposed to a no-deal exit could find a way forward \u2026 I wouldn\u2019t object to it,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s PM programme. \u201cBut there\u2019s an awful lot to be gone through before then and I haven\u2019t been taking part in any talks with anybody for the last fortnight. I\u2019ve been on the phone to one or two people in the last couple of days just to find out what the devil\u2019s going on.\u201d Clarke claimed it was wrong \u201cfactually and constitutionally\u201d for Corbyn to portray himself as the only viable figure to lead a unity government. However, the father of the House of Commons offered another role for any unity government \u2013 a remit to negotiate a new Brexit deal \u2013 when others had suggested it should be restricted to negotiating an extension to article 50 and then calling either an election, which is Corbyn\u2019s preference, or a referendum, which some MPs would prefer. Clarke said he would lead a \u201csingle-issue, short-term government\u201d with a policy to \u201csort out Brexit\u201d \u2013 a far cry from the preferred Lib Dem route of a second referendum. \u201cI think it would seek an extension, actually put together a mandate for discussions that the majority of the House of Commons approved of, and a mandate that the Europeans would not resist \u2013 like staying in the customs union, staying in regulatory alignment, keeping our free flows of trade and investment, protecting our jobs and our key sectors of business and agriculture in this country,\u201d he said. \u201cThen, once it had got that under way and set, it would call an election probably or resign and let\u2019s see if parliament could form a party government of any kind that took it all forward and started resuming other politics.\u201d Conservative MPs came under heavy pressure on Friday to distance themselves from Corbyn\u2019s proposal. The former justice secretary David Gauke tweeted: \u201cIf anyone thinks the answer is Jeremy Corbyn, I think they\u2019re probably asking the wrong question.\u201d Other independent MPs also came out swinging against the Labour leader. Anna Soubry, the former Tory MP who now leads the Independent Group for Change, said her five MPs \u201cwill not support nor facilitate any government led by Jeremy Corbyn. He cannot command unity of support amongst his own MPs, but now Jeremy Corbyn calls on the rest of us to back him as \u2018unity\u2019 prime minister,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we won\u2019t even get a people\u2019s vote, but instead a general election, which as we know will solve nothing.\u201d Cable said Corbyn must now set out his plan B if he could not command a majority himself. \u201cIt would be up to the House of Commons to decide who a caretaker prime minister put in place to stop a no-deal Brexit would be,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not about party leaders, but getting a group together to stop no deal. It is clear Jeremy Corbyn cannot command that majority in the house. I urge him to do the right thing and confirm that if he cannot, he will support someone who can.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The reputation of Peter Fonda as an actor could never match that of his father, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/feb/07/screen-legends-henry-fonda-french\" title=\"\">Henry</a>, or his older sister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/jane-fonda\" title=\"\">Jane</a>. Even taken on its own terms, his career was alarmingly erratic. Its peak was probably reached when Fonda, who has died aged 79 of lung cancer, played Captain America in the 1969 road movie Easy Rider, although he took everyone by surprise when, after years in the cinematic wilderness, he gave the best performance of his career (and gained an Oscar nomination) for Ulee\u2019s Gold (1997).</p> <p>Like his sister, Peter had a troubled childhood. In his 1998 memoir, Don\u2019t Tell Dad, he chronicled his difficult, distant relationship with his famous father. Describing Henry\u2019s role in John Ford\u2019s Fort Apache (1948) as \u201can unsmiling, bitter, strict hard-ass,\u201d he added, \u201cWhen people ask me what it was like growing up as Henry Fonda\u2019s son, I ask them if they have seen Fort Apache.\u201d</p> <p>Born in New York, he and Jane were sent to live with an aunt and uncle in Nebraska following the suicide of their mother, Frances Ford Seymour, in 1950, when Peter was 10. On his 11th birthday, he accidentally shot himself in the stomach and nearly died. Years later, he told <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/johnlennon\" title=\"\">John Lennon</a>, during an LSD session, that \u201cI know what it\u2019s like to be dead\u201d, a phrase which ended up becoming part of the lyrics for the Beatles\u2019 song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLzfo59AdEc\" title=\"\">She Said, She Said</a>.</p> <p>Fonda decided at an early age that he wanted to become an actor, and after studying at the University of Nebraska in Omaha, his father\u2019s hometown, he began performing in the local theatre. His first success was as the lead in Harvey, about an alcoholic who believes he sees a giant rabbit. He made his Broadway debut in 1961 in Blood, Sweat and Stanley Poole, an army comedy for which he won a Theatre World award for best actor.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aee41c0eaef629db972c74ba05c032b369ebc449\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aee41c0eaef629db972c74ba05c032b369ebc449/0_30_3504_2103/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Fonda and Sandra Dee in Tammy and the Doctor, 1963.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter Fonda and Sandra Dee in Tammy and the Doctor, 1963.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/UNIVERSAL/Sportsphoto Ltd.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although being his father\u2019s son became as much of a blessing as a curse, initially it was no drawback. The rangy, goodlooking Fonda, who had something of the laidback, physical grace of his father, made a pleasant enough Hollywood debut in 1963 as the romantic lead, opposite the vibrant teen star <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/feb/22/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\" title=\"\">Sandra Dee</a>, in Tammy and the Doctor (1963). In the same year, in Carl Foreman\u2019s almost three-hour second world war drama The Victors, which follows a squad of American soldiers in Europe, Fonda is a new recruit who has to watch meekly as some nasty GIs have themselves a little fun testing their prowess as marksmen on a small dog he has adopted.</p> <p>But it was in his third feature, Lilith (1964), Robert Rossen\u2019s strange and intelligent study of schizophrenia, in which he played a vulnerable, bookish, love-stricken mental health patient who veers between violent outbursts and extreme calm, that he first had the chance to prove that there was another Fonda around to be reckoned with.</p> <p>In 1966, The Wild Angels provided a complete change of image for the young star. In a time of counterculture, when standard Hollywood output was found wanting, Fonda turned away from his father\u2019s sphere of influence by going to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/roger-corman\" title=\"\">Roger Corman</a>\u2019s independent setup for this hit biker picture. Fonda starred as Heavenly Blues, a sulky, long-haired, leather-clad Hell\u2019s Angels leader, who announces: \u201cWe wanna be free! We wanna be free to do what we wanna do.

      "bodyText": "The reputation of Peter Fonda as an actor could never match that of his father, Henry, or his older sister, Jane. Even taken on its own terms, his career was alarmingly erratic. Its peak was probably reached when Fonda, who has died aged 79 of lung cancer, played Captain America in the 1969 road movie Easy Rider, although he took everyone by surprise when, after years in the cinematic wilderness, he gave the best performance of his career (and gained an Oscar nomination) for Ulee\u2019s Gold (1997). Like his sister, Peter had a troubled childhood. In his 1998 memoir, Don\u2019t Tell Dad, he chronicled his difficult, distant relationship with his famous father. Describing Henry\u2019s role in John Ford\u2019s Fort Apache (1948) as \u201can unsmiling, bitter, strict hard-ass,\u201d he added, \u201cWhen people ask me what it was like growing up as Henry Fonda\u2019s son, I ask them if they have seen Fort Apache.\u201d Born in New York, he and Jane were sent to live with an aunt and uncle in Nebraska following the suicide of their mother, Frances Ford Seymour, in 1950, when Peter was 10. On his 11th birthday, he accidentally shot himself in the stomach and nearly died. Years later, he told John Lennon, during an LSD session, that \u201cI know what it\u2019s like to be dead\u201d, a phrase which ended up becoming part of the lyrics for the Beatles\u2019 song She Said, She Said. Fonda decided at an early age that he wanted to become an actor, and after studying at the University of Nebraska in Omaha, his father\u2019s hometown, he began performing in the local theatre. His first success was as the lead in Harvey, about an alcoholic who believes he sees a giant rabbit. He made his Broadway debut in 1961 in Blood, Sweat and Stanley Poole, an army comedy for which he won a Theatre World award for best actor. Although being his father\u2019s son became as much of a blessing as a curse, initially it was no drawback. The rangy, goodlooking Fonda, who had something of the laidback, physical grace of his father, made a pleasant enough Hollywood debut in 1963 as the romantic lead, opposite the vibrant teen star Sandra Dee, in Tammy and the Doctor (1963). In the same year, in Carl Foreman\u2019s almost three-hour second world war drama The Victors, which follows a squad of American soldiers in Europe, Fonda is a new recruit who has to watch meekly as some nasty GIs have themselves a little fun testing their prowess as marksmen on a small dog he has adopted. But it was in his third feature, Lilith (1964), Robert Rossen\u2019s strange and intelligent study of schizophrenia, in which he played a vulnerable, bookish, love-stricken mental health patient who veers between violent outbursts and extreme calm, that he first had the chance to prove that there was another Fonda around to be reckoned with. In 1966, The Wild Angels provided a complete change of image for the young star. In a time of counterculture, when standard Hollywood output was found wanting, Fonda turned away from his father\u2019s sphere of influence by going to Roger Corman\u2019s independent setup for this hit biker picture. Fonda starred as Heavenly Blues, a sulky, long-haired, leather-clad Hell\u2019s Angels leader, who announces: \u201cWe wanna be free! We wanna be free to do what we wanna do. We wanna be free to ride. We wanna be free to ride our machines without being hassled by the man! \u2026 And we wanna get loaded. And we wanna have a good time. And that\u2019s what we are gonna do\u2026\u201d (The line was sampled at the start of the 1990 Primal Scream hit Loaded). At the end, when the cops come to arrest some of the gang, his girlfriend (Nancy Sinatra) begs him to leave. He replies, \u201cThere\u2019s nowhere to go.\u201d However, at that stage, Fonda knew where he was going. Following the success of Wild Angels, Fonda starred in Corman\u2019s The Trip (1967), shot, according to the posters, in \u201cpsychedelic colour\u201d. He plays a confused TV commercial director who takes his first \u201ctrip\u201d on LSD, and experiences visions of sex, death, strobe lights, dancing girls, witches, hooded riders and a torture chamber. The Trip, which was written by Jack Nicholson, also featured Dennis Hopper as an acidhead. It was during a publicity tour for The Trip, after smoking some grass and drinking some beer in his Toronto hotel room, that he claimed, \u201cI understood immediately just what kind of motorcycle, sex, and drug movie I should make next.\u201d Fonda and Hopper then conceived, wrote (with Terry Southern, the three gaining an Oscar nomination), raised the finance for, and starred in Easy Rider. Hopper\u2019s first feature as director, and Fonda\u2019s as producer, was made for $400,000, and took more than $16m at the box office, which rose to more than $60m worldwide in the next three years. The counterculture hit followed two hippies (Hopper and Fonda), who hit the road on motorcycles \u201cin search of the real America\u201d but instead find hostility from small-town bigots. The odyssey ends when the two are shot down by a truck driver who despises their iconoclastic lifestyle. Stupidity, corruption and violence are set against the potential freedom of America that Fonda and Hopper represent. Tall, thin and cool in black leathers and shades, and wearing a jacket which bore a large American flag across the back, Fonda\u2019s Captain America became an icon of martyrdom. From then on, Fonda\u2019s career took an uncertain turn, lurching from one Easy Rider rip-off to another. In Dirty Mary Crazy Larry (1974), he is on the lam in a souped-up car after stealing cash from a supermarket. The film provided plenty of high-speed chases and crashes, as did Race With the Devil (1975), in which Fonda flees after coming across satanic rituals in Texas. One exception was Spirits of the Dead (1968), three episodes based on the macabre stories of Edgar Allan Poe. In the one episode directed by Roger Vadim, a frisson was caused by the casting of Fonda as the lover of a character played by his sister Jane (Vadim\u2019s wife at the time). Fonda had three tries at directing features, the first being The Hired Hand (1971), a slow, hippy western, which has a masochistic death-of-the-hero ending popularised by Easy Rider. The director himself starred as a cowboy drifter, but he remained off camera for his second feature, Idaho Transfer (1973). A dirt-cheap time-travel movie set in 2027, it is redolent of the early 1970s.

He is survived by his third wife, Parky (Margaret) DeVogelaere, whom he married in 2011, and by his children, Bridget, an actor until her retirement in 2002, and Justin, from his first marriage, to Susan Brewer. \u2022 Peter Henry Fonda, actor, born 23 February 1940; died 16 August 2019",

It took me two years of listless crying, during which I procrastinated/watched 13 series of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/apr/24/greys-anatomy-big-twist-shouldnt-have-surprised-anyone-warning-spoilers\" title=\"\">Grey\u2019s Anatomy</a></em>. I\u2019m so lazy that the night before meeting him, rather than going upstairs to change my trousers when a button fell off, I went to the chip shop wearing a shoelace as a belt.</p> <p>Like a 21st-century <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/nov/30/alexander-hamilton-founding-father-musical-lin-manuel-miranda\" title=\"\">Alexander Hamilton</a>, he does everything as if he\u2019s running out of time because he\u2019s acutely conscious that he is. \u201cI\u2019ve got this frustrating, peculiar awareness of my mortality. I know I\u2019m going to die unfulfilled, because I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything I can ever do that will make me feel as if my life\u2019s been worthwhile.\u201d For a 56-year-old research pioneer who also saves lives daily, this seems borderline pathological. Has he always been like this? He remembers an incident when he was seven or eight. \u201cWe were on holiday and I remember looking at the sea and thinking \u2018Oh my God, all this will end and it won\u2019t be in very long\u2019. It\u2019s obviously completely pathological, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>A career in intensive care has increased that awareness. \u201cA quarter of our patients die, that\u2019s just the nature of critical illness. There\u2019s a myth about why people die and how\u2026 because they\u2019re very bad or very good. It isn\u2019t like that. It\u2019s a roll of the dice. We get 21-year-olds who were super fit gym bunnies in the morning and dead a day or two later.\u201d</p> <p>Partly to keep death at bay, and partly because he is, as he describes himself, \u201crapaciously interested,\u201d Montgomery keeps outlandishly busy. He loves new things, hard things and the constant flow of information. \u201cI like puzzles, so it\u2019s partly trying to work out how to learn something.\u201d The claim that he learns a skill a year, I realise, is an understatement to make people like me feel better. This year he\u2019s learning the guitar, but also to swim. Not the basic mechanics, you understand \u2013 he was \u201ca county-level swimmer\u201d in his teens \u2013 but learning proper technique with a triathlon coach.</p> <p><em><strong>What has been</strong></em> the hardest of his new skills? \u201cI did a year of particle physics and that was appallingly hard. I struggled because I don\u2019t see the world in terms of mathematics.\u201d And the most fun? \u201cClose-up magic. There\u2019s no purpose at all, but it\u2019s fabulous.\u201d</p> <p>How on earth does he fit it all in? There\u2019s that Thatcherite sleep regime, but it\u2019s also, he says, a question of perspective. For him, work time is \u201ctiles\u201d and other time is \u201cgrouting\u201d. \u201cYou look at a bathroom wall and you see an awful lot of tile. But if you worked out the area covered with grouting it\u2019s probably tankloads.\u201d He packs his \u201cgrouting\u201d with activity, inevitably renouncing my own pastimes, becoming consumed with envy on Instagram and rage on Twitter. \u201cI must be the only person in the world who has never read a Harry Potter book or seen a Facebook page\u2026 I dally with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hugh_montgomery?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" title=\"\">Twitter,</a> but quickly learned I was just in this massive echo chamber.

That impression we have that life goes faster as we age, he believes, is because for many of us, getting older means we are rarely surprised by life. \u201cNew experiences make things seem to run slower. You go on a holiday to somewhere you\u2019ve never been and everything is amazing and interesting and a week away seems like you\u2019ve been away for a month.

Don\u2019t watch reality TV shows about other people living life \u2013 go and live it yourself.

      "bodyText": "I meet Prof Hugh Montgomery the day after the heatwave reaches its sticky, stultifying peak, a day when Londoners are red-eyed, over-caffeinated and on a hair trigger. It\u2019s business as usual, however, for Montgomery. With an expansive enthusiasm that cuts through the clammy torpor, he\u2019s fine: he rarely tops five hours a night. \u201cI get up between 4 and 5am. But I wouldn\u2019t want to promulgate the idea that not sleeping is a good thing.\u201d It might not be recommended, but in his case, it\u2019s essential. You need those extra hours when you\u2019re chair of Intensive Care Medicine at UCL, a practising clinician, a groundbreaking genetic researcher (Montgomery is director of the Institute for Human Health and Performance and discovered the ACE gene that influences physical fitness and endurance) and founder member of the UK Climate and Health Council. He has also conducted research on Everest, run three ultramarathons, skydived naked for charity and holds the world record for playing piano underwater (110 hours, as part of a team during his medical school days. He persuaded Yamaha to create a keyboard that would work underwater and \u201cdumped it in a swimming pool\u201d.) This is a mere scattering of career highlights. Montgomery learns a new skill each year, of which more later, and we are meeting to mark the publication of his novel, Control, a dark, twisty thriller set \u2013 naturally \u2013 in a hospital. It\u2019s pleasingly medical, with visceral descriptions of surgery and a wealth of jargon. \u201cThere\u2019s a drama to medicine for people who\u2019ve never seen a crash intubation or a kid on an operating table who\u2019s dying,\u201d he says. Control is not Montgomery\u2019s first book. In addition to the 477 academic publications listed on his CV, he wrote a children\u2019s book as a Christmas present for his godchildren. \u201cI was working long hours and the shops were shut\u201d (not a \u00a35 note in an envelope for him).

      "body": "<p>Nickelodeon\u2019s <em>Dora the Explorer</em>, an educational animated series for children that ran from 2000 to 2006, shouldn\u2019t work as a live-action Hollywood remake. Weirdly, this sprightly, self-aware action-adventure movie does. Director James Bobin and co-writer Nicholas Stoller launch with the cartoon\u2019s memorably bouncy theme tune. Within minutes, a six-year-old Dora (Madelyn Miranda) is breaking the fourth wall and asking the audience if they can say \u201cdelicioso\u201d (in the original TV show, Dora would teach viewers Spanish words and phrases). Dora\u2019s simian compadre Boots is computer-animated and integrated into the film\u2019s ever-so-slightly surreal live-action world without question.</p> <p>Dora has grown up in the rainforests of Peru, home-schooled by her parents (a zoologist and an archeologist, played by Eva Longoria and Michael Pe\u00f1a respectively). They are explorers, the film insists, not treasure hunters, in one of its gentle swipes at colonialism. Now 16 years old, Dora (Isabela Moner) is being sent to the city, aka Los Angeles, to attend high school with her cousin Diego (Jeff Wahlberg) while her parents search for Parapata, the lost Incan city of gold. A relentlessly cheery brainiac with a propensity to burst into song, she soon earns the nickname Dorka, turning up to a themed school dance dressed as her \u201cfavourite star\u201d \u2013 the sun. Moner is a magnetic, sunny screen presence. Seeing Dora navigate the wilds of high school would\u2019ve been entertaining enough, but a kidnapping places her and her classmates back in the jungle.</p> <p>In this section of the film, there are <em>Jungle Run</em>-style mazes and puzzles, a farting bog of quicksand and a song about poo. A field of giant pink flowers precedes a trippy, animated interlude. Benicio del Toro voices a masked trickster fox. The result is goofily charming and a rare, age-appropriate children\u2019s film in which the adults are silly and the kids, especially the girls, are smart.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--showcase\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-j9g0PIRjQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/p-j9g0PIRjQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-j9g0PIRjQ\">Watch a trailer for Dora and the Lost City of Gold.</a></figcaption> </figure>",

      "bodyText": "Nickelodeon\u2019s Dora the Explorer, an educational animated series for children that ran from 2000 to 2006, shouldn\u2019t work as a live-action Hollywood remake. Weirdly, this sprightly, self-aware action-adventure movie does. Director James Bobin and co-writer Nicholas Stoller launch with the cartoon\u2019s memorably bouncy theme tune. Within minutes, a six-year-old Dora (Madelyn Miranda) is breaking the fourth wall and asking the audience if they can say \u201cdelicioso\u201d (in the original TV show, Dora would teach viewers Spanish words and phrases). Dora\u2019s simian compadre Boots is computer-animated and integrated into the film\u2019s ever-so-slightly surreal live-action world without question. Dora has grown up in the rainforests of Peru, home-schooled by her parents (a zoologist and an archeologist, played by Eva Longoria and Michael Pe\u00f1a respectively). They are explorers, the film insists, not treasure hunters, in one of its gentle swipes at colonialism. Now 16 years old, Dora (Isabela Moner) is being sent to the city, aka Los Angeles, to attend high school with her cousin Diego (Jeff Wahlberg) while her parents search for Parapata, the lost Incan city of gold. A relentlessly cheery brainiac with a propensity to burst into song, she soon earns the nickname Dorka, turning up to a themed school dance dressed as her \u201cfavourite star\u201d \u2013 the sun. Moner is a magnetic, sunny screen presence. Seeing Dora navigate the wilds of high school would\u2019ve been entertaining enough, but a kidnapping places her and her classmates back in the jungle. In this section of the film, there are Jungle Run-style mazes and puzzles, a farting bog of quicksand and a song about poo. A field of giant pink flowers precedes a trippy, animated interlude. Benicio del Toro voices a masked trickster fox. The result is goofily charming and a rare, age-appropriate children\u2019s film in which the adults are silly and the kids, especially the girls, are smart.",

But then \u201ceagerly anticipated\u201d doesn\u2019t quite cover the release of Greta Gerwig\u2019s <em>Little Women</em>. In case you haven\u2019t been ticking off the days in an analogue, fabric-covered diary (with lock) like a genuine Louisa May Alcott nut, the release date is Christmas Day (Boxing Day in the UK). And on the basis of just <a href=\"https://www.littlewomen.movie/?hs308=search&amp;gclid=CMiNvJ_eh-QCFRKdGwodNfsGZw&amp;gclsrc=ds\" title=\"\">a trailer</a>, <em>Little Women</em> has been tipped for all Oscars by everyone.</p> <p>Overhyped? Absolutely not. This confidence is correctly placed. Despite the diminutive title, <em>Little Women</em> is a ratings behemoth. It always has been. Written in the midst of the American civil war, the novel has spent the intervening 150 years as the stand-out star of novels for young women. The saga of the four sisters of the March family of Massachusetts, their conflicting ambitions and achievements, has proved to be intergenerational catnip. It is also one of those library A-listers that <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2019/08/13/handy-guide-almost-all-little-women-adaptations/\" title=\"\">works super well on screen</a>.

It\u2019s not harpsichord heavy and preachy in the manner of, say, <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> but neither is it overly saccharine and full of orchards \u00e0 la <em>Anne of Green Gables</em>. Each sister has a distinctive set of traits that are easy to grasp and eminently memorable: Meg, the eldest, on the verge of finding love; Beth sweet natured; Amy indulged and precocious. We come for this less reductive version of the Spice Girls, but we stay for Jo March \u2013 the Hamlet of the coming-of-age genre.</p> <p>Jo is important too because she is essentially a fictional version of the author, who wrote her way to independence. Alcott <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/nov/29/louisa-may-alcott-a-practical-utopian-from-a-divided-us\" title=\"\">didn\u2019t really want to write </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/nov/29/louisa-may-alcott-a-practical-utopian-from-a-divided-us\" title=\"\">Little Women</a></em>, preferring a more racy gothic format, but once persuaded by her publisher she used it as a platform to shift perception and 150 years ago left a blueprint for young women for a successful life beyond love and marriage.</p> <p>In her adaptation, already billed as the most feminist yet, Gerwig, the first female director to be nominated for an Oscar for a debut, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/lady-bird\" title=\"\">Lady Bird</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/lady-bird\" title=\"\">,</a> entrusts Jo to Saoirse Ronan (also nominated for an Oscar for that film) and there\u2019s every reason to expect the same <em>Lady Bird</em> magic. Like the author, the director is a cultural iconoclast with an ability to shift our perceptions. In Greta Gerwig, Jo March has met her match.</p> <h2>Greta Thunberg won\u2019t be all at sea with these two</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e54fa9b0705b5763ff872d325acd7319f2e128a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e54fa9b0705b5763ff872d325acd7319f2e128a/0_92_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Greta Thunberg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greta Thunberg and Pierre Casiraghi and Boris Herrmann wave from the Malizia II.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Until Wednesday, my sailing knowledge was gleaned from the 1980s south-coast-based TV drama <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howards%27_Way\" title=\"\">Howards\u2019 Way</a></em>, but that changed when I began following Greta Thunberg\u2019s zero-emissions voyage aboard the carbon-free eco-yacht Malizia II.</p> <p>I became obsessed, some might say a boat bore. But I wanted to make sure our Greta is in good hands. Carrying the hopes of every generation, she is what you might term precious cargo.</p> <p>So I set about checking the crew. Good news: they check out. Both Boris Herrmann and Pierre Casiraghi are adept at crossing storm-tossed oceans. Indeed, Herrmann is planning to compete in the Vend\u00e9e Globe, the Mount Everest of sailing.

      "bodyText": "You have to be super-confident to release a film without Will Ferrell at Christmas. But then \u201ceagerly anticipated\u201d doesn\u2019t quite cover the release of Greta Gerwig\u2019s Little Women. In case you haven\u2019t been ticking off the days in an analogue, fabric-covered diary (with lock) like a genuine Louisa May Alcott nut, the release date is Christmas Day (Boxing Day in the UK). And on the basis of just a trailer, Little Women has been tipped for all Oscars by everyone. Overhyped? Absolutely not. This confidence is correctly placed. Despite the diminutive title, Little Women is a ratings behemoth. It always has been. Written in the midst of the American civil war, the novel has spent the intervening 150 years as the stand-out star of novels for young women. The saga of the four sisters of the March family of Massachusetts, their conflicting ambitions and achievements, has proved to be intergenerational catnip. It is also one of those library A-listers that works super well on screen. There have been at least eight TV versions, a silent 1918 film, a 1933 version, 1949 in Technicolor and the 1994 version starring Susan Sarandon and Winona Ryder. Why? Little Women is eminently \u201crelatable\u201d and doesn\u2019t shirk the bad stuff. It\u2019s not harpsichord heavy and preachy in the manner of, say, Pride and Prejudice but neither is it overly saccharine and full of orchards \u00e0 la Anne of Green Gables. Each sister has a distinctive set of traits that are easy to grasp and eminently memorable: Meg, the eldest, on the verge of finding love; Beth sweet natured; Amy indulged and precocious. We come for this less reductive version of the Spice Girls, but we stay for Jo March \u2013 the Hamlet of the coming-of-age genre. Jo is important too because she is essentially a fictional version of the author, who wrote her way to independence. Alcott didn\u2019t really want to write Little Women, preferring a more racy gothic format, but once persuaded by her publisher she used it as a platform to shift perception and 150 years ago left a blueprint for young women for a successful life beyond love and marriage. In her adaptation, already billed as the most feminist yet, Gerwig, the first female director to be nominated for an Oscar for a debut, Lady Bird, entrusts Jo to Saoirse Ronan (also nominated for an Oscar for that film) and there\u2019s every reason to expect the same Lady Bird magic. Like the author, the director is a cultural iconoclast with an ability to shift our perceptions. In Greta Gerwig, Jo March has met her match. Greta Thunberg won\u2019t be all at sea with these two Until Wednesday, my sailing knowledge was gleaned from the 1980s south-coast-based TV drama Howards\u2019 Way, but that changed when I began following Greta Thunberg\u2019s zero-emissions voyage aboard the carbon-free eco-yacht Malizia II. I became obsessed, some might say a boat bore. But I wanted to make sure our Greta is in good hands. Carrying the hopes of every generation, she is what you might term precious cargo. So I set about checking the crew. Good news: they check out. Both Boris Herrmann and Pierre Casiraghi are adept at crossing storm-tossed oceans. Indeed, Herrmann is planning to compete in the Vend\u00e9e Globe, the Mount Everest of sailing. Crucially, they work well together: they came third in the 2017 Fastnet race. Their voyage shows what real zero-emissions travel looks like as opposed to the pumped-up rhetoric from the airline industry that claims it\u2019ll be going green very soon, replacing kerosene with algae and attaching solar panels to the wings, promises that are basically hot air. Real carbon-neutral transatlantic travel, it transpires, is epic, tough, probably quite pukey and not entirely accessible. Casiraghi happens to be the grandchild of Rainier III, prince of Monaco, and US actress Grace Kelly. He is vice-president of the Monaco Yacht Club. This doesn\u2019t entirely suggest any old Joe can stroll up and pop aboard, as Casiraghi has pointed out: \u201cI\u2019m just transporting Greta. And it was just a way to help her get across. We had a zero-emissions boat. It\u2019s very simple.\u201d Steve Coogan: back of the net for Alan Partridge Footballers usually swerve driving bans, but last week Crawley magistrates broadened the tradition to include actor Steve Coogan and by extension, his alter ego, TV presenter Alan Partridge.

The Gunners have beaten the Clarets every single time they\u2019ve played host at the Emirates, to the aggregate tune of 21-4. And Burnley haven\u2019t won away at Arsenal since September 1974, when a goal from converted full-back Peter Noble secured the spoils in front of a Highbury crowd of only 23,586. Arsenal finished just four points above the relegation places that season, with Burnley comfortable in mid-table, but we digress.</p> <p><strong>Optimism abounds at Arsenal, with the club having splurged in the summer, and the team winning their first game of the new season at Newcastle. </strong>They\u2019re a tough proposition at home, having won 14 out of 19 matches last season, a record only beaten by champions Manchester City and Liverpool. However, Burnley are coming off the back of a sensational 3-0 opening-day win over Southampton, so won\u2019t be feeling too bad about themselves either. They\u2019ll also be aware that Arsenal suffer more than most from early-season nerves; they\u2019ve lost their first home game of the campaign in five of the last eight years.</p> <p><strong>Also, losing runs are there to be broken. </strong>With all that in mind, this looks very interesting indeed. Can Arsenal win the first two games of a Premier League season for the first time since 2009? Or can Burnley win their first two matches in the top division since 1973? It, my good friends, is very much on!</p> <p><strong>Kick off: </strong>12.30pm BST.</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "And that, dear friends, is your lot. Ed Aarons was our man at the Emirates today. His report has landed. Enjoy that one, and thanks for reading this one. And now it\u2019s Sean Dyche\u2019s turn. He thought his team put in a \u201cgood performance\u201d and were \u201cexcellent particularly in the first half\u201d. He\u2019s \u201cdisappointed\u201d that Ben Mee was penalised for handball in the lead-up to Arsenal\u2019s first goal, and also that the hosts were \u201cfalling all over the place\u201d throughout the game. Pointing out that diving is only punishable by a yellow card, he argues: \u201cThat means players can cheat once per game.\u201d He\u2019s not totally pleased. Unai Emery is \u201chappy\u201d. It was a \u201ctough match\u201d but he was pleased his team made a connection with the supporters. They \u201cdidn\u2019t impose the game plan for 90 minutes\u201d, but did some \u201cgood things\u201d nonetheless. His new signings were \u201cvery good\u201d. A statement of intent from today\u2019s match-winner Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang: \u201cIt\u2019s good to start like this, with two wins, before we go to Liverpool. We feel confident. We feel stronger with players like David Luiz and Nicolas Pepe. We are sure we can fight for the top four.\u201d There\u2019s just enough time for Barnes to be booked, the punishment for tugging back Kolasinac, and that\u2019s that! Arsenal have won their first two Premier League matches of the season for the first time in a decade. Burnley were arguably the better side in the first half; Arsenal were certainly the better side in the second, and deserve the three points. But Burnley made them work and sweat. 90 min +4: Arsenal struggle to clear this one, too. But they\u2019re let off the hook as Rodriguez attempts an overly ambitious overhead kick. It\u2019s wild and high. And this match is surely over. 90 min +3: Pope\u2019s up for the corner! Some head tennis. Luiz heads over his own crossbar. There\u2019ll be another corner! 90 min +2: Pepe has a chance of releasing Aubameyang. They\u2019re two on one with Tarkowski. But the pass is no good. Lennon breaks up the other end and wins a corner. Before it\u2019s taken, Luiz is booked for a check on Barnes. 90 min +1: There will be four added minutes. Sokratis is booked for cynical skulduggery on the halfway line. 90 min: Willock makes good down the inside right, reaches the byline, and cuts back for Torreira, who lashes a first-time shot towards the bottom right. Pope does very well to parry. A lovely move, and a save to match. 88 min: Lowton makes a nuisance of himself on the edge of the Arsenal box. Torreira looks to shepherd the ball back towards Leno, and is shoved by the Burnley man for his trouble. He goes over and lands heavily on his shoulder, but after a worrying bout of rolling and grimacing, he\u2019s up again, no serious harm done. 86 min: Aubameyang works his way down the right and wins a corner off Mee. Pepe takes. Barnes heads clear. The clock, a long-time Arsenal icon, ticks on. 85 min: Burnley are seeing plenty of the ball in these closing stages. McNeil whips a curler in from the left, but Barnes can\u2019t meet it at the near post. Leno claims. 83 min: Ceballos departs to a standing ovation. He\u2019s been magnificent today. He\u2019s replaced by the equally popular Torreira. A feelgood moment at the Arsenal. 82 min: Lowton crosses from the right. Rodriguez is lurking, waiting to pounce, but Sokratis does extremely well to negate his threat and guide the ball back to his keeper. 80 min: Luiz blocks off Barnes, 35 yards from goal. Westwood wedges the resulting free kick into the area towards Mee, romping in from the left. But Mee can\u2019t quite get a shot away, and Leno claims. The denizens of the Emirates are getting a little nervous now. It\u2019s quiet and tense. 78 min: Pepe diddles Mee in the midfield - a nutmeg on the turn! He races towards the Burnley box. He\u2019s eventually bundled off the ball by Tarkowski, but what skill. This chap is going to light up the Premier League. 76 min: Arsenal manage to escape, Maitland-Niles working his way down the right and rolling a pass infield for Pepe, who suddenly recognises the opportunity of a goal on his home debut. He strides into space near the Burnley box ... but then sends a dribbler into the arms of Pope. 75 min: Westwood sends a free kick into the Arsenal box from the right. Mee wins a header at the far post, but that one goes wide. Goal kick for Arsenal, but the ball\u2019s soon coming straight back at them. Arsenal are struggling to get out of their own half at the minute. 74 min: Lowton crosses from the right. Barnes flicks on, but to nobody in particular. The ball sails out for a goal kick. The home fans are getting a little nervous, though, as the visitors start to ask one or two questions again, for the first time in a while. 72 min: That\u2019s Gudmundsson\u2019s last act of the afternoon. He\u2019s hooked in favour of Aaron Lennon, who gets the full ex-Tottenham reception as he takes to the field. Meanwhile Lacazette is replaced by Kolasinac. 71 min: Lowton hammers a low shot into the Arsenal area from the right. The ball breaks to Gudmundsson, who crosses deep to McNeil, coming in from the left. McNeil wins a header but sends it well over the bar. 70 min: A little scrappy. 68 min: Luiz is forced to concede a corner on the right, hacking out Lowton\u2019s cross. Leno flaps at the corner, but Arsenal clear their lines eventually. Arsenal have been dominant since the restart, but there\u2019s a reminder that this isn\u2019t over quite yet. 67 min: Westwood leans into the influential Ceballos and concedes a free kick out on the left. The set piece comes to nothing, but the 23-year-old Spaniard, on loan from Real Madrid, is making a serious impression here this afternoon. 65 min: Burnley try to come back at Arsenal, but Lowton\u2019s cross from the right floats harmlessly into Leno\u2019s arms. What a finish by Aubameyang! Ceballos sends him away down the inside left, having won the ball off Gudmundsson. Aubameyang glides in from the wing, drops a shoulder, and fizzes an unstoppable low shot into the bottom left! Pope had absolutely no chance whatsoever. 63 min: Ceballos seems to have more time than everyone else on the pitch. He brings down the ball, almost in slow motion, has a think, and curls a shot towards the top right from the edge of the box. Pope does very well to turn the ball away. 61 min: Now it\u2019s Burnley\u2019s turn to throw on their big new signing. Jay Rodriguez comes on for the quiet Chris Wood. McNeil then crosses from the left, Westwood heading over from six yards. Real chances at both ends! 60 min: Arsenal stroke it around in the passive style ... then suddenly burst into action, Pepe rolling a quick pass down the inside-right and releasing Aubameyang into the area. Aubameyang takes a touch and blasts straight at Pope, who parries well but really shouldn\u2019t have had a chance. 58 min: Corner for Arsenal on the left. Ceballos to take. It\u2019s played short, and worked out to Maitland-Niles, who sends a shot sailing over Highbury &amp; Islington tube. What a waste, having pinned Burnley back. 57 min: Barnes gifts Pepe the ball on the halfway line. Pepe tears down the inside right and tries to release Lacazette. Tarkowski makes sure the door stays shut, but this is much better from Arsenal, who have enjoyed 94% possession since the restart! 55 min: Pepe spins elegantly down the right, sashaying infield and thinking about a shot. He lays off instead to Ceballos, whose effort is blocked. The crowd are already warming to Pepe. Glimpses of his talent already. 53 min: Burnley probe for the first time since the restart, a few neat triangles down the left that result in McNeil lifting a speculative long-range effort well over the bar. 51 min: Ceballos and Monreal combine down the inside-left channel and tee up Aubameyang, who fires towards the top right from distance. His diagonal shot is a little too high, but Pope was worried about that one. 50 min: Pepe isn\u2019t letting things drop, though, and cranks it up again by combining with Aubameyang down the left. It\u2019s a determined run that leads to nothing, but gets the crowd going again. On the touchline, Emery waves his arms in the agitated fashion. He wants some high-tempo play, immediately if not sooner. 49 min: And so Burnley take their sweet time over a throw, irritating the crowd immensely. Unai Emery also seems reasonably unhappy about it, and gives the linesman a piece of his mind. There goes that half-time surge! 47 min: The corner\u2019s played short, then worked to Maitland-Niles to the left of the D. Maitland-Niles dribbles down the left and floats a cross into the middle ... and over the crossbar. Harmless. But the home side have clearly had a talking-to. Immediate signs that they\u2019re planning to step up the pace. Arsenal get the second half underway. And on comes their record signing Nicolas Pepe, who replaces Reiss Nelson. He\u2019s immediately into the action, part of a move which results in Monreal winning a corner out on the left. Half-time entertainment. One of the stars of the summer talks to the Guardian! A couple of boos as the teams leave the field. Burnley gave as good as they got during the first half. They\u2019re deservedly level, having asked Arsenal\u2019s defence a few questions. This is poised deliciously for the second half. Please go nowhere! 45 min +1: And now VAR chalks off an Arsenal goal. Aubameyang slips a pass down the left to release Monreal, who pulls one back towards Nelson at the near post. Nelson flashes a fine finish into the top left. But Monreal\u2019s toenails were offside. 45 min: There was a check for offside, because VAR has to stick its neb in. Barnes was clearly on. No more than Burnley deserve. Lacazette, on the edge of the Burnley box, considers shooting. He doesn\u2019t get a shot away. Burnley clear and tear up the other end. Wood works his way down the left, then lays off to McNeil, who sends a low diagonal pass towards Barnes on the penalty spot. He\u2019s totally unmarked, and after sorting his feet out, pokes the ball into the bottom left, despite pressure eventually arriving from Luiz, at his back. 42 min: The corner leads to nothing. 41 min: A little space and time for Guendouzi, just to the right of the Burnley D. He considers his options before shooting low and hard towards the bottom right. Pope does well to extend a leg, diverting the ball out for a corner. 40 min: Guendouzi strides upfield and sends a pass wide left for Monreal, who crosses first time at great speed. It\u2019s plucked out of the sky by Pope. 38 min: Burnley take a quick free kick, but Aubameyang hasn\u2019t retreated ten yards, and is booked as a result. When the set piece is eventually taken - hoicked into the box, naturally - Barnes sends a weak header into the arms of Leno. Easy for the keeper. Barnes should have done much better. 37 min: A free kick for Burnley out on the left. McNeil\u2019s delivery is extremely poor. Arsenal half-clear, but Willock clatters into Pieters and it\u2019ll be another free kick on the same flank. 35 min: Nelson drives down the left and belts a rising shot goalwards. Pope makes a meal of parrying it, and is grateful for some help from Tarkowski. Burnley clear. 33 min: The toes of Ceballos twinkle again, as he embarks on a mesmeric run down the inside-left channel. He lays off to Willock, just to his left. Willock stands one up, but there\u2019s too much juice on the cross and there\u2019s no chance of Aubameyang meeting the ball. 32 min: Gudmundsson finds Lowton on the overlap down the right. The full back wins a corner. Another chance to stick one in the mixer. Leno punches clear at the near post, some much-needed decisive keeping amid a melee. 30 min: Ceballos performs a couple of elegant pirouettes in the centre circle. He goes nowhere in particular, but the home crowd appreciate the artistry nonetheless. A warm round of applause. 28 min: From the corner, McNeil nearly makes him pay, looking to fire a shot through a penalty-box thicket and into the bottom right. It\u2019s blocked and cleared. But this is spirited stuff from the visitors, who are giving the home defence a thorough pressure test. 27 min: Gudmundsson crosses deep from the right. McNeil is able to trap to the left of the goal. He tries to tee up Barnes, but lamely cushions the ball to Maitland-Niles. However the Arsenal defender, toppling backwards, inexplicably hooks out for a corner. 25 min: Willock gives up possession cheaply, 30 yards from his own goal. That allows Cork to stride forward and look for the top-right corner. His shot is blocked. Arsenal clear. But Burnley have clearly got the whiff of opportunity in their collective beak. Arsenal don\u2019t look particularly confident at the back. 24 min: Arsenal pick it up again. Maitland-Niles bombs down the right and wins a corner. From the set piece, Maitland-Niles, Ceballos and Nelson combine cutely with some crisp passing and very nearly tee up Luiz on the edge of the box. Not quite, but that was pretty play. 22 min: Burnley have done enough since conceding to put the crowd on mute. They\u2019re the sharper side at the moment. Arsenal need to pick it up again. 20 min: An almighty scramble in the Arsenal six-yard box! Leno comes to claim the corner and flaps. Luiz eventually bashes clear, but that could have dropped to anyone. Right now, a clean sheet for Arsenal this afternoon seems far from certain. They\u2019re a bit of a mess at the back. 19 min: Burnley have responded well to falling behind. They\u2019ve enjoyed most of the subsequent possession. A game of head tennis in the Arsenal area, and this will be another corner for the visitors. 17 min: Westwood hooks a high cross into the Arsenal box from the right. Luiz and Leno confuse each other at the near post. Luiz is forced to head out for a corner. From the set piece, Tarkowski wins a header, then Barnes flashes one at Leno from six yards. A sensational point-blank save denies the Burnley striker, though it turns out he was offside anyway. 15 min: Burnley try to hit back immediately, Barnes latching onto a long ball and sending a diagonal shot wide right from the edge of the Arsenal box. Not a bad effort at all, though Leno had that one covered. The corner\u2019s hit low towards Lacazette on the right-hand corner of the six-yard box. He shouldn\u2019t be allowed to turn, but Pieters lets him. He\u2019s falling backwards as he sends a snapshot towards the bottom right. Pope should block, but the ball whistles between his legs and into the net! That\u2019s dismal defending, and the goalkeeping\u2019s not much better. But what work by the striker, who crafted a goal out of next to nothing! 12 min: Mee handles a Maitland-Niles throw from the right. The free kick is half-cleared to Sokratis, on the edge of the Burnley box. He loops the ball back into the mixer. Lacazette heads straight at Pope from six yards. The keeper tips over. Corner. From which ... 10 min: Ceballos finds Lacazette at the near post. The striker eyebrows the ball across the face of goal, forcing Lawton to concede another corner, this time on the left. Nothing comes of the second corner, but Arsenal are beginning to impose themselves after a quiet start. 9 min: Luiz passes long, upfield this time. It\u2019s a glorious ball that nearly releases Aubameyang down the right. Pieters is forced to hack out for a corner. It\u2019ll be taken by Ceballos. 7 min: Burnley look pretty comfortable right now. Not so their manager, who is dancing on the touchline issuing beneficial advice to his players. He\u2019s lost all his nine matches against Arsenal, so you can perhaps understand his agitation. 5 min: Luiz, to the left of his own goal, fires a low pass across the face of an unguarded net. He hit that at 100mph! It finds Sokratis on the other wing. Had that flown just one degree off line, it was whistling into the goal. A preposterous risk, and one of the many reasons all right-thinking football fans enjoy watching the man play. 3 min: A bit of space for Barnes out on the right. His cross is headed clear by Maitland-Niles, but drops to Pieters who has an overly ambitious dig from distance. Nope! 2 min: Lacazette swans in from the left and curls a pass towards his strike partner Aubameyang on the other flank. Aubameyang tries to lay the ball across the front of the area for Willock, but it\u2019s easily dealt with by Mee. Burnley, debuting their evergreen kit, kick off. The ball\u2019s launched forward and out of play with barely ten seconds on the clock. Onwards and upwards! Here come the boys. Arsenal are in their 80s-throwback red shirts with white sleeves, while there\u2019s no claret for the Clarets; Burnley sport third-choice green. A bubbling atmosphere at the Emirates. We\u2019ll be off sooner rather than later! Here\u2019s Unai Emery with some squad updates. \u201cDavid Luiz has been hoping to play, and today he starts his first match with us. Xhaka has a small injury, but hopefully he will be OK. Mesut was sick one day this week, but I am hoping he will be OK next week.\u201d Burnley boss Sean Dyche speaks to BT Sport. \u201cWe got off to a really good start. We\u2019ve had a good pre-season. There\u2019s a nice edge to the collective, not just the 11 we played last week. We\u2019ve had a few things go against us [when playing Arsenal] and maybe VAR will clean those things up now. But it\u2019s beyond that, it\u2019s about us performing. It\u2019s a big ask. But we like what we\u2019re doing, the players are up for it, and I like what they\u2019ve delivered so far. So we\u2019ll see how we go today.\u201d Arsenal\u2019s new kit is lovely, isn\u2019t it. Presses all the right buttons for football fans of a certain vintage. Here it is, pictured below, pretty much. Squint and it could almost be Unai Emery throwing an arm around Matteo Guendouzi. Better crest in those days, mind. Arsenal welcome David Luiz and Dani Ceballos to the Emirates. Nicolas Pepe is a substitute once again. Sead Kolasinac is back in the wake of those security issues, though there\u2019s still no Mesut Ozil. Burnley meanwhile are in full if-it-ain\u2019t-broke mode. They name the same starting XI sent out for last weekend\u2019s big win over Southampton. Arsenal: Leno, Maitland-Niles, Luiz, Papastathopoulos, Monreal, Ceballos, Guendouzi, Nelson, Willock, Aubameyang, Lacazette. Subs: Mkhitaryan, Torreira, Pepe, Chambers, Martinez, Kolasinac, Gabriel Martinelli. Burnley: Pope, Lowton, Tarkowski, Mee, Pieters, Gudmundsson, Cork, Westwood, McNeil, Wood, Barnes. Subs: Taylor, Hendrick, Gibson, Rodriguez, Hart, Lennon, Bardsley. Referee: Mike Dean (Wirral). If recent history is any guide, this is as close to a home banker as it\u2019s possible to get. Arsenal have won ten games in a row against Burnley, a run that stretches back to March 2010. The Gunners have beaten the Clarets every single time they\u2019ve played host at the Emirates, to the aggregate tune of 21-4. And Burnley haven\u2019t won away at Arsenal since September 1974, when a goal from converted full-back Peter Noble secured the spoils in front of a Highbury crowd of only 23,586. Arsenal finished just four points above the relegation places that season, with Burnley comfortable in mid-table, but we digress. Optimism abounds at Arsenal, with the club having splurged in the summer, and the team winning their first game of the new season at Newcastle. They\u2019re a tough proposition at home, having won 14 out of 19 matches last season, a record only beaten by champions Manchester City and Liverpool. However, Burnley are coming off the back of a sensational 3-0 opening-day win over Southampton, so won\u2019t be feeling too bad about themselves either. They\u2019ll also be aware that Arsenal suffer more than most from early-season nerves; they\u2019ve lost their first home game of the campaign in five of the last eight years. Also, losing runs are there to be broken. With all that in mind, this looks very interesting indeed. Can Arsenal win the first two games of a Premier League season for the first time since 2009? Or can Burnley win their first two matches in the top division since 1973? It, my good friends, is very much on! Kick off: 12.30pm BST.",

Seeking to exploit the League\u2019s growing popularity, Salvini called for snap elections and immediately declared himself a candidate for prime minister, urging supporters to give the League \u201cthe strength to take this country in hand and save it\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/07/italy-matteo-salvini-embarks-on-beach-tour-amid-election-speculation\" title=\"\">He took to the campaign trail on the beach</a>, DJ-ing topless and then Instagramming selfies afterwards.</p> <p>But he hadn\u2019t counted on Renzi scheming to derail him.

At first, the idea seemed unthinkable, with the leader of Renzi\u2019s centre-left PD, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/15/nicola-zingaretti-pledges-to-take-on-italys-rightwing-government\" title=\"\">Nicola Zingaretti,</a> describing it as \u201ca gift to the dangerous right\u201d and his M5S counterpart, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/luigi-di-maio\" title=\"\">Luigi Di Maio,</a> saying he would never \u201csit at the table with Renzi\u201d.</p> <p>But, since Tuesday, when both parties caught Salvini off-guard by voting against the League\u2019s motion to inflict a vote of no-confidence on prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/giuseppe-conte\" title=\"\">Giuseppe Conte,</a> the proposal has looked more plausible.

The League is polling at about 38% and could team up with Brothers of Italy, a party with a neofascist lineage, to guarantee a majority in the event of snap elections.</p> <p>\u201cThe idea of making an agreement with a movement that has attacked me for five years and used fake news against me and my family is difficult to accept, but for the future of your country, you have to put your emotions aside,\u201d Renzi said, referring to the PD\u2019s and the M5S\u2019s years of animosity. \u201cI ask every responsible politician to please, please block this unbelievable [plan] to go to elections. My dream is to help my country avoid the destruction of its economy and institutions, not be the guy who holds the keys to create a government.\u201d</p> <p>A return to the centre stage of Italian politics would be quite a turnaround for a man who crashed out spectacularly two and a half years ago. Renzi had intended the referendum on constitutional reform to lead to an ambitious revamp of the political system, with the aim of making it more stable and efficient. Instead, by promising to quit if he lost the vote, it led only to his own departure from Palazzo Chigi, the prime minister\u2019s residence in Rome, and helped lay the foundations on which the League and M5S prospered.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0af95feefe01d64211789d80bba2d988073c115b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0af95feefe01d64211789d80bba2d988073c115b/0_43_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matteo Salvini meets supporters at the beach in the Sicilian town of Taormina.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matteo Salvini meets supporters at the beach in the Sicilian town of Taormina.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Parrinello/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He had stormed to power in February 2014, nicknamed \u201cIl Rottamatore\u201d \u2013 the Demolition Man, and managed to revive the floundering PD, leading it to over 40% in the European elections that May. He quickly moved to undertake labour market reforms while restoring Italy\u2019s reputation in Brussels. But Renzi made a fateful miscalculation of his popularity during the referendum campaign and became the architect of his own demolition. He remained at the helm of a deeply divided PD until its dismal performance in the March 2018 elections. \u201cInstability is the key word for Italian politics, for three years I tried to change this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe did a lot of reforms and made a lot of difference. OK, we lost the referendum and for sure, made mistakes, especially me. But I am happy about the service we gave.</p> <p>After more than a week of twists and turns and rampant speculation, how things will play out on Tuesday is anyone\u2019s guess. If Conte\u2019s address leads to a confidence vote, it might not take place on that day. He could choose to resign, avoiding the vote. There is also the prospect of Salvini resigning and withdrawing his ministers. The power to dissolve parliament rests with president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/28/sergio-mattarella-italian-president-political-crisis\" title=\"\">Sergio Mattarella,</a> who could seek an alternative majority or call an election. If he chooses the latter, then an election would need to take place within 45 to 70 days. The last time Italians voted in the autumn was in 1919, preceding fascist dictator Benito Mussolini\u2019s acquisition of power in 1922.</p> <p>Renzi believes EU\u2019s fourth-largest economy would go into recession and suffer a VAT rise to 25% if a vote is held so soon. On top of this, a no-deal Brexit in October and Germany\u2019s sluggish economy would compound things in Europe as a whole. Blocking the eurosceptic Salvini could also be Italy\u2019s chance \u201cto return to the political game\u201d in Brussels, Renzi said.</p> <p>There are vast differences between the PD and M5S but the main impediment to them striking a deal is Renzi himself. An accord would need the full support of Zingaretti, who told the <em>Guardian</em> in May that he wouldn\u2019t work with a party sullied by the League. In the middle of last week, he was reportedly warming to the idea, but by Friday denied having any interest in a \u201cpatch-up\u201d government, adding the PD is ready for elections.</p> <p>Meanwhile, rumours on Friday that a damaged Salvini was seeking to patch things up with the M5S, offering Di Maio the premiership, were blasted by M5S as \u201cfake news\u201d.</p> <p>Renzi may have more followers than Salvini on Twitter, and still wields significant influence within the PD, but there is no denying that his popularity was severely dented by the failed referendum. Many Italians balk at the prospect of him being back at the forefront of politics. He is banking, though, that they will balk more at the prospect of prime minister Salvini. \u201cSalvini is weaker, and this showed on Tuesday: for the first time there was a message against his propaganda,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the League won with fake news and propaganda, it will lose with reality and politics.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 19 August 2019 to clarify that Mussolini came to power in 1922 not 1919.</p>",

The League is polling at about 38% and could team up with Brothers of Italy, a party with a neofascist lineage, to guarantee a majority in the event of snap elections. \u201cThe idea of making an agreement with a movement that has attacked me for five years and used fake news against me and my family is difficult to accept, but for the future of your country, you have to put your emotions aside,\u201d Renzi said, referring to the PD\u2019s and the M5S\u2019s years of animosity. \u201cI ask every responsible politician to please, please block this unbelievable [plan] to go to elections. My dream is to help my country avoid the destruction of its economy and institutions, not be the guy who holds the keys to create a government.\u201d A return to the centre stage of Italian politics would be quite a turnaround for a man who crashed out spectacularly two and a half years ago. Renzi had intended the referendum on constitutional reform to lead to an ambitious revamp of the political system, with the aim of making it more stable and efficient. Instead, by promising to quit if he lost the vote, it led only to his own departure from Palazzo Chigi, the prime minister\u2019s residence in Rome, and helped lay the foundations on which the League and M5S prospered. He had stormed to power in February 2014, nicknamed \u201cIl Rottamatore\u201d \u2013 the Demolition Man, and managed to revive the floundering PD, leading it to over 40% in the European elections that May. He quickly moved to undertake labour market reforms while restoring Italy\u2019s reputation in Brussels. But Renzi made a fateful miscalculation of his popularity during the referendum campaign and became the architect of his own demolition. He remained at the helm of a deeply divided PD until its dismal performance in the March 2018 elections. \u201cInstability is the key word for Italian politics, for three years I tried to change this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe did a lot of reforms and made a lot of difference. OK, we lost the referendum and for sure, made mistakes, especially me. But I am happy about the service we gave. After more than a week of twists and turns and rampant speculation, how things will play out on Tuesday is anyone\u2019s guess. If Conte\u2019s address leads to a confidence vote, it might not take place on that day. He could choose to resign, avoiding the vote. There is also the prospect of Salvini resigning and withdrawing his ministers. The power to dissolve parliament rests with president Sergio Mattarella, who could seek an alternative majority or call an election. If he chooses the latter, then an election would need to take place within 45 to 70 days. The last time Italians voted in the autumn was in 1919, preceding fascist dictator Benito Mussolini\u2019s acquisition of power in 1922. Renzi believes EU\u2019s fourth-largest economy would go into recession and suffer a VAT rise to 25% if a vote is held so soon. On top of this, a no-deal Brexit in October and Germany\u2019s sluggish economy would compound things in Europe as a whole. Blocking the eurosceptic Salvini could also be Italy\u2019s chance \u201cto return to the political game\u201d in Brussels, Renzi said. There are vast differences between the PD and M5S but the main impediment to them striking a deal is Renzi himself. An accord would need the full support of Zingaretti, who told the Guardian in May that he wouldn\u2019t work with a party sullied by the League. In the middle of last week, he was reportedly warming to the idea, but by Friday denied having any interest in a \u201cpatch-up\u201d government, adding the PD is ready for elections. Meanwhile, rumours on Friday that a damaged Salvini was seeking to patch things up with the M5S, offering Di Maio the premiership, were blasted by M5S as \u201cfake news\u201d. Renzi may have more followers than Salvini on Twitter, and still wields significant influence within the PD, but there is no denying that his popularity was severely dented by the failed referendum. Many Italians balk at the prospect of him being back at the forefront of politics. He is banking, though, that they will balk more at the prospect of prime minister Salvini. \u201cSalvini is weaker, and this showed on Tuesday: for the first time there was a message against his propaganda,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the League won with fake news and propaganda, it will lose with reality and politics.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 19 August 2019 to clarify that Mussolini came to power in 1922 not 1919.",

Thus the night closes with a tingle of serendipity. Much though Capaldi likes to imply that his success is unexpected, perhaps even undeserved, things so far have a habit of working out for him.",

Her approach grew from a formative period when she returned to Africa to learn about local ceramic practice. <a href=\"https://scva.ac.uk/art-and-artists/exhibitions/magdalene-odundo-the-journey-of-things\" title=\"\">Magdalene Odundo: The Journey of Things</a>, featuring 50 of her works alongside 100 contemporary and historic pieces from all over the world, chosen by the artist, is at the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts, Norwich, until 15 December.</p> <p><strong>Your exhibition brings together works by a number of artists and designers, from Barbara Hepworth to Rodin. How did you choose the objects?</strong><br>They are works I had seen that made me want to find out more about the artist, or coincided with what I was working on. One piece by <a href=\"http://www.kettlesyard.co.uk/collection/collection-database/?artist=4714&amp;title=&amp;type=\" title=\"\">Henri Gaudier-Brzeska</a> is <em>Bird Swallowing a Fish</em>, a sculpture I first saw at Kettle\u2019s Yard [in Cambridge]. In the very early days, when I arrived in this country, I remember it having such a puzzling interest for me. At the time, African art was very popular, in the sense that western artists had been very much influenced by the abstract aspect of the work. I came out thinking: \u201cthis work could be by an African artist, or by somebody who wasn\u2019t western\u201d.</p> <p><strong>You </strong><strong>\u201chand-build\u201d rather than using a wheel \u2013 can you explain th</strong><strong>e technique?</strong><br>Each work originates with a ball of clay which is gradually hollowed out and pulled upwards to create the walls of the pot. Short lengths of coil are added to build height. As each piece rises, it is sculpted individually to create the distinctive silhouettes. Unlike throwing on a wheel, where the piece of clay is worked mechanically and shaped by relatively stable hands, I am the one moving around the work, or moving a turntable to shape each aspect of the form.</p> <p><strong>Your pieces are based on the human form \u2013 why?</strong><br>Using the human form is a very natural way of sculpting with clay. After all, the Bible says that God took clay and used it to form man. It\u2019s something that is within our culture. The first thing you do as a child is get a piece of clay, squeeze it into your hand, add bits and pieces, then draw an eye or a mouth on to it. Clay automatically lends itself to making. It is embodied into the motion of making a body, a person.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k1vWK6EWXk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7k1vWK6EWXk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k1vWK6EWXk\">Watch a trailer for The Journey of Things.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>Describe a typical working day...</strong><br>My wake-up alarm is my radio, tuned to either [the BBC] World Service, Radio 4, 3 or 2. From 8am it\u2019s breakfast, then it\u2019s to my desk, where I change radio stations to Jazz FM, Magic Soul or something lighter, and clear paperwork, answer calls. My older brother and his son are musicians, so I might listen to their music. I prepare clay or make drawings. Making pots tends to take place later in the day, a routine developed when I was looking after my son and teaching, and then finding time in the studio.</p> <p><strong>Ceramics are often described as \u201ccraft\u201d. Do you think this is a helpful definition?</strong><br>For me, crafting work is a term that means you are making work, you are actually crafting a piece of work. There is nothing wrong in making craft; I actually think it\u2019s a very apt word for making, but it\u2019s not helpful when it classifies certain work as not being of equal status to art. When you say you\u2019re a craft person, people just assume that you don\u2019t have the same attributes and the same ability as somebody who is an artist.</p> <p><strong>Do you think the art world takes ceramics seriously?</strong><br>I think it\u2019s beginning to do so. A lot of people from other mediums are now working in clay. This is not surprising, because of all making mediums, clay is the most versatile and pliable and naturally earthly, sympathetic and human. More than any other art, it has crossed the boundaries of disciplines in very interesting ways. You see people like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/richard-deacon\" title=\"\">Richard Deacon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/yayoi-kusama\" title=\"\">Yayoi Kusama</a> using clay. <a href=\"https://www.tony-cragg.com/\" title=\"\">Tony Cragg</a> has used clay for a long time, and his work is very object-oriented. There\u2019s also <a href=\"https://madmuseum.org/exhibition/sterling-ruby-ceramics\" title=\"\">Sterling Ruby</a>.</p> <p>I can\u2019t actually think of anyone who isn\u2019t excited about clay. I mean, look at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/grayson-perry\" title=\"\">Grayson Perry</a>. But I would suggest that if someone is interested in seeing ceramics, they should visit the art school degree shows around the country.</p> <p>\u2022<em> </em><a href=\"https://scva.ac.uk/art-and-artists/exhibitions/magdalene-odundo-the-journey-of-things\" title=\"\">Magdalene Odundo: The Journey of Things</a> is at the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts, Norwich, until 15 December</p>",

Your exhibition brings together works by a number of artists and designers, from Barbara Hepworth to Rodin. How did you choose the objects? They are works I had seen that made me want to find out more about the artist, or coincided with what I was working on. One piece by Henri Gaudier-Brzeska is Bird Swallowing a Fish, a sculpture I first saw at Kettle\u2019s Yard [in Cambridge]. In the very early days, when I arrived in this country, I remember it having such a puzzling interest for me. At the time, African art was very popular, in the sense that western artists had been very much influenced by the abstract aspect of the work. I came out thinking: \u201cthis work could be by an African artist, or by somebody who wasn\u2019t western\u201d. You \u201chand-build\u201d rather than using a wheel \u2013 can you explain the technique? Each work originates with a ball of clay which is gradually hollowed out and pulled upwards to create the walls of the pot. Short lengths of coil are added to build height. As each piece rises, it is sculpted individually to create the distinctive silhouettes. Unlike throwing on a wheel, where the piece of clay is worked mechanically and shaped by relatively stable hands, I am the one moving around the work, or moving a turntable to shape each aspect of the form. Your pieces are based on the human form \u2013 why? Using the human form is a very natural way of sculpting with clay. After all, the Bible says that God took clay and used it to form man. It\u2019s something that is within our culture. The first thing you do as a child is get a piece of clay, squeeze it into your hand, add bits and pieces, then draw an eye or a mouth on to it. Clay automatically lends itself to making. It is embodied into the motion of making a body, a person. Describe a typical working day... My wake-up alarm is my radio, tuned to either [the BBC] World Service, Radio 4, 3 or 2. From 8am it\u2019s breakfast, then it\u2019s to my desk, where I change radio stations to Jazz FM, Magic Soul or something lighter, and clear paperwork, answer calls. My older brother and his son are musicians, so I might listen to their music. I prepare clay or make drawings. Making pots tends to take place later in the day, a routine developed when I was looking after my son and teaching, and then finding time in the studio. Ceramics are often described as \u201ccraft\u201d. Do you think this is a helpful definition? For me, crafting work is a term that means you are making work, you are actually crafting a piece of work. There is nothing wrong in making craft; I actually think it\u2019s a very apt word for making, but it\u2019s not helpful when it classifies certain work as not being of equal status to art. When you say you\u2019re a craft person, people just assume that you don\u2019t have the same attributes and the same ability as somebody who is an artist. Do you think the art world takes ceramics seriously? I think it\u2019s beginning to do so. A lot of people from other mediums are now working in clay. This is not surprising, because of all making mediums, clay is the most versatile and pliable and naturally earthly, sympathetic and human. More than any other art, it has crossed the boundaries of disciplines in very interesting ways. You see people like Richard Deacon and Yayoi Kusama using clay. Tony Cragg has used clay for a long time, and his work is very object-oriented. There\u2019s also Sterling Ruby. I can\u2019t actually think of anyone who isn\u2019t excited about clay. I mean, look at Grayson Perry. But I would suggest that if someone is interested in seeing ceramics, they should visit the art school degree shows around the country. \u2022 Magdalene Odundo: The Journey of Things is at the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts, Norwich, until 15 December",

      "body": "<p>Indignant residents of the Mallorcan town of S\u00f3ller have said their railway is not for sale after a group of investors launched a hostile takeover bid.</p> <p>The town has been linked to the capital, Palma, with a picturesque narrow-gauge railway since 1912. The train, with its wooden carriages, has been in continuous use ever since, climbing 200 metres and passing through 13 tunnels on its 27km journey.</p> <p>Money for building the line was raised among the town\u2019s residents, and to this day most of the 172,000 shares in the private company Ferrocarril de S\u00f3ller are owned by about 800 local people, many of whom hold as few as 10 shares each.</p> <p>S\u00f3ller\u2019s mayor, Carles Simarro, said: \u201cIt would be a shame if the railway lost its unusual status of being owned by hundreds of local citizens.\u201d The railway was part of the \u201cessence of S\u00f3ller\u201d, he said. The bid has come from a group of 10 to 15 anonymous investors, most of them Spanish, represented by Goros Investments. They are reportedly offering \u20ac25m for control of the railway, and the takeover bid, if accepted, would pay the equivalent of 15 years\u2019 worth of dividends.</p> <p>But Jaume Servera, who was mayor of S\u00f3ller until June, said local people were deeply attached to the train and he doubted many would sell. Between them, small investors hold up to 20% of the stock.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of whether the offer is good but whether people want to sell,\u201d Servera said. \u201cFor sentimental reasons, I don\u2019t think the majority of small shareholders will want to. It\u2019s something very entrenched in the life of S\u00f3ller.\u201d</p> <p>The railway\u2019s steam engines, manufactured in Barcelona, were replaced by electric locomotives in 1929.

      "bodyText": "Indignant residents of the Mallorcan town of S\u00f3ller have said their railway is not for sale after a group of investors launched a hostile takeover bid. The town has been linked to the capital, Palma, with a picturesque narrow-gauge railway since 1912. The train, with its wooden carriages, has been in continuous use ever since, climbing 200 metres and passing through 13 tunnels on its 27km journey. Money for building the line was raised among the town\u2019s residents, and to this day most of the 172,000 shares in the private company Ferrocarril de S\u00f3ller are owned by about 800 local people, many of whom hold as few as 10 shares each. S\u00f3ller\u2019s mayor, Carles Simarro, said: \u201cIt would be a shame if the railway lost its unusual status of being owned by hundreds of local citizens.\u201d The railway was part of the \u201cessence of S\u00f3ller\u201d, he said. The bid has come from a group of 10 to 15 anonymous investors, most of them Spanish, represented by Goros Investments. They are reportedly offering \u20ac25m for control of the railway, and the takeover bid, if accepted, would pay the equivalent of 15 years\u2019 worth of dividends. But Jaume Servera, who was mayor of S\u00f3ller until June, said local people were deeply attached to the train and he doubted many would sell. Between them, small investors hold up to 20% of the stock. \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of whether the offer is good but whether people want to sell,\u201d Servera said. \u201cFor sentimental reasons, I don\u2019t think the majority of small shareholders will want to. It\u2019s something very entrenched in the life of S\u00f3ller.\u201d The railway\u2019s steam engines, manufactured in Barcelona, were replaced by electric locomotives in 1929. It now carries about a million passengers a year, most of them tourists. The bidders say they want to improve disabled access, increase traffic, introduce credit card payments and online reservations and offer cheap off-season travel to Mallorcan residents. They also propose new cultural excursions to attract more passengers and claim that the board needs to be shaken up. Shareholders have until 6 September to decide if they wish to accept the offer. Currently the two largest shareholders are a local tour operator and restaurateur and a company that runs boat trips around the north-east of the island.",

This show is one of the unmissable highlights of Edinburgh\u2019s international festival. Hildegarde Bechtler\u2019s sleek set returns us to the world of Ivo van Hove\u2019s astounding <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/mar/26/roman-tragedies-review-barbican-ivo-van-hove-shakespeare\" title=\"\">Roman Tragedies</a></em> (Icke, just finishing as an associate director at the Almeida in London, is often described as Van Hove\u2019s English protege, although he is victoriously his own man, his 2015 <em>Oresteia</em> another theatrical winner). The family likeness between these Dutch productions is unmistakable: Oedipus\u2019s office space recalls Julius Caesar\u2019s in <em>Roman Tragedies</em>. It\u2019s a power hub of sleek lines, swivel chairs and screens that never sleep. Icke\u2019s adaptation begins with footage of Oedipus as a politician, on the eve of a presidential election: \u201cWe are sick,\u201d he tells camera and crowd, \u201cthe state body is sick.\u201d</p> <p>Oedipus is played with magnetic naturalism by Hans Kesting (also Mark Antony in Van Hove\u2019s production). He is relaxed yet wired and, with Creon, a suitably stressed Aus Greidanus Jr, as spin doctor, expected to know the way forward for his country. But before long, the man will cease to know who he is. Knowledge is key as we touch on a familiar question: how much should we know of our politicians\u2019 private lives? The thrilling power of this show is in hearing classical dialogue in a contemporary context. We listen to what Oedipus and his family are feeling. Emotion is pared to the bone, in keeping with the bare lines of the set. There is a visceral inescapability to the talk. And it\u2019s fascinating watching theatre in another language \u2013 you miss the nuances and become hyper-aware of the body language. Dutch, with its vicious Rs, sounds on a dangerous roll (there are subtitles, obviously). One or two shaming English phrases sing out, such as \u201cnew age bullshit\u201d.</p> <p>The cast is first-rate \u2013 flawless. As Jocaste, Marieke Heebink is devastating \u2013 and devastated \u2013 as she spills the details of her past to Oedipus. Frieda Pittoors as Merope, the woman who passes for Oedipus\u2019s mother, is excellent too: a brittle old lady, comically marooned, never parted from her handbag. Tiresias (Hugo Koolschijn) has a weariness in his blindness, and the moment in which he describes the enormous sky and the tininess of human beings is beautifully achieved. The scenes at the family election night dinner are marvellous. You sense the hubris of premature celebration \u2013 the guzzling of champagne, the boasting with mouths full \u2013 and there is a wonderful moment in which the homosexuality of one of Oedipus\u2019s sons is revealed. In Icke\u2019s hands, <em>Oedipus</em> becomes a play about love. But it\u2019s also about accepting your fate.

The fact is, my friends, it\u2019s not very Green. In fact, it\u2019s white \u2013 very, very white. [Cheers] Whiter than white! Green is the new white! [More cheers and chants of \u201cGreen is the new white!\u201d] And what a land mass! It\u2019s the world\u2019s biggest island, my friends! I bet you didn\u2019t know that \u2013 larger than Australia and India put together! And we won\u2019t need to build a wall there. Those waters are cold. [Laughter and applause] People are calling it the greatest deal in American history \u2013 maybe all of history. People are saying that only Trump could have made this deal. Maybe so, I don\u2019t know. I guess it\u2019s true, if everyone is saying it, I mean, I suppose it\u2019s true. All I know is the Dutch paid, what, 60 guilders for Manhattan? I could have gotten it for 30 with Staten Island thrown in.\u201d [Laughter and chants of MAGA! MAGA!] And the Louisiana purchase? Napoleon fleeced Jefferson! 512 million acres for $15m? It sounds like a great deal, but I could have done better, I could have done better. Could have got Texas, too, for not another penny. Now there is one deal I feel bad about. Alaska. Folks, I hate to say it, but we kind of stole it from the Russians. They needed our dollars back in 1867 so we got a lot of land for what \u2013 two cents on the acre. That\u2019s not a deal my friends, that\u2019s robbery. Now you know I\u2019m a good guy, a great guy \u2013 [wild cheers] \u2013 and frankly that deal troubles me. It does. So today, I called my friend Vladimir Putin and said, \u2018Vlad, you can have it back. You can have Alaska back.\u2019\u201d [Cheers and chants of \u201cNo collusion, no obstruction!\u201d] But I\u2019ll tell you something. Crooked Hillary \u2013 [chorus of boos] \u2013 Crooked Hillary, know what she wanted to buy? Haiti! She wanted to make Haiti the 51st state in America. And then she wanted to buy Africa, too, the whole continent. So sad. And criminal. [Chants of \u201cLock her up!] But does the fake news report on this? No. All they say is Trump wants Greenland for its coal. Well, I say to you tonight, \u201cCoal is not a four-letter word!\u201d [Cheers and chants of \u201cDrill, baby, drill\u201d] And the fake news \u2013 they never stop. They say Trump hates the environment. Maybe they should look at my golf courses, the most beautiful courses in the world. I\u2019m probably the biggest environmentalist ever. What did Obama do for Greenland\u2019s penguins? Nothing! I\u2019m going to change all that. I\u2019m going to make sure that nothing happens to so much as one penguin in Greenland. Not one. No one loves the environment like Trump! [Cheers and chants of \u201cPenguins! Penguins!] Nancy Pick is a writer based in western Massachusetts.",

Jones caused widespread anger on Thursday after using his 2GB show to tell the Australian prime minister to carry out the action to stop Ardern talking about climate change. \u201cNotwithstanding his apologies, I have today discussed the matter with Alan and advised him that any recurrence of commentary of this nature will result in the termination of his contract,\u201d the Macquarie Media chairman, Russell Tate, said on Saturday night. The tough warning from Tate came after big advertisers including Snooze, Sleep City, ME Bank and Big W pulled advertising from Jones\u2019s popular morning show in protest, alerted by social media campaigns led by Facebook group Mad Fucking Witches which has 48,000 members and Sleeping Giants on Twitter. Jones apologised on Friday but only after first doubling down on his original comments and calling Ardern \u201cgormless\u201d and a \u201chypocrite\u201d. \u201cEarlier today I did write to the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda [Ardern],\u201d Jones said. \u201cAmongst other things I said \u2026 I would never wish her any harm and would always wish her the best.\u201d He said his comments were nevertheless careless and \u201cshould have been more clearly thought\u201d. \u201cI have erred and made a mistake\u201d. On Saturday, Tate said Jones recognised that his comments were wrong. \u201cHe indicated that he had apologised sincerely to Prime Minister Ardern for any offence given, and had certainly not intended to suggest any harm through his comments,\u201d Tate said. Morrison was in Tuvalu with Ardern for the Pacific Islands Forum, where the New Zealand PM had said Australia would have to \u201canswer to the Pacific\u201d for its inaction on climate change. The warning about Jones\u2019s behaviour comes in the same week Nine moved to take complete control of Macquarie and assured the talkback talent it would be business as usual under the new owners. Nine said it wouldn\u2019t change the \u201cbold\u201d 2GB line-up if the $113.94m offer to acquire the remaining shares in Macquarie Media was accepted. Jones signed a new contract in May after months of tense negotiations because of defamation payouts the company has had to make. He hosts the breakfast slot on 2GB in Sydney and 4BC in Brisbane and has a two-year contract which ends in July 2021. \u201cWith Alan\u2019s current ratings share of the Sydney radio audience amongst the highest it has ever been, his dominance shows no sign of slowing down,\u201d Tate said when he signed the new contract for the 78-year-old.",

A momentous river of garbage rolls down the conveyor: cardboard boxes, splintered skirting board, plastic bottles, crisp packets, DVD cases, printer cartridges, countless newspapers, including this one. Odd bits of junk catch the eye, conjuring little vignettes: a single discarded glove. A crushed Tupperware container, the meal inside uneaten. A photograph of a smiling child on an adult\u2019s shoulders. But they are gone in a moment. The line at Green Recycling handles up to 12 tonnes of waste an hour.</p> <p>\u201cWe produce 200 to 300 tonnes a day,\u201d says Jamie Smith, Green Recycling\u2019s general manager, above the din. We are standing three storeys up on the green health-and-safety gangway, looking down the line. On the tipping floor, an excavator is grabbing clawfuls of trash from heaps and piling it into a spinning drum, which spreads it evenly across the conveyor. Along the belt, human workers pick and channel what is valuable (bottles, cardboard, aluminium cans) into sorting chutes.</p> <p>\u201cOur main products are paper, cardboard, plastic bottles, mixed plastics, and wood,\u201d says Smith, 40. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a significant rise in boxes, thanks to Amazon.\u201d By the end of the line, the torrent has become a trickle. The waste stands stacked neatly in bales, ready to be loaded on to trucks. From there, it will go \u2013 well, that is when it gets complicated.</p> <p>You drink a Coca-Cola, throw the bottle into the recycling, put the bins out on collection day and forget about it. But it doesn\u2019t disappear. Everything you own will one day become the property of this, the waste industry, a <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-global-waste-management-market-size-is-expected-to-reach-484-9-billion-by-2025-from-303-6-billion-in-2017--growing-at-a-cagr-of-6-0-from-2018-to-2025--300874655.html\" title=\"\">\u00a3250bn global enterprise</a> determined to extract every last penny of value from what remains. It starts with materials recovery facilities (MRFs) such as this one, which sort waste into its constituent parts. From there, the materials enter a labyrinthine network of brokers and traders. Some of that happens in the UK, but much of it \u2013 about half of all paper and cardboard, and two-thirds of plastics \u2013 will be loaded on to container ships to be sent to Europe or Asia for recycling. Paper and cardboard goes to mills; glass is washed and re-used or smashed and melted, like metal and plastic. Food, and anything else, is burned or sent to landfill.</p> <p>Or, at least, that\u2019s how it used to work. Then, on the first day of 2018, China, the world\u2019s largest market for recycled waste, essentially shut its doors. Under its National Sword policy, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/02/rubbish-already-building-up-at-uk-recycling-plants-due-to-china-import-ban\" title=\"\">China prohibited 24 types of waste from entering the country</a>, arguing that what was coming in was too contaminated. The policy shift was partly attributed to the impact of a documentary,<a href=\"https://www.plasticchina.org/\" title=\"\"> Plastic China</a>, which went viral before censors erased it from China\u2019s internet. The film follows a family working in the country\u2019s recycling industry, where humans pick through vast dunes of western waste, shredding and melting salvageable plastic into pellets that can be sold to manufacturers. It is filthy, polluting work \u2013 and badly paid. The remainder is often burned in the open air. The family lives alongside the sorting machine, their 11-year-old daughter playing with a Barbie pulled from the rubbish.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Westminster council sent 82% of all household waste \u2013 including that put in recycling bins \u2013 for incineration in 2017/18</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For recyclers such as Smith, National Sword was a huge blow. \u201cThe price of cardboard has probably halved in the last 12 months,\u201d he says. \u201cThe price of plastics has plummeted to the extent that it isn\u2019t worth recycling. If China doesn\u2019t take plastic, we can\u2019t sell it.\u201d Still, that waste has to go somewhere. The UK, like most developed nations, produces more waste than it can process at home: <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/uk-waste-data\" title=\"\">230m tonnes a year</a><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/uk-waste-data\" title=\"\"> \u2013 </a><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/uk-waste-data\" title=\"\">about 1.1kg per person per day</a>. (The US, the world\u2019s most wasteful nation, produces 2kg per person per day.) Quickly, the market began flooding any country that would take the trash: Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, countries with some of the world\u2019s highest rates of what researchers call \u201cwaste mismanagement\u201d \u2013 rubbish left or burned in open landfills, illegal sites or facilities with inadequate reporting, making its final fate difficult to trace.</p> <p>The present dumping ground of choice is Malaysia. In October last year, a <a href=\"https://unearthed.greenpeace.org/2018/10/21/uk-household-plastics-found-in-illegal-dumps-in-malaysia/\" title=\"\">Greenpeace Unearthed investigation</a> found mountains of British and European waste in illegal dumps there: Tesco crisp packets, Flora tubs and recycling collection bags from three London councils. As in China, the waste is often burned or abandoned, eventually finding its way into rivers and oceans. In May, the Malaysian government began turning back container ships, citing public health concerns. Thailand and India have announced bans on the import of foreign plastic waste. But still the rubbish flows.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1681dc08d17c1159ba61f43753e72b5a32a934d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1681dc08d17c1159ba61f43753e72b5a32a934d3/50_1443_5238_3143/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Plastic waste ready for inspection before being sent to Malaysia; the UK produces more refuse than it can process at home \u2013 about 1.1kg per person per day.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Plastic waste ready for inspection before being sent to Malaysia; the UK produces more refuse than it can process at home \u2013 about 1.1kg per person per day.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We want our waste hidden. Green Recycling is tucked away at the end of an industrial estate, surrounded by sound-deflecting metal boards. Outside, a machine called an Air Spectrum masks the acrid odour with the smell of cotton bedsheets. But, all of a sudden, the industry is under intense scrutiny. In the UK, recycling rates have stagnated in recent years, while National Sword and funding cuts have led to more waste being burned in incinerators and energy-from-waste plants. (Incineration, while often criticised for being polluting and an inefficient source of energy, is today preferred to landfill, which emits methane and can leach toxic chemicals.) Westminster council sent 82% of all household waste \u2013 including that put in recycling bins \u2013 for incineration in 2017/18. Some councils have debated giving up recycling altogether. And yet the UK is a successful recycling nation: 45.7% of all household waste is classed as recycled (although that number indicates only that it is sent for recycling, not where it ends up.) In the US, that figure is 25.8%.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One of the UK\u2019s largest waste companies, attempted to ship used nappies abroad in consignments marked as waste paper</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If you look at plastics, the picture is even bleaker. Of the 8.3bn tonnes of virgin plastic produced worldwide, only 9% has been recycled, according to a <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318567844_Production_use_and_fate_of_all_plastics_ever_made\" title=\"\">2017 Science Advances paper</a> entitled Production, Use And Fate Of All Plastics Ever Made. \u201cI think the best global estimate is maybe we\u2019re at 20% [per year] globally right now,\u201d says Roland Geyer, its lead author, a professor of industrial ecology at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Academics and NGOs doubt those numbers, due to the uncertain fate of our waste exports. In June, one of the UK\u2019s largest waste companies, Biffa, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/25/uk-waste-firm-exported-offensive-materials-including-used-nappies\" title=\"\">found guilty of attempting to ship </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/25/uk-waste-firm-exported-offensive-materials-including-used-nappies\" title=\"\">used nappies, sanitary towels and clothing</a> abroad in consignments marked as waste paper. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of creative accounting going on to push the numbers up,\u201d Geyer says.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really a complete myth when people say that we\u2019re recycling our plastics,\u201d says Jim Puckett, the executive director of the Seattle-based <a href=\"https://www.ban.org/\" title=\"\">Basel Action Network</a>, which campaigns against the illegal waste trade. \u201cIt all sounded good. \u2018It\u2019s going to be recycled in China!\u2019 I hate to break it to everyone, but these places are routinely dumping massive amounts of [that] plastic and burning it on open fires.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>Recycling is as old as thrift. The Japanese were recycling paper in the 11th century; medieval blacksmiths made armour from scrap metal. During the second world war, scrap metal was made into tanks and women\u2019s nylons into parachutes. \u201cThe trouble started when, in the late 70s, we began trying to recycle household waste,\u201d says Geyer. This was contaminated with all sorts of undesirables: non-recyclable materials, food waste, oils and liquids that rot and spoil the bales.</p> <p>At the same time, the packaging industry flooded our homes with cheap plastic: tubs, films, bottles, individually shrink-wrapped vegetables. Plastic is where recycling gets most controversial. Recycling aluminium, say, is straightforward, profitable and environmentally sound: making a can from recycled aluminium reduces its carbon footprint by up to 95%. But with plastic, it is not that simple. While virtually all plastics can be recycled, many aren\u2019t because the process is expensive, complicated and the resulting product is of lower quality than what you put in. The carbon-reduction benefits are also less clear. \u201cYou ship it around, then you have to wash it, then you have to chop it up, then you have to re-melt it, so the collection and recycling itself has its own environmental impact,\u201d says Geyer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc5ac761808be733f32db6cfae600ca614cc2f6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc5ac761808be733f32db6cfae600ca614cc2f6e/4_397_4080_2448/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A materials recovery facility in Milton Keynes where waste is sorted.

In the UK, there are 28 different recycling labels that can appear on packaging.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Household recycling requires sorting at a vast scale. This is why most developed countries have colour-coded bins: to keep the end product as pure as possible. In the UK, <a href=\"https://www.recyclenow.com/recycling-knowledge/packaging-symbols-explained\" title=\"\">Recycle Now</a> lists 28 different recycling labels that can appear on packaging. There is the mobius loop (three twisted arrows), which indicates a product can technically be recycled; sometimes that symbol contains a number between one and seven, indicating the plastic resin from which the object is made. There is the green dot (two green arrows embracing), which indicates that the producer has contributed to a European recycling scheme. There are labels that say \u201cWidely Recycled\u201d (acceptable by 75% of local councils) and \u201cCheck Local Recycling\u201d (between 20% and 75% of councils).</p> <p>Since National Sword, sorting has become even more crucial, as overseas markets demand higher-quality material. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to be the world\u2019s dumping ground, quite rightly,\u201d Smith says, as we walk along the Green Recycling line. About halfway, four women in hi-vis and caps pull out large chunks of cardboard and plastic films, which machines struggle with. There is a low rumble in the air and a thick layer of dust on the gangway. Green Recycling is a commercial MRF: it takes waste from schools, colleges and local businesses. That means lower volume, but better margins, as the company can charge clients directly and maintain control over what it collects. \u201cThe business is all about turning straw into gold,\u201d says Smith, referencing Rumpelstiltskin. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard \u2013 and it\u2019s become a lot harder.\u201d</p> <p>Towards the end of the line is the machine that Smith hopes will change that. Last year, Green Recycling became the first MRF in the UK to invest in Max, <a href=\"https://www.max-ai.com/video-max-ai-autonomous-qc/\" title=\"\">a US-made, artificially intelligent sorting machine</a>. Inside a large clear box over the conveyor, a robotic suction arm marked FlexPickerTM is zipping back and forth over the belt, picking tirelessly. \u201cHe\u2019s looking for plastic bottles first,\u201d Smith says. \u201cHe does 60 picks a minute. Humans will pick between 20 and 40, on a good day.\u201d A camera system identifies the waste rolling by, displaying a detailed breakdown on a nearby screen. The machine is intended not to replace humans, but to augment them. \u201cHe\u2019s picking three tonnes of waste a day that otherwise our human guys would have to leave,\u201d Smith says. In fact, the robot has created a new human job to maintain it: this is done by Danielle, whom the crew refer to as \u201cMax\u2019s mum\u201d. The benefits of automation, Smith says, are twofold: more material to sell and less waste that the company needs to pay to have burned afterwards. Margins are thin and landfill tax is \u00a391 a tonne.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Smith is not alone in putting his faith in technology. With consumers and the government outraged at the plastics crisis, the waste industry is scrambling to solve the problem. One great hope is chemical recycling: turning problem plastics into oil or gas through industrial processes. \u201cIt recycles the kind of plastics that mechanical recycling can\u2019t look at: the pouches, the sachets, the black plastics,\u201d says Adrian Griffiths, the founder of Swindon-based Recycling Technologies. The idea found its way to Griffiths, a former management consultant, by accident, after a mistake in a Warwick University press release. \u201cThey said they could turn any old plastic back into a monomer. At the time, they couldn\u2019t,\u201d Griffiths says. Intrigued, Griffiths got in touch. He ended up partnering with the researchers to launch a company that could do this.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>By moving from disposable to reusable, you unlock epic design opportunities</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At Recycling Technologies\u2019 pilot plant in Swindon, plastic (Griffiths says it can process any type) is fed into a towering steel cracking chamber, where it is separated at extremely high temperatures into gas and an oil, <a href=\"https://recyclingtechnologies.co.uk/technology/plaxx/\" title=\"\">plaxx</a>, which can be used as a fuel or feedstock for new plastic. While the global mood has turned against plastic, Griffiths is a rare defender of it. \u201cPlastic packaging has actually done an incredible service for the world, because it has reduced the amount of glass, metal and paper that we were using,\u201d he says. \u201cThe thing that worries me more than the plastic problem is global warming. If you use more glass, more metal, those materials have a much higher carbon footprint.\u201d The company recently launched a trial scheme with Tesco and is already working on a second facility, in Scotland. Eventually, Griffiths hopes to sell the machines to recycling facilities worldwide. \u201cWe need to stop shipping recycling abroad,\u201d he says. \u201cNo civilised society should be getting rid of its waste to a developing country.\u201d</p> <p>There is cause for optimism: in December 2018, the UK government published <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/18/packaging-producers-to-pay-full-recycling-costs-under-waste-scheme\" title=\"\">a comprehensive new waste strategy</a>, partly in response to National Sword. Among its proposals: a tax on plastic packaging containing less than 30% recycled material; a simplified labelling system; and means to force companies to take responsibility for the plastic packaging they produce. They hope to force the industry to invest in recycling infrastructure at home. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the industry is being forced to adapt: in May, 186 countries passed measures to track and control the export of plastic waste to developing countries, while more than 350 companies have signed a global commitment to eliminate the use of single-use plastics by 2025.</p> <p>Yet such is the torrent of humanity\u2019s refuse that these efforts may not be enough. Recycling rates in the west are stalling and packaging use is set to soar in developing countries, where recycling rates are low. If National Sword has shown us anything, it is that recycling \u2013 while needed \u2013 simply isn\u2019t enough to solve our waste crisis.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Perhaps there is an alternative. Since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/29/blue-planet-ii-review-extraordinary-brilliant-bird-eating-fish-dolphins-otters\" title=\"\">Blue Planet II</a> brought the plastic crisis to our attention, a dying trade is having a resurgence in Britain: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/07/return-milkround-plastic-problem-glass-bottle-deliveries\" title=\"\">the milkman</a>. More of us are choosing to have milk bottles delivered, collected and re-used. Similar models are springing up: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/21/the-zero-waste-revolution-how-a-new-wave-of-shops-could-end-excess-packaging\" title=\"\">zero-waste shops that require you to bring your own containers</a>; the boom in refillable cups and bottles. It is as if we have remembered that the old environmental slogan \u201cReduce, re-use, recycle\u201d wasn\u2019t only catchy, but listed in order of preference.</p> <p>Tom Szaky wants to apply the milkman model to almost everything you buy. The bearded, shaggy-haired Hungarian-Canadian is a veteran of the waste industry: he founded his first recycling startup as a student at Princeton, selling worm-based fertiliser out of re-used bottles. That company, TerraCycle, is now a recycling giant, with operations in 21 countries. In 2017, TerraCycle worked with Head &amp; Shoulders on a shampoo bottle made from recycled ocean plastics. The product launched at the World Economic Forum in Davos and was an immediate hit. Proctor &amp; Gamble, which makes Head &amp; Shoulders, was keen to know what was next, so Szaky pitched something far more ambitious.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/terracycle-loop-zero-waste-products-procter-gamble-nestle-household-brands-expanding/\" title=\"\">The result </a><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/terracycle-loop-zero-waste-products-procter-gamble-nestle-household-brands-expanding/\" title=\"\">is Loop</a>, which launched trials in France and the US this spring and will arrive in Britain this winter. It offers a variety of household products \u2013 from manufacturers including P&amp;G, Unilever, Nestl\u00e9 and Coca-Cola \u2013 in reusable packaging. The items are available online or through exclusive retailers. Customers pay a small deposit, and the used containers are eventually collected by a courier or dropped off in store (Walgreens in the US, Tesco in the UK), washed, and sent back to the producer to be refilled. \u201cLoop is a not a product company; it\u2019s a waste management company,\u201d says Szaky. \u201cWe\u2019re just looking at waste before it begins.\u201d</p> <p>Many of the Loop designs are familiar: refillable glass bottles of Coca-Cola and Tropicana; aluminium bottles of Pantene. But others are being rethought entirely. \u201cBy moving from disposable to reusable, you unlock epic design opportunities,\u201d says Szaky. For example: Unilever is working on toothpaste tablets that dissolve into paste under running water; H\u00e4agen-Dazs ice-cream comes in a stainless steel tub that stays cold long enough for picnics. Even the deliveries come in a specially designed insulated bag, to cut down on cardboard.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6930479e5ebf068e96c8f6921b4ec3455ec3bb6d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6930479e5ebf068e96c8f6921b4ec3455ec3bb6d/0_15_1920_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"At Recycling Technologies in Swindon, nearly all plastics can be turned into plaxx, an oil that can be used to make new plastic.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At Recycling Technologies in Swindon, nearly all plastics can be turned into plaxx, an oil that can be used to make new plastic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Recycling Technologies Ltd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tina Hill, a Paris-based copywriter, signed up to Loop soon after its launch in France. \u201cIt\u2019s super-easy,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a small deposit, \u20ac3 [per container]. What I like about it is that they have things I already use: olive oil, washing pods.\u201d Hill describes herself as \u201cpretty green: we recycle anything that can be recycled, we buy organic\u201d. By combining Loop with shopping at local zero-waste stores, Hills has helped her family radically reduce its reliance on single-use packaging. \u201cThe only downside is that the prices can be a little high. We don\u2019t mind spending a little bit more to support the things that you believe in, but on some things, like pasta, it\u2019s prohibitive.\u201d</p> <p>A major advantage to Loop\u2019s business model, Szaky says, is that it forces packaging designers to prioritise durability over disposability. In future, Szaky anticipates that Loop will be able to email users warnings for expiry dates and other advice to reduce their waste footprint. The milkman model is about more than just the bottle: it makes us think about what we consume and what we throw away. \u201cGarbage is something that we want out of sight and mind \u2013 it\u2019s dirty, it\u2019s gross, it smells bad,\u201d says Szaky.</p> <p>That is what needs to change. It is tempting to see plastic piled up in Malaysian landfills and assume recycling is a waste of time, but that isn\u2019t true. In the UK, recycling is largely a success story, and the alternatives \u2013 burning our waste or burying it \u2013 are worse. Instead of giving up on recycling, Szaky says, we should all use less, re-use what we can and treat our waste like the waste industry sees it: as a resource. Not the ending of something, but the beginning of something else.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t call it waste; we call it materials,\u201d says Green Recycling\u2019s Smith, back in Maldon. Down in the yard, a haulage truck is being loaded with 35 bales of sorted cardboard. From here, Smith will send it to a mill in Kent for pulping. It will be new cardboard boxes within the fortnight \u2013 and someone else\u2019s rubbish soon after.</p> <p>\u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email <a href=\"mailto:\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

      "bodyText": "An alarm sounds, the blockage is cleared, and the line at Green Recycling in Maldon, Essex, rumbles back into life. A momentous river of garbage rolls down the conveyor: cardboard boxes, splintered skirting board, plastic bottles, crisp packets, DVD cases, printer cartridges, countless newspapers, including this one. Odd bits of junk catch the eye, conjuring little vignettes: a single discarded glove. A crushed Tupperware container, the meal inside uneaten. A photograph of a smiling child on an adult\u2019s shoulders. But they are gone in a moment. The line at Green Recycling handles up to 12 tonnes of waste an hour. \u201cWe produce 200 to 300 tonnes a day,\u201d says Jamie Smith, Green Recycling\u2019s general manager, above the din. We are standing three storeys up on the green health-and-safety gangway, looking down the line. On the tipping floor, an excavator is grabbing clawfuls of trash from heaps and piling it into a spinning drum, which spreads it evenly across the conveyor. Along the belt, human workers pick and channel what is valuable (bottles, cardboard, aluminium cans) into sorting chutes. \u201cOur main products are paper, cardboard, plastic bottles, mixed plastics, and wood,\u201d says Smith, 40. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a significant rise in boxes, thanks to Amazon.\u201d By the end of the line, the torrent has become a trickle. The waste stands stacked neatly in bales, ready to be loaded on to trucks. From there, it will go \u2013 well, that is when it gets complicated. You drink a Coca-Cola, throw the bottle into the recycling, put the bins out on collection day and forget about it. But it doesn\u2019t disappear. Everything you own will one day become the property of this, the waste industry, a \u00a3250bn global enterprise determined to extract every last penny of value from what remains. It starts with materials recovery facilities (MRFs) such as this one, which sort waste into its constituent parts. From there, the materials enter a labyrinthine network of brokers and traders. Some of that happens in the UK, but much of it \u2013 about half of all paper and cardboard, and two-thirds of plastics \u2013 will be loaded on to container ships to be sent to Europe or Asia for recycling. Paper and cardboard goes to mills; glass is washed and re-used or smashed and melted, like metal and plastic. Food, and anything else, is burned or sent to landfill. Or, at least, that\u2019s how it used to work. Then, on the first day of 2018, China, the world\u2019s largest market for recycled waste, essentially shut its doors. Under its National Sword policy, China prohibited 24 types of waste from entering the country, arguing that what was coming in was too contaminated. The policy shift was partly attributed to the impact of a documentary, Plastic China, which went viral before censors erased it from China\u2019s internet. The film follows a family working in the country\u2019s recycling industry, where humans pick through vast dunes of western waste, shredding and melting salvageable plastic into pellets that can be sold to manufacturers. It is filthy, polluting work \u2013 and badly paid. The remainder is often burned in the open air. The family lives alongside the sorting machine, their 11-year-old daughter playing with a Barbie pulled from the rubbish. For recyclers such as Smith, National Sword was a huge blow. \u201cThe price of cardboard has probably halved in the last 12 months,\u201d he says. \u201cThe price of plastics has plummeted to the extent that it isn\u2019t worth recycling. If China doesn\u2019t take plastic, we can\u2019t sell it.\u201d Still, that waste has to go somewhere. The UK, like most developed nations, produces more waste than it can process at home: 230m tonnes a year \u2013 about 1.1kg per person per day. (The US, the world\u2019s most wasteful nation, produces 2kg per person per day.) Quickly, the market began flooding any country that would take the trash: Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, countries with some of the world\u2019s highest rates of what researchers call \u201cwaste mismanagement\u201d \u2013 rubbish left or burned in open landfills, illegal sites or facilities with inadequate reporting, making its final fate difficult to trace. The present dumping ground of choice is Malaysia. In October last year, a Greenpeace Unearthed investigation found mountains of British and European waste in illegal dumps there: Tesco crisp packets, Flora tubs and recycling collection bags from three London councils. As in China, the waste is often burned or abandoned, eventually finding its way into rivers and oceans. In May, the Malaysian government began turning back container ships, citing public health concerns. Thailand and India have announced bans on the import of foreign plastic waste. But still the rubbish flows. We want our waste hidden. Green Recycling is tucked away at the end of an industrial estate, surrounded by sound-deflecting metal boards. Outside, a machine called an Air Spectrum masks the acrid odour with the smell of cotton bedsheets. But, all of a sudden, the industry is under intense scrutiny. In the UK, recycling rates have stagnated in recent years, while National Sword and funding cuts have led to more waste being burned in incinerators and energy-from-waste plants. (Incineration, while often criticised for being polluting and an inefficient source of energy, is today preferred to landfill, which emits methane and can leach toxic chemicals.) Westminster council sent 82% of all household waste \u2013 including that put in recycling bins \u2013 for incineration in 2017/18. Some councils have debated giving up recycling altogether. And yet the UK is a successful recycling nation: 45.7% of all household waste is classed as recycled (although that number indicates only that it is sent for recycling, not where it ends up.) In the US, that figure is 25.8%. If you look at plastics, the picture is even bleaker. Of the 8.3bn tonnes of virgin plastic produced worldwide, only 9% has been recycled, according to a 2017 Science Advances paper entitled Production, Use And Fate Of All Plastics Ever Made. \u201cI think the best global estimate is maybe we\u2019re at 20% [per year] globally right now,\u201d says Roland Geyer, its lead author, a professor of industrial ecology at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Academics and NGOs doubt those numbers, due to the uncertain fate of our waste exports. In June, one of the UK\u2019s largest waste companies, Biffa, was found guilty of attempting to ship used nappies, sanitary towels and clothing abroad in consignments marked as waste paper. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of creative accounting going on to push the numbers up,\u201d Geyer says. \u201cIt\u2019s really a complete myth when people say that we\u2019re recycling our plastics,\u201d says Jim Puckett, the executive director of the Seattle-based Basel Action Network, which campaigns against the illegal waste trade. \u201cIt all sounded good. \u2018It\u2019s going to be recycled in China!\u2019 I hate to break it to everyone, but these places are routinely dumping massive amounts of [that] plastic and burning it on open fires.\u201d *** Recycling is as old as thrift. The Japanese were recycling paper in the 11th century; medieval blacksmiths made armour from scrap metal. During the second world war, scrap metal was made into tanks and women\u2019s nylons into parachutes. \u201cThe trouble started when, in the late 70s, we began trying to recycle household waste,\u201d says Geyer. This was contaminated with all sorts of undesirables: non-recyclable materials, food waste, oils and liquids that rot and spoil the bales. At the same time, the packaging industry flooded our homes with cheap plastic: tubs, films, bottles, individually shrink-wrapped vegetables. Plastic is where recycling gets most controversial. Recycling aluminium, say, is straightforward, profitable and environmentally sound: making a can from recycled aluminium reduces its carbon footprint by up to 95%. But with plastic, it is not that simple. While virtually all plastics can be recycled, many aren\u2019t because the process is expensive, complicated and the resulting product is of lower quality than what you put in. The carbon-reduction benefits are also less clear. \u201cYou ship it around, then you have to wash it, then you have to chop it up, then you have to re-melt it, so the collection and recycling itself has its own environmental impact,\u201d says Geyer. Household recycling requires sorting at a vast scale. This is why most developed countries have colour-coded bins: to keep the end product as pure as possible. In the UK, Recycle Now lists 28 different recycling labels that can appear on packaging. There is the mobius loop (three twisted arrows), which indicates a product can technically be recycled; sometimes that symbol contains a number between one and seven, indicating the plastic resin from which the object is made. There is the green dot (two green arrows embracing), which indicates that the producer has contributed to a European recycling scheme. There are labels that say \u201cWidely Recycled\u201d (acceptable by 75% of local councils) and \u201cCheck Local Recycling\u201d (between 20% and 75% of councils). Since National Sword, sorting has become even more crucial, as overseas markets demand higher-quality material. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to be the world\u2019s dumping ground, quite rightly,\u201d Smith says, as we walk along the Green Recycling line. About halfway, four women in hi-vis and caps pull out large chunks of cardboard and plastic films, which machines struggle with. There is a low rumble in the air and a thick layer of dust on the gangway. Green Recycling is a commercial MRF: it takes waste from schools, colleges and local businesses. That means lower volume, but better margins, as the company can charge clients directly and maintain control over what it collects. \u201cThe business is all about turning straw into gold,\u201d says Smith, referencing Rumpelstiltskin. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard \u2013 and it\u2019s become a lot harder.\u201d Towards the end of the line is the machine that Smith hopes will change that. Last year, Green Recycling became the first MRF in the UK to invest in Max, a US-made, artificially intelligent sorting machine. Inside a large clear box over the conveyor, a robotic suction arm marked FlexPickerTM is zipping back and forth over the belt, picking tirelessly. \u201cHe\u2019s looking for plastic bottles first,\u201d Smith says. \u201cHe does 60 picks a minute. Humans will pick between 20 and 40, on a good day.\u201d A camera system identifies the waste rolling by, displaying a detailed breakdown on a nearby screen. The machine is intended not to replace humans, but to augment them. \u201cHe\u2019s picking three tonnes of waste a day that otherwise our human guys would have to leave,\u201d Smith says. In fact, the robot has created a new human job to maintain it: this is done by Danielle, whom the crew refer to as \u201cMax\u2019s mum\u201d. The benefits of automation, Smith says, are twofold: more material to sell and less waste that the company needs to pay to have burned afterwards. Margins are thin and landfill tax is \u00a391 a tonne. *** Smith is not alone in putting his faith in technology. With consumers and the government outraged at the plastics crisis, the waste industry is scrambling to solve the problem. One great hope is chemical recycling: turning problem plastics into oil or gas through industrial processes. \u201cIt recycles the kind of plastics that mechanical recycling can\u2019t look at: the pouches, the sachets, the black plastics,\u201d says Adrian Griffiths, the founder of Swindon-based Recycling Technologies. The idea found its way to Griffiths, a former management consultant, by accident, after a mistake in a Warwick University press release. \u201cThey said they could turn any old plastic back into a monomer. At the time, they couldn\u2019t,\u201d Griffiths says. Intrigued, Griffiths got in touch. He ended up partnering with the researchers to launch a company that could do this. At Recycling Technologies\u2019 pilot plant in Swindon, plastic (Griffiths says it can process any type) is fed into a towering steel cracking chamber, where it is separated at extremely high temperatures into gas and an oil, plaxx, which can be used as a fuel or feedstock for new plastic. While the global mood has turned against plastic, Griffiths is a rare defender of it. \u201cPlastic packaging has actually done an incredible service for the world, because it has reduced the amount of glass, metal and paper that we were using,\u201d he says. \u201cThe thing that worries me more than the plastic problem is global warming. If you use more glass, more metal, those materials have a much higher carbon footprint.\u201d The company recently launched a trial scheme with Tesco and is already working on a second facility, in Scotland. Eventually, Griffiths hopes to sell the machines to recycling facilities worldwide. \u201cWe need to stop shipping recycling abroad,\u201d he says. \u201cNo civilised society should be getting rid of its waste to a developing country.\u201d There is cause for optimism: in December 2018, the UK government published a comprehensive new waste strategy, partly in response to National Sword. Among its proposals: a tax on plastic packaging containing less than 30% recycled material; a simplified labelling system; and means to force companies to take responsibility for the plastic packaging they produce. They hope to force the industry to invest in recycling infrastructure at home. Meanwhile, the industry is being forced to adapt: in May, 186 countries passed measures to track and control the export of plastic waste to developing countries, while more than 350 companies have signed a global commitment to eliminate the use of single-use plastics by 2025. Yet such is the torrent of humanity\u2019s refuse that these efforts may not be enough. Recycling rates in the west are stalling and packaging use is set to soar in developing countries, where recycling rates are low. If National Sword has shown us anything, it is that recycling \u2013 while needed \u2013 simply isn\u2019t enough to solve our waste crisis. *** Perhaps there is an alternative. Since Blue Planet II brought the plastic crisis to our attention, a dying trade is having a resurgence in Britain: the milkman. More of us are choosing to have milk bottles delivered, collected and re-used. Similar models are springing up: zero-waste shops that require you to bring your own containers; the boom in refillable cups and bottles. It is as if we have remembered that the old environmental slogan \u201cReduce, re-use, recycle\u201d wasn\u2019t only catchy, but listed in order of preference. Tom Szaky wants to apply the milkman model to almost everything you buy. The bearded, shaggy-haired Hungarian-Canadian is a veteran of the waste industry: he founded his first recycling startup as a student at Princeton, selling worm-based fertiliser out of re-used bottles. That company, TerraCycle, is now a recycling giant, with operations in 21 countries. In 2017, TerraCycle worked with Head &amp; Shoulders on a shampoo bottle made from recycled ocean plastics. The product launched at the World Economic Forum in Davos and was an immediate hit. Proctor &amp; Gamble, which makes Head &amp; Shoulders, was keen to know what was next, so Szaky pitched something far more ambitious. The result is Loop, which launched trials in France and the US this spring and will arrive in Britain this winter. It offers a variety of household products \u2013 from manufacturers including P&amp;G, Unilever, Nestl\u00e9 and Coca-Cola \u2013 in reusable packaging. The items are available online or through exclusive retailers. Customers pay a small deposit, and the used containers are eventually collected by a courier or dropped off in store (Walgreens in the US, Tesco in the UK), washed, and sent back to the producer to be refilled. \u201cLoop is a not a product company; it\u2019s a waste management company,\u201d says Szaky. \u201cWe\u2019re just looking at waste before it begins.\u201d Many of the Loop designs are familiar: refillable glass bottles of Coca-Cola and Tropicana; aluminium bottles of Pantene. But others are being rethought entirely. \u201cBy moving from disposable to reusable, you unlock epic design opportunities,\u201d says Szaky. For example: Unilever is working on toothpaste tablets that dissolve into paste under running water; H\u00e4agen-Dazs ice-cream comes in a stainless steel tub that stays cold long enough for picnics. Even the deliveries come in a specially designed insulated bag, to cut down on cardboard. Tina Hill, a Paris-based copywriter, signed up to Loop soon after its launch in France. \u201cIt\u2019s super-easy,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a small deposit, \u20ac3 [per container]. What I like about it is that they have things I already use: olive oil, washing pods.\u201d Hill describes herself as \u201cpretty green: we recycle anything that can be recycled, we buy organic\u201d. By combining Loop with shopping at local zero-waste stores, Hills has helped her family radically reduce its reliance on single-use packaging. \u201cThe only downside is that the prices can be a little high. We don\u2019t mind spending a little bit more to support the things that you believe in, but on some things, like pasta, it\u2019s prohibitive.\u201d A major advantage to Loop\u2019s business model, Szaky says, is that it forces packaging designers to prioritise durability over disposability. In future, Szaky anticipates that Loop will be able to email users warnings for expiry dates and other advice to reduce their waste footprint. The milkman model is about more than just the bottle: it makes us think about what we consume and what we throw away. \u201cGarbage is something that we want out of sight and mind \u2013 it\u2019s dirty, it\u2019s gross, it smells bad,\u201d says Szaky. That is what needs to change. It is tempting to see plastic piled up in Malaysian landfills and assume recycling is a waste of time, but that isn\u2019t true. In the UK, recycling is largely a success story, and the alternatives \u2013 burning our waste or burying it \u2013 are worse. Instead of giving up on recycling, Szaky says, we should all use less, re-use what we can and treat our waste like the waste industry sees it: as a resource. Not the ending of something, but the beginning of something else. \u201cWe don\u2019t call it waste; we call it materials,\u201d says Green Recycling\u2019s Smith, back in Maldon. Down in the yard, a haulage truck is being loaded with 35 bales of sorted cardboard. From here, Smith will send it to a mill in Kent for pulping. It will be new cardboard boxes within the fortnight \u2013 and someone else\u2019s rubbish soon after. \u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

      "body": "<p>Who can tire of the sight of two world-class musicians, friends since childhood in Buenos Aires, parading round the Royal Albert Hall stage in their own victory lap, he holding up her hand as if leading her to the tango floor, protective, encouraging, she looking bemused but safe and gracious. This (<strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0007jzb\" title=\"\">Prom 34</a></strong>) was the year\u2019s hottest ticket: two septuagenarians who each made their Proms debuts, in separate concerts, in 1966. The pianist Martha Argerich and the conductor Daniel Barenboim, also pianist, peace ambassador and musical polymath, were taking bows after a wild, almost feral performance of Tchaikovsky\u2019s Piano Concerto No 1 in B flat minor. The orchestra was the <a href=\"https://www.west-eastern-divan.org/\" title=\"\">West-Eastern Divan</a>, which Barenboim founded, with the author Edward Said, two decades ago.</p> <p>Argerich has acquired near mythical status, chiefly for her phenomenal playing \u2013 still brilliant and technically assured \u2013 in part because she is rarely seen here. Her last Prom, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku9xmCpRShs\" title=\"\">three years ago</a>, was with the same forces. (She and Barenboim ended up playing a Schubert piano duet, an encore not repeated last week alas.) Argerich has a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItSJ_woWnmk\" title=\"\">long association with the Tchaikovsky</a>, one of the most popular concertos in the romantic warhorse repertoire. With ferocious opening chords, she led the tempo as if daring the orchestra to stay with her, which they did, mostly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4a82fc415b193d5c7e505650b95bb2989c688b5c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a82fc415b193d5c7e505650b95bb2989c688b5c/0_0_1920_1280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Martha Argerich performs Tchaikovsky\u2019s Piano Concerto No 1 at Prom 34.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Still brilliant\u2019\u2026 Martha Argerich performs Tchaikovsky\u2019s Piano Concerto No 1 at Prom 34.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Christodoulou/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Barenboim knows her playing so well he barely needed to look at her, adjusting his beat accordingly, ushering the orchestra into orderly action out of the miasma and fantasy of her solo passages. It must have been hair-raising for the players, and there were moments of slippage, but the work held us gripped. Together with a slightly unsettled account of Schubert\u2019s \u201cUnfinished\u201d Symphony No 8, the other major piece was Witold Lutos\u0142awski\u2019s Concerto for Orchestra (1950-54), a richly coloured masterpiece by a composer who, a quarter of a century after his death, deserves fresh attention. With its rip-roaring brass chorales, thunderous timpani and flickering string writing, it showed the Divan at its best.</p> <p>The other highlight of the week \u2013 of the season, too \u2013 was a Prom (<strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0007k4y\" title=\"\">32</a></strong>) on a Sunday morning by musicians in their teens: the 16- to 19-year-olds of the <a href=\"https://www.carnegiehall.org/Education/Young-Musicians/NYO-USA\" title=\"\">National Youth Orchestra of the USA</a>, conducted by Antonio Pappano, with the mezzo-soprano <a href=\"https://joycedidonato.com/\" title=\"\">Joyce DiDonato </a>as soloist. (They had also performed together at Edinburgh\u2019s Usher Hall, two days earlier.) DiDonato could have stolen the show in her gloriously shaded, sensuous performance of Berlioz\u2019s <em>Les nuits d\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9</em> but was determined not to, giving no encore and generously air-punching and applauding her talented young compatriots. A boisterous, minimalist-inspired curtain-raiser, Occidentalis, by <a href=\"https://www.benjaminbeckmanmusic.com/\" title=\"\">Benjamin Beckman</a>, showed that even at 19 you can have a strong compositional voice.</p> <p>The main work was Richard Strauss\u2019s <em>An Alpine Symphony</em>, which depicts a mountain climb of epic extravagance requiring massive forces (some 120 players on stage). Pappano responded to the NYO-USA\u2019s youthful exuberance \u2013 reinforced with brass from the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain in the gallery \u2013 by urging them up to the summit in record speed, with no loss of detail or nuance. This symphony, with its endless peaks, can prompt the \u201care we there yet?\u201d query.

His chorus from English National Opera, where he is music director, joined the BBC Singers for Brahms\u2019s <em>Song of Destiny</em> and Vaughan Williams\u2019s <em>Serenade to Music</em>, each work melancholy and consoling in their different ways.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/aug/18/scriabin-chen-yunjie-accentus-review-mariam-batsashvili-chopin-liszt-warner-edinburgh-radio-3\">Home listening: Scriabin, Chopin and Liszt piano works</a> </p> </aside>  <p>No war is good, even when waged between teenagers brandishing lacrosse sticks on one side, hockey sticks on the other, lethal weapons both.

      "bodyText": "Who can tire of the sight of two world-class musicians, friends since childhood in Buenos Aires, parading round the Royal Albert Hall stage in their own victory lap, he holding up her hand as if leading her to the tango floor, protective, encouraging, she looking bemused but safe and gracious. This (Prom 34) was the year\u2019s hottest ticket: two septuagenarians who each made their Proms debuts, in separate concerts, in 1966. The pianist Martha Argerich and the conductor Daniel Barenboim, also pianist, peace ambassador and musical polymath, were taking bows after a wild, almost feral performance of Tchaikovsky\u2019s Piano Concerto No 1 in B flat minor. The orchestra was the West-Eastern Divan, which Barenboim founded, with the author Edward Said, two decades ago. Argerich has acquired near mythical status, chiefly for her phenomenal playing \u2013 still brilliant and technically assured \u2013 in part because she is rarely seen here. Her last Prom, three years ago, was with the same forces. (She and Barenboim ended up playing a Schubert piano duet, an encore not repeated last week alas.) Argerich has a long association with the Tchaikovsky, one of the most popular concertos in the romantic warhorse repertoire. With ferocious opening chords, she led the tempo as if daring the orchestra to stay with her, which they did, mostly. Barenboim knows her playing so well he barely needed to look at her, adjusting his beat accordingly, ushering the orchestra into orderly action out of the miasma and fantasy of her solo passages. It must have been hair-raising for the players, and there were moments of slippage, but the work held us gripped. Together with a slightly unsettled account of Schubert\u2019s \u201cUnfinished\u201d Symphony No 8, the other major piece was Witold Lutos\u0142awski\u2019s Concerto for Orchestra (1950-54), a richly coloured masterpiece by a composer who, a quarter of a century after his death, deserves fresh attention. With its rip-roaring brass chorales, thunderous timpani and flickering string writing, it showed the Divan at its best. The other highlight of the week \u2013 of the season, too \u2013 was a Prom (32) on a Sunday morning by musicians in their teens: the 16- to 19-year-olds of the National Youth Orchestra of the USA, conducted by Antonio Pappano, with the mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato as soloist. (They had also performed together at Edinburgh\u2019s Usher Hall, two days earlier.) DiDonato could have stolen the show in her gloriously shaded, sensuous performance of Berlioz\u2019s Les nuits d\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 but was determined not to, giving no encore and generously air-punching and applauding her talented young compatriots. A boisterous, minimalist-inspired curtain-raiser, Occidentalis, by Benjamin Beckman, showed that even at 19 you can have a strong compositional voice. The main work was Richard Strauss\u2019s An Alpine Symphony, which depicts a mountain climb of epic extravagance requiring massive forces (some 120 players on stage). Pappano responded to the NYO-USA\u2019s youthful exuberance \u2013 reinforced with brass from the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain in the gallery \u2013 by urging them up to the summit in record speed, with no loss of detail or nuance. This symphony, with its endless peaks, can prompt the \u201care we there yet?\u201d query. Here, instead, it was more an enthusiastic exclamation: \u201cThere so soon!\u201d Their encore was \u201cNimrod\u201d, heard again in context two days later in Elgar\u2019s Enigma Variations, part of the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra\u2019s Prom 35. The conductor was Martyn Brabbins, who has served contemporary music \u2013 not only, but especially, British \u2013 with conviction and imagination all his career. For his 60th birthday last Tuesday, 14 composers had contributed to a new set of variations using Elgar\u2019s example as the framework. Pictured Within: Birthday Variations for M.C.B. worked unexpectedly well as an entity. It also captures, in one work, some of the contrasting voices, from romantic to witty to downright noisy, currently writing for symphonic forces. Each composer \u2013 including Sally Beamish, Judith Weir, Harrison Birtwistle, Colin Matthews, Brett Dean and David Sawer \u2013 honoured Brabbins with carefully crafted, distinctive offerings. His chorus from English National Opera, where he is music director, joined the BBC Singers for Brahms\u2019s Song of Destiny and Vaughan Williams\u2019s Serenade to Music, each work melancholy and consoling in their different ways. No war is good, even when waged between teenagers brandishing lacrosse sticks on one side, hockey sticks on the other, lethal weapons both. Robert Carsen\u2019s production of Handel\u2019s Rinaldo, new at Glyndebourne in 2011, sidesteps the thorny First Crusade setting and has the action occur in a dream-cum-school history lesson. It\u2019s cleverly designed (by Gideon Davey), with witty routines in the playground, on old black bicycles or in many-bedded dormitories. Braided blazers, or gymslips and plaits, are standard, unless you happen to be the stiletto-heeled sorceress Armida (Kristina Mkhitaryan), in which case shrink-wrapped black latex is obligatory. This revival, by Bruno Ravella, is slickly done. The show is played for laughs, especially in the near-farcical last act. You can take or leave the staging, a concept with a capital K, but it\u2019s one way to negotiate the heroes/villains, Christians/Saracens plot, which nevertheless turns out happily. High musical standards make this a revival to relish. The title role was sung by the rising-star Polish countertenor Jakub J\u00f3zef Orli\u0144ski, stepping in at short notice for Elizabeth DeShong. In his short career to date, Orli\u0144ski has sung Rinaldo at Frankfurt, but this was his Glyndebourne debut. The New Yorker magazine recently called him a millennial countertenor with pop-star appeal who \u201cbrings a swooning sultriness \u2013 and a bunch of break-dancing moves \u2013 to the baroque music revival\u201d.

Demonstrators blocked passengers, forcing a shutdown, as well as clashing with police and detaining two men suspected of being spies in scenes pro-government figures and Chinese state media have seized on as evidence of the protesters\u2019 violent tendencies. Following the violent episodes, protesters have called for a weekend of peaceful marches and a return to the methods used when the demonstrations began in June. On Saturday, the rallies were mostly peaceful as demonstrators appeared focused on Sunday\u2019s demonstration in Hong Kong\u2019s Victoria Park. Marching in Kowloon, they yelled: \u201cSee you at Victoria Park!\u201d Many wore surgical masks but did not appear to be in full protective gear as they had been in past rallies in preparation for confrontations with the police. Riot police were deployed to meet dozens of protesters who had splintered off from the designated route of a march in Hung Hom in Kowloon and occupied roads, but skirmishes were limited. One group surrounded a police station in Mong Kok and threw eggs at the building until riot police charged at the group, dispersing them. Others vandalised the offices of a pro-Beijing political party. One group left pineapples, meant to symbolise grenades, at the door of a pro-government organisation, the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions, which played a key role in anti-colonial government riots in 1967, when homemade bombs were planted at street corners around the city. Critics said officials seemed intent on clashing with protesters. The police have banned the original plan for Sunday\u2019s event, a march, and have instead confined it to a rally within Victoria Park. The park can hold about 100,000 people but organisers expect many more. Rally-goers on nearby roads or other overflow areas can be charged with unlawful assembly, which can lead to a maximum of five years in prison. \u201cWe know the government is not trying to help the situation or at least not showing any signs of trying,\u201d said Elizabeth Yu, 26, a musician and performer. Government supporters were also holding a rival \u201canti-violence\u201d demonstration outside the government headquarters. Participants dressed in white, to show their contrast with the protesters, sang the national anthem and chanted: \u201cOppose violence! Save Hong Kong!\u201d As the protests enter their third month, there has been no sign of concessions from the government, and Beijing has issued increasingly severe warnings. Analysts said authorities were hoping the protests would diminish on their own after students return to school in September. But on Friday secondary school students pledged to boycott classes one day a week when term begins, and university students are expected to launch similar campaigns. Nonetheless, observers suggested it is likely that the momentum of protests will decrease.. \u201cEven if the movement gradually dies down from this point on it has long-lasting impacts. Many people gained a kind of political consciousness. This is not something you can erase instantaneously,\u201d said Wong, an academic focusing on social movements in Hong Kong, who prefers not to give his full name. \u201cProbably you won\u2019t see the same frequency and intensity but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s over. Because once people have been woken up, they can\u2019t be put back to sleep,\u201d he said.",

      "body": "<p>Suketu Mehta is tucking into a vegetarian lunch in one of his favourite Thai restaurants in New York\u2019s Jackson Heights district and looking back in \u2013 and on \u2013 the anger of 2017. His anger was the result of journalistic assignments to Hungary where he witnessed<strong> </strong>politically choreographed rage against north African refugees crossing the border from Serbia. Back in America, itself dinning with nationalistic bloviation, his Foreign Policy magazine article on what he now calls \u201cthe whole staggering hypocrisy of the global debate around migration\u201d resulted in hundreds of threatening tweets and emails. \u201cEssentially what I said was that people are coming to rich countries from poor countries not because they want to, but because rich countries had stolen the futures of poor countries.\u201d</p> <p>Mehta himself is an immigrant. Born in Calcutta in 1963, he moved with his Gujarati parents to Jackson Heights in 1977. \u201cFourteen is a strange age at which to shift countries, because you never finished growing up in one and you never fully wear the skin in the one you move to,\u201d he reflects. He attended a Catholic school where \u201cI was kicked out of the speech and debate team because of my accent.\u201d He was beaten up more than once. Yet this predominantly working-class area, rich in teeming, noisy sidewalks, is still close to his heart.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m always shocked by the lack of historical awareness of the average American. Many people who have come here did so to forget history</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Mehta leads me through Jackson Heights \u2013 bot\u00e1nicas selling spiritual and occult fare, illegal basement residences, strip clubs, a street sign honouring Alfred Butts, the local who devised Scrabble in 1931. Like that board game, Mehta is intrigued by fashioning sense from what initially seems like nonsense. His first and widely heralded book <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/feb/06/travel.features\" title=\"\">Maximum City</a></em>, a 2005 Pulitzer finalist, was a collagist portrait of Mumbai, a place often characterised by cultural tourists as unlivable and chaotic. At more than 600 pages long it was vivid, multi-accented, brimming with tales of hitmen, sex workers and crooked politicians. The novelist Amit Chaudhuri praised it for its \u201cgiant embrace not only of a city but of hope \u2013 and its more complex, early incarnation, desire \u2013 in the age of the free market\u201d. Rather than being an earnest sociology of a \u201cThird World megalopolis\u201d or focusing solely on structural problems, it evoked possibilities. Its enduring value lay in the extent to which it made it difficult for writers to dismiss cities in reductive language, using terms such as slums, ghettoes and favelas.</p> <p><em>This Land Is Our Land: An Immigrant\u2019s Manifesto</em>, published this month in the UK, is a different kind of book that toggles between journalistic dispatch, memoir, postcolonial critique and vigorous polemic of the existential guile and social vitality that immigrants possess. It\u2019s also animated by a rage at what he believes is the hypocrisy of the west, sardonically drawing attention in its opening pages to the way in which \u201cthey fouled the air above us and the waters around us, making our farms barren, our oceans lifeless; and they were aghast when the poorest among us arrived at their borders, not to steal but to work, to clean their shit, and to fuck their men\u201d.</p> <p>Mehta holds American citizenship and is an associate professor of journalism at New York University. Who are \u201cthey\u201d I ask. \u201cI am a migrant, but I\u2019m also an American. My taxes financed an illegal and incredibly bloody war that plunged the whole of the Middle East into turmoil. I\u2019m the recipient of an economy that is fouling the atmosphere. So I\u2019m certainly enjoying my privilege here and deeply implicated in all of this. Yet I\u2019m always shocked by the lack of historical awareness on the part of the average American. Many of the people who have come here did so to forget history, to turn their backs on history.\u201d</p> <p>Mehta\u2019s parents expected him to go into the diamond business and were less than happy when he decided to become a journalist. \u201cThey had an immigrant fear that I wouldn\u2019t be able to support my family. And for a long time I didn\u2019t. I wrote for technical magazines. I lived in the East Village and had to pay the rent with credit cards. I lived in a Brooklyn studio rife with bed bugs.\u201d</p> <p>A formative experience was an assignment for the Village Voice on the 1984 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/01/bhopal-chemical-studies-toxic-levels\" title=\"\">Union Carbide </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/01/bhopal-chemical-studies-toxic-levels\" title=\"\">gas </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/01/bhopal-chemical-studies-toxic-levels\" title=\"\">disaster in Bhopal</a>. \u201cI saw the way a multinational could go into India, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/07/bhopal-disaster-india-sentences\" title=\"\">cut safety mechanisms</a> at the plant to save money, and then, when the plant blew up killing tens of thousands of people \u2013 I met people who had lost their entire families that night \u2013 it paid token compensation, $200. And because it\u2019s a multinational it just severs a limb, shuts down Union Carbide India, and then grows another limb somewhere else.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was standing at\u00a0the border with my reporter\u2019s notebook, trying\u00a0to harvest\u00a0stories, and I broke down\u00a0weeping</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Mehta sees the extractive practices of contemporary capitalism as a form of neo-colonialism. \u201cThe biggest reason for mass migration is the astonishingly obtuse mapmaking of the colonial powers. Just two countries \u2013 Britain and France \u2013 made 40% of the colonial borders. When Britain left India after two centuries of rule they brought in a gormless barrister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/aug/17/thepartitiondelusion\" title=\"\">Cyril Radcliffe</a>, who\u2019d never been to India, and gave him six weeks to draw two lines down a map, which now form the dividing lines between 1.6 billion people and have ensured permanent conflict between the two countries.\u201d</p> <p>One of the most memorable scenes in <em>This Land Is Our Land</em> comes early on when Mehta visits a tiny stretch of ground known as Friendship Park. Lying between San Diego and Tijuana, it is the only place along the 2,000-mile US-Mexican border where families can meet \u2013 albeit across a wire fence. If a child wanted to touch her mother, Mehta writes, \u201cshe could stick her pinky inside the fence, and her mother could do the same on the opposite side, and the tips of their pinkies could touch: the dance of the fingers, the \u2018pinky kiss\u2019\u201d.</p> <p>It is a beautiful, terrible detail that cuts through all slogans and pieties to isolate the cruelty of modern-day partition. \u201cI broke down weeping at Friendship Park,\u201d Mehta recalls. \u201cI was standing there with my reporter\u2019s notebook trying to harvest stories. This man, this taciturn Mexican who hadn\u2019t seen his mother for 17 years, rode up to the fence. And then mama comes along. And \u2026 he can\u2019t hug her. I mean, what do you say? She asks if he\u2019s eating right. Of course he breaks down \u2026</p> <p>Mehta also remembers a brother and sister meeting their parents there. \u201cThey blamed their parents for abandoning them and moving back to Mexico. They hadn\u2019t seen their parents for 11 years and they said to me, \u2018We fight but \u2026 this is love \u2026 This is what we\u2019ve been missing.\u2019 I ran to my car and I was weeping and I called my parents in New Jersey and told them how much I loved them. They don\u2019t get these kinds of calls from me.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9bc7e7c82d60118048518699107dfdef1455b859\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9bc7e7c82d60118048518699107dfdef1455b859/0_0_5183_3455/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People at the US-Mexico border fence at Friendship Park in Playas de Tijuana, Baja California\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Touching moments \u2026 US-Mexico border fence at Friendship Park in Playas de Tijuana, Baja California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Xinhua/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe talk about family values. In Friendship Park you see people trying to touch each other in the most basic of ways. The need of the human body for touch. And \u2026 they\u2019re not allowed to hug because some horrible bureaucrat has decided that hugging might be a national security threat.

I think the South Asians in the country were much more ghetto-ised. They weren\u2019t even pretending to be British. They had a very strong identification with London but not with being British. Whereas most of the people in this restaurant can aspire to American-ness.\u201d</p> <p>Would he urge 14-year-olds growing up in modern-day Gujarat to migrate to the US? \u201cNo. The 20th century used to be the American century. The 21st century not so much. There are going to be more and more Americans moving out. There are already 9 million non-military Americans living outside the US. The biggest factor is healthcare: every time I go to Europe I meet expats who say: \u2018We don\u2019t have to worry about getting sick here.\u2019 It\u2019s really interesting to hear Americans in Europe or in India grouse about the immigration system and having to stand in line to get their visas renewed.

      "bodyText": "Suketu Mehta is tucking into a vegetarian lunch in one of his favourite Thai restaurants in New York\u2019s Jackson Heights district and looking back in \u2013 and on \u2013 the anger of 2017. His anger was the result of journalistic assignments to Hungary where he witnessed politically choreographed rage against north African refugees crossing the border from Serbia. Back in America, itself dinning with nationalistic bloviation, his Foreign Policy magazine article on what he now calls \u201cthe whole staggering hypocrisy of the global debate around migration\u201d resulted in hundreds of threatening tweets and emails. \u201cEssentially what I said was that people are coming to rich countries from poor countries not because they want to, but because rich countries had stolen the futures of poor countries.\u201d Mehta himself is an immigrant. Born in Calcutta in 1963, he moved with his Gujarati parents to Jackson Heights in 1977. \u201cFourteen is a strange age at which to shift countries, because you never finished growing up in one and you never fully wear the skin in the one you move to,\u201d he reflects. He attended a Catholic school where \u201cI was kicked out of the speech and debate team because of my accent.\u201d He was beaten up more than once. Yet this predominantly working-class area, rich in teeming, noisy sidewalks, is still close to his heart. Mehta leads me through Jackson Heights \u2013 bot\u00e1nicas selling spiritual and occult fare, illegal basement residences, strip clubs, a street sign honouring Alfred Butts, the local who devised Scrabble in 1931. Like that board game, Mehta is intrigued by fashioning sense from what initially seems like nonsense. His first and widely heralded book Maximum City, a 2005 Pulitzer finalist, was a collagist portrait of Mumbai, a place often characterised by cultural tourists as unlivable and chaotic. At more than 600 pages long it was vivid, multi-accented, brimming with tales of hitmen, sex workers and crooked politicians. The novelist Amit Chaudhuri praised it for its \u201cgiant embrace not only of a city but of hope \u2013 and its more complex, early incarnation, desire \u2013 in the age of the free market\u201d. Rather than being an earnest sociology of a \u201cThird World megalopolis\u201d or focusing solely on structural problems, it evoked possibilities. Its enduring value lay in the extent to which it made it difficult for writers to dismiss cities in reductive language, using terms such as slums, ghettoes and favelas. This Land Is Our Land: An Immigrant\u2019s Manifesto, published this month in the UK, is a different kind of book that toggles between journalistic dispatch, memoir, postcolonial critique and vigorous polemic of the existential guile and social vitality that immigrants possess. It\u2019s also animated by a rage at what he believes is the hypocrisy of the west, sardonically drawing attention in its opening pages to the way in which \u201cthey fouled the air above us and the waters around us, making our farms barren, our oceans lifeless; and they were aghast when the poorest among us arrived at their borders, not to steal but to work, to clean their shit, and to fuck their men\u201d. Mehta holds American citizenship and is an associate professor of journalism at New York University. Who are \u201cthey\u201d I ask. \u201cI am a migrant, but I\u2019m also an American. My taxes financed an illegal and incredibly bloody war that plunged the whole of the Middle East into turmoil. I\u2019m the recipient of an economy that is fouling the atmosphere. So I\u2019m certainly enjoying my privilege here and deeply implicated in all of this. Yet I\u2019m always shocked by the lack of historical awareness on the part of the average American. Many of the people who have come here did so to forget history, to turn their backs on history.\u201d Mehta\u2019s parents expected him to go into the diamond business and were less than happy when he decided to become a journalist. \u201cThey had an immigrant fear that I wouldn\u2019t be able to support my family. And for a long time I didn\u2019t. I wrote for technical magazines. I lived in the East Village and had to pay the rent with credit cards. I lived in a Brooklyn studio rife with bed bugs.\u201d A formative experience was an assignment for the Village Voice on the 1984 Union Carbide gas disaster in Bhopal. \u201cI saw the way a multinational could go into India, cut safety mechanisms at the plant to save money, and then, when the plant blew up killing tens of thousands of people \u2013 I met people who had lost their entire families that night \u2013 it paid token compensation, $200. And because it\u2019s a multinational it just severs a limb, shuts down Union Carbide India, and then grows another limb somewhere else.\u201d Mehta sees the extractive practices of contemporary capitalism as a form of neo-colonialism. \u201cThe biggest reason for mass migration is the astonishingly obtuse mapmaking of the colonial powers. Just two countries \u2013 Britain and France \u2013 made 40% of the colonial borders. When Britain left India after two centuries of rule they brought in a gormless barrister, Cyril Radcliffe, who\u2019d never been to India, and gave him six weeks to draw two lines down a map, which now form the dividing lines between 1.6 billion people and have ensured permanent conflict between the two countries.\u201d One of the most memorable scenes in This Land Is Our Land comes early on when Mehta visits a tiny stretch of ground known as Friendship Park. Lying between San Diego and Tijuana, it is the only place along the 2,000-mile US-Mexican border where families can meet \u2013 albeit across a wire fence. If a child wanted to touch her mother, Mehta writes, \u201cshe could stick her pinky inside the fence, and her mother could do the same on the opposite side, and the tips of their pinkies could touch: the dance of the fingers, the \u2018pinky kiss\u2019\u201d. It is a beautiful, terrible detail that cuts through all slogans and pieties to isolate the cruelty of modern-day partition. \u201cI broke down weeping at Friendship Park,\u201d Mehta recalls. \u201cI was standing there with my reporter\u2019s notebook trying to harvest stories. This man, this taciturn Mexican who hadn\u2019t seen his mother for 17 years, rode up to the fence. And then mama comes along. And \u2026 he can\u2019t hug her. I mean, what do you say? She asks if he\u2019s eating right. Of course he breaks down \u2026 Mehta also remembers a brother and sister meeting their parents there. \u201cThey blamed their parents for abandoning them and moving back to Mexico. They hadn\u2019t seen their parents for 11 years and they said to me, \u2018We fight but \u2026 this is love \u2026 This is what we\u2019ve been missing.\u2019 I ran to my car and I was weeping and I called my parents in New Jersey and told them how much I loved them. They don\u2019t get these kinds of calls from me. \u201cWe talk about family values. In Friendship Park you see people trying to touch each other in the most basic of ways. The need of the human body for touch. And \u2026 they\u2019re not allowed to hug because some horrible bureaucrat has decided that hugging might be a national security threat. The border patrol chief there told me that God evicted Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden and built a wall around it \u2026\u201d Though he\u2019s most closely associated with Mumbai (a place he still thinks of as Bombay), Mehta has spent stretches of his life in other cities, among them Paris, S\u00e3o Paulo and London. \u201cI remember walking down a shopping street in Milford [in Surrey] and a group of white yobs yelling out \u2018Paki\u2019.

In the penumbra cast in this shadowy world, plants that thrive have had to adapt to just glimmers of light \u2013 deep shade is defined as having less than two hours of sunlight a day. The leaves of shade-loving plants often have a deep-green colour, and tend to be thinner and broader than their sun-loving cousins. This is because they have adapted to absorb the filtered light under the forest canopy. They are also usually shinier, to reflect light into the margins and corners of their world. It takes a lot of energy to grow in such poor light conditions, and a greater allocation of energy goes into defence mechanisms against hungry herbivores. These plants have camouflaged, often mottled leaves and inconspicuous flowers and fruit compared with sun worshippers. If you crave flowers, white violas, lily of the valley, and the more tasteful white begonias can be bought cheaply and used as temporary bedding plants. They will eventually grow leggy, at which point take cuttings, and compost. What you don\u2019t get in floral power you can make up for in leaf size, shape and texture. Glossy, sometimes surprisingly lush and tropical greens that, if built up in layers, make for a deeply restorative space.

Sowing in June will mean the plant goes straight to flowering in the heat; but if you sow now, when temperatures are still warm enough for quick germination, it will ensure more leaf than flower, particularly with autumn\u2019s long, cooler nights around the corner. If you have planted your cress outside, and want to keep it going over winter, you will need some sort of shelter, a cloche or fleece, as frost will take it down. At this point you could move the operation indoors. I\u2019ve fallen for the folded edges of Wrinkled Crinkled Crumpled from the Real Seed Catalogue \u2013 it\u2019s a cross between curly cress and Persian cress. The latter you can get from Chiltern Seeds and is decidedly less peppery. If you want heat, go for Greek cress (seedaholic.com), which is less crumpled, perhaps slightly nuttier in flavour, and definitely packs a punch.",

The rumours of the All Blacks\u2019 demise were greatly overstated - and while it wasn\u2019t the best showing from a slightly sub-par Wallabies, it was a huge statement of pre-World Cup intent, that the World number one team is in no mood to meekly lay down their crown, just yet.</p> <p>Hugely improved in the scrum, dangerous as always on the counter attack, and hunting in packs at the breakdown - this was as ruthless an 80-minute performance as you\u2019ll see.</p> <p>Still, a few missed lineout, a few missed conversions - Steve Hansen and his staff will maintain that it wasn\u2019t a perfect performance. Had Beauden Barrett slotted his 78th minute attempt (or Richie Mo\u2019unga banged home a pre-half-time penalty for that matter) it could have been a record margin of defeat between New Zealand and Australia. A small mercy, perhaps. Despite some poor handling, that would be a harsh indictment on a Wallabies side that for 10-15 minutes in the first half looked good value to level the All Blacks\u2019 early lead.</p> <p>Two key penalty misses from Lealiifano would have hurt Australian morale, before a rapid-fire two-try salvo from the All Blacks effectively ended the contest early on. You can\u2019t miss your chances at this level.</p> <p>Still, it was the determination with which New Zealand defended their own line which was especially noticeable. Plenty has been written over the past week (and in recent months) and this squad of 23 was too proud to take any of that, lying down. Even late in the 70th-80th minute there was no space for charity.</p> <p>Big, strong - and a little bit angry. The imperious All Blacks are back, Ladies and Gentlemen. And the Bledisloe Cup stranglehold continues.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d57cbc88f084f687f3582c7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-17T09:42:39.020Z\">10.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Tom Callaghan has written in:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Wobblies were world champions elect last week!</p> <p>Wobblies wobbling \u2019again, eh?</p> <p>Wasn\u2019t it a French bloke who said - I can\u2019t do the accent - <em>plus \u00e7a change, plus c\u2019est la meme chose?</em></p> </blockquote> <p>I think you\u2019re right, Tom.

Sonny Bill Williams returns for the injured Jack Goodhue, and Scott Barrett\u2019s suspension sees Patrick Tuipulotu come into the back row.

Like something akin to a George Orwell novel, Eden Park has become a dystopian wasteland for Australian rugby, with Australia failing to record a win there in the past 18 attempts.</p> <p>One of the fabled stadia of world sport, if the Wallabies are to end a 16-year Bledisloe hoodoo, it will have to be in spectacular fashion - at the very heart of enemy territory.</p> <p>The All Blacks will be chastened, smarting even, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/aug/10/wallabies-v-all-blacks-bledisloe-cup-rugby-championship-2019-live\">after last Saturday\u2019s record 47-26 loss in Perth</a>. It\u2019s one thing to catch a premier team, reduced to 14 men, on the hop - it\u2019s another thing entirely to beat a full complement of 15, that well and truly know you\u2019re coming.</p> <p>Still, the All Blacks have shown some uncharacteristic errors creeping into their game, and confidence will be high in the Wallabies dressing room after one of their best performances, especially in recent memory.</p> <p>So get excited for this one.

      "bodyText": "If you\u2019re just waking up in the Northern Hemisphere, be afraid - Wales, England and Ireland fans. The rumours of the All Blacks\u2019 demise were greatly overstated - and while it wasn\u2019t the best showing from a slightly sub-par Wallabies, it was a huge statement of pre-World Cup intent, that the World number one team is in no mood to meekly lay down their crown, just yet. Hugely improved in the scrum, dangerous as always on the counter attack, and hunting in packs at the breakdown - this was as ruthless an 80-minute performance as you\u2019ll see. Still, a few missed lineout, a few missed conversions - Steve Hansen and his staff will maintain that it wasn\u2019t a perfect performance. Had Beauden Barrett slotted his 78th minute attempt (or Richie Mo\u2019unga banged home a pre-half-time penalty for that matter) it could have been a record margin of defeat between New Zealand and Australia. A small mercy, perhaps. Despite some poor handling, that would be a harsh indictment on a Wallabies side that for 10-15 minutes in the first half looked good value to level the All Blacks\u2019 early lead. Two key penalty misses from Lealiifano would have hurt Australian morale, before a rapid-fire two-try salvo from the All Blacks effectively ended the contest early on. You can\u2019t miss your chances at this level. Still, it was the determination with which New Zealand defended their own line which was especially noticeable. Plenty has been written over the past week (and in recent months) and this squad of 23 was too proud to take any of that, lying down. Even late in the 70th-80th minute there was no space for charity. Big, strong - and a little bit angry. The imperious All Blacks are back, Ladies and Gentlemen. And the Bledisloe Cup stranglehold continues. Tom Callaghan has written in: Wobblies were world champions elect last week! Wobblies wobbling \u2019again, eh? Wasn\u2019t it a French bloke who said - I can\u2019t do the accent - plus \u00e7a change, plus c\u2019est la meme chose? I think you\u2019re right, Tom. Them Wobblies will wobble. Not too many have left the stadium, as Kieran Read strides forward to receive a 17th consecutive Bledisloe Cup on behalf of the All Blacks. A handshake from NZ Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern. Is she the only politician in world sport not to get booed? Or is that just an Australian tradition. Kieran Read holds it aloft - Old Jug Ears - and the crowd roar their approval. My, oh my. So - what happens when you poke a bear? A 57-point turnaround is what. Your final thoughts on that showing? All Blacks fans - who was your best on ground - and where did the team most improve from the Testus Horribilis last weekend in Perth? They chance their arm one last time after the whistle, but ALB takes pity and boots into touch. They\u2019ve seen enough, the Wallabies, and who can blame them. It brings a huge cheer from the home fans - they\u2019re very happy with what they\u2019ve seen, on a cold, wet night in Auckland. It\u2019s a ruthless, emphatic and in retrospect, entirely predicted response from the All Blacks. They retain the Bledisloe Cup for a 17th straight year! 77 min: Eep. They\u2019re in again, and that was terrific stuff from New Zealand. ALB (as they call him) with the impetus from outside centre (now that SBW is off the pitch) - and it\u2019s the other winger on debut - George Bridge who muscles over for a well-deserved try. Beauden Barrett with the conversion attempt, but he hits it just to the right. Don has written in suggesting a possible subplot to this Wallabies performance: Wallabies have done the right thing ensuring England do not get No 1 ranking - a true Southern Hemisphere team. Hahaha. It\u2019s a silver lining for Wallabies fans, perhaps. 74 min: Just under 50,000 in in Eden Park - and the vast majority of them are going to go away very, very happy tonight. They\u2019ve been dominant in almost every category, the All Blacks. Lienert-Brown with another line break, but the Wallabies knock the attempted offload to ground. Danger averted - for now. 72 min: Ooph! That\u2019s a massive hit. Hodge has been sandbagged - Kieran Read has nailed him! The skipper said post-match they weren\u2019t good enough in Perth and would need to improve. His game was pretty good in Australia, but if possible he\u2019s lifted again. Leading by example - terrific stuff. 70 min: Eep. They\u2019re away again, New Zealand! But referee Peyper peeps Lienert-Brown back. It was a flying intercept from the outside centre, but there was a marginal knock-on from the ABs in the build-up from the restart. Australian fans collective say \u201cphew\u201d. 67 min: Wowee, wow! It\u2019s a first ever try in All Black colours, and it\u2019s Harlem Globetrotters stuff from the winger! It\u2019s a first-time volley forward to a bouncing ball - he motors around his opposite number and wins the footrace, to ground his own kick in-goal. Perfect weight, perfect skill and blistering pace! Wingers all around the world will have watched that and shuddered, pre World Cup. You\u2019re. On. Notice. And a change of goalkicker with Mo\u2019unga off. It\u2019s Jordie Barrett who steps up, and he\u2019s slotted that from the sideline. Tidy. 65 min: They win the line out, Australia but they can\u2019t get a drive going. They switch right, but there\u2019s a turnover! Hodge isolated, and it\u2019s a wall of Black that gets there first. Too quick, too strong. They celebrate, the ABs - do you think they\u2019re up for it tonight? 63 min: Terrific set piece from the Wallabies, as Koroibete joins the bacline from the opposite wing. Terrific hands, and a well-worked play. Very unlucky not to burst the line, but credit the All Blacks defence. That was beautiful to watch. They win another penalty though, and kick for the line. Can they make something from this? Line out about 15m out from the All Blacks line. 62 min: They build the phases, the ABs, but it\u2019s turned over. Genia looks to kick away - but it\u2019s charged down by Jordie Barrett! Fortuitously, that goes to a player in gold - what a sucker punch that could have been! They clear their lines, Australia. Grant Marjoribanks writes in on the performance of Nic White: For Nic White, the hero in Bledisloe 1 in 2015, thumped the following week. A hero in Bledisloe 1 in 2019, subbed the following week. A sense of de ja vu? It\u2019s a good point. They look to have done their homework on the Australian No9 this week, the All Blacks. One or two busts aside he had nowhere near the influence he did in Perth (admittedly, with plenty more ball in hand). 59 min: So a shuffle for NZ - Jordie Barrett comes on to slot in at fullback, and brother Beauden shifts to No 10. Lets hope that\u2019s not serious for Richie Mo\u2019unga - he\u2019s been immense tonight. Skipper Kieran Read with a big tackle and turnover. Some criticism coming his way in recent months, but that was terrific work - especially 60 minutes in. What strength! 58 min: They\u2019re hunting in packs again out wide, the All Blacks. Sonny Bill has \u201ca look\u201d in his eyes, Lienert-Brown is in the mood too. Terrific hands from Reece - almost razzle-dazzle stuff from the ABs - but Jaco Peyper has the whistle in mouth. Forward pass! Lienert-Brown knows it too. Concern now for Mo\u2019unga, who has remained down with a shoulder injury. Uhoh. New Zealand don\u2019t need this with a World Cup just around the corner. 56 min: It\u2019s 9-4 in the handling errors column, and that\u2019s hurting the Wallabies a lot. Is it the greasy conditions? Is it additional pressure from the All Blacks? Or is that just the Eden Park factor? Either way they\u2019re dropping the pill and putting themselves under huge pressure tonight. Such as now, where the ABs have yet another scrum feed. 54 min: There\u2019s a stat I\u2019d missed in the pre-game build up: it\u2019s Steve Hansen\u2019s 100th match in charge of the All Blacks. Feels like his 300th, such has been the influence of the man (who was of course a long-time part of Sir Graham Henry\u2019s staff beforehand). He\u2019s never a man who\u2019d make it about himself, but you\u2019d imagine he\u2019ll happily play out his last match in charge at Eden Park in exactly this kind of fashion. 52 min: Now he\u2019s cleared with a box kick. Smart passage of play from Smith, who is replaced by TJ Perenara and Ofa Tu\u2019ungafasi comes on for Joe Moody. Huge effort tonight from the front rower, who saw his Crusaders partner-in-crime Owen Franks dropped pre-game, and was possibly on notice himself. Questions answered, you\u2019d imagine. 51 min: Nic White jogs off, Will Genia comes on. Experience head, and it hasn\u2019t been the same influence from the young halfback who was possibly best on ground last week in Perth. Genia goes blindside and almost regathers a clever chip-and-chase, but it\u2019s Aaron Smith who reads the play brilliantly and snuffs out the danger. 48 min: Big test of character, and confidence for the Wallabies. They can\u2019t afford to collapse from here. Both sides shuffle their packs, a few changes, I\u2019ll try to bring you those. I think Alaalatoa has definitely left the field after the head knock, and it might be Toomua on for Lealiifano. And it is the subs Toomua and Tupou - Tongan Thor - who nearly combine for a terrific counter punch! Mr Ellyse Perry was through the middle before Tupou hung onto a tricky bootlace pass - but he\u2019d outpaced his runners. Turnover - but a fine burst from Australia. 45 min: We set for a scrum - NZ feed about 15m out. Big opportunity for a backline set piece. Savea picks up from scrum and they go right. He pops a pass back inside to find a runner, before SBW hits a sharp line! What a flying intervention and he\u2019s burst over the try-line despite heavy traffic. We go to a TMO to see if he\u2019s grounded, which he has. Extras added from Mo\u2019unga. No way back from here for Australia, surely. 44 min: They build the phases, NZ, as Sonny Bill joins the forwards. But a stop in play with Alaalatoa copping a heavy front-on head knock in the tackle on Sonny Bill. The All Blacks take the chance to get Dane Coles back on the pitch. Was that even ten?! I guess playing two minutes after the first-half hooter counts. They\u2019ve got away with 14 this week, New Zealand. 42 min: Huge push from the ABs! Scott Sio shakes his head ruefully, they\u2019ve won another big push, New Zealand and earned the penalty. Ardie Savea has detached from the scrum-bind before the feed - skipped over to the other side, and they\u2019ve pivoted the Wallabies front row again! Clever stuff - Australia will need to adjust. 40 min: We\u2019re back and it\u2019s an inauspicious start from the Wallabies, as Adam Coleman appears to knock on from the restart! Jaco Peyper takes pity, and replays suggest the kick hadn\u2019t perhaps gone the requisite 10m. Scrum bang on half way, Australia have the feed. Set piece time? So - a deep breath (or ten) for Wallabies fans. What just happened?! And conversely, All Blacks fans - could there have been more points there for the taking? Your thoughts on that first stanza? Scott Probst has written in: well, it looks like Australia have begun digging their own grave... again... Harsh perhaps? It\u2019s true that there\u2019s absolutely no margin for error at this level. Especially at Eden Park. It\u2019s a rare let off! Mo\u2019unga pushes his strike just to the right of the posts - it must be difficult conditions for the kickers with both No 10s missing very gettable shots. And that\u2019s all we have! A pulsating first 40 minutes from Eden Park. It\u2019s a welcome return for fans of \u201cfrustrated Michael Cheika\u201d watch - he\u2019s pacing his technical box like a panther with glass in its paws. They haven\u2019t been poor, Australia - but with 40 gone, they\u2019re on the ropes! 40 min: We set for a scrum, ABs feed about 10m out. They get a push moving - despite 7-v-8 in the scrum, Smith looks to flick right and Reece does brilliantly to almost find the line - but three Wallabies scramble well to stop the debutant winger. We come back for a penalty - they think about the quick tap but the cooler heads prevail. Read points to the sticks. 38 min: What can Australia make of the advantage? It would be a huge boost if they can get on the scoreboard. It\u2019s not a 17-0 half, but until otherwise, that\u2019s how it will currently read. The All Blacks keep ball in hand and they look to slow it down. Oh my! It\u2019s another dropped ball from Beale! Deary me - he\u2019s spilled another one - his second of the game. If that was at the MCG they\u2019d be yelling \u201cfootsteps\u201d! There was nobody near the fullback. Huge mistake - and the All Blacks are on the attack, despite the man disadvantage! 36 min: They drive for the line, New Zealand, but we go upstairs for a TMO. Dane Coles has grabbed Nic White off the ball as part of a clear out - it\u2019s an arm round the neck, referee Jaco Peyper, is calling it a judo throw, and he\u2019s apparently just warned the veteran front rower. Yellow card! He\u2019s not happy about it, Coles. Nor are the home crowd. But silver lining - they\u2019re only temporarily down to 14, as opposed to last week. 34 min: How cruel can sport be? Having weathered an early storm they were slowly building into this contest, the Wallabies. Lealiifano\u2019s twin misses was a blow, but that was a rapid one-two punch combo from the All Blacks - and it\u2019s completely knocked the stuffing out of those in gold! They\u2019re too good not to hurt you, New Zealand. And there\u2019s a bit of frustration out there, as the All Blacks kick for the line once again and look to add further injury to insult. 31 min: They\u2019ve not done too much wrong over the past ten minutes or so, the Wallabies but all of a sudden, it\u2019s almost goodnight nurse o\u2019clock. Barrett starts the counterattack from fullback with ball in hand. He charges to the line, puts George Bridge into a hole out wide, and the young winger finds backup on the inside from Aaron Smith. A lightning raid from the All Blacks - some champagne stuff, from the world\u2019s most fearsome rugby team! Mo\u2019unga adds the extras. Half-time can\u2019t come soon enough for Australia. 28 min: We\u2019ve heard about the fabled All Blacks counterattack, and that\u2019s terrific hands from the flyhalf. The Wallabies looked to spread wide, seeing half a gap. It was a flicked pass from Beale, and Hodge nominally over-ran it and the ball went to ground. It was Mo\u2019unga, quick as a whippet, onto it, and he runs away to the line! Well-struck conversion. It\u2019s a perfect 10, from the No 10, as he registers all the opening points of this game. 26 min: Laulala penalised for collapsing, and the Wallabies clear their lines. Both teams seemed to be under pressure there - perhaps it was the Wallabies front row that went down first? Referees give benefit of the doubt to the team just in front of their own line. 24 min: Knock on as Savea and Laulala get confused. The backrower leaves the pass from Smith and it\u2019s a genuine falcon! The unsuspecting prop never saw that coming and it goes to ground, off the noggin. Bizarre mistake from the ABs. Big pressure scrum now, after Australia were monstered in the opening set piece of the match. Penalty miss! My, oh my. From 22m out the Australian flyhalf has struck it dead straight, but the over side of the sticks! He\u2019s over-corrected from his curling effort left, and hit it dart straight - but the radar was off. What a morale-buster for the forwards in gold who\u2019ve just expended so much energy. Huge miss from Lealiifano! 20 min: Australia with ball-in-hand. Despite missing the three points they\u2019ve enjoyed a decent patch of possession here. Can they capitalise? Two or three times bodies in gold have crossed the line, only to be driven back - Alaalatoa, Beale - this is absolutely immense defence! But decent pressure from Australia as well. What a contest! We come back again for a penalty. All of this coming about after another missed lineout throw from the ABs. Uncharacteristic from the veteran Coles. Penalty miss! It was just off to the left, but still relatively straight on. Lealiifano with his trademark curling strike, but it\u2019s bended too much and bounces back off the left upright, to the delight of the home fans. How big a moment could that prove? On such fine margins (etc). 16 min: Nic White takes it to the line, Naisarani ducks the head and tries to burrow through. We come back for a penalty - New Zealand guilty of tackling a player without the ball. 14 min: Hodge looks for touch. They\u2019ve had 37% possession so far, Australia. A big turnaround from Perth (even before the red card to Scott Barrett). They look for the line - Hodge flicks to Koroibete, who hairs for the corner; but the defence is too good! Three get hold of the flying winger, and they turn him over a metre short of the line! 12 min: New Zealand with all the early ball in hand. White clears with a box kick and Barrett returns fire to Beale from the boot. The Australian fullback runs it, and then Kerevi hits the line hard, but they\u2019ve forced the turnover again with some strong defence, the home side. Savea busts down the left, and they\u2019re lining up down the left-hand edge. Penalty! Moody infringes and the Wallabies survive. 10 min: Beauden Barrett chances the drop kick! Ooph, that\u2019s not far away. They\u2019re full of tricks and industry early on today. The fullback fires that one from about 35m out - it was well struck, but just to the right of the uprights. A let off for the Wallabies, who take in the early breather. If you missed the earlier fixture between the women\u2019s sides that finished 37-8. Will we see a similar scoreline here? Here\u2019s Jill Scanlon\u2019s match report. 7 min: Nic White gets creamed at the base of a ruck, and he only just hangs onto the ball as a wall of Black flies through to clean out. Barrett kicks smartly for the side and puts Hodge under a full gamut of pressure. It\u2019s a bright start from the ABs! 5 min: Deary me. It\u2019s a forward pass, I think from Lealiifano, who has hit as the ABs rushed out of the line. It\u2019s a terrible start from the visitors - not how they\u2019d have wanted to, and in stark contrast to last week\u2019s game. 3 min: No mistake. He strikes it well, Mo\u2019unga, and there\u2019s the early nerve settler. Not that they\u2019ve shown too many yet, the All Blacks. 1 min: They kick for touch, the ABs but it\u2019s a wild throw from Dane Coles - that wet, slippery ball could wreak havoc tonight - but Wallaby hands fail to reel it in, and there\u2019s a knock on, and a scrum feed to New Zealand. They throw it about, under a penalty advantage after their scrum monstered their opponents, but it goes to ground. They come back and Richie Mo\u2019unga - not Beauden Barrett - will line up for an early shot at the sticks. We\u2019re away, and it\u2019s Lealiifano who kicks off, shallow. But it goes into touch and the All Blacks start with an early feed. Australia impinge from the lineout and we\u2019ve a very early penalty! Not the auspicious start, Michael Cheika would have wanted. Haka! It\u2019s TJ Perenara, as we\u2019ve become accustomed to see, leading the Haka. Some stern faces on the front of the debutant youngsters Reece and Bridges. Aaron Smith and Ardie Savea with some fierce actions. And he may not have sung the anthem but it\u2019s a highly engaged Sonny Bill. It\u2019s a variant from the haka we saw in Perth - and a big stare straight at their opponents. Unbelievable stuff. Brings a lump to your throat, every time. Anthems: Australia first, as the guests. And then the nation with two less stars on their flag. There\u2019s a fair contingent of Wallabies fans in, and they belt it out with gusto. Despite what is quickly becoming heavier rain pouring down. New Zealand / Aotearoa\u2019s anthem also impeccably observed by some sturdily rugged up locals. It\u2019s a tight one, but you\u2019d call an early 3-0 to the home side as an army of be-ponchoed fans stood as one. Weather watch: there\u2019s a light spattering of rain - just how we like it for treacherous ball conditions - over Auckland. It does appear a dark and stormy night there. And as the players come out onto the Eden Park pitch, some memorials for recently departed All Blacks. A sombre start to what will shortly become, you\u2019d imagine, a cauldron-like atmosphere. We\u2019re not a million miles from kick-off, so let\u2019s review the team news: As expected, only injury has altered Michael Cheika\u2019s winning formula from Perth last weekend. In comes Adam Coleman from the start, with Rory Arnold out. It might not get too many headlines, but that\u2019s a huge out, especially with no Brodie Retallick in the opposite 15, and an area where Australia did well in game one. Liam Wright could come on for his first cap, therefore. What a place to do it. Meanwhile, Adam Ashley-Cooper returns to the bench, and could pick up his 118th cap. Australia: (15-1) Kurtley Beale, Marika Koroibete, James O\u2019Connor, Samu Kerevi, Reece Hodge, Christian Lealiifano, Nic White, Isi Naisarani, Michael Hooper (captain), Lukhan Salakaia-Loto, Adam Coleman, Izack Rodda, Allan Alaalatoa, Tolu Latu, Scott Sio. Bench: Folau Fainga\u2019a, James Slipper, Taniela Tupou, Rob Simmons, Liam Wright, Will Genia, Matt Toomua, Adam Ashley-Cooper. For Steve Hansen, it\u2019s a raft of changes - both wingers, Ben Smith and Rieko Ioane are out, in come Sevu Reece and George Bridge for their first-ever All Blacks caps. Sonny Bill Williams returns for the injured Jack Goodhue, and Scott Barrett\u2019s suspension sees Patrick Tuipulotu come into the back row. Finally, Nepo Laulala replaces veteran Owen Franks at prop. New Zealand: Beauden Barrett, Sevu Reece, Anton Lienert-Brown, Sonny Bill Williams, George Bridge, Richie Mo\u2019unga, Aaron Smith, Kieran Read (captain), Sam Cane, Ardie Savea, Sam Whitelock, Patrick Tuipulotu, Nepo Laulala, Dane Coles, Joe Moody. Bench: Codie Taylor, Ofa Tu\u2019ungafasi, Angus Ta\u2019avao, Jackson Hemopo, Matt Todd, TJ Perenara, Ngani Laumape, Jordie Barrett. \u201cMichael, do you believe in hoodoos?\u201d It was an unorthodox question put to Wallabies coach Michael Cheika pre-game, and one that appeared to take the Australian supremo a little off guard. It prompted the expected platitudes about \u201cjust focusing on our game\u201d - but be sure that his chargers are well aware of the scale of what lies before them. Still, five losses since 2017, the ABs. They\u2019re the premier team in World Rugby, but they\u2019re not invincible. Like Ireland in Chicago, the Wallabies will know that history is there to be written. Hi all! Thanks for joining us today, from wherever around the world you\u2019re hopping on to Guardian\u2019s coverage. There was huge interest in last week\u2019s match, and given there\u2019s a Bledisloe Cup at stake, expect today to be even bigger. As always - we\u2019d love to hear from you: predictions? key stats? historical reveries? Fire us an email or tweet to join the coverage. Were you there in 1986, the last time Australia won at Eden Park? Let us know. 1986. Like something akin to a George Orwell novel, Eden Park has become a dystopian wasteland for Australian rugby, with Australia failing to record a win there in the past 18 attempts. One of the fabled stadia of world sport, if the Wallabies are to end a 16-year Bledisloe hoodoo, it will have to be in spectacular fashion - at the very heart of enemy territory. The All Blacks will be chastened, smarting even, after last Saturday\u2019s record 47-26 loss in Perth. It\u2019s one thing to catch a premier team, reduced to 14 men, on the hop - it\u2019s another thing entirely to beat a full complement of 15, that well and truly know you\u2019re coming. Still, the All Blacks have shown some uncharacteristic errors creeping into their game, and confidence will be high in the Wallabies dressing room after one of their best performances, especially in recent memory. So get excited for this one. Feed the cats, do the chores you\u2019ve been asked, because this one is strictly \u201cno distractions\u201d category.",

      "bodyText": "The US justice department has issued a warrant for the seizure of the Iranian oil tanker at the centre of a weeks-long diplomatic dispute, just a day after a Gibraltar judge allowed the release of the detained vessel. The move by Washington marks a significant escalation in its efforts to tighten economic sanctions against Iran, trying to detain a tanker that Gibraltar had said was no longer impounded under EU sanctions. The supertanker Grace 1 was seized in early July by the British overseas territory of Gibraltar, prompting Iran to seize a British flagged tanker in apparent retaliation a fortnight later. Authorities in Gibraltar \u2013 with the backing of the British \u2013 had said the vessel was heading for Syria in breach of EU sanctions barring the sale of oil to the regime of Bashar al-Assad. Gibraltar agreed to release the tanker after Tehran promised that its $140m (\u00a3115m) cargo would no longer be transported to Syria. The United States has called for the seizure of the ship, which was still anchored in Gibraltar, for \u201ca scheme to unlawfully access the US financial system to support illicit shipments to Syria from Iran by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), a designated foreign terrorist organisation\u201d, the justice department said. The warrant says the vessel, all the oil aboard and $995,000 are subject to forfeiture based on violations of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), and bank fraud, money laundering, and terrorism forfeiture statutes. Earlier on Friday, Iranian officials said the tanker was preparing to set sail after a Gibraltar judge ordered its release. But according to an AFP source, the ship was awaiting the arrival of a new crew before it would leave Gibraltar. The Grace 1 was to be renamed and switch to the Iranian flag for its onward journey, the deputy head of Iran\u2019s ports and maritime organisation, Jalil Eslami, told Iranian state television Friday. The warrant for the seizure of the tanker, which carries 2.1m barrels of oil, was issued by the US district court for the District of Columbia and addressed to \u201cthe United States Marshal\u2019s Service and/or any other duly authorised law enforcement officer\u201d.",

The body of the 15-year-old, who had severe learning difficulties, was discovered less than two miles from an eco-holiday resort where her family had been staying. Nora\u2019s family have said they are hoping for \u201cmore answers to our many questions\u201d after an autopsy revealed the London schoolgirl probably died due to starvation and stress after surviving a week in the jungle. But reports attributed to an unnamed source have since suggested that her parents are considering asking for a second postmortem to ensure no evidence was missed. On Saturday, the family issued a statement via the Lucie Blackman Trust \u2013 a charity that supports British nationals in crisis overseas \u2013 saying: \u201cThe family of Nora Quoirin would like to clarify several comments that have been attributed to the family or to people claiming to act on behalf of the family. \u201cThey wish it to be made absolutely clear that the only comments and statements relating to the disappearance, death, investigation and any other matters that are actually from the family are those released via Matthew Searle of the Lucie Blackman Trust.\u201d It added: \u201cAny other comments and views are those of the speaker and do not necessarily reflect the views of the immediate family or an accurate portrayal of the facts.\u201d It continued: \u201cNora\u2019s family are concerned that continued reporting of comments such as those recently reported are unhelpful and may hinder any investigations, as well as causing confusion and distress for them.\u201d The Lucie Blackman Trust was arranging repatriation of Nora\u2019s body, the statement added. The new statement follows Nora\u2019s Irish mother and French father, Meabh and Sebastien \u2013 who live in London \u2013 meeting the Malaysian deputy prime minister, Wan Azizah, on Friday during which she paid her respects to the family. After the postmortem, Malaysian police said that Nora starved to death after her disappearance and \u201cfor the time being\u201d there was no evidence of abduction or kidnapping. The teenager is likely to have spent a week in the jungle, dying between two and four days before her body was discovered, the postmortem examination revealed. Further analysis is also due on samples taken from her body.

      "body": "<p>One fine Montr\u00e9al fall morning, I sat at the kitchen table, writing, the cat fed and purring, the teapot still half full, in a sacred moment of flow, when the doorbell rang. I let my boyfriend answer it and eavesdropped from the kitchen.</p> <p>\u201cOui, bonjour.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHello, I\u2019m looking for the woman of the house.\u201d</p> <p>Fishman! Oh no, not Fishman. He\u2019d swum in on a wave of 90% humidity, back in the heat of the summer, hollered through my open front door, and tried to sell me fish. Arguably, he had also tried to chat me up. Both of these endeavours had been unsuccessful. His return did not thrill me.</p> <p>Hopefully my Frenchman would dispatch him.</p> <p>\u201cComment? Vous cherchez qui?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe woman of the house. The woman who lives here. She knows me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVendeur du poisson. The woman who lives here. Can you get her for me?\u201d</p> <p>Although we live in a Francophone neighbourhood, Fishman delivered these last lines in a slow and mocking English. He seemed insulted that his presence should be questioned. I could hear my usually calm Frenchman\u2019s voice take on the particular irritation of a man who opens his front door to another man who refuses to tell him what he is doing there.</p> <p>\u201cBut what do you want?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLook, the woman who lives here. The woman I guess would be your mother. Can you get her for me please?\u201d</p> <p>His mother.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Oh, you two are together,\u201d she said. We call each other \u201cmon amour\u201d. What did she think we were?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Now, I am a little older than my fella. Seven years to be exact. Seven and a half to be exacter. We are not <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067185/\" title=\"\">Harold and Maude</a>. We are not even Brigitte and Macron. Could anyone realistically mistake me for his mother? Don\u2019t get me wrong, his mother is very lovely and very pretty and, under different circumstances, I would be honoured to be mistaken for her. But she is also in her 60s, while I am in my 30s.</p> <p>The cogs of my brain smoked as I struggled to process the category error.</p> <p>I think that when Fishman \u2013 mid-50s, bearded, baseball-capped \u2013 first intruded upon me in the swelter of the summer he saw a woman in his dating bracket.</p> <p>This is not Fishman\u2019s fault, bless his polycotton blend socks. He has, like many men in their 50s, spent his life being deeply misled by the telly, where male leads his age and older are paired with pretty, flitty wee fillies in their 20s and younger. This has skewed his sense of reality.</p> <p>It has skewed all of our senses of reality, to be honest. I remember watching the chemistry between Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford in Star Wars: The Force Awakens and thinking, \u201cWoah, that\u2019s weird, she\u2019s too old for him.\u201d But Fisher was 14 years younger than Ford. I was so used to seeing Harrison dripping in women a third of his age that a more demographically realistic romantic interest jarred.</p> <p>This is strange because if you stop looking at screens and look out of windows instead you notice that most people tend to date in and around their own age group. Beautiful 22-year-old women usually throw themselves at handsome 22-year-old men, not at dandies they picked up down the bingo. Decades-long age gaps are real and perfectly cool, and age is just a number, and love is love, and love is all you need etc, but such gaps are also not the norm. Yet, as a woman in her 30s, I can roundly attest that men in their 50s do not seem to know this.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5aee1bc8115eb3f58ad1681d9230a6823a7ea1bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5aee1bc8115eb3f58ad1681d9230a6823a7ea1bd/0_192_1280_768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Emer O\u2019Toole and her boyfriend.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emer O\u2019Toole and her boyfriend.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Emer O\u2019Toole</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So Fishman gets to my door, and expects to find a woman in his general league. When the door is opened instead by a handsome young man in his 20s, it does not compute. Thus, I must be my boyfriend\u2019s mother.</p> <p>Now, you might be thinking, what has handsome got to do with it? Is she just finding opportunities to boast about her sexy boyfriend? And yes I am, but, nonetheless, I think handsome is part of the equation. Because not only is my boyfriend a little younger than me, which is not the norm, he is also a little hotter than me, which is not de rigueur either. I know. It\u2019s a cross I bear.</p> <p>When we first started dating, I thought I was just wearing my \u201cI fancy you\u201d glasses, which are very like beer googles except that you can\u2019t take them off. But then I started to introduce the Frenchman to my friends, or to send the odd photo of us on a city break to my Irish girls WhatsApp group. The responses were less, \u201cAww, you guys are cute\u201d and more \u201chot damn\u201d. This gave me pause. Was everyone wearing my I fancy you glasses?</p> <p>After her first introduction to my Frenchman, my friend Alexa made a number of physical observations along the lines of: \u201cBut you didn\u2019t tell me he was so\u2026 tall\u201d, \u201cBut you didn\u2019t tell me he was so\u2026 blond.\u201d And I joked, \u201cHe is very good-looking, isn\u2019t he? Maybe he\u2019s just with me for my apartment.\u201d \u201cNo offence,\u201d said Alexa, \u201cbut if that man was gold-digging, he could sleep his way into a better apartment.\u201d This was strangely comforting.</p> <p>It is evident that Fishman could not help but be confused, the poor lamb. I mean, take 20 seconds to think of a celebrity pairing \u2013 real or fictional, past or present \u2013 where the woman is more beautiful than the man. Easy, isn\u2019t it? Harvey Weinstein and Georgina Chapman. Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z. Kirsten Dunst and that guy from Fargo. The romantic leads in every single Woody Allen film. It\u2019s just too simple.</p> <p>Then try it in reverse. Twenty seconds. I\u2019m counting. Whatcha got? Nothing? Me neither. So I Googled it and found my way to a chic listicle entitled, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.yourtango.com/2016290979/25-smokin-hot-celebrities-just-average-looking-spouses\" title=\"\">Twenty-Five Smokin\u2019 Hot Celebrities With Just Average-Looking Spouses</a>\u201d and was told that Christian Bale and Matt Damon are both married to less attractive women. I eagerly Googled their ostensibly homely honeys only to find that I\u2019d been lied to and both wives are, disappointingly, very beautiful indeed.</p> <p>I\u2019m not sure this trope can be dismissed by looking out of the window quite as easily. I think that very attractive women are more likely to date regular looking blokes than vice versa. Women are less shallow than men, you see. This is the only explanation I am interested in or will accept, and anyone coming at me with evolutionary psychology about women\u2019s innate desire for resources and men\u2019s innate desire for lithe yoga instructors will be put directly in the bin.</p> <p>(Wait \u2013 does this mean I\u2019m shallow for dating a more attractive man? No, no. Not I. I\u2019m so deep I don\u2019t even see beauty.)</p> <p>On the doorstep, my Frenchman was out of patience. He told Fishman to wait and came to fetch me from my writing nest, from whence I made my finest \u201cDon\u2019t make me go out there\u201d eyes, then reluctantly followed him out to the hall.</p> <p>\u201cThe woman of the house!\u201d said Fishman.</p> <p>\u201cYes, hello.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d he said, gesturing to my Frenchman, \u201cthe security?\u201d</p> <p>Yes, this is my son, the security. I birthed him when I was seven by way of a biological miracle and sent him directly to jujitsu camp in Paris, where he spent 25 years acquiring deadly martial arts skills and an impeccable French accent, before moving to Qu\u00e9bec to protect me, his recently relocated Irish child-mother, from murderers, thieves, and door-to-door fish salesmen.</p> <p>I did not say this. Instead, I said, \u201cThat is my boyfriend.\u201d But I am confident that my tone communicated \u201cand your error, sir, in mistaking him for my son, has ensured that I will never, ever purchase any of your seafood.\u201d</p> <p>Fishman curled his lips into a snarl. Then he circled, dived off my stoop, and cut his way through the crisp of the day.</p> <p>At first, I liked the story of Fishman thinking I was my boyfriend\u2019s mother. I told it to everyone, laughing, in a \u201cCan you believe it!\u201d vein, and everyone obliged me by insisting that, no they could not believe it and isn\u2019t it funny, and who could possibly make that mistake?</p> <p>My Frenchman, conversely, did not like the story one bit. He thinks Fishman was trying to provoke him by telling him to go get his mother and then asking me if he was the security. \u201cFoo-king guy,\u201d remains his main analysis of the situation, masking a depth of complex heterosexual man emotions.</p> <p>With time, I find I too like the tale of Fishman less, because it has made me sense the water in which we all swim in a way I didn\u2019t before. When a fellow student at the art class my Frenchman and I attend remarked harmlessly, but with a note of surprise, \u201cOh, you two are together,\u201d I parsed her meaning. After all, she\u2019d sat right next to us for the last four still life sessions. We call each other \u201cmon amour\u201d and share all our brushes and paints. What did she think we were?</p> <p>There are plenty of metaphorical fish in the proverbial sea, but the expected patterns of how they should choose a mate are actually pretty limiting. I wonder how many women would never date a younger man, even if they wanted the same things from life, because of a subconscious awareness of social perception? I wonder how many men wouldn\u2019t follow that delicious chemistry to a woman who lights them right up, because they feel that, looks-wise, they could do better?</p> <p>But fear not, my Frenchman and I will continue to swim bravely upstream to spawn, battling the current of social expectation, avoiding the anglers\u2019 hooks of judgment, politely correcting other salmon who mistake us for Mama Fish and recently hatched fry. For feminism, you understand. It\u2019s a tough job, and, admittedly, I am selfless, but if someone\u2019s got to do it, why shouldn\u2019t it be me?</p> <p>\u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email <a href=\"mailto:\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

      "bodyText": "One fine Montr\u00e9al fall morning, I sat at the kitchen table, writing, the cat fed and purring, the teapot still half full, in a sacred moment of flow, when the doorbell rang. I let my boyfriend answer it and eavesdropped from the kitchen. \u201cOui, bonjour.\u201d \u201cHello, I\u2019m looking for the woman of the house.\u201d Fishman! Oh no, not Fishman. He\u2019d swum in on a wave of 90% humidity, back in the heat of the summer, hollered through my open front door, and tried to sell me fish. Arguably, he had also tried to chat me up. Both of these endeavours had been unsuccessful. His return did not thrill me. Hopefully my Frenchman would dispatch him. \u201cComment? Vous cherchez qui?\u201d \u201cThe woman of the house. The woman who lives here. She knows me.\u201d \u201cWho are you?\u201d \u201cVendeur du poisson. The woman who lives here. Can you get her for me?\u201d Although we live in a Francophone neighbourhood, Fishman delivered these last lines in a slow and mocking English. He seemed insulted that his presence should be questioned. I could hear my usually calm Frenchman\u2019s voice take on the particular irritation of a man who opens his front door to another man who refuses to tell him what he is doing there. \u201cBut what do you want?\u201d \u201cLook, the woman who lives here. The woman I guess would be your mother. Can you get her for me please?\u201d His mother. Now, I am a little older than my fella. Seven years to be exact. Seven and a half to be exacter. We are not Harold and Maude. We are not even Brigitte and Macron. Could anyone realistically mistake me for his mother? Don\u2019t get me wrong, his mother is very lovely and very pretty and, under different circumstances, I would be honoured to be mistaken for her. But she is also in her 60s, while I am in my 30s. The cogs of my brain smoked as I struggled to process the category error. I think that when Fishman \u2013 mid-50s, bearded, baseball-capped \u2013 first intruded upon me in the swelter of the summer he saw a woman in his dating bracket. This is not Fishman\u2019s fault, bless his polycotton blend socks. He has, like many men in their 50s, spent his life being deeply misled by the telly, where male leads his age and older are paired with pretty, flitty wee fillies in their 20s and younger. This has skewed his sense of reality. It has skewed all of our senses of reality, to be honest. I remember watching the chemistry between Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford in Star Wars: The Force Awakens and thinking, \u201cWoah, that\u2019s weird, she\u2019s too old for him.\u201d But Fisher was 14 years younger than Ford. I was so used to seeing Harrison dripping in women a third of his age that a more demographically realistic romantic interest jarred. This is strange because if you stop looking at screens and look out of windows instead you notice that most people tend to date in and around their own age group. Beautiful 22-year-old women usually throw themselves at handsome 22-year-old men, not at dandies they picked up down the bingo. Decades-long age gaps are real and perfectly cool, and age is just a number, and love is love, and love is all you need etc, but such gaps are also not the norm. Yet, as a woman in her 30s, I can roundly attest that men in their 50s do not seem to know this. So Fishman gets to my door, and expects to find a woman in his general league. When the door is opened instead by a handsome young man in his 20s, it does not compute. Thus, I must be my boyfriend\u2019s mother. Now, you might be thinking, what has handsome got to do with it? Is she just finding opportunities to boast about her sexy boyfriend? And yes I am, but, nonetheless, I think handsome is part of the equation. Because not only is my boyfriend a little younger than me, which is not the norm, he is also a little hotter than me, which is not de rigueur either. I know. It\u2019s a cross I bear. When we first started dating, I thought I was just wearing my \u201cI fancy you\u201d glasses, which are very like beer googles except that you can\u2019t take them off. But then I started to introduce the Frenchman to my friends, or to send the odd photo of us on a city break to my Irish girls WhatsApp group. The responses were less, \u201cAww, you guys are cute\u201d and more \u201chot damn\u201d. This gave me pause. Was everyone wearing my I fancy you glasses?

Maybe he\u2019s just with me for my apartment.\u201d \u201cNo offence,\u201d said Alexa, \u201cbut if that man was gold-digging, he could sleep his way into a better apartment.\u201d This was strangely comforting. It is evident that Fishman could not help but be confused, the poor lamb.

      "body": "<p>Ikaria was arcadian, Kalymnos devilishly entertaining and Amorgos hauntingly beautiful. So far, my Greek island-hopping adventure has delivered, but as I reach Folegandros, my faith wobbles. I\u2019m in Chora, as the main towns on many of these islands are called, it\u2019s evening and hundreds of well-heeled visitors, dressed in tailored summerwear, are settling in to the artful maze of outdoor eating areas. It\u2019s all very chi-chi, with not a donkey plop in sight. Will Pierce Brosnan leap out and attempt to sing? Has Folegandros sold its soul?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/08/greece_map_web/giv-3902b0H3bQxwj0K3/\" data-alt=\"Aegean map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/08/greece_map_web/giv-3902b0H3bQxwj0K3/\">Aegean map</a> <figcaption>A map of Kevin Rushby\u2019s Greek island-hopping adventure</figcaption> </figure>  <p>I examine the portents and they are not good. On the way here the ferry stopped at neighbouring Santorini. There were three giant cruise ships in the bay, a coach jam on the cliff and, as we disembarked, a socialite in stilettoes tripped on the ferry gangplank, causing a pink wheelie bag pile-up. A Japanese wedding party came aboard, exhausted but still bingeing on selfies. It was all a bit instagrim.</p> <p>Next morning, though, Chora is unrecognisable from the night before: old ladies are sweeping the steps where kittens play. I get disoriented in the twisting alleyways and emerge on the edge of an impressive cliff. An ancient cobbled road leads me back inland, suggesting I might like to explore a different part of the island. Today, I decide, I will follow my nose.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"26cfb74024892947577254113732e8258f565ec6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26cfb74024892947577254113732e8258f565ec6/0_384_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Snails for the table\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Snails for the table.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Rushby</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I take a stony path across the island and down to a beach at the village of Agkali. There is only one person around \u2013 a young lad collecting snails among the sage. \u201c<em>Karavoli</em>,\u201d he says, miming eating. After another cove I loop inland, climbing past an abandoned village, then down to a lighthouse on a jutting headland. The narrow path then leads across a cliff face above a fjord of translucent turquoise water to a gorgeous deserted beach where I swim, and fall asleep.</p> <p>When I wake up there are two naked people lying asleep at the water\u2019s edge, like the Venus de Milo and her consort washed up. Feeling overdressed, I press on up the coast, hoping there will be a bus back to Chora from wherever I end up. This early morning stroll has turned into an epic hike. A detour takes me down cliffs dotted with samphire to rock pools filled with pure white sea salt, like slush in my hands. It tastes utterly divine.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6d1d1becc09e24bd142aff042dcf095fc8fb0e6c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d1d1becc09e24bd142aff042dcf095fc8fb0e6c/0_0_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Agkali beach\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Agkali beach.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefano Zaccaria/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/jul/28/aegean-greek-island-hopping-odyssey-ikaria-longevity\">All over the Aegean: a great Greek island-hopping odyssey</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I walk back up the mountain in the heat and reach the road that runs down the spine of the island. I\u2019m now desperate for a drink and head for the nearest building which turns out to be the Iliovasilema (sunset) taverna. A man rides past on a donkey. Both of them appear to be asleep. The menu on the door states: chicken, rabbit, pigeon, meat balls, cheese. In the kitchen an elderly man in a white vest is rolling out flatbreads while a woman chops tomatoes. Now I know where this walk is going: to real Greece.</p> <p>I\u2019m feeling the effect of my exertions. Sweat drips from me. I\u2019m dizzy and dehydrated. I drink a litre of tap water. My clothes are soaking. I retire to the bathroom and change into the only alternative outfit available: my swimming trunks. I hang my clothes outside in the sun and sit down. The old man says nothing; he just keeps rolling the bread.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"40367d9926f703ed38f22827dae47eb4d810cc22\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40367d9926f703ed38f22827dae47eb4d810cc22/0_280_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Horiatiki (Greek salad) at Sunset Taverna.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><em>Horiatiki</em> (Greek salad) at Sunset Taverna.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Rushby</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They bring me a Greek salad: tiny pungent olives, homemade cheese, home-grown onions, cool cucumber and sun-soaked tomatoes. Slowly I am revived. I examine the map: down the cliff on the other side of the island there is a beach, Serfiotiko. I put my clothes back on and leave. The sounds of bread rolling and tomato chopping fade.</p> <p>The village of Ano Meria seems sun-stunned and silent. An octopus hangs on a washing line, plastic buckets stand by stone rainwater cisterns, vines laden with tiny grapes crawl across narrow, terraced fields choked with sage and thyme. Then, from a curtained blue-framed window, comes the sound of someone singing in a high-pitched wail. It can\u2019t be Brosnan, not here. I descend to the sea, popping out on a narrow shingle beach. There\u2019s a patch of shade under a tamarisk tree and I lie down. A lizard comes to inspect me. I fall asleep again.</p> <p>When I wake up the golden light of late afternoon has arrived. I swim then set off, without thinking, taking a cliff path further north to another beach. I know this now means a massive return hike and I\u2019ve no idea how I\u2019ll cope but, frankly, I never want this day to end.

      "bodyText": "Ikaria was arcadian, Kalymnos devilishly entertaining and Amorgos hauntingly beautiful. So far, my Greek island-hopping adventure has delivered, but as I reach Folegandros, my faith wobbles. I\u2019m in Chora, as the main towns on many of these islands are called, it\u2019s evening and hundreds of well-heeled visitors, dressed in tailored summerwear, are settling in to the artful maze of outdoor eating areas. It\u2019s all very chi-chi, with not a donkey plop in sight. Will Pierce Brosnan leap out and attempt to sing? Has Folegandros sold its soul? I examine the portents and they are not good. On the way here the ferry stopped at neighbouring Santorini. There were three giant cruise ships in the bay, a coach jam on the cliff and, as we disembarked, a socialite in stilettoes tripped on the ferry gangplank, causing a pink wheelie bag pile-up. A Japanese wedding party came aboard, exhausted but still bingeing on selfies. It was all a bit instagrim. Next morning, though, Chora is unrecognisable from the night before: old ladies are sweeping the steps where kittens play. I get disoriented in the twisting alleyways and emerge on the edge of an impressive cliff. An ancient cobbled road leads me back inland, suggesting I might like to explore a different part of the island. Today, I decide, I will follow my nose. I take a stony path across the island and down to a beach at the village of Agkali. There is only one person around \u2013 a young lad collecting snails among the sage. \u201cKaravoli,\u201d he says, miming eating. After another cove I loop inland, climbing past an abandoned village, then down to a lighthouse on a jutting headland. The narrow path then leads across a cliff face above a fjord of translucent turquoise water to a gorgeous deserted beach where I swim, and fall asleep. When I wake up there are two naked people lying asleep at the water\u2019s edge, like the Venus de Milo and her consort washed up. Feeling overdressed, I press on up the coast, hoping there will be a bus back to Chora from wherever I end up. This early morning stroll has turned into an epic hike. A detour takes me down cliffs dotted with samphire to rock pools filled with pure white sea salt, like slush in my hands. It tastes utterly divine. I walk back up the mountain in the heat and reach the road that runs down the spine of the island. I\u2019m now desperate for a drink and head for the nearest building which turns out to be the Iliovasilema (sunset) taverna. A man rides past on a donkey. Both of them appear to be asleep. The menu on the door states: chicken, rabbit, pigeon, meat balls, cheese. In the kitchen an elderly man in a white vest is rolling out flatbreads while a woman chops tomatoes. Now I know where this walk is going: to real Greece. I\u2019m feeling the effect of my exertions. Sweat drips from me. I\u2019m dizzy and dehydrated. I drink a litre of tap water. My clothes are soaking. I retire to the bathroom and change into the only alternative outfit available: my swimming trunks. I hang my clothes outside in the sun and sit down. The old man says nothing; he just keeps rolling the bread. They bring me a Greek salad: tiny pungent olives, homemade cheese, home-grown onions, cool cucumber and sun-soaked tomatoes. Slowly I am revived. I examine the map: down the cliff on the other side of the island there is a beach, Serfiotiko. I put my clothes back on and leave. The sounds of bread rolling and tomato chopping fade. The village of Ano Meria seems sun-stunned and silent. An octopus hangs on a washing line, plastic buckets stand by stone rainwater cisterns, vines laden with tiny grapes crawl across narrow, terraced fields choked with sage and thyme. Then, from a curtained blue-framed window, comes the sound of someone singing in a high-pitched wail. It can\u2019t be Brosnan, not here. I descend to the sea, popping out on a narrow shingle beach. There\u2019s a patch of shade under a tamarisk tree and I lie down. A lizard comes to inspect me. I fall asleep again. When I wake up the golden light of late afternoon has arrived. I swim then set off, without thinking, taking a cliff path further north to another beach. I know this now means a massive return hike and I\u2019ve no idea how I\u2019ll cope but, frankly, I never want this day to end. I lose the path and come across a lost garden where the vines have run wild, snaking through self-seeded figs, carobs and aromatic herbs. How those butterflies defy the wind is a mystery. Finally I see the beach far below and, regaining the path, drop down to the sea. I swim and watch a small octopus attended by two dancing green fish at my feet. Once I\u2019m out of the water, the thought of the significant hike back up to Ano Meria is too much. I\u2019ll wait for a boat. Sunset is imminent. Maybe I\u2019ll spend the night under a tree.

Anote Tong said the forum should consider possible sanctions or suspension of Australia for its continued \u201cprotestations\u201d on coal and climate. \u201cWhat is the relevance of Australia\u2019s ongoing protestations in the forum?,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it\u2019s going to continue with that line, it poses a danger to the other countries in that forum. \u201cHow can you justify being part of a family and part of a group which you\u2019re trying to destroy?\u201d Tong, who will be in Canberra next week, is an advocate for low-lying nations that are in danger from sea level rise. He said while other countries were scaling back their reliance on coal, Australia was doing the opposite and \u201cat the same time, it is saying they\u2019re a so-called friend\u201d. \u201cShould there be sanctions imposed? I think that\u2019s a question that leaders are no doubt asking themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cI think these things have got to be expressed.

Her comments were in response to Fijian prime minister Frank Bainimarama telling Guardian Australia that Morrison\u2019s approach during the leaders\u2019 retreat on Thursday was \u201cvery insulting and condescending\u201d and would push nations closer to China. Bainimarama described the leaders\u2019 retreat, which lasted for nearly 12 hours and almost broke down over Australia\u2019s \u201cred lines\u201d on the climate crisis, as \u201cprobably one of the most frustrating days I have ever had\u201d. \u201cI gathered [Morrison] was here only to make sure that the Australian policies were upheld by the Pacific island nations,\u201d Bainimarama said. \u201cI thought Morrison was a good friend of mine; apparently not.\u201d Wong said Morrison\u2019s \u201carrogance has done great damage to our relationships and Australia\u2019s standing in the region\u201d. \u201cHe\u2019s undermined the Pacific step-up and alienated our friends,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s no way to treat our neighbours.

On Saturday, Labor\u2019s climate change spokesman, Mark Butler, said the long-standing relationship with Pacific countries had been damaged by Morrison\u2019s heavy-handedness. \u201cIt just adds insult to injury to have the deputy prime minister of the country then say if you lose your home through sea level rise you\u2019ll be fine because you\u2019ll be able to access some job opportunities in Australia,\u201d Butler said. Labor frontbencher Jason Clare also criticised McCormack\u2019s remarks, saying they showed the Australian government had lost credibility on climate change. \u201cIf you want to have real credibility in a debate with our neighbours ... if you want to have the support of the region, then you need to demonstrate that you are taking climate change seriously,\u201d he said.

      "body": "<p>Samson Odhiambo Otieno\u2019s early life was never going to be easy. Born into a life of poverty in Kibera, Nairobi, at a young age he endured the death of his mother and siblings, and rejection by his new step-mother. Forced out of the only home he knew he became one of Kenya\u2019s street children, living on the road, making his way through life the best he could.</p> \n<p>Otieno, now 29, attended the launch of the Guardian\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/series/kibera-living-in-the-slum\">Kibera: </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/series/kibera-living-in-the-slum\">living in the slum</a> exhibition to catch up with the life he once knew and memories he treasures dearly, through the images of his hometown \u2013 a far cry from where he is now.</p> \n<p>Otieno wanted to contribute to the series by sharing his story.</p> \n<p>\u201cMy mother was only 14 when she had me. Her waters broke when she was alone, her screams alerted our neighbour who rushed to help her. They delivered me there and then, in a small plastic bathing basin. </p> \n<p>\u201cMy mother and father went on to have six more children, three of whom died at an early age from complications that even now I can\u2019t fully understand.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b4b4aedc9fe84c89c47ed32d4f81f33946812d5f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4b4aedc9fe84c89c47ed32d4f81f33946812d5f/0_69_658_823/400.jpg\" alt=\"Samson Otieno aged five with his father, Joannes Otieno, in Kibera, Nairobi\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Samson Otieno aged five with his father, Joannes Otieno, in Kibera, Nairobi.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Samson Otieno</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>When he was 10 years old, Otieno\u2019s mother died from an unknown illness. Living in a struggling household he dropped out of school, his father remarrying a year later. Otieno hoped that his stepmother would unite the family but he was wrong.</p> \n<p>\u201cI could not get along with my stepmother. She thought I was too opinionated to be in the same house as her and made my father choose between me and her. I decided to leave, I was only 11 years old. I left Kibera and lived on the streets between Kisumu and Nairobi.</p> \n<p>\u201cLife was tough, I had no money and no one to care for me. I would hang around with boys of my own age. We would all sleep in the same areas for safety, usually around bus shelters. Sometimes there would be up to 15 of us together. We had no money for food so we ate from bins or begged passersby for money. I avoided stealing as I knew this would bring trouble with the police. I had no clothes to speak of, I would find sacks and turn them into shoes. The larger ones we would wear or sleep in to keep out the weather.</p> \n<p>\u201cI was a street child for four years, but I was one of the lucky ones,\u201d says Otieno, who was rescued by <a href=\"http://pandipieri.org/mission-objective-vision/\">Kisumu Urban Apostolate Programmes</a>, an organisation that rehabilitates and reunites street children with their families. \u201cThey helped me and other street children acquire different skills, from masonry and mechanical engineering to carpentry and fine arts amongst others. I qualified as a stonemason.</p> \n<p>\u201cI have seen too many life changing opportunities pass me by because I didn\u2019t have the qualifications or the right papers.

As the climate crisis continues to drive people away from rural areas and into cities, urbanisation has become a growing issue across the globe.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>The Guardian's Global development team travelled to&nbsp; Africa's biggest slum, Kibera, in Nairobi, Kenya, in an effort to look beyond the stereotypes and myths of life in a slum.</p>\n    <p>Many people living in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.kibera.org.uk/facts-info/\">Kibera</a>&nbsp;work hard, long days. They pay high rents for flimsy shacks on land owned by the government and effectively squatted on by landlords. They have no services and the only taxation comes in the form of protection money demanded by police and gangs. Each day is a struggle to scrape together enough money and food to reach the next.</p>\n    <p>Electricity, clean water, toilets, healthcare and schools are either non-existent or not available to all residents. At any one time, 50% of Kibera's 15- to 25-year-old women are pregnant. Abortion is illegal and contraception scarce. Rape and child sex abuse is endemic. Abuse of drink and drugs is rife. Food is cheap but unhealthy \u2013 fizzy drinks are easier to get than clean water.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Otieno was taken in by his aunt and uncle in Kibera, people he describes as being \u201cthe most selfless people I know\u201d.</p> \n<p>Following Kenya\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jan/28/kenya.international\">post-election violence</a> in 2007\u201308, Otieno and his friends became involved in a peace initiative and in 2010 he became a founding member of Kibera\u2019s first free community library. From a young age, when he sang in a church choir in Kibera, he had a passion for music. </p> \n<p>\u201cI lived in a neighbourhood brimming with talent. I hung out with older boys trying to make it in the music industry. We had small gatherings performing for the neighbourhood at the \u2018practice space\u2019 in Kibera. My first performance was a song written by my then girlfriend who was a poet, I was so nervous, sweaty and couldn\u2019t stop shaking. But people liked it and encouraged me to practice to build my confidence,\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>\u201cI believe that my music saved my life, I would have most likely joined a gang or been killed by the police for being gang affiliated. With police brutality and killings, it just feels like they [police in Kibera] are bloodthirsty. Sometimes they would just decide to kill innocent people and plant guns or drugs on them for fun. A lot of young people, especially men, have been unlucky enough to suffer this fate.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"316b9d232c99fc8e04083ceade03a05cccc6728c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/316b9d232c99fc8e04083ceade03a05cccc6728c/1_105_1368_821/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Samson Otieno, aged 22, teaching young boys in Kibera\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Samson Otieno, aged 22, teaching young boys in Kibera.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Samson Otieno</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cBeing involved with the local charities and arts groups helped me stay out of trouble and to build a reputation with the community. It\u2019s important, as if you are popular in Kibera, they [the police] can\u2019t just gun you down. That could bring too much heat. But sometimes they do, because the police there operate with impunity, and are unlikely to face any serious consequences for their actions.\u201d</p> \n<p>Otieno met his British partner Belinda at a festival in Kenya in 2014, when she was working for a human rights organisation. Two years later they were married, and they now have a five-year-old daughter, Kayla Keshi.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/aug/15/the-people-have-power-kenyas-gang-leader-turned-community-builder\">'The people have power': Kenya's gang leader turned community builder</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Otieno continued to pursue the goals he set for himself, with disappointments and setbacks along the way. \u201cBut in 2016, my good friends Mohammad Abdullah, AKA Shamir, and Louis Oketch, AKA DJ Lorc, urged me to get back in the ring \u2013 Shamir offering vocal lessons and producing most of my music.\u201d</p> \n<p>A Kiberan star was born, as Otieno\u2019s unique style of afro-pop took shape. \u201cI like to experiment.

      "bodyText": "Samson Odhiambo Otieno\u2019s early life was never going to be easy. Born into a life of poverty in Kibera, Nairobi, at a young age he endured the death of his mother and siblings, and rejection by his new step-mother. Forced out of the only home he knew he became one of Kenya\u2019s street children, living on the road, making his way through life the best he could. Otieno, now 29, attended the launch of the Guardian\u2019s Kibera: living in the slum exhibition to catch up with the life he once knew and memories he treasures dearly, through the images of his hometown \u2013 a far cry from where he is now. Otieno wanted to contribute to the series by sharing his story. \u201cMy mother was only 14 when she had me. Her waters broke when she was alone, her screams alerted our neighbour who rushed to help her. They delivered me there and then, in a small plastic bathing basin. \u201cMy mother and father went on to have six more children, three of whom died at an early age from complications that even now I can\u2019t fully understand.\u201d When he was 10 years old, Otieno\u2019s mother died from an unknown illness. Living in a struggling household he dropped out of school, his father remarrying a year later. Otieno hoped that his stepmother would unite the family but he was wrong. \u201cI could not get along with my stepmother. She thought I was too opinionated to be in the same house as her and made my father choose between me and her. I decided to leave, I was only 11 years old. I left Kibera and lived on the streets between Kisumu and Nairobi. \u201cLife was tough, I had no money and no one to care for me. I would hang around with boys of my own age. We would all sleep in the same areas for safety, usually around bus shelters. Sometimes there would be up to 15 of us together. We had no money for food so we ate from bins or begged passersby for money. I avoided stealing as I knew this would bring trouble with the police. I had no clothes to speak of, I would find sacks and turn them into shoes. The larger ones we would wear or sleep in to keep out the weather. \u201cI was a street child for four years, but I was one of the lucky ones,\u201d says Otieno, who was rescued by Kisumu Urban Apostolate Programmes, an organisation that rehabilitates and reunites street children with their families. \u201cThey helped me and other street children acquire different skills, from masonry and mechanical engineering to carpentry and fine arts amongst others. I qualified as a stonemason. \u201cI have seen too many life changing opportunities pass me by because I didn\u2019t have the qualifications or the right papers. If it wasn\u2019t for art I don\u2019t think I would be where I am today.\u201d Otieno was taken in by his aunt and uncle in Kibera, people he describes as being \u201cthe most selfless people I know\u201d. Following Kenya\u2019s post-election violence in 2007\u201308, Otieno and his friends became involved in a peace initiative and in 2010 he became a founding member of Kibera\u2019s first free community library. From a young age, when he sang in a church choir in Kibera, he had a passion for music. \u201cI lived in a neighbourhood brimming with talent. I hung out with older boys trying to make it in the music industry. We had small gatherings performing for the neighbourhood at the \u2018practice space\u2019 in Kibera. My first performance was a song written by my then girlfriend who was a poet, I was so nervous, sweaty and couldn\u2019t stop shaking. But people liked it and encouraged me to practice to build my confidence,\u201d he says. \u201cI believe that my music saved my life, I would have most likely joined a gang or been killed by the police for being gang affiliated. With police brutality and killings, it just feels like they [police in Kibera] are bloodthirsty. Sometimes they would just decide to kill innocent people and plant guns or drugs on them for fun. A lot of young people, especially men, have been unlucky enough to suffer this fate.\u201d \u201cBeing involved with the local charities and arts groups helped me stay out of trouble and to build a reputation with the community. It\u2019s important, as if you are popular in Kibera, they [the police] can\u2019t just gun you down. That could bring too much heat. But sometimes they do, because the police there operate with impunity, and are unlikely to face any serious consequences for their actions.\u201d Otieno met his British partner Belinda at a festival in Kenya in 2014, when she was working for a human rights organisation. Two years later they were married, and they now have a five-year-old daughter, Kayla Keshi. Otieno continued to pursue the goals he set for himself, with disappointments and setbacks along the way. \u201cBut in 2016, my good friends Mohammad Abdullah, AKA Shamir, and Louis Oketch, AKA DJ Lorc, urged me to get back in the ring \u2013 Shamir offering vocal lessons and producing most of my music.\u201d A Kiberan star was born, as Otieno\u2019s unique style of afro-pop took shape. \u201cI like to experiment. I often have an element of more than one genre in my projects. My art is inspired by my environment and personal experiences. My biggest influences include Bob Marley, Shamir Tadeiya, Oliver Mtukudzi, Ray Charles and Lucky Dube,\u201d he explains. In 2017, Otieno and his family moved to the UK. \u201cI got here, loved it, and now we\u2019re building our lives here. This is my third year in the UK.\u201d Using the stage name Tymilyfe, Otieno\u2019s success began to grow. \u201cI released my debut single Lipstick on 14 February 2019 to a warm reception in east Africa. The audio was recorded in Kibera but the visuals shot in London. I later released my second single Wrong Information in May 2019, followed by my latest single Agenda in July, which was also well received.\u201d Otieno is keen to help others less fortunate than himself. He has set up Tymilyfe Limited, a Kenyan-based company committed to supporting talent from less privileged backgrounds in Kenya\u2019s informal settlements. They provide vocal coaching and audio-visual production workshops taught by experts. \u201cMy dream is to be the inspiration that Shamir was to me. I want to be the reason why someone does not give up on their dreams, why someone\u2019s art is putting food on their table. I want to be their inspiration.\u201d Tymilyfe is an acronym for \u201cthank you mum I love you forever\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cThere\u2019s no writing,\u201d Bret Easton Ellis declared recently of millennials. \u201cThey don\u2019t care about literature. None of them read books.\u201d Ellis asserted this during the publicity tour for his book <em>White</em>, a collection of essays about contemporary culture, presumably while his long-suffering millennial boyfriend Todd ripped through the latest Sally Rooney in the next room.</p> <p>Putting aside Ellis\u2019s claim not to know who Rooney is, it\u2019s predictable that literature should be yet another realm in which this generation is dismissed. The anointing of one book as a cultural touchstone, one individual as the oracle, and the fallacy of meritocracy that underpins it, is patently absurd. But as with every other millennial-bashing trope, so is the generalisation about our inability to produce one.</p> <p>As any digital marketeer with their crosshairs on millennials will tell you, the way we \u201cconsume\u201d culture has fragmented. Perhaps that\u2019s why Rooney hasn\u2019t appeared on Ellis\u2019s radar. Put in less depressing terms, we have a greater range of representative voices to choose from than in Ellis\u2019s decadent brat-pack days. The aim of publishing now should be to widen that range further. We don\u2019t need to coalesce and, contrary to what Ellis seems to think leviathans do for literary culture, the less we laud one as the template, the more space we open up for a greater number of new writers to write more books, more freely.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The millennial mood is suspicious. We aren\u2019t desperate to lionise our writers, perhaps associating hyperbole with previous con jobs</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In addition to this cultural fragmentation and welcome increase in diversity, the millennial mood is suspicious. We aren\u2019t desperate to lionise our writers, perhaps associating hyperbole with previous con jobs; the \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d rhetoric that led to 2007-2008\u2019s financial crisis, populist political movements, dodgy claims on the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/15/boris-johnson-we-will-claw-back-350m-a-week-post-brexit-after-all\" title=\"\"> sides of buses</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/apr/28/bahamas-drama-luxury-fyre-festival-turns-into-chaos\" title=\"\">Fyre festival</a>. A certain kind of millennial art can serve to bond certain kinds of millennials together in these uncertain times, but the spotlight on a Rooney or a Phoebe Waller-Bridge can reach an intensity that obscures everyone else (earlier this month, a book of scripts for the two series of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/apr/08/farewell-fleabag-the-most-electrifying-devastating-tv-in-years\" title=\"\">Fleabag</a></em> was subject to <a href=\"https://www.thebookseller.com/news/hotly-tipped-fleabag-scripts-snapped-sceptre-8-way-auction-1054661\" title=\"\">an eight-way auction</a> and sold for a six-figure sum). It\u2019s not that the worlds of Rooney and Waller-Bridge aren\u2019t painfully true for a certain demographic, or that their creators don\u2019t deserve praise and recognition, but the idea that one writer or character can speak for so many in this fractured age seems delusional. Few of us who are actually millennials have taken the phrase \u201cvoice of a generation\u201d seriously since Hannah Horvath used it in Lena Dunham\u2019s <em>Girls</em>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d95195be29350fafd56eb03124127c59dac5f1d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d95195be29350fafd56eb03124127c59dac5f1d7/1099_134_1940_2499/776.jpg\" alt=\"Phoebe Waller-Bridge\" width=\"776\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The spotlight on a Rooney or a Phoebe Waller-Bridge can reach an certain intensity so as that obscures everyone else\u2019 \u2026 Waller-Bridge in <em>Fleabag</em>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Two Brothers/Kevin Baker</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I read Rooney\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jun/01/conversations-with-friends-by-sally-rooney-review\" title=\"\">Conversations with Friends</a></em> in a matter of hours in early June 2017, having heard little about it. The experience was uncanny and electric. If I had to pick my own \u201cgreat millennial novel\u201d it might well be that one, but I\u2019m a cis, white, middle class, metropolitan millennial woman who got a scholarship to a school where I met my own Bobbi, so it was easy to relate. In <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/sally-rooney-i-don-t-respond-to-authority-very-well-1.3719669\" title=\"\">an Irish Times</a> interview, Rooney says: \u201cI certainly never intended to speak for anyone other than myself. Even myself I find it difficult to speak for. My books may well fail as artistic endeavours but I don\u2019t want them to fail for failing to speak for a generation for which I never intended to speak in the first place.\u201d Elsewhere, she has expressed her disdain for literary celebrity. In <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/aug/26/sally-rooney-normal-people-review-elegant-intelligent-tender\" title=\"\">Normal People</a></em>, her male protagonist Connell, a fledgling writer, is alienated by a cohort who turn up to literary events for their rarefied atmosphere and the opportunity to perform culturedness. Rooney, a Marxist, is presumably sceptical of the designation \u201cgreat millennial novelist\u201d too, if only for how it will be used as a marketing strategy to commodify her writing. A \u201cgreat millennial novelist\u201d becomes a product, used to sell other products to other millennials. Such a label undermines the power of a book to speak across generations and to structures of power that govern both the publishing industry and the wider world it reflects.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/may/26/sympathy-olivia-sudjic-review\" title=\"\">When my first novel, </a><em>Sympathy</em>, was published in 2017, one reviewer called it \u201cthe first great Instagram novel\u201d, which, as a marketing strapline, stuck. Some reviewers then dedicated themselves to proving or disproving the claim my own book hadn\u2019t made, which meant discussion of the book was often confined to social media addiction, ignoring surveillance, data capitalism and how such technology shapes our collective future. I was called on to make sweeping statements about my generation, when it seemed more pertinent to talk about the tyranny of algorithms and Cambridge Analytica.</p> <p>In contrast to the ways they are marketed and their media reception, millennial novels, if they have a common aim, push against labels, pedestals and the uncritical lauding of spokespeople. They care more about being relatable to a specific audience than a universal one. This resistance, bordering on impostor syndrome, is part of what makes them feel true to the millennials who read them. The protagonists of these novels eyeroll at marketing taglines, tired hierarchies, male canons and influencers. Self-definition is a millennial forte, but its novelists seem dubious of anything so earnest as defining a literary epoch. Their fictional worlds lambast our need for external validation and commodified selfhood of the kind that feeds late capitalism, even as they acknowledge their complicity and the impossibility of extrication.</p> <p>Some books deal with these themes through realism, as Rooney\u2019s do, alongside Joe Dunthorne\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/02/adulterants-joe-dunthorne-review\" title=\"\">The Adulterants</a>, </em>in which a thirtysomething struggles with impending fatherhood, and Candice Carty-Williams\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/12/queenie-candice-carty-williams-review\" title=\"\">Queenie</a>, </em>whose eponymous heroine is evicted by her ex. There is a seam of very dark satire, as in Ottessa Moshfegh\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/11/my-year-rest-relaxation-ottessa-moshfegh-review\" title=\"\">My Year of Rest and Relaxation</a>,</em> whose nihilistic protagonist finds solace only in unconsciousness, and Halle Butler\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/03/the-new-me-halle-butler-review\" title=\"\">The New Me</a></em>, in which misanthropic Millie attempts to move from office temp to \u201cperm\u201d in the job she despises. An increasing number are more dystopian, such as Luiza Sauma\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/13/everything-you-ever-wanted-by-luiza-sauma-review\" title=\"\">Everything You Ever Wanted</a>, </em>which sees millennial contestants on a reality show relocate to another planet, Ling Ma\u2019s zombie-apocalypse-meets-office-novel <em>Severance</em>, Luke Kennard\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/10/the-transition-luke-kennard-review-gentrification\" title=\"\">The Transition</a>, </em>about young people compelled to participate in a scheme that schools them in the ways of adulthood, and Catherine Lacey\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jul/13/the-answers-catherine-lacey-review--sexual-relations-love-experiment#img-1\" title=\"\">The Answers</a></em>, in which a broke young woman opts to monetise herself by performing the role of a man\u2019s \u201cemotional girlfriend\u201d in a scientific experiment. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a674942c1f6f1171b6f77bb84515c9ed20d5f46d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a674942c1f6f1171b6f77bb84515c9ed20d5f46d/0_699_6144_3686/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Olivia Sudjic.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Olivia Sudjic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The crop of recent novels that have been termed \u201cmillennial\u201d depict a rootless, anxious life: a rat race whose illusory prize for sacrificing your soul is a bare minimum of social acceptance and financial security. Their protagonists tend to be navigating or avoiding adulthood, usually desperate, disenfranchised, displaced, ironic, full of rage or grim humour that covers unbearable shame and sadness. Rather than the violence and amorality described in a previous \u201cgeneration-defining\u201d book such as Ellis\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/02/evil-under-the-sun-the-dark-brilliance-of-bret-easton-ellis\" title=\"\"> </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/02/evil-under-the-sun-the-dark-brilliance-of-bret-easton-ellis\" title=\"\">Less Than Zero</a></em>, they tend toward self-sabotage or perform cheeriness under constant surveillance while slowly dying inside. And did I mention the humour?</p> <p>These may be the characteristics of the genre, but there is still no consensus on whether a \u201cmillennial novel\u201d is qualified by an author\u2019s age or that of its main protagonists, or even the age of the readers it is marketed to. I would argue that it is two things taken together: the age of the novelist (born between 1981 and 1996) and the novel\u2019s own mood and preoccupations \u2013 even when these are not set in the immediate present.</p> <p>Moshfegh, for example, born in 1981, just qualifies, though that does not mean all her novels should be pigeonholed as millennial. <em>My Year of Rest and Relaxation</em> is set before 9/11. The optimism of that time, with all its end-of-history narratives, now seems delusional, and the unnamed protagonist\u2019s coping strategy (a self-induced pharmaceutical coma inside the bubble of her apartment) fairly reasonable, though beyond the means of the millennials who come after her. It is this preoccupation with what Ellis might mock as safe spaces that permeates millennial novels for me. A longing for a place of security and stability that can insulate characters from, if not fix, their alienation. It is one thing to hate the world and want to change it, as many books that \u201cdefined\u201d previous generations did, but if you hate yourself, nowhere feels like home for very long; relief is found in certain physical places, memories, a person, a routine or mind-numbing substance. The need for these in millennial novels is always, at least in part, a response to the death throes of a ruthless economic system that makes us feel like outsiders to ourselves, a system propped up by ecocide, racism, sexism, the class system and heteronormativity. The longing is alleviated only by revulsion.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>All these novels explore alienation and longing alongside questions of\u00a0survival \u2013 the\u00a0mundane rather than the heroic kind</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In Rooney\u2019s work this combination of homesickness and alienation is located in the complex relationships between her protagonists \u2013 Frances and Bobbi, Connell and Marianne. In Sauma\u2019s <em>Everything You Ever Wanted</em>, it\u2019s in the pink oblivion of planet Nyx (which, ironically, comes to look like a screensaver) and subsequent nostalgia for Earth. In Carty-Williams\u2019s <em>Queenie</em>, it\u2019s in the memory of Queenie\u2019s grandmother\u2019s attic after her mother rejects her. In Butler\u2019s <em>The New Me</em> it is Millie\u2019s parents\u2019 home and their comforting infantilisation of her. In Ma\u2019s <em>Severance,</em> it\u2019s the familiarity of Candace\u2019s office, the zombies who return to the mall out of habit, and memories of China. In her recent debut <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/08/supper-club-lara-williams-review-cooking-storm\" title=\"\">Supper Club</a></em>, Lara Williams describes a group of hungry, disappointed women who meet in secret locations to commune, eat, drink, dance, throw up and take drugs in peace, while in <em>The Transition</em>, Kennard\u2019s protagonists take uneasy shelter in the home of their older mentors rather than go to prison.</p> <p>But there are also very specific ways in which this longing for refuge differs from book to book that have very little to do with being a millennial. Ma\u2019s Candace Chen keeps working at her job after the zombie apocalypse partly because she is the child of Asian immigrants. She has internalised a pressure to succeed, much as Carty-Williams\u2019s Queenie has internalised misogynoir and, as a Windrush descendant, the government\u2019s hostile environment policy. As a black woman she is also sexually objectified in the office, and in the marketplace of dating apps, made to feel subhuman and exploited. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7af5264e52bb02c3093f51eef2d687240717f0ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7af5264e52bb02c3093f51eef2d687240717f0ae/0_1530_4230_4168/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Candice Carty-Williams.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"985\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Candice Carty-Williams.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Often the preoccupation with home, exile and feeling lost is very literal. Moshfegh\u2019s orphaned protagonist describes wanting to hold on to her parents\u2019 house \u201cthe way you\u2019d hold on to a love letter. It was proof that I\u2019d not always been completely alone in this world.\u201d Thanks to the housing crisis and her racist-apologist ex who turfs her out, Carty-Williams\u2019s Queenie is obsessed with clean homes and must suffer through interminable flat-viewings with estate agents who proposition her. She uses humour as armour and, when she can no longer joke about it, decides to disappear, even from her closest friends, by moving in with her grandmother. \u201cI want to go home,\u201d Butler\u2019s protagonist Millie says. \u201cBut not to my apartment home, to my 13-years-ago home, to my hug-my-mother-home.\u201d It\u2019s a rare moment in which the mordant 30-year-old allows herself such sincerity. She describes previous attempts at home improvement as \u201ca lame attempt to assert some kind of femininity or mental stability\u201d. Ultimately one of Millie\u2019s few, fleeting sensations of real achievement comes from finally cleaning her apartment \u2013 not so much progress as stasis, the thankless task of keeping things as they are.</p> <p>All of the novels I\u2019ve listed (and there are, of course, many more) explore this alienation and longing alongside questions of survival \u2013 the mundane rather than heroic kind. They dignify the everyday struggles of their protagonists with deadpan humour, irony and reflections on their own privilege. Moshfegh describes a muted grief. Rooney\u2019s Frances endures undiagnosed endometriosis. The experience of Sauma\u2019s Iris \u2013 on another planet where human life can no longer be supported \u2013 consists more of (highly readable) boredom than terror. Ma\u2019s zombies are not particularly scary, while in Lacey\u2019s <em>The Answers</em>, Mary is struggling with a chronic yet banal mystery illness. The pain leaves her feeling as if \u201cthe use of my body, the only thing I really owned, had somehow been repossessed\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"36ae944f42854f0ee40c16a54d82a5dee94b7915\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36ae944f42854f0ee40c16a54d82a5dee94b7915/0_1_5179_3108/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Luke Kennard.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dystopian novel \u2026 Luke Kennard.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Billie Charity-Prescott</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s worth noting here that many of the novels being called millennial are written by women. Perhaps this reveals an inequality (male literary writers tend to be credited with writing universal books rather than category specific ones), or maybe it suggests these authors are attuned to the ways certain types of people suffer more under capitalism. Many of their female protagonists are overeducated, underpaid, childless, self-loathing, precarious, ironic, anxious and full of rage. They write lists and self-harm to bring some semblance of control. They are very perceptive, but either wilfully delude themselves, or their perceptions do not tally with their actions.

      "bodyText": "\u201cThere\u2019s no writing,\u201d Bret Easton Ellis declared recently of millennials. \u201cThey don\u2019t care about literature. None of them read books.\u201d Ellis asserted this during the publicity tour for his book White, a collection of essays about contemporary culture, presumably while his long-suffering millennial boyfriend Todd ripped through the latest Sally Rooney in the next room. Putting aside Ellis\u2019s claim not to know who Rooney is, it\u2019s predictable that literature should be yet another realm in which this generation is dismissed. The anointing of one book as a cultural touchstone, one individual as the oracle, and the fallacy of meritocracy that underpins it, is patently absurd. But as with every other millennial-bashing trope, so is the generalisation about our inability to produce one. As any digital marketeer with their crosshairs on millennials will tell you, the way we \u201cconsume\u201d culture has fragmented. Perhaps that\u2019s why Rooney hasn\u2019t appeared on Ellis\u2019s radar. Put in less depressing terms, we have a greater range of representative voices to choose from than in Ellis\u2019s decadent brat-pack days. The aim of publishing now should be to widen that range further. We don\u2019t need to coalesce and, contrary to what Ellis seems to think leviathans do for literary culture, the less we laud one as the template, the more space we open up for a greater number of new writers to write more books, more freely. In addition to this cultural fragmentation and welcome increase in diversity, the millennial mood is suspicious. We aren\u2019t desperate to lionise our writers, perhaps associating hyperbole with previous con jobs; the \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d rhetoric that led to 2007-2008\u2019s financial crisis, populist political movements, dodgy claims on the sides of buses and Fyre festival. A certain kind of millennial art can serve to bond certain kinds of millennials together in these uncertain times, but the spotlight on a Rooney or a Phoebe Waller-Bridge can reach an intensity that obscures everyone else (earlier this month, a book of scripts for the two series of Fleabag was subject to an eight-way auction and sold for a six-figure sum). It\u2019s not that the worlds of Rooney and Waller-Bridge aren\u2019t painfully true for a certain demographic, or that their creators don\u2019t deserve praise and recognition, but the idea that one writer or character can speak for so many in this fractured age seems delusional. Few of us who are actually millennials have taken the phrase \u201cvoice of a generation\u201d seriously since Hannah Horvath used it in Lena Dunham\u2019s Girls. I read Rooney\u2019s Conversations with Friends in a matter of hours in early June 2017, having heard little about it. The experience was uncanny and electric. If I had to pick my own \u201cgreat millennial novel\u201d it might well be that one, but I\u2019m a cis, white, middle class, metropolitan millennial woman who got a scholarship to a school where I met my own Bobbi, so it was easy to relate. In an Irish Times interview, Rooney says: \u201cI certainly never intended to speak for anyone other than myself. Even myself I find it difficult to speak for. My books may well fail as artistic endeavours but I don\u2019t want them to fail for failing to speak for a generation for which I never intended to speak in the first place.\u201d Elsewhere, she has expressed her disdain for literary celebrity. In Normal People, her male protagonist Connell, a fledgling writer, is alienated by a cohort who turn up to literary events for their rarefied atmosphere and the opportunity to perform culturedness. Rooney, a Marxist, is presumably sceptical of the designation \u201cgreat millennial novelist\u201d too, if only for how it will be used as a marketing strategy to commodify her writing. A \u201cgreat millennial novelist\u201d becomes a product, used to sell other products to other millennials. Such a label undermines the power of a book to speak across generations and to structures of power that govern both the publishing industry and the wider world it reflects. When my first novel, Sympathy, was published in 2017, one reviewer called it \u201cthe first great Instagram novel\u201d, which, as a marketing strapline, stuck. Some reviewers then dedicated themselves to proving or disproving the claim my own book hadn\u2019t made, which meant discussion of the book was often confined to social media addiction, ignoring surveillance, data capitalism and how such technology shapes our collective future. I was called on to make sweeping statements about my generation, when it seemed more pertinent to talk about the tyranny of algorithms and Cambridge Analytica. In contrast to the ways they are marketed and their media reception, millennial novels, if they have a common aim, push against labels, pedestals and the uncritical lauding of spokespeople. They care more about being relatable to a specific audience than a universal one. This resistance, bordering on impostor syndrome, is part of what makes them feel true to the millennials who read them. The protagonists of these novels eyeroll at marketing taglines, tired hierarchies, male canons and influencers. Self-definition is a millennial forte, but its novelists seem dubious of anything so earnest as defining a literary epoch. Their fictional worlds lambast our need for external validation and commodified selfhood of the kind that feeds late capitalism, even as they acknowledge their complicity and the impossibility of extrication. Some books deal with these themes through realism, as Rooney\u2019s do, alongside Joe Dunthorne\u2019s The Adulterants, in which a thirtysomething struggles with impending fatherhood, and Candice Carty-Williams\u2019s Queenie, whose eponymous heroine is evicted by her ex. There is a seam of very dark satire, as in Ottessa Moshfegh\u2019s My Year of Rest and Relaxation, whose nihilistic protagonist finds solace only in unconsciousness, and Halle Butler\u2019s The New Me, in which misanthropic Millie attempts to move from office temp to \u201cperm\u201d in the job she despises. An increasing number are more dystopian, such as Luiza Sauma\u2019s Everything You Ever Wanted, which sees millennial contestants on a reality show relocate to another planet, Ling Ma\u2019s zombie-apocalypse-meets-office-novel Severance, Luke Kennard\u2019s The Transition, about young people compelled to participate in a scheme that schools them in the ways of adulthood, and Catherine Lacey\u2019s The Answers, in which a broke young woman opts to monetise herself by performing the role of a man\u2019s \u201cemotional girlfriend\u201d in a scientific experiment. The crop of recent novels that have been termed \u201cmillennial\u201d depict a rootless, anxious life: a rat race whose illusory prize for sacrificing your soul is a bare minimum of social acceptance and financial security. Their protagonists tend to be navigating or avoiding adulthood, usually desperate, disenfranchised, displaced, ironic, full of rage or grim humour that covers unbearable shame and sadness. Rather than the violence and amorality described in a previous \u201cgeneration-defining\u201d book such as Ellis\u2019s Less Than Zero, they tend toward self-sabotage or perform cheeriness under constant surveillance while slowly dying inside. And did I mention the humour? These may be the characteristics of the genre, but there is still no consensus on whether a \u201cmillennial novel\u201d is qualified by an author\u2019s age or that of its main protagonists, or even the age of the readers it is marketed to. I would argue that it is two things taken together: the age of the novelist (born between 1981 and 1996) and the novel\u2019s own mood and preoccupations \u2013 even when these are not set in the immediate present. Moshfegh, for example, born in 1981, just qualifies, though that does not mean all her novels should be pigeonholed as millennial. My Year of Rest and Relaxation is set before 9/11. The optimism of that time, with all its end-of-history narratives, now seems delusional, and the unnamed protagonist\u2019s coping strategy (a self-induced pharmaceutical coma inside the bubble of her apartment) fairly reasonable, though beyond the means of the millennials who come after her. It is this preoccupation with what Ellis might mock as safe spaces that permeates millennial novels for me. A longing for a place of security and stability that can insulate characters from, if not fix, their alienation. It is one thing to hate the world and want to change it, as many books that \u201cdefined\u201d previous generations did, but if you hate yourself, nowhere feels like home for very long; relief is found in certain physical places, memories, a person, a routine or mind-numbing substance. The need for these in millennial novels is always, at least in part, a response to the death throes of a ruthless economic system that makes us feel like outsiders to ourselves, a system propped up by ecocide, racism, sexism, the class system and heteronormativity. The longing is alleviated only by revulsion. In Rooney\u2019s work this combination of homesickness and alienation is located in the complex relationships between her protagonists \u2013 Frances and Bobbi, Connell and Marianne. In Sauma\u2019s Everything You Ever Wanted, it\u2019s in the pink oblivion of planet Nyx (which, ironically, comes to look like a screensaver) and subsequent nostalgia for Earth. In Carty-Williams\u2019s Queenie, it\u2019s in the memory of Queenie\u2019s grandmother\u2019s attic after her mother rejects her. In Butler\u2019s The New Me it is Millie\u2019s parents\u2019 home and their comforting infantilisation of her. In Ma\u2019s Severance, it\u2019s the familiarity of Candace\u2019s office, the zombies who return to the mall out of habit, and memories of China. In her recent debut Supper Club, Lara Williams describes a group of hungry, disappointed women who meet in secret locations to commune, eat, drink, dance, throw up and take drugs in peace, while in The Transition, Kennard\u2019s protagonists take uneasy shelter in the home of their older mentors rather than go to prison. But there are also very specific ways in which this longing for refuge differs from book to book that have very little to do with being a millennial. Ma\u2019s Candace Chen keeps working at her job after the zombie apocalypse partly because she is the child of Asian immigrants. She has internalised a pressure to succeed, much as Carty-Williams\u2019s Queenie has internalised misogynoir and, as a Windrush descendant, the government\u2019s hostile environment policy. As a black woman she is also sexually objectified in the office, and in the marketplace of dating apps, made to feel subhuman and exploited. Often the preoccupation with home, exile and feeling lost is very literal. Moshfegh\u2019s orphaned protagonist describes wanting to hold on to her parents\u2019 house \u201cthe way you\u2019d hold on to a love letter. It was proof that I\u2019d not always been completely alone in this world.\u201d Thanks to the housing crisis and her racist-apologist ex who turfs her out, Carty-Williams\u2019s Queenie is obsessed with clean homes and must suffer through interminable flat-viewings with estate agents who proposition her. She uses humour as armour and, when she can no longer joke about it, decides to disappear, even from her closest friends, by moving in with her grandmother. \u201cI want to go home,\u201d Butler\u2019s protagonist Millie says. \u201cBut not to my apartment home, to my 13-years-ago home, to my hug-my-mother-home.\u201d It\u2019s a rare moment in which the mordant 30-year-old allows herself such sincerity. She describes previous attempts at home improvement as \u201ca lame attempt to assert some kind of femininity or mental stability\u201d. Ultimately one of Millie\u2019s few, fleeting sensations of real achievement comes from finally cleaning her apartment \u2013 not so much progress as stasis, the thankless task of keeping things as they are. All of the novels I\u2019ve listed (and there are, of course, many more) explore this alienation and longing alongside questions of survival \u2013 the mundane rather than heroic kind. They dignify the everyday struggles of their protagonists with deadpan humour, irony and reflections on their own privilege. Moshfegh describes a muted grief. Rooney\u2019s Frances endures undiagnosed endometriosis. The experience of Sauma\u2019s Iris \u2013 on another planet where human life can no longer be supported \u2013 consists more of (highly readable) boredom than terror. Ma\u2019s zombies are not particularly scary, while in Lacey\u2019s The Answers, Mary is struggling with a chronic yet banal mystery illness. The pain leaves her feeling as if \u201cthe use of my body, the only thing I really owned, had somehow been repossessed\u201d. It\u2019s worth noting here that many of the novels being called millennial are written by women. Perhaps this reveals an inequality (male literary writers tend to be credited with writing universal books rather than category specific ones), or maybe it suggests these authors are attuned to the ways certain types of people suffer more under capitalism. Many of their female protagonists are overeducated, underpaid, childless, self-loathing, precarious, ironic, anxious and full of rage. They write lists and self-harm to bring some semblance of control. They are very perceptive, but either wilfully delude themselves, or their perceptions do not tally with their actions. They alternate between self-destruction and doing what they need to survive. Even in Lila Savage\u2019s Say Say Say, which features the rare exception of a millennial female protagonist who does not hate herself, meaning is found not in the self or succeeding over others but in low-status care work. Repetitive, mundane tasks in the service and the home of another. The common project, which so much critical attention often misses, is not to describe a general condition of millennial womanhood, but to look at the broader structures and power dynamics that we are all part of. Any writer is a product of their age, just as any member of a generation is shaped by material conditions. As Jia Tolentino points out in her essay collection Trick Mirror, \u201ca generation doesn\u2019t start living a certain kind of rootless way, doing certain kind of flexible, temporary jobs, writing certain kinds of books, because of personality\u201d. In a recent interview about her novel Ma said: \u201cI\u2019m not an economist or a political theorist, but I wanted to capture what global capitalism feels like on the individual scale, down on the ground floor. I wanted to show the ambivalence of an employee working at a job that contributes to an unsustainable system, and yet who feels tethered to and even takes pleasure in her work routine.\u201d It\u2019s in this sense that I feel most comfortable talking about \u201cmillennial novels\u201d. Not in terms of the most successful individual writers, but those who, though they may not be household names, show us something compelling about the times in which they live and how certain social realities are constructed. Once you create a gold standard, other books start to sound derivative \u2013 everything now seems to be \u201cfor readers of Sally Rooney\u201d. There are only so many novelists who want to work that way to get past publishing\u2019s gatekeepers, rather than be read on their own terms. It can be interesting to think about cohorts, but categories tend to work against certain writers and not others. As Rebecca Liu wrote recently in her essay The Making of a Millennial Woman, there are only certain types of writers and female protagonists who are seen as relatable. Writing from the perspective of a working class person of colour rarely gets discussed in those terms.

For those further afield the terms of engagement will change. Once feted primarily for their anti-establishment bearings and intensely involved fan culture, Union Berlin rarely made significant headlines on the pitch before overcoming Stuttgart in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/28/union-berlin-reach-bundesliga-for-first-time-as-stuttgart-relegated\" title=\"\">a grippingly tense play-off</a> on 27 May. To some extent they liked it that way. But now things have got serious and the football itself is, more than ever, what gets people talking.</p> <p>\u201cIt has to be,\u201d says Michael Parensen, their longest-serving current player, who joined from K\u00f6ln when Union were a third-tier club in 2009, helping them to an instant promotion. \u201cIf it\u2019s not, then you won\u2019t achieve anything. In our first two or three years in 2 Bundesliga it was more: \u2018Yeah, it\u2019s nice to be here but we\u2019ll see what happens,\u2019 and that made it quite comfortable to play here. Then I think we reached a point where that was not enough; we needed to have more.</p> <p>\u201cThere were people who were happy to stay at that level but others said: \u2018No, we have to push on.\u2019 In the last few years the thought was in a lot more people\u2019s heads. For me this attitude can still change a little bit more because some people are like: \u2018Ah, I don\u2019t like to have all the stuff related to the top level, let\u2019s stay where we are and do our own thing.\u2019 There was a change in mentality but for me it could still be bigger.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/14/bayern-munich-and-the-problem-of-letting-hoeness-and-rummenigge-go\">Bayern Munich and the problem of letting Hoeness and Rummenigge go</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That is the tension Union must now master: establishing themselves as a strident Bundesliga outfit without sacrificing what, even by German standards, is a unique atmosphere at the altar of mammon. It is one reason Parensen, now 33 and a bit-part player, agreed to sign a new contract despite knowing he will feature irregularly.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be important for the supporters to see that not much is different,\u201d he says. \u201cI think I can be a point where they see: \u2018OK, the club is not changing at all.\u2019 My main role is to keep up the atmosphere in the locker room, as one of the most important factors in our success last year was the supportive environment.\u201d</p> <p>You have to be a specific kind of person to play for Union, he thinks, and newcomers have not always got up to speed. \u201cSome things are quite different here. You have to give more of your own to help the club, or help other players; you put your own effort in to get things done. It\u2019s quite special and some players have come in and had problems with the work ethic.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"804624dce2c373a8aee32b27cf82c35641f2576c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/804624dce2c373a8aee32b27cf82c35641f2576c/0_0_3840_5760/667.jpg\" alt=\"Micheal Parensen at Stadion An der Alten F\u00f6rsterei.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Micheal Parensen at Stadion An der Alten F\u00f6rsterei.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karsten Thielker/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They never lasted long. In his first few months at Union Parensen saw the extent to which everyone mucks in. Headlines were made globally when, in order to meet requirements for a third-tier licence, more than 2,300 supporters took it on themselves to help rebuild a dilapidated stadium. Christian Arbeit, the club\u2019s long-serving PA announcer and press officer, remembers 7am starts and the sight of six professional builders looking to put together teams that would work on specific sections. \u201cThey\u2019d ask the professions of their team: \u2018Teacher, nurse, car salesman, cinema guy\u2026\u2019\u201d he says, but the job was done and, whether or not by coincidence, that was the season Union\u2019s rise kicked on.</p> <p>It is a well-told story, just like the time in 2004 when the \u201cBleed for Union\u201d campaign saw fans give blood to raise money and avert bankruptcy. For Union, struggle always tended to be a fact of life; one that stemmed from fighting the GDR\u2019s status quo and never really went away. Ralf Zimmermann sits opposite Smolka and his cousin, Stefan, in Abseitsfalle and remembers the days in the 1980s when Union, playing against Dynamo, the Stasi favourites, in East Germany\u2019s top flight, knew they could never win.</p> <p>\u201cIt was like in a horse race where you have one great horse and an old one, and you can hand over your money beforehand,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen we sang together in those games we felt strong. Even if you were afraid, you\u2019d sing more and more, despite the fact there was a lot of hate in the songs and they had people in the crowd. We knew the Stasi guys from their clothes. Sometimes they pulled people out of the stadium and interrogated them; I knew people who ended up in prison.\u201d</p> <p>The stadium was a transgressive space; one that intoxicated a young and unworldly Arbeit, too. \u201cI was fascinated by the wildness and kind of freedom,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d never seen adults singing and shouting in public. When we had a free-kick and the opponent formed a wall we\u2019d cry: \u2018The wall must come down!\u2019 I\u2019d stand there as a little kid and think: \u2018What, no police coming?\u2019\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/16/southampton-ralph-hasenhuttl-day-off-cancelled-liverpool\">Day off cancelled and individual meetings \u2013 how Hasenh\u00fcttl has prepared for Liverpool</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That sense of defiance hung by a thread through the immediate post-reunification days when Union, the state apron strings cut and with no money-making nous whatsoever, sank to the fourth tier and had to grub around in front of 800 fans on weekend mornings. \u201cI was really afraid things would collapse at that point,\u201d Zimmermann says. But Union rose again. The fervour inside the stadium \u2013 fierce, constant, unstintingly optimistic and dizzyingly close for unsuspecting opposition players \u2013 has never really been diluted and the imperative now is to make sure the Bundesliga\u2019s bright lights do not turn a cult destination into a tourist trap.</p> <p>Zimmermann\u2019s childhood dream was for Stadion An der Alten Forsterei, three of whose stands are still given over to old-fashioned terracing, to resemble Anfield; an ambition that may not look unrealistic when, as planned, the 22,000-capacity stadium upgrades to 37,000. But that brings risks: atmospheres themselves are ripe for monetising and, even on the Kop, camera phones and selfie sticks are inescapable. Smolka points out that, if anyone in the Waldseite is spotted making over-eager use of a phone or recording device, they are politely shown another part of the stadium from which to deploy it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--showcase\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=Sport&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F300bbe40f5b09bad07e4d29f7f9b4c7e0e35f5d3%3Fcrop%3D0_241_3840_5341&amp;left-caption=A%20young%20fan%20shows%20his%20team%20wallet.&amp;right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Fc8e66fb94bb6422c04b7b3a34520a91d17de0175%3Fcrop%3D0_0_5552_3701&amp;right-caption=An%20older%20fan%20displays%20his%20Union%20Berlin%20tattoo.%20&amp;always-place-captions-below=false\" data-alt=\"Union Berlin fans\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=Sport&opinion-tint=false&left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F300bbe40f5b09bad07e4d29f7f9b4c7e0e35f5d3%3Fcrop%3D0_241_3840_5341&left-caption=A%20young%20fan%20shows%20his%20team%20wallet.&right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Fc8e66fb94bb6422c04b7b3a34520a91d17de0175%3Fcrop%3D0_0_5552_3701&right-caption=An%20older%20fan%20displays%20his%20Union%20Berlin%20tattoo.%20&always-place-captions-below=false\">Union Berlin fans</a> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"76c1750ea849c38a70307a268fb17d3d88439aaa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76c1750ea849c38a70307a268fb17d3d88439aaa/0_0_5530_3687/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fans take their picture with the club mascot \u201cRitter Keule\u201d.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fans take their picture with the club mascot \u201cRitter Keule\u201d.

While there is no pretence that a slick commercial operation does not exist to maximise revenues away from the pitch, what Arbeit describes as \u201cour holy 90 minutes\u201d will remain untouched by advertisements and promotions, while ticket prices have been frozen. \u201cOur message to the fans has been: \u2018If you don\u2019t change, we won\u2019t either; if you trust in us, we trust in you,\u2019\u201d Arbeit says, echoing a promise made by the club\u2019s president, Dirk Zingler, after their ascent. It is, on the face of things, a remarkable contract; its effectiveness will be tested fully if on-field success and rising interest \u2013 9,000 new members have signed up to the club since March \u2013 continue apace.</p> <p>They might do if Urs Fischer, who has transformed their fortunes since taking over as head coach in 2018, continues to work his magic. \u201cHe makes everyone in the team feel important,\u201d Parensen says. Fischer gathered his squad last winter and asked whether they felt a new striker was required; it is a fittingly collaborative approach, although he has sought to give them a fighting chance this season by signing some players with proven Bundesliga experience, such as Neven Subotic and Christian Gentner, this summer.</p> <p>The mere thought of walking out against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/08/why-rb-leipzig-has-become-the-most-hated-club-in-german-football\" title=\"\">RB Leipzig</a> \u2013 the club brought into existence in 2009 by the makers of Red Bull \u2013 gives Parensen visible goosebumps. He has waited a long time but on this occasion it may take a while for the atmosphere to warm up. \u201cNone of us wanted Leipzig in our first game, and then look what happened,\u201d Smolka says. He, Zimmermann and the rest of their supporters\u2019 group, FC Schluckauf 82, will join everyone else in remaining silent for the first 15 minutes, in protest against opponents whose origins could hardly differ more starkly from their own. \u201cThe fans have the club on their side,\u201d Zingler said this week.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"63077f60a939c5f5b5cc66be3b07b5fd8a87e28b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63077f60a939c5f5b5cc66be3b07b5fd8a87e28b/0_77_4570_2970/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Neben Subotic, left, and Christian Gentner, centre, during a training session.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"650\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Neben Subotic, left, and Christian Gentner, centre, during a training session.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karsten Thielker/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They will reinforce their own history in the process. The \u201cfinally there\u201d march will see supporters carry banners bearing photographs of dead, Union-supporting relatives to the ground on Sunday. Zimmermann would have loved to symbolically show his late brother, who introduced him to the club as a 12-year-old in 1972, what is going on but explains he later became a Hertha fan. \u201cHe did not go through all the suffering I went through,\u201d he says. At Union ideals and identity come with no middle ground.</p> <p>\u201cThere is still east and west [Berlin],\u201d Zimmermann says. \u201cThe heart of the East German football fan lies here. We want to emerge from our \u2018sleeping beauty\u2019 status. Hertha had a banner saying \u2018the capital\u2019s club\u2019 but you will never see that here.\u201d</p> <p>In reality Union stress anybody who admires the club\u2019s values and wants to offer active support is very welcome. But there will be no attempt to water down and represent an entire city. Those splashes of blue graffiti may yet become a regular hindrance. \u201cYou cannot deny history; the city has developed in different ways,\u201d Arbeit says. \u201cWe don\u2019t behave like everyone\u2019s darlings.\u201d</p>",

Once feted primarily for their anti-establishment bearings and intensely involved fan culture, Union Berlin rarely made significant headlines on the pitch before overcoming Stuttgart in a grippingly tense play-off on 27 May. To some extent they liked it that way. But now things have got serious and the football itself is, more than ever, what gets people talking. \u201cIt has to be,\u201d says Michael Parensen, their longest-serving current player, who joined from K\u00f6ln when Union were a third-tier club in 2009, helping them to an instant promotion. \u201cIf it\u2019s not, then you won\u2019t achieve anything. In our first two or three years in 2 Bundesliga it was more: \u2018Yeah, it\u2019s nice to be here but we\u2019ll see what happens,\u2019 and that made it quite comfortable to play here. Then I think we reached a point where that was not enough; we needed to have more. \u201cThere were people who were happy to stay at that level but others said: \u2018No, we have to push on.\u2019 In the last few years the thought was in a lot more people\u2019s heads. For me this attitude can still change a little bit more because some people are like: \u2018Ah, I don\u2019t like to have all the stuff related to the top level, let\u2019s stay where we are and do our own thing.\u2019 There was a change in mentality but for me it could still be bigger.\u201d That is the tension Union must now master: establishing themselves as a strident Bundesliga outfit without sacrificing what, even by German standards, is a unique atmosphere at the altar of mammon. It is one reason Parensen, now 33 and a bit-part player, agreed to sign a new contract despite knowing he will feature irregularly. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be important for the supporters to see that not much is different,\u201d he says. \u201cI think I can be a point where they see: \u2018OK, the club is not changing at all.\u2019 My main role is to keep up the atmosphere in the locker room, as one of the most important factors in our success last year was the supportive environment.\u201d You have to be a specific kind of person to play for Union, he thinks, and newcomers have not always got up to speed. \u201cSome things are quite different here. You have to give more of your own to help the club, or help other players; you put your own effort in to get things done. It\u2019s quite special and some players have come in and had problems with the work ethic.\u201d They never lasted long. In his first few months at Union Parensen saw the extent to which everyone mucks in. Headlines were made globally when, in order to meet requirements for a third-tier licence, more than 2,300 supporters took it on themselves to help rebuild a dilapidated stadium. Christian Arbeit, the club\u2019s long-serving PA announcer and press officer, remembers 7am starts and the sight of six professional builders looking to put together teams that would work on specific sections. \u201cThey\u2019d ask the professions of their team: \u2018Teacher, nurse, car salesman, cinema guy\u2026\u2019\u201d he says, but the job was done and, whether or not by coincidence, that was the season Union\u2019s rise kicked on. It is a well-told story, just like the time in 2004 when the \u201cBleed for Union\u201d campaign saw fans give blood to raise money and avert bankruptcy. For Union, struggle always tended to be a fact of life; one that stemmed from fighting the GDR\u2019s status quo and never really went away. Ralf Zimmermann sits opposite Smolka and his cousin, Stefan, in Abseitsfalle and remembers the days in the 1980s when Union, playing against Dynamo, the Stasi favourites, in East Germany\u2019s top flight, knew they could never win. \u201cIt was like in a horse race where you have one great horse and an old one, and you can hand over your money beforehand,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen we sang together in those games we felt strong. Even if you were afraid, you\u2019d sing more and more, despite the fact there was a lot of hate in the songs and they had people in the crowd. We knew the Stasi guys from their clothes. Sometimes they pulled people out of the stadium and interrogated them; I knew people who ended up in prison.\u201d The stadium was a transgressive space; one that intoxicated a young and unworldly Arbeit, too. \u201cI was fascinated by the wildness and kind of freedom,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d never seen adults singing and shouting in public. When we had a free-kick and the opponent formed a wall we\u2019d cry: \u2018The wall must come down!\u2019 I\u2019d stand there as a little kid and think: \u2018What, no police coming?\u2019\u201d That sense of defiance hung by a thread through the immediate post-reunification days when Union, the state apron strings cut and with no money-making nous whatsoever, sank to the fourth tier and had to grub around in front of 800 fans on weekend mornings. \u201cI was really afraid things would collapse at that point,\u201d Zimmermann says. But Union rose again. The fervour inside the stadium \u2013 fierce, constant, unstintingly optimistic and dizzyingly close for unsuspecting opposition players \u2013 has never really been diluted and the imperative now is to make sure the Bundesliga\u2019s bright lights do not turn a cult destination into a tourist trap. Zimmermann\u2019s childhood dream was for Stadion An der Alten Forsterei, three of whose stands are still given over to old-fashioned terracing, to resemble Anfield; an ambition that may not look unrealistic when, as planned, the 22,000-capacity stadium upgrades to 37,000. But that brings risks: atmospheres themselves are ripe for monetising and, even on the Kop, camera phones and selfie sticks are inescapable. Smolka points out that, if anyone in the Waldseite is spotted making over-eager use of a phone or recording device, they are politely shown another part of the stadium from which to deploy it. Union\u2019s supporters are used to self-policing and the club has promised to do its best elsewhere. While there is no pretence that a slick commercial operation does not exist to maximise revenues away from the pitch, what Arbeit describes as \u201cour holy 90 minutes\u201d will remain untouched by advertisements and promotions, while ticket prices have been frozen. \u201cOur message to the fans has been: \u2018If you don\u2019t change, we won\u2019t either; if you trust in us, we trust in you,\u2019\u201d Arbeit says, echoing a promise made by the club\u2019s president, Dirk Zingler, after their ascent. It is, on the face of things, a remarkable contract; its effectiveness will be tested fully if on-field success and rising interest \u2013 9,000 new members have signed up to the club since March \u2013 continue apace. They might do if Urs Fischer, who has transformed their fortunes since taking over as head coach in 2018, continues to work his magic. \u201cHe makes everyone in the team feel important,\u201d Parensen says. Fischer gathered his squad last winter and asked whether they felt a new striker was required; it is a fittingly collaborative approach, although he has sought to give them a fighting chance this season by signing some players with proven Bundesliga experience, such as Neven Subotic and Christian Gentner, this summer. The mere thought of walking out against RB Leipzig \u2013 the club brought into existence in 2009 by the makers of Red Bull \u2013 gives Parensen visible goosebumps. He has waited a long time but on this occasion it may take a while for the atmosphere to warm up. \u201cNone of us wanted Leipzig in our first game, and then look what happened,\u201d Smolka says. He, Zimmermann and the rest of their supporters\u2019 group, FC Schluckauf 82, will join everyone else in remaining silent for the first 15 minutes, in protest against opponents whose origins could hardly differ more starkly from their own. \u201cThe fans have the club on their side,\u201d Zingler said this week. They will reinforce their own history in the process. The \u201cfinally there\u201d march will see supporters carry banners bearing photographs of dead, Union-supporting relatives to the ground on Sunday. Zimmermann would have loved to symbolically show his late brother, who introduced him to the club as a 12-year-old in 1972, what is going on but explains he later became a Hertha fan. \u201cHe did not go through all the suffering I went through,\u201d he says. At Union ideals and identity come with no middle ground. \u201cThere is still east and west [Berlin],\u201d Zimmermann says. \u201cThe heart of the East German football fan lies here. We want to emerge from our \u2018sleeping beauty\u2019 status. Hertha had a banner saying \u2018the capital\u2019s club\u2019 but you will never see that here.\u201d In reality Union stress anybody who admires the club\u2019s values and wants to offer active support is very welcome. But there will be no attempt to water down and represent an entire city. Those splashes of blue graffiti may yet become a regular hindrance. \u201cYou cannot deny history; the city has developed in different ways,\u201d Arbeit says. \u201cWe don\u2019t behave like everyone\u2019s darlings.\u201d",

I swore at an idiot in the street who kerb\u2011crawled me last Friday. Man, he picked the wrong woman there. I swear at the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses who are determined to \u201cwitness\u201d me twice-weekly. I read that many of us swearing women end up on antidepressants rather than HRT, except that the former doesn\u2019t work and the latter does very well, but comes with an increased risk of cancer \u2013 though how increased is subject to intense global debate. I read that there\u2019s no point in contraception, not at this stage \u2013 it could cause blood clots or worse \u2013 but, also at the same time you must never stop contraception or you\u2019ll end up like Cherie Blair, who was too embarrassed to take it to Balmoral and gave birth at 45. I read that it\u2019s time to lie down more, but also that it\u2019s vital to keep moving \u2013 and why are you not weight training? I read that the trick is to drink gallons of water, take black cohosh \u2013 no, none of those, in fact the trick is to ignore it. I read all these things, but I don\u2019t discuss them with my friends, because, as I say, I am perfectly fine down there. I\u2019m very much menstrual, darling! If women do begin \u201cdelaying\u201d menopause \u2013 the new procedure involves snipping off bits of ovarian tissue, freezing cells and then reinserting them \u2013 it will not be for fertility purposes, but to avoid this tedious, draining, open-ended confusion. These women will be saying no to those years between 38 and 60, when nothing and everything might be about your grumbling womb. They will be opting out of the Googling, the puzzling and the now-outdated sense that stopping bleeding marks the twilight of life. They will swerve the idea that no longer producing eggs must mark the beginning of the floaty-shawled life-stage where one sits around in a smock dress with a beetle brooch and a Mallen streak, waiting for death. Very few sane women actually want to begin popping out babies at 50 years old, but millions of others would opt for a little lunchtime procedure so they can get on with research projects, book\u2011writing, owning businesses, living and laughing and being. So thank you anyway, Meg Mathews \u2013 for now, we\u2019re still in the weeds with this thing, but with your fanjo chat, you have gained one more, rather hormonal, fan.",

      "bodyText": "Well, that was a thoroughly entertaining afternoon of sport. The Black Ferns cemented their status as completely awesome, Collingwood enjoyed a powerful and poignant win over the Swifts in Super Netball, the Knights had a day out against the Cowboys in the NRL ... but best on ground goes to the Brisbane Lions. They showed the heart of a, um, Lion in coming from behind to overcome Geelong in a nailbiting top-of-the-table AFL clash at the Gabba, and advertise their wares as legitimate title contenders. I\u2019ve had an absolute blast and you\u2019ve all been splendid. But all good things must come to an end. And who am I to hog centre stage when Richard Parkin is doing his level best to bring you all things Bledisloe Cup? AFL: HT: Adelaide 2.6 (18) vs Collingwood 5.5 (35) - with a top-four berth still at stake, Collingwood produce an impressive first half against an impotent-looking Crows side. It took a late Darcy Fogarty goal to reduce the deficit to 17 points, but the Magpies are winning most battles and will head to the long break on good terms with themselves. The Magpies lead from start to finish, knocking over the ladder leaders in a win that sees them break into the top four. Collingwood shot an an imperious 94%, with Shimona Nelson netting 52 times from 54 attempts. And for those of you who like this sort of thing, both teams scored identically in each half - the Magpies registering 32 and 32, the Swifts 28 and 28. Small things and small minds, eh? Seems the Cowboys missed the half-time memo about an NRL game happening this afternoon in which they are supposed to be partaking. In modern sporting vernacular, they just didn\u2019t turn up. The Knights players were queuing up to cross that line, with tries to Kalyn Ponga (2), Mitchell Pearce (2), Mitchell Barnett, Sione Mata\u2019utia and Mason Lino making for a day in the sun for Newcastle. For good measure, Lino had a perfect kicking day with seven conversions out of seven attempts. Remarkable. Utterly remarkable. Three goals down after Patrick Dangerfield\u2019s rousing six-pointer, the Lions showed immense heart, and buckets of quality, to steal a one-point win - their ninth in a row. It\u2019s their first win over Geelong since 2013 and they now sit atop the AFL ladder for the first time since Mitch Robinson\u2019s skin was sans ink. Blockbusters, whatever they are, don\u2019t always live up to the billing but this one certainly did. Charlie Cameron was amazing with five goals and must now be rated the best small forward in the game. The Lions even had their highlight moment courtesy of Lincoln McCarthy\u2019s hanger and goal. Can Brisbane win the flag? They sure can. AFL: Q4, 1 min remaining: Brisbane 10.15 (75) vs Geelong 10.13 (73) - what nail? What coffin? Charlie Cameron and Lincoln McCarthy convert to give the Lions the lead and set up a grandstand finish. Not quite the massacre of the first Test but a Black Ferns win all the same, their 19th straight over the Wallaroos. Still, this was an improved performance from Australia. Have a read of Jill Scanlon\u2019s match report: Super Netball: 3QT: Magpies 48-42 Swifts - another impressive quarter from the Magpies sees their lead pushed out to six goals. AFL: Q4, 9 mins remaining: Brisbane 7.13 (55) vs Geelong 10.13 (73) - ouch. That has got to hurt. The Lions are battling away manfully but the Cats are going inside-50 at will ... and Patrick Dangerfield has just hammered one nail in the coffin with a 70m bomb that pushes Geelong\u2019s lead to three straight kicks. Carlton finish all over the top of St Kilda to register another victory - their sixth under the now rubber-stamped senior coach David Teague - and do the right thing by Dale Thomas in his last game at the MCG. After the game, Blues skipper Patrick Cripps described his revitalised club as the sleeping giant of the AFL. They\u2019ve done well since parting ways with Brendon Bolton, but can they emerge from this honeymoon period to challenge for the finals in 2020? I have my doubts. AFL: 3QT: Brisbane 6.12 (48) vs Geelong 8.9 (57) - these young Lions just won\u2019t go away. Undermanned - Allen Christensen is done for the day, while Mitch Robinson and Darcy Gardiner have taken knocks - but unbowed, the Lions are still in it. Charlie Cameron was again fantastic in the third quarter and is the top goal kicker with three. Super Netball: HT: Magpies 32-28 Swifts - the Magpies preserve their four-goal quarter-time buffer to take the same lead into the long break. The Magpies players are wearing black armbands in honour of coach Rob Wright\u2019s mum, who died yesterday. Thoughts and best wishes to the Wright family. Women\u2019s Rugby, 2nd Test: HT: Black Ferns 17-8 Wallaroos - a positive end to the half sees Lori Cramer kick truly after a questionable refereeing decision penalises the Black Ferns for a ruck infringement. Cramer\u2019s goal cuts the deficit to nine points, giving the visitors hope and a degree of confidence heading into the second half. NRL: HT: Knights 18-0 Cowboys - the half ends as it began at McDonald Jones Stadium with the Knights Mc-feasting on a lacklustre Cowboys unit. Mitchell Pearce\u2019s try after seven minutes was the succulent meat patty, burger-bunned by two cracking Kalyn Ponga tries. How far the Knights ... or can North Queensland make a game of this? AFL: 3QT: Carlton 7.10 (52) vs St Kilda 8.8 (56) - a see-sawing quarter and if not for inaccuracy in front of the big sticks, and a controversial umpiring decision, the Blues would be in front. Super Netball: QT: Magpies 17-13 Swifts - a bright start from Collingwood sees them take a lead into the first break. More of the same will be needed if the Magpies are to topple the ladder leaders and maintain their push for the finals. Women\u2019s Rugby, 2nd Test: 31 mins: Black Ferns 17-5 Wallaroos - Australia looked to be in the game early on the back of a Mahalia Murphy try, but this Test now looks like heading the same way of the previous 18 between these teams - with all roads leading to a New Zealand victory. Antonius_Block 1h ago 01 ...1 v 2 battle it out in what could be a season-defining contest. I though the same when Port travelled to Kardinia Pk to break Geelong\u2019s 15 wk winning streak in the penultimate rd of 2007. The season defining game proved to the GF, for quite a few seasons as it turned out for Port Adelaide. Good point, Antonius Block. I remember that game well. Dom Cassisi kicked the winning goal, unless I\u2019m mistaken. Yes, the season didn\u2019t end well for Port in 2007. AFL: HT: Brisbane 4.8 (32) vs Geelong 7.7 (49) - a very entertaining half of footy at the Gabba. The two teams traded blows in equal measures for the most part but Geelong showed their gears, and their class, to kick away late in the quarter. Gryan Miers is proving a potent scoring threat and Mark Blicavs is proving influential in the middle of the ground. Zac Bailey missed a set shot at the death in what would have been a welcome goal for the Lions, but they are far from out of this game. They will, however, need to address Geelong\u2019s midfield dominance. NRL: 11 mins: Knights 12-0 Cowboys - seems the Cowboys missed the memo about an NRL game happening this afternoon in which they are supposed to be partaking. Tries to Kalyn Ponga and Mitchell Pearce inside the opening eight minutes has seen the home side shoot out to a double-digit lead. AFL: Q2, 6 mins remaining: Brisbane 3.6 (24) vs Geelong 4.5 (29) - the Spinal Tap heat-o-meter has been cranked up to 11 at the Gabba in what is an intense, high-pressure and physical encounter. All Australian-in waiting Charlie Cameron is proving quite a handful for Geelong\u2019s defenders but a close-range finish from Gryan Miers has restored the Cats\u2019 narrow buffer. AFL: HT: Carlton 5.5 (35) vs St Kilda 7.4 (46) - the Saints take a two-kick lead into the long break. I\u2019d love to regale you with detail after detail of this pulsating 13 v 16 epic, but my two eyes have been preoccupied with affairs at the Gabba. But by most accounts fans at the MCG are being treated to an entertaining game and that Carlton are unlucky not to be closer. No doubt this pearler from Ben Long late in the half didn\u2019t help their cause. DrRudi 27m ago 01 @scott_heinrich A long time since we\u2019ve seen you in these parts? Good calling today. Apropos the video above (which I must report as animal abuse) can a Crow beat a Magpie? I for one am hoping you lose any semblance of impartiality as you bring us that match later. Hello DrRudi, me old mucker. You are correct. It has been a while since I\u2019ve dirtied these screens, though I intend to be a regular annoyance from here on. Where have I been? In the words of Dusty Bun, I\u2019ve been busy trying to save the world from Russians and monsters. What can I say, it\u2019s a neverending story. As for the game at Adelaide Oval, I have ceased expecting much from the Crows but if they can\u2019t beat an out-of-form, depleted Collingwood at home, well, they don\u2019t deserve to play finals. And even if they do, they\u2019ll be making up the numbers. AFL: QT: Brisbane 1.3 (9) vs Geelong 2.2 (12) - an engrossing first quarter ends with misses at both ends of the ground courtesy of Eric Hipwood and Gary Ablett. Brisbane\u2019s intercept marking has been noteworthy (10 for the term) and it\u2019s clear this game will be fought on tight, physical grounds. It\u2019s brutal out there. Just ask Lachie Neale. Heard a lot about Graham \u2018Polly\u2019 Farmer but know very little about the trailblazing indigenous Aussie Rules footballer, who died this week aged 84? Well I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve popped in for a visit because I have just the yarn for you. AFL: QT: Carlton 2.4 (16) vs St Kilda 3.3 (21) - a fairly even first quarter at the MCG where very few favours were asked or given. But if you want to take something out of the first stanza, have a peep at this screamer from spring-heeled Blue Mitch McGovern. AFL: Q1, 12 mins remaining: Brisbane 1.1 (7) vs Geelong 2.0 (12) - play has commenced under glorious spring-like sunshine at the Gabba. The Cats started well with majors to Mitch Duncan and Jed Bews but the Lions have steadied with a goal to Hugh McCluggage. I think it\u2019s game on. And if any evidence was needed that the glory days have returned to the Gabba, here it is. It\u2019s been some time since the Gabba hosted the match of the round. Over a decade and a half, to be precise. But these Lions have been impressive this season, prompting followers of this great sport to hark back to the days when Jonathan Brown, Simon Black, Michael Voss, Jason Akermanis and co bestrode the AFL like giants. Almost as impressive as this magnificent read penned by Jonathan Horn. Happy Saturday, sports fans! Along with \u2018What is the meaning of life?\u2019, \u2018What is the sound of one hand clapping?\u2019 and \u2018What on earth is Donald Trump\u2019s hairdresser thinking?\u2019, the following can be added to the list of all-time great existential questions: \u2018Who would win in a fight between a lion and a cat?\u2019 Well, we\u2019re going to find out this afternoon courtesy of a ripping AFL fixture between Brisbane and Geelong.

      "bodyText": "In blustery conditions, the New Zealand Women again dished up a lesson in clinical, physical, focused rugby, defeating Australia 37-8 at Eden Park in Auckland on Saturday. But in contrast to last week\u2019s effort, despite the score, the women in gold did not give their opponents an easy run. From the outset, the Black Ferns looked to be on song, scoring the opening try within the first three minutes. But Mahalia Murphy hit back quickly for Australia, using her sevens skillset to fend off tackle attempts as she raced to the tryline. The difference from last week in the Wallaroos\u2019 performance was evident from the start despite the Kiwis getting the first score. The Wallaroos approached this second international against the Black Ferns knowing they had to up their game when they ran out onto the foreboding turf of the notorious Eden Park. For the Black Ferns, there were early discipline problems, with four penalties conceded in the first 16 minutes. But by the second half, that extra gear they are known for kicked in and the scoreboard ticked over. For the Wallaroos, their efforts at the breakdown were much improved with a week of reflection under their belt. For all their preparations and positive mindset leading into the first game, Australia had looked intimidated by the Kiwis and this is perhaps the biggest hurdle they had to overcome in the return game. Captain Grace Hamilton this week underlined the fact that the players knew they had what it took to push the Ferns all the way but, for all their preparation, did not take that out onto the field in Perth. Last week, possession \u2013 or the inability to retain it \u2013 was their Achilles heel. They struggled to get time with the ball in hand, and when they did, the Black Ferns created successful turnover opportunities at will \u2013 a situation the Aussies vowed to redress this week. They did. The Wallaroos have the capability to take the game to the Black Ferns. They have the skillset, the talent and the drive to achieve the feat which has been consistently put before them as their Everest. The Black Ferns, however, just have to turn up and do what they do best \u2013 that\u2019s their secret to success. So, the responsibility for the outcome of this game was laid at the feet of the Australians. It was about what they brought onto Eden Park and how they executed their game-plan \u2013 physically and mentally. And they met those expectations despite suffering another defeat. Acknowledging they have been the mistresses of their own demise, the Wallaroos know their path to success is in their own hands and they showed that today. The difference on the scoreboard came from the Black Ferns\u2019 ability to be rewarded for their territory successes, underlined by their pace and their power, sustained for a full 80 minutes. The Wallaroos, however, continue to forge their pathway in women\u2019s rugby and are definitely closing the gap on their nemesis; on Saturday they proved they have what it takes to start to challenge the status quo.",

Rapinoe \u2013 slight, sharp-eyed, perennially amused \u2013 is considering the past fortnight. \u201cHow long can we be drunk for?\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cTo go through such a high \u2013 there is obviously a comedown and nobody really has the time to decompress. I think everyone feels in this state of \u2018Yes, this is awesome.\u2019 But I\u2019m also struggling to get back to normal.\u201d</p> <p>The sense of unreality is particularly acute for Rapinoe, whose profile over the course of the tournament shot from mid-level sporting celebrity to something much bigger, thanks to, as she puts it with some understatement, \u201cone of those general cultural events that happen\u201d. This is a reference not only to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/27/megan-rapinoe-donald-trump-white-house\" title=\"\">her public spat with Donald Trump</a> \u2013 in a video recorded before the World Cup that went viral during the tournament, she said: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/8by8mag/status/1143595809910530048?lang=en\" title=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m not going to the fucking White House,\u201d</a> when asked whether she was looking forward to a victorious visit \u2013 but to her demeanour in general.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"1f2c823e65483f5dac1d0c797aebc81694771a1e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f2c823e65483f5dac1d0c797aebc81694771a1e/319_485_1082_2206/490.jpg\" alt=\"Megan Rapinoe in action for the US in 2006.\" width=\"490\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In action for the US in 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The US women\u2019s team are the most successful in the sport\u2019s history: they have won four World Cups, four Olympic gold medals and more than three-quarters of the matches they have played since their first, in 1985. (By contrast, the US men\u2019s team have not gone further than the quarter-finals of the World Cup since 1930, when they came third.) Yet the word most commonly used to describe Rapinoe in the past few weeks has been \u201cunapologetic\u201d, with its implication of propriety overturned. She is unapologetically gay, unapologetically political and, above all, unapologetically proud of herself and her teammates. Her habit of celebrating a goal with her chest out, arms thrown wide to milk the crowd, is a standard piece of burlesque in men\u2019s football. When undertaken by Rapinoe, though, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/13/megan-rapinoe-us-womens-football-performer-entertain-trump-piers-morgan\" title=\"\">it made headlines</a>.

After Rapinoe\u2019s caustic remark, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1143892326286266368\" title=\"\">he tweeted a series of rambling messages</a> that praised the team, while accusing her of disrespecting \u201cour Country, the White House [and] our Flag\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0ee9eb78e5569e9c4d60a9c0925623e336b34808\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ee9eb78e5569e9c4d60a9c0925623e336b34808/0_893_6600_6519/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Megan Rapinoe has won two World Cups and one Olympic gold with her national team. \u2018Clearly, I have some kind of big-moment gene\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"988\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rapinoe: \u2018Clearly, I have some kind of big-moment gene.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dylan Coulter/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous and absurd,\u201d she says, in the kind of unmeasured tone that has made her such a gratifying repudiator of the normalisation of Trump. \u201cPeople were like: \u2018That was so intense!\u2019 And I\u2019m like: \u2018Honestly, he\u2019s a fucking joke, so it wasn\u2019t intense, because this is ridiculous.\u2019\u201d Rapinoe\u2019s timeline blew up, but she says she doesn\u2019t read comments about her. \u201cI never have.

But actually I have the opposite [view of] authority \u2013 my sister and I both.\u201d Rapinoe\u2019s non-identical twin sister, Rachael, is a former professional footballer. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that we\u2019re anti-authority, but when there\u2019s a person who is abusing their power or manipulating people, whether it\u2019s a teacher when I was younger or Donald Trump now, there\u2019s nothing that fires me up and grinds my gears more. I was just like: \u2018No. That\u2019s not happening.\u2019\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I always said that if the England team would loosen up a bit, you might have some success</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One of the most delicious aspects of Rapinoe\u2019s fight with the president was watching him malfunction under the weight of his own contradictions. \u201cWe are everything he loves,\u201d says Rapinoe \u2013 sportspeople, winners, Team America \u2013 \u201cwith the exception that we\u2019re powerful, strong women.

She bursts out laughing. \u201cThat\u2019s because you guys are so unsuccessful at everything.\u201d Yeah, but we like losing, I point out. And we wear it so well. \u201cYeah,\u201d she says, still smiling. \u201cI always said that if you guys would loosen up a bit \u2013 let that asshole go a little \u2013 and actually have some enjoyment, you might have some success.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8f9e8fd12f7278a1aa13006e1225ce623dd20adf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f9e8fd12f7278a1aa13006e1225ce623dd20adf/16_15_571_656/435.jpg\" alt=\"Megan Rapinoe (bottom, centre) with her family.\" width=\"435\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rapinoe (bottom, centre) with her family. \u2018Both of my parents should be really progressive - I don\u2019t get that they\u2019re not.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Megan Rapinoe</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rapinoe, a veteran taker of penalty kicks, considers the lingering trauma to the English psyche of Gareth Southgate\u2019s missed penalty during England\u2019s semi-final against Germany in Euro 96. Southgate has long since redeemed himself, but, on some level, the country never recovered. \u201cNobody remembers the redemption,\u201d she says, in reference to the English talent for nursing an injury. \u201cWe\u2019ll let anybody back in for a second chance; you guys never forget the first fuck-up.\u201d</p> <p>It is hard to imagine Rapinoe bowing her head in shame under any circumstances, let alone on the football field. She metabolises failure with startling briskness. \u201cI just don\u2019t get too down,\u201d she says, with a theatrical twang. \u201cI\u2019ve lost a World Cup final in the dying moments,\u201d\u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/jul/18/japan-usa-womens-world-cup-final\" title=\"\">on penalties to Japan in 2011, having been 1-0 and then 2-1 up</a> \u2013 \u201chad <a href=\"https://www.teamusa.org/News/2019/June/10/How-The-Olympic-Soccer-Loss-To-Sweden-Began-A-New-Era-For-The-USWNT-Defense\" title=\"\">a terrible exit in the Rio Olympics</a>, lost two other finals in a row, and it\u2019s like: \u2018What are you going to do?

I don\u2019t overanalyse; I don\u2019t watch film [of matches] that much. Obviously, losing in 2011 hurt bad, because I felt that we shouldn\u2019t have. But Japan had an amazing story, too. I\u2019ve had so much success in my career; you always know a win is around the corner.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I think my dad voted for Trump. I\u2019ll say: 'How can you be proud of me, and watch Fox News do takedowns of me?'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This attitude is not just evidence-based, but also part of Rapinoe\u2019s nature: \u201cClearly, I have some kind of big-moment gene that\u2019s just natural; it has to be.\u201d It is a question of upbringing, too. Rapinoe and her sister were raised with their three siblings in Redding, California, a small, conservative, largely working-class city in the north of the state, where her dad runs a construction company and her mum is a waitress. Had Rapinoe\u2019s personality been slightly different, she might have had a tougher time growing up. (Her elder brother, Brian, who is Rapinoe\u2019s great friend and ally, has had a long struggle with drug addiction and <a href=\"https://www.espn.co.uk/football/fifa-womens-world-cup/story/3878587/why-megan-rapinoes-brother-brian-is-her-greatest-heartbreakand-hope\" title=\"\">been in and out of prison for most of his adult life</a>.)</p> <p>If Rapinoe has grit, it comes in no small part from observing her mother\u2019s example. Denise was the second eldest of eight kids, a child of alcoholics from a chaotic household. \u201cHer parents died when she was younger than I am, she raised her younger sister and she has family into drugs. She has an extreme mental fortitude and toughness about her, while wearing it all quite lightly.\u201d</p> <p>There was a short period in Rapinoe\u2019s teens when, contrary to every other stage of her life, she went through a phase of feeling unnerved. She wasn\u2019t an unpopular kid. In Californian high-school culture, to be good at sports is to be guaranteed a certain level of popularity; as well as excelling at football, Rapinoe was a track and basketball star. Nonetheless, there were years when she felt out of place. \u201cI was always really confident as a kid \u2013 had that sense of humour and lightness socially, but it did get awkward for a point. I didn\u2019t really know what was going on and I thought eventually I\u2019d come out of it. And then, once I realised I was gay, I was like, \u2018Oh! That\u2019s what it is!\u2019 And then I was ready to go.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4633b1bee53863721f1a7a0af911b55cc113ed1f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4633b1bee53863721f1a7a0af911b55cc113ed1f/0_269_3107_2280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Megan Rapinoe with her girlfriend, Sue Bird.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"734\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With her girlfriend, Sue Bird.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She came out while studying at the University of Portland in Oregon. It was entirely untraumatic. \u201cI didn\u2019t struggle to come out. I thought: \u2018Well, yeah, obviously, I\u2019m gay.\u2019 Everyone should have told me: it was just [obvious] for my whole childhood \u2013 hello?\u201d There was no period of adjustment and no expectation that her life would get harder. Instead, she revelled in finding herself outside of the mainstream. \u201cI thought: \u2018This is awesome \u2013 and if people aren\u2019t down with it I don\u2019t really care to have them in my life, anyway.\u2019 My parents said: \u2018What are people going to say?\u2019 and: \u2018We don\u2019t want things to be harder for you.\u2019 But I don\u2019t think I ever saw ways in which it was harder.\u201d</p> <p>By her early 20s, Rapinoe was well on her way to becoming a professional footballer. She had been playing for the national youth squad since her late teens and would be chosen for the national team while still at college. Her parents\u2019 anxiety about her sexuality just didn\u2019t figure. \u201cAt one point, my mom was telling all her work friends: \u2018Oh, my daughters\u2019 \u2013 because my sister is gay, too \u2013 \u2018Oh, the twins are gay, blah blah blah.\u2019 Meanwhile, their kids were dropping out of high school and having drug problems and doing all these crazy things, and they were like: \u2018You don\u2019t have any problems! All your kids are amazing, they\u2019re doing sport and getting their college paid for and doing great.\u2019\u201d She bursts out laughing.</p> <p>Good for you for not internalising these doubts, I say. \u201cOh, no! I was like: \u2018You guys need to get on board or get out.\u2019 We had some tense times, but it came down to, \u2018You\u2019re either in this or not.\u2019\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We need to talk about money. For men it\u2019s a mark of where you are. I have a\u00a0$35,000 Rolex \u2013 people are going to know</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Rapinoe\u2019s pushback was instinctive, but I wonder if her political engagement comes in part from conditioning. Was it a political household? \u201cNo, not at all. I feel like I grew up with all of these lessons [about equality], but nothing was ever spoken. No language was ever put around it. Both of my parents should be really progressive \u2013 especially my mom \u2013 and I don\u2019t get that they\u2019re not. I\u2019m always saying: \u2018You guys should really be Democrats!\u2019 But they\u2019re not, so what\u2019s happening?\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps Rapinoe is the expression of their sublimated liberalism, the things that her parents can\u2019t say, I suggest. \u201cI know. And I\u2019m very similar to how they are, even though I think my dad voted for Trump and I\u2019ll say: \u2018I don\u2019t get it. How are you simultaneously as proud as punch of me, and watching Fox News all the time, [who are doing] takedowns of your daughter?\u2019 That\u2019s why I\u2019m like: \u2018You guys need to go to therapy.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Do they fight now? \u201cThere\u2019s been some major blow-ups. There\u2019s definitely been some dust-ups.\u201d At the same time, she says: \u201cI\u2019m very close to my family. It\u2019s not like: \u2018Ugh, I\u2019m from a conservative town and I never talk to them any more.\u2019 I talk to my parents all the time, every day. And I feel like I have seen progress and growth. I would love it if people understood you should never say racist things and be OK with gay people, or whatever it is. But, obviously, it doesn\u2019t happen that quickly.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"855ec9e52dd77b7dd17997946b0982db94540bc3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/855ec9e52dd77b7dd17997946b0982db94540bc3/1090_315_814_1538/529.jpg\" alt=\"Megan Rapinoe at the 2019 Women\u2019s World Cup.\" width=\"529\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At the 2019 Women\u2019s World Cup.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was Brian who introduced Rapinoe to football. She took to it almost immediately. After debuting for the national team in 2006, her professional career started in 2009, when she signed with the Chicago Red Stars. Over the next 10 years, she moved between clubs in Philadelphia, Boca Raton in Florida, Sydney and Seattle, before signing with the French side Lyon \u2013 arguably the strongest team in women\u2019s football \u2013 in 2013. She returned to the US later that year to play for her current team, Reign, near Seattle.</p> <p>If Rapinoe loves the performance aspect of playing, she is careful not to rely too heavily on crowd approval for her sense of wellbeing. \u201cI really gain my energy from a very small and close-knit group of people \u2013 my mom, my twin sister, my best friends and Sue.\u201d Sue Bird, Rapinoe\u2019s girlfriend, is a WNBA basketball star and four-time Olympic champion whom Rapinoe met at the Rio Olympics. (The pair are a women\u2019s sport power duo and last year became the first same-sex couple to pose \u2013 nude \u2013 for ESPN\u2019s Body Issue.) \u201cOf course I like the attention. Who doesn\u2019t want 50,000 people going: \u2018You\u2019re awesome!\u2019 But, in the same sense, I\u2019m not a slave to it; it\u2019s not the reason I do or say those things.\u201d</p> <p>Theatrics on the pitch and what Rapinoe calls the \u201ctravelling circus\u201d are a commercial necessity in a game that is still making a case for itself against the backdrop of unequal investment from the US soccer authorities. Earlier this year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/mar/08/usa-womens-team-sues-us-soccer-pay-equality\" title=\"\">Rapinoe and her teammates filed a federal lawsuit against US Soccer</a>, the sport\u2019s governing body in the US, alleging \u201cinstitutionalised gender discrimination\u201d.</p> <p>The pay structures for the men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams in the US are different, resulting in the average female player earning vastly less at club level than her male counterparts, while only a fraction of what goes into the men\u2019s game is invested in women\u2019s football. On the day we meet, a statement has been released from Carlos Cordeiro, the president of US Soccer, fighting back against the lawsuit and pointing out that, between 2010 and 2018, \u201cUS Soccer has paid our women\u2019s national team more than our men\u2019s national team\u201d \u2013 $34.1m (\u00a328.1m) versus $26.4m. Furthermore, he added, the women receive benefits including healthcare, which the men don\u2019t.</p> <p>What does she make of Cordeiro\u2019s figures? \u201cWell, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re counting up every cent over 10 years,\u201d Rapinoe says, rolling her eyes. \u201cI would like to know what the potential of the men\u2019s contracts over the last 10 years would be compared with ours. We\u2019ve probably won 85% of our games over 10 years. And the men have clearly not. And [he says] we\u2019ve only been paid $8m more? We\u2019ve been to three World Cup finals and won two of them.

So what now? Rapinoe looks very dry. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m excited to go to mediation, I guess.\u201d</p> <p>Rapinoe wants to encourage women to talk more openly about money. She is startlingly honest on the subject. I notice her gold Rolex and ask if she bought it as a victory gift; she smiles and says: \u201cI did. I\u2019ve been very intentional about talking about money recently. I think money for men is a sign of: \u2018Oh, I\u2019m the best,\u2019 a marker of where you are in your sport. And for women everything is always kept secret \u2013 which I think only hurts us. I want to know what everyone else is making, and I\u2019ll tell you: \u2018I did this appearance for this amount of money; how much are you doing it for? How much are you getting paid by Nike?\u2019 It\u2019s a little bit awkward. But then even in my close friend group we\u2019ve started talking about it and it takes the weird stigma out of it. Now I\u2019m starting to make a lot more money, so I\u2019m starting to splash a little bit more. So I have a $35,000 Rolex \u2013 people are going to know that.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019re a little more relatable than actresses who make millions of dollars \u2013 not that that makes inequality any better</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She is very aware of how this can sound and is keen to emphasise that, when it comes to \u201cthis whole equal pay thing, we\u2019re not poor. We\u2019re making a lot of money every year, so we need to find a way to talk about it. I\u2019ve never had another job. I make at least half a million dollars a year. But that doesn\u2019t mean that what we\u2019re getting is equal.\u201d</p> <p>For Rapinoe, speaking out is simply the duty of everyone with a conscience. \u201cHow can you see all the shit that\u2019s happening and not say anything? Everyone has the responsibility to do their part \u2013 I just happen to be naturally very confident, and it seems that people listen to me.\u201d She smiles. \u201cI\u2019m kind of charming and I\u2019m famous. So this is the way that I have to do it.\u201d</p> <p>Her straightforwardness is a large part of why people call her obnoxious. In different hands, this tone can seem smug, self-righteous or self-serving; she has been accused of all three. But in person it comes across as a kind of guileless unwillingness to circumvent the truth. Even when she praises herself, it is with a levity that pokes fun at what one can and can\u2019t say.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"233e4abd422f89b1bc71d9bb999a422367252c38\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/233e4abd422f89b1bc71d9bb999a422367252c38/0_528_6600_7728/854.jpg\" alt=\"Megan Rapinoe.\" width=\"854\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rapinoe: \u2018The team have been a huge part of the fight for gay rights.

I feel like we can see the world changing around us and we\u2019re a huge part of that, effecting that change.\u201d Can she give an example? \u201cI feel like gay rights \u2013 we\u2019ve been a huge part of that. You\u2019re starting to see more players come out. There could be more \u2013 I mean, people are still being beat up for being gay. Part of it is just about talking about it all the time and starting to break down stereotypes. When I came out, people said: \u2018OK, you have short hair, we sort of get it.\u2019 But then with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/mar/13/uswnt-soccer-ali-krieger-ashlyn-harris-engaged\" title=\"\">Ashlyn [Harris] and Ali [Krieger] coming out</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.glamour.com/story/kelley-ohara-world-cup-photo\" title=\"\">Kelley [O\u2019Hara] kissing her girlfriend at the World Cup</a>, stuff like that, the younger ones don\u2019t even need to come out, they\u2019re just out. They always were. So that\u2019s been really cool.\u201d</p> <p>Rapinoe is very proud of the pay equity campaign, although she is realistic about why it has gained such traction. \u201cWe\u2019re part of a much larger movement, and we\u2019re a little more relatable than actresses who make millions of dollars \u2013 not that that makes [the inequality] any better.\u201d A bigger part of it, however, is that \u201ctraditionally, we\u2019re very cute and white. If you juxtapose [publicity given to Rapinoe and her teammates] with [the way in which] the Women\u2019s Basketball Association has been fighting for all these things \u2013 but they\u2019re gay and black and nobody wants to talk about that.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d5817eb4f2d97d68bb3303e9bee0f19b27950278\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5817eb4f2d97d68bb3303e9bee0f19b27950278/2006_264_1779_3100/574.jpg\" alt=\"Megan Rapinoe at the Women\u2019s World Cup in France this year.\" width=\"574\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At the Women\u2019s World Cup in France this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the end, it comes down to a question of space: the politics, the celebrations, the fight for equal pay \u2013 even the pink hair. The night before Rapinoe left with the team for the World Cup, she announced to her girlfriend that she was going to dye her hair pink, a last-minute decision that, if it backfired, left no time for recovery. Bird, who is more of a worrier than Rapinoe, urged caution. \u201cHer thing was: \u2018Is this really what you want to do the day before you\u2019re going to be on the biggest stage of your life?\u2019\u201d Rapinoe grins. \u201cI said: \u2018That\u2019s exactly why I want to do it.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Of course, it is not about the hair. Rapinoe understands the symbolism and she understands the stakes.<strong> </strong>\u201cI feel as if women are socialised not to take up space and men are. The team were called arrogant for our celebrations \u2013 for even planning a celebration and thinking we were going to win. Well, of course you think you\u2019re going to win \u2013 that\u2019s the whole point of the game.\u201d She looks incredulous. \u201cYou can be famous, and loud, and boisterous, and [stand] for good stuff, too, and do it all.

      "bodyText": "It is two weeks since the US women\u2019s football team shut down midtown Manhattan on their World Cup victory parade and Megan Rapinoe, the team\u2019s co-captain and most visible member, is still trying to come down from the high. We are in Los Angeles, where the US national team is due to play a friendly against Ireland. Rapinoe \u2013 slight, sharp-eyed, perennially amused \u2013 is considering the past fortnight. \u201cHow long can we be drunk for?\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cTo go through such a high \u2013 there is obviously a comedown and nobody really has the time to decompress. I think everyone feels in this state of \u2018Yes, this is awesome.\u2019 But I\u2019m also struggling to get back to normal.\u201d The sense of unreality is particularly acute for Rapinoe, whose profile over the course of the tournament shot from mid-level sporting celebrity to something much bigger, thanks to, as she puts it with some understatement, \u201cone of those general cultural events that happen\u201d. This is a reference not only to her public spat with Donald Trump \u2013 in a video recorded before the World Cup that went viral during the tournament, she said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to the fucking White House,\u201d when asked whether she was looking forward to a victorious visit \u2013 but to her demeanour in general. The US women\u2019s team are the most successful in the sport\u2019s history: they have won four World Cups, four Olympic gold medals and more than three-quarters of the matches they have played since their first, in 1985. (By contrast, the US men\u2019s team have not gone further than the quarter-finals of the World Cup since 1930, when they came third.) Yet the word most commonly used to describe Rapinoe in the past few weeks has been \u201cunapologetic\u201d, with its implication of propriety overturned. She is unapologetically gay, unapologetically political and, above all, unapologetically proud of herself and her teammates. Her habit of celebrating a goal with her chest out, arms thrown wide to milk the crowd, is a standard piece of burlesque in men\u2019s football. When undertaken by Rapinoe, though, it made headlines. At last month\u2019s victory parade, she kissed the trophy and yelled: \u201cI deserve this!\u201d and for a moment, conventions governing women\u2019s conduct in public seemed thrillingly, shockingly to change. The best thing about all this is that the 34-year-old, known to her fans as \u201cPinoe\u201d, refuses to agonise about any of it \u2013 not even being yelled at by Trump on Twitter appears to faze her. After Rapinoe\u2019s caustic remark, he tweeted a series of rambling messages that praised the team, while accusing her of disrespecting \u201cour Country, the White House [and] our Flag\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous and absurd,\u201d she says, in the kind of unmeasured tone that has made her such a gratifying repudiator of the normalisation of Trump. \u201cPeople were like: \u2018That was so intense!\u2019 And I\u2019m like: \u2018Honestly, he\u2019s a fucking joke, so it wasn\u2019t intense, because this is ridiculous.\u2019\u201d Rapinoe\u2019s timeline blew up, but she says she doesn\u2019t read comments about her. \u201cI never have. And I think I\u2019d been conditioned, from kneeling, to being used to the craziest shit happening in my Twitter feed.\u201d Rapinoe is referring to the time in 2016 when she kneeled during the national anthem before a match, a gesture inaugurated by the NFL star Colin Kaepernick in protest against police brutality towards African Americans. At the time, she wrote: \u201cI haven\u2019t experienced over-policing, racial profiling, police brutality or the sight of a family member\u2019s body lying dead in the street. But I cannot stand idly by while there are people in this country who have had to deal with that kind of heartache.\u201d The US Soccer Federation later amended its rules to require all players to \u201cstand respectfully\u201d during the anthem; Rapinoe did so at the World Cup, but, unlike her teammates, she didn\u2019t put her hand over her heart or sing along. Whatever your views of the president, to be yelled at online by the most powerful man in the world would represent to most people an alarming brush with authority. Wasn\u2019t there a tiny part of Rapinoe that thought: \u201cWhat have I done?\u201d \u201cThe only moment where I was like \u2018Aaaargh!\u2019 was when I thought: \u2018Is this going to affect the team in some way?\u2019 I didn\u2019t want that to happen. But actually I have the opposite [view of] authority \u2013 my sister and I both.\u201d Rapinoe\u2019s non-identical twin sister, Rachael, is a former professional footballer. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that we\u2019re anti-authority, but when there\u2019s a person who is abusing their power or manipulating people, whether it\u2019s a teacher when I was younger or Donald Trump now, there\u2019s nothing that fires me up and grinds my gears more. I was just like: \u2018No. That\u2019s not happening.\u2019\u201d One of the most delicious aspects of Rapinoe\u2019s fight with the president was watching him malfunction under the weight of his own contradictions. \u201cWe are everything he loves,\u201d says Rapinoe \u2013 sportspeople, winners, Team America \u2013 \u201cwith the exception that we\u2019re powerful, strong women. And he was having a really hard time \u2013 you could see in these sets of tweets: you hate us, you love us, you want us to come [to the White House] \u2013 and you are threatening us, all at the same time.\u201d In his response to Rapinoe, the president goaded her and the team with the suggestion that: \u201cMegan should WIN first before she TALKS!\u201d From the outside, this looked like intolerable pressure, particularly to English people who can\u2019t stand high stakes on the pitch. She bursts out laughing. \u201cThat\u2019s because you guys are so unsuccessful at everything.\u201d Yeah, but we like losing, I point out. And we wear it so well. \u201cYeah,\u201d she says, still smiling. \u201cI always said that if you guys would loosen up a bit \u2013 let that asshole go a little \u2013 and actually have some enjoyment, you might have some success.\u201d Rapinoe, a veteran taker of penalty kicks, considers the lingering trauma to the English psyche of Gareth Southgate\u2019s missed penalty during England\u2019s semi-final against Germany in Euro 96. Southgate has long since redeemed himself, but, on some level, the country never recovered. \u201cNobody remembers the redemption,\u201d she says, in reference to the English talent for nursing an injury. \u201cWe\u2019ll let anybody back in for a second chance; you guys never forget the first fuck-up.\u201d It is hard to imagine Rapinoe bowing her head in shame under any circumstances, let alone on the football field. She metabolises failure with startling briskness. \u201cI just don\u2019t get too down,\u201d she says, with a theatrical twang. \u201cI\u2019ve lost a World Cup final in the dying moments,\u201d\u2013 on penalties to Japan in 2011, having been 1-0 and then 2-1 up \u2013 \u201chad a terrible exit in the Rio Olympics, lost two other finals in a row, and it\u2019s like: \u2018What are you going to do? Wallow in it?\u2019 I\u2019m certainly not going to do that. I just get on with it. I tend to think that something better is coming. I don\u2019t overanalyse; I don\u2019t watch film [of matches] that much. Obviously, losing in 2011 hurt bad, because I felt that we shouldn\u2019t have. But Japan had an amazing story, too. I\u2019ve had so much success in my career; you always know a win is around the corner.\u201d This attitude is not just evidence-based, but also part of Rapinoe\u2019s nature: \u201cClearly, I have some kind of big-moment gene that\u2019s just natural; it has to be.\u201d It is a question of upbringing, too. Rapinoe and her sister were raised with their three siblings in Redding, California, a small, conservative, largely working-class city in the north of the state, where her dad runs a construction company and her mum is a waitress. Had Rapinoe\u2019s personality been slightly different, she might have had a tougher time growing up. (Her elder brother, Brian, who is Rapinoe\u2019s great friend and ally, has had a long struggle with drug addiction and been in and out of prison for most of his adult life.) If Rapinoe has grit, it comes in no small part from observing her mother\u2019s example. Denise was the second eldest of eight kids, a child of alcoholics from a chaotic household. \u201cHer parents died when she was younger than I am, she raised her younger sister and she has family into drugs. She has an extreme mental fortitude and toughness about her, while wearing it all quite lightly.\u201d There was a short period in Rapinoe\u2019s teens when, contrary to every other stage of her life, she went through a phase of feeling unnerved. She wasn\u2019t an unpopular kid. In Californian high-school culture, to be good at sports is to be guaranteed a certain level of popularity; as well as excelling at football, Rapinoe was a track and basketball star. Nonetheless, there were years when she felt out of place. \u201cI was always really confident as a kid \u2013 had that sense of humour and lightness socially, but it did get awkward for a point. I didn\u2019t really know what was going on and I thought eventually I\u2019d come out of it. And then, once I realised I was gay, I was like, \u2018Oh! That\u2019s what it is!\u2019 And then I was ready to go.\u201d She came out while studying at the University of Portland in Oregon. It was entirely untraumatic. \u201cI didn\u2019t struggle to come out. I thought: \u2018Well, yeah, obviously, I\u2019m gay.\u2019 Everyone should have told me: it was just [obvious] for my whole childhood \u2013 hello?\u201d There was no period of adjustment and no expectation that her life would get harder. Instead, she revelled in finding herself outside of the mainstream. \u201cI thought: \u2018This is awesome \u2013 and if people aren\u2019t down with it I don\u2019t really care to have them in my life, anyway.\u2019 My parents said: \u2018What are people going to say?\u2019 and: \u2018We don\u2019t want things to be harder for you.\u2019 But I don\u2019t think I ever saw ways in which it was harder.\u201d By her early 20s, Rapinoe was well on her way to becoming a professional footballer. She had been playing for the national youth squad since her late teens and would be chosen for the national team while still at college. Her parents\u2019 anxiety about her sexuality just didn\u2019t figure. \u201cAt one point, my mom was telling all her work friends: \u2018Oh, my daughters\u2019 \u2013 because my sister is gay, too \u2013 \u2018Oh, the twins are gay, blah blah blah.\u2019 Meanwhile, their kids were dropping out of high school and having drug problems and doing all these crazy things, and they were like: \u2018You don\u2019t have any problems! All your kids are amazing, they\u2019re doing sport and getting their college paid for and doing great.\u2019\u201d She bursts out laughing. Good for you for not internalising these doubts, I say. \u201cOh, no! I was like: \u2018You guys need to get on board or get out.\u2019 We had some tense times, but it came down to, \u2018You\u2019re either in this or not.\u2019\u201d Rapinoe\u2019s pushback was instinctive, but I wonder if her political engagement comes in part from conditioning. Was it a political household? \u201cNo, not at all. I feel like I grew up with all of these lessons [about equality], but nothing was ever spoken. No language was ever put around it. Both of my parents should be really progressive \u2013 especially my mom \u2013 and I don\u2019t get that they\u2019re not. I\u2019m always saying: \u2018You guys should really be Democrats!\u2019 But they\u2019re not, so what\u2019s happening?\u201d Perhaps Rapinoe is the expression of their sublimated liberalism, the things that her parents can\u2019t say, I suggest. \u201cI know. And I\u2019m very similar to how they are, even though I think my dad voted for Trump and I\u2019ll say: \u2018I don\u2019t get it. How are you simultaneously as proud as punch of me, and watching Fox News all the time, [who are doing] takedowns of your daughter?\u2019 That\u2019s why I\u2019m like: \u2018You guys need to go to therapy.\u2019\u201d Do they fight now? \u201cThere\u2019s been some major blow-ups. There\u2019s definitely been some dust-ups.\u201d At the same time, she says: \u201cI\u2019m very close to my family. It\u2019s not like: \u2018Ugh, I\u2019m from a conservative town and I never talk to them any more.\u2019 I talk to my parents all the time, every day. And I feel like I have seen progress and growth. I would love it if people understood you should never say racist things and be OK with gay people, or whatever it is. But, obviously, it doesn\u2019t happen that quickly.\u201d It was Brian who introduced Rapinoe to football. She took to it almost immediately. After debuting for the national team in 2006, her professional career started in 2009, when she signed with the Chicago Red Stars. Over the next 10 years, she moved between clubs in Philadelphia, Boca Raton in Florida, Sydney and Seattle, before signing with the French side Lyon \u2013 arguably the strongest team in women\u2019s football \u2013 in 2013. She returned to the US later that year to play for her current team, Reign, near Seattle. If Rapinoe loves the performance aspect of playing, she is careful not to rely too heavily on crowd approval for her sense of wellbeing. \u201cI really gain my energy from a very small and close-knit group of people \u2013 my mom, my twin sister, my best friends and Sue.\u201d Sue Bird, Rapinoe\u2019s girlfriend, is a WNBA basketball star and four-time Olympic champion whom Rapinoe met at the Rio Olympics. (The pair are a women\u2019s sport power duo and last year became the first same-sex couple to pose \u2013 nude \u2013 for ESPN\u2019s Body Issue.) \u201cOf course I like the attention. Who doesn\u2019t want 50,000 people going: \u2018You\u2019re awesome!\u2019 But, in the same sense, I\u2019m not a slave to it; it\u2019s not the reason I do or say those things.\u201d Theatrics on the pitch and what Rapinoe calls the \u201ctravelling circus\u201d are a commercial necessity in a game that is still making a case for itself against the backdrop of unequal investment from the US soccer authorities. Earlier this year, Rapinoe and her teammates filed a federal lawsuit against US Soccer, the sport\u2019s governing body in the US, alleging \u201cinstitutionalised gender discrimination\u201d. The pay structures for the men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams in the US are different, resulting in the average female player earning vastly less at club level than her male counterparts, while only a fraction of what goes into the men\u2019s game is invested in women\u2019s football. On the day we meet, a statement has been released from Carlos Cordeiro, the president of US Soccer, fighting back against the lawsuit and pointing out that, between 2010 and 2018, \u201cUS Soccer has paid our women\u2019s national team more than our men\u2019s national team\u201d \u2013 $34.1m (\u00a328.1m) versus $26.4m. Furthermore, he added, the women receive benefits including healthcare, which the men don\u2019t. What does she make of Cordeiro\u2019s figures? \u201cWell, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re counting up every cent over 10 years,\u201d Rapinoe says, rolling her eyes. \u201cI would like to know what the potential of the men\u2019s contracts over the last 10 years would be compared with ours. We\u2019ve probably won 85% of our games over 10 years. And the men have clearly not. And [he says] we\u2019ve only been paid $8m more? We\u2019ve been to three World Cup finals and won two of them. Won the gold medals.\u201d Later that day, a spokeswoman for the men\u2019s national team joined the women\u2019s team players to accuse Cordeiro of using false accounting to inflate the women\u2019s salaries. So what now? Rapinoe looks very dry. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m excited to go to mediation, I guess.\u201d Rapinoe wants to encourage women to talk more openly about money. She is startlingly honest on the subject. I notice her gold Rolex and ask if she bought it as a victory gift; she smiles and says: \u201cI did. I\u2019ve been very intentional about talking about money recently. I think money for men is a sign of: \u2018Oh, I\u2019m the best,\u2019 a marker of where you are in your sport. And for women everything is always kept secret \u2013 which I think only hurts us. I want to know what everyone else is making, and I\u2019ll tell you: \u2018I did this appearance for this amount of money; how much are you doing it for? How much are you getting paid by Nike?\u2019 It\u2019s a little bit awkward. But then even in my close friend group we\u2019ve started talking about it and it takes the weird stigma out of it. Now I\u2019m starting to make a lot more money, so I\u2019m starting to splash a little bit more. So I have a $35,000 Rolex \u2013 people are going to know that.\u201d She is very aware of how this can sound and is keen to emphasise that, when it comes to \u201cthis whole equal pay thing, we\u2019re not poor. We\u2019re making a lot of money every year, so we need to find a way to talk about it. I\u2019ve never had another job. I make at least half a million dollars a year. But that doesn\u2019t mean that what we\u2019re getting is equal.\u201d For Rapinoe, speaking out is simply the duty of everyone with a conscience. \u201cHow can you see all the shit that\u2019s happening and not say anything? Everyone has the responsibility to do their part \u2013 I just happen to be naturally very confident, and it seems that people listen to me.\u201d She smiles. \u201cI\u2019m kind of charming and I\u2019m famous. So this is the way that I have to do it.\u201d Her straightforwardness is a large part of why people call her obnoxious. In different hands, this tone can seem smug, self-righteous or self-serving; she has been accused of all three. But in person it comes across as a kind of guileless unwillingness to circumvent the truth. Even when she praises herself, it is with a levity that pokes fun at what one can and can\u2019t say. It is very gratifying, she says, to say something stridently political and then watch the \u201cneedle move. I feel like we can see the world changing around us and we\u2019re a huge part of that, effecting that change.\u201d Can she give an example? \u201cI feel like gay rights \u2013 we\u2019ve been a huge part of that. You\u2019re starting to see more players come out. There could be more \u2013 I mean, people are still being beat up for being gay. Part of it is just about talking about it all the time and starting to break down stereotypes. When I came out, people said: \u2018OK, you have short hair, we sort of get it.\u2019 But then with Ashlyn [Harris] and Ali [Krieger] coming out, and Kelley [O\u2019Hara] kissing her girlfriend at the World Cup, stuff like that, the younger ones don\u2019t even need to come out, they\u2019re just out. They always were. So that\u2019s been really cool.\u201d Rapinoe is very proud of the pay equity campaign, although she is realistic about why it has gained such traction. \u201cWe\u2019re part of a much larger movement, and we\u2019re a little more relatable than actresses who make millions of dollars \u2013 not that that makes [the inequality] any better.\u201d A bigger part of it, however, is that \u201ctraditionally, we\u2019re very cute and white. If you juxtapose [publicity given to Rapinoe and her teammates] with [the way in which] the Women\u2019s Basketball Association has been fighting for all these things \u2013 but they\u2019re gay and black and nobody wants to talk about that.\u201d In the end, it comes down to a question of space: the politics, the celebrations, the fight for equal pay \u2013 even the pink hair. The night before Rapinoe left with the team for the World Cup, she announced to her girlfriend that she was going to dye her hair pink, a last-minute decision that, if it backfired, left no time for recovery. Bird, who is more of a worrier than Rapinoe, urged caution. \u201cHer thing was: \u2018Is this really what you want to do the day before you\u2019re going to be on the biggest stage of your life?\u2019\u201d Rapinoe grins. \u201cI said: \u2018That\u2019s exactly why I want to do it.\u2019\u201d Of course, it is not about the hair. Rapinoe understands the symbolism and she understands the stakes. \u201cI feel as if women are socialised not to take up space and men are. The team were called arrogant for our celebrations \u2013 for even planning a celebration and thinking we were going to win. Well, of course you think you\u2019re going to win \u2013 that\u2019s the whole point of the game.\u201d She looks incredulous. \u201cYou can be famous, and loud, and boisterous, and [stand] for good stuff, too, and do it all. You don\u2019t have to be this toiling woman all the time. No one\u2019s here for that any more.\u201d \u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

Since its premiere in the snows of Park City, Utah, the film has acquired an additional, rather illustrious claim to fame. It was picked up by Higher Ground Productions, the Netflix-allied production company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/apr/30/barack-obama-michelle-netflix-projects\" title=\"\">founded by Barack and Michelle Obama</a> last year, and is the first film from their stable to premiere on the service (it <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/81090071\" title=\"\">hits the Netflix menu</a> on Wednesday).

(It looks likely to appear at Sundance next year.) Tracing the conflicted growth of a Chinese-founded auto-glass factory in embattled industrial Ohio, <em>American Factory</em> is a suitable choice to announce their brand, though if you\u2019re fearing a dry civics lesson, prepare for a more intriguingly ambiguous culture-clash study.</p> <p>Local director duo Steven Bognar and Julia Reichert landed an Oscar nomination for their excellent 2009 short <em><a href=\"https://www.hbo.com/embed/documentaries/the-last-truck-closing-of-a-gm-plant/videos/promo\" title=\"\">The Last Truck: Closing of a GM Plant</a></em>, a humane, matter-of-fact study of a General Motors factory shut down in their hometown of Dayton, Ohio. (Sadly, unless you have access to US Amazon Prime, it doesn\u2019t appear to be easily streamable.) <em>American Factory</em> is a feature-length sequel they couldn\u2019t have anticipated then, following the 2014 resurrection of the factory site as Fuyao Glass America by the Chinese billionaire entrepreneur Cao Dewang.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/16/obamas-first-film-netflix-american-factory-biggest-documentary-2019\">The Obamas' first film: will American Factory be the biggest documentary of 2019?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Thousands of lost jobs were regained, mixed with imported, more skilled workers from China, but this is no late-capitalist fairytale. Wages and working conditions take a hit, while the necessity of labour unions becomes a bone of contention between American and Chinese factions. Even-handed but less than optimistic, with stray streaks of mordant humour, <em>American Factory</em> depicts the American dream in a state of adapt-or-die (or even adapt-and-die) compromise. Released into Trump\u2019s America, it will enrage some of the Make America Great Again contingent and leave others feeling dubiously vindicated. Here\u2019s hoping the Obamas\u2019 future producing endeavours are this complex and conversation-starting.</p> <p>I can think of no graceful segue from <em>American Factory</em> to <strong>The Third Wife</strong>, but Vietnamese director Ash Mayfair\u2019s debut feature \u2013 skipping cinemas, but available on DVD and <a href=\"https://player.bfi.org.uk/rentals/film/watch-the-third-wife-2018-online\" title=\"\">the BFI Player</a> \u2013 is so exquisite and under-the-radar that I had to give it a paragraph of its own.

It\u2019s sensuous, subtly furious film-making that pointedly contrasts its harsh gender relations with the ravishing delicacy of its imagery: shot like a watercolour in bamboo pastels, it might be the most gorgeous thing you see all year, even if not on the size of screen it deserves.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R0DHxKCrm0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6R0DHxKCrm0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R0DHxKCrm0\">Watch a trailer for The Third Wife.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <h2><strong>New to streaming &amp; DVD</strong></h2> <p><strong>Wild Rose</strong><br><em>(Universal, 15)</em><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/29/beast-review-jessie-buckley-johnny-flynn-dangerous-liaison\" title=\"\">Jessie Buckley</a> doubles down on the star-is-born promise she showed in <em>Beast</em>.

Tracing the conflicted growth of a Chinese-founded auto-glass factory in embattled industrial Ohio, American Factory is a suitable choice to announce their brand, though if you\u2019re fearing a dry civics lesson, prepare for a more intriguingly ambiguous culture-clash study. Local director duo Steven Bognar and Julia Reichert landed an Oscar nomination for their excellent 2009 short The Last Truck: Closing of a GM Plant, a humane, matter-of-fact study of a General Motors factory shut down in their hometown of Dayton, Ohio. (Sadly, unless you have access to US Amazon Prime, it doesn\u2019t appear to be easily streamable.) American Factory is a feature-length sequel they couldn\u2019t have anticipated then, following the 2014 resurrection of the factory site as Fuyao Glass America by the Chinese billionaire entrepreneur Cao Dewang. Thousands of lost jobs were regained, mixed with imported, more skilled workers from China, but this is no late-capitalist fairytale. Wages and working conditions take a hit, while the necessity of labour unions becomes a bone of contention between American and Chinese factions. Even-handed but less than optimistic, with stray streaks of mordant humour, American Factory depicts the American dream in a state of adapt-or-die (or even adapt-and-die) compromise. Released into Trump\u2019s America, it will enrage some of the Make America Great Again contingent and leave others feeling dubiously vindicated. Here\u2019s hoping the Obamas\u2019 future producing endeavours are this complex and conversation-starting. I can think of no graceful segue from American Factory to The Third Wife, but Vietnamese director Ash Mayfair\u2019s debut feature \u2013 skipping cinemas, but available on DVD and the BFI Player \u2013 is so exquisite and under-the-radar that I had to give it a paragraph of its own. Reminiscent of the early work of Tran Anh Hung (The Scent of Green Papaya) even before you notice him credited as an artistic adviser, this ornate 19th-century period piece with a bracingly contemporary feminist outlook centres on the personal awakening of a teenage bride \u2013 the third of a much older, polygamous landowner \u2013 finding her place in the world and household alike. It\u2019s sensuous, subtly furious film-making that pointedly contrasts its harsh gender relations with the ravishing delicacy of its imagery: shot like a watercolour in bamboo pastels, it might be the most gorgeous thing you see all year, even if not on the size of screen it deserves. New to streaming &amp; DVD Wild Rose (Universal, 15) Jessie Buckley doubles down on the star-is-born promise she showed in Beast. This heart-soaring story of a hard-up Glaswegian country singer has a few script cobwebs, but her thrilling performance blasts them away. Red Joan (Lionsgate, 12) Diverting but too tepid by half, Trevor Nunn\u2019s flashback-heavy thriller about a pensioner (Judi Dench) arrested on suspicion of being a communist Russian spy would have worked better as Sunday night telly. Pin Cushion (Spirit, 15) A belated DVD release for British director Deborah Haywood\u2019s flawed but stylistically adventurous debut, starring the superb Joanna Scanlan and Lily Newmark as a mother and daughter both facing bullying in a new town. Dragged Across Concrete (StudioCanal, 18) S Craig Zahler is a brilliant genre film-maker who delights in political aggravation. Case in point: casting Mel Gibson and Vince Vaughn in a stylish, rock-hard-boiled study of police violence with debatable sympathies. Cruising (Arrow, 18) Another one for the problematic-but-fascinating pile, William Friedkin\u2019s notorious serial killer thriller set in the gay S&amp;M underground gets a comprehensive Blu-ray restoration. It\u2019s dated in some ways, and still subversive in others.",

Peierls and his colleague Otto Frisch had hit on an ingenious way of making a nuclear explosive, by smashing together a sufficient quantity of a rare isotope of uranium.

      "body": "<p>If you want to know the difference between a sports massage and a regular massage, you can scour the internet for ever. You will find sports masseurs making snide jokes about candles and whale music, and regular masseurs reminding the world that you don\u2019t need to wear Lycra to understand anatomy. It wasn\u2019t until I spoke to Kate Kahle, a sports massage therapist for 25 years, that I really understood. \u201cSports massage usually just targets a specific issue,\u201d she said. \u201cA regular massage will be the whole body. So a client might come in with shoulder problems, and as well as looking at the part that\u2019s hurting, I look for the connections too.\u201d In other words: regular massage makes you feel relaxed; sports massage stops things hurting.</p> <p>I have never been interested in massage: I\u2019ve always taken the opportunity to go immediately to sleep, missed the fabled benefits, then jolted into consciousness at 50 minutes, startled and a bit ashamed, wondering what he or she had to do to wake me up.</p> <p>Then I hurt my neck, and had a sports massage from someone a friend recommended. It was an experience that cleared up the mystery of why, when you ask someone if they know an acupuncturist, for example, they\u2019ll say, \u201cI went to a brilliant guy, once, but he did puncture someone\u2019s lung and I can\u2019t remember his name,\u201d whereas when you cast around for a sports massage therapist, people fall to their knees. The person they know is an angel; a miracle worker. Plainly, if there\u2019s one thing people really like, it\u2019s when things stop hurting.</p> <p>\u201cEvery massage therapist has to have a basic anatomy and physiology qualification,\u201d Kahle explains, \u201cbut when you\u2019re trying to solve problems, you have to know how everything connects, where the attachment points are, how the circulatory system works.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jul/27/fit-in-40s-velodrome-need-nerves-of-steel-zoe-williams\">Fit in my 40s: welcome to the velodrome. You\u2019ll need nerves of steel | Zoe Williams</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Muscles like to be stretched; tendons and ligaments, not so much. A good therapist can feel something deeper than tightness or tension; they can feel your heat in their fingers. \u201cThere will be increased blood circulation to injured areas,\u201d says Kahle. \u201cThat\u2019s the body\u2019s way of saying there\u2019s a problem.\u201d</p> <p>Wherever that problem is, it most likely either didn\u2019t start there or will lead to something worse: that\u2019s part of the talismanic property of the massage therapist \u2013 locating the source of the damage. It turns out that if your neck is killing you and you can\u2019t even remember using it for sport, it might not even have been sport that did the damage; it could just as well be related to your sedentary lifestyle, to the way you cradle a phone between your ear and shoulder, to the ricocheting impact of one muscle\u2019s tension upon another\u2019s recovery.</p> <p>In truth, I\u2019ve been putting my neck out now and then for 20 years. I\u2019ve tried everything: acupuncture, osteopathy, even asking the GP. Everything helps eventually, but nothing works as fast as this. I felt basically cured in one session. .</p> <h2>What I learned</h2> <p>Regular massage can help maintain flexibility as you age by increasing blood flow.</p>",

      "bodyText": "If you want to know the difference between a sports massage and a regular massage, you can scour the internet for ever. You will find sports masseurs making snide jokes about candles and whale music, and regular masseurs reminding the world that you don\u2019t need to wear Lycra to understand anatomy. It wasn\u2019t until I spoke to Kate Kahle, a sports massage therapist for 25 years, that I really understood. \u201cSports massage usually just targets a specific issue,\u201d she said. \u201cA regular massage will be the whole body. So a client might come in with shoulder problems, and as well as looking at the part that\u2019s hurting, I look for the connections too.\u201d In other words: regular massage makes you feel relaxed; sports massage stops things hurting. I have never been interested in massage: I\u2019ve always taken the opportunity to go immediately to sleep, missed the fabled benefits, then jolted into consciousness at 50 minutes, startled and a bit ashamed, wondering what he or she had to do to wake me up. Then I hurt my neck, and had a sports massage from someone a friend recommended. It was an experience that cleared up the mystery of why, when you ask someone if they know an acupuncturist, for example, they\u2019ll say, \u201cI went to a brilliant guy, once, but he did puncture someone\u2019s lung and I can\u2019t remember his name,\u201d whereas when you cast around for a sports massage therapist, people fall to their knees. The person they know is an angel; a miracle worker. Plainly, if there\u2019s one thing people really like, it\u2019s when things stop hurting. \u201cEvery massage therapist has to have a basic anatomy and physiology qualification,\u201d Kahle explains, \u201cbut when you\u2019re trying to solve problems, you have to know how everything connects, where the attachment points are, how the circulatory system works.\u201d Muscles like to be stretched; tendons and ligaments, not so much. A good therapist can feel something deeper than tightness or tension; they can feel your heat in their fingers. \u201cThere will be increased blood circulation to injured areas,\u201d says Kahle. \u201cThat\u2019s the body\u2019s way of saying there\u2019s a problem.\u201d Wherever that problem is, it most likely either didn\u2019t start there or will lead to something worse: that\u2019s part of the talismanic property of the massage therapist \u2013 locating the source of the damage. It turns out that if your neck is killing you and you can\u2019t even remember using it for sport, it might not even have been sport that did the damage; it could just as well be related to your sedentary lifestyle, to the way you cradle a phone between your ear and shoulder, to the ricocheting impact of one muscle\u2019s tension upon another\u2019s recovery. In truth, I\u2019ve been putting my neck out now and then for 20 years. I\u2019ve tried everything: acupuncture, osteopathy, even asking the GP. Everything helps eventually, but nothing works as fast as this. I felt basically cured in one session. . What I learned Regular massage can help maintain flexibility as you age by increasing blood flow.",

But now, concerns of an economic downturn, buoyed by the president\u2019s escalating trade wars, have threatened to undermine the core of his case for a second term in the White House. Trump\u2019s handling of the economy has earned him flashes of positive marks in an otherwise polarizing tenure in office.

      "body": "<p>How much will you really spend in your first year at university? Accommodation costs at universities have soared in recent years, while everyday living costs continue to march upwards. As we explore here, rich students are being lured by super-luxe developments charging annual rents of above \u00a320,000. Below we set out what a more typical student may spend on a room, the likely monthly costs for essentials such as food and studying materials \u2013 and work out what parents will have to stump up on top of the loans and grants.</p> <p><strong>Rent: Expect to spend about \u00a3600 a month<br></strong>The typical student will pay around \u00a3140 a week for university-supplied accommodation in their first year, so expect to cough up a total of nearly \u00a36,000 for a 40 to 42-week academic year, with London averages closer to \u00a38,000.</p> <p>Student rents have jumped by a third since 2011-12, rising at far more than the general rate of inflation, and now eat up 73% of the maximum cash available to students in the form of grants and, more likely, loans.</p> <p>Unaffordable rents are a greater issue for studentsthan even tuition fees, with the average UK undergraduate expected to pay \u00a3147 a week, according to a National Union of Students-Unipol survey. That was for 2018-19, with those starting this year almost certainly paying more. Many fall behind, with 17,000 students in university rent arrears last year.</p> <p>Some official residences now charge more than \u00a320,000 a year. London School of Economics offers studio rooms at its Urbanest building in Lambeth on the south side of the Thames for up to \u00a3405 a week. For that, the student gets a 22.1m<sup>2</sup> room (about the size of a large living-room) tied into a contract for 50 weeks a year costing \u00a320,223.</p> <p>The cheapest UK location for student accommodation is in Derry, Northern Ireland, where Ulster University charges \u00a375 a week at its Coppin Hall residence, and says it has frozen prices since last year. You get a \u201cspacious study-bedroom, fully equipped with a bed, desk, chair, wardrobe and bedside locker\u201d. Other notably cheap universities for accommodation are Bradford, Huddersfield and Bangor, which all offer private rooms in the \u00a380 to \u00a385 a week bracket.</p> <p>Oxford is curiously cheap. Although the city has some of the UK\u2019s highest house prices, heavily subsidised in-college student accommodation is typically about \u00a34,000 a year, while three meals a day will add a further \u00a31,600.</p> <p>Students (and their parents) are faced with a bewildering number of options at the major metropolitan universities. For instance, Bristol offers 25 options to new undergraduates, ranging from \u00a3107 to \u00a3167 a week for self-catered units and up to \u00a3201 a week (\u00a38,450 a year) for catered rooms.</p> <p>Look out for contract length: for instance the University of East Anglia offers a minimum 38-week licence for a room, whereas York charges for a minimum of 40 weeks and Leeds 42. UEA\u2019s shared twin rooms are great value, if you can stomach living with someone else.</p> <p>Second-year students moving into the private rented sector frequently underestimate other costs such as broadband and water charges, which can add up to \u00a3200 a month for a large shared household. Remember, full-time students don\u2019t have to pay council tax. Also factor in that private landlords will require students to pay rent all year, so bills are payable throughout the long summer holiday \u2013 even though you may not be there.</p> <p>Many students say the only viable route to tackling rent is to protest. Matthew Lee, a third-year student at UCL in London, says: \u201cIn my first year I was in hall, paying around \u00a3200 a week. The rent was more than my student loan. The university had very, very little alternative accommodation cheaper than that.</p> <p>\u201cThey should be developing cheaper accommodation. Instead, what we\u2019re seeing is old halls demolished and redeveloped into luxury accommodation with massive rent increases.\u201d</p> <p>Lee is part of rent-strike.org, and says protests against UCL rents \u2013 such as a rent strike by 1,100 students in 2016 \u2013 have won millions in compensation, bursaries and rent cuts. The movement has spread across the UK, with \u201cCut the rent\u201d campaigns springing up from Aberdeen to Sussex.</p> <p>In a statement, UCL said it \u201cprovides some of the most affordable accommodation in central London when compared to equivalent London institutions and the private sector.</p> <p>\u201cKeeping rents as low as possible for residents is a top priority and we have agreed to freeze rents on 21% of rooms at the lowest price bracket for the 2019/20 academic year.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Living: a typical student will spend \u00a3375 a month<br></strong>The typical student will spend around \u00a3375 a month One the hardest calls for first-timers students \u2013 and more likely their parents \u2013 is identifying how much they are going to need to get through each month.</p> <p>The website<a href=\"https://www.savethestudent.org/money/student-money-survey-2019.html\"> Save the Student recently asked 3,385 students where, after rent, all their money goes</a> \u2013 an amount totalling about \u00a3376 a month.</p> <p>Students told researchers that they spend just over \u00a320 a week (or \u00a392 a month) on basic food shopping and supermarket-bought booze \u2013 plus a further \u00a334 a month on takeaways.</p> <p>The next biggest expense is \u00a350 a month on entertainment \u2013 which equates to just \u00a311 a week. Transport costs \u2013 getting to and from university at the start and end of term, plus the cost of getting to classes on a daily basis \u2013 are surprisingly high, at \u00a344 a month. Household bills and clothes account for about \u00a330 a month, while mobile phone and course materials account both come in at about \u00a317 a month.</p> <p>Once holidays (\u00a324 a month) and gym memberships (\u00a313 a month) are added \u2013 plus, according to the survey, an average of \u00a34 a month on illegal drugs \u2013 it gives a grand total of \u00a3376. This figure disguises the regional variations \u2013 clearly students in London will need significantly more spending money than those living in Bangor or Ulster.</p> <p>One of the big ways to reduce spending is to choose accommodation close to where you will be studying. Even bus fares across, say Manchester, will really add up, meaning a more expensive but better-located halls of residence could be cheaper in the long run.</p> <p>A bicycle will save a fortune if you have to cross a city each day. The cost of public transport is another reason to avoid studying in London, especially if the hall of residence is in a outer zone area.</p> <p>Other \u201chidden\u201d costs to factor in are things like a television licence (\u00a3154.50 a year), which you will need if you want to watch live TV or catch-up on iPlayer. Other catch-up services don\u2019t require a licence.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s insurance to cover the cost of your belongings. If you need insurance to cover your belongings while away from home, Moneysupermarket recently said the average cost of contents cover for young people is \u00a363 a year. If you just have an expensive laptop, it may be a better bet to rely on your parent\u2019s home insurance instead.</p> <p>First-year students in halls will avoid gas and electricity and other bills, such as broadband, but generally face higher \u201cgoing out\u201d costs. But there\u2019s other start-up costs \u2013 pots, pans, kettles, duvets, and so on \u2013 depending on the accommodation package provided by the university. It\u2019s a good idea to cosy up to grandparents and tell them about the \u00a335 five-pan cookware deal in Asda or the \u00a330 and \u00a380 student starter packs at Ikea.</p> <p><strong>Parents: It\u2019s likely to cost you around \u00a32,000 a year<br></strong>Every week Save the Student says it receives emails from parents asking how much they can expect to pay, and the answer for many is: probably more than you were expecting. Only students who come from households that have an income of \u00a325,000 or less will be entitled to receive the full \u00a38,944 a year maintenance loan, which is supposed to cover a student\u2019s living costs \u2013 but with rents at \u00a36,000 or more, it rarely does. If the household income is greater than \u00a325,000, the government expects the parents to make a contribution. It is all now means-tested, with the highest earners expected to hand over most.</p> <p>If the parents have a joint household income of \u00a335,000, the student is entitled to a maintenance loan of \u00a37,661, so there is a minimum parental contribution of \u00a31,283 a year. This will give the student a total of \u00a38,944, the minimum the government expects them to receive.</p> <p>Those coming from a \u00a350,000 income household can apply for a maintenance loan of \u00a35,735, with the parents expected to stump up \u00a33,209 a year. Once the household income goes above \u00a362,215, the parent is expected to contribute \u00a34,776 a year.</p> <p>These figures apply in England, and are for those students who are moving away from home, and studying outside London. Those heading to the capital can borrow up to \u00a311,672 a year \u2013 which is again means-tested, and requires similar parental contributions.</p> <p>The problem is that for many students, the total of just under \u00a39,000 a year is not going to cover their basic living costs. Students are typically left with a \u00a33,000 shortfall, so their parents will either have to cover it, or the student has to work or borrow the rest.</p> <p>Save the Student says in its 2018 survey, students reported receiving an average of \u00a3138 a month from parents. But a frequent complaint is that they just don\u2019t get sufficient parental contributions. The way the scheme is administered penalises those with large families who might have more than one student studying at any one time, as this is not taken into account.</p> <p>On the flipside, some parents do not want their student offspring to be racking up such big debts, and will contribute far more than the required amount.</p> <p>It\u2019s worth noting that household income calculation are often gamed. Divorced couples frequently choose to house their student son or daughter with the parent on the lowest income \u2013 meaning they receive a higher government-backed loan. If you are planning to retire, you might want to bring it forward, particularly if you have more than one child heading to university.</p> <p>To work out your expected contribution, go to the official <a href=\"http:// www.gov.uk/student-finance-calculator\" title=\"\">student finance calculator </a>for England.</p>",

Students (and their parents) are faced with a bewildering number of options at the major metropolitan universities. For instance, Bristol offers 25 options to new undergraduates, ranging from \u00a3107 to \u00a3167 a week for self-catered units and up to \u00a3201 a week (\u00a38,450 a year) for catered rooms. Look out for contract length: for instance the University of East Anglia offers a minimum 38-week licence for a room, whereas York charges for a minimum of 40 weeks and Leeds 42. UEA\u2019s shared twin rooms are great value, if you can stomach living with someone else. Second-year students moving into the private rented sector frequently underestimate other costs such as broadband and water charges, which can add up to \u00a3200 a month for a large shared household. Remember, full-time students don\u2019t have to pay council tax. Also factor in that private landlords will require students to pay rent all year, so bills are payable throughout the long summer holiday \u2013 even though you may not be there. Many students say the only viable route to tackling rent is to protest. Matthew Lee, a third-year student at UCL in London, says: \u201cIn my first year I was in hall, paying around \u00a3200 a week. The rent was more than my student loan. The university had very, very little alternative accommodation cheaper than that. \u201cThey should be developing cheaper accommodation. Instead, what we\u2019re seeing is old halls demolished and redeveloped into luxury accommodation with massive rent increases.\u201d Lee is part of rent-strike.org, and says protests against UCL rents \u2013 such as a rent strike by 1,100 students in 2016 \u2013 have won millions in compensation, bursaries and rent cuts. The movement has spread across the UK, with \u201cCut the rent\u201d campaigns springing up from Aberdeen to Sussex. In a statement, UCL said it \u201cprovides some of the most affordable accommodation in central London when compared to equivalent London institutions and the private sector. \u201cKeeping rents as low as possible for residents is a top priority and we have agreed to freeze rents on 21% of rooms at the lowest price bracket for the 2019/20 academic year.\u201d Living: a typical student will spend \u00a3375 a month The typical student will spend around \u00a3375 a month One the hardest calls for first-timers students \u2013 and more likely their parents \u2013 is identifying how much they are going to need to get through each month. The website Save the Student recently asked 3,385 students where, after rent, all their money goes \u2013 an amount totalling about \u00a3376 a month. Students told researchers that they spend just over \u00a320 a week (or \u00a392 a month) on basic food shopping and supermarket-bought booze \u2013 plus a further \u00a334 a month on takeaways. The next biggest expense is \u00a350 a month on entertainment \u2013 which equates to just \u00a311 a week. Transport costs \u2013 getting to and from university at the start and end of term, plus the cost of getting to classes on a daily basis \u2013 are surprisingly high, at \u00a344 a month. Household bills and clothes account for about \u00a330 a month, while mobile phone and course materials account both come in at about \u00a317 a month. Once holidays (\u00a324 a month) and gym memberships (\u00a313 a month) are added \u2013 plus, according to the survey, an average of \u00a34 a month on illegal drugs \u2013 it gives a grand total of \u00a3376. This figure disguises the regional variations \u2013 clearly students in London will need significantly more spending money than those living in Bangor or Ulster. One of the big ways to reduce spending is to choose accommodation close to where you will be studying. Even bus fares across, say Manchester, will really add up, meaning a more expensive but better-located halls of residence could be cheaper in the long run. A bicycle will save a fortune if you have to cross a city each day. The cost of public transport is another reason to avoid studying in London, especially if the hall of residence is in a outer zone area. Other \u201chidden\u201d costs to factor in are things like a television licence (\u00a3154.50 a year), which you will need if you want to watch live TV or catch-up on iPlayer. Other catch-up services don\u2019t require a licence. Then there\u2019s insurance to cover the cost of your belongings. If you need insurance to cover your belongings while away from home, Moneysupermarket recently said the average cost of contents cover for young people is \u00a363 a year. If you just have an expensive laptop, it may be a better bet to rely on your parent\u2019s home insurance instead. First-year students in halls will avoid gas and electricity and other bills, such as broadband, but generally face higher \u201cgoing out\u201d costs. But there\u2019s other start-up costs \u2013 pots, pans, kettles, duvets, and so on \u2013 depending on the accommodation package provided by the university. It\u2019s a good idea to cosy up to grandparents and tell them about the \u00a335 five-pan cookware deal in Asda or the \u00a330 and \u00a380 student starter packs at Ikea. Parents: It\u2019s likely to cost you around \u00a32,000 a year Every week Save the Student says it receives emails from parents asking how much they can expect to pay, and the answer for many is: probably more than you were expecting. Only students who come from households that have an income of \u00a325,000 or less will be entitled to receive the full \u00a38,944 a year maintenance loan, which is supposed to cover a student\u2019s living costs \u2013 but with rents at \u00a36,000 or more, it rarely does. If the household income is greater than \u00a325,000, the government expects the parents to make a contribution. It is all now means-tested, with the highest earners expected to hand over most. If the parents have a joint household income of \u00a335,000, the student is entitled to a maintenance loan of \u00a37,661, so there is a minimum parental contribution of \u00a31,283 a year. This will give the student a total of \u00a38,944, the minimum the government expects them to receive. Those coming from a \u00a350,000 income household can apply for a maintenance loan of \u00a35,735, with the parents expected to stump up \u00a33,209 a year. Once the household income goes above \u00a362,215, the parent is expected to contribute \u00a34,776 a year. These figures apply in England, and are for those students who are moving away from home, and studying outside London. Those heading to the capital can borrow up to \u00a311,672 a year \u2013 which is again means-tested, and requires similar parental contributions. The problem is that for many students, the total of just under \u00a39,000 a year is not going to cover their basic living costs. Students are typically left with a \u00a33,000 shortfall, so their parents will either have to cover it, or the student has to work or borrow the rest. Save the Student says in its 2018 survey, students reported receiving an average of \u00a3138 a month from parents. But a frequent complaint is that they just don\u2019t get sufficient parental contributions. The way the scheme is administered penalises those with large families who might have more than one student studying at any one time, as this is not taken into account. On the flipside, some parents do not want their student offspring to be racking up such big debts, and will contribute far more than the required amount. It\u2019s worth noting that household income calculation are often gamed. Divorced couples frequently choose to house their student son or daughter with the parent on the lowest income \u2013 meaning they receive a higher government-backed loan. If you are planning to retire, you might want to bring it forward, particularly if you have more than one child heading to university. To work out your expected contribution, go to the official student finance calculator for England.",

I more or less fell in love with the place before I got here. First, I\u2019d been seduced by a photograph of Jorquera \u2013 a village on a rock that looked so magical, I couldn\u2019t quite believe it wasn\u2019t computer-generated. Then I heard about a new boutique cave hotel nearby (Xuq \u2013 more on that later).</p> <p>And Alcal\u00e1, I read (thanks to Google Translate) \u201cis a wonder to discover \u2026 a place of unique natural environments and a very unique architecture\u201d.</p> <p>It has quite a lot in common with Matera \u2013 the rock-hewn city in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/may/19/holiday-guide-basilicata-italy-best-hotels-restaurants\" title=\"\">Basilicata</a>, southern Italy, which is currently enjoying a year as a European Capital of Culture. Like Matera, many of J\u00facar\u2019s villages are carved from the cliffs of a gorge; both have underground tunnels, grotto-like cave dwellings and medieval roots. But while Matera is struggling to cope with visitor numbers, J\u00facar\u2019s inspiring landscapes (Alcal\u00e1 was named a site of special historic and artistic heritage in 1982) remain largely unknown. So if you don\u2019t fancy elbowing your way through the Sassi di Matera, this could be a quieter, more adventurous alternative.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a63765cccd97adb0acdc8b3067514fadf5e3e555\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a63765cccd97adb0acdc8b3067514fadf5e3e555/0_181_4500_2701/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alcal\u00e1 del J\u00facar on the edge of the gorge.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alcal\u00e1 del J\u00facar on the edge of the gorge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We arrive from Alicante \u2013 a two-hour drive. One minute we are rolling across the grassy plains of Castilla-La Mancha, the next we plunge into the gorge. On empty roads, hugging the banks of the River J\u00facar, we loop around giant rocky outcrops, slip under bulges of limestone overhang and zigzag up and down vertiginous cliffs. There are views to take your breath away at every hairpin bend. My husband, Dave, is wishing he\u2019d brought his bike (he says it again \u2013 \u201cthis is better than the Alps\u201d).</p> <p>The young woman from the tourist office \u2013 Petra, a Slovakian, married to a local lad she met on a kayaking holiday \u2013 jumps at the chance to practise her rusty English and takes us on a walking tour of her adopted home.</p> <p>We begin with the castle, a Moorish fortress perched atop a tower of rock with dizzy views of Alcal\u00e1 as it tumbles downhill, slipping into folds and fissures of the valley and leaning into its rugged limestone walls. Petra points out the egg-shaped bullring (which may be Roman), the Roman bridge (which isn\u2019t), and the 15th-century bell tower of San Andr\u00e9s church. Alcal\u00e1\u2019s uneven terraces of white and terracotta houses look as though they have been pressed into the rock. Half-house, half-cave seems to be the norm around here.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"e86b83eeeb4b8ff65540c500ea1cb04b88dadc7f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e86b83eeeb4b8ff65540c500ea1cb04b88dadc7f/9_0_1655_993/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alcal\u00e1, with J\u00facar bridge and fortress atop the crag\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alcal\u00e1, with J\u00facar bridge and fortress atop the crag.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph:  Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.casasruralesriojucar.es/casa-cueva-alcala-del-jucar-visitela-le-sorprendera/\" title=\"\">Casa Cueva el Castillo</a> is a once-ruined cave house that has been restored and turned into a mini-museum. The dug-out rooms once lived in by peasant farmers (nobody seems sure exactly when) have fresh white paint and are filled with rustic furniture, pottery and old farm tools. To add authenticity, there are live chickens in the yard, and a donkey called Margarita in a rock-cut stable.</p> <p>Donkeys aside, hundreds of J\u00facar\u2019s caves, just like this one, are still inhabited.

      "bodyText": "The young woman in Alcal\u00e1 del J\u00facar\u2019s tourist office seems surprised when we say we have come from England. \u201cHow did you find us?\u201d she asks. \u201cNobody knows about this place.\u201d Nobody, she means, except the Spanish, and even for them, Alcal\u00e1 is far from famous. In La Manchuela, in central Spain, Alcal\u00e1 is one of a string of villages in the J\u00facar canyon, a spectacular limestone gorge running for some 40km through the province of Albacete. I more or less fell in love with the place before I got here. First, I\u2019d been seduced by a photograph of Jorquera \u2013 a village on a rock that looked so magical, I couldn\u2019t quite believe it wasn\u2019t computer-generated. Then I heard about a new boutique cave hotel nearby (Xuq \u2013 more on that later). And Alcal\u00e1, I read (thanks to Google Translate) \u201cis a wonder to discover \u2026 a place of unique natural environments and a very unique architecture\u201d. It has quite a lot in common with Matera \u2013 the rock-hewn city in Basilicata, southern Italy, which is currently enjoying a year as a European Capital of Culture. Like Matera, many of J\u00facar\u2019s villages are carved from the cliffs of a gorge; both have underground tunnels, grotto-like cave dwellings and medieval roots. But while Matera is struggling to cope with visitor numbers, J\u00facar\u2019s inspiring landscapes (Alcal\u00e1 was named a site of special historic and artistic heritage in 1982) remain largely unknown. So if you don\u2019t fancy elbowing your way through the Sassi di Matera, this could be a quieter, more adventurous alternative. We arrive from Alicante \u2013 a two-hour drive. One minute we are rolling across the grassy plains of Castilla-La Mancha, the next we plunge into the gorge. On empty roads, hugging the banks of the River J\u00facar, we loop around giant rocky outcrops, slip under bulges of limestone overhang and zigzag up and down vertiginous cliffs. There are views to take your breath away at every hairpin bend. My husband, Dave, is wishing he\u2019d brought his bike (he says it again \u2013 \u201cthis is better than the Alps\u201d). The young woman from the tourist office \u2013 Petra, a Slovakian, married to a local lad she met on a kayaking holiday \u2013 jumps at the chance to practise her rusty English and takes us on a walking tour of her adopted home. We begin with the castle, a Moorish fortress perched atop a tower of rock with dizzy views of Alcal\u00e1 as it tumbles downhill, slipping into folds and fissures of the valley and leaning into its rugged limestone walls. Petra points out the egg-shaped bullring (which may be Roman), the Roman bridge (which isn\u2019t), and the 15th-century bell tower of San Andr\u00e9s church. Alcal\u00e1\u2019s uneven terraces of white and terracotta houses look as though they have been pressed into the rock. Half-house, half-cave seems to be the norm around here. Casa Cueva el Castillo is a once-ruined cave house that has been restored and turned into a mini-museum. The dug-out rooms once lived in by peasant farmers (nobody seems sure exactly when) have fresh white paint and are filled with rustic furniture, pottery and old farm tools. To add authenticity, there are live chickens in the yard, and a donkey called Margarita in a rock-cut stable. Donkeys aside, hundreds of J\u00facar\u2019s caves, just like this one, are still inhabited. There are cave rooms under our feet, Petra tells us, as we walk the cobbled streets down to the river. Some are open to the public \u2013 if you can find them. An inconspicuous doorway leads into the Cave of King Garaden \u2013 a vast subterranean palace used as a stronghold in the 12th century, with a 170-metre tunnel that takes us under the castle to a medieval lookout cut high in the gorge. The passage, which is cool, dank and dimly lit, probably hasn\u2019t changed in hundreds of years. From here a staircase takes us down to Cuevas del Diablo, named after its current owner \u2013 El Diablo, a nickname he picked up in childhood. A poet and former bullfighter with a waxed Salvador Dal\u00ed moustache, this \u201cdevil\u201d has furnished his warren of caves \u2013 some of which he dug himself \u2013 with a large and eccentric collection of vintage stuff (sewing machines, radios, guns, cash registers, numerous Diablo selfies). At one time, he ran a nightclub here: a glitter ball still sprinkles light on the craggy walls of a cave the size of a ballroom. The \u20ac3 entry fee includes Garaden\u2019s cave, a drink from the bar there and entry to Alcal\u00e1\u2019s disused cinema. Another Diablo enterprise, this too is crowded with curious collectables (a stuffed gorilla in a telephone box, rusty farm implements, a horseless cart) but high up on the balcony, rows of hard bench seats and an original projector recall this atmospheric relic\u2019s silent-movie roots. At Caf\u00e9 Masago, in another street, in another cave, at the end of another long tunnel, we eat slow-cooked partridge with white beans and a gazpacho manchego \u2013 a rustic La Manchuela stew of rabbit or chicken (or both) cooked with squares of unleavened bread. Seated at a circular window cut into the stone, we are at the penthouse level of the gorge, with views of the river a hundred metres or so below. The sinuous J\u00facar is a green snake of a river, flanked by forest, river beaches and allotments: the latter a patchwork of fruit trees, almonds, olives and neat rows of lettuce.

There are several cheap hostales in Alcal\u00e1, but we spend the night in one of its cave-house holiday homes. Casa Cueva Las Tinajas de Naya (sleeps six from \u20ac300) resembles a normal village house from the outside but inside, three windowless double bedrooms have been scooped out of the rock \u2013 dark, womb-like and completely silent, other than the hum of a dehumidifier. In the morning, we follow the J\u00facar to Tolosa, a tiny hamlet 6km to the east, where the river widens and the vertical gorge is green with aromatic forests of juniper and pine.

In the opposite direction, Jorquera \u2013 half an hour\u2019s drive from Alcal\u00e1, is the walled medieval village whose photograph brought me here. From a bend in the road that climbs out of the gorge, we stop to take a photograph: perched on a lump of rock, with the river wrapped around its base like a moat, Jorquera looks like a floating island. With one tiny shop and a restaurant-bar that isn\u2019t open, deserted Jorquera seems locked in a time-warp but at the foot of its cliff we find an unexpected pocket of 21st-century cool.

But I find Fortnite completely impenetrable, and I now have to listen to my kids talk about great Fortnite players with more affection than they do their parents. I constantly walk past their rooms to the sounds of, \u201cAw man Ninja 120 is the absolute best\u201d, or \u201cAlpha Bum posted up a video of him killing 12 enemies with just a crossbow!\u201d I can feel the common ground between us disappearing.</p> <p>My kids are very different to how I remember being at their age with regards to interests. They are really keen for my wife and me to be across all this crap. I went into my eldest son\u2019s room when he was in the middle of a game and asked him to talk me through it. He proceeded to give me an in-depth tutorial that consisted of him running around, building weird structures and shooting people, while asking me if I was getting it. I really wasn\u2019t. And what\u2019s frustrating is I\u2019m a gamer, albeit a casual one. I\u2019ll play anything Mario- or Zelda-related, but Fortnite is one step beyond me. I don\u2019t get anything from it but motion sickness and an increased sense of anxiety about how violent future generations are going to be.</p> <p>He went on to YouTube and started showing me videos posted by the best players in the world, the likes of whom recently won shedloads of money in the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/02/what-can-traditional-sports-learn-from-the-fortnite-world-cup\" title=\"\"> Fortnite World Cup</a>. I watched these videos of people running about shooting and drinking potion, and every now and again my son would say: \u201cHow sick was that move?\u201d and I would nod while wondering how much longer I would have to watch before I could ask to stop, without hurting his feelings. I guess this is what it felt like when an earlier generation of kids started getting into punk or hip-hop. But that happened to teenagers. My kids aren\u2019t even 10 yet.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/aug/10/romesh-ranganathan-am-i-too-old-to-wow-the-beach-in-lime-co-ords\">Romesh Ranganathan: am I too old to wow the beach in lime co-ords?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I am going to have to find a way into Fortnite.

But I find Fortnite completely impenetrable, and I now have to listen to my kids talk about great Fortnite players with more affection than they do their parents. I constantly walk past their rooms to the sounds of, \u201cAw man Ninja 120 is the absolute best\u201d, or \u201cAlpha Bum posted up a video of him killing 12 enemies with just a crossbow!\u201d I can feel the common ground between us disappearing. My kids are very different to how I remember being at their age with regards to interests. They are really keen for my wife and me to be across all this crap. I went into my eldest son\u2019s room when he was in the middle of a game and asked him to talk me through it. He proceeded to give me an in-depth tutorial that consisted of him running around, building weird structures and shooting people, while asking me if I was getting it. I really wasn\u2019t. And what\u2019s frustrating is I\u2019m a gamer, albeit a casual one. I\u2019ll play anything Mario- or Zelda-related, but Fortnite is one step beyond me. I don\u2019t get anything from it but motion sickness and an increased sense of anxiety about how violent future generations are going to be. He went on to YouTube and started showing me videos posted by the best players in the world, the likes of whom recently won shedloads of money in the Fortnite World Cup. I watched these videos of people running about shooting and drinking potion, and every now and again my son would say: \u201cHow sick was that move?\u201d and I would nod while wondering how much longer I would have to watch before I could ask to stop, without hurting his feelings. I guess this is what it felt like when an earlier generation of kids started getting into punk or hip-hop. But that happened to teenagers. My kids aren\u2019t even 10 yet. I am going to have to find a way into Fortnite. But I am now of the belief that this has to become an undercover mission, so that I can become good at it without looking like I\u2019m trying. I am going to access it at work, train, and become incredible. Then I am going to enter one of their battles as DaddyKnowsBest and lay waste to them and their friends. I will unmask myself and wait for their adulation as they realise that I am the coolest dad in the country. The truth is, however, that I had a go the other night after they had gone to sleep and I couldn\u2019t even figure out the bloody controls. I\u2019ve decided that having a connection with my kids might not be worth the effort.",

      "bodyText": "Before you start on any of these jams, sterilise jars and lids. Wash them in hot, soapy water and rinse well. Drip-dry upside down, then put in an oven heated to 100C (90C fan)/gas \u00bc for at least 20 minutes. Meanwhile, put a few small plates in the freezer in preparation for the \u201cwrinkle test.\u201d Sealed, the jam will keep for up to 12 months. Once opened, keep refrigerated and eat within three months. Gooseberry and camomile jam Prep 15 min Cook 25 min Makes 8 x 228ml jars 2 tbsp loose camomile tea or flowers 1.5kg gooseberries 60ml lemon juice 700g sugar Sterilise the jars and lids, and put a few small plates in the freezer, as described above. Brew the camomile tea or flowers in 250ml just-boiled water for five minutes. Wash the gooseberries and cut off the little brown tops. In a large, wide-rimmed, stainless-steel saucepan or jam pan, soften the gooseberries on a medium-high heat with the lemon juice and brewed tea (flowers and all, if using). Simmer for five to 10 minutes, stirring frequently so that the mixture doesn\u2019t stick to the bottom of the pan and burn. Slowly pour in the sugar, stirring until it dissolves completely. Increase the heat and boil over a high heat for about 10-15 minutes, until it reaches 104C on a thermometer, or the rolling boil turns into heavier, ploppy bubbles. When you think it\u2019s ready, take off the heat and do the wrinkle test: put a quarter-teaspoon of jam on to a pre-frozen plate and put in the fridge for a minute. Remove from the fridge and push the jam with your finger; it should have a slight wrinkle on the surface, similar to when boiled milk forms a skin. If there\u2019s no wrinkle, put the pan back on a high heat, keep cooking and test again every few minutes until the wrinkle has been achieved. When the jam is ready, skim off and discard any froth that has formed on the surface, then ladle into hot, sterilised jars. Clean the rim of the jar and seal immediately. Raspberry and cacao nib jam Prep 10 min Cook 20 min Makes 6 x 228ml jars 1.8kg raspberries 60ml lemon juice 700g sugar \u00bc tsp vanilla essence or vanilla bean paste 1 tbsp cacao nibs Sterilise the jars and lids as described above, and put a few small plates in the freezer. Gently wash the raspberries, if needed, and pick out any leaves or twigs. Put the raspberries in a large, wide-rimmed, stainless-steel saucepan or jam pan, add 50ml water and the lemon juice, and soften the fruit over a medium-high heat for about five to seven minutes, stirring frequently so it doesn\u2019t stick to the bottom of the pan and burn. Slowly pour in the sugar, stirring until it dissolves completely, then add the vanilla and cacao nibs. Increase the heat and boil over a high heat for about 10-15 minutes, until it reaches 104C on a thermometer, or the rolling boil turns into heavier, ploppy bubbles. When you think it\u2019s ready, take off the heat and do the wrinkle test: put a quarter-teaspoon of jam on to a pre-frozen plate and put in the fridge for a minute. Remove from the fridge and push the jam with your finger; it should have a slight wrinkle on the surface, similar to when boiled milk forms a skin. If there\u2019s no wrinkle, put the pan back on a high heat, keep cooking and test again every few minutes until the wrinkle has been achieved. When the jam is ready, skim off and discard any froth on the surface, ladle the jam into hot, sterilised jars. Clean the rim of the jar and seal immediately. Strawberry lemon marmalade Prep 15 min Cook 30 min Makes 8 x 228ml jars 5 large unwaxed lemons 2kg strawberries, washed and hulled 250ml lemon juice 900g sugar Sterilise the jars and lids as described above, and put a few small plates in the freezer. Zest the lemons into long strips. If you don\u2019t have the type of zester that can do this, use a vegetable peeler to pare the lemon skin into strips, scrape off any pith with a small, sharp knife, then finely slice into even thinner strips. Set aside 10-12 of the smaller strawberries, then chop the rest into quarters. Put in a large, wide-rimmed, stainless-steel saucepan or jam pan, add 70ml water, the lemon zest and juice, then soften the quartered fruit over a medium-high heat for about 10-15 minutes, stirring frequently so the mixture doesn\u2019t stick to the bottom of the pan and burn. Slowly pour in the sugar, stirring until it dissolves completely, then add the remaining whole strawberries. Increase the heat and boil over a high heat for about 10-15 minutes, until it reaches 104C on a thermometer, or the rolling boil turns into heavier, ploppy bubbles. When you think it\u2019s ready, take off the heat and do the wrinkle test: put a quarter-teaspoon of jam on to a pre-frozen plate and put in the fridge for a minute. Remove from the fridge and push the jam with your finger; it should have a slight wrinkle on the surface, similar to when boiled milk forms a skin.

When the jam is ready, skim off and discard any froth that has formed on the surface, then ladle into hot, sterilised jars. Clean the rim of the jar and seal immediately. Peach and lemon thyme jam Prep 25 min Cook 30 min Makes 8 x 228ml jars 2.5kg peaches 100ml lemon juice 6 sprigs lemon thyme 900g sugar Sterilise the jars and lids as described above, and put a few small plates in the freezer. Cut a small cross in the bottom of each peach and blanch in a large bowl of just-boiled water for five minutes. Drain, peel off the skins, cut the flesh off around the stone, then chop into 1cm pieces. Put the fruit in a large, wide-rimmed, stainless-steel saucepan or jam pan, add the lemon juice and lemon thyme sprigs, and soften the peaches over a medium-high heat for about 10-15 minutes. Stir frequently so they don\u2019t stick to the bottom of the pan and burn. Slowly pour in the sugar, stirring until it dissolves completely. Increase the heat and boil over a high heat for about 10-15 minutes, until it reaches 104C on a thermometer, or the rolling boil turns into heavier, ploppy bubbles. When you think it\u2019s ready, take off the heat and do a wrinkle test for a soft-set jam: put a quarter-teaspoon of jam on to a pre-frozen plate and put in the fridge for one minute. Remove from the fridge and push the jam with your finger; the jam should be heavy and congealed, and when picked up with your finger, it should very slowly drip. If there\u2019s no wrinkle, put the jam back on a high heat, keep cooking and test again every few minutes, until you get that telltale wrinkle. When the jam is ready, skim off and discard any froth from the surface, pick out the lemon thyme stalks, then ladle the jam into the hot, sterilised jars.

According to the Migration Policy Institute, nearly 300,000 immigrants may now face rapid deportation.

Among other issues, critics in the majority-black city point out that flawed facial recognition software misidentifies <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/best-algorithms-struggle-recognize-black-faces-equally/\">people of color</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/why-facial-recognitions-racial-bias-problem-is-so-hard-to-crack/\">women</a> at much higher rates.</p> <p>Detroit also now has the capability to use the technology to monitor residents in real time, though Detroit\u2019s police chief claims it won\u2019t.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/08/facial-recognition-technology-racial-bias-police\">'I think my blackness is interfering': does facial recognition show racial bias?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Willie Burton, a black member of the civilian Detroit Police Commission that oversees the department, noted Detroit\u2019s population is 83% black and that made using the technology especially worrying.</p> <p>\u201cThis should be the last place police use the technology because it can\u2019t identify one black man or woman to another,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery black man with a beard looks alike to it. Every black man with a hoodie looks alike. This is techno-racism.\u201d</p> <p>At a July meeting on the issue held by the police commission, arguments got so heated over facial recognition that officers <a href=\"https://www.metrotimes.com/news-hits/archives/2019/07/12/detroit-cops-arrest-police-commissioner-protester-at-raucous-public-meeting\">arrested and temporarily jailed</a> Burton as he loudly objected to its use.</p> <p>The technology presents obvious questions over whether police are violating residents\u2019 privacy protections. Detroit\u2019s facial recognition software makes it much easier for the city to track people\u2019s movements across time while efficiently and secretly gathering personal information, said Clare Garvie, an author of the report from the Georgetown Law Center on Privacy and Technology.</p> <p>\u201cIt can betray information about sensitive locations \u2013 who someone is as a person, if they\u2019re going to church, an HIV clinic, and the supreme court has said we have a right to privacy even if we are in public,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Garvie conservatively estimates that a quarter of the nation\u2019s 18,000 police agencies now use facial recognition technology, and over half of American adults\u2019 photos are available for investigation.</p> <p>Chicago runs a similar program as that in Detroit, while the Los Angeles police department may be operating a small number of cameras that track the public in real time.</p> <p>Meanwhile, some local governments are proposing regulations to limit it.

      "bodyText": "For the last two years, Detroit police have been quietly utilizing controversial and unreliable facial recognition technology to make arrests in the city. The news, revealed in May in a Georgetown University report , has shocked many Detroiters and sparked a public debate in the city that is still raging and mirrors similar battles playing out elsewhere in America and across the world. Among other issues, critics in the majority-black city point out that flawed facial recognition software misidentifies people of color and women at much higher rates. Detroit also now has the capability to use the technology to monitor residents in real time, though Detroit\u2019s police chief claims it won\u2019t. Willie Burton, a black member of the civilian Detroit Police Commission that oversees the department, noted Detroit\u2019s population is 83% black and that made using the technology especially worrying. \u201cThis should be the last place police use the technology because it can\u2019t identify one black man or woman to another,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery black man with a beard looks alike to it. Every black man with a hoodie looks alike. This is techno-racism.\u201d At a July meeting on the issue held by the police commission, arguments got so heated over facial recognition that officers arrested and temporarily jailed Burton as he loudly objected to its use. The technology presents obvious questions over whether police are violating residents\u2019 privacy protections. Detroit\u2019s facial recognition software makes it much easier for the city to track people\u2019s movements across time while efficiently and secretly gathering personal information, said Clare Garvie, an author of the report from the Georgetown Law Center on Privacy and Technology. \u201cIt can betray information about sensitive locations \u2013 who someone is as a person, if they\u2019re going to church, an HIV clinic, and the supreme court has said we have a right to privacy even if we are in public,\u201d she said. Garvie conservatively estimates that a quarter of the nation\u2019s 18,000 police agencies now use facial recognition technology, and over half of American adults\u2019 photos are available for investigation. Chicago runs a similar program as that in Detroit, while the Los Angeles police department may be operating a small number of cameras that track the public in real time. Meanwhile, some local governments are proposing regulations to limit it. San Francisco and Oakland in California and Cambridge and Somerville in Massachusetts have recently banned the technology. Florida\u2019s Orlando scrapped a pilot real-time surveillance program after the software proved to be unreliable, and New York governor Andrew Cuomo is attempting to implement facial recognition software in New York City with no success, so far. At the federal level, Congress in May held hearings on the issue. Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, whose district includes parts of Detroit, recently introduced legislation that would prohibit its use at public housing. \u201cPolicing our communities has become more militarized and flawed,\u201d Tlaib said during the 22 May hearing. \u201cNow we have for-profit companies pushing so-called technology that has never been tested in communities of color, let alone been studied enough to conclude that it makes our communities safer.\u201d But facial recognition software is just the latest in Detroit\u2019s development of a comprehensive public surveillance apparatus that includes multiple camera programs. As part of its Project Green Light, the city installed nearly 600 high definition cameras at intersections, schools, churches, public parks, immigration centers, addiction treatment centers, apartment buildings, fast food restaurants, and other businesses around the city. Police pull still images from those and thousands of other private cameras, then use facial recognition software to cross-reference them with millions of photos pulled from a mugshot database, driver\u2019s license photos, and images scraped from social media. Were Detroit to start using the software in real time, it could continually scan those entering any location covered by its cameras, or motorists and pedestrians traveling through an intersection, for example. Though there\u2019s no oversight, Detroit police chief James Craig insists the department won\u2019t use real time software and only runs still images as an \u201cinvestigative tool\u201d for violent crimes. Police say any match requires \u201csufficient corroboration\u201d before an arrest can be made. But Garvie notes the software has already lead to false arrests elsewhere in the country. Facial recognition technology\u2019s premise \u201cflips on its head\u201d the idea of innocent until proven guilty, Garvie said at a recent Detroit forum on the topic. \u201cBiometrically identifying everyone and checking them against a watch list or their criminal history assumes they\u2019re guilty until they prove they\u2019re innocent by not having a record,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to make us more secure. It\u2019s going to make us more afraid.\u201d A Detroit police spokesperson couldn\u2019t say how many arrests involved the technology, though Craig told the Guardian no false arrests have been made. He acknowledged issues with accuracy, but stressed that matches are treated as a lead and go through a rigorous review process. \u201cFacial recognition is only part of methodical investigation to identify and confirm that the suspect is involved in that crime,\u201d he said.

But I also think, what\u2019s more impressive than a really good idea done well? A really bad idea done well.\u201d</p> <p>Demetriou\u2019s logic, if you can call it that, has somehow paid off. The show \u2013 which reviewers compared to The Office, although it also has flecks of the surrealist comradery of ensemble shows such as It\u2019s Always Sunny In Philadelphia \u2013 was nominated for two Baftas and recommissioned for a second season, which airs this week.</p> <p>He is right that it really shouldn\u2019t work.

They have a kind of remedial will-they-won\u2019t-they flirting via lobbing bits of rubble around. Natasia explains that it\u2019s not an entirely invented dalliance.</p> <p>\u201c[In real life], Al goes out with [standup comic] <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/mar/10/emma-sidi-funniest-things\">Emma Sidi</a>,\u201d says Natasia. \u201cI truly worship their relationship. But when I was first up in Edinburgh \u2026 I was single at the time and Jamie kept saying: \u2018I want you to go out with Al,\u2019 sending me photos of him from Facebook. So it\u2019s not hard to act like I\u2019m in love with him cos I actually am in love with him a bit in real life \u2013 purely platonic.\u201d</p> <p>It is unusual to see a female lead in a TV comedy who isn\u2019t a kind of \u201cfeisty\u201d character, teasing the boys and disapproving of any kind of fun. \u201cOh, I know,\u201d says Natasia animatedly. \u201c[Writers think] \u2018Ooh, she\u2019s really sassy, she calls the guys on all their bullshit\u2019 \u2013 by which they mean she\u2019s a fucking bore and ruins the fun. I know why it happens, these writers want to write a strong woman, but THAT ISN\u2019T FUNNY. Let women be thick!\u201d</p> <p>We also see more of Katia, Sophie\u2019s equally talentless buddy from dance college, who\u2019s played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jun/18/ellie-white-and-natasia-demetriou-bbc-a-guide-to-making-the-perfect-pop-parody\">Natasia\u2019s comedy partner Ellie White</a>. \u201cWe\u2019re all really obsessed with the fail auditions on early series of Popstars and Pop Idol \u2013 people talking back to the judges when they get rejected, like: \u2018Actually, you\u2019re in the wrong,\u2019\u201d says White. \u201cI think Katia and Sophie have the same sense of delusion as they try to become dancers.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/may/12/natasia-demetriou-people-time-funniest-thing\">Natasia</a> says the characters are partly based on the way she acts slightly braindead when she\u2019s visiting her parents. I wonder if playing the character makes that worse \u2013 do they ever find themselves slipping into Stath and Sophie at the family dinner table? \u201cIt happened when we went on holiday to Greece together, a really romantic holiday, just the two of us,\u201d she explains. \u201cJamie swam out to a little island quite far away and I went over and said: \u2018I\u2019ve come to rescue you Stathy,\u2019 pretending to be a pirate. I think that\u2019s what Sophie would do.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a93987605fdeb25bdaee5218aaa40b213ae7596\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a93987605fdeb25bdaee5218aaa40b213ae7596/0_400_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demetriou with Natasia Demetriou\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demetriou with Natasia Demetriou.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Barnes/channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fans of realism could easily be put off Stath by its pilot episode: there\u2019s a lot of physical comedy and not many obvious gags. But as the first series develops, it becomes quite wonderfully surreal, a world that is both mundane and too stupid to exist. At a time when television is fixated on memoirish sadcoms about loss and betrayal, Stath harks back to the golden era of 90s surrealist comedies such as The Fast Show and I\u2019m Alan Partridge, where society was satirised through exaggeration. You can imagine if Partridge had got into lettings rather than local radio, he may well have ended up working at Michael &amp; Eagle.</p> <p>Jamie wrote some of the first series with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/feb/19/friday-night-dinner-robert-popper\">Robert Popper</a>, who created <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/jun/21/friday-night-dinner-tv-review\">Friday Night Dinner</a>. But whereas that show always hinted at rather than explored its Jewish setting, Jamie really leans into the character\u2019s Greek and Cypriot heritage. \u201cThat\u2019s a voice that\u2019s specific to me and Tash,\u201d says Jamie. \u201cI don\u2019t know about lettings agencies, but I do know about this culture \u2013 its thought processes and warmth. I know about the goodness and funniness. Growing up in England I\u2019ve leant more on my English side, but Stath is what would have happened if I leant more on my Greek side.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn this series, you see that very Greek thing where people will just rock up at anyone\u2019s house and they\u2019ll let you in,\u201d says Natasia. \u201cThat is what our dad does and there\u2019s something so funny about when you do that in England because here there\u2019s a culture when it\u2019s very polite, you book in advance, you pencil in a date. But when we were younger we\u2019d be watching TV on the weekend and then all of a sudden three Greek men show up and just sit in our front room.\u201d</p> <p>Is there ever concern from the Greek community about Stath, one of the few out-and-proud Greeks in British scripted television, being such a moron?</p> <p>\u201cYou hear an occasional thing about the older generation thinking the show is too mocking. But what would they rather? If My Big Fat Greek Wedding was all about a family of the most respectable members of the Greek community, talking normally to each other, it would be the most boring thing in the world. It\u2019s a comedy. I think it\u2019s a celebration of Greekness.\u201d</p> <p>In the first season, the lettings agency was a family concern and Stath was given a free ride by his dad. Season two brings jeopardy with Julian now threatening to kick Stath out the business.</p> <p>\u201cHe just wants to slick the place up. I used to work on Homes Under the Hammer, and the estate agents on that would always have the same walk, with the clipboard and suit,\u201d says Burns. \u201cThis skinny-suit-wearing, no socks-in-the-summer, wheeler-dealery tribe. It\u2019s a very funny target.\u201d</p> <p>Julian has also latched on to Dean, played by Kiell Smith-Bynoe, to try to be his No 2, forcing him to appear in a bizarre promotional video-turned-erotic fiction. \u201cI\u2019ve had more to do and there\u2019s just non-stop gags on set,\u201d says Smith-Bynoe. \u201cI want to be around even for the scenes I\u2019m not in because there\u2019s a real-life Office vibe: someone will put a stapler on their head and we\u2019ll all fall about laughing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e2c00fbd0db7bf0ea31c9e1b102cdca301c629ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2c00fbd0db7bf0ea31c9e1b102cdca301c629ee/1186_0_3200_4000/800.jpg\" alt=\"Stath Lets Flats\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Interviewing Jamie and Natasia, the rhythm of their conversation and the way they make each other laugh is infectious. At one point they go on a lengthy riff about \u201chow they met\u201d, networking on the landing and showing each other their poos.</p> <p>Really, though, I beg during the patter, why do they think they\u2019ve followed the same dream? \u201cDo you mean why are me and Jamie both mad, narcissistic comedians?\u201d jokes Natasia. \u201cWe had such a strange upbringing with such eccentric parents and so we were often put in situations where finding what was funny was a survival thing. Also, we had this ritual with our mum which was jacket potatoes and TV on a Saturday night \u2013 that was The New Adventures of Superman, Blind Date and then whatever the show was [on next]. Big Brother was a religion for Jamie. To a certain extent we just wanted to make people laugh like Darius [Danesh] made us laugh.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps the sweetest part of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/24/would-you-rent-a-flat-from-this-guy-meet-stath-lets-flats-fleabag-bus-rodent-jamie-demetrious-clueless-estate-agent\">Stath Lets Flats</a> is the relationships behind it. Most of these actors have been friends for years, and all of them speak about how grateful they feel for this opportunity. When I leave they stay at the bar, catching up like it\u2019s been years since they last hung out, even though it\u2019s only been a few weeks.</p> <p>\u201cTouch all the wood, long may we be able to work on projects like this,\u201d says Natasia. \u201cI grew up watching Big Train, these collectives of comedians who knew each other, and as a comedy fan you knew who was going out, who were best friends. It\u2019s so rare now to do something like that. I had tears in my eyes every day on set.\u201d For the first time in our conversation she\u2019s not really joking. \u201cThis is was what I dreamed of doing.\u201d</p> <p><em>Stath Lets Flats is on Monday 19 August at 10pm on Channel 4</em></p>",

So it\u2019s not hard to act like I\u2019m in love with him cos I actually am in love with him a bit in real life \u2013 purely platonic.\u201d It is unusual to see a female lead in a TV comedy who isn\u2019t a kind of \u201cfeisty\u201d character, teasing the boys and disapproving of any kind of fun. \u201cOh, I know,\u201d says Natasia animatedly. \u201c[Writers think] \u2018Ooh, she\u2019s really sassy, she calls the guys on all their bullshit\u2019 \u2013 by which they mean she\u2019s a fucking bore and ruins the fun. I know why it happens, these writers want to write a strong woman, but THAT ISN\u2019T FUNNY. Let women be thick!\u201d We also see more of Katia, Sophie\u2019s equally talentless buddy from dance college, who\u2019s played by Natasia\u2019s comedy partner Ellie White. \u201cWe\u2019re all really obsessed with the fail auditions on early series of Popstars and Pop Idol \u2013 people talking back to the judges when they get rejected, like: \u2018Actually, you\u2019re in the wrong,\u2019\u201d says White. \u201cI think Katia and Sophie have the same sense of delusion as they try to become dancers.\u201d Natasia says the characters are partly based on the way she acts slightly braindead when she\u2019s visiting her parents. I wonder if playing the character makes that worse \u2013 do they ever find themselves slipping into Stath and Sophie at the family dinner table? \u201cIt happened when we went on holiday to Greece together, a really romantic holiday, just the two of us,\u201d she explains. \u201cJamie swam out to a little island quite far away and I went over and said: \u2018I\u2019ve come to rescue you Stathy,\u2019 pretending to be a pirate. I think that\u2019s what Sophie would do.\u201d Fans of realism could easily be put off Stath by its pilot episode: there\u2019s a lot of physical comedy and not many obvious gags. But as the first series develops, it becomes quite wonderfully surreal, a world that is both mundane and too stupid to exist. At a time when television is fixated on memoirish sadcoms about loss and betrayal, Stath harks back to the golden era of 90s surrealist comedies such as The Fast Show and I\u2019m Alan Partridge, where society was satirised through exaggeration. You can imagine if Partridge had got into lettings rather than local radio, he may well have ended up working at Michael &amp; Eagle. Jamie wrote some of the first series with Robert Popper, who created Friday Night Dinner. But whereas that show always hinted at rather than explored its Jewish setting, Jamie really leans into the character\u2019s Greek and Cypriot heritage. \u201cThat\u2019s a voice that\u2019s specific to me and Tash,\u201d says Jamie. \u201cI don\u2019t know about lettings agencies, but I do know about this culture \u2013 its thought processes and warmth. I know about the goodness and funniness. Growing up in England I\u2019ve leant more on my English side, but Stath is what would have happened if I leant more on my Greek side.\u201d \u201cIn this series, you see that very Greek thing where people will just rock up at anyone\u2019s house and they\u2019ll let you in,\u201d says Natasia. \u201cThat is what our dad does and there\u2019s something so funny about when you do that in England because here there\u2019s a culture when it\u2019s very polite, you book in advance, you pencil in a date. But when we were younger we\u2019d be watching TV on the weekend and then all of a sudden three Greek men show up and just sit in our front room.\u201d Is there ever concern from the Greek community about Stath, one of the few out-and-proud Greeks in British scripted television, being such a moron? \u201cYou hear an occasional thing about the older generation thinking the show is too mocking. But what would they rather? If My Big Fat Greek Wedding was all about a family of the most respectable members of the Greek community, talking normally to each other, it would be the most boring thing in the world. It\u2019s a comedy. I think it\u2019s a celebration of Greekness.\u201d In the first season, the lettings agency was a family concern and Stath was given a free ride by his dad. Season two brings jeopardy with Julian now threatening to kick Stath out the business. \u201cHe just wants to slick the place up. I used to work on Homes Under the Hammer, and the estate agents on that would always have the same walk, with the clipboard and suit,\u201d says Burns. \u201cThis skinny-suit-wearing, no socks-in-the-summer, wheeler-dealery tribe. It\u2019s a very funny target.\u201d Julian has also latched on to Dean, played by Kiell Smith-Bynoe, to try to be his No 2, forcing him to appear in a bizarre promotional video-turned-erotic fiction. \u201cI\u2019ve had more to do and there\u2019s just non-stop gags on set,\u201d says Smith-Bynoe. \u201cI want to be around even for the scenes I\u2019m not in because there\u2019s a real-life Office vibe: someone will put a stapler on their head and we\u2019ll all fall about laughing.\u201d Interviewing Jamie and Natasia, the rhythm of their conversation and the way they make each other laugh is infectious. At one point they go on a lengthy riff about \u201chow they met\u201d, networking on the landing and showing each other their poos. Really, though, I beg during the patter, why do they think they\u2019ve followed the same dream? \u201cDo you mean why are me and Jamie both mad, narcissistic comedians?\u201d jokes Natasia. \u201cWe had such a strange upbringing with such eccentric parents and so we were often put in situations where finding what was funny was a survival thing. Also, we had this ritual with our mum which was jacket potatoes and TV on a Saturday night \u2013 that was The New Adventures of Superman, Blind Date and then whatever the show was [on next]. Big Brother was a religion for Jamie. To a certain extent we just wanted to make people laugh like Darius [Danesh] made us laugh.\u201d Perhaps the sweetest part of Stath Lets Flats is the relationships behind it. Most of these actors have been friends for years, and all of them speak about how grateful they feel for this opportunity. When I leave they stay at the bar, catching up like it\u2019s been years since they last hung out, even though it\u2019s only been a few weeks. \u201cTouch all the wood, long may we be able to work on projects like this,\u201d says Natasia. \u201cI grew up watching Big Train, these collectives of comedians who knew each other, and as a comedy fan you knew who was going out, who were best friends. It\u2019s so rare now to do something like that. I had tears in my eyes every day on set.\u201d For the first time in our conversation she\u2019s not really joking. \u201cThis is was what I dreamed of doing.\u201d Stath Lets Flats is on Monday 19 August at 10pm on Channel 4",

      "bodyText": "The Whitehall officials responsible for tackling the climate crisis dramatically increased their domestic flights last year despite the huge carbon footprint associated with aviation. Officials from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) took more than 4,500 domestic business flights in the last financial year, according to its annual report. The number of flights taken the year before was fewer than 2,700. The department racked up the extra air miles in the same year that it asked the Committee on Climate Change to map a road towards a net zero carbon economy by 2050. The official climate watchdog warned that there could be only a limited increase in the number of flights taken in the coming decades if the UK is to end its contribution to global heating. Alan Whitehead, the shadow climate change minister, said the department should be \u201csetting the gold standard of net zero compatible behaviour, not flying domestically 4,500 times a year\u201d. \u201cMinisters and officials shirking public transport and lower-carbon travel is how we\u2019ve ended up with an overly expensive railway system,\u201d he added. The figures emerged in the same week the climate activist Greta Thunberg embarked on an ambitious voyage from Plymouth to the US on a zero-carbon, solar-powered yacht to avoid the damaging greenhouse gases emitted during a long-haul flight. Environmental experts have urged the public to fly less, spend longer at their destination and choose lower-emission travel options whenever possible. Doug Parr, the chief climate scientist of Greenpeace, said: \u201cEvery part of the economy needs to be making carbon reductions, and within government one would expect BEIS to take the lead. \u201cThe department has been cutting their flights over the last decade, but last year\u2019s sharp and disappointing uptick in domestic flights is concerning. Flying is an unavoidably high-carbon activity and shouldn\u2019t happen without a real need. \u201cCan this number of domestic flights within a small, developed nation with relatively good surface transport really be necessary?\u201d A government spokeswoman said BEIS was \u201cmaking good progress\u201d towards achieving its goal to cut emissions by two-thirds from their 2010 levels by the end of next year. The department\u2019s total greenhouse gas emissions, including flights, fell below 22,700 tonnes of carbon in the last financial year, down from more than 30,300 tonnes the year before. The emissions reduction is due to a steep fall in the amount of gas used to heat the department after undertaking energy efficiency upgrades to its offices at 10 Victoria Street. BEIS said last year that it would fit double-glazing and a new boiler system to the offices after an investigation by the BBC last summer revealed that its building had the lowest possible energy efficiency ratings. Under a freedom of information request the broadcaster found that four of the 11 offices leased by BEIS received the lowest G rating, while the headquarters in Victoria Street had an E rating.",

But now you are gone, so I will write to you wherever you are \u2013 maybe in the sky somewhere, or in the earth, or just here, by our side.\u201d</p> <p>Reuben was not the only baby who died that week. My new friend Caroline\u2019s daughter, Bethany, was stillborn, too. We met through the online forum of the charity Sands, which supports those affected by stillbirth and neonatal death. Close to 100,000 words rest between us now, via email. We write often, but also stay in touch via WhatsApp and meet in person. \u201cWe are not alone,\u201d we say to each other, \u201cwrestling with motherhood, as it turned out to be.\u201d</p> <p>Our neighbours, writing from the experience of the stillbirth of two of their four children, suggested we shut the world out until we were ready to join in again. It was sound advice, for around every corner sat some form of death-related challenge. First, there was the doctor. \u201cYou\u2019d like to make your six-week postnatal appointment? Ooo, how old is baby now?\u201d My soul fell out of my mouth and I told her he had died. Second, there was the dentist. \u201cWould you mind just filling out this form, including the date that your baby was born.\u201d The form didn\u2019t ask me when my baby had died. Third, there was the pharmacy. \u201cI saw that you read the disclaimer, but could I check you are not pregnant?\u201d he said, looking cautiously at my empty, raised womb. I felt worse for him than for me, for the sincere regret I saw in his eyes as I cried uncontrollably at his till. He apologised. I forgave him.</p> <p> The word-focused algorithms of the internet that dictated the advertising on my social media feeds seemed to be interested only in a living baby. My earlier search terms such as \u201cWhat do you need in your hospital bag?\u201d and \u201cSkin-to-skin after birth\u201d fed me a stream of products for our pending birth, but when I began to search \u201cWhy did my baby die?\u201d nothing changed. Months of baby clothes, equipment and weaning tips followed. No amount of clicking \u201cThis isn\u2019t relevant to me\u201d stemmed the flow.</p> <p>\u201cYou will be for ever changed by this,\u201d wrote one friend, followed by tears over our wedding photos \u2013 a time free from pain. \u201cYou will find a new normal,\u201d she continued, followed by tears at the thought of Christmas in 20 years\u2019 time.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Some of the hardest words I have faced have been those that were absent. We were warned in hospital that this may happen</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I met a lady in the park one day as our dogs chatted incessantly. She said: \u201cI\u2019m off work for six weeks because I broke my wrist.\u201d I replied: \u201cI\u2019m off work, too. I\u2019m on maternity leave, actually, but our baby died, so here I am, walking.\u201d I was not afraid to tell her the truth.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Some of the hardest words I have faced have been those that were absent. We were warned in hospital that this may happen on occasion. To make eye contact with someone you know relatively well, who knows what happened and last saw you heavily pregnant \u2013 to then see them look to the floor and proceed to walk past you or cross over the road \u2013 is hard: it just adds to the depth of loneliness and isolation you already feel. Not everyone knows what to say, or they may feel their presence in your space is insignificant relative to your trauma \u2013 but they are wrong. Their presence is essential within my space. Everyone\u2019s is. Please find some words for me. Simply: \u201cHello \u2013 how are you?\u201d meant fully, or: \u201cI\u2019m sorry about what happened,\u201d even if weeks, months or years have passed since you saw me.</p> <p>Before we knew stillbirth, we too had no words for it. We knew it was possible. It had happened to people we knew. We were afraid of it. How could we find the right words? But as we took the weight of our baby into our arms, his beauty overwhelmed us and the fear that we felt fell silent. They say there are no words for stillbirth, because your baby has died, but there are many words for stillbirth, because your baby was here. We will always speak of Reuben. We will always write his name. He will always be ours, but he will always be gone<em>.</em></p> <p><em>For further information about baby loss, visit <a href=\"http://sands.org.uk\" title=\"\">sands.org.uk</a>.</em></p> <p>\u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email <a href=\"mailto:\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

But now you are gone, so I will write to you wherever you are \u2013 maybe in the sky somewhere, or in the earth, or just here, by our side.\u201d Reuben was not the only baby who died that week. My new friend Caroline\u2019s daughter, Bethany, was stillborn, too. We met through the online forum of the charity Sands, which supports those affected by stillbirth and neonatal death. Close to 100,000 words rest between us now, via email. We write often, but also stay in touch via WhatsApp and meet in person. \u201cWe are not alone,\u201d we say to each other, \u201cwrestling with motherhood, as it turned out to be.\u201d Our neighbours, writing from the experience of the stillbirth of two of their four children, suggested we shut the world out until we were ready to join in again. It was sound advice, for around every corner sat some form of death-related challenge. First, there was the doctor. \u201cYou\u2019d like to make your six-week postnatal appointment? Ooo, how old is baby now?\u201d My soul fell out of my mouth and I told her he had died. Second, there was the dentist. \u201cWould you mind just filling out this form, including the date that your baby was born.\u201d The form didn\u2019t ask me when my baby had died. Third, there was the pharmacy. \u201cI saw that you read the disclaimer, but could I check you are not pregnant?\u201d he said, looking cautiously at my empty, raised womb. I felt worse for him than for me, for the sincere regret I saw in his eyes as I cried uncontrollably at his till. He apologised. I forgave him. The word-focused algorithms of the internet that dictated the advertising on my social media feeds seemed to be interested only in a living baby. My earlier search terms such as \u201cWhat do you need in your hospital bag?\u201d and \u201cSkin-to-skin after birth\u201d fed me a stream of products for our pending birth, but when I began to search \u201cWhy did my baby die?\u201d nothing changed. Months of baby clothes, equipment and weaning tips followed. No amount of clicking \u201cThis isn\u2019t relevant to me\u201d stemmed the flow. \u201cYou will be for ever changed by this,\u201d wrote one friend, followed by tears over our wedding photos \u2013 a time free from pain. \u201cYou will find a new normal,\u201d she continued, followed by tears at the thought of Christmas in 20 years\u2019 time. I met a lady in the park one day as our dogs chatted incessantly. She said: \u201cI\u2019m off work for six weeks because I broke my wrist.\u201d I replied: \u201cI\u2019m off work, too. I\u2019m on maternity leave, actually, but our baby died, so here I am, walking.\u201d I was not afraid to tell her the truth. *** Some of the hardest words I have faced have been those that were absent. We were warned in hospital that this may happen on occasion. To make eye contact with someone you know relatively well, who knows what happened and last saw you heavily pregnant \u2013 to then see them look to the floor and proceed to walk past you or cross over the road \u2013 is hard: it just adds to the depth of loneliness and isolation you already feel. Not everyone knows what to say, or they may feel their presence in your space is insignificant relative to your trauma \u2013 but they are wrong. Their presence is essential within my space. Everyone\u2019s is. Please find some words for me. Simply: \u201cHello \u2013 how are you?\u201d meant fully, or: \u201cI\u2019m sorry about what happened,\u201d even if weeks, months or years have passed since you saw me. Before we knew stillbirth, we too had no words for it. We knew it was possible. It had happened to people we knew. We were afraid of it. How could we find the right words? But as we took the weight of our baby into our arms, his beauty overwhelmed us and the fear that we felt fell silent. They say there are no words for stillbirth, because your baby has died, but there are many words for stillbirth, because your baby was here. We will always speak of Reuben. We will always write his name. He will always be ours, but he will always be gone.

That includes Henry Gross, a member of throwback doo-wop act Sha Na Na who improbably took the stage at the festival on a lineup that mostly featured acts firmly rooted in the relevance of the hippie movement. \u201cJimi Hendrix had a real interest in classic rock and roll music and he loved us, so he dragged Michael Lang to a show and we were booked,\u201d says Gross, who counted the singer as a friend. \u201cWhen I first heard about Woodstock, I didn\u2019t have one thought or another. It was just another gig.\u201d The rock photographer Henry Diltz, known for shooting album covers for the Doors and Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, had the same thought. \u201cI was in my kitchen in Los Angeles when the phone rang and it was [Woodstock lighting director] Chip Monck, who said: \u2018We\u2019re going to have a huge music festival and you should be here,\u2019\u201d remembers Diltz, who was then sent an airline ticket and $500.</p> <p>Two weeks before its 15 August kickoff, Diltz was on the ground in Bethel, New York, with a hundred rolls of black and white and color film at the cow farm owned by Max Yasgur, then a conservative 49-year-old small town dairyman whom Lang and his crew convinced to let them use his property. \u201cI remember watching them build this big wooden stage at the bottom of this green hill of waving alfalfa,\u201d says Diltz of the laid-back vibes before the crowds descended. \u201cWe\u2019d go skinny dipping in the lake and it was like summer camp; sunshine and beautiful afternoons. I was preoccupied photographing everything I looked at.\u201d That peace soon turned to chaos when hundreds of thousands more spectators than expected began to converge on Bethel, causing extreme traffic jams. Lang soon realized that even the basic idea of charging people for entry was a pipe dream. \u201cI realized it was going to be free for everyone when our ticket booths never got put in place,\u201d he remembers. \u201cThere were ideas about maybe passing a basket around, but so many people were coming and it we didn\u2019t want it to become an issue.\u201d (Despite its popularity, the festival actually became a money-losing operation as a result, not turning a profit until years later.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"35f620c0d815eb7d5ad85f9593d125358d152d34\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/35f620c0d815eb7d5ad85f9593d125358d152d34/0_0_3000_2026/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richie Havens onstage, captured by Henry Diltz\" width=\"1000\" height=\"675\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richie Havens onstage, captured by Henry Diltz.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henry Diltz Courtesy PBS Distribution</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI had not watched much TV aside from the moon landing, so the first time I heard about the size of the audience was from our US manager on our journey from the airport to Bethel,\u201d remembers Lyons, whose band, Ten Years After, was a popular British act before Woodstock became their American breakthrough. \u201cWe arrived just in time to catch Joe Cocker\u2019s set and it was quite a spectacle. The organization was hard pressed, and I saw none of the usual backstage facilities.\u201d One memory that\u2019s vivid in Lyons\u2019 mind was a downpour that inundated the property. \u201cThere was nothing anyone could do but wait for it to stop. The stage was slipping down the slope and I heard it had moved 8ft. I think the organizers by this time had come to realize the extent of the potential problems.\u201d</p> <p>Gross, meanwhile, arrived Saturday night and drank Jack Daniels with Hendrix at the local Holiday Inn until sunrise. \u201cIt was a very lucky thing [that it didn\u2019t get dangerous] because it could have been five Altamonts together,\u201d he says, referring to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/may/01/worst-festival-disasters-ever-fyre\">disastrous Rolling Stones-headlined festival</a> later that year. \u201cIt was a twist of fate that one of the [speaker] towers didn\u2019t fall over and land on someone.\u201d Throughout it all, Lang (who says he remained sober throughout the weekend) remained a calm center in a sea of confusion. \u201cThere was so much going on, and so much responsibility, I just needed a clear head. With all that responsibility, you needed to have a calm perspective to keep everyone the same way.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b9b5324a1d4eab014b0060760f8383a9603540ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9b5324a1d4eab014b0060760f8383a9603540ca/0_0_1215_1800/675.jpg\" alt=\"Jimi Hendrix performing at Woodstock\" width=\"675\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jimi Hendrix performing at Woodstock.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henry Diltz/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When it came to the actual performances, the lineup contained some of the biggest names of the day, from Sly and the Family Stone to the protest folk hero Arlo Guthrie and the blues icon Janis Joplin. Santana and John Sebastian both famously performed while tripping on drugs, while the Grateful Dead had to cut their set short when their amps overloaded. When Lyons hit the stage, bass in hand, he describes a treacherous scene. \u201cIt was crisscrossed with cables, in between were rivers of water left by the storm. We considered that we might be electrocuted and joked that if one of us died we\u2019d sell a lot of records.\u201d At one point, his band had to start one song three times to tune their guitars due to the oppressive humidity. \u201cBut the audience remained patient and the energy was electric. Despite our problems we made a connection.\u201d</p> <p>When it came time for Gross and Sha Na Na to hit the stage, the proceedings were so delayed that they didn\u2019t perform until 7.30am that Monday. \u201cI hadn\u2019t slept in a day and a half and had been drinking and whatever else people were doing back then. We kept getting pushed back, so by the time I went on stage we were exhausted. Somebody decided to count very fast tempos, which was a terrific idea.\u201d Once Sha Na Na left the stage, Hendrix closed out the proceedings. Diltz says he was about 20ft to Hendrix\u2019s right, camera in hand. \u201cJimi and his band walked out when dawn had broken and it was quite a sight. Hendrix was obviously amazing, but everything stopped when he played the national anthem. It was surprising and at first I said: \u2018Why\u2019s he doing that? That\u2019s the government\u2019s song and with Vietnam, it represents everything we\u2019re against.\u2019 But a minute later I realized he was taking it back, for us. It felt like we were the Sioux nation filling the valley before they went after Custer. We never knew there was so many of us.\u201d Once everyone left, Diltz remembers that lush green field he enjoyed the week before now looked very different. \u201cIt was a muddy mess of soggy sleeping bags and blankets. It reminded me of one of those Mathew Brady civil war photographs.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"df09650ae21d43a2c1985b3274817d87b1e1d1a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df09650ae21d43a2c1985b3274817d87b1e1d1a6/0_0_6384_4288/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vehicle and pedestrian traffic on the way to Woodstock\" width=\"1000\" height=\"672\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vehicle and pedestrian traffic on the way to Woodstock</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Owen Franken/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Just a year later, both Joplin and Hendrix would be dead and soon the hippie lifestyle would dissipate. But the impact of Woodstock still permeates to this day, whether through the ideas they presented, the stars it made and the legacy it left behind. \u201cIn my view, Woodstock 69 should have never gotten off the ground because of the production calamities,\u201d says Kane of its continuing impact. \u201cThink about the last concert you went to. It\u2019s so structured you can\u2019t even stand on your seat to get a better view. Anything with a crowd is looked at differently now.\u201d Gross, meanwhile, looks back on Woodstock with equal parts annoyance and praise. After all, Sha Na Na\u2019s performance check bounced and they were paid a pittance to be featured in the subsequent blockbuster documentary. \u201cObviously there was great music played by great artists and that\u2019s what people celebrate. But it\u2019s like the country song The Older I Get, The Better I Was,\u201d he says with a laugh. \u201cEvery time I speak the truth to this, I\u2019ll get 100 tweets that I\u2019m a bitter old man. It\u2019s very hard to be honest about this. There were good things and very bad things that came from many dimensions of what happened there.\u201d For Diltz, whose photographs of the festival make up the aptly titled new book Woodstock: 3 Days That Lasted 50 Years (some of which are on display now at the Morrison hotel gallery in New York and Los Angeles) notes that it has become a bigger milestone as more time has gone by. \u201cAt the time, you\u2019re never thinking how will this compare 25 years from now or 50 years from now. It was a sensual experience to be there, but it wasn\u2019t historic.\u201d</p> <p>As for Lang, who later went onto become the face of the festival and its anniversary iterations in 1994 and 1999, most recently became the focus of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/31/woodstock-50-music-festival-officially-cancelled-weeks-before-event\">media snafu that was Woodstock 50</a> and its much-reported snags and missteps. \u201cEvery day, the press was ahead of us,\u201d he says of the experience. \u201cThey were talking about things we hadn\u2019t started to do yet. We\u2019re in that modern age when everything is instantly everywhere and there is a media frenzy around anything that will attract listeners or viewers or readers. So [with the current media culture] I doubt we\u2019d be able to be as stealthy as we were in 1969.\u201d</p> <p>While celebrations are set at the original site this weekend, Lang hints that his own hopes for a 50th anniversary event haven\u2019t died just yet. \u201cIt\u2019s a possibility that we do something closer to the election. That\u2019s something we\u2019re thinking about.\u201d It\u2019s an ongoing project that, like many things, stems from that fateful weekend in 1969. \u201cI think people own Woodstock themselves, as its become something that\u2019s a part of everybody\u2019s life. It represented a moment of hope on the planet. I think that\u2019s why it resonates even 50 years later in such a huge way.\u201d</p>",

We considered that we might be electrocuted and joked that if one of us died we\u2019d sell a lot of records.\u201d At one point, his band had to start one song three times to tune their guitars due to the oppressive humidity. \u201cBut the audience remained patient and the energy was electric. Despite our problems we made a connection.\u201d When it came time for Gross and Sha Na Na to hit the stage, the proceedings were so delayed that they didn\u2019t perform until 7.30am that Monday. \u201cI hadn\u2019t slept in a day and a half and had been drinking and whatever else people were doing back then. We kept getting pushed back, so by the time I went on stage we were exhausted. Somebody decided to count very fast tempos, which was a terrific idea.\u201d Once Sha Na Na left the stage, Hendrix closed out the proceedings. Diltz says he was about 20ft to Hendrix\u2019s right, camera in hand. \u201cJimi and his band walked out when dawn had broken and it was quite a sight. Hendrix was obviously amazing, but everything stopped when he played the national anthem. It was surprising and at first I said: \u2018Why\u2019s he doing that? That\u2019s the government\u2019s song and with Vietnam, it represents everything we\u2019re against.\u2019 But a minute later I realized he was taking it back, for us. It felt like we were the Sioux nation filling the valley before they went after Custer. We never knew there was so many of us.\u201d Once everyone left, Diltz remembers that lush green field he enjoyed the week before now looked very different. \u201cIt was a muddy mess of soggy sleeping bags and blankets. It reminded me of one of those Mathew Brady civil war photographs.\u201d Just a year later, both Joplin and Hendrix would be dead and soon the hippie lifestyle would dissipate. But the impact of Woodstock still permeates to this day, whether through the ideas they presented, the stars it made and the legacy it left behind. \u201cIn my view, Woodstock 69 should have never gotten off the ground because of the production calamities,\u201d says Kane of its continuing impact. \u201cThink about the last concert you went to. It\u2019s so structured you can\u2019t even stand on your seat to get a better view. Anything with a crowd is looked at differently now.\u201d Gross, meanwhile, looks back on Woodstock with equal parts annoyance and praise. After all, Sha Na Na\u2019s performance check bounced and they were paid a pittance to be featured in the subsequent blockbuster documentary. \u201cObviously there was great music played by great artists and that\u2019s what people celebrate. But it\u2019s like the country song The Older I Get, The Better I Was,\u201d he says with a laugh. \u201cEvery time I speak the truth to this, I\u2019ll get 100 tweets that I\u2019m a bitter old man. It\u2019s very hard to be honest about this. There were good things and very bad things that came from many dimensions of what happened there.\u201d For Diltz, whose photographs of the festival make up the aptly titled new book Woodstock: 3 Days That Lasted 50 Years (some of which are on display now at the Morrison hotel gallery in New York and Los Angeles) notes that it has become a bigger milestone as more time has gone by. \u201cAt the time, you\u2019re never thinking how will this compare 25 years from now or 50 years from now. It was a sensual experience to be there, but it wasn\u2019t historic.\u201d As for Lang, who later went onto become the face of the festival and its anniversary iterations in 1994 and 1999, most recently became the focus of the media snafu that was Woodstock 50 and its much-reported snags and missteps. \u201cEvery day, the press was ahead of us,\u201d he says of the experience. \u201cThey were talking about things we hadn\u2019t started to do yet. We\u2019re in that modern age when everything is instantly everywhere and there is a media frenzy around anything that will attract listeners or viewers or readers. So [with the current media culture] I doubt we\u2019d be able to be as stealthy as we were in 1969.\u201d While celebrations are set at the original site this weekend, Lang hints that his own hopes for a 50th anniversary event haven\u2019t died just yet. \u201cIt\u2019s a possibility that we do something closer to the election. That\u2019s something we\u2019re thinking about.\u201d It\u2019s an ongoing project that, like many things, stems from that fateful weekend in 1969. \u201cI think people own Woodstock themselves, as its become something that\u2019s a part of everybody\u2019s life. It represented a moment of hope on the planet. I think that\u2019s why it resonates even 50 years later in such a huge way.\u201d",

Lee\u2019s old-fashioned views were his undoing.</p> <p>\u201cIt was, in some ways, a different culture,\u201d Waller said. \u201cLee didn\u2019t trust spies. They weren\u2019t engaged in \u2018chivalrous war\u2019 so he didn\u2019t think too highly of them.

But Waller steers clear of grandiose claims. \u201cEspionage didn\u2019t win the civil war,\u201d he said, frankly. \u201cThe north had an overwhelming advantage in population and resources and basically wore down the south.</p> <p>\u201cNow, did espionage play a part? Of course, and there were instances on the battlefield where it helped out. There were also instances where it didn\u2019t help out. Even if the south had the best intelligence apparatus and the north had the worst, which was the exact opposite of the case, the north still would have won.\u201d</p> <p>The limitations of espionage were made plain in the immediate aftermath of the war, when John Wilkes Booth slipped into Ford\u2019s Theatre in Washington <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/from-the-archive-blog/2015/apr/14/president-lincoln-assassination-1865\">and assassinated Lincoln</a>. As intelligence failures go, it must rank with the killing of John F Kennedy and the 9/11 terrorist attacks.</p> <p>Waller said: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t breaking news that Lincoln was in danger of being assassinated. He was in danger of being assassinated before he got elected as a candidate. He kept his own file of hate mails and threats. In fact, some people were amazed that he survived this long in the presidency considering the hostility toward him in the south, where people would run ads in the newspaper offering rewards literally for his head, and in the north where there was a lot of pro-Confederate sentiment or criticism of the ways he conducted the war.</p> <p>\u201cHe had very little protection to speak of and didn\u2019t want a Praetorian guard around him. He thought that kept him from the people. It\u2019s amazing he stayed alive as long as he did<em>.\u201d</em></p>",

Lee\u2019s old-fashioned views were his undoing. \u201cIt was, in some ways, a different culture,\u201d Waller said. \u201cLee didn\u2019t trust spies. They weren\u2019t engaged in \u2018chivalrous war\u2019 so he didn\u2019t think too highly of them. He didn\u2019t think too highly of women spies and didn\u2019t think women were capable of taking intelligence. He thought most spies were amateurs and what they produced wasn\u2019t a bunch of value.\u201d \u2018It wasn\u2019t breaking news that Lincoln was in danger\u2019 The president embraced the more modern approach. \u201cLincoln knew how to keep a secret,\u201d Waller says, \u201cand how to operate in secret and he could be ruthless when he when felt he had to be, suspending the writ of habeas corpus, jailing thousands of people and closing down newspapers hostile to his efforts and at one point threatening to disband state legislatures that were going against him.\u201d So how would Lincoln feel about today\u2019s CIA black sites? \u201cThe popular image is \u2018Honest Abe\u2019 would be revolted by it. No. Not necessarily.\u201d The book took nearly five years to write and has been hailed as a major contribution to civil war literature. But Waller steers clear of grandiose claims. \u201cEspionage didn\u2019t win the civil war,\u201d he said, frankly. \u201cThe north had an overwhelming advantage in population and resources and basically wore down the south. \u201cNow, did espionage play a part? Of course, and there were instances on the battlefield where it helped out. There were also instances where it didn\u2019t help out. Even if the south had the best intelligence apparatus and the north had the worst, which was the exact opposite of the case, the north still would have won.\u201d The limitations of espionage were made plain in the immediate aftermath of the war, when John Wilkes Booth slipped into Ford\u2019s Theatre in Washington and assassinated Lincoln. As intelligence failures go, it must rank with the killing of John F Kennedy and the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Waller said: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t breaking news that Lincoln was in danger of being assassinated. He was in danger of being assassinated before he got elected as a candidate. He kept his own file of hate mails and threats. In fact, some people were amazed that he survived this long in the presidency considering the hostility toward him in the south, where people would run ads in the newspaper offering rewards literally for his head, and in the north where there was a lot of pro-Confederate sentiment or criticism of the ways he conducted the war. \u201cHe had very little protection to speak of and didn\u2019t want a Praetorian guard around him. He thought that kept him from the people. It\u2019s amazing he stayed alive as long as he did.\u201d",

The other side of the pincer movement is the purist, who will tell you that listening is not the same as reading, and that 10 hours barely scratches the surface of the modern era\u2019s greatest series of novels. Ignore that advice, too: you should read Proust because it\u2019s a brilliant safari through sex, death and everything in between, but the world won\u2019t end if you don\u2019t. A Proust canap\u00e9 is better than no Proust at all. Even if you don\u2019t go in search of lost time over the bank holiday, whatever it is you choose to become immersed in, surrender to it. Do not scroll through Twitter at the same time, searching for others\u2019 reactions and speed-forming your own. That way lies a life of apoplectically watching Question Time and raging at the dying of the polite. Do not set about refining your to-do lists or making a start on your taxes. If you are caught up in that other traditional bank holiday pastime, taking a rail-replacement bus, perhaps listen on catchup. There are some activities that can prompt a meditative state conducive to deep listening \u2013 ironing sheets is one of them \u2013 but they are not as numerous as wild-eyed multi-taskers would have us believe. Proust himself was the ultimate exponent of the art of taking one\u2019s time, because his subject was time; what it does to us, how it plays tricks on us and how its passage threatens our belief in an easily verified reality. For much of his life, his chosen location for contemplation was bed; his housekeeper once said that she never saw him write even the briefest of notes while standing up, and he preferred above all else to retreat to his cork-lined bedroom. Proust: the prescient enemy of the quantified self, the fleeting gaze, the endlessly active; the champion of brooding and naps. What a guy. Would you really deny him 10 hours of your time? \u2022 Alex Clark writes for the Guardian and the Observer",

      "bodyText": "Chris on Stephanie What were you hoping for? An evening of good company with someone on the same wavelength. First impressions? Down to earth and easy to talk to. What did you talk about? Our best (worst) vomit stories, the fact that Stephanie claims not to get hangovers, making sure your actions support what you want to get out of life, and the danger of wearing white to a burger joint. Any awkward moments? Perhaps when I mistook her Canadian accent for American, which she was very polite about. Good table manners? She deftly handled an egg-based keto burger bun. Best thing about Stephanie? She put me at ease, was unpretentious and talkative. I like a good conversation and while Stephanie said she can be self-conscious about being chatty, I think it\u2019s a real asset. Would you introduce her to your friends? Certainly. Describe Stephanie in three words Calm, brave (for her solo travelling), friendly. What do you think she made of you? Perhaps a little loud, but hopefully interesting. Did you go on somewhere? We just walked each other back to the station, dodging some fairly stealthy pavement cyclists. And... did you kiss? We did not. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? I think there was a lack of romantic spark. Marks out of 10? 7. Would you meet again? I would be very happy to as friends. Stephanie on Chris What were you hoping for? A connection and a unique experience. First impressions? Chris has striking eyes, gave a welcoming smile and a solid, hearty hug. What did you talk about? Our favourite podcasts, cognitive behavioural therapy and mental resilience, drug use, and having a growth mindset. Any awkward moments? None that I recall; though at one point he did say his latest favourite podcast discussed random subjects, one of which was, \u201cWhat if wizards had two buttholes?\u201d Good table manners? Nothing incriminating. Best thing about Chris? He seems like a man of integrity. Would you introduce him to your friends? Yes. He is easy to get on with. He has colourful stories to share and is a good listener. Describe Chris in three words Friendly, driven, respectful. What do you think he made of you? Perhaps a bit distracted (I was so hungry that I really just wanted to order some food and eat before I could speak at length). Did you go on somewhere? No, though I think we were the last people at the restaurant. And... did you kiss? No. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?

      "bodyText": "Ostend, the blowy Belgian resort on the North Sea, has international aspirations and Marvin Gaye, the late prince of Motown, has emerged as central to realising them. In February 1981, struggling with drink and drug dependency and being chased by the IRS over a multimillion-dollar tax bill, the 42-year-old singer-songwriter took the ferry from England to the faded fishing town. He was expected to stay for a few weeks in the family home of the music promoter and hotel owner Freddy Cousaert. But Gaye ended up living in the down-at-heel resort for nearly 18 months, during which he penned one of his biggest hits, Sexual Healing, from his seafront rooms at the Residence Jane apartment block. Gaye would have turned 80 this April. He was shot dead by his father, a Pentecostal preacher, the day before his 45th birthday \u2013 barely 18 months after leaving Belgium\u2019s shores. On the back of that poignant anniversary, a \u201cwalkumentary\u201d that is available for visiting Gaye fans, during which they can visit the star\u2019s hideouts while watching original footage on an iPod of him in the town, has had a 10% rise in takers in the first six months of this year compared with the same period in 2018. But Ostend\u2019s tourist board thinks there is a much bigger market to tap into. News that the record producer, rapper and business mogul Dr Dre has acquired the film rights and the rights to Gaye\u2019s musical catalogue, with the approval of the family estate, has set hares running.

Some key links and developments from the day: New York City\u2019s chief medical examiner confirmed that Jeffrey Epstein died as a result of suicide by hanging following days of speculation and spreading conspiracy theories. Trump met with senior officials to discuss a gradual withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan. A federal appeals court narrowed an injunction on the Trump administration\u2019s asylum restrictions, ruling that the policy could go into effect in Texas and New Mexico. California and a group of not-for-profit organizations filed two more lawsuits against the administration\u2019s \u201cpublic charge rule\u201d, which penalized green-card applicants who use public benefits. Representative Rashida Tlaib said she would not travel to Israel after the country said it would allow her visit if she agreed not to discuss her support of the movement to boycott Israel. Two unidentified women filed a sexual abuse lawsuit in a Manhattan district court against the estate of Jeffrey Epstein. Ghislaine Maxwell was photographed at a restaurant in Los Angeles, the first time she has been seen in public since the death of the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. Thousands of travelers at major US airports faced congested terminals and long lines due to a temporary computer outage that affected the US Customs and Border Protection\u2019s (CBP) processing systems. The Trump administration submitted a brief to the Supreme Court arguing that transgender people should not be protected by a key federal anti-discrimination law. The president says he is dining tonight with Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s CEO: A reminder of how the president addressed Cook earlier this year: Some Democratic members of Congress are now considering action against emissaries of the Israeli government and the Trump administration over Israel\u2019s widely criticized decision to block two American congresswomen from entering the country, according to a Miami Herald report: The newspaper reported that roughly a dozen lawmakers, including senior Jewish members, were discussing a possible statement of no confidence in Israel\u2019s ambassador to Washington and the US ambassador to Israel. Our earlier coverage: The Trump administration has submitted a brief to the Supreme Court this afternoon arguing that transgender people should not be protected by a key federal anti-discrimination law: The Justice Department\u2019s brief argues that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits sex discrimination, should not include trans people. That means, the Trump administration is pushing to abandon existing protections for trans people, which would, at the federal level, legalize firing workers simply because they are trans. Here\u2019s the response from Sarah Warbelow, legal director of the Human Rights Campaign (HRC): The Trump-Pence administration\u2019s filing today is both legally and morally unjustifiable. Their argument is un-American, anti-business, and flies in the face of decades of federal case law, including established Supreme Court precedent. There can be no justification for such a narrow interpretation of the term \u2018sex.\u2019 Our community will not be silent, and we will not be erased. HRC and other civil rights organizations have long argued that LGBTQ people are protected under existing \u201csex discrimination\u201d laws, which federal courts have repeatedly affirmed. The anti-discrimination laws carry implications for employment, housing, healthcare, education and more. The medical examiner\u2019s statement on Epstein\u2019s death was brief, saying the determination of suicide came \u201cafter careful review of all investigative information, including complete autopsy findings\u201d. Here\u2019s the full release: And here\u2019s a relevant thread about the Washington Post\u2019s earlier coverage on the findings that Epstein had broken bones, which had fueled speculation and questions about the cause of death. Read the full story on the medical examiner\u2019s report here: The president has tweeted, without any comment, a video of himself saying he will \u201cnever bow to a foreign nation\u201d. The tweet comes after a meeting with top advisers about possible troop withdrawal from Afghanistan. In the clip, the president said: I love of our country. I\u2019m the president of the United States of America. I\u2019m not the president of the world. And as long as I\u2019m president, America will never bow to a foreign nation like we were for so many years. Hello - Sam Levin in Los Angeles here, taking over our live coverage for the rest of the day on this busy Friday. The computer system of US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is apparently down, causing major problems at international airports in Los Angeles, New York and elsewhere, officials said: CBP described it as a \u201ctemporary outage\u201d, saying the agency was using \u201calternative procedures\u201d until the systems were back online. Kennedy airport in New York tweeted, \u201cCustoms is experiencing a system shutdown nationwide. They are processing passengers manually until the system comes back online.\u201d That\u2019s it from me this week. I\u2019m turning the blog over to my West Coast colleague Sam Levin for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: New York City\u2019s chief medical examiner confirmed that Jeffrey Epstein died as a result of suicide by hanging, shutting down many conspiracy theories to the contrary. Trump is meeting with senior officials to discuss a gradual withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan, despite concerns that such a move could disrupt American counterterrorism operations in the region. A federal appeals court narrowed an injunction on the Trump administration\u2019s asylum restrictions, ruling that the policy could go into effect in the border states of Texas and New Mexico. California and a group of non-profits filed two more lawsuits against the administration\u2019s \u201cpublic charge rule,\u201d which penalizes green-card applicants who use public benefits. Representative Rashida Tlaib decided she would not travel to Israel despite the country\u2019s announcement that it would allow her to visit as long as she agreed not to discuss her support of the movement to boycott Israel. Tlaib said she would not concede to such restrictions, which she slammed as an effort to humiliate her. Sam will have more on the Epstein case and Trump\u2019s Afghanistan meeting, so stay tuned. In the hours after Epstein\u2019s death was reported, Trump was among the many people spreading conspiracy theories about the now-confirmed suicide, resharing a tweet suggesting that Bill and Hillary Clinton may have been involved. The president was quickly denounced for spreading the conspiracy theory, but he defended his actions while speaking to reporters on Tuesday. \u201cThe retweet \u2014 which is what it was, just a retweet \u2014 was from somebody that\u2019s a very respected conservative pundit, so I think that was fine,\u201d Trump said, adding that he had \u201cno idea\u201d whether the Clintons played a role in Epstein\u2019s death. A spokesperson for the former president responded to Trump\u2019s initial retweet by suggesting he should be removed from office. The Washington Post was the first outlet to report yesterday that Epstein broke several bones in his neck, including the hyoid bone. Such a bone break is possible in suicides but is more consistently associated with homicide or strangulation, a fact that the Post\u2019s story emphasized. But CNN spoke to multiple medical experts who downplayed the neck injuries, arguing that such bone breaks are consistent with a suicide by hanging for a man of Epstein\u2019s age. \u201cThe presence of other broken bones in his neck, from a guy hanging 66 years old, is very consistent with suicidal hanging,\u201d said Gerald Rodts, chief of spinal surgery at the Emory Clinic. Bill Lloyd, a surgeon board-certified in ophthalmology and anatomic pathology, added, \u201cYou can twist the hyoid bone theory to tell whatever story you want to tell. It just gives naysers the ability to advance whatever conspiracy theories they want to tell.\u201d New York City\u2019s chief medical examiner said that the autopsy of financier and alleged sex-trafficker Jeffrey Epstein revealed he died as a result of suicide by hanging. The AP reports: Epstein, 66, was found dead in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City on Aug. 10, touching off outrage and disbelief over how such a high-profile prisoner, known for socializing with powerful people including presidents Donald Trump and Bill Clinton, could have gone unwatched. The Bureau of Prisons said Epstein had apparently killed himself, but that didn\u2019t squelch conspiracy theories about his death. ... The Washington Post and The New York Times reported Thursday that the autopsy revealed that several bones in Epstein\u2019s neck had been broken, leading to speculation his death was a homicide. Chief Medical Examiner Barbara Sampson issued a statement Thursday in response to those articles, saying: \u2018In all forensic investigations, all information must be synthesized to determine the cause and manner of death. Everything must be consistent; no single finding can be evaluated in a vacuum.\u2019 The White House said Trump would donate his second-quarter salary to the office of the surgeon general to fund an upcoming public health advisory. Trump said during the 2016 campaign that he would not accept his $400,000 annual salary, instead opting to donate the money back to various areas of the government. Previous recipients of the president\u2019s salary donations have varied from the Small Business Administration to the Department of Transportation. But Trump has previously been criticized for donating to agencies whose budgets he has simultaneously proposed cutting, such as the National Park Service. Democratic presidential candidate Juli\u00e1n Castro has released another ad that delivers a scathing, straight-to-camera condemnation of Trump\u2019s leadership. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that your presidency is failing,\u201d Castro says in the ad \u2060\u2014 going on to slam Trump for worsening drug prices, immigration and the deficit. \u201cNot a lot to run on there. \u201cSo you\u2019re trying to distract us and divide us with dangerous and hateful rhetoric,\u201d Castro continues. \u201cI won\u2019t be distracted.\u201d The former San Antonio mayor released a similar ad earlier this week blaming Trump for intensifying US racism, which he said had led to the mass shooting in El Paso. It played during Fox News programming in Bedminster, New Jersey, ensuring the president would see it. Castro remains one poll away from making the cut for the fall debate stage and has less than two weeks to qualify. The chair of the Federal Elections Commission said the agency\u2019s Republican members had shut down an effort to further investigate Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election by funneling money to the National Rifle Association. McClatchy reported last year that the FBI was investigating whether former Moscow banker Alexander Torshin had used the NRA to illegally influence the campaign as the lobbying group spent a record $30 million supporting Trump\u2019s candidacy. That report came shortly before gun-rights activist Maria Butina, who spent years cozying up to the NRA, pleaded guilty to being a Russian influence agent. In her plea agreement, she admitted to attempting to \u201cestablish unofficial lines of communication with Americans having power and influence over US politics.\u201d The NRA\u2019s connections to Torshin and Butina have raised questions about the group\u2019s ties to Russia as it simultaneously undergoes major leadership turnover. Trump held a conference call on Wednesday with three Wall Street CEOs as US stocks took their worst hit of the year. CNBC reports: Trump held the call with J.P. Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, Bank of America\u2019s Brian Moynihan and Citigroup\u2019s Michael Corbat, according to people with knowledge of the situation. The Dow plunged 800 points, or 3%, in its worst day of the year on Wednesday amid a recession warning from the bond market. The president asked the three men to give him a read on the health of the U.S. consumer, according to one of the people. The executives responded that the consumer is doing well, but that they could be doing even better if issues including the China-U.S. trade war were resolved, this person said. Representative Jim Jordan, a Republican congressman and Trump ally, argued against red flaw laws in response to a story about the House judiciary committee holding a September hearing on several gun bills. Red flag laws, already enacted in 17 states and the District of Columbia, allow judges to take guns away from people deemed to be dangerous. Trump has voiced support for such laws, but some of his allies have pushed back against the idea. For example, Jordan\u2019s tweet echoes a talking point from the National Rifle Association, who warned last week that no one should have their guns confiscated without \u201cdue process.\u201d Congressional Republicans have circulated a memo falsely describing the El Paso shooting, carried out by a man spewing white supremacist views, as \u201cviolence from the left.\u201d The Tampa Bay Times reports: A document obtained by the Tampa Bay Times and sent by House Republicans provides a framework for how to respond to anticipated questions like, \u2018Why won\u2019t you pass legislation to close the \u2018gun show loophole\u2019 in federal law?\u2019 and \u2018Why shouldn\u2019t we ban high-capacity magazines?\u2019 The answers are boilerplate Republican arguments against tougher gun restrictions. But it also included this question: \u2018Do you believe white nationalism is driving more mass shootings recently?\u2019 The suggested response is to steer the conversation away from white nationalism to an argument that implies both sides are to blame. \u2018White nationalism and racism are pure evil and cannot be tolerated in any form,\u2019 the document said. \u2018We also can\u2019t excuse violence from the left such as the El Paso shooter, the recent Colorado shooters, the Congressional baseball shooter, Congresswoman Giffords\u2019 shooter and Antifa.\u2019 A spokesperson for a Republican congressman claimed that the inclusion of El Paso was a mistake and that it was meant to refer to the Dayton shooting. But the motivation of the Dayton attacker is much less clear than that of the El Paso shooter, who posted an anti-immigrant screed online shortly before killing 22 people. Barack Obama reportedly expressed concerns to Joe Biden earlier this year about the former vice president\u2019s plans to launch a White House bid. The New York Times reports: The two men spoke at least a half dozen times before Mr. Biden decided to run, and Mr. Obama took pains to cast his doubts about the campaign in personal terms. \u2018You don\u2019t have to do this, Joe, you really don\u2019t,\u2019 Mr. Obama told Mr. Biden earlier this year, according to a person familiar with the exchange. Mr. Biden \u2014 who thinks he could have defeated Donald Trump four years ago \u2014 responded by telling Mr. Obama he could never forgive himself if he turned down a second shot at Mr. Trump. But Obama has since warmed up to Biden\u2019s presidential campaign\u2060 \u2014 even going so far as to request a briefing from the candidate\u2019s team before he officially launched his bid. Trump spoke by phone with Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Imran Khan, \u201cto discuss regional developments and to follow up on the Prime Minister\u2019s successful visit to Washington, D.C., last month,\u201d the White House said in a statement. \u201cThe President conveyed the importance of India and Pakistan reducing tensions through bilateral dialogue regarding the situation in Jammu and Kashmir,\u201d the statement added. \u201cThe two leaders further discussed how they will continue to build on the growing relationship between the United States and Pakistan and the momentum created during their recent meeting at the White House.\u201d While Khan was visiting the White House last month, Trump said of the war in Afghanistan, \u201cI have plans on Afghanistan that if I wanted to win that war, Afghanistan would be wiped off the face of the earth, it would be over in literally in 10 days and I don\u2019t want to do that -- I don\u2019t want to go that route.\u201d The president is reportedly meeting with senior officials in New Jersey today to discuss a gradual withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan. The Israeli newspaper owned by Republican megadonor Sheldon Adelson went with this headline to cover the fallout over blocking Tlaib and Omar\u2019s travel, per a Politico reporter: Democratic presidential candidate Steve Bullock trolled Trump over reports that he has inquired about the US purchasing Greenland. The Montana governor\u2019s tweet links to a website kindly informing visitors that Greenland is not for sale and asking them to donate to his campaign. (Bullock has not yet hit the 130,000 required donors to make the fall debate stage.) Representative Ilhan Omar, one of two congresswomen blocked from entering Israel, pushed back on claims from the country\u2019s prime minister that the lawmakers did not schedule any meetings with Israeli officials. In a Twitter thread, the Minnesota Democrat outlined the stops that she and Representative Rashida Tlaib planned to make while visiting the region. A group of nonprofits and California have separately sued the Trump administration over its proposed rule to penalize green-card applicants who use public benefits. Nine nonprofits serving immigrant communities \u2060argued in their lawsuit that the \u201cpublic charge rule\u201d was an unconstitutional effort to discriminate against nonwhite immigrants. Xavier Becerra, California\u2019s Democratic attorney general, said the rule \u201cwould force working parents and families across the nation to forego basic necessities like food, housing and healthcare out of fear.\u201d The lawsuits are only the latest challenges to the rule, which was announced on Monday. A group of 13 attorneys general, led by Washington\u2019s Robert Ferguson, filed a lawsuit on Wednesday, and representatives for Santa Clara County and San Francisco are seeking a temporary injunction to block the policy. The San Francisco-based Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal ruled that a trial judge was wrong to impose a nationwide injunction on harsh Trump administration rules restricting asylum applications from Central American immigrants. Under the policy, asylum applications are effectively barred from Central American immigrants who pass through another country before reaching the United States. The federal appeals court ruled that the administration had not sufficiently showed the policy was lawful, and thus it could not be implemented within the West Coast circuit, which includes the border states of California and Arizona. But the court also decided that the injunction on the restrictions could not apply to states outside the circuit, namely Texas and New Mexico. The conservative LGBT group Log Cabin Republicans has chosen to endorse Trump\u2019s re-election bid after declining to support his 2016 campaign. The group\u2019s chairman and vice chairwoman, Robert Kabel and Jill Homan, write in a Washington op-ed: For LGBTQ Republicans, watching the 2016 GOP convention before Donald Trump took the stage was like a dream fulfilled. The distance between that event and Pat Buchanan\u2019s hate-filled exhortation against the LGBTQ community in Houston in 1992 is a powerful measurement of how far we\u2019ve come. ... [S]ince taking office, President Trump has followed through on many of his commitments to the United States, including taking bold actions that benefit the LGBTQ community. ... While we do not agree with every policy or platform position presented by the White House or the Republican Party, we share a commitment to individual responsibility, personal freedom and a strong national defense. ... To be treated equally, fairly and justly under the law is our goal, and we know that \u201cInclusion Wins\u201d is a mantra we share with the president. The Log Cabin Republicans endorse Donald Trump for reelection as president. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Representative Rashida Tlaib announced she would not travel to Israel at this time after officials there said she could visit if she agreed not to speak out about her support of the movement to boycott Israel. Tlaib said she would not concede to such restrictions, which she denounced as an attempt to humiliate her. Trump is meeting with senior officials in New Jersey to discuss a gradual withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan. But worries persist that the move will complicate America\u2019s counterterrorism operations in the region. Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke released his plan to license guns and enforce a mandatory buyback program of assault weapons, a sweeping proposal that goes further than most of his 2020 opponents. The blog is still covering the latest from Trump\u2019s meeting on Afghanistan and reaction to Tlaib\u2019s announcement, so stay tuned. Mitch McConnell underwent surgery yesterday to repair a shoulder fracture he suffered earlier this month. The Senate majority leader sustained the injury in a fall at his Louisville home and has been recovering in Kentucky during the August recess. Another House Democrat, Representative Anthony Brown of Maryland, announced his support for launching an impeachment inquiry against Trump. Brown becomes the 126th House Democrat to back launching impeachment proceedings, according to Politico\u2019s count. A majority of the Democratic caucus now supports impeachment, putting pressure on Nancy Pelosi to take up the issue when the House returns next month. A senior official told CBS News that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is in New Jersey to meet with Trump about the plan to gradually withdraw US troops from Afghanistan. The secretary\u2019s official schedule today just said he had no public appointments. And a Washington Post reporter said the commander of US forces in Afghanistan is supportive of a partial withdrawal to maintain a counterterrorism presence: The House judiciary committee has announced it will hold a hearing on several gun bills when lawmakers return to Capitol Hill next month. The Sept. 4 hearing will include consideration of a ban on high-capacity magazines, an expansion of background checks and red flag legislation. But even if the bills pass the Democratic-controlled House, they are unlikely to make it through the Republican-controlled Senate and even less likely to be signed into law by Trump. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, has consistently refused to commit to taking up gun legislation in the wake of the El Paso and Dayton shootings. Trump has repeatedly said McConnell supports expanding background checks, but the Kentucky Republican himself has made no such admission. A new poll showed that Joe Biden is still leading the field of Democratic presidential candidates, although his lead has narrowed. According to the Fox News poll, Biden retains the support of 31 percent of Democratic primary voters, 11 points ahead of Elizabeth Warren at 20 percent. The poll also found 10 percent of voters supporting Bernie Sanders and another 8 percent backing Kamala Harris. Biden and Harris\u2019 levels of support are the same that they were in Fox\u2019s March poll. But in that same time, Sanders has lost ground while Warren has picked up significant speed. Sanders has dropped 13 points, and Warren has seen a 16-point increase. The poll also found all four of the top-polling Democrats beating Trump in a hypothetical general election, with Biden once again leading the pack. The poll found the former vice president would defeat Trump by 12 points in a potential match-up, which Biden\u2019s camp rushed to boast about. One of Trump\u2019s congressional allies, Senator Lindsey Graham, urged the president to carefully consider the ramifications of withdrawing US troops from Afghanistan as he prepared for a meeting with advisers to discuss such a move. \u201cAny peace agreement which denies the US robust counter-terrorism capability in Afghanistan is NOT a peace deal,\u201d the South Carolina Republican warned. \u201cInstead, it is paving the way for another attack on the American homeland and attacks against American interests around the world.\u201d Trump is expected to meet with senior officials in New Jersey today to map out a gradual withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan. The Washington Post reports: The session will review results of months of diplomatic outreach by Trump\u2019s special envoy, former U.S. Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad, and military plans to begin a phased withdrawal of U.S. forces and end the longest U.S. war. The Trump administration would withdraw thousands of troops from Afghanistan in exchange for concessions from the Taliban, including a cease-fire and a renunciation of al-Qaeda, as part of an initial deal to end the nearly 18-year-old war. The agreement would require the Taliban to begin negotiating a larger peace deal directly with the Afghan government, a sticking point that has left the U.S.-allied Kabul government fearful that Trump is abandoning them. Khalilzad has publicly assured Kabul that the U.S. will not \u2018cut and run,\u2019 but Trump alarmed the Afghans by saying last month that he could end the war \u2018in a week\u2019 by dropping huge bombs, but would not do so. The withdrawal U.S. officials plan to present to Trump could cut the number of American troops in the country from roughly 14,000 to between 8,000 and 9,000, said the officials, who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. That number would be nearly the same as when Trump took office. Trump has reached out the man whom he mocked as overweight during his New Hampshire rally last night. Despite initial indications that the man was there to protest the president, the White House said he turned out to be a Trump supporter. After a protester appeared to interrupt Trump\u2019s speech last night, the president said, \u201cThat guy has got a serious weight problem. Go home, start exercising.\u201d (Ironically, this came moments before Trump told the crowd, \u201cOur movement is built on love.\u201d) But it appears the man Trump was referring to was actually one of his supporters. The White House said the president had left a voicemail for the man while flying back to Washington on Air Force One. Trump\u2019s own weight attracted headlines earlier this year, when his annual physical revealed he had officially become obese. Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has released a new plan to aid Native Americans and bolster tribal rights. The plan includes draft legislation written with Representative Deb Haaland, one of the first two Native women elected to Congress who recently endorsed Warren. It calls for funding critical programs for Native Americans and creating a cabinet-level White House Council on Native American Affairs, among other initiatives. \u201cWe must recommit to the principles of protecting Tribal sovereignty and advancing Tribal self-determination in all federal decisions that affect Native communities,\u201d Warren wrote in a Medium post. \u201cI have fought for this brighter future during my time in the Senate. And I am committed to achieving it as President of the United States.\u201d The proposal does not mention Warren\u2019s past claims of Native American ancestry, which have been a recurring point of criticism against the presidential candidate. Trump has sought to capitalize on the controversy by giving Warren the racist nickname of \u201cPocahontas.\u201d Just last night at his New Hampshire campaign rally, the president said he hoped to resurrect the issue. \u201cI did the Pocahontas thing,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI hit her really hard and it looked like she was down and out but that was too long ago, I should\u2019ve waited. But don\u2019t worry, we will revive it.\u201d A foreign policy adviser to Bernie Sanders hit back against a growing talking point against Tlaib after the congresswoman decided not to visit Israel under the government\u2019s conditions: Tlaib\u2019s grandmother, Muftiyah Tlaib, said she was \u201cproud\u201d of her granddaughter after getting into a diplomatic spat with Israel. \u201cI am proud of her,\u201d the elder Tlaib told the Washington Post. \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t be proud of a granddaughter like that? I love her and am so proud of her.\u201d Tlaib\u2019s grandmother lives in the village of Beit Ur al-Fauqa in the West Bank, about 15 miles from Jerusalem. She said she didn\u2019t understand why her granddaughter, as a US congresswoman, should not be allowed to visit her family. \u201cShe\u2019s in a big position and she cannot visit her grandmother,\u201d she said. \u201cSo what good is the position?\u201d Ashraf Samara, the head of the village council, said the conflict between Israel and Tlaib was reflective of many Palestinians\u2019 experience in the West Bank. \u201cThis is all very strange for the media,\u201d Samara told the Post. \u201cBut not for me as a Palestinian because I know the reality of occupation.\u201d Israel\u2019s interior minister responded to Tlaib\u2019s announcement by claiming she allowed \u201cher hate for Israel\u201d to outweigh \u201cher love for her grandmother.\u201d The official also interestingly tagged Trump\u2019s Twitter handle in the message, indicating Israel may be hoping for back-up from the president after Tlaib\u2019s latest announcement. Tlaib was facing pressure from Palestinians and their supporters to abandon plans for the trip amid complaints that acquiescing to Israel\u2019s demands would weaken her stance on the issue. The chair of the board that sponsored Tlaib and Omar\u2019s initial trip emphasized that a \u201chumanitarian\u201d visit would not make up for Israel blocking their travel: The leaders of the movement to boycott Israel applauded Tlaib for not bowing to Israel\u2019s conditions: An Israeli journalist and activist said this before Tlaib announced her decision to cancel the trip: Al Jazeera\u2019s former correspondent for the West Bank replied: Tlaib has issued a longer statement condemning Israel\u2019s behavior toward her and confirming that she will not travel to visit her family in the West Bank at this time. \u201cIn my attempt to visit Palestine, I\u2019ve experienced the same racist treatment that many Palestinian-Americans endure when encountering the Israeli government,\u201d Tlaib said. \u201cI have therefore decided not to travel to Palestine and Israel at this time. \u201cVisiting my grandmother under these oppressive conditions meant to humiliate me would break my grandmother\u2019s heart.\u201d Tlaib said last night after a town hall in her Michigan district that she thought Israel had made a \u201chuge error\u201d in blocking her entry to the country. The congresswoman emphasized that her primary goal was to see her grandmother. \u201cMy grandmother is in her 90\u2019s,\u201d Tlaib said. \u201cHer granddaughter is a United States congresswoman. She should be able to see me, to touch me, to hug me. And so I\u2019m going to continue to fight back.\u201d Tlaib added that despite Israel\u2019s reputation as a democratic country, \u201cit\u2019s very obvious that they\u2019re trying to limit what I do when I get there.\u201d The letter that Tlaib sent to the Israeli interior minister requesting permission to visit her grandmother is dated yesterday and specifically states she would \u201crespect any restrictions\u201d and \u201cnot promote boycotts against Israel during my visit.\u201d But in her tweet thread this morning, Tlaib said that visiting under \u201cthese oppressive conditions stands against everything I believe in--fighting against racism, oppression &amp; injustice.\u201d Representative Rashida Tlaib indicated in a Twitter thread that she would not visit her family in the West Bank, despite Israel\u2019s announcement that it would approve her travel on \u201chumanitarian\u201d grounds. \u201cI have decided that visiting my grandmother under these oppressive conditions stands against everything I believe in--fighting against racism, oppression &amp; injustice,\u201d Tlaib wrote. The freshman congresswoman was originally set to arrive in Israel on Sunday, but that was thrown into question when Israeli officials announced yesterday that it would block the entry of Tlaib and her colleague, Representative Ilhan Omar, over their past criticism of Israel. But Israel said today that Tlaib had written a letter requesting to see her grandmother and promising not to express certain views while in the country. \u201cThis could be my last opportunity to see her. I will respect any restrictions and will not promote boycotts against Israel during my visit,\u201d Tlaib was quoted as saying. It\u2019s unclear what caused the lawmaker to change her mind. Happy Friday, live blog readers! One day after returning to the campaign trail, Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke is out with a proposal to license guns and enforce a mandatory buyback program for assault weapons, a bold plan that goes further than most of his 2020 opponents. The policy announcement is a tragically fitting return to presidential politicking for the former congressman, who took nearly two weeks off from the campaign trail to comfort his hometown of El Paso as it mourned the 22 community members lost in a recent mass shooting. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s mandatory buyback plan could mark a turn in gun politics \u2014 even though only other candidate, Kirsten Gillibrand, has voiced support for a similar program. For years, Democrats avoided such proposals out of fear of being hit with Republican accusations that liberals were \u201ccoming to take your guns\u201d. But after yet another mass shooting and dozens more lives lost, that calculus could be changing. Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping its eye on: Donald Trump is still on vacation in New Jersey and is retweeting compliments from his advisers about his campaign rally last night. Multiple presidential candidates \u2013 including Pete Buttigieg, Cory Booker and Juli\u00e1n Castro \u2013 are in Georgia for the Black Church Presidential Candidate Conversation Series. Joe Biden is in his home state of Delaware. The blog is covering all of that, so stay tuned.",
