The original <a href=\"https://insidestory.org.au/who-missed-out-on-the-abc-board/\">freedom of information request</a> was lodged in October 2017.</p> <p>The Department of Communications and the Arts refused to release the names, initially claiming they were exempt cabinet documents and that their release would be an unreasonable breach of personal privacy \u2013 although all but one of the people on the list said they had no objection to their names being made public.</p> <p>The department also claimed that the names would reveal deliberative processes and that this was against the public interest.</p> <p>The cabinet documents claim was dropped at the first stage of appeal. After intervention by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, a single name was released earlier this year \u2013 that of Georgie Somerset, whose name was already public, given that she had been appointed.</p> <p>Finally, earlier this month, the acting Australian information commissioner, Elizabeth Hampton, overturned the department\u2019s decision and ordered the release of the names.</p> <p>Hampton took into account public controversy over the appointments process for the ABC board, particularly following allegations of political interference. She said <a href=\"http://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/AICmr/2019/55.html\">in her decision</a> that the release would \u201cfurther increase transparency and scrutiny of the minister\u2019s decision\u201d.</p> <p>While the battle over the request took place, government interference in ABC board appointments became a white hot issue following the September 2018 sacking of managing director Michelle Guthrie amid allegations the board had failed to protect her from political interference by chairman Justin Milne.</p> <p>Milne resigned a few days later, and in February this year was replaced by Buttrose as a direct pick of the prime minster, Scott Morrison. While her appointment was widely welcomed, she had not applied through the arm\u2019s length process, meaning another set of candidates was set aside in her favour. Some of them are known to be extremely dissatisfied at their treatment.</p> <p>In April, a Senate inquiry resulting from the crisis over Michelle Guthrie\u2019s sacking recommended that the appointments process should be transparent and directors have media experience, and that the minister should consult the opposition before choosing board members.</p> <p>Contacted for comment last night, Shaun Brown said he had applied in 2017 after being urged to do so by the recruitment agency.

Documents released under freedom of information legislation show that in February 2017, the government rejected singer, writer and director Robyn Archer, former managing director of SBS Shaun Brown, and Sandra Levy, former chief executive of the Australian Film, Television and Radio School. They were on a list of eight names recommended by an independent nomination panel after an extensive application and vetting process. The then communications minister, Mitch Fifield, instead appointed the chair of the Minerals Council of Australia, Vanessa Guthrie. Guthrie had no media experience. At the time, the ABC was facing constant government criticism over its reporting on the coalmining industry and energy security. Guthrie had also been through the application process but was not recommended for appointment. Fifield\u2019s press release at the time said that while Guthrie had not been recommended, she \u201cwas identified by the government as having the requisite skills\u201d. However, until now, we have not known who was passed over in Guthrie\u2019s favour. They were: \u2022 Robyn Archer \u2013 singer, writer, director and public advocate for the arts, as well as the former artistic director of the Adelaide and Melbourne international arts festivals. \u2022 Shaun Brown \u2013 former managing director of SBS for four years from 2006.

Georgie Somerset was also on the list recommended by the board, and was appointed with Guthrie. She is a Queensland cattle farmer with board experience across the not-for-profit sector. An eighth recommended person\u2019s name has not been released at their request. The list of candidates was originally ranked in order of recommendation, but as one of the conditions of release that ranking was removed, meaning it is not possible to tell who was most preferred by the nominations panel. The February 2017 appointments were one of several occasions \u2013 with the most recent being the appointment of the current ABC chairwoman, Ita Buttrose \u2013 when the recommendations of the independent nomination panel were set aside in favour of the government making its own pick. The ABC board has ultimate responsibility for the independence and integrity of the public broadcaster.

The Department of Communications and the Arts refused to release the names, initially claiming they were exempt cabinet documents and that their release would be an unreasonable breach of personal privacy \u2013 although all but one of the people on the list said they had no objection to their names being made public. The department also claimed that the names would reveal deliberative processes and that this was against the public interest. The cabinet documents claim was dropped at the first stage of appeal. After intervention by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, a single name was released earlier this year \u2013 that of Georgie Somerset, whose name was already public, given that she had been appointed. Finally, earlier this month, the acting Australian information commissioner, Elizabeth Hampton, overturned the department\u2019s decision and ordered the release of the names. Hampton took into account public controversy over the appointments process for the ABC board, particularly following allegations of political interference. She said in her decision that the release would \u201cfurther increase transparency and scrutiny of the minister\u2019s decision\u201d. While the battle over the request took place, government interference in ABC board appointments became a white hot issue following the September 2018 sacking of managing director Michelle Guthrie amid allegations the board had failed to protect her from political interference by chairman Justin Milne. Milne resigned a few days later, and in February this year was replaced by Buttrose as a direct pick of the prime minster, Scott Morrison. While her appointment was widely welcomed, she had not applied through the arm\u2019s length process, meaning another set of candidates was set aside in her favour. Some of them are known to be extremely dissatisfied at their treatment. In April, a Senate inquiry resulting from the crisis over Michelle Guthrie\u2019s sacking recommended that the appointments process should be transparent and directors have media experience, and that the minister should consult the opposition before choosing board members. Contacted for comment last night, Shaun Brown said he had applied in 2017 after being urged to do so by the recruitment agency. He was told the ABC had particularly requested they hunt for people with broadcasting experience. \u201cI gave it some thought, I read the criteria, I thought I was well positioned.\u201d He went through an \u201cextensive and elaborate\u201d process of interviews, only to find Vanessa Guthrie had been appointed despite not being recommended. \u201cI\u2019m not annoyed,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI was a bit surprised that that would be done.\u201d Brown said he would consider nominating again only if he could be sure the successful candidate had been recommended by the nominations panel. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to go through the political process of being tested for my political connections.\u201d Levy said the release showed the government had had \u201ca very good list of names \u2026 I don\u2019t know Vanessa Guthrie, and she may be terrific too, but I\u2019m a great believer if you have a process you should follow the process. All of us who put our names forward followed the process. I think it\u2019s a shame the minister went a different way.\u201d Green said: \u201cI was pretty keen, and felt I had a lot to contribute, but the minister is the minister and he has the final call.\u201d The other people on the list either did not return calls asking for comment, or could not be contacted. Attempts to contact Vanessa Guthrie were unsuccessful. Normally, the next selection process for an ABC board member would be underway now, with the term of television executive Peter Lewis expiring in October. It has been reported that Buttrose is lobbying for his term to be extended. Aside from the staff-elected director Jane Connors, managing director David Anderson and Buttrose herself, Lewis is the only member of the board with considerable media experience.",

The move underscored the uncertainty over his confirmation prospects. Democrats openly dismissed the Republican congressman from Texas as an unqualified partisan, and Republicans offered only lukewarm and tentative expressions of support. The announcement leaves the intelligence community without a permanent, Senate-confirmed leader at a time when the US government is grappling with North Korea\u2019s nuclear ambitions, the prospect of war with Iran, and the anticipated efforts of Russia or other foreign governments to interfere in the American political system. Ratcliffe is a frequent Trump defender who fiercely questioned the former special counsel Robert Mueller during his testimony before the House Judiciary Committee hearing last week. Even as Mueller laid bare concerns that Russia was working to interfere with US elections again, Ratcliffe remained focused on the possibility that US intelligence agencies had overly relied on unverified opposition research in investigating the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia. His performance clearly made a splash with Donald Trump, who subsequently nominated him to become the next director of national intelligence, replacing Dan Coats, who repeatedly clashed with Trump and revealed last weekend that he was leaving the post.

The warning signs are obvious, not least burgeoning high-consuming populations, massive biodiversity loss and multiple resource scarcities. Yet rather than reform an unsustainable system, political leaders scramble to prop it up and compound the problem. The result is Brexit, Trump\u2019s Mexican wall, escalating Middle East tension, the US-China trade standoff, a global arms and space race, Amazon deforestation and much more.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/commentisfree/2019/jun/03/we-must-mobilise-for-the-climate-emergency-like-we-do-in-war-time-where-is-the-climate-minister\">We must mobilise for the climate emergency like we do in wartime. Where is the climate minister? | Ian Dunlop and David Spratt</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In their quest for power, leaders \u2013 both democratic and authoritarian \u2013 ignore the one issue that is inexorably changing that system, namely human-induced climate change. This is an <a href=\"https://www.breakthroughonline.org.au/publications\">existential threat</a> to human civilisation that will render current political priorities irrelevant as climatic consequences move beyond human influence.</p> <p>Countering this threat requires unprecedented global co-operation to initiate <a href=\"https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2019-06-30/secretary-generals-remarks-climate-summit-preparatory-meeting\">emergency action</a>. Yet leaders opt for conflict, while suppressing information on the implications of their climate inaction.</p> <p>In May, we published a short <a href=\"https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/148cb0_90dc2a2637f348edae45943a88da04d4.pdf\">paper</a> that included a simple 3C global warming scenario for 2050, outlining the hard-nosed practical impact of climate change, as opposed to more theoretical scientific and business risk disclosure situations. This information was not new, but prompted extensive global discussion: some considered the situation entirely credible, others felt it too extreme. What became clear was the thirst for practical information of this kind.</p> <p>In response, we recently published a follow-up analysis: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.breakthroughonline.org.au/papers\">The Third Degree</a>: Evidence and implications for Australia of climate-related security risk\u201d, detailing the basis for our assumptions on issues such as chronic water shortages, coastal inundation, mass migration and extreme heat \u2013 plus an in-depth global 3C scenario originally published by US national security experts in 2007.</p> <p>We also propose a major scenario-planning initiative for Australia. Scenario-planning does not forecast, predict or express preferences for the future; rather it is storytelling, painting pictures of alternative worlds that might emerge, to assist policymakers in imagining and thinking about future possibilities. Strategy is then assessed against each possible future.</p> <p>One of the initial tasks is to identify the \u201cofficial future\u201d \u2013 the future as it is supposed to be, upon which prevailing strategy is based. A large amount of political capital is tied up in that view, typically the result of group-think generated by ideology or by business models that have stood the test of time but may be inappropriate in the future.</p> <p>Scenario-planning explores the future, allowing constructive discussion on alternatives incorporating the full range of credible evidence. In particular, there must be a preparedness to think beyond conventional wisdom, after which a reassessment of the official future is often inevitable, and proactively undertaken.</p> <p>Nowhere is this more necessary than in Australia, the continent most exposed to climate change, where the official future for the last two decades has been, and remains, climate denial and delay.</p> <p>Political expediency, blinkered ideology and short-term business thinking rejects or deflects climate science and expert advice. <a href=\"https://johnmenadue.com/ian-dunlop-climate-policy-predatory-delay-destroys-prosperity-threatens-survival/\">Predatory delay</a> is used to prolong the life of our high-carbon economy for short-term financial gain, irrespective of the damage to society. Policy, such as it is, views climate change as a non-problem.</p> <p>The blatant inconsistency of Australia\u2019s position beggars belief. We are signatories to the UNFCCC, supposedly committed to avoiding dangerous climate change, which is already happening. Australia ratified the Paris agreement to restrict temperature increase below 2C and ideally towards 1.5C, yet our emissions are rising rapidly even though there is no carbon budget remaining to stay below even 2C. Incredibly, we ramp up new fossil fuel projects: Adani coal, gas expansion, fracking in NT and WA, and more. Then we have the gall to carry over unused carbon credits from the Kyoto protocol to obscure the failure of our wholly inadequate Paris emission reduction commitments; credits which were <a href=\"https://johnmenadue.com/ian-dunlop-climate-policy-predatory-delay-destroys-prosperity-threatens-survival/\"> unjustified</a> in the first place.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/08/fossil-fuel-exports-make-australia-one-of-the-worst-contributors-to-climate-crisis\">Fossil fuel exports make Australia one of the worst contributors to climate crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We are already the fifth largest carbon polluter globally when exports are included \u2013 about <a href=\"https://climateanalytics.org/media/australia_carbon_footprint_report_july2019.pdf\">5% of global emissions</a>.

      "bodyText": "The top priority of government is security of the people. Yet on the greatest threat of all, most governments are failing abysmally. As the global influence of western democracies wanes with the ascendancy of China, India and other emerging countries, the resulting power struggle is diverting attention from the great issues the world faces, to their symptoms. The neoliberal market economy, with its unregulated consumption and rapacious short-term outlook, is destroying modern civilisation. The warning signs are obvious, not least burgeoning high-consuming populations, massive biodiversity loss and multiple resource scarcities. Yet rather than reform an unsustainable system, political leaders scramble to prop it up and compound the problem. The result is Brexit, Trump\u2019s Mexican wall, escalating Middle East tension, the US-China trade standoff, a global arms and space race, Amazon deforestation and much more. In their quest for power, leaders \u2013 both democratic and authoritarian \u2013 ignore the one issue that is inexorably changing that system, namely human-induced climate change. This is an existential threat to human civilisation that will render current political priorities irrelevant as climatic consequences move beyond human influence. Countering this threat requires unprecedented global co-operation to initiate emergency action. Yet leaders opt for conflict, while suppressing information on the implications of their climate inaction. In May, we published a short paper that included a simple 3C global warming scenario for 2050, outlining the hard-nosed practical impact of climate change, as opposed to more theoretical scientific and business risk disclosure situations. This information was not new, but prompted extensive global discussion: some considered the situation entirely credible, others felt it too extreme. What became clear was the thirst for practical information of this kind. In response, we recently published a follow-up analysis: \u201cThe Third Degree: Evidence and implications for Australia of climate-related security risk\u201d, detailing the basis for our assumptions on issues such as chronic water shortages, coastal inundation, mass migration and extreme heat \u2013 plus an in-depth global 3C scenario originally published by US national security experts in 2007. We also propose a major scenario-planning initiative for Australia. Scenario-planning does not forecast, predict or express preferences for the future; rather it is storytelling, painting pictures of alternative worlds that might emerge, to assist policymakers in imagining and thinking about future possibilities. Strategy is then assessed against each possible future. One of the initial tasks is to identify the \u201cofficial future\u201d \u2013 the future as it is supposed to be, upon which prevailing strategy is based. A large amount of political capital is tied up in that view, typically the result of group-think generated by ideology or by business models that have stood the test of time but may be inappropriate in the future. Scenario-planning explores the future, allowing constructive discussion on alternatives incorporating the full range of credible evidence. In particular, there must be a preparedness to think beyond conventional wisdom, after which a reassessment of the official future is often inevitable, and proactively undertaken. Nowhere is this more necessary than in Australia, the continent most exposed to climate change, where the official future for the last two decades has been, and remains, climate denial and delay. Political expediency, blinkered ideology and short-term business thinking rejects or deflects climate science and expert advice. Predatory delay is used to prolong the life of our high-carbon economy for short-term financial gain, irrespective of the damage to society. Policy, such as it is, views climate change as a non-problem. The blatant inconsistency of Australia\u2019s position beggars belief. We are signatories to the UNFCCC, supposedly committed to avoiding dangerous climate change, which is already happening. Australia ratified the Paris agreement to restrict temperature increase below 2C and ideally towards 1.5C, yet our emissions are rising rapidly even though there is no carbon budget remaining to stay below even 2C. Incredibly, we ramp up new fossil fuel projects: Adani coal, gas expansion, fracking in NT and WA, and more. Then we have the gall to carry over unused carbon credits from the Kyoto protocol to obscure the failure of our wholly inadequate Paris emission reduction commitments; credits which were unjustified in the first place. We are already the fifth largest carbon polluter globally when exports are included \u2013 about 5% of global emissions. On current projections, by 2030 Australia will be responsible for a massive 13% of global emissions. Our fossil fuel industries are subsidised annually by about US$29bn or 2.3% of GDP, far in excess of anything given to the low carbon industries. And this in a country with probably the greatest low-carbon energy potential in the world \u2013 potential we are wasting, blocked by deliberately obstructive federal policy. Australia\u2019s climate stance is totally untenable in geopolitical terms, nothing less than a crime against humanity, as Pacific countries continually point out. The federal government does its utmost to hide these facts from public view. Accordingly, Australia must undertake serious scenario-planning to inform the public of the criminal damage being inflicted upon them by their government, and to develop contingencies for emergency action as the official future of accelerating high-carbon growth inevitably falls apart in the near future. The government\u2019s role should be to protect the future from the past, not the past from the future. When government refuses to lead, others must. \u2022 Ian Dunlop was formerly an international oil, gas and coal industry executive, chair of the Australian Coal Association and CEO of the Australian Institute of Company Directors.

      "bodyText": "It is an action of last resort when handling an extreme corporate public relations crisis: if your world is exploding around your ears take out a full-page advertisement in the daily newspapers to protest your innocence. Crown Resorts, the powerful and highly recognisable proprietor of the largest casino complex in the southern hemisphere and product of Australia\u2019s second-most powerful business dynasty, the Packer family, reached for the PR nuclear button last Thursday. The advertisements were a vigorous denial of allegations made in the Australian media that Crown had, in an effort to attract Chinese high rollers to its Melbourne gaming rooms, partnered with people linked to organised crime and encouraged staff based in mainland China to stretch strict laws against promoting gambling, which led to 19 Crown staff members being arrested in China in 2016. The allegations were reported by Nine Entertainment Company, which formerly shared ownership with Crown, in its flagship newspapers and television current affairs program 60 Minutes. Crown shares dropped 7.7% in two days after the report aired. It was, said Crown, in a lengthy missive signed by its entire board, a \u201cdeceitful campaign\u201d of \u201cpoor or misleading journalism\u201d. The Crown advertisements ran in the newspapers operated by Rupert Murdoch, a longtime rival of the Packers, whose domestic media empire once rivalled his own, but were not printed in Nine\u2019s papers. Instead those papers ran a defence rebutting each of Crown\u2019s claims, one by one. For a company used to exercising its sizeable influence to silence critics, it was a novel experience. \u201cThey are big players and they\u2019re used to getting what they want,\u201d Dr Charles Livingstone, an anti-gambling advocate and longtime critic of Crown, told the Guardian. \u201cThis is new territory.\u201d \u2018Like crossing Rupert\u2019 Crown\u2019s influence in Australia began as an extension of the influence wielded by the Packers, who have been a dominating force in the cultural and business landscape for three generations. Sir Frank Packer was a media mogul who owned a stable of newspapers and magazines and launched the television network which became Nine. His son, Kerry Packer, made a name for himself internationally when he set up World Series Cricket, a commercial rival to the traditional game.

They don\u2019t really have that clout any more, and I suspect it\u2019s no coincidence that these revelations are starting to come thick and fast once that connection to power has evaporated.\u201d Two months ago Packer changed course again, selling almost half of his 46.1% stake in Crown to Melco Resorts and Entertainment, with whom Crown jointly opened the Hollywood-themed Studio City resort in Macau in 2015. (You may remember Studio City from the Martin Scorsese-directed $70m, 15-minute short film/advertisement starring De Niro, Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio.) Negative publicity, particularly around Crown\u2019s conduct in China, could cause difficulty for Packer\u2019s plans to sell more of his share to Melco. It has already been complicated by the arrests of Crown staff. Crown is facing a class action from its employees who were arrested in the night-time raids in October 2016. Allegations that Crown retained junket operators linked to Macau triads to attract high rollers could cause further issues. Junket operators are used by all casino operators to attract wealthy punters from mainland China, where both gambling and promoting gambling is illegal. Crown defended its relationship with junket operator Suncity, which has been blacklisted from the Hong Kong jockey club, but said it no longer works with any of the other junket operators listed by Nine and had a \u201crobust process for vetting junket operators\u201d. Among those alleged to have arrived on a private jet bound for Crown is a cousin of the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. After allegations about the links between junkets used by Crown and the Macau triads, the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission confirmed that it was also investigating the relationship between junkets and Australian casinos as part of a taskforce established in 2013 called Targeting Criminal Wealth. It is one of five Australian authorities that is actively investigating, or has been asked to investigate, criminal or corrupt conduct linked to Crown. One of the investigations concerns the alleged shooting of wombats, which are protected Australian wildlife, on the property of a top performing junket operator. The inquiries Two days after the new allegations were published, the independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie exercised his parliamentary privilege to outline the allegations of a former Crown driver turned whistleblower, who had contacted Wilkie through his PokieLeaks website. The driver, Wilkie told parliament, routinely transported foreign high rollers from Crown\u2019s private jet at Melbourne airport, where they were not subject to any border checks. \u201cForeign nationals were getting off with up to 15 bags for a short stay, stopping only on the way to the casino to pick up a sex worker,\u201d Wilkie said. He called for a parliamentary inquiry, which was backed by five crossbench MPs but voted down by the ruling Coalition and the opposition Labor party. Rebekha Sharkie, from the minor party Centre Alliance, accused the major parties of ignoring the allegations because Crown is a major political donor. Former government officials say the government\u2019s hesitancy could be less sinister and more difficult to resolve: an effective crackdown on Crown could result in a licence suspension or cancellation. Crown is the largest single-site private sector employer in both Victoria and Western Australia, with 18,000 direct employees. It paid $650m in federal and state taxes in 2018. Shutting it down, even temporarily, would cause economic shockwaves. Independent and minor party MPs, including the Greens, used the allegations as grist to renew calls for a federal anti-corruption body. Livingstone went further, saying: \u201cA royal commission into the gambling industry is looking increasingly like a good idea.\u201d The federal government, with the opposition\u2019s support, referred the allegations to the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity (ACLEI), an acronym not known for its teeth. \u201cIt\u2019s a snow job and the government and the opposition will be hoping that the world moves on,\u201d Wilkie told the Guardian. \u201cThis is a remarkable case of the failure of our regulatory and justice system and governance at both federal and state levels.\u201d Wilkie had already referred earlier allegations of money laundering and drug trafficking at Crown to the Victorian Independent Broad-based Anti-Corruption Commission. The Victorian gaming regulator also called a snap investigation. In a statement, a Crown spokesperson said Nine\u2019s reporting \u201chas been based on unsubstantiated allegations, exaggerations, unsupported connections and outright falsehoods\u201d. Nine rejects the statement and Crown has not provided evidence to support it. Crown said it \u201cwelcomes the opportunity to provide any information to law enforcement and regulatory agencies\u201d. Even if Crown survives five concurrent inquiries without a scratch, Livingstone said, the company could still be in trouble. \u201cIf the allegations are not properly responded to, the stink is not going to go away,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "One night in early June 2018, the Australian far-right provocateur, convicted criminal and Facebook Live auteur Neil Erikson showed up at the Queensland home of a little-known conservative broadcaster and tour promoter named David Pellowe. Set to the music from the opening credits of Quentin Tarantino\u2019s 1992 film Reservoir Dogs, a video taken that night and later deleted from social media shows Erikson and three members of his \u201cCook\u2019s Convicts\u201d crew en route to Pellowe\u2019s home on the Gold Coast. \u201cDavid Pellowe went around calling Cook\u2019s Convicts neo-Nazis to stop Milo Yiannopoulos coming to Australia to tour this country for you,\u201d Eriksen says to the camera. \u201cThis guy\u2019s a cuck-servative.\u201d Inside, Pellowe can be heard threatening to call the police if the men do not leave his property. They hover on his doorstep for less then a minute before the music starts again and they leave. It\u2019s the kind of ill-conceived, poorly executed stunt Erikson has made his name from, but it also demonstrated the competition for a slice of an emerging market for rightwing speaking tours. At the time, Erikson was aligned with another obscure rightwing figure from Queensland named Dan Spiller. Spiller was eager to team up with Yiannopoulos, the far-right agitator and former Breitbart writer, who was hot property in Australia after an earlier speaking tour with Penthouse publisher Damien Costas. Pellowe, a rival promoter who brought out controversial YouTuber Lauren Southern in 2018, says he had nothing to do with any falling out. Spiller did not return calls and texts on Friday, and Guardian Australia does not suggest he had anything to do with Eriksen\u2019s arrival on Pellowe\u2019s doorstep last year. But the stunt hints at a broader phenomenon taking place on the extremes of Australia\u2019s right. From Yiannopoulos to Nigel Farage, Tommy Robinson, Gavin McInnes and Southern, there is no shortage of hard right and far-right tourists keen to cash in on an apparent demand for their services in Australia, or promoters wanting a piece of the action. When the powerful Conservative Political Action Conference arrives in Sydney next week, it will not only be joining a much larger play for a slice of a thriving market but representing the biggest and most mainstream effort so far. \u201cFor a long time, a lot of rightwing figures have seen a potential market in Australia,\u201d David Smith from the US Studies Centre told Guardian Australia this week. \u201cOften they come when they\u2019re becoming increasingly desperate. Someone like Milo started touring here when his career was collapsing in the US. \u201cBut really, the kind of threatened conservatism they\u2019re selling is transnational and it already has a place in Australia. You know, Sky News after dark, the syndicated Murdoch columnists. Australia really is a natural direction for CPAC to go in.\u201d While Spiller\u2019s foray into tour promotion fell over after he dramatically fell out with Yiannopoulos over a later tour, there is no shortage of players looking to capitalise. Besides, Pellowe\u2019s promotion of Southern last year, Costas has played host to both Yiannopoulos and Farage. \u201cThis whole rightwing speaking tour thing, we basically invented it when we brought Milo out and then we did Farage after that,\u201d Costas told Guardian Australia. \u201cIt was basically a PR stunt. Milo was an internet sensation at the time and he was an advocate for free speech and that aligned with the Penthouse brand. We didn\u2019t expect it to be as big as it was, that was a complete fluke. We didn\u2019t realise I think just how disenfranchised people in Australia felt, particularly young men.\u201d Costas, who does not consider himself rightwing but as a supporter of free speech, ended up in court with his partner on the Yiannopoulos tour, the celebrity agent Max Markson. But he remains bullish that there\u2019s money to be made from the far-right speaking circuit. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t continue to seek opportunities in this space, and I wouldn\u2019t have Penthouse continue to seek out opportunities in this space if it wasn\u2019t profitable both in a monetary and a marketing sense,\u201d he says. And the arrival of CPAC suggests conservative organisations around the globe agree. This week the conference\u2019s Australian organiser, Andrew Cooper, told Guardian Australia the event\u2019s US backers, the American Conservative Union, were committed to making the event a \u201cmulti-year, forever-type project\u201d aimed at galvanising the right wing of Australian politics. The conference will feature Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage, the former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott, Fox News host Jeanine Pirro and New South Wales One Nation politician Mark Latham. Founded by the American Conservative Union, the CPAC conference has been running in the US since 1974, when Ronald Reagan gave the inaugural keynote speech. The conference attracts tens of thousands of people each year and, Smith explains, is a \u201cmajor ideological institution\u201d which acts as a \u201cgatekeeper\u201d for the Republican party. \u201cIn terms of their structure and organisation, American political parties are actually very weak,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re not like parties here where there\u2019s a strong central structure that comes up with policy and enforces discipline. So something like CPAC plays a very important in setting the ideological tone. Because it\u2019s quite a prestigious conference, its choices of speakers are quite an important indicator of who is rising and falling within conservative circles.\u201d Where once it was a standard-bearer for the kind of staid conservatism of the Reagan and Bush eras, Smith says the conference has undergone a major ideological shift that began with the election of Barack Obama. \u201cAfter Bush, the Republicans went form being a dominant, unstoppable force to an embattled party,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was a real fear that an entire cultural shift had taken place and left them behind, and the response was the radicalism that started with the Tea Party. And we have seen at CPAC in last few years is that it has shifted from what was once the mainstream right to the fringe right. \u201cIt\u2019s really dragging the mainstream of conservatism to the fringes. There are figures now at CPAC who would have been considered beyond the pale of respectability a few years ago.\u201d In 2017, for example, a triumphant Steve Bannon appeared on stage at the conference. \u201cI want to thank you for finally inviting me to CPAC,\u201d he reportedly said to ACU chairman Matt Schlapp. The Australian conference, Smith says, reflects that shift. Despite conservative leaders in Kirribilli, Downing Street and the White House, Cooper told Guardian Australia this week that he did not feel triumphant. \u201cI think all over the place there is a concern that free speech is under threat from what I call the authoritarian left,\u201d he said. The conference\u2019s target market, he said, was \u201cthe 51% of Australians who despair at the thought of a Labor government\u201d. This week the Labor senator Kristina Keneally described the conference as a \u201ctalkfest of hate\u201d, and called on the government to block the visa of one of the speakers, Raheem Kassam, a former chief adviser to Farage and editor-in-chief of Breitbart. Speaking in parliament, Keneally pointed to comments the former UK Independence party leadership candidate has previously made on Islam and women.

In the ambulance, a paramedic tells the officers Timpa is not breathing. Another paramedic points at Timpa and says: \u201cHe\u2019s dead.\u201d The film forms part of a lawsuit filed by Timpa\u2019s family that claims police used excessive force. \u201cThe footage graphically depicts the needless death of an unarmed young man,\u201d the family\u2019s lawyer, Geoff Henley, told the New York Times on Thursday. \u201cWhat is worse, some of the officers seemed more interested in sophomoric gallows humor than ensuring that they were keeping Tony alive.\u201d For three years following a Dallas Morning News investigation, city and state authorities resisted its release. Initially, they argued first that the video\u2019s publication would interfere with an open criminal case that charged the officers with \u201cengaging in reckless conduct that placed Timpa in imminent danger of serious bodily injury\u201d. Later, officials cited the case\u2019s dismissal. In March, the charges were dismissed because Dallas county district attorney John Creuzot, after consulting three medical examiners, concluded it was unlikely prosecutors could secure a conviction. The officers were disciplined, and returned to active duty a month later. Timpa\u2019s death was classified by an autopsy as a homicide, his death caused by sudden cardiac death due to \u201cthe toxic effects of cocaine and the stress associated with physical restraint\u201d.",

Essentially, Klopp feels his Reds are a year behind the Blues.</p> <p>As Klopp prepared for Sunday\u2019s Community Shield match with City, there was a hint of incredulity about his response when asked about City\u2019s favourites\u2019 status for the title.</p> <p>\u201cBecause they\u2019ve won the league twice in a row?\u201d he replied by way of an isn\u2019t-that-obvious explanation. \u201cThat\u2019s one reason. Ours was the first year on that level; we have to prove again that we can be on that level. Ninety-seven points was not a coincidence but it\u2019s not as if we outplayed all the teams, that we shot them out of the stadium constantly. We had tight games. We were a real results machine last year, really impressive.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/02/premier-league-201920-preview-no-10-liverpool\">Premier League 2019\u201120 preview No 10: Liverpool</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The same description could be applied to City, who seized the title with 14 straight victories from February to May and, as Klopp said, City have not got weaker.</p> <p>\u201cThe champions didn\u2019t lose a player, apart from [Vincent] Kompany, but they will be able to do something there. They are pretty consistent, a good age group, experienced.\u201d</p> <p>Klopp omitted the sales of Fabian Delph and Douglas Luiz, but City have signed Rodri and Angelino. Liverpool, as some of the more anxious fans note, have not made a perceived major signing.</p> <p>This, however, is not the negative to Klopp that it is to some. He has retained his core squad and is relaxed, perhaps, because his Bundesliga-winning Borussia Dortmund teams were raided for players such as Mario G\u00f6tze, Nuri Sahin and Robert Lewandowski before fully maturing together. \u201cFor the first time in my career, from next Monday I will have the team back together again, that\u2019s true,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThese are the transfers we did,\u201d referring to new contracts secured over the past year for Sadio Man\u00e9, Mo Salah and others.

Klopp acknowledged this: \u201cThe higher you get, the more difficult it is. But we have a lot of space for improvement. First, we have to try to reach last season\u2019s level again.</p> <p>\u201cWhen, if that happens, then you can make the next steps but it\u2019s not always \u2026 it\u2019s not PlayStation where you can go to the next skill or whatever.\u201d</p> <p>What he has stressed as much as anything is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/01/tottenham-liverpool-champions-league-final-match-report\" title=\"\">the Champions League win over Tottenham</a> is not dwelt on. That, he knows, is easier said than done.</p> <p>Reflecting on continuing jubilation, Klopp said wryly: \u201cIf you\u2019re not successful, people still want pictures, but don\u2019t talk to you that long.</p> <p>\u201cIf you win something, everybody feels the need to tell you \u2013 first of all \u2018congratulations\u2019, then where they watched it, how they watched it, how they felt, how their family felt, how their friends felt, how the dog felt.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all nice but it keeps you in that moment.

He has been vocal about player burnout and cannot understand why the Premier League begins next weekend. \u201cSomebody has to start this discussion,\u201d he said. \u201cI spoke to [Napoli\u2019s] Carlo Ancelotti \u2013 Italy has 20 teams as well and their season starts on August 24th.</p> <p>\u201c[Kalidou] Koulibaly, who played with Sadio [Man\u00e9] at the African Cup of Nations has four weeks\u2019 holiday. He\u2019s not even close to coming back.\u201d</p> <p>Man\u00e9, Klopp noted, will have had 16 days off this summer. Fifpro, the international players\u2019 union, released a report this week on the subject: \u2018At the Limit.\u2019 Man\u00e9, they said, played 70 games for club and country over the past 12 months. Spurs\u2019 Son Heung-min played 78.</p> <p>There will be a winter break in the Premier League this season, although the league described it as \u201ca mid-season player break\u201d when it was announced, as games will continue in a staggered form over two weekends in February.</p> <p>It feels a long way away to Klopp. \u201cThe Premier League is such a wonderful product.

As Klopp prepared for Sunday\u2019s Community Shield match with City, there was a hint of incredulity about his response when asked about City\u2019s favourites\u2019 status for the title. \u201cBecause they\u2019ve won the league twice in a row?\u201d he replied by way of an isn\u2019t-that-obvious explanation. \u201cThat\u2019s one reason. Ours was the first year on that level; we have to prove again that we can be on that level. Ninety-seven points was not a coincidence but it\u2019s not as if we outplayed all the teams, that we shot them out of the stadium constantly. We had tight games. We were a real results machine last year, really impressive.\u201d The same description could be applied to City, who seized the title with 14 straight victories from February to May and, as Klopp said, City have not got weaker. \u201cThe champions didn\u2019t lose a player, apart from [Vincent] Kompany, but they will be able to do something there. They are pretty consistent, a good age group, experienced.\u201d Klopp omitted the sales of Fabian Delph and Douglas Luiz, but City have signed Rodri and Angelino. Liverpool, as some of the more anxious fans note, have not made a perceived major signing. This, however, is not the negative to Klopp that it is to some. He has retained his core squad and is relaxed, perhaps, because his Bundesliga-winning Borussia Dortmund teams were raided for players such as Mario G\u00f6tze, Nuri Sahin and Robert Lewandowski before fully maturing together. \u201cFor the first time in my career, from next Monday I will have the team back together again, that\u2019s true,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are the transfers we did,\u201d referring to new contracts secured over the past year for Sadio Man\u00e9, Mo Salah and others. It is 18 months since Virgil van Dijk joined, 12 since Alisson arrived, plus Naby Ke\u00efta, Fabinho and Xherdan Shaqiri. \u201cKeeping the boys together, staying aggressive, greedy: let\u2019s get going again,\u201d he said. It is evolution after a revolution, although losing once in reaching 97 points suggests scope for improvement is limited compared with, for example, Liverpool\u2019s previous summer. Klopp acknowledged this: \u201cThe higher you get, the more difficult it is. But we have a lot of space for improvement. First, we have to try to reach last season\u2019s level again. \u201cWhen, if that happens, then you can make the next steps but it\u2019s not always \u2026 it\u2019s not PlayStation where you can go to the next skill or whatever.\u201d What he has stressed as much as anything is the Champions League win over Tottenham is not dwelt on. That, he knows, is easier said than done. Reflecting on continuing jubilation, Klopp said wryly: \u201cIf you\u2019re not successful, people still want pictures, but don\u2019t talk to you that long. \u201cIf you win something, everybody feels the need to tell you \u2013 first of all \u2018congratulations\u2019, then where they watched it, how they watched it, how they felt, how their family felt, how their friends felt, how the dog felt. \u201cIt\u2019s all nice but it keeps you in that moment. I want to be completely focused on a new season.\u201d Liverpool\u2019s planning goes beyond it: they have begun preparations for next year\u2019s pre-season and Klopp said he was resigned to not having around 15 players because of the European Championship and Copa Am\u00e9rica. He has been vocal about player burnout and cannot understand why the Premier League begins next weekend. \u201cSomebody has to start this discussion,\u201d he said. \u201cI spoke to [Napoli\u2019s] Carlo Ancelotti \u2013 Italy has 20 teams as well and their season starts on August 24th. \u201c[Kalidou] Koulibaly, who played with Sadio [Man\u00e9] at the African Cup of Nations has four weeks\u2019 holiday. He\u2019s not even close to coming back.\u201d Man\u00e9, Klopp noted, will have had 16 days off this summer. Fifpro, the international players\u2019 union, released a report this week on the subject: \u2018At the Limit.\u2019 Man\u00e9, they said, played 70 games for club and country over the past 12 months. Spurs\u2019 Son Heung-min played 78. There will be a winter break in the Premier League this season, although the league described it as \u201ca mid-season player break\u201d when it was announced, as games will continue in a staggered form over two weekends in February. It feels a long way away to Klopp. \u201cThe Premier League is such a wonderful product. We don\u2019t need these two weeks now where nobody in the whole world is playing, only the Premier League. It doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Paul Doyle was at the game! Here is his report: Luton reaction ... Bradley: \u201cI would much rather win 1-0. It\u2019s a good goal. We showed great character tonight.\u201d Collins: \u201cI am really disappointed I didn\u2019t score the second one. Randolph is a guy I know really well and a top class goalkeeper and he did really well.\u201d James Collins seems like a nice fella. Savage stuff. Hopefully every game will be like that this season. What a game! I am not sure the quality was particularly impressive but there was so much action I do not know where to start. From missed penalties to goalkeeping cock ups. It was probably a fair result in the end. 90+2 mins: WHAT A SAVE! Luton work the ball into the box as Moncur finds Collins six yards from goal, allowing the striker swizzle and whack what looks like a winner but Randolph reacts superbly to stop the shot. Cornick smashes the rebound straight at Coulson. 90 mins: Fletcher battles past Pearson and drives a shot at goal but it\u2019s straight at Sluga. Four minutes added on. 89 mins: Mpanzu lifts a cross which goes inches over Collins\u2019 head and is put out for a throw. 87 mins: Bradley heads clear a free-kick and Mpanzu does the rest. PUMP THIS INCOMPETENCE INTO MY VEINS! The ball is lumped towards the Boro box, Wing heads it into the wrong direction then Shotton loses a header, before Potts\u2019 shot is blocked, allowing Collins to pounce onto the rebound and calmly slot into a gaping net. 84 mins: Assombalonga tries to make up for his terrible penalty by bounding his way through the Luton defence but Sluga comes out very quickly to dispossess the striker. Coulson is taken out by Cranie just outside the area but the referee still points to the spot. Assombalonga waddles up and whacks the ball a few yards over the bar. That was rubbish. 80 mins: Wing sends a corner right onto Ayala\u2019s head six yards out but his bullet header is impressively repelled by Sluga and Luton somehow clear the ball. The goalkeeper does well again, coming out quickly to tackle Assombalonga. 78 mins: Things are getting a bit scrappy out there at the moment as Luton look to force the issue and Boro try to hold onto their slender lead. 76 mins: Sub Cornick looks lively on the right but his cross is deflected into Randolph\u2019s hands before Collins can get to it. 74 mins: Wing goes for another goal but drags his shot well wide from the edge of the area. Joe Pearson emails in: \u201cAs my first experience with the Championship on tv (just subscribed to ESPN+), this is fun! The defenders have been almost universally comical. There are more goals in this for sure.\u201d It\u2019s all about the comedy. 72 mins: On the downside, the song for Lewis Wing sounds rubbish: \u201cLewis ... Lewis Wing!\u201d. That is pathetic. 70 mins: The pyros are still going off in the away end! WHAT A STRIKE! Wing gets the ball 25 yards from goal, gets it out of his feet and whips it into the top corner, giving Sluga no chance. It was an incredible bit of precision. 67 mins: It might be time for Boro to make a change. I would advise bringing on Gestede for Assombalonga who is bringing very little to the party. 65 mins: The change in system from Luton to a diamond since the introduction of Butterfield is giving Boro more space to roam into out wide. Will it cost the hosts? 63 mins: Coulson whips in a couple of crosses from the left in quick succession; the first is punch clear by Sluga and the second flashes across the six-yard area but no one can get on the end of it. 61 mins: Butterfield replaces Lee to make his Luton debut as Jones rolls the dice first. Wing finally goes into the book after his umpteenth foul, this time taking down Shinnie about four seconds too late. 59 mins: Luton are very much the better side in the half, which is helping the fans find their voice. 57 mins: McManaman looks to find Collins with a cross to the back post but Howson gets in between the man and the ball, allowing him to head it clear. Luton should really have a penalty after Potts turns in the area and is taken down by Wing but the Middlesbrough gets away with it. 55 mins: Luton are popping the ball about a little, earning a few ole\u2019s from the crowd. Sadly, it doesn\u2019t result in anything useful. 53 mins: McNair gets the ball inside the box and whacks a cross/shot which flicks off Mpanzu and glances the bar with Sluga looking helpless on his line. 51 mins: Not much happening, I will be honest. 49 mins: NO GOAL! McManaman whips in a cross from the right which Collins diverts home from six yards with his hand. The referee rules it out after Randolph\u2019s protestations and books the striker for his deceit. 47 mins: Shotton nails a 20-yard pass. I am off for a lie down. A sweeping move from Luton is ended inside the area when Wing dives in to divert the ball out of a corner. Here we go again! That\u2019s a bad mistake ... I am going to put it out there after 45 minutes of the season: neither of these teams are going up. This is a democratic group ... A fun start to the season with a mixture of great quality and utterly ludicrous calamity. Long may it continue. 45 mins: Mpanzu goes into the book for pulling back McNair when Middlesbrough were about to break away. Two minutes to be added on. 44 mins: Woodgate is chewing a lot of gum. Is he the new Fergie? 42 mins: Luton are looking very nervous at the back. They are trying to pass it around and they really don\u2019t have the time or the quality to do it. Sluga seems anxious following his error, too. 40 mins: Collins digs out a cross from the left to the back post where McManaman volleys wide from six yards. The Luton winger should really be doing better from there. A couple of utterly dreadful mistakes from Luton as Shinnie gives the ball away on the edge of the area, allowing Fletcher to play in Assombalonga who hits a tame shot from 10 yards which inexplicably goes through Sluga\u2019s hands despite only travelling at roughly two miles an hour. What a howler from the \u2018keeper. 36 mins: Assombalonga has only had four touches so far, which is a sign of how badly things are going in the final third for Boro. Some patient buildup from the visitors results in Johnson getting the ball on the right, cutting in onto his favoured left foot and curling a shot from 25 yards destined for the top corner until Sluga moves to his right and palms it over the top. 34 mins: Mpanzu is once again cut down, this time by Johnson. Luton do not work the free-kick particularly well as Shinnie passes it sideways to Tunnicliffe who is quickly closed down and can only get a pathetic shot off which is blocked before it gets anywhere near the net. 32 mins: Wing finds space on the right, sends in a dangerous cross into the area where Assombalonga and Pearson battle for the ball, which bounces off the striker before Sluga claws it off the line. Luckily, for the hosts, the whistle had already blown. 30 mins: Woodgate really needs to explain to Shotton that he cannot pass the ball more than five yards. For a second time he completely misses his target, whacking the ball well out of play when plenty was on. 28 mins: Mpanzu is growing into this game after some early struggles. He gets the ball when under pressure, slipping away from a couple of Boro players before McNair crudely takes him down. 26 mins: How\u2019s Adam Clayton? He\u2019s not fine after Potts jumps over his leg to win a free-kick. Shinnie whips it in a shot from the left but it goes well over. McManaman whips cross into the corridor of uncertainty, helmed by Ayala who mis-kicks his clearance out for a corner. The resulting set piece is swung to the back post, where Cranie jumps unchallenged and heads home from six yards. 21 mins: A long ball down the middle is headed into McNair\u2019s path, he gets it out of his feet and hits a low shot from 25 yards, which is deflected just wide of the goal. The corner is flicked away by a Luton head for another set-piece from the other side. 19 mins: Johnson is looking lively on the right wing. He is not lacking confidence and tries to make the most of it by shifting the ball onto this left foot and driving a low shot from inside the area but Sluga is equal to it. CRASH! BANG! WALLOP! WHAT A GOAL! Boro clear a corner to the edge of the box, it ends up at Bradley\u2019s feet, allowing the Luton to whack the ball into the top corner from 20 yards with his left foot for his first goal for the club. 14 mins: Shinnie curls a free-kick into the box from the right flank but it only finds a Boro head in the box. 12 mins: Shinnie whips in a corner from the right, which finds a Luton head and bounces down, allowing Bradley to fire a shot off, hitting a Boro player in the process. There are claims for handball but the referee isn\u2019t interested. Luton perform an intricate free-kick, resulting in Potts smashing a cross into the box but Ayala is in the right place to send it behind. The corner comes to nothing. 10 mins: Lots of chants already for Woodgate from the away end. Mpanzu is really struggling on the ball in front of the defence, as Middlesbrough close him down whenever he gets the ball. Luton might need a chance of plan here. Luton fail to fully clear a corner, allowing Johnson a second chance to whip in a cross from the right, allowing Fletcher to work a little bit of space and flick it home from six yards out. 6 mins: Middlesbrough are playing pretty direct here, looking to get the ball up to Fletcher and Assombalonga. Not much has come from it, mind. 4 mins: Luton\u2019s full-backs are quite happy to bomb on and they\u2019re content to leave just the two centre-backs protecting things in defence. Coulson could be in for a tiring night up against Cranie and McManaman. At the other end, Fletcher cuts in from the left and fires a shot from the edge of the area, dragging it just wide. 2 mins: Coulson lifts on down the line, Assombalonga battles for it but he is edged out and the ball os cleared for a corner. The set-piece is pretty pathetic and is whacked away at the front post. Peep! Peep! Peep! Let\u2019s get ready to rumble! A decent atmosphere in the ground, as the crowd rise to cheer the arrival of the players on the pitch. Kenilworth Road is packed! Day one: Commentators on scaffolding! What a treat! Coulson at left-back is making his Boro debut tonight. He will be an interesting player to watch. He\u2019s represented England at youth level and has enjoyed a couple of loan spells. It is part of Woodgate\u2019s plan to give youth a chance, so will want to prove his new manager right. Can Fulham bounce back this season? Jonny Howson is now a right-back? No one told me. This is something I am going to struggle to take in. When they start taking goal-kicks to players inside the area I am going to get really confused. The big test for the evening is trying to remember the fundamentals of football after the break. What is a corner? Can you score with your hands? Is drinking in the stands permitted? I, for one, cannot wait to find out. Would you like any of these in your team? Calum McManaman lines up for Luton tonight after a few underwhelming years. He knows Graeme Jones from Wigan and will be looking to show what he can do for his new club with some wing wizardry. Woody\u2019s first game in charge. Will it go better than his Real Madrid debut when he scored an own goal and was sent off? Here is our Championship preview to whet your appetite ... Luton: Sluga, Cranie, Potts, Tunnicliffe, Bradley, Pearson, McManaman, Lee, Shinnie, Mpanzu, Collins Subs: Shea, Berry, Cornick, Moncur, Galloway, Jones, Butterfield Middlesbrough: Randolph, Howson, Ayala, Shotton, Coulson, Clayton, Wing, McNair, Johnson, Fletcher, Assombalonga Subs: Pears, Bola, Wood, Saville, Tavernier, Browne, Gestede Good evening! It\u2019s back! Soccer is back! We\u2019re all here for it! After a break of roughly a day, domestic football has returned to our green pitches. In 90 minutes time we will know whether Luton and Middlesbrough are set for glory or a season of struggle. Obviously, that is not true. It will be interesting to see how two new managers in their first job will settle into their role. Luton have come up two divisions in recent seasons and will be looking to show they can compete in the Championship. After Tony Pulis bored the fans to death, Woodgate will be aiming to offer some hope with something slightly more exciting than one of eight defenders lumping the ball forward. Anyway ... football is back!",

      "bodyText": "England remain tight-lipped over the fitness of Jimmy Anderson as it emerged that Mark Wood, one of their World Cup-winning fast bowlers, will miss the rest of the season because of side and knee injuries. Anderson bowled only four overs on day one of the first Ashes Test before being sent to hospital for scans. He reported \u201ctightness\u201d in the same right calf that was torn while playing for Lancashire at the end of June and which forced him to miss a month of cricket. But amid fears the possible recurrence will require him to sit out the rest of the series \u2013 potentially the last Ashes of his record-breaking career \u2013 the 37-year-old is keeping alive the slim hope he can somehow bowl again in Australia\u2019s second innings. Anderson was seen lightly jogging before the start of play on day two and also batted in preparation for his duties at No 11. Stuart Broad, who revealed the previous evening that his strike-partner apologised for leaving his fellow bowlers a man down, tried to endorse this possibility during an interview with Sky. Broad, who led the attack in Anderson\u2019s absence and claimed figures of five for 86 in Australia\u2019s first innings, said: \u201cJimmy will be working desperately hard on ice and rehab. He said to me last night there\u2019s a chance he might bowl second innings. If the scan comes back and there\u2019s no major mark on it, he will strap it up and go. One thing we know about Jimmy is that if there\u2019s a chance of him bowling he will.\u201d One certainty is that Wood\u2019s summer is over. Ed Smith, the national selector, had hoped the Durham fast bowler might be fit for the back-end of the Ashes after suffering a side strain during the World Cup final. But the injury, picked up while bowling but then exacerbated when diving for a run off the last ball of England\u2019s tied run chase, is now deemed serious enough to make the winter tour to New Zealand a more realistic target for the 29-year-old\u2019s comeback. England confirmed that Wood underwent an operation to tidy up some torn cartilage in his left knee \u2013 a procedure that has a rehab period of a few weeks but could have been delayed had the original side strain settled down sooner. Jofra Archer, who required injections to battle through a side problem during the World Cup, took a wicket during his four overs for Sussex in their T20 win over Kent on Friday night. While yet to make his Test debut, England\u2019s leading wicket-taker in that campaign appears favourite to replace Anderson for the second Test at Lord\u2019s from 14 August provided he can demonstrate his readiness. Sam Curran, who offers a point of difference from his left-arm angle and pugnacious lower-order runs, and Olly Stone, the fast bowler who claimed three Ireland wickets on his debut last week, are the other candidates to step up among the current squad.

As a centrally contracted player, and having recommitted to first-class cricket, Rashid had been hopeful of forcing his way back into England\u2019s Test plans before the end of the season. Colin Graves and Tom Harrison, the respectively chairman and chief executive of the England and Wales Cricket Board, are due to appear in front of the digital, culture, media and sport committee on 23 October to outline how they intend to build on England\u2019s victory in the World Cup. The pair will be asked about participation, broadcasting rights and revenue, as well as plans for next year\u2019s new tournament, The Hundred, the concept which has thus far struggled to capture the public\u2019s imagination.",

The Bulgarian failed to meet the threshold of securing 65% of the EU\u2019s population in Friday\u2019s vote, which was carried out via email by officials in Europe\u2019s capitals. It had taken 12 hours to get the result after a series of votes to whittle down an initial shortlist of five. Dijsselbloem, who faced opposition from Spain, Italy and Greece over comments in 2017 in which he claimed that crisis-hit EU countries had wasted aid money on \u201calcohol and women\u201d, won the backing of 44% of the EU capitals. Sources at the Treasury had said it had been keen to manoeuvre Osborne into the running in behind-the-scenes negotiations but it ended up abstaining when a decision over a joint candidate was put to EU finance ministers for the vote. The poll had been opposed by the British government on the grounds that it was unnecessary to rush the process ahead of a September deadline. Nadia Calvi\u00f1o, the Spanish economy minister, Olli Rehn, the governor of the Bank of Finland, and M\u00e1rio Centeno, the Portuguese chairman of Eurozone finance ministers, all pulled out as the capitals made their intentions known.

Dijsselbloem, a Dutch socialist, won the support of Spain\u2019s centre-left government, led by the prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez, while Italy offered its backing to Georgieva. Earlier in the day, Mark Carney, the Bank of England\u2019s governor, had appeared to offer himself up for the role after being asked about his intentions on leaving his current job. He told the BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that the IMF role was \u201cextremely important\u201d. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind doing something when I leave \u2026 It is a time of consequence for the global economy, whether it\u2019s addressing inequalities, adjusting to a lower-carbon global economy, helping to get the world out of this very low-interest-rate, low-inflation, low-growth trap that we\u2019re in.

And she\u2019s joined at the leaders\u2019 shoulders by big-hitting Nelly Korda, who turns in 32, and the defending champion Georgia Hall, who has left her 2019 form behind and is keeping it resolutely 2018, playing the front nine in 33 this morning.</p> <p><em><strong>-7:</strong> Salas (9), Buhai<br><strong>-6:</strong> A Jutanugarn (12), Hall (11), N Korda (10), Shibuno, Kang</em></p> <p><strong>So let\u2019s waste no further time.</strong> Let\u2019s get out there.

      "bodyText": "Update! Update! And so it was a downbeat end to the round for Caroline Masson, who bogeyed the last hole. A 68, though, and she heads into the weekend at -7. But Ashleigh Buhai made two further birdies, at 15 and 16, coming home in 32 shots. A splendid 67 to go alongside her opening salvo of 65. That\u2019s given the top of the leaderboard a dramatically different look. All set for Moving Day tomorrow. We\u2019ll be here at midday. Hope to see you then! -12: Buhai -9: Shibuno -8: Salas -7: Law, Boutier, SH Park, Hull, Masson -6: A Jutanugarn, Hall, JY Ko, Ciganda, Kang This is the point where the television coverage comes to an abrupt halt. It\u2019s highly irritating to leave it here, with both Ashleigh Buhai and Caroline Masson yet to complete their rounds. But we promise to keep you updated, once we know how it all comes down. Thanks for reading, though, and we hope to see you all here tomorrow for Moving Day. -10: Buhai (13) -9: Shibuno -8: Salas, Masson (17) -7: Law, Boutier, S Park, Hull -6: A Jutanugarn, Hall, J Ko, Ciganda, D Kang -5: Lee6, N Korda, Alex, M Lee Moriya Jutanugarn has kept her slim hopes alive. Just. She started poorly today, with bogeys at 3 and 4. Things got much worse later, with a double-bogey seven at 11. But running repairs to her round were made at 15 and 16. A couple of birdies that limited today\u2019s damage to 74. She\u2019s -3, though the wise Jutanugarn cash will go on her sister Ariya, who is three shots better off at the halfway mark. Ashleigh Buhai becomes the first player to reach double digits this week! She rolls in a perfectly paced 30-footer from the front fringe at 13, and the 30-year-old South African takes sole ownership of the lead! Buhai is looking to become only the second South African to win a women\u2019s major, after 1980 PGA and 1988 du Maurier Classic winner Sally Little. But Little never played in the British Open, so Buhai would be breaking new ground. A lot of golf to play yet, of course. -10: Buhai (13) -9: Shibuno (F) -8: Salas (F), Masson (15) The 18th green is absolutely covered in flies. The buggers are everywhere! One of the benefits of not bothering with the high-definition channels, right here. It\u2019s like some sort of low-rent horror movie. Kang is nevertheless able to navigate her ball through the sea of insects and lag it up to kick-in distance. It\u2019s a closing bogey, all down to the poor drive. Still, she\u2019s signing for a 72 that keeps her at -6 after yesterday\u2019s 66. -9: Shibuno (F), Buhai (12) -8: Salas (F), Masson (15) -7: Law (F), Boutier (F), S Park (F), Hull (F) -6: A Jutanugarn (F), Hall (F), J Ko (F), Ciganda (F) A huge break for Ashleigh Buhai on 13. Her ball snagged halfway down the bank in thick rough, one bounce shy of leaping into all sorts of forest-based bother. She\u2019s able to take a crack for the green. A slight mishit means she\u2019s just shy of the dancefloor, but nevertheless she\u2019s got a great chance to get up and down to save her par. Bounce-back birdie for Caroline Masson on the par-five 15th. Two shots to the front, a chip up to a couple of feet, and in goes the putt. Textbook. She\u2019s -8 again. Meanwhile on 18, Danielle Kang takes her medicine and chips back out onto the fairway from the forest. There was no point whatsoever going for a spectacular escape there. But she\u2019s up against it now, and pressure causes her to pull her third. She finds the green, but it\u2019s an awfully long putt for par. She\u2019ll certainly not want to be walking off having made double. She\u2019s far from happy. Buhai is wild off the tee again. This one bounds off down a bank to the left of 13. There could be some serious trouble there. Bother for Kang on 18, too. Spooked by her short birdie miss on 17, she sends a big hook into the trees on the left. Up on the green, Lexi Thompson nearly rakes in a long birdie putt. But it\u2019s a par that ensures her 70 is blemish-free. She\u2019s -3 and the brilliant American is not out of this by a long chalk. Danielle Kang very nearly aces 17, sending her hybrid fizzing towards the flag. But it slips by the lip, and ends up five feet past. Still a great birdie opportunity, but she pulls her Scotty Cameron and a marvellous chance turns apologetically to the left. She remains at -7. Meanwhile Ashleigh Buhai looks to be in serious trouble on 12, having flayed her tee shot into the trees wide right. No matter! Buhai whips a glorious iron back out, across the water guarding the front of the green, and pin high to 12 feet! That\u2019s one of the shots of the week ... though she can\u2019t covert it to birdie, the putt dying lamely on the right. No sole ownership of the lead, then. She stays at -9. Charley Hull joins her compatriot Bronte Law at -7 after a two-putt par on 18 from the fringe. A 70 to go alongside yesterday\u2019s fine 67. Woburn\u2019s finest looks a little disappointed, but will surely perk up on reflection: she\u2019s well placed going into the weekend, and recovered valiantly after a mid-round wobble. Shanshan Feng, a runner up last week at the Evian, won\u2019t be here this weekend. But the 2012 PGA champion goes out with a bang, sending a tramliner into the cup for birdie on 18. A round of 71, but after yesterday\u2019s tired 75 she\u2019s taken at least one shot too many at +2. Bogey for this year\u2019s PGA champ, Hannah Green, but she signs for a 71 and at level par will make the cut. Ashleigh Buhai joins Hinako Shibuno at the top! Her second birdie of another very steady day, this time at the par-five 11th. Trouble for Caroline Masson at 14, though. She mishits her tee shot terribly, the ball dunking into the bunker guarding the front right of the green. She can only bash her ball out to 25 feet, and the effort to save par is always dying right and short. Bogey, and she\u2019s back down to -7. -9: Shibuno (F), Buhai (11) -8: Salas (F) There was a par for Minjee Lee, as well. The Aussie signs for a 68 that could have been even better hand her flat stick been really working. She\u2019s -5. But a closing bogey for Anna Nordqvist, the result of sending her drive behind a tree on the right. She slips back to -3 after a second round of 69. A garden-variety par for Hinako Shibuno up 18. Beaming to the last! She\u2019s really enjoying herself, seemingly unencumbered by the pressure of leading a major golf tournament on debut. Her 69 goes alongside yesterday\u2019s 66, and she is going to provide so much entertainment over the weekend. What a player Japan have on their hands here. She\u2019s performed quite brilliantly. Some quite frankly audacious approaches. A phalanx of photographers trail after her, dazzled by her obvious star quality. What a story it would be if she won this title! She\u2019s -9 going into the weekend. Charley Hull\u2019s tee shot at 17 flies wide right. She\u2019s stuck atop a grassy knoll, from where there\u2019s no easy chip down. She opens the face of her wedge wide, Mickelsons a long swing, and sends her ball landing softly six feet from the cup. That\u2019s a lovely touch from where she had found herself. In goes the par saver ... just, but they all count. She stays put at -7. She\u2019s done extremely well to get her round back on track after that wobble midway through the back nine. A third birdie in four holes for Caroline Masson! Her second into 13 isn\u2019t particularly close, but that putter is hot and she guides a 30-foot right-to-left slider into the cup. The 30-year-old German is one off the lead. I\u2019ll drink to that. Ewan Murray\u2019s at Woburn. Here\u2019s his take on England\u2019s dreaming. Par for Park Sung-hyun on 18. The world number two signs for a 70. She doesn\u2019t look in total control of her game - nothing\u2019s quite functioning to full effect - and yet she\u2019s just two off the lead. If she relocates her mojo, she could be hard to stop this weekend ... though it\u2019s possible that her final-day misery last week at the Evian may play on her mind should she find herself within striking distance of victory again. Shibuno splashes out delicately to six feet. The par putt\u2019s missable, with a big left-to-right curl despite the short distance. But it\u2019s judged to perfection. In it goes, and she remains a shot in the lead at -9. Par for Minjee Lee, who stays at -5. But Anna Nordqvist races in a 30-foot birdie effort and suddenly the Swede is right in this at -4. Caroline Masson hasn\u2019t done anything of note in the majors this year. But she\u2019s got a tie for third in the British Open on her CV - a couple of years ago at Kingsbarns - and is looking good for another tilt at the title this year. Birdies at 10 and 12 have suddenly catapulted her up to a tie for fourth at -7. Meanwhile a huge break for Charley Hull on 16. Her drive lands in thick rough on the left. That could be tricky. But she\u2019d be standing on a water sprinkler, and so it\u2019s a free drop. And she can drop on the shorter stuff. But you\u2019ve got to take advantage of your breaks, and she sends her second to 15 feet and knocks in the putt. She\u2019s followed back-to-back bogeys with back-to-back birdies! She\u2019s -7 again. Minjee Lee made birdie at 16 too. A fine approach knocked to eight feet, only made to look ordinary by Shibuno\u2019s antics. So she\u2019s finally up to -5. She then swishes her tee shot at 17 pin high, though it\u2019ll be a long putt across. Shibuno gives her effort too much welly, and she\u2019s in the bunker at the back of the green, a good lie but shortsided. Hinako Shibuno continues to wow the crowds. She clatters a huge drive down the middle of 16, then wedges to four feet. It\u2019s a sensational approach, but she\u2019s not minded to stand about admiring her own work. Instead, she again breaks into a run in order to pick up her divot and replace it. This sort of role-model behaviour will endear her to greenkeeping staff up and down the land. Her play isn\u2019t half bad either. In goes the putt - though only just, she nearly tugs it left but the hole snatches the ball just in time - and she laughs out loud at her effort. She\u2019s leading the British Open on debut! -9: Shibuno (16) -8: Salas (F), Buhai (9) -7: Law (F), Boutier (F), S Park (17), D Kang (14) Before Hull putts, she gets a read off Hannah Green, who makes a birdie putt from a similar spot. That birdie brings the PGA champion up to level par, and may go a long way to her surviving the cut. Having gone to school, Hull makes no mistake. She threatened to throw away a great chance of picking up a shot, but having got the job done in the end, will be feeling a lot better about herself suddenly. She\u2019s -6 again, just a couple off the lead. Hull can\u2019t quite make it to the green with her fairway wood. And then she chips up weakly, leaving herself a ten-footer for birdie. She looks agitated right now. This is a big birdie putt coming up. It could do so much to alter the mood music. Ahead of Hull, Minjee Lee has taken three textbook shots down 15 to set herself up with a three-foot birdie putt. She yips it. What a waste. Great frustration washes across her face as she remains stuck at -4. Hull is fuming at her recent profligacy. She swings so hard at her drive on the par-five 15th that she nearly takes her own head off with the follow-through. What a swing. Brooke Hendersonesque. Anyway, she\u2019s pearled that one a long way, and will be able to go for the green in two. (There hasn\u2019t been much of that yet this week, though the tees should move forward tomorrow in the hope of a bit more risk-reward eagle-chasing action.) The gods of golf didn\u2019t gift Marina Alex a birthday hole-in-one at 8. But a solid round isn\u2019t a bad consolation prize. She\u2019s just made her third birdie of the day, following up ones at 2 and 8 with the latest at the par-five 15th. She\u2019s -6. Meanwhile Ashleigh Buhai misses a six-foot birdie putt on 7 that would have given her sole ownership of the lead at -9. And Charley Hull walks off 14 with a face like thunder, as she fails to get up and down from a bank to the right of the green. A very average chip up followed by a poor putt from six feet, and that\u2019s back-to-back bogeys. She slips to -5 and the Woburn crowd fall silent as they watch one of their most famous members struggle. Shibuno\u2019s right up against the lip of the bunker, but she manages to whip it out to 12 feet. A decent result from there. But it\u2019s a testing putt that remains. No problem, though! After being made to wait for some time as the group behind play up, she slides the par saver, gently moving right to left, into the hole. She remains -8. Par too for her playing partners Minjee Lee - the Aussie trucking along nicely after birdies at 2, 4 and 13 - and Anna Nordqvist, the two-time major-winning Swede consolidating birdies at 9, 11 and 12. Lee is -4, Nordqvist a shot behind at -3. Charley Hull is never quite in position on 13. She eventually misses a six-footer to save her par, and slips back to -6. Meanwhile Hinako Shibuno shoves her hybrid into a bunker front right of the par-three 14th. She\u2019ll have her work cut out to get up and down from the deep trap to save her par. -8: Salas (F), Shibuno (13), Buhai (6) -7: Law (F), Boutier (F), S Park (14) -6: A Jutanugarn (F), Hall (F), J Ko (F), Ciganda (F), Hull (13), D Kang (11) -5: Lee6 (F), N Korda (F), Alex (14), Masson (9) Thanks John. And I\u2019m back in good time to see Park Sung-hyun scramble an unlikely par at 14. She misses the green on the left, then overhits her chip. Admittedly the ball briefly threatens to drop for birdie, but it just misses and sails a good 15 feet past. That\u2019s clumsy. But she nails the putt coming back, and remains at -7. That\u2019s her second big save of the day, after chipping in from the side of 9. She\u2019s not quite on her game today, but scrapping to stay in contention nonetheless. Nordqvist plays a putt off the edge of the green and it rather runs away with itself. She is not confident with her pitching shots and that lack of confidence betrays her. Her par putt is lengthy, and she takes her time. It was worth her time, and two wayward shots were rescued by a decent holding of the nerve. Hibuno settled for par, another well won. Minjee Lee, the final member of that trio, pulled off a birdie on that 13th hole, and is up to -4. And it\u2019s time to hand back to the maestro himself, Scott Murray. Shibuno was indeed in a bit of lumber. For her second shot, she has to address the ball around the tree and almost lands a beauty. Just a little more gas and that would have been beautiful. Nordqvist\u2019s shot, from a far better position, was far worse but both are off the green. Looks like the Swede topped that one a little. Buhai stays on -8 as she misses a birdie putt on the sixth. Charley Hull meanwhile, will not be joining that trio on -8. Her birdie attempt comes up just short, and she knew that from the moment she hit it. Kang looks somewhat dismayed as she has to settle for a par five on the tenth. Hibuno\u2019s drive on 13th may well have hit trouble, while Nordqvist, her partner, is able to land a far better lie. The Swede looks in control of her game while Hibuno is playing with the confidence to ride out any slight rick. Shibuno\u2019s attempt for birdie on the 12th swings this way and that on that riddle of a green but it falls short. A par is settled for. Charley Hull on the 12th plays a decent, safe three-wood to the centre of the fairway. Anna Nordqvist, meanwhile, has gone birdie, birdie, to go to -3 and the second of those owed much to a lovely approach shot on the 11th. Buhai shoots for the moon, well, the lead, on the fifth but the shot to the green left her too much to do. She will stay on the -8 grouping. The same goes for Hull, who has to settle for that five on 11. Kang\u2019s shot to the green on the tenth again is not quite close enough to the green to give her a chance to join the -8 grouping. Danielle Kang is just one shot off the lead now, having birdied the eighth. It is very tight at the top. One of those co-leaders on -8, Ashleigh Buhai, has just played a shot to the fourth that she looks a little disappointed with. Charley Hull, meanwhile, on the 11th, plays a decent chip on the par five. A birdie looks beyond her ken, though. She has a long putt to make a four. It\u2019s impossible not to fall for Hinako Shibuno. She sends her second into 10 to ten feet, taking up a divot half the size of Buckinghamshire as she does so. She then runs to her caddie, who has picked it up, and takes it off him before going to replace it. There are some professional players who can\u2019t even be bothered to shout fore. Shibuno is happy to get her hands dirty with on-course maintenance. She misses the resulting birdie putt, but that\u2019s not really the point. She\u2019s great fun, full of infectious energy. And with that, I\u2019m off to dig into a huge bowl of Hamburger Helper, the only food-flavored processed foodstuff to be marketed by a talking golf glove. Not sure the tagline of this commercial would fly today; nevertheless, out-of-date gender stereotyping never tasted so good. John Brewin will be your guide for the next 30 minutes or so. Enjoy! Park Sung-hyun doesn\u2019t like 11 at all. She bogeyed it yesterday, and does so again today. She can\u2019t get up and down from the back, following up that thinned bunker shot with a duffed chip. Her second attempt is much better, to six feet, and she knocks in the putt to limit the damage to a single shot. But she\u2019s no longer in the lead; she\u2019s -7. She\u2019s now alongside Danielle Kang, who is moving in a positive direction after back-to-back birdies at 7 and 8. -8: Salas (F), Shibuno (10), Buhai (2) -7: Law (F), Boutier (F), S Park (11), Hull (9), D Kang (8) \u201cA disappointing day for Megan Khang, but she\u2019s got game,\u201d argues Lucy Wesson. \u201cShe\u2019s been threatening for a while and with two top-ten finishes in the last two majors, I\u2019m not counting her out. She will bounce back this weekend! She\u2019ll break out with some wins, sooner rather than later, I sincerely hope. And I have a great feeling we will see her in Scotland for the Solheim! Thank you again for the excellent coverage. No Masson references yet today?\u201d Ah, no. Well, namesake Caroline\u2019s not long out, you see. But she has just birdied 4 to rise to -4. She\u2019s really jolly good. Trouble for Park Sung-hyun at the par-five 11th. Her second shot squirts into sand, a good distance from the green. Long bunker shots can put the fear of God into the best of them, and the former world number one skulls it, sending her ball flying hysterically over the green. She\u2019ll have a testing up and down from the back if she\u2019s to save her par. Birdie for Ashleigh Buhai at 2. She joins the leading group at -8, taking the place of Charley Hull, who sends her second shot at 9 into a deep greenside bunker, from where she fails to get up and down. She gives it a damn good go, mind you, powering out to 20 feet, about as good as she could manage, and nearly making the long par saver. It stopped right on the lip. But it\u2019s her first bogey of the week, and she slips back to -7. Last year\u2019s runner-up Pornanong Phatlum faces a tense few hours waiting to see whether she\u2019ll be here for the weekend. She\u2019s followed up a 73 with an equally average 72, and at +1 is currently going home. The projected cut is par ... ah hold on, it\u2019s just shifted to +1. Right now, she\u2019ll be teeing it up tomorrow. Well, that amply illustrates the sort of afternoon Phatlum is going to have, doesn\u2019t it. Meanwhile the 2017 champion IK Kim opened her round today with bogey, but has bounced back with birdies at 7 and now 11. She\u2019s -4. ... Park Sung-hyun knocks her approach at 10 to six feet, and rolls in the straight putt to take a four-way share of the lead. This is some leaderboard already! -8: Salas (F), S Park (10), Shibuno (8), Hull (8) -7: Law (F), Boutier (F), Buhai (1) Megan Khang ends with par and a 74. An off day for the young American, but she far from out of this yet. She goes into the weekend at -3. Meanwhile the overnight leader is out, and Ashleigh Buhai very nearly opens with a birdie. But her 20-foot putt stops a shade short. She remains at -7, one behind Salas, Shibuno ... and home favourite Charley Hull, who sends a fine tee shot at 8 over the flag, and smoothly holes the eight footer coming back. Updated leaderboard in a minute, because ... Shibuno\u2019s smile continues to shine across Woburn, even if the sun\u2019s disappeared momentarily behind the clouds. She lashes her iron at the par-three 8th straight at the flag, but it stops on the bank running across the green, 15 feet short of the cup. She very nearly teases in a big right-to-left breaker, but it stops a dimple shy. So close to taking the outright lead. Instead, she remains at -8, alongside the clubhouse leader Salas. -8: Salas (F), Shibuno (8) -7: Law (F), Boutier (F), S Park (9), Hull (7), Buhai -6: A Jutanugarn (F), Hall (F), J Ko (F), Ciganda (F) -5: Lee6 (F), N Korda (F), Alex (9), Kang (5) Park Sung-hyun looks to be in a bit of trouble at 9, wedging her fourth shot from the fringe. But she bundles the chip into the empty hole, the ball hitting the lip, leaping up and then disappearing down. An absurd par, and she turns in 34, -7 for the tournament. Park usually cuts an inscrutable figure, but here she allows herself a cheeky grin as she hands her club back to her caddie. Park has the biggest fan-base of pretty much any player on the tour, and there\u2019s plenty of screaming as she holes that chip. On another day of low scoring, there aren\u2019t many players going backwards. It\u2019s been a difficult day for Megan Khang, though. She opened this morning with bogeys at 1, 6 and 7, out in 39, and though she\u2019s since birdied 15, she\u2019s slipped to -3 today. And Moriya Jutanugarn has started slowly after yesterday\u2019s 67, dropping strokes at 3 and 4 to immediately clatter back to -3. Hinako Shibuno is so much fun to watch. She sends her second at the par-five 7th into a patch of parched rough way to the right of the fairway, halfway down a bank. The ball well below her feet. No matter. No stress. She simply wedges out gently from 100 yards to eight feet. That\u2019s just obscenely good. And she smiles her infectious smile again, enjoying every second of her maiden appearance at a major. The gallery seem to be enjoying her antics too, and there\u2019s a loud groan of disappointment as the birdie putt sails by on the right. Marina Alex only has one top-ten finish in the majors. A tie for ninth at this event back in 2014. The 29-year-old from New Jersey is enjoying her visit to Britain again this week. She came back in 33 yesterday on her way to a fine opening round of 69. It\u2019s her birthday today, and she nearly awards herself the perfect present on the 163-yard par-three 8th. A long iron crashed straight at the flag, the ball bouncing, checking, then rolling serenely towards the cup. The ball stops an inch to the right of the cup. Another roll and it was turning in. A hole-in-one\u2019s not to be, but she\u2019ll tap the shortest putt in for birdie and move to -5. Poor Lydia Ko is struggling badly right now. Ko won the 2015 Evain as an 18-year-old whirlwind, shooting 63 on the final day and becoming the youngest woman of all time to win a major title. Only Young Tom Morris, the 17-year-old winner of the 1868 Open, beats the Seoul-born New Zealander\u2019s record. She then followed it up with victory at the ANA Inspiration the following season. A long period of Sorenstamesque domination looked on the cards. But nothing\u2019s ever certain in golf. No majors since, and she\u2019s been well off the pace this year, her long game in particular giving her gyp. She shot 76 yesterday, and today followed that up with a miserable 80. At +12, she\u2019s rock bottom of the standings as things stand. Just as well it\u2019s the end of the majors season; time to go away and regroup. She\u2019ll be back. Par for Celine Boutier at the last. The 25-year-old from France, who performed so well at the US Open before stumbling on the Sunday, gets up and down from a tight lie to the right of the green, like Georgia Hall before her. She signs for a 66 and goes into the weekend at -7, just one off clubhouse leader Lizette Salas\u2019s lead. Hinako Shibuno continues to smile broadly. Her approach at 5 clatters the flagstick, and she knocks in a birdie putt from four feet. She\u2019s back into a share of the lead with Lizette Salas at -8. What a fine bounce-back birdie after an egregious three-putt at the last. She\u2019s clearly enjoying competing in her first major championship. Indeed, it\u2019s her first tournament on the LPGA tour. It\u2019s some debut, whatever happens from here on in. The recently deposed world number one, Park Sung-hyun, pings her tee shot at 6 to 12 feet, and rolls in the putt for her second birdie of the day. She\u2019s -7. And so is Charley Hull, who guides a downhill 20-footer into the cup at 4 for her second birdie of the afternoon. It\u2019s getting crowded at the top. -8: Salas (F) -7: Law (F), Boutier (17), SH Park (6), Shibuno (4), Hull (5), Buhai Carlota Ciganda posts yet another good round in a major. A 69, and it would have been one stroke better had her snaky 30-foot birdie effort on 18 taken one more turn. A fine tilt nevertheless. She\u2019s -6. Her quest to become Spain\u2019s first major winner will continue this weekend. Shibuno can\u2019t keep it going forever. Her second into 4 is very nice indeed, straight at the flag, 15 feet shy. But her birdie putt is strangely dreadful, only making it halfway to the hole, and way off line too. A real head-scratcher. And it costs her a shot, as she can\u2019t make the par putt. She slips out of the lead, back to -7, but still leaves the scene of the crime with a smile and a sunny disposition. Back-to-back birdies for the relentless Hinako Shibuno! She follows the one at 2 by wedging to eight feet at 3 and cleaning up. That\u2019s nine birdies in her last 14 holes! She grabs a share of the lead at -8 with Lizette Salas, who pars the final hole and signs for a blemish-free 67. -8: Salas (F), Shibuno (3) -7: Law (F), Boutier (16), Buhai -6: A Jutanugarn (F), Hall (F), JY Ko (F), Ciganda (17), SH Park (4), Hull (3), Kang (1) \u201cShit!\u201d Charley Hull can eff and jeff with the best of them, and here she is, forcing Sky Sports into one of their preposterous apologies, we\u2019re all adults, as she critiques her second into 2. It\u2019s wide right of the green. But she\u2019s able to get up and down from a grassy knoll, thanks to a gorgeous chip, and the early birdie takes her up to -6. Ko Jin-young sends her second at 18 into the deep bunker guarding the front right of the green. Her splash out isn\u2019t all that great; way too much sand, and she\u2019s well short of the cup. But you don\u2019t get to be world number one and a two-time major winner without moxie, and she rolls in the 25-foot left-to-right slider to save her par. That could be huge come the end of the week. A 70 today and she\u2019s -6. Meanwhile par for Nelly Korda and that\u2019s a 69. She\u2019s -5. -8: Salas (17) -7: Law (F), Boutier (15), Shibuno (2), Buhai -6: A Jutanugarn (F), Hall (F), JY Ko (F), Ciganda (15), SH Park (4), Kang Hinako Shibuno came back in 30 strokes yesterday on her major-championship debut. The 20-year-old from Japan doesn\u2019t seem fazed by the step up at all, though that shouldn\u2019t be such a huge surprise as she comes with rave notices from those in the know on her home tour. Birdie at 2, and she keeps that upward momentum going. She\u2019s -7. Meanwhile Celine Boutier lands a full wedge over the flag at the par-five 15th. The ball grips, spins back, rolls over her own pitch mark, and into the cup! Eagle! She\u2019s suddenly -7 and right in this tournament now. Ko Jin-young is looking to win two majors in eight days, and three in a four months. This season\u2019s ANA Inspiration and Evian Championship winner knocks her tee shot at 17 to 12 feet, then nails the putt to move into a share of fourth at -6. If she hadn\u2019t double bogeyed 14 yesterday, with that ludicrous four-putt, she\u2019d be sharing the lead right now with Lizette Salas. Worth remembering that four-putts needn\u2019t be the end of the world: Phil Mickelson won the 2013 Open after taking four putts on the par-three 16th at Muirfield on the Friday. A 69 for Georgia Hall, who gets up and down from the side of 18 for her par, after pushing her second towards the stand on the right. That could be so important for her title defence, because a bogey-bogey finish would have seriously deflated her. She goes into the weekend at -6. Meanwhile a one-under round of 71 for Brooke Henderson. She\u2019s -4, reasonably placed at the halfway mark. Celine Boutier of France is putting a fine round together. Birdies at 4, 8, 11 and 13 take her up to -5. Boutier came close at the US Open this year, leading going into Sunday, only to double bogey the opening hole of her final round. She never really got going again after that. It was the 25-year-old\u2019s first experience of the business end of a major, though. Plenty to help her keep it up this week. The 2016 conqueror of Woburn, Ariya Jutanugarn, nearly drains a monster birdie putt on 18. But it\u2019s just a tap-in par, and she\u2019s scribbling her signature at the bottom of a 70. -8: Salas (14) -7: Law (F), Buhai -6: A Jutanugarn (F), Hall (17), Ciganda (13), Kang, Shibuno No, it\u2019s too much to ask. The putt slips by on the right, and that\u2019s Hall\u2019s first bogey of the week. She\u2019s -6. Meanwhile Nelly Korda makes bounce-back birdie at 15. She\u2019s -5 and there\u2019s a spring in her step again. Hall opts for a bump and run with an 8-iron. But she still ends up half-lobbing the ball into the air, and it dies softly as it hits the green, halfway to the hole. She\u2019s left with a 20-footer for her par. She made one of these par savers from similar distance at this hole yesterday, having come up short. Can she escape again? Georgia Hall hasn\u2019t dropped a shot yet this week either. But she\u2019s got her work cut out to maintain that proud record at 17. She sets her tee shot at the par-three too far out to the left, and catches the branches of a tree. Her ball drops down, stunned. She\u2019s well short of the green, left with a testing up and down to scramble her par. Par for Bronte Law at the last, and she\u2019s signing for a fine 67. The 24-year-old from Stockport is still to drop a shot this week, and she\u2019s the new leader in the clubhouse at -7. One of the putts of the week by Carlota Ciganda! A huge right-to-left breaker from 30 feet on 12, the ball trundling along a circumference and into the cup. One of those where you think ... no chance ... surely not ... hold on, that\u2019s going in ... it\u2019s there! Absolute plumb centre. Such an aesthetically and mathematically pleasing route to the hole. She\u2019s -6. But a three-putt bogey for Nelly Korda on 14, whose round is beginning to unravel after a fast start of four birdies in the first seven holes. THat\u2019s her second bogey in three, and she slips to -4. The defending champ Georgia Hall doesn\u2019t threaten the flag with her approach to the par-five 15th. But her putter is red hot, and she makes the right-to-left curler from 20 feet and joins her compatriot Bronte Law in second spot at -7. Meanwhile up on 18, the US Open champion Jeongeun Lee6 arrows her second to a couple of feet. For a second it looked like it was going to roll in for eagle. But when she tidies that up for birdie, she\u2019ll be signing for a one-under 71, and it\u2019ll give her the early clubhouse lead at -5. Back-to-back birdies for Carlota Ciganda at 10 and 11, as she continues her relentless pursuit of a first major title for Spain. It\u2019s got to happen sometime, you\u2019d think, so consistent is the 29-year-old from Pamplona. She reached the 11th green in two huge smashes, and her 30-foot eagle putt wasn\u2019t too far away at all. She\u2019s -5. Bronte Law is this close to making it three birdies in a row and grabbing a share of the lead. Having found the rough down the right of 16, she guides her second into the heart of the green, pretty much the best result possible from the angle she was coming in, the pin tucked behind a bunker on the left. The resulting 30-foot putt stops a couple of inches short. She remains at -7. Meanwhile just the par for Salas on 12. She shakes her head as she walks off the green, having clearly fancied getting up and down from 70 yards or so. The leader Salas wedges her second at 12 to 20 feet. She looks thoroughly disgusted with herself, illustrating the level she\u2019s been playing at today. Meanwhile Ariya Jutanugarn continues to see-saw, dropping a stroke at 14, then failing to threaten birdie at the par-five 15th, quite the disappointment for such a long hitter. She\u2019s back to -6. Back-to-back birdies for Bronte Law! She sends her third at the par-five 15th to 15 feet, then makes the gentle left-to-right slider to move to -7. Nelly Korda slips to -5 after finding the trees off the tee at 12. And the world number one is quietly nudging her way into the thick of it. Ko Jin-young started slowly this morning, with bogey at 3, but birdies at 8 and now 12 have pushed her up to -5. Close study of the last leaderboard shows Ariya Jutanugarn back at -7. Thailand\u2019s first major-winning golfer already has a British Open to her name - she won it here in 2016. And she\u2019s looking to repeat the trick. Birdie at 13, and she\u2019s just a shot off Salas\u2019s lead. Meanwhile it\u2019s been a productive morning for Maria Torres. The first LPGA star from Puerto Rico nearly aced 14 yesterday, and continues to entertain today, hitting the turn in 33. She\u2019s -3 overall. It\u2019s a lovely day at Woburn. Warm, the sun poking through the clouds, and very little wind. It looks like it\u2019s going to be another day of low scoring. So having said that, Georgia Hall lets a 12-foot birdie chance slide by the cup on 13. But she\u2019s still going along nicely at -6, yet to drop a shot this week. Another birdie for Bronte Law, this time at the par-three 14th. It momentarily gives her a share of second place, but then Lizette Salas, the 30-year-old from Azusa, California near the Mexican border on Route 66, birdies 10 to snatch the outright lead for herself. Salas\u2019s best performance at a major was her tie for fifth at this year\u2019s PGA, but she\u2019s also got a sixth-place finish at this event on her resume, back in 2013 on the Old Course at St Andrews no less. She also sunk the winning putt at the 2017 Solheim Cup. Could this be the next step up? -8: Salas (10) -7: A Jutanugarn (13), Buhai -6: Law (14), Hall (12), N Korda (10), Shibuno, Kang It\u2019s also been a good morning for English hope Bronte Law. The 24-year-old from Stockport trudged off the 18th last night a bit downcast, having missed a good birdie chance. But she was still signing for a bogey-free 70. And she\u2019s still to drop a shot this week. Birdies at 1, 5 and 10, the rest pars, and she\u2019s -5 through 13. Come to Milton Keynes, they told the best golfers in the world. And come they have, to cook up something special on the Marquess Course at Woburn. This is already shaping up to be a fantastic tournament. After a low-scoring opening round, with some fine attacking golf on display, the top of the leaderboard looked like this ... -7: Buhai -6: Shibuno, Kang -5: SH Park, Hull, M Jutanugarn, Khang -4: Lee6, A Jutanugarn, JY Ko ... but it hasn\u2019t taken long for some dramatic changes to have occurred this morning! Lizette Salas, who came close at the PGA earlier this year, burst out of the blocks with four birdies on the bounce. That\u2019s given her a share of the lead. Ariya Jutanugarn was up there with Salas and surprise overnight leader Ashleigh Buhai, having reached the turn this morning in 33, but bogey at 11 has dropped her back to a shot off. And she\u2019s joined at the leaders\u2019 shoulders by big-hitting Nelly Korda, who turns in 32, and the defending champion Georgia Hall, who has left her 2019 form behind and is keeping it resolutely 2018, playing the front nine in 33 this morning. -7: Salas (9), Buhai -6: A Jutanugarn (12), Hall (11), N Korda (10), Shibuno, Kang So let\u2019s waste no further time. Let\u2019s get out there. It\u2019s on!",

Cricket fever was back and I taped up a couple of tennis balls and got together some friends to play cage cricket. A couple of Englishmen, an Aussie, an Italian and a German, the latter two having never played before. </p> <p>\u201cIt was such a hit that the Italian bowled out one of the Englishmen at the end of a brilliant over of spin and he scored a fair few runs to boot. As for the German, she was an enthusiastic fielder, with pinpoint throws, always backing up at the bowler\u2019s end and scoring lovely boundaries off straight drives. She and I both do HEMA (Historical European Martial Arts) with the longsword and it turns out that an Unterhau is pretty much a drive from cricket. The only difference is the footwork, since feet first when wielding a longsword means that your opponent chops off your knee.<br>  \u201cAll in all a brilliant morning session of cricket that ended when yours truly tried to bring up his century with a six and launched the ball out of the football cage and onto the local train passing nearby.\u201d</p> <p>That last scene is straight from Wes Anderson\u2019s next film.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d446e298f0896be8f8f23b5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-02T17:11:57.183Z\">6.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>85th over: England 254-4 (Burns 119, Stokes 31) </strong>The crowd are cheering every defensive stroke - or, to put it in layman\u2019s terms, booze sales have been good today.

I was a young student in Leeds with an already long history in club cricket and a Test match-obsessed father. Being the dutiful son I am, I purchased two tickets for the second day of the Headingley Test in my first year against New Zealand. What followed was one of the worst days of Test cricket I have ever seen with an absolute abomination of a hundred scored by a young Kiwi upstart. It was a truly awful knock. He didn\u2019t middle one all day and both myself, and my father, walked away from the ground drunk hoping to never have to watch that poor excuse for a cricketer again.

England will want a big first-innings lead as Lyon insurance, as he\u2019ll be a handful in the fourth innings.<strong> </strong></p> <p>\u201cWanting to get in first with this, but leaving out Starc and Hazlewood, wtf?\u201d says Pete Salmon. \u201cThis has been sold as a terrific paradigm shift by Australia, but it seemed nuts at the toss, and even more nuts now. And do I remember rightly how cross they both were after Warner fingered them for sandpaper-gate? Kicked out of their WhatApp group etc. Will this be one of those things where when Aus lose the series 3-0 we find out how ugly it was in the dressing room? When it\u2019s no longer useful for us to know?\u201d</p> <p>I can see the logic, personally. Starc\u2019s red-ball form has been mixed, Hazlewood is coming back from injury (and didn\u2019t bowl that well in 2015), and Pattinson and Siddle have form in English conditions. There\u2019s also rotation to consider. I think they\u2019ve been a bit unfortunate, too - had Siddle bowled in yesterday\u2019s conditions, for example, he could have run riot.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d44427b8f08c7e177d436e8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-02T14:08:11.935Z\">3.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>48th over: England 152-1 (Burns 75, Root 57) </strong>Root tucks Cummins to the fine-leg boundary to reach an important, controlled <strong>half-century </strong>from 110 balls.

There was an LBW appeal too, as it was pad first, but it hit him well outside the line of off stump.</p> <p>An eventful over continues when <strong>Burns survives a run-out chance</strong>. He had given up and was well short of his ground when Khawaja\u2019s throw from backward point missed the stumps.

Some movement in towards Root\u2019s pads, some seam away after pitch. Beats the groping outside edge, nearly clips the pad, then hits the outside of the stump. But the bails don\u2019t fall. The umpire thinks it\u2019s a nick, and fair enough, and gives Root out. The DRS review confirms that the off stump was hit right on the outside at the top, and moved substantially inward, then back again. The angle of movement meant that the bail spigot just slid along the groove. Pattinson can\u2019t believe it, and inspects the bails for foul play.

If somebody has concussion then another head injury can be extremely risky as the brain is already damaged. It\u2019s like hitting a bruise, it hurts more and causes more damage to the brain so they need taking out of the game entirely. Having a concussion substitute means a team is less likely to risk carrying on with a player at higher risk of long term brain damage. Aggravating a muscle injury isn\u2019t as severe and the player can often carry on in some way (eg Anderson is likely to be able to bat).\u201d</p> <p>Which is all true, it\u2019s just less funny. <br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-02T11:16:33.963Z\">at 12.16pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d4412ef8f0896be8f8f1eff\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-02T10:42:11.740Z\">11.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>10th over: England 26-1 (Burns 12, Root 3)</strong> James Pattinson has been run through the hot wash, given a fresh coat of wax, and he\u2019s absolutely gleaming.

James Pattinson and Pat Cummins operating at pace, Siddle with smarts, Lyon to extract turn from a pitch that did spin yesterday. England with three of their top six yet to prove themselves at this level, and one or two of them hovering perilously near the drop.</p> <p>Everything is set up to be a brilliant day at the Ashes.

Thanks for your company and emails - night! More from Rory Burns \u201cI haven\u2019t faced Nathan Lyon before. I just wanted to see what his variations were and how he was gonna try to move me around the crease. I felt most comfortable staying a little bit leg side of the ball. You could almost see him go up and try to hit the shit\u2026 sorry, hit the rough a little bit, and then when he was trying to slide one on to hit the pad. \u201cThey\u2019ve still got a newish ball and we\u2019re still behind. If we get our noses in front we\u2019ll try to make it as big as we can.\u201d The centurion Rory Burns is chatting on Sky Sports \u201cQuite an enjoyable experience, that. It was awesome. The Hollies Stand was rocking and it was quite an experience. There\u2019s been a lot of hard work from a lot of people \u2013 not just myself but also coaches, parents and other people. That\u2019s for them. I was wrestling with myself on 99, telling myself not to sweep. I was just waiting for something in my arc. For me that\u2019s probably quite an emotional response \u2013 I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever thrown my hands in celebration. \u201cThere was something there for the bowlers all day. It\u2019s quite a slow, sticky pitch. The ball change helped them as well, when it started swinging. You have to wait to get something in your area. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to embrace opportunities as they come, and I wanted to put myself in a better position to do that here. I was struggling with my rhythm and balance against Ireland at Lord\u2019s. Sometimes it just takes a couple of hours at the crease to get that good feeling back.\u201d England trail by 17 runs with six first-innings wickets remaining That was an old-fashioned opener\u2019s Test hundred from Burns, who showed a lot of mental clarity, never mind strength. Australia\u2019s bowlers didn\u2019t do much wrong, but there was little assistance apart from a short period after the old ball was changed. They had no luck, either - Root was bowled without the bails coming off, Burns survived an LBW appeal that would have been out had they reviewed, and the ball went past the edge at least 50 times. 90th over: England 267-4 (Burns 125, Stokes 38) That\u2019s the end of a fine day for England, and especially Rory Burns. He batted throughout to make his maiden Test century, and a number of the Australian players congratulate him before he walks off to a standing ovation. 89th over: England 265-4 (Burns 125, Stokes 37) Siddle looks weary. It\u2019s been extremely hard work for the Diet Coke men, Cummins and Pattinson, so it must be even tougher for a 34-year-old grimacer. He should be happy with his day\u2019s work, though: he has figures of 21-5-43-1, and the one was Joe Root. There are four overs remaining, but we won\u2019t get them all because play will finish at 6.30pm. This over, from Peter Siddle, might be the last of the day. 88th over: England 265-4 (Burns 125, Stokes 36) Breaking news: Rory Burns will sleep well tonight. He must have expended so much mental energy. He is beaten by yet another jaffa from Lyon. According to the Sky Sports scorer Benedict Bermange, that\u2019s the 34th time he\u2019s played and missed today. \u201cHope you\u2019re enjoying this as much as I,\u201d says Bill Hargreaves. \u201cI can\u2019t believe how little work I\u2019ve got done today. The dogs are unwalled and the floors unhoovered, never mind very little actual work done. It is, however, only the bloody second day of a new Ashes series and the place is rocking.\u201d It shows how long a day it\u2019s been that I spent around five minutes wondering what walling the dogs means before I realised the L and K are next to each other on the keyboard. 87th over: England 263-4 (Burns 123, Stokes 37) Siddle replaces Pattinson, who has figures of 17-2-54-2 on his return to Test cricket. Stokes, on the walk, works Siddle round the corner for four. It might be an illusion, because I can\u2019t get the bloody World Cup out of my head, but it feels like Stokes is batting with greater assurance and authority than in recent Test series. \u201cThe World Cup was incredible,\u201d says Guy Hornsby, responding to my response in the 79th over. \u201cHonestly still get my head around it - as you know - but I\u2019m not sure I could handle one for at least another 47 months. And I can\u2019t listen to that song again. For all sorts of reasons.\u201d Maybe a blast of Pharrell over the tannoy instead? Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth? 86th over: England 259-4 (Burns 123, Stokes 32) With seven overs remaining, Nathan Lyon returns to the attack. Burns tries to cut a wide grubber and bottom-edges it between Paine\u2019s legs for four. A few deliveries from Lyon have kept low, which is unusual on the second day of a game. England trail by 25 runs. \u201cInspired by the story of Sarah O\u2019Regan at 16:35, here\u2019s one about cricket in Berlin,\u201d says Milind Pania. \u201cI fell back in love with cricket during the World Cup. Cricket fever was back and I taped up a couple of tennis balls and got together some friends to play cage cricket. A couple of Englishmen, an Aussie, an Italian and a German, the latter two having never played before. \u201cIt was such a hit that the Italian bowled out one of the Englishmen at the end of a brilliant over of spin and he scored a fair few runs to boot. As for the German, she was an enthusiastic fielder, with pinpoint throws, always backing up at the bowler\u2019s end and scoring lovely boundaries off straight drives. She and I both do HEMA (Historical European Martial Arts) with the longsword and it turns out that an Unterhau is pretty much a drive from cricket. The only difference is the footwork, since feet first when wielding a longsword means that your opponent chops off your knee. \u201cAll in all a brilliant morning session of cricket that ended when yours truly tried to bring up his century with a six and launched the ball out of the football cage and onto the local train passing nearby.\u201d That last scene is straight from Wes Anderson\u2019s next film. 85th over: England 254-4 (Burns 119, Stokes 31) The crowd are cheering every defensive stroke - or, to put it in layman\u2019s terms, booze sales have been good today. England have generally looked comfortable against the second new ball, although Burns is beaten when he tries to drive Pattinson. Australia\u2019s bowlers have been excellent today. 84th over: England 250-4 (Burns 117, Stokes 30) Stokes walks down the track to Cummins and is beaten by a monstrous seaming lifter. His response, later in the over, is a glorious, hold-the-pose straight drive for four. This is a superb contest between world cricket\u2019s premier indefatigables. 83rd over: England 243-4 (Burns 117, Stokes 23) That was a relatively poor over from Pattinson, who didn\u2019t make Burns play enough. Here\u2019s John Starbuck. \u201cPresumably, if it isn\u2019t already, Rory Burns\u2019 new nickname must be Slow.\u201d In more ways than one. It pitched well outside leg, so Australia lose a review. They have one left. Australia review for LBW against Burns! Burns survives a huge LBW appeal from Pattinson. I reckon this pitched outside leg - but Tim Paine goes for the review with two seconds remaining. 82nd over: England 242-4 (Burns 117, Stokes 22) Pat Cummins takes the new ball. Burns leaves on length a ball that hits the flap of the pad and flies to the boundary. Not that Englan get any runs: it\u2019s a dead ball, as he wasn\u2019t playing a shot. Burns has faced 258 balls in this innings. Not many England openers, Sir Alastair Cook aside, have done that since Andrew Strauss retired. Only three, in fact. Here\u2019s your friend and m- here\u2019s Mac Millings. \u201c\u201cYou will be pleased to know, Rob, that a review of \u2018Kaiser!: The Greatest Footballer Never to Play Football\u2019 has just been submitted to Amazon, describing you as \u2018the Wodehouse de nos jours\u2019.\u201d 81st over: England 242-4 (Burns 117, Stokes 22) Burns survives a precautionary run-out referral after being sent back by Stokes. That\u2019s the start of a tricky over for England. Burns, done in the flight, gets a leading edge short of cover before Stokes just jabs his bat down on a grubber. And I mean just. That was very close to another comedy LBW. Meanwhile, here\u2019s some news on England\u2019s ever-depleting seam-bowling pool. 80th over: England 241-4 (Burns 116, Stokes 22) A maiden from Head. The new ball is available, but Lyon will continue with the old one for now. \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Nico Bentley. \u201cAll this talk of Brendon McCullum reminds me of when I first saw him play back in 2004. I was a young student in Leeds with an already long history in club cricket and a Test match-obsessed father. Being the dutiful son I am, I purchased two tickets for the second day of the Headingley Test in my first year against New Zealand. What followed was one of the worst days of Test cricket I have ever seen with an absolute abomination of a hundred scored by a young Kiwi upstart. It was a truly awful knock. He didn\u2019t middle one all day and both myself, and my father, walked away from the ground drunk hoping to never have to watch that poor excuse for a cricketer again. That cricketer was you-know-who and we still have the taste of humble pie in our mouths.\u201d Are you sure you haven\u2019t confused him with Michael Papps? 79th over: England 241-4 (Burns 116, Stokes 22) Burns mistimes a slog-sweep off Lyon, but it clears mid-on and runs away for a couple. The second new ball will be available in one over\u2019s time. There\u2019s a storm a-comin. \u201cWe all loved the outrageous, what-the-eff-just-happened adrenaline shot of the World Cup, but this is sipping a fine claret with a plentiful cheese selection great,\u201d says Guy Hornsby. \u201cIt feels so absolutely right. And we\u2019re only two days in, and it feels like about five matches in one. I guess the next one happens a few overs time, with Aussies desperate to get back into it. The best games are the ones you never really know if you\u2019re ahead. Well, best unless you\u2019re the captain.\u201d A few months ago I\u2019d have agreed with you, but the World Cup changed me. Any chance we could have a blast of Loryn feat. Rudimental between overs? 78th over: England 239-4 (Burns 114, Stokes 22) Wade is replaced by another part-timer, the offspinner Travis Head. Burns belts a piece of filth for four. \u201cAh, really feeling like the Ashes now,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cSunny Friday evening, a week\u2019s work behind me, and an exciting Test match. Brilliant. The last series was slightly ruined for me by the fact that I started a new job, meaning I had many nights of trying to decide just how irresponsibly late I should stay up, trying to make sure I wasn\u2019t leaving myself too exhausted to make a good impression on my new employers. (By now, of course, my feet are suitably under-the-desk enough that I can lock my office door, put on TMS, read the OBO, and plod through my work.) But now, I have a free weekend, and the Ashes shall be enjoyed. Happiest of happy days.\u201d Richie Cunningham over here. 77th over: England 232-4 (Burns 109, Stokes 20) Stokes, who is playing nicely, laps Lyon for four more. This game is beautifully poised. There are 15 overs remaining tonight, and if Australia pick up two wickets with the new ball I think they\u2019ll be fairly happy. \u201cI too was intrigued by the Cremation promo flashing up opposite us earlier (Matt Bell over 58),\u201d says Brian Withington. \u201cI can second your observation that a funeral business can indeed screw up. Our West Midlands service provider went bust, retaining possession of my Dad\u2019s ashes. After much fruitless pursuit we finally got a call from a friendly neighbourhood bailiff who had entered the premises on behalf of the landlord. He didn\u2019t find much worth seizing but did discover half a dozen urns of which Dad\u2019s was the easiest surname to locate locally.\u201d 76th over: England 228-4 (Burns 109, Stokes 16) Matthew Wade, one-time wicketkeeper, comes on to bowl an over or two of medium pace. His first-class record is reasonable (eight wickets at 32). And although his first over is a bit of a mess, he almost bags a bonus wicket when Burns clunks a pull over mid-on for two. For a split-second that looked like it might go to hand. 75th over: England 221-4 (Burns 104, Stokes 15) Stokes sweeps Lyon firmly and authoritatively for four. It\u2019ll be fascinating to see whether his Test batting, which hasn\u2019t been great in the last couple of years, is empowered by all those superb innings he played during the World Cup. \u201cAbsolutely chuffed to bits for Rory Burns,\u201d says Phil Sawyer. \u201cAlso, according to TMS, that century means that Surrey now draw level with Yorkshire in terms of number of England test centurions (22, I think they said). Boycott didn\u2019t sound too pleased at the prospect. As a Lancastrian, this makes me very happy.\u201d When you say \u2018also\u2019... 74th over: England 216-4 (Burns 103, Stokes 11) Burns is beaten, flashing very loosely at a wide tempter from Siddle. That was the shot of a man who\u2019s just made his maiden Test hundred, and whose mind is playing Hall &amp; Oates. \u201cHow good is proper cricket?\u201d asks Jason Ali. \u201cAlongside Pink Floyd\u2019s Dark Side of the Moon, Wren\u2019s St Paul\u2019s, Guinness, and rhubarb crumble and custard it has to be one of mankind\u2019s greatest creations.\u201d Agreed. Although improper cricket has its moments. 73rd over: England 215-4 (Burns 102, Stokes 11) Stokes, trying to cut Lyon, edges just over the head of Bancroft at gully and away for four. Bancroft responds by putting on a helmet. \u201cWhat\u2019s the score,\u201d says Paul Godfrey, \u201csince they changed the ball?\u201d It is... 30 for two from 13 overs. 72nd over: England 210-4 (Burns 101, Stokes 7) Stokes gets his first boundary with a stylish, wristy back cut off Siddle. That\u2019s drinks. \u201cPlenty of Australian players applauding Rory Burns which, given how much luck he has enjoyed, was pretty decent,\u201d says Gary Naylor. \u201cI suspect they recognise something of their own much vaunted ticker in that knock. I hope Chris Rogers, another left-handed opener who scored plenty of Ashes runs and didn\u2019t care for Impostor Syndrome, had a wry smile too.\u201d I suspect Graham Gooch does. It\u2019s not how\u2026 71st over: England 205-4 (Burns 100, Stokes 3) There was a lovely roar from the crowd when Rory Burns made his hundred, while Jason Roy on the balcony could not have looked happier had he scored a century himself. Burns has achieved something that will make him happy for the rest of his days, because you are never a former Test centurion. That\u2019s in the Wisden Almanack forever. Until they put it all online and get rid of the records section completely. Bloody progress. \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Jessica Morgan. \u201cShould Australia, or anyone, be allowed to change the ball when the new ball is soon due?\u201d They are only allowed if the umpires decide the old ball has gone out of shape. It\u2019s all a bit of a lottery, but cricket is full of such variables \u2013 England, for example, benefitted from helpful overhead conditions yesterday. As they say in the leafier parts of Surrey, ya dancer! Rory Burns works Lyon for a quick single to reach his first century in his eighth Test. It\u2019s been a triumph of patience, self-awareness, mental strength and, yes, good fortune. It\u2019s hard not to be utterly thrilled for a bloke who had to wait so long to play Test cricket, and who a week ago would have been dreading a call from Ed Smith. There was actually a run-out referral when Burns reached his hundred, but he knew he was home and he celebrated long before the third umpire gave him not out. 70th over: England 203-4 (Burns 99, Stokes 2) Stokes works Siddle\u2019s fourth ball for a single, but Burns can\u2019t get a single off either of the last two deliveries. \u201cHello Rob,\u201d says Geoff Wignall. \u201cWasn\u2019t that Amazon review referencing Barbara Wodehouse?\u201d 69th over: England 202-4 (Burns 99, Stokes 1) Burns stays on 99 after a maiden from Lyon. He was beaten twice by delicious deliveries, both of which had the spinner\u2019s hat-trick of drift, turn and bounce. 68th over: England 202-4 (Burns 99, Stokes 1) Cummins goes around the wicket to Burns, who touches a poor delivery off the pads for four. A single takes him to 99. Ninety-nine. Ninety-nine. We take sporting achievement for granted, but just imagine his internal monologue right now. He\u2019s one away from a maiden Test century, on his Ashes debut, barely a week after many people said his Test career was over. Here\u2019s Savraj Grewal. \u201cThat sequence of events described by Sarah O\u2019Regan in the 63rd over was pretty much the only thing missing from the last 20 minutes of the World Cup final.\u201d 67th over: England 197-4 (Burns 94, Stokes 1) Nathan Lyon replaces Pattinson, which is a surprise given how much the replacement ball is doing. There are two left-handers at the crease, which must be the reason. His first ball is too short, which allows Burns to cut his first run in 19 deliveries. He gets it spot on later in the over, beating Burns with a seductive, dipping off-break. That was gorgeous bowling, though the rest of the over was pretty ordinary. 66th over: England 194-4 (Burns 92, Stokes 0) We\u2019re into phase three of this fascinating match. Since the ball change, England are 9-2 from six overs. In that time, Cummins has figures of 3-3-0-1. \u201cHello Rob,\u201d says Dave Seare. \u201cI like this new ICC initiative to spark the game into life with an extra new ball after 60 overs.\u201d This is magnificent stuff from Pat Cummins, who has gone up 5mph since the ball change. Buttler, squared up by some sharp movement, edges low towards gully and is beautifully caught by Cameron Bancroft. That was a classic fast-bowler\u2019s dismissal - the line and length were immaculate as well - and Buttler was blameless. 65th over: England 194-3 (Burns 92, Buttler 5) Ah, apparently the replacement balls are also from this year\u2019s batch. Either way, Australia have picked a good one. Pattinson continues to probe outside the off stump of Burns, who leaves as often as possible. He\u2019s been stuck on 92 for 17 balls, though he doesn\u2019t look particularly perturbed. \u201cYou should NEVER trust online \u2018reviews\u2019,\u201d says Martin Coult. \u201cThey are often \u2018planted\u2019 (often by robot) to boost the service/trader\u2019s ratings OR They originate with the service/trader\u2019s competitors who want to show them in a poor light.\u201d You say that, but the Amazon review describing Rob Smyth as the Wodehouse de nos jours was from a verified purchase, so. 64th over: England 193-3 (Burns 92, Buttler 4) Burns, lunging forward optimistically, is beaten on the inside by Cummins, who then goes past the outside edge on a couple of occasions. That was a brilliant over. This ball is doing a lot more, in the air and off the pitch. Nasser Hussain reckons the replacement balls are from last year\u2019s Duke batch, which moved a lot more; if that\u2019s the case, both teams will be at the umpires throughout the series. 63rd over: England 193-3 (Burns 92, Buttler 4) I think it was seam movement rather than swing that did for Denly. Either way, Pattinson has got this replacement ball chatting. This is a dangerous time for England because he has the ability to take wickets in clusters. Whatever the match situation, however, a half-volley is a half-volley, and Buttler gets off the mark by lacing Pattinson to the cover boundary. \u201cSpeaking of over rates, recently I played an innings of exactly one ball,\u201d says Sarah O\u2019Regan. \u201cWe were out in the back field under a blistering French sky. One bowler (boyfriend), one batsperson (me), two fielders (one Frenchman, one dog). Boyfriend bowls me a yorker which, being a tennis ball, bounces handily up. I give it a good smack across the field. Watson (dog, not Frenchman) goes sprinting after it - great fielding, we all thought - but then he snatches it up, crosses the boundary, runs into the house and gets straight into bed. The question is, did I score four runs or not?\u201d According to Law 19.2.4, that\u2019s four runs for the batsperson and a Cumberland sausage for Watson. Joe Denly is on his way. He played around a superb, full-length nipbacker from Pattinson and was given out LBW by Joel Wilson. Denly was angling for a review but Burns persuaded him otherwise. It looked plumb. 62nd over: England 189-2 (Burns 92, Denly 18) No swing for Cummins in that over, and Burns defends solidly. A maiden. \u201cThe ball is 62 overs old and the bowlers are tired,\u201d says Hugh Molloy. \u201cThat\u2019s when Jason Roy should be unleashed.\u201d Yes, I think he and Denly should swap places. But this innings isn\u2019t particularly representative of England\u2019s batting. There are some recent Tests in which, if Roy wanted to come to the crease around the 60th over, he\u2019d have needed to bat at No17. 61st over: England 189-2 (Burns 92, Denly 18) The Aussies have convinced the umpires to change the ball in the hope the replacement will swing. And it does, instantly, for Pattinson. Although Denly drives impressively through mid-off for four, that was a very encouraging over for Australia. 60th over: England 185-2 (Burns 92, Denly 14) Burns lunges at Cummins, his feet skittering around with the same elegance and purpose you\u2019ll see on high streets up and down the land at 11.30 tonight, and is beaten. But he moves into the nineties - the nineties, against Australia - with a nice push drive through extra cover for four. That drum-and-bass track you can hear is Rory Burns\u2019 heartbeat. \u201cStarc\u2019s red ball form has declined since the middle of that series vs. South Africa,\u201d says Marie Meyer. \u201cCan\u2019t think why...\u201d 59th over: England 179-2 (Burns 86, Denly 14) \u201cYou brought a huge smile to my face with those Brendon McCullum stats,\u201d says Ryan Price. \u201cI used to spend hours on this site going through iconic players stats and making them as favourable or as bad as I could whether I liked them or not to justify my bias\u2026\u201d Statsguru is great. You can prove anything, even that Bradman was rubbish. That said, those McCullum stats cover his career after the death of Phillip Hughes, which had a profound impact on the way he played. 58th over: England 178-2 (Burns 85, Denly 14) Burns drags Cummins into the leg side for a single, which makes this his highest Test score. For all the imperfections and idiosyncrasies, he has shown admirable mental strength. He went into this match with everybody assuming he would be the next cab back on the rank. Denly is beaten on the inside by a good delivery from Cummins. This is his fourth spell and his pace is down to around 82-84mph, but he is still bowling some jaffas. \u201cI just saw a sideboard at Edgbaston with \u2018Simplicity Cremations\u2019 on it,\u201d says Matt Bell. \u201cHave you noticed? That\u2019s dark even if a pun on The Ashes. I looked them up to see if they were real and, it turns out, there are local branches. They didn\u2019t have very good reviews and I thought, \u2018How do you screw up that business?\u2019\u201d There are ways. You don\u2019t wanna know about it, believe me. 57th over: England 177-2 (Burns 84, Denly 14) Lyon starts after tea to Burns, who should be refreshed after a break and a nice cool glass of pleasemothercricketletmegetanother18runs. He works a couple of singles off Lyon, equalling his highest Test score in the process, before Denly thwacks a boundary through the covers. There are no guarantees - not in this world, not with this England team - but this is a great opportunity to put Australia away. I doubt conditions will be friendlier for batting throughout the series. \u201cAfternoon, Rob,\u201d says the OBO\u2019s resident bohemian, Phil Sawyer. \u201cHave to agree on the inclusion of Pattinson and Siddle. Both have had lethal spells in the county championship; Pattinson took a bucket full of wickets for me in the fantasy cricket during his first spell with Notts. Also, if the Aussies had left either of them out and been looking at the same scoreline right now, you\u2019d be being bombarded by emails from county cricket followers decrying the decision. So at least you\u2019ve been saved that. PS. It\u2019s Friday night in Penang and I\u2019m in my hotel room drinking a warm beer and listening to TMS. I know.\u201d This is a hard game to appraise. We\u2019ve already had two Tests in one: 122 for eight in helpful bowling conditions until around 3pm yesterday, 332 for four on a flat deck since. Australia will hope there is a third Test to come, in which the ball turns square and Nathan Lyon wins the match. I\u2019ll be back in 15 minutes for the extended evening session. In the meantime, why not say hello to the man who invented liveblogs, Scott Murray? Yeah, nice one, Scotty. Thanks, pal. 56th over: England 170-2 (Burns 82, Denly 9) Gorgeous batting from Denly, who drives Siddle classically between extra cover and mid-off for four. That\u2019s the shot of the day so far. His defence has been less assured so far, however, and he survives an LBW appeal off the final ball of the session when Siddle gets one to nip back from outside off stump. It was going over the top. That\u2019s tea. 55th over: England 164-2 (Burns 82, Denly 3) Burns cuts Lyon for another single, which takes him to within two of his highest Test score and 18 of you-know-what. Denly has a couple of hairy moments later in the over, bat-padding short of silly point and flicking wide of short leg. \u201cI agree with Pete,\u201d says Graham O\u2019Reilly. \u201cCummins ahead of Starc seems very weird. There\u2019s not enough variety or aggression.\u201d That\u2019s interesting. Cummins would be my first choice, although he has looked slightly flat in the last few months. 54th over: England 162-2 (Burns 81, Denly 2) Burns, trying to leave Siddle at the last minute, unwittingly deflects the ball just wide of off stump. A single takes him to 81 before Denly is beaten by a beautiful outswinger, delivered from wide on the crease. Lovely bowling. \u201cSiddle going for 1.7 rpo, keeping a lid on it,\u201d says Jack Jorgensen. \u201cNo problem with the selection, has Root\u2019s wicket. Pattinson and Cummins going above 3, and Siddle provides control. Lyon can also attack from the other end with Siddle bowling.\u201d It\u2019s a good debate. All five seamers are superb, so I think you could pick any three. (I\u2019m sure Michael Neser is good, too, I just haven\u2019t seen much of him.) Generally, in these conditions, I\u2019d have Cummins plus Starc or Pattinson and Hazlewood or Siddle. That said, I do have lascivious daydreams about watching Starc, Pattinson, Cummins and Hazlewood on a Perth trampoline. 53rd over: England 161-2 (Burns 80, Denly 2) \u201cI\u2019ve been playing a fair bit of Cricket 19 recently,\u201d writes Max Cornell. \u201cI\u2019m not very good at it so I just play it on easy, but it\u2019s given me the false belief that batsmen should be swinging at absolutely everything and that an over with fewer than three boundaries is, quite simply, a failure. That probably also explains why my player has a strike rate of 300+ but an average of about 30.\u201d Is he called B McCullum? Jeez, I love that man. For the last 15 months of his Test career, he turned into Biggles. 52nd over: England 160-2 (Burns 79, Denly 2) Joe Denly, making his Ashes debut at 33, gets off the mark by flicking Siddle through square leg for a couple. That\u2019s your lot, although there were another couple of confident strokes for no run. \u201cI do think you should let up on Burns,\u201d says Romeo. \u201cHe\u2019s doing what no England opener for ages has been able to do: stick in there and grind it out, making ugly runs while riding his luck. (I wrote this before Sanga said much the same thing on commentary.) And please put up this link for poor Ravikiran.\u201d 51st over: England 158-2 (Burns 79, Denly 0) Lyon beats Burns with a ripper that turns and bounces - but when he drops short later in the over, Burns slams it emphatically through the covers for four. This is a vital little spell before tea; Australia will fancy their chances of picking up one or even two more in the next 20 minutes. 50th over: England 154-2 (Burns 75, Denly 0) That\u2019s the first time in the last 22 innings that Root has been dismissed between 50 and 100. His problem, in recent times, has been getting to fifty rather than converting. Brilliant! Peter Siddle has dismissed Joe Root with a superb reaction catch off his bowling. Root played a lofted drive back towards Siddle, who thrust out his right hand to grab the ball in his follow through. 49th over: England 153-1 (Burns 75, Root 57) Nathan Lyon, Australia\u2019s likeliest matchwinner, returns to the attack. He beats Burns with a beautiful off-break that just misses the off stump and bursts through Paine for a bye. England will want a big first-innings lead as Lyon insurance, as he\u2019ll be a handful in the fourth innings. \u201cWanting to get in first with this, but leaving out Starc and Hazlewood, wtf?\u201d says Pete Salmon. \u201cThis has been sold as a terrific paradigm shift by Australia, but it seemed nuts at the toss, and even more nuts now. And do I remember rightly how cross they both were after Warner fingered them for sandpaper-gate? Kicked out of their WhatApp group etc. Will this be one of those things where when Aus lose the series 3-0 we find out how ugly it was in the dressing room? When it\u2019s no longer useful for us to know?\u201d I can see the logic, personally. Starc\u2019s red-ball form has been mixed, Hazlewood is coming back from injury (and didn\u2019t bowl that well in 2015), and Pattinson and Siddle have form in English conditions. There\u2019s also rotation to consider. I think they\u2019ve been a bit unfortunate, too - had Siddle bowled in yesterday\u2019s conditions, for example, he could have run riot. 48th over: England 152-1 (Burns 75, Root 57) Root tucks Cummins to the fine-leg boundary to reach an important, controlled half-century from 110 balls. The Edgbaston crowd respond by booing Steve Smith, which is disappointing. He limps away in pain after inside-edging the next ball onto his knee. There was an LBW appeal too, as it was pad first, but it hit him well outside the line of off stump. An eventful over continues when Burns survives a run-out chance. He had given up and was well short of his ground when Khawaja\u2019s throw from backward point missed the stumps. That was a strange incident, in that it was a dreadful call and also a peculiarly tame throw from Khawaja. 47th over: England 144-1 (Burns 75, Root 49) Root thick edges Pattinson between second slip and gully for four. On reflection, he may have meant to steer it into the gap. He certainly softened his hands to ensure it would go along the floor This is hard yakka for the Australian fast bowlers on a slow pitch, but Cummins and Pattinson are going about it with almost masochistic relish. It\u2019s so good to see Pattinson playing Test cricket again. It\u2019ll be even better to see him on a flyer. \u201cWhile we are thinking of Root\u2019s records,\u201d begins John Starbuck, \u201chow does he feature in the list (there must be one) of batsmen with innings containing the most DRS-overturned out decisions?\u201d Statsguru doesn\u2019t offer that information yet. 46th over: England 137-1 (Burns 74, Root 44) Thanks Geoff, hello everyone. Cummins produces a very good ball that follows Root, takes the glove and flies between second and fourth slip for three runs. Burns is then beaten twice outside off stump. Australia have had no luck at all today. 45th over: England 134-1 (Burns 74, Root 41) Pattinson to Root, that pace and lift has Root hopping and dropping the ball away towards point. Bright sunshine has swept over the ground after a cloudy start to the day. Pattinson nearly sneaks through onto Burns\u2019 pad, but the bat just gets down. Then Burns flirts with the line outside off stump but withdraws. And it\u2019s time for me to withdraw. Thanks for your company, it\u2019s been a great time. I\u2019m back on Day 4. I\u2019ll leave you with a man who always has the TMS link, Rob Smyth. 44th over: England 133-1 (Burns 74, Root 40) Another streak from Burns, who swings at Cummins and edges four through the cordon again. Good grief. Finally he gets one out of the middle, driving straight and teasing Wade all the way into the fence. \u201cI believe Joe Root just surpassed Graham Thorpe on the all-time list. Ken Barrington is 59 runs away.\u201d Thanks, Michael Meagher, from a couple of overs ago. It\u2019s now Root 6757, Barrington 6806. 43rd over: England 124-1 (Burns 66, Root 39) Pattinson. Three slips, gully, point. Wastes a ball down the leg side. Moves the line across. Burns is thinking about it, watching, finally shuffling across to nudge a run through a midwicket misfield. Root takes a single before drinks. 42nd over: England 122-1 (Burns 65, Root 38) Cummins is indeed back at the other end, Australia champing for a wicket. Not this time! Root square drives four! Paine shifts his field, moving Lyon from point to more of a deep second gully, with Khawaja at a regulation gully and two slips. Ravikiran Ramakrishnan writes in, disconsolate. \u201cWhy is Joe Root sporting the number 66? Everywhere I read about it it seems obvious to everyone why, but i can\u2019t figure it out. It\u2019s genuinely distressing.\u201d Ravi, this is adorable, but it\u2019s also so funny that I\u2019m not going to tell you. 41st over: England 118-1 (Burns 65, Root 34) Pattinson is back, and he slips full to Root, who is up and purring now. Lovely shot through midwicket for four. Knocks away a single, and then it\u2019s Burns doing Burns things. A skewed outside edge after being squared up, no control whatsoever, and two runs through gully. Then a proper outside edge pushing outside the line, and four! \u201cOk, Mr Burns, where were you trying to hit the ball?\u201d \u201cI... don\u2019t know.\u201d 40th over: England 107-1 (Burns 59, Root 29) Ohhhh, Good Lord! How is Rory Burns not out by now? He\u2019s been out about 16 times. He\u2019s played every bad shot in the book. But someone somewhere has left a cigarette for an obscure god at the right roadside shrine. Burns throws the bat at a wider ball from Siddle, gets a thick outside edge, and it flies between slip and gully for four. 39th over: England 103-1 (Burns 55, Root 29) The hundred comes up for England (and I don\u2019t mean that in the ECB sense). Lyon strays onto leg stump and Root is quick to glance it away for four, very fine. Good control. Follows it up with a straight drive past the bowler, and Siddle has to chase back to save two. Steve Smith set the standard in 2017-18 and Root wasn\u2019t able to match it. England\u2019s main man looks like he\u2019s starting to take control today. 38th over: England 97-1 (Burns 55, Root 23) Four slips and point for Burns. Cover is open. Warner at mid-off. Cummins wide at mid-on. No midwicket. Deep square and long leg for the short ball. Acres ahoy in front of the wicket in either side, then. Siddle around the wicket to the left-hander, right arm and angling in and seaming away. Lovely bowling. Burns leaving. Four maidens for Siddle, 18 runs from 11 overs. 37th over: England 97-1 (Burns 55, Root 23) That bottom-handed whip across the line from Root can\u2019t beat the field this time against Lyon, so he tries a gentler version and gets a single. Burns gets a stride in and defends. With his head bobbing about like that, he plays a forward defence like he\u2019s trying to watch a movie on a plane over the seat of the person in front. Dan Johnson has a lovely take on recent events. \u201cThe thing about that typo was the fact that the score was so perfectly placed in the sweet spot of England collapses. I left the room for 20 minutes and came back to discover 71-7, but my brain accepted it without question. It was a few seconds later, scanning down the page to review the carnage, that I discovered it didn\u2019t actually happen (yet) and felt that euphoric relief, equivalent to 6 successful DRS reviews at once.\u201d 36th over: England 94-1 (Burns 53, Root 22) One of the slips has come out for Root against Siddle. We\u2019re down to three. Then a point and a cover. It\u2019s not like Root is hitting out though. He stays at home for another maiden over. Time for Cummins or Pattinson to earn their keep? 35th over: England 94-1 (Burns 53, Root 22) Using his feet against Lyon is Joe Root. Good positive stuff. Probably not going to rebound a six off the fourth tier of the grandstand a la Jason Roy, but he can defend from down the pitch and also flick a boundary through midwicket. 34th over: England 89-1 (Burns 53, Root 17) Siddle seams the ball, strikes Root on the pad, but the wicket is overturned! Umpire Dar says out, Root reviews, and there\u2019s a nick from the inside edge before the ball hit him plush in front of middle. The umpires are having a torrid time, Siddle has his joy taken away, the Hollies has its say. Booming cheers follow as Root drives a couple of runs behind point. Australia can\u2019t find that breakthrough. 33rd over: England 84-1 (Burns 53, Root 12) A nice shot there against Lyon, with the ball straightening down the stumps but a bit short, so Burns hangs back and turns it away off his hip for four. He\u2019s done exactly what his team needed from a player battling with form: he\u2019s just found a way to stick around, and the runs have come as a by-product. A brave day\u2019s work. 32nd over: England 80-1 (Burns 49, Root 12) Siddle probes away, and the batsmen only take a couple of singles, leaving and watching and blocking. 31st over: England 78-1 (Burns 48, Root 11) For a moment you think to yourself, maybe Burns has figured out this off-spin lark, as he skips back to carve a cut shot for four as Lyon drops short. Then Lyon beats him on the inside edge and only a nick saves him from being out leg before wicket. 30th over: England 74-1 (Burns 44, Root 11) And we\u2019re back after lunch. I managed to find a chunk of honeycomb the size of my first, so I\u2019m sorted. Siddle begins and finds the outside edge of Burns, but it runs along the ground and goes for three. Hot tip: if you ever want to detonate your inbox, typo the score at the lunch break of an Ashes Test. Several readers are recovering in hospital as we speak. Mea culpa. And Vic Marks wrote the match report, in his usual lovely way. I took a perilous journey into the heart of the Hollies to meet some fellow travellers. Ali Martin also wrote a nice bit on Good Old Woakesy. I\u2019m going to hunt down a sandwich. In the meantime, read Barney Ronay why not? There we are. England\u2019s session, in that they\u2019ve worn through Australia\u2019s bowlers and lost only one wicket for their trouble. But not a dominant session because it was so low-scoring. Only 61 runs added in 27 overs, so if Australia get a couple of wickets they\u2019ll be right back on top. England\u2019s batsmen have to press home the advantage as the bowlers tire. 29th over: England 71-1 (Burns 41, Root 11) Cummins with the finale, but Burns gets off strike and Root sees out the final four balls, ducking a high bouncer and blocking on off stump. It\u2019s lunch! They survive. 28th over: England 70-1 (Burns 40, Root 11) Lyon races through a maiden over so that Cummins can bowl one more before lunch. Root blocks, except the ball where he plays a massive sweep shot and misses completely, surviving the appeal because he was hit outside the line of off stump. \u201cThank you, Geoff,\u201d writes William Hargreaves. \u201cI\u2019m in a place where I can\u2019t listen to what you can listen to, but I can listen to what you can\u2019t, so just to confirm, I can hear it. Who\u2019s on first base?\u201d 27th over: England 70-1 (Burns 40, Root 11) Is this the day that Rory Burns comes good? He\u2019s very comfortable against Cummins, who usually tests most batsmen. Burns plays a luscious on-drive for four as lunchtime nears. \u201cNow that replays can prove absolutely everything, how is it that removing the bails is still the only proof of being bowled?\u201d writes Graham O\u2019Reilly. \u201cIt\u2019s an analogue solution in a digital age.\u201d I tend to agree, after all those non-bowled episodes in the World Cup. Time to reword the Laws. You give an lbw based on whether the ball would have hit the stumps, not whether it would have hit them hard enough to knock the bails off. If the stumps are hit then the bowler has won and the batsman hasn\u2019t protected his wicket. 26th over: England 66-1 (Burns 36, Root 11) Lyon to Root, a maiden technically. A couple of byes are scored as Paine misses a ball down leg. 25th over: England 64-1 (Burns 36, Root 11) Cummins returns exactly the way he started, serving up a half volley on the pads for Burns to clip for four. Start as you mean to go on doesn\u2019t apply here. Richard Harman has sent me the TMS link for today. Right, so this will be the daily strategy going forward. People overseas will email me asking for a link that they can listen to but I can\u2019t. I will post the wrong one because I can\u2019t hear it. Richard Harman will see the post and send me the link. I will post it without being able to check it, and you will all be able to hear it as long as you\u2019re not where most of our readers are. It\u2019s the most efficient way. Updates, updates! From Ali Martin. Who is sitting five seats down and frankly could have just told me this rather than going the circuitous route of writing an article and posting it on the website that we both work for. Passive-aggressive housemate politics at their finest. 24th over: England 59-1 (Burns 32, Root 10) Burns is doing alright against Lyon now, leaving a couple and defending, before bunting a brace through midwicket. I\u2019ll especially send a greeting to Georgie Clay, who was far more polite than me when seeking out the TMS link. Is this it, or is it yesterday\u2019s? I can\u2019t listen to it because I\u2019m in the UK. 23rd over: England 57-1 (Burns 30, Root 10) Pattinson keeps wearing away at Root as we trend towards lunch. Root watches everything keenly and remains circumspect, after Burns picked up a couple of leg byes and then a single. We\u2019ve had a lot of people emailing this morning to ask for the TMS link for overseas listeners. This is a phenomenon that its quite fascinating: when people clearly have internet access given they\u2019re using it to communicate, but their choice of communication is to ask other people to send them things that are also on the internet. Maybe I just don\u2019t understand British politness. So I won\u2019t just post the link to Let Me Google That For You. 22nd over: England 53-1 (Burns 29, Root 9) Siddle sends down another maiden to Burns, who has done his job here this morning and found a way through some tough bowling. Alex Smith makes the distressing observation that nobody as yet has suggested Travis Headphones. I\u2019m not angry but I\u2019m disappointed. 21st over: England 53-1 (Burns 29, Root 9) Last ball of the over, Joe Root survives. We saw this a lot in the World Cup, but it\u2019s continued here with what I think are regulation wooden bails. Pattinson bowls an absolute peach. Some movement in towards Root\u2019s pads, some seam away after pitch. Beats the groping outside edge, nearly clips the pad, then hits the outside of the stump. But the bails don\u2019t fall. The umpire thinks it\u2019s a nick, and fair enough, and gives Root out. The DRS review confirms that the off stump was hit right on the outside at the top, and moved substantially inward, then back again. The angle of movement meant that the bail spigot just slid along the groove. Pattinson can\u2019t believe it, and inspects the bails for foul play. What can you say? 20th over: England 51-1 (Burns 29, Root 7) Burns brings up the first score milestone for England by opening the face and steering a full ball from Siddle square of third man. Burns knelt towards that ball as though offering it his sword. Wrap it up folks, Mac Millings has won the game. \u201cWhat with all this talk of electronic earwear, please allow me to present my all-time Headphones XI, or, as I like to call them, Bangladesh &amp; Olufsen.\u201d Alastairpods Cook Hitachi MacLaren Sir Donald Walkman Greg ChApple Kevin Beatsersen JVC de Villiers Hardik Skullcandya Rishabh Pantasonic Andy Flower &amp; Wilkins Samsung Curran MS Sony Fine work, Mc. Though there\u2019s plenty of Bang and not much Bowlufsen. 19th over: England 49-1 (Burns 27, Root 7) Pattinson is back, and he looks dangerous immediately. He\u2019s switched to the City End. Threatens the outside edge, seams the ball. The batsmen each get a single but nothing looks comfortable. 18th over: England 47-1 (Burns 26, Root 6) Both batsman very happy to be watchful against Siddle. They don\u2019t want to see that smile light up the cloudy Edgbaston noon. Why do they hate joy? A single from Root to backward point is all from the over. Jonathan Oliver, who I assume is not the one who had that television program as he\u2019s probably busy, writes in. \u201cAm I stretching things too much to post the following scenario: England vs India 1974. Chris Old bowls to Mr Gavaskar who edges one but stays at the crease. Old, infuriated, bellows at him: \u201cSunny, walk man!\u201d 17th over: England 46-1 (Burns 26, Root 5) The Rory Burns Firewalk against Nathan Lyon continues, this time nicking a ball away to the fence. I\u2019m trying to remember the last time I\u2019ve seen a top order player look this bad against a bowler and survive for so long. It\u2019s perversely impressive. 16th over: England 42-1 (Burns 22, Root 5) Another maiden for Siddle, this time to Root. Good to see some more headphone enthusiasts popping into the correspondence. \u201cWould you buy your speakers from Richer Sounds Richardson?\u201d asks Boris Starling. \u201cIf I recall correctly Richie does know his music: he and Curtly Ambrose were once in a band called Big Bad Dread and the Bald Head.\u201d Having commentated on TMS alongside him this summer I can confirm that Curtly Ambrose is so large as to terrify neighbours into near silence. He\u2019s very nice though. \u201cAssume we should be doing Beats By DRS?\u201d asks Paul Griffin, who is especially apt given the state of the umpiring in this match. 15th over: England 42-1 (Burns 22, Root 5) Burns should be gone! But he\u2019s still there. Lyon around the wicket, straightens it down the line, and struck in front. Joel Wilson says no and the Australians don\u2019t review it. But the technology says it would have been gone. Burns celebrates by nearly getting bowled next ball. I haven\u2019t seen Burns bat live before, and... I knew in theory that his technique was weird, but it really is a chiropractor\u2019s wet dream. What\u2019s your head doing all the way over there, mate? Is it popping into the Hollies to jump in line at the bar? 14th over: England 38-1 (Burns 19, Root 4) A bit more comfortable against pace for Burns, driving Siddle hard on the bounce back past the bowler for three, with Wade doing some serious miles to stop the boundary. Last ball before drinks, Siddle goes up for a Siddle special appeal against Root, arms wide and backpedalling, but the ball had struck too high on the pad. 13th over: England 35-1 (Burns 16, Root 4) Nathan Lyon comes on early in the day. Burns can be a duck in a shooting gallery against off-spin at times. Root is facing first though, and he\u2019s nearly bowled! Absolute beauty from Lyon, it pitches miles outside off, but turns in like Murali! Misses the off stump by an inch perhaps. Travis Head though messes up by allowing Root off strike with a fumble next ball. Though that brings Burns on strike, and his most memorable shot for the over involves charging down the wicket and then doing the splits in a desperate attempt to reach a ball that dips on him, and managing to squeeze it away so he\u2019s not stumped. 12th over: England 33-1 (Burns 15, Root 3) Here we go. Peter Siddle, the beaming assassin. On to bowl to Burns and to produce the most Siddle over imaginable. Around the wicket to the lefty, angling in at him, and Siddle is bang on. Makes him play at every ball. Right on the off stump. Drawing a thick outside edge for two lucky runs, then a thin inside edge that saves Burns from leg before. 11th over: England 31-1 (Burns 13, Root 3) Now Cummins gets into the groove! Lovely ball outside off stump that draws Burns into a shot and then beats the edge by a micron. Then Burns is hit! Ducking, the bouncer doesn\u2019t get up, and as he leans forward to get under it, the ball skims the back of his helmet and bounces up over Paine behind the stumps. Four leg byes, no damage to Burns, and that\u2019s exactly the kind of blow that some readers are advocating Jimmy Anderson to seek out. On a more serious note, various people have been emailing on a theme like Nicholas Clark. \u201cThe difference with concussion is the risk to long term health. If somebody has concussion then another head injury can be extremely risky as the brain is already damaged. It\u2019s like hitting a bruise, it hurts more and causes more damage to the brain so they need taking out of the game entirely. Having a concussion substitute means a team is less likely to risk carrying on with a player at higher risk of long term brain damage. Aggravating a muscle injury isn\u2019t as severe and the player can often carry on in some way (eg Anderson is likely to be able to bat).\u201d Which is all true, it\u2019s just less funny. 10th over: England 26-1 (Burns 12, Root 3) James Pattinson has been run through the hot wash, given a fresh coat of wax, and he\u2019s absolutely gleaming. He zooms one past Root\u2019s outside edge again. Then draws a skewed shot through midwicket that picks up two lucky runs for Root. Then a mistimed defence that nearly pops back a catch to the bowler. Root taps away a single and runs for it. This is some spell. 9th over: England 22-1 (Burns 12, Root 0) Burns blocks out another maiden from Cummins. His morning is going ok. He\u2019s still there. 8th over: England 22-1 (Burns 12, Root 0) The sound around the ground is quite similar when Joe Root comes out to bat as it is for Steve Smith. Crowds are strange things. Pattinson is getting into his work now. Has a word to Root after beating the edge. Gets an ovation from the Australian fans as he goes back to field on the rope. Apologies for the slow updates at times, the website is lagging pretty hard. Must be the millions of readers loading the page. Welcome back to Test cricket, James Pattinson! It was starting to look like a matter of time against Roy, and the third is the charm. Back of a length, angled in at the batsman but perhaps moving a touch off the surface. Roy tries to defend with his weight back, and gets struck towards the shoulder of the bat from where it carries low to Smith. 7th over: England 22-0 (Burns 12, Roy 10) Cummins is not at his best today, and gives Burns another freebie on his pads that Burns duly cashes. 6th over: England 18-0 (Burns 8, Roy 10) This is fine stuff from Pattinson. Moves the ball enough to take Roy\u2019s edge but it bounces on its way to Smith at slip. Then the other way, past the inside edge and leaving a juicy Dukes bruise on Roy\u2019s thigh. He survives with wicket intact, a maiden over. William Matthewman continues on the headphone theme: \u201cI assume Skull Candy will be the name of the opening batsmen for the Kolkata Knight riders in 50 years\u2019 time when T20 players are rock stars enough to have stage names.\u201d William, that\u2019s almost Kerry O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s nickname from the 70s. Way ahead of that curve. 5th over: England 18-0 (Burns 8, Roy 10) There was only room for one Burns in this Ashes Test, and it was Rory. Lovely shot from the Surrey skipper as Cummins errs with a full wide ball, allowing a square drive behind point. Classy, on the grassy, rolled like it was on glassy. Burns banks his good fortune first ball and sees off the rest of the over. \u201cWith the new concussion rules coming in allowing a like for like replacement, why not send Jimmy in to bat with the specific instructions of getting hit in the head? That way we can swap Jofra in for the second innings.\u201d Cunning. If anyone can see any flaws in Tom Briggs\u2019 master plan, please fill them out in triplicate and staple them to Tom. 4th over: England 14-0 (Burns 4, Roy 10) Swing, swing, edge! Four! Pattinson into the attack, and bowling very attractive outswingers at pace right away. Jason Roy flings his hands at one and his lucky number comes up, into the gap in the slip cordon before the gully. Pattinson beats him with another, then nails a yorker. The switch is flipped to \u2018on\u2019. 3rd over: England 10-0 (Burns 4, Roy 6) And we\u2019re away. First of the day, third of the match. An uneventful first over after all the build-up, as the England fans sing Jerusalem and Rory Burns blocks out Pat Cummins around off stump. Uneventful will be a delight to Rory Burns. \u201cYour comment re concussion injury substitutes is spot on. Considering Test cricket has the longest playing time of any professional sport (probably!) surely at least one substitute should be allowed? If one tactical change could be made when would you use it?\u201d It\u2019s an interesting one, Neil Bowen. There are lots of reasons why it doesn\u2019t happen, which I\u2019m sure readers can number off. The Supersub (remember that) failed in one-day cricket because it could be made useless depending whether teams batted second or first. Maybe if there was a bench to choose from. But the ramifications for the structure of the game could be immense. Steve Hudson is taking care of the pessimist side. \u201cI saw Roy bat at Lord\u2019s when he made 50 and I really don\u2019t think he has the game when the ball is moving and there isn\u2019t much pace in the pitch. (I think we might lose a few early on too.)\u201d \u201cNot sure about heaphones,\u201d writes Richard Williams, \u201cbut I\u2019m pretty sure Bang &amp; Olufson were a great dual pace/spin attack in the 50s and 60s. Bowers &amp; Wilkins probably the opening batsmen that handled them the best.\u201d I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any blame anywhere. He thought he was fit; he could almost have played against Ireland. He went through his paces like any other time. You just don\u2019t know if injuries are going to happen, and sometimes they do. Every team has these moments. It does raise the question of why you can now have substitutes for concussions when you can\u2019t for any other kind of injury. Hooley cheeses, I just noticed that the main pure for the blog had updated. That Ben Stokes mask montage is a truly haunted image. Someone please do an exorcism on whichever editor chose that. \u201cI may have forgotten to charge my wireless earphones overnight so I\u2019m relying on you to keep me updated,\u201d writes Max Cornell. \u201cI just hope England are still batting at the end of the day.\u201d Surely the only cricket writer who could replace headphones would be... Mihir Bose? England\u2019s players are gathering out in the middle now, kicking the football around lackadaisically. Ben Stokes finishes his throwdowns and wanders over, his clean white socks pulled up nerd-high over his black compression tights. Now they\u2019re all lying down on their backs doing Bertie Beetle impressions, waving their legs in the air. \u201cOh, I\u2019ve been sprayed with insecticide, ohhhhh!\u201d That\u2019s how professionals do it. The Australians are all throwing down practice stumps and doing their best to look purposeful and stern and imposing. \u201cVirender Sehwag for all his qualities could never make a smooth transition to the ODI side,\u201d writes Amod Paranjape. \u201cHe was lethal in Tests but I think he thought he had to go even faster. Interesting to see what the reverse transition holds for Jason Roy.\u201d I\u2019m watching Jason Roy taking some throwdowns out in the middle at the moment. The sun has burst through and all looks joyful. A big day for Roy and Burns, the England openers have to offer something. I\u2019m not sure they will \u2013 my pointless prediction is that two or three cheap ones will fall, then there\u2019ll be runs from the middle order. It\u2019s a nice day for batting, and you\u2019d think England will need 350 at least with Lyon to bowl last on this surface. Moeen is having a trundle himself for now, and he\u2019s literally landing the ball on a tea towel. They\u2019ve spread out a small white cloth on a good length and he\u2019s trying to hit it. Joe Denly has actually landed a couple more than Mo. I don\u2019t really need to encourage this, because my email inbox is bracing itself for the Ashes deluge, but you can get in touch using geoff.lemon@theguardian.com or you can join me in the sunlit uplands of Twitter using @GeoffLemonSport. Good morning from Edgbaston. It\u2019s a pleasant sort of day so far here in Birmingham, some cloud about but some blue sky as well. And what a day of Ashes cricket we have for us. You know those Test days that end at just the right time? We\u2019re so evenly poised now. Some wins for England yesterday with Stuart Broad\u2019s five-for and the first eight wickets, then that extraordinary batting fightback from Steve Smith and Australia\u2019s two least likely, Peter Siddle and Nathan Lyon. Smith\u2019s hundred was one of the best the game has seen, given his personal circumstances mixed with those of the match, and Broad did what he has done against Australia so many times. Now we have one of those matches where we have no idea what is ahead. Australia, bowled out for 284. By day\u2019s end that could look like a very middling total if England bat well, or imposing if Australia\u2019s bowlers do the business. James Pattinson and Pat Cummins operating at pace, Siddle with smarts, Lyon to extract turn from a pitch that did spin yesterday. England with three of their top six yet to prove themselves at this level, and one or two of them hovering perilously near the drop. Everything is set up to be a brilliant day at the Ashes. Let\u2019s go.",

In between Rory Burns wafted and whooshed, hit a few, edged a few more and batted at times with all the graceful serenity of a man trying to force his way head-first through a privet hedge.</p> <p>At the end of which Burns finished a captivating day on 125 not out, his first hundred for England, and an innings that already seems likely to garland and indeed define his career as a cricketer.</p> <p>As the sun moved steadily across the sky, only one thing seemed to be happening at Edgbaston. Australia bowled to Burns. Burns waited, squinted, squatted suddenly as though fighting a bout of gastric nerves, and repelled the attack.</p> <p>He played horribly at times, did not care and played horribly some more. The ball passed his outside edge at least 30 times. It was urgent, scrappy, dogged and by the end an impossibly precious innings for England\u2019s hopes in this series.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/aug/02/joe-root-escape-bails-law-rethink-cricket-james-pattinson\">Joe Root\u2019s lucky escape was far from freakish \u2013 bails law needs a rethink | Geoff Lemon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There was also a nobility in Australia\u2019s persistence. Bowling all day to Rory Burns: this is both an activity and a statement of fact. Australia were unstinting. Pat Cummins bowled with wonderful heart. The fielding levels never dropped. It was gripping, in the way only this strange, absorbing sport can be. There was even something deeply true to himself about the way Burns brought up that first Test hundred from his 224th ball.

      "bodyText": "Happy Burns day. England\u2019s left-handed opener faced the first ball and the last ball on the second day of this first Ashes Test. In between Rory Burns wafted and whooshed, hit a few, edged a few more and batted at times with all the graceful serenity of a man trying to force his way head-first through a privet hedge. At the end of which Burns finished a captivating day on 125 not out, his first hundred for England, and an innings that already seems likely to garland and indeed define his career as a cricketer. As the sun moved steadily across the sky, only one thing seemed to be happening at Edgbaston. Australia bowled to Burns. Burns waited, squinted, squatted suddenly as though fighting a bout of gastric nerves, and repelled the attack. He played horribly at times, did not care and played horribly some more. The ball passed his outside edge at least 30 times. It was urgent, scrappy, dogged and by the end an impossibly precious innings for England\u2019s hopes in this series. There was also a nobility in Australia\u2019s persistence. Bowling all day to Rory Burns: this is both an activity and a statement of fact. Australia were unstinting. Pat Cummins bowled with wonderful heart. The fielding levels never dropped. It was gripping, in the way only this strange, absorbing sport can be. There was even something deeply true to himself about the way Burns brought up that first Test hundred from his 224th ball. Nathan Lyon bowled on middle stump. Burns nudge-plonked it into the leg side and sprinted to the other end, already removing his helmet and punching the air as Joel Wilson signalled for a review, the return having shaved the stumps. It has been a strange couple of days for the starchiest of all the formats. If a passing group of Martians, Venusians or Americans had chosen this first Test to conduct a case study into Test cricket their chief conclusions would be that the way to score runs is to flinch, twitch and shiver around the crease like a startled squirrel.

      "bodyText": "Four months ago, the woman in charge of recruiting Republicans to run for Congress in the 2020 elections lectured her party about diversity. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we, as a conference, do a better job of looking like America, and better representing the very diverse country that we have,\u201d said Susan Brooks, a four-term representative from Indiana. At the time, Brooks was one of only 13 women out of 197 Republicans serving in the House of Representatives. But that paltry number could shrink further when the next Congress is sworn in in 2021. Last week, a sitting Republican congresswoman from Alabama announced her departure. And last month, Brooks undermined her own call for diversity by announcing that she, too, had decided to quit Congress. \u201cWhile it may not be time for the party, it\u2019s time for me personally,\u201d Brooks said. As a party led almost exclusively by white men, represented in Congress overwhelmingly by white men and increasingly dependent on the votes of white men, Republicans have for years paid lip service to the need to \u201cbetter reflect the makeup of the United States\u201d.

The proportion of white men within the Democratic caucus subsequently dropped from 41% to 38%, while the same percentage rose among Republicans from 86% to 90%. African American voters remain overwhelmingly Democratic, according to Pew Research, with 84% identifying with or leaning toward the party and just 8% identifying in some way with the Republican party. Meanwhile, the share of women who identified with or leaned toward the Democratic Party rose from 54% in 2016 and 56% in 2017, while the partisan breakdown of men was relatively unchanged with a 51-47 Republican tilt.",

The club saw no other suitable option, especially after a previous target, Matthijs de Ligt, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/18/matthijs-de-ligt-joins-juventus-from-ajax-75m-deal\" title=\"\">left Ajax for Juventus</a>.</p> <p>If the agreement represents a negotiating victory for Leicester, it also leaves Brendan Rodgers with a big gap to fill in his squad before the season kicks off. He is likely to make a move for Brighton\u2019s Lewis Dunk.</p> <p>Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, meanwhile, will be satisfied that his defence has been substantially reinforced, with Maguire\u2019s probable arrival following the capture of the right-back Aaron Wan-Bissaka, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/29/manchester-united-complete-45m-signing-of-aaron-wan-bissaka\" title=\"\">joined from Crystal Palace for \u00a345m</a>.</p> <p>United hope their signings will not stop with Maguire. They remain keen on Paulo Dybala and have asked Juventus about the availability of another of their attacking players, Mario Mandzukic. Juventus say they will contemplate selling the Croatia striker only if a swap involving Dybala and Romelu Lukaku goes through. Both clubs want the swap to happen, and Lukaku is also happy with the arrangement, but they are waiting for Dybala to decide.</p> <p>United have work to do in that regard. Dybala will not consider joining unless he is among the club\u2019s top earners and is demanding higher wages than have been offered. His image rights, which are owned by an agency, and the money sought by his agents could also be stumbling blocks.</p> <p>United have made their defensive revamp a priority, however. They conceded more goals than any other team in the top half of the Premier League except for West Ham \u2013 and the toll would have been heavier still but for David de Gea, even if the goalkeeper had a substandard season.</p> <p>Maguire, too, was a little below his best last season. He went into that campaign on the back of an excellent World Cup with England and a splendid first season at Leicester, whom he joined from Hull City for what has proved a bargain \u00a312m fee (rising to \u00a317m).</p> <p>Although he was often superb last season, he also had uncharacteristic lapses and his sloppiness spilled over into his performances for England in the Nations League in June. That highlighted a truth that Maguire and United must address: although the 26-year-old is set to change clubs for a world-record fee, he is not yet a world-class player.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2019/jun/04/football-transfer-window-2019-every-summer-deal-from-europe-top-five-leagues\">Transfer window 2019 \u2013 every summer deal from Europe's top five leagues</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But he does have outstanding qualities and a proven ability to rise to fresh challenges, having played his way up from the lower leagues to become an England regular. Most of his appearances for his hometown club Sheffield United came in League One.</p> <p>His attitude is exemplary and nothing about his character suggests he will create strife in a United squad whose mentality has been questioned in recent seasons. Solskj\u00e6r has been at pains to ensure new arrivals bring positivity, not preciousness.</p> <p>Maguire\u2019s aerial power will also be a welcome addition to United\u2019s backline. It was one of the factors in Leicester conceding fewer goals from set pieces last season than any other team in the Premier League. He is also strong in the tackle and a smart reader of play. Although his primary duty at United will be to secure their defence, most likely alongside Victor Lindel\u00f6f, especially now that Eric Bailly faces four to five months out with a knee injury sustained during pre-season, he is also much better equipped than the club\u2019s other centre-backs to launch attacks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>He can play out well from the back, blessed with a decent range of passing, neat feet and a fondness for barnstorming runs forward.

It is up to Solskj\u00e6r to show the coaching skills needed to help him perform consistently to the level required, which, presumably, at least means qualifying this season for the Champions League, in which Maguire has never played.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Manchester United believe they need Harry Maguire so badly that they have agreed to pay Leicester City \u00a380m for the centre-back, who will become the world\u2019s most expensive defender if he passes a medical. The fee eclipses the \u00a375m that Liverpool forked out to Southampton for Virgil van Dijk in 2018 and United hope Maguire will make an impact similar to the one the Dutchman has had at Anfield. Manchester City were also keen on hiring Maguire but recoiled at the price. Leicester, who rejected lower bids from United earlier in the summer, refused to budge, leaving United with no choice but to hand over an unprecedented sum or shop elsewhere. The club saw no other suitable option, especially after a previous target, Matthijs de Ligt, left Ajax for Juventus. If the agreement represents a negotiating victory for Leicester, it also leaves Brendan Rodgers with a big gap to fill in his squad before the season kicks off. He is likely to make a move for Brighton\u2019s Lewis Dunk. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, meanwhile, will be satisfied that his defence has been substantially reinforced, with Maguire\u2019s probable arrival following the capture of the right-back Aaron Wan-Bissaka, who joined from Crystal Palace for \u00a345m. United hope their signings will not stop with Maguire. They remain keen on Paulo Dybala and have asked Juventus about the availability of another of their attacking players, Mario Mandzukic. Juventus say they will contemplate selling the Croatia striker only if a swap involving Dybala and Romelu Lukaku goes through. Both clubs want the swap to happen, and Lukaku is also happy with the arrangement, but they are waiting for Dybala to decide. United have work to do in that regard. Dybala will not consider joining unless he is among the club\u2019s top earners and is demanding higher wages than have been offered. His image rights, which are owned by an agency, and the money sought by his agents could also be stumbling blocks. United have made their defensive revamp a priority, however. They conceded more goals than any other team in the top half of the Premier League except for West Ham \u2013 and the toll would have been heavier still but for David de Gea, even if the goalkeeper had a substandard season. Maguire, too, was a little below his best last season. He went into that campaign on the back of an excellent World Cup with England and a splendid first season at Leicester, whom he joined from Hull City for what has proved a bargain \u00a312m fee (rising to \u00a317m). Although he was often superb last season, he also had uncharacteristic lapses and his sloppiness spilled over into his performances for England in the Nations League in June. That highlighted a truth that Maguire and United must address: although the 26-year-old is set to change clubs for a world-record fee, he is not yet a world-class player. But he does have outstanding qualities and a proven ability to rise to fresh challenges, having played his way up from the lower leagues to become an England regular. Most of his appearances for his hometown club Sheffield United came in League One. His attitude is exemplary and nothing about his character suggests he will create strife in a United squad whose mentality has been questioned in recent seasons. Solskj\u00e6r has been at pains to ensure new arrivals bring positivity, not preciousness. Maguire\u2019s aerial power will also be a welcome addition to United\u2019s backline. It was one of the factors in Leicester conceding fewer goals from set pieces last season than any other team in the Premier League. He is also strong in the tackle and a smart reader of play. Although his primary duty at United will be to secure their defence, most likely alongside Victor Lindel\u00f6f, especially now that Eric Bailly faces four to five months out with a knee injury sustained during pre-season, he is also much better equipped than the club\u2019s other centre-backs to launch attacks. He can play out well from the back, blessed with a decent range of passing, neat feet and a fondness for barnstorming runs forward. He will need to judge such surges well, however, because he does not have the speed to recover after giving ground to top forwards. Maguire is a very good player who could become invaluable to United with the right guidance. It is up to Solskj\u00e6r to show the coaching skills needed to help him perform consistently to the level required, which, presumably, at least means qualifying this season for the Champions League, in which Maguire has never played.",

      "bodyText": "A Swedish court has freed A$AP Rocky and two co-defendants until 14 August, when the verdicts in their trial for assault will be announced. The platinum-selling US rapper, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, and two members of his entourage have been in detention since 3 July in connection with a street brawl in central Stockholm on 30 June. The case has prompted outrage among Mayers\u2019 fans and inflamed international tensions after celebrities including Kim Kardashian West and Justin Bieber backed a #JusticeForRocky campaign and Donald Trump publicly demanded Mayers\u2019 release. There were cheers and applause in the courtroom when senior district court judge Per Lennerbrant announced the decision. \u201cWe\u2019re so happy,\u201d said Renee Black, Mayers\u2019 mother, who attended all three days of her son\u2019s trial in Stockholm district court. The US president was swift to react to the decision, tweeting: \u201cA$AP Rocky released from prison and on his way home to the United States from Sweden. It was a Rocky Week, get home ASAP A$AP!\u201d \u201cHe is a free person for now,\u201d Mayers\u2019 lawyer, Slobodan Jovicic, told reporters. But he cautioned: \u201cIt is a success that they are out, but that does not mean that they have been cleared. We now have a nervous wait for two more weeks.\u201d Releasing the defendants from custody could indicate the rapper will be found not guilty, or that a guilty verdict would lead only to a suspended term or a jail sentence shorter than the time the rapper has already spent in prison, legal experts have said. Earlier on Friday the public prosecutor, Daniel Suneson, demanded that Mayers serve six months in prison for assault causing actual bodily harm to the alleged victim, Mustafa Jafari, in the incident outside a hamburger restaurant. \u201cFor several reasons, I do not think that anything other than a prison sentence is appropriate in this case,\u201d the prosecutor said. However Jovicic told the court his client should be released, saying there was \u201cno basis to believe the description of the crime applies to my client \u2013 he should be acquitted and set free today.\u201d The prosecution alleged that after a violent altercation over a pair of headphones, Mayers, 30, threw Jafari, 19, to the ground, after which he and his two companions kicked and punched him and hit him on the body and head with a bottle. Two women who witnessed the brawl told the court on Friday they were in a restaurant when they recognised the platinum-selling rapper outside. They saw him push Jafari over and punch or kick him, they said, but could not confirm he had used a bottle as a weapon. Jafari is claiming SEK 139,700 (\u00a312,050) in damages for the alleged attack, which left him needing hospital treatment for cuts to his arms, legs and head and a fractured rib. Mayers and the two members of his entourage conceded hitting the plaintiff but denied using a bottle. All said they were responding to harassment and provocations and have pleaded not guilty to assault causing actual bodily harm. Mayers, whose first two albums went to No 1 in the US, told the court on Thursday he had been attacked several times in recent years and had been \u201cshocked and scared\u201d by the incident. He had asked Jafari to leave him and his crew alone, he said. Mayers\u2019s bodyguard testified that Jafari had been \u201charassing\u201d and \u201cfollowing\u201d the group and \u201cswung\u201d at him prior to the fight. The judge ruled a previous assault conviction against the plaintiff was admissible evidence. Much of the trial centred on the video evidence, some of which appeared on the celebrity news site TMZ and, in edited form, on Mayers\u2019 Instagram page, and the question of whether a bottle had been used. The case sparked a diplomatic spat after Kardashian West appealed directly to Trump, prompting the president to call the Swedish prime minister, Stefan L\u00f6fven, and offer to \u201cpersonally vouch for [Mayers\u2019] bail, or an alternative\u201d. L\u00f6fven said that in the Swedish judicial system, prosecutors and courts were independent, after which Trump tweeted that he was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d, adding: \u201cGive A$AP Rocky his FREEDOM. We do so much for Sweden but it doesn\u2019t seem to work the other way around. Sweden should focus on its real crime problem!\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Dr Galarrwuy Yunupingu parked his wheelchair directly in front of the federal Indigenous affairs minister \u2013 and issued a warning into his handheld microphone. His people had had enough of the Australian government\u2019s failure to recognise Indigenous people in the nation\u2019s constitution and, if they did not resolve it this time, he would throw the founding document into the Arafura Sea. Surrounded by hundreds of attendees at the opening ceremony of this year\u2019s Garma festival, Yunupingu, chair of the organising Yothu Yindi Foundation, spoke directly to Ken Wyatt, Australia\u2019s first Indigenous minister and now its first to hold Indigenous affairs. \u201cWe\u2019re speaking hard but hardly doing anything,\u201d Yunupingu said. \u201cEnough is enough for Yolngu people who live here, in Yirrkala and all over the place.\u201d He suggested if the constitution could not properly recognise his people, his people would no longer recognise the constitution. \u201cWe will dismiss a constitution [which does not] worry about us because we\u2019ll have thrown out Australia into the saltwater,\u201d he said. Wyatt, who had held private talks with Yunupingu earlier that morning, said he understood the enormity of what he had to do, and looked forward to their partnership. Wyatt inherited a troubled national debate on the 2017 proposal, which first called for an Indigenous voice to parliament enshrined in the constitution. Last year\u2019s Garma festival heard the then prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, reject it. His successor, Scott Morrison, has also ruled it out. Earlier on Friday Wyatt stressed he would be \u201cpragmatic\u201d in his search for what that voice would look like \u2013 if anything \u2013 before a question was put to the Australian people in a referendum. \u201cEvery constitutional referendum when the question has failed has been sent into permanent retirement,\u201d he told media. \u201cIt is too critical to fail.\u201d Wyatt would not say a voice was definitely on the table. \u201cWe have to be very considered and measured but we have to consider all the other options as well.\u201d Wyatt said he was doing the work of speaking to every parliamentarian, determining who was on side, who needed to know more, and who was against it.

If it\u2019s going to be considered, let\u2019s consider it.\u201d Garma festival runs from Friday to Monday, and sees more than 2,500 people arrive at the Gumatj clan\u2019s Gulkula site on the Gove peninsula. The opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, will speak on Saturday afternoon, and other politicians, academics, professionals and leaders will discuss multiple Indigenous issues. Recent years have been dominated by the push for constitutional recognition of Australia\u2019s First Nations, and specifically the Uluru Statement from the Heart and subsequent reconciliation council recommendations. In a speech to the festival, Labor senator Patrick Dodson said willpower was needed. \u201cThe PM went to Dubbo and saw two dead sheep on the road and met some farmers and set up a [drought] fund the next day in parliament,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can do these things if there\u2019s a will.

      "body": "<p>Being socially active in your 50s and 60s may help lower the risk of developing dementia in later life, a study has found.</p> <p>Researchers studied data that tracked more than 10,000 people from 1985 to 2013. The participants answered a questionnaire every five years about the frequency of their social contact with friends and relatives. They were also subject to cognitive testing, and electronic health records were searched for dementia diagnoses.</p> <p>The results \u2013 <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1002862\">published in the journal </a><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1002862\">Plos Medicine</a> \u2013 showed that seeing friends almost daily at age 60 was associated with a 12% lower likelihood of developing dementia in later life, compared with those who saw only one or two friends every few months. Seeing relatives, on the other hand, did not show the same beneficial association.</p> <p>The authors suggest that practising using the brain for memory and language during social contact can build so-called cognitive reserve.</p> <p>Tara Spires-Jones, a professor of neurodegeneration at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved in the work, explained: \u201cLearning new things builds connections between brain cells, and so does social contact. The biology underlying this study is that the people who are socially active keep their brains better connected. If you have a better connected network in your brain, it can resist pathology for longer.\u201d</p> <p>Clive Ballard, a professor of age-related disorders at the University of Exeter, who was also not involved in the work, said: \u201cThere are plenty of other studies that have found that social isolation is a risk factor. The strength of this work is the large population studied, and that the assessment of social contact was done so long before the cognitive assessment bit. It makes the direction of causality much stronger.\u201d</p> <p>The authors note that the data did not include detail on the quality of social contact, and that dementia cases may have been missed if participants did not present to their GP.</p> <p>There may also be overlapping factors at play: \u201cIt is known that depression is a significant risk factor, and our work has shown that hearing loss is [also] a significant risk factor. Both of those might lead to social isolation. It\u2019s likely to be a cluster of things which are not totally independent,\u201d said Ballard.</p> <p>Similar benefits were seen for those who saw friends when they were aged 50 and 70, although the association was not strong enough to be statistically significant.</p> <p>\u201cThis is due to the statistical uncertainty involved in the study,\u201d said Dr Andrew Sommerlad of University College London, the lead author of the paper, \u201cThere\u2019s no conceivable reason why it\u2019d be important at 60 and not other age points.\u201d</p> <p>The work contributes to growing evidence that social activities could protect people from dementia in the long run, in addition to treating hearing loss, maintaining a healthy lifestyle and moving more.</p> <p>Ballard said: \u201cWe now think that at least 35% of the risk for dementia is explainable by medical and lifestyle factors, which are potentially reversible. In the last 10 years there has been a slight reduction within each age band [of people] developing dementia because we\u2019re beginning to pay more attention to those prevention factors.\u201d</p> <p>Sommerlad said: \u201cThe results of this study add another potential route by which people can take steps within their life to improve their brain health and reduce their risk of dementia.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to be conscious that we\u2019re in a society in which social isolation and loneliness is becoming more common. We hope that at a community level and policy level work will be done to make it easier for older people to stay connected.\u201d</p> <h2>Case study: \u2018It\u2019s almost like a place of hope\u2019</h2> <p>One movement that helps people socialise in middle age and beyond is the Men\u2019s Sheds, which started in Australia in the late 1990s after its founders identified a lack of social and community opportunities for men. The sheds are primarily aimed at men over 50 but everyone is welcome.</p> <p>The Sunnyside Men\u2019s Shed, one of 500 in the UK, sits in a quiet courtyard in Tower Hamlets, east London.

      "bodyText": "Being socially active in your 50s and 60s may help lower the risk of developing dementia in later life, a study has found. Researchers studied data that tracked more than 10,000 people from 1985 to 2013. The participants answered a questionnaire every five years about the frequency of their social contact with friends and relatives. They were also subject to cognitive testing, and electronic health records were searched for dementia diagnoses. The results \u2013 published in the journal Plos Medicine \u2013 showed that seeing friends almost daily at age 60 was associated with a 12% lower likelihood of developing dementia in later life, compared with those who saw only one or two friends every few months. Seeing relatives, on the other hand, did not show the same beneficial association. The authors suggest that practising using the brain for memory and language during social contact can build so-called cognitive reserve. Tara Spires-Jones, a professor of neurodegeneration at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved in the work, explained: \u201cLearning new things builds connections between brain cells, and so does social contact. The biology underlying this study is that the people who are socially active keep their brains better connected. If you have a better connected network in your brain, it can resist pathology for longer.\u201d Clive Ballard, a professor of age-related disorders at the University of Exeter, who was also not involved in the work, said: \u201cThere are plenty of other studies that have found that social isolation is a risk factor. The strength of this work is the large population studied, and that the assessment of social contact was done so long before the cognitive assessment bit. It makes the direction of causality much stronger.\u201d The authors note that the data did not include detail on the quality of social contact, and that dementia cases may have been missed if participants did not present to their GP. There may also be overlapping factors at play: \u201cIt is known that depression is a significant risk factor, and our work has shown that hearing loss is [also] a significant risk factor. Both of those might lead to social isolation. It\u2019s likely to be a cluster of things which are not totally independent,\u201d said Ballard. Similar benefits were seen for those who saw friends when they were aged 50 and 70, although the association was not strong enough to be statistically significant. \u201cThis is due to the statistical uncertainty involved in the study,\u201d said Dr Andrew Sommerlad of University College London, the lead author of the paper, \u201cThere\u2019s no conceivable reason why it\u2019d be important at 60 and not other age points.\u201d The work contributes to growing evidence that social activities could protect people from dementia in the long run, in addition to treating hearing loss, maintaining a healthy lifestyle and moving more. Ballard said: \u201cWe now think that at least 35% of the risk for dementia is explainable by medical and lifestyle factors, which are potentially reversible. In the last 10 years there has been a slight reduction within each age band [of people] developing dementia because we\u2019re beginning to pay more attention to those prevention factors.\u201d Sommerlad said: \u201cThe results of this study add another potential route by which people can take steps within their life to improve their brain health and reduce their risk of dementia. \u201cWe need to be conscious that we\u2019re in a society in which social isolation and loneliness is becoming more common. We hope that at a community level and policy level work will be done to make it easier for older people to stay connected.\u201d Case study: \u2018It\u2019s almost like a place of hope\u2019 One movement that helps people socialise in middle age and beyond is the Men\u2019s Sheds, which started in Australia in the late 1990s after its founders identified a lack of social and community opportunities for men. The sheds are primarily aimed at men over 50 but everyone is welcome. The Sunnyside Men\u2019s Shed, one of 500 in the UK, sits in a quiet courtyard in Tower Hamlets, east London. Steve, 64, started coming to the shed after his wife died of cancer. \u201cI came here as a user from [mental health charity] Mind after some bereavement counselling after I stopped work,\u201d he said. \u201cI was quite depressed before my wife passed away, and when she finally died I went to a really dark place. I didn\u2019t do anything for weeks and weeks, I was on antidepressants, and the doctor suggested I started doing something to take my mind out of it.\u201d \u201cComing here was good because I had no association with the past. I\u2019d done a lot of antique restoration work, woodwork, contemporary stuff \u2026 because I\u2019ve got all that knowledge it\u2019s great to be able to share it. \u201cA lot of people have come here and they have been rewarded by coming here,\u201d he added. \u201cBecause they may have had to give up work, they may have lost their sense of worth and self-confidence \u2026 they come in and repair something, or make something from new. \u201cThey\u2019ve discovered a new skill, and that might trigger something new in their life.

By common consent, which included the batsman\u2019s own opinion, Rory Burns was not in great form before this Test match, yet there he was settling into his stiff-necked stance in his sixth hour at the crease, defying perspiring Australia bowlers on his way to his maiden Test century. A stunning achievement on a sun-kissed Friday afternoon.</p> <p>Burns, ever more composed during his first experience of Ashes cricket, just kept soldiering on while delivering the innings of his life. He clipped the ball neatly off his legs whenever the opportunity arose; he square-cut the off-spin of Nathan Lyon if the ball was dropped short; he shuffled into line against the straight ones and was none too bothered when beaten by the wider ones, which was quite frequently especially in the view of exasperated Australian onlookers. He also sliced, carved and edged a few, magically eluding whatever formation of slip cordon Tim Paine had stationed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/aug/02/joe-root-escape-bails-law-rethink-cricket-james-pattinson\">Joe Root\u2019s lucky escape was far from freakish \u2013 bails law needs a rethink | Geoff Lemon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was not an elegant innings but who cares? Elegance is unlikely to be a prime consideration for Burns \u2013 he may not consider it all \u2013 but his system worked wonderfully well. He grafted and scurried in the tradition of faithful left-handed English openers of the past, who were all worthy of admiration even if they did not have latecomers sprinting to the turnstiles: Geoff Pullar, John Edrich and, more recently, Alastair Cook.</p> <p>Burns knows that he has not reached their standards yet. But after an innings of such resolution and phlegm he will now have the chance to enhance his Test career throughout the rest of the summer. His place is secure for a while; and just wait until he hits form.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbf7dcff2ba84ee26cedd0bf15d3d670f6926a04\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbf7dcff2ba84ee26cedd0bf15d3d670f6926a04/455_185_3360_2017/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Siddle\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Australia\u2019s Peter Siddle celebrates the wicket of Joe Root, before the England captain successfully reviewed the lbw decision.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These were runs that mattered \u2013 against Australia in the opening Test of the series \u2013 and they were all the more impressive given his recent form; Burns had not passed fifty since the middle of May.</p> <p>It took a while for him to reach those coveted three figures. On 88, he struck a crisp cover drive against Pat Cummins, a stroke as fluent as any that he had played all day but that did not presage a sprint towards his maiden Test century. He did not score for another half an hour. Then there was the odd single and a timely leg glance to the boundary; a nudge to the left of mid-on against Lyon and he was there punching the air before being locked in a bear hug with Ben Stokes.</p> <p>The second day was a better one for batting; the sun was out, the pitch was a mellower brown yet there seemed to be enough movement to encourage the bowlers in the first hour. After an edged boundary Jason Roy pushed hard at a fine delivery from James Pattinson and the ball sped into the safe hands of Steve Smith at second slip.</p> <p>There were no free runs to be gleaned thereafter. Lyon was introduced early and found some turn. When Burns was on 21 the off-spinner declined to review an lbw appeal that had been rejected by Joel Wilson. The replays revealed that any review would have been successful. Perhaps Australia were not inclined to waste one on a batsman who had been so out of touch.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, England\u2019s latest No 3, Joe Root, was always watchful and sometimes tentative. When he was on nine there was a concerted appeal from Pattinson for a catch behind the wicket. Wilson\u2019s finger was raised, Root reviewed and we soon discovered that the ball had indeed touched wood, but it was the wood of the off-stump. Somehow the bail declined to move, which seems to happen ever more frequently.</p> <p>On 14, when facing Peter Siddle, Root sought another immediate review when confronted by Aleem Dar\u2019s finger, correctly confident that the ball had taken a firm inside edge.</p> <p>This was tough, taut fare as England mustered 61 runs in that first session.</p> <p>Runs came more freely after lunch when Root finally began to find the boundary with a series of deft glides and clips while Burns willed himself onward. They had added 136 when Siddle made the breakthrough. A firm\u2011footed drive from Root sped from the middle of the bat into bowler\u2019s slipway as he followed through. Siddle stuck out his right hand and there the ball came to rest. A pure batsman would have chided himself for not getting on top of the ball, a Botham would have been furious that he had not hit the ball harder and higher.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/02/how-englands-rory-burns-got-his-first-test-century-ashes\">Flinch, twitch, shiver: how England\u2019s Rory Burns got his first Test century | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now the innings faltered. On either side of tea Joe Denly played two delicious cover drives but he fell soon after a ball change \u2013 it seemed the replacement was more willing to swing. Denly wisely declined to review when struck on the pads by a full-length delivery from Pattinson.</p> <p>Jos Buttler struck one crisp cover drive before edging to Cameron Bancroft at third slip off Cummins.</p> <p>Stokes now became a trusty ally for Burns.

      "bodyText": "Here was a reminder of the old pro\u2019s mantra, with which it\u2019s hard to argue \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s not how but how many that matters\u201d. By common consent, which included the batsman\u2019s own opinion, Rory Burns was not in great form before this Test match, yet there he was settling into his stiff-necked stance in his sixth hour at the crease, defying perspiring Australia bowlers on his way to his maiden Test century. A stunning achievement on a sun-kissed Friday afternoon. Burns, ever more composed during his first experience of Ashes cricket, just kept soldiering on while delivering the innings of his life. He clipped the ball neatly off his legs whenever the opportunity arose; he square-cut the off-spin of Nathan Lyon if the ball was dropped short; he shuffled into line against the straight ones and was none too bothered when beaten by the wider ones, which was quite frequently especially in the view of exasperated Australian onlookers. He also sliced, carved and edged a few, magically eluding whatever formation of slip cordon Tim Paine had stationed. It was not an elegant innings but who cares? Elegance is unlikely to be a prime consideration for Burns \u2013 he may not consider it all \u2013 but his system worked wonderfully well. He grafted and scurried in the tradition of faithful left-handed English openers of the past, who were all worthy of admiration even if they did not have latecomers sprinting to the turnstiles: Geoff Pullar, John Edrich and, more recently, Alastair Cook. Burns knows that he has not reached their standards yet. But after an innings of such resolution and phlegm he will now have the chance to enhance his Test career throughout the rest of the summer. His place is secure for a while; and just wait until he hits form. These were runs that mattered \u2013 against Australia in the opening Test of the series \u2013 and they were all the more impressive given his recent form; Burns had not passed fifty since the middle of May. It took a while for him to reach those coveted three figures. On 88, he struck a crisp cover drive against Pat Cummins, a stroke as fluent as any that he had played all day but that did not presage a sprint towards his maiden Test century. He did not score for another half an hour. Then there was the odd single and a timely leg glance to the boundary; a nudge to the left of mid-on against Lyon and he was there punching the air before being locked in a bear hug with Ben Stokes. The second day was a better one for batting; the sun was out, the pitch was a mellower brown yet there seemed to be enough movement to encourage the bowlers in the first hour. After an edged boundary Jason Roy pushed hard at a fine delivery from James Pattinson and the ball sped into the safe hands of Steve Smith at second slip. There were no free runs to be gleaned thereafter. Lyon was introduced early and found some turn. When Burns was on 21 the off-spinner declined to review an lbw appeal that had been rejected by Joel Wilson. The replays revealed that any review would have been successful. Perhaps Australia were not inclined to waste one on a batsman who had been so out of touch. Meanwhile, England\u2019s latest No 3, Joe Root, was always watchful and sometimes tentative. When he was on nine there was a concerted appeal from Pattinson for a catch behind the wicket. Wilson\u2019s finger was raised, Root reviewed and we soon discovered that the ball had indeed touched wood, but it was the wood of the off-stump. Somehow the bail declined to move, which seems to happen ever more frequently. On 14, when facing Peter Siddle, Root sought another immediate review when confronted by Aleem Dar\u2019s finger, correctly confident that the ball had taken a firm inside edge. This was tough, taut fare as England mustered 61 runs in that first session. Runs came more freely after lunch when Root finally began to find the boundary with a series of deft glides and clips while Burns willed himself onward. They had added 136 when Siddle made the breakthrough. A firm\u2011footed drive from Root sped from the middle of the bat into bowler\u2019s slipway as he followed through. Siddle stuck out his right hand and there the ball came to rest. A pure batsman would have chided himself for not getting on top of the ball, a Botham would have been furious that he had not hit the ball harder and higher. Now the innings faltered. On either side of tea Joe Denly played two delicious cover drives but he fell soon after a ball change \u2013 it seemed the replacement was more willing to swing. Denly wisely declined to review when struck on the pads by a full-length delivery from Pattinson. Jos Buttler struck one crisp cover drive before edging to Cameron Bancroft at third slip off Cummins. Stokes now became a trusty ally for Burns. He saw him to three figures and survived the immediate recall of Lyon upon his arrival at the crease, a transparent adherence to some dossier despite the fact the ball was swinging around. Paine took the second new ball as soon as it was available, juggling his bowlers feverishly. This time they tried a review for lbw against Burns to no avail. After five overs Lyon was recalled. Even now England\u2019s opener was not batting flawlessly yet he was still heroically unbeaten at the close with the deficit reduced to 17.",

This issue is not limited to the UK, as it is very much a problem where I live in the Netherlands, too.</p> <p>Having had surgery and radiotherapy that has drastically altered my control over my bladder, I am someone who plans going out around the availability of adequate access to toilets. This becomes a particularly complex matter when going on holiday. I was therefore pleased to learn about a German system called <a href=\"http://www.die-nette-toilette.de\" title=\"\">nette toilette</a>.</p> <p>A number of German towns and local authorities (now in excess of 270) have worked out that it is much cheaper to get someone else to provide toilets than to have to fund their construction, operation and maintenance themselves. A council thus pays shops, cafes, etc that have toilets if they make them available to people who are not customers. (They then display a sign on the shop door/window.) I note from <a href=\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nette_Toilette\" title=\"\">the Wikipedia entry</a> that this new system is reckoned to cost the city of Bremen \u20ac150,000 a year rather than \u20ac1.1m to provide WCs themselves.</p> <p>I am also glad of another toilet-related development that you find more and more on this side of the Channel, namely the ability to pay at the turnstile of the WCs in stations and motorway services by using your bank card. Though those turnstile arrangements do tend to mean that you find that your wallet fills up with the little refund vouchers you get that you can spend in the associated cafes and shops.<br><strong>John Morris</strong><br><em>The Hague, Netherlands</em></p> <p>\u2022 Exeter city council \u2013 marketing mantra: \u201cLive Better\u201d \u2013 has just closed 15 of its 26 public toilets.

      "bodyText": "Owen Jones (No one should have to pay to pee, 2 August) confuses two issues: the provision of toilets and their cost, especially given that \u201cspend a penny\u201d has its origins in the concept of paying to pee, and when it started a penny was quite a large sum. It is, however, the need for toilets that can be used that truly matters. This issue is not limited to the UK, as it is very much a problem where I live in the Netherlands, too. Having had surgery and radiotherapy that has drastically altered my control over my bladder, I am someone who plans going out around the availability of adequate access to toilets. This becomes a particularly complex matter when going on holiday. I was therefore pleased to learn about a German system called nette toilette. A number of German towns and local authorities (now in excess of 270) have worked out that it is much cheaper to get someone else to provide toilets than to have to fund their construction, operation and maintenance themselves. A council thus pays shops, cafes, etc that have toilets if they make them available to people who are not customers. (They then display a sign on the shop door/window.) I note from the Wikipedia entry that this new system is reckoned to cost the city of Bremen \u20ac150,000 a year rather than \u20ac1.1m to provide WCs themselves. I am also glad of another toilet-related development that you find more and more on this side of the Channel, namely the ability to pay at the turnstile of the WCs in stations and motorway services by using your bank card. Though those turnstile arrangements do tend to mean that you find that your wallet fills up with the little refund vouchers you get that you can spend in the associated cafes and shops. John Morris The Hague, Netherlands \u2022 Exeter city council \u2013 marketing mantra: \u201cLive Better\u201d \u2013 has just closed 15 of its 26 public toilets. The endless sloganeering and vacuous manifesto-speak (\u201cWe want the narrative to be owned by individuals and organisations committed to playing a full part in the promotion of the city\u201d) take no account of the real and sometimes pressing needs so well described by Owen Jones. The \u201cnarrative\u201d is selective. Those who protested were ignored.

      "body": "<p>My mother, June Fraser, who has died aged 88, was a pioneering graphic designer. She began her career in the 1950s at Design Research Unit, a multidisciplinary London practice, where her prolific output included visual identities for Bata shoes and British Sugar, a logotype and packaging for Wedgwood, a logo for Sadler\u2019s Wells theatre, and packaging for the Royal Mint. </p> <p>Later, in 1980, she became head of graphics at John Lewis Partnership. Though she stayed there for only four years it was an incredibly prolific period, during which she was responsible for the packaging of a huge range of the partnership\u2019s own-brand goods under the Jonelle name. A challenge she particularly enjoyed was the redesign of wine labels for Waitrose.</p> <p>In 1984 she was recruited by the Design Council of Great Britain to head its industrial design division. Her responsibilities included selecting entries for the register of designers recommended to industry, awarding the black and white Design Council label to the best examples of British design on the high street, and the design and administration of exhibitions at the council\u2019s Haymarket HQ and on tour. She was also in charge of the Design Council\u2019s visual identity and editor in chief of its magazine, Design.</p> <p>The eldest of three daughters of Myrtle (nee Ward) and Donald Fraser, June was born in Assam, India, where her father was an engineer on a tea plantation. When he took a series of overseas postings with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in the 1930s, it was decided that June should go as a boarder to Talbot Heath school in Bournemouth; she did not see her parents or younger sister, Sally, again until their return to Britain after the second world war.</p> <p>My mother used to say that she was born with a pencil in her hand. With little access to materials, paper in particular during wartime, she would draw on anything she could get her hands on, including margins and endpapers of her story books. After leaving Talbot Heath, she enrolled at Medway School of Art in Kent, then transferred to Beckenham School of Art, which offered design as part of its curriculum. After graduating in the summer of 1954 she travelled to the Milan Triennale design exhibition where she joined the celebrity couple of mid-century design, Robin and Lucienne Day, to help set up the British stand. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"40cfac138e95f485d66015096f72ec0aebbed6e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40cfac138e95f485d66015096f72ec0aebbed6e1/0_24_640_384/500.jpg\" alt=\"A challenge June Fraser particularly enjoyed was designing Waitrose wine labels\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A challenge June Fraser particularly enjoyed was designing Waitrose wine labels</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: None</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the same year she gained a place at the Royal College of Art in London. Though trained in graphics, her interest spanned the entire design spectrum from product design to architecture, so upon leaving the RCA in 1957 she successfully applied for her first job with Design Research Unit. At DRU she met the interior designer Allen Cull, and they married in 1963.</p> <p>Among many achievements, June was the first female president of the Chartered Society of Designers (1983), served as a governor for several colleges of art and her old school, and was a director and later chairman (1995-97) of the Sign Design Society. In 1987 she was nominated to be the UK\u2019s representative on the Board of the International Council of Societies of Industrial Design.</p> <p>Energetic, ambitious, practical and hard-working, she continued to volunteer her expertise after retirement in 2001 to Beaminster in Dorset, and had finalised a book design just a few weeks before her death. Her appreciation of good design and aesthetics extended to every area of her life, including her home, her garden and her wardrobe.</p> <p>Allen died in 2017. June is survived by me and by two grandchildren, Xander and Isabel, and by her sisters, Sally and Joanna.</p>",

      "bodyText": "My mother, June Fraser, who has died aged 88, was a pioneering graphic designer. She began her career in the 1950s at Design Research Unit, a multidisciplinary London practice, where her prolific output included visual identities for Bata shoes and British Sugar, a logotype and packaging for Wedgwood, a logo for Sadler\u2019s Wells theatre, and packaging for the Royal Mint. Later, in 1980, she became head of graphics at John Lewis Partnership. Though she stayed there for only four years it was an incredibly prolific period, during which she was responsible for the packaging of a huge range of the partnership\u2019s own-brand goods under the Jonelle name. A challenge she particularly enjoyed was the redesign of wine labels for Waitrose. In 1984 she was recruited by the Design Council of Great Britain to head its industrial design division. Her responsibilities included selecting entries for the register of designers recommended to industry, awarding the black and white Design Council label to the best examples of British design on the high street, and the design and administration of exhibitions at the council\u2019s Haymarket HQ and on tour. She was also in charge of the Design Council\u2019s visual identity and editor in chief of its magazine, Design. The eldest of three daughters of Myrtle (nee Ward) and Donald Fraser, June was born in Assam, India, where her father was an engineer on a tea plantation. When he took a series of overseas postings with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in the 1930s, it was decided that June should go as a boarder to Talbot Heath school in Bournemouth; she did not see her parents or younger sister, Sally, again until their return to Britain after the second world war. My mother used to say that she was born with a pencil in her hand. With little access to materials, paper in particular during wartime, she would draw on anything she could get her hands on, including margins and endpapers of her story books. After leaving Talbot Heath, she enrolled at Medway School of Art in Kent, then transferred to Beckenham School of Art, which offered design as part of its curriculum. After graduating in the summer of 1954 she travelled to the Milan Triennale design exhibition where she joined the celebrity couple of mid-century design, Robin and Lucienne Day, to help set up the British stand. In the same year she gained a place at the Royal College of Art in London. Though trained in graphics, her interest spanned the entire design spectrum from product design to architecture, so upon leaving the RCA in 1957 she successfully applied for her first job with Design Research Unit. At DRU she met the interior designer Allen Cull, and they married in 1963. Among many achievements, June was the first female president of the Chartered Society of Designers (1983), served as a governor for several colleges of art and her old school, and was a director and later chairman (1995-97) of the Sign Design Society. In 1987 she was nominated to be the UK\u2019s representative on the Board of the International Council of Societies of Industrial Design. Energetic, ambitious, practical and hard-working, she continued to volunteer her expertise after retirement in 2001 to Beaminster in Dorset, and had finalised a book design just a few weeks before her death. Her appreciation of good design and aesthetics extended to every area of her life, including her home, her garden and her wardrobe. Allen died in 2017. June is survived by me and by two grandchildren, Xander and Isabel, and by her sisters, Sally and Joanna.",

But the popular-front tactic has deep antecedents in the very political traditions the modern Labour left emerged from. In 1935 the Bulgarian Communist leader Georgi Dimitrov single-handedly manouvered the Communist International into supporting calls for a \u201cpopular front\u201d against fascism. This was about formal electoral pacts with centrist socialists, left nationalist and liberals \u2013 and it paid off within six months. In Spain, to the fury of conservatives who had formed their own electoral alliance with the fascists, the Popular Front took power in January 1936. In May that year the Popular Front won in France, giving the country its first socialist prime minister.</p> <p>After Neville Chamberlain\u2019s peace deal with Hitler in 1938, Nye Bevan and Stafford Cripps, two key figures on the Labour left, advocated an electoral pact including Communists, Liberals and anti-fascist Tories. Both were expelled from the party in March 1939, but they paved the way for Labour\u2019s wartime coalition with Winston Churchill. So the popular-front tactic is not some piece of niche, retro-leftist memorabilia. It is the property of the western democratic tradition; the only tactic that halted or delayed the march to fascism in the 1930s. And it was invented by the Corbynistas of their day. So how could we make it happen now?</p> <p>The most obvious part of the proposition concerns the Green party. Up to a million people could simply vote Green as a protest, as they did in 2015, especially since the climate emergency is energising young voters. Labour should offer Caroline Lucas a place in the shadow cabinet now, a place in cabinet if it wins, and to stand down in her constituency and in up to two others where the Greens have a chance. In return, and for one time only, Labour should ask the Greens to stand down everywhere else and to join a united local campaign team. This should be done through formal negotiation beginning now.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/02/lib-dem-victories-help-labour-waste-time-fighting\">Labour shouldn\u2019t worry so much about the Lib Dems, they hurt the Tories more | Owen Jones</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is impossible to ask Labour activists in Scotland to do the same with the SNP.

      "bodyText": "Einstein is said to have defined insanity as doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result, but the connections of Battaash seem keen to put his theory to the test after the gelding\u2019s third consecutive success in the King George V Stakes here on Friday by moving on to York for another attempt to win the Group One Nunthorpe Stakes. The same path led only to disappointment in 2017 and 2018. Two years ago, after annihilating his field at Goodwood, Battaash was edgy and sweating from the moment he entered the paddock York, then all but refused to go into the stalls and finished only fourth of 11. On his next start, he was impeccably behaved and won the Group One Prix de l\u2019Abbaye at Chantilly by four lengths. Last season, Battaash was again devastating at Goodwood, and set off at odds-on for the Nunthorpe. Again, he failed to deliver. But having won Goodwood\u2019s Group Two once again in typically decisive style, York remains the only logical place to go, Einstein notwithstanding. \u201cI\u2019m quite emotional,\u201d Charlie Hills, Battaash\u2019s trainer, said. \u201cHe is a special horse. Jim [Crowley, his jockey] said he seemed to be idling in front, which is good because he is taking his racing much better and there are a good few races now we can target towards the end of the year. \u201cSheikh Hamdan [his owner] is keen to go to York next.He has not won there before, but I still scratch my head because there is no reason why he would not handle a track like that.

      "body": "<p>Guy Verhofstadt (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/31/boris-johnson-eu-no-deal-brexit-uk-government-backstop\" title=\"\">Opinion</a>, 1 August) says: \u201cAttempts to put pressure on Ireland will only be met with waves of solidarity from the rest of the EU.\u201d He could add that that solidarity will include the political leadership of the US. The Irish American constituency is a strong one, recognised by both Democrats and Republicans, and the US\u2019s involvement in the Good Friday agreement makes it a live issue there.</p> <p>Add to that the prospect of a US\u2013UK deal that opens the door for US medical insurance and the Democrats would love to see a lobby that did so much to harm Clinton and Obama defeated.</p> <p>Boris Johnson has brought unity \u2013 the unity of Washington and Brussels against us.<br><strong>Mary Pimm </strong><strong>and Nik Wood</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Ministers have evidently been instructed to parrot at every opportunity that the Irish backstop is \u201cundemocratic\u201d and must be scrapped as a precondition for further talks with the EU. Polly Toynbee rightly dismisses this approach as a nonsense (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/29/brexit-boris-johnson-repel-voters-fear-tories\" title=\"\">Johnson\u2019s crew will repel voters \u2013 there\u2019s no need to fear him</a>, 30 July).</p> <p>Johnson and his cabinet seem to be unaware that the final version of the backstop in the withdrawal agreement is not an EU invention imposed on this country. The original version, agreed between the EU and the UK, only affected Northern Ireland. It was changed to cover the UK as a whole because the UK insisted, under pressure from the DUP.</p> <p>If the freely negotiated backstop is to be regarded as undemocratic, and must be removed, what are we to make of the elevation of Boris Johnson to prime minister with the support of about 0.2% of the UK electorate? <br><strong>Mike Pender</strong><br><em>Cardiff</em></p> <p>\u2022 Much is being made of the backstop and \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d. I have one simple solution to both. Given that 55% of the people in Northern Ireland voted remain in the 2016 \u201conce in a generation\u201d referendum, an exception to that government assertion could be made for them alone, with another referendum and a clear binary question: \u201cDo you wish to remain in the EU or do you wish to remain in the UK\u201d? The two, we are constantly told, are mutually exclusive, so this decision has to be made sometime. Given that all the predicted problems associated with the backstop (many artificially manufactured by those intent on preventing Brexit of course) will mostly affect the 1.88 million inhabitants of that province, does this not seem a fair and (we hope) final way of killing those two challenging political birds with one stone?</p> <p>Then the rest of the leave-voting majority in the UK can perhaps finally see the delivery of what we voted for over three years ago and can get on with the rest of our lives, unencumbered by the tiresome and incessant debate over these two apparently insurmountable issues.<br><strong>Geoffrey </strong><strong>Lazell</strong><br><em>Bressingham, </em><em>Norfolk</em></p> <p>\u2022 Guy Verhofstadt says EU unity will not be broken by intimidation. Over hundreds of years the English have treated the Irish with disdain. And although we may have forgotten the million people who died of famine in the 1840s uncared for by the English landowners, the Irish have not. The roots of the Troubles were firmly set in the failure of Westminster to address religious discrimination and trying to appease Ulster Protestants. And now, to appease their English and Ulster Protestant supporters, the Tories are trying to get the EU to dump Ireland and the Good Friday agreement. If the Troubles return to Belfast or London it won\u2019t be hard to understand why.<br><strong>John Beer </strong><br><em>Farnham, Surrey</em></p> <p>\u2022 I come from Derry in Northern Ireland and I grew up through the Troubles. I have seen buildings explode and debris fly through the air. I have seen my friends lying in their coffins having died violent deaths and the uncomprehending grief on the faces of the brothers and sisters, the mums and dads. I never want to see such things again.</p> <p>The Good Friday agreement has ensured relative peace and normality on the island of Ireland for 20 years. The people of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland voted overwhelmingly for it in separate referendums. We must not allow the brutish rightwing government in Westminster, supported by the DUP, to destroy what has been achieved in Ireland (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/26/boris-johnson-uk-brexit-collision-course-irish-deputy-coveney\" title=\"\">Johnson sets UK on collision course with EU over backstop</a>, 27 July). Whether it is abortion, gay rights or Brexit, the DUP is no longer in step with the people of Northern Ireland.

      "bodyText": "Guy Verhofstadt (Opinion, 1 August) says: \u201cAttempts to put pressure on Ireland will only be met with waves of solidarity from the rest of the EU.\u201d He could add that that solidarity will include the political leadership of the US. The Irish American constituency is a strong one, recognised by both Democrats and Republicans, and the US\u2019s involvement in the Good Friday agreement makes it a live issue there. Add to that the prospect of a US\u2013UK deal that opens the door for US medical insurance and the Democrats would love to see a lobby that did so much to harm Clinton and Obama defeated. Boris Johnson has brought unity \u2013 the unity of Washington and Brussels against us. Mary Pimm and Nik Wood London \u2022 Ministers have evidently been instructed to parrot at every opportunity that the Irish backstop is \u201cundemocratic\u201d and must be scrapped as a precondition for further talks with the EU. Polly Toynbee rightly dismisses this approach as a nonsense (Johnson\u2019s crew will repel voters \u2013 there\u2019s no need to fear him, 30 July). Johnson and his cabinet seem to be unaware that the final version of the backstop in the withdrawal agreement is not an EU invention imposed on this country. The original version, agreed between the EU and the UK, only affected Northern Ireland. It was changed to cover the UK as a whole because the UK insisted, under pressure from the DUP. If the freely negotiated backstop is to be regarded as undemocratic, and must be removed, what are we to make of the elevation of Boris Johnson to prime minister with the support of about 0.2% of the UK electorate? Mike Pender Cardiff \u2022 Much is being made of the backstop and \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d. I have one simple solution to both. Given that 55% of the people in Northern Ireland voted remain in the 2016 \u201conce in a generation\u201d referendum, an exception to that government assertion could be made for them alone, with another referendum and a clear binary question: \u201cDo you wish to remain in the EU or do you wish to remain in the UK\u201d? The two, we are constantly told, are mutually exclusive, so this decision has to be made sometime. Given that all the predicted problems associated with the backstop (many artificially manufactured by those intent on preventing Brexit of course) will mostly affect the 1.88 million inhabitants of that province, does this not seem a fair and (we hope) final way of killing those two challenging political birds with one stone? Then the rest of the leave-voting majority in the UK can perhaps finally see the delivery of what we voted for over three years ago and can get on with the rest of our lives, unencumbered by the tiresome and incessant debate over these two apparently insurmountable issues. Geoffrey Lazell Bressingham, Norfolk \u2022 Guy Verhofstadt says EU unity will not be broken by intimidation. Over hundreds of years the English have treated the Irish with disdain. And although we may have forgotten the million people who died of famine in the 1840s uncared for by the English landowners, the Irish have not. The roots of the Troubles were firmly set in the failure of Westminster to address religious discrimination and trying to appease Ulster Protestants. And now, to appease their English and Ulster Protestant supporters, the Tories are trying to get the EU to dump Ireland and the Good Friday agreement. If the Troubles return to Belfast or London it won\u2019t be hard to understand why. John Beer Farnham, Surrey \u2022 I come from Derry in Northern Ireland and I grew up through the Troubles. I have seen buildings explode and debris fly through the air. I have seen my friends lying in their coffins having died violent deaths and the uncomprehending grief on the faces of the brothers and sisters, the mums and dads. I never want to see such things again. The Good Friday agreement has ensured relative peace and normality on the island of Ireland for 20 years. The people of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland voted overwhelmingly for it in separate referendums. We must not allow the brutish rightwing government in Westminster, supported by the DUP, to destroy what has been achieved in Ireland (Johnson sets UK on collision course with EU over backstop, 27 July). Whether it is abortion, gay rights or Brexit, the DUP is no longer in step with the people of Northern Ireland. It is ironic that the interests of the people of Northern Ireland are now best served by a Dublin government led by Leo Varadkar. The frictionless border and the Good Friday agreement must be supported and sustained whatever the outcome of Brexit. Daniel Taylor Brighton \u2022 Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s Mary Lou McDonald said this week that Johnson needed to stop being \u201cthe DUP\u2019s gofer\u201d (Sinn F\u00e9in warns Johnson: change is in the air, 1 August). The only reason that the Tory\u2013DUP alliance has a majority of one is that Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s seven MPs refuse to take up their seats in parliament. I understand the F\u00e9in abstentionist pledge, most recently articulated by Alex Maskey MP (I\u2019m a Sinn F\u00e9in MP.

John Birtill Guisborough, North Yorkshire \u2022 S\u00e9amas O\u2019Reilly (Leo Varadkar looks like an adult because the UK is acting like a spoilt toddler, 30 July) and Roy Greenslade (Blaming Leo Varadkar for no deal is bizarre \u2013 even for Britain\u2019s media, 31 July) write worryingly about offensive attitudes towards Ireland in parts of the UK\u2019s politics and media.

      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland will hand the government more than \u00a31bn as part of a windfall for shareholders but the payout was overshadowed by the bank\u2019s admission that it would miss its profit targets next year. The taxpayer-backed bank said it would pay a total of \u00a31.7bn in dividends for the first half of its financial year, partly funded by the sale of a stake in a Saudi Arabian bank. The UK government, which owns 62% of RBS after bailing it out during the financial crisis, will receive about \u00a31.05bn. RBS reported a 48% increase in first-half pretax profit to \u00a32.7bn and the bank\u2019s \u00a32bn net profit was its best result for more than a decade. But investors homed in on the bank\u2019s gloomy outlook as it highlighted tough market conditions, and economic and political uncertainty over Brexit. RBS said it was \u201cvery unlikely\u201d to reach its targets of 12% return on shareholders\u2019 funds and reducing costs to less than half of revenue next year. The bank said margins would continue to be compressed by competition for mortgage business, which had prompted some lenders to quit the market, and low interest rates. Bad debts rose by \u00a3182m to \u00a3323m, pushed up by problems at a small number of business customers. The bank\u2019s shares fell 6.5% to 202p. RBS\u2019s chairman Howard Davies said the bank expected a further period of uncertainty as concerns mount about the global economy and the prospect of the UK leaving the EU without a deal. \u201cThe subdued outlook for interest rates is affecting all banks, global economic growth prospects are less favourable, trade tensions between China and the US continue to be strained \u2026 and that\u2019s also affecting market confidence,\u201d Davies said. RBS had no news about its search for a new boss after chief executive Ross McEwan announced his departure in April and accepted the top job at National Australia Bank. Nicholas Hyett, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve had no update on who will be replacing Ross McEwan at the helm in 2020 \u2026 Whoever it is looks to have a big job ahead of them.\u201d",

Unfortunately, this method often causes the protruding body to snap off, leaving the head parts embedded in the skin. Retained head parts can cause infection, inflammation and discomfort.

      "bodyText": "Ed Sheeran\u2019s Divide Tour has been named the highest-grossing tour of all time, breaking a record set by U2 that had stood for eight years. Coming off the back of the chart-topping album of the same name, the Divide tour began in March 2017, and will have encompassed 255 shows when it finishes with four homecoming gigs in Ipswich later this month. So far it has grossed $736m (\u00a3607m), breaking U2\u2019s record of $735m, with 12 dates still left to play. It has also been named the most attended tour of all time: when it finishes, more than 8.5m people across 43 countries will have seen Sheeran perform, breaking U2\u2019s record of 7.3m. Writing on Instagram, Sheeran said: \u201cThanks so much for each and every one of you who have come to a show. 12 shows left, will never forget it.\u201d Sheeran\u2019s manager Stuart Camp told Pollstar, who amassed the tour data: \u201cWhat Ed has accomplished is truly incredible \u2026 to even be in the same ballpark as [U2] or spoken in the same sentence with a touring act like that is very humbling\u201d. U2\u2019s record was set in 2011 by their 110-date 360\u00b0 tour. Rather than focusing on stadiums as U2 did, Sheeran has included more intimate arenas \u2013 his average concert attendance is 34,541, around half U2\u2019s 66,091 average. He also rejected VIP areas and sold tickets at a relatively low price, 14.2% lower on average than U2\u2019s, but the sheer number of dates has ensured the record was broken nonetheless. Sheeran found time to record a new album during the tour, No 6 Collaborations Project, featuring all-star collaborations with the likes of Cardi B, Bruno Mars, Stormzy, Eminem and Justin Bieber. It was released on 12 July and is currently No 1 in the UK and US, while two of its singles, I Don\u2019t Care and Beautiful People, have topped the UK singles chart.",

It was the team\u2019s best finish since Fernando Alonso, Sainz\u2019s childhood hero, finished fifth in Australia last year. That position is the highest the team have managed in the past four years. For Sainz it was the latest in a run of admirable drives by the 24-year-old, who is seventh in the championship.</p> <p>However, impressive as this has been, it is far from where Sainz wants to be. \u201cI find it incredibly annoying going to every race to finish seventh, or even fifth,\u201d he says. \u201cI think everyone outside of the top six drivers finds it incredibly annoying. Some will say it, some won\u2019t but everyone that\u2019s in F1 at the moment has won in other categories.</p> <p>\u201cThen you are here and you spend five years or even longer without really having even a taste of a victory. It shows the sport needs to adapt and change to make it more diverse.\u201d</p> <p>He is not alone in an opinion that reflects the blunt reality of modern Formula One and he is understandably chafing at the bit for change. Sainz and his teammate, Lando Norris, have established McLaren as the best of the midfield teams, fourth in the constructors\u2019 championship, 28 points in front of Toro Rosso. But the gulf to the big three of Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull remains huge.</p> <p>McLaren are 147 points behind third-placed Red Bull. Since the turbo-hybrid era began in 2014, no one from outside the top three has won a race. Worse still, since 2017 there have been only three podium places taken by a driver from the remaining seven teams. As Sainz points out, his chances are largely dictated by how the leaders are performing.</p> <p>\u201cWe still depend on others making mistakes to be better than seventh,\u201d he says ruefully. \u201cAt the moment there are those three teams who are incredibly strong compared to us but I feel if they make mistakes we should be there to fish in the pond.\u201d</p> <p>Sainz, clearly, did not come into Formula One to be dangling his hook on the off-chance of a bite. His goal was and remains to become world champion, a target set when he was 11 years old and told his father: \u201cI want to be like Fernando Alonso. What do we need to do?\u201d Fortunately his father was Carlos Sainz, the double World Rally champion.

It\u2019s just that we are not able at the moment in the midfield to do that. I think 80-90% of the drivers in F1 now could fight for wins and world championships.\u201d</p> <p>Norris has rightly attracted acclaim for a competitive opening to his rookie season and the two drivers enjoy a friendly relationship in the increasingly optimistic atmosphere at McLaren. Sainz however has been scoring more of the points, a fact doubtless not lost on his previous employers at Red Bull. In the last eight races he has outscored Red Bull\u2019s Pierre Gasly by 48 points to 42. After 2016, as his chances of a drive with Red Bull declined, with Verstappen and Daniel Ricciardo established at the team, Sainz understandably began considering his options.</p> <p>He was allowed to drive for Renault on loan in the latter part of 2017 and then 2018 but, when Red Bull chose Gasly to replace Ricciardo this year, he chose to leave Red Bull for good for McLaren.</p> <p>He is one of the few drivers from the Red Bull stable who has managed to continue his career in F1 having not had a shot at the senior team.

      "bodyText": "Financial markets around the world fell sharply after Donald Trump threatened to impose a new tariff on $300bn (\u00a3248bn) of Chinese goods in a rapid escalation of the trade war between Washington and Beijing. The FTSE 100 was down more than 2% as markets across Europe tumbled on Friday, continuing a wave of selling pressure around the world in the aftermath of the president\u2019s announcement on Thursday evening. Wall Street also sold off sharply on Friday as investors continued to digest the president\u2019s decision to bring a trade truce with China to an abrupt end. Ending the worst week this year for US stocks, the the Dow Jones industrial average closed down 98 points (0.4%) at 26,485, having lost more than 280 points earlier in the day. Joshua Mahony, a senior market analyst at the financial trading firm IG, said: \u201cHopes of a resolution to the US-China trade war have been dashed once again. We are going around in circles, yet there is a feeling that this time we are unlikely to see tariffs averted by simply promising to resume talks.\u201d In a development likely to have severe ramifications for global growth, Trump said Washington would impose 10% tariffs on $300bn of Chinese goods, in effect placing additional border taxes on the total value of China\u2019s exports to the US. The White House already charges tariffs of 25% on $250bn of Chinese goods sold in the US as part of the long-running trade standoff. Total Chinese exports to the US were worth $539.7bn last year. Share prices in London tumbled, with the FTSE 100 closing down more than 150 points, or 2.3%, at 7,407. Germany\u2019s Dax index fell by more than 3%, while France\u2019s CAC 40 index was down 3.6%. Overnight shares in Shanghai dropped by 1.4% while Japan\u2019s Nikkei closed the day down by 2.1%. The MSCI index of world stocks dropped by 0.6% in a sign of selling pressure around the globe. The yields on US and German government bonds dropped as investors rushed into assets considered as safe havens amid global turmoil, with the yield on 10-year US treasuries falling to 1.832%, the lowest since November 2016. Trump said the fresh tariffs were a de facto punishment for Chinese noncompliance with previously agreed measures. In a flurry of tweets, the president said: \u201cWe thought we had a deal with China three months ago, but sadly, China decided to renegotiate the deal prior to signing.\u201d Beijing warned of retaliation on Friday and said it would not be bullied by Trump. The foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the country would not give an inch under pressure from Washington, Reuters reported. \u201cIf America does pass these tariffs then China will have to take the necessary countermeasures to protect the country\u2019s core and fundamental interests. We won\u2019t accept any maximum pressure, intimidation or blackmail,\u201d she said. The US-China trade dispute has had a chilling effect on the world economy as global trade volumes plummet and major companies pause investments. Growth has eased around the world, while several major countries have flirted with recession. Factory output has plunged across Europe, dragging down growth in Germany and Italy. Alongside the impact of Brexit, economic growth in Britain has dipped to stalling point amid the trade conflict. US economic growth has also slowed on the back of the dispute, putting pressure on the US Federal Reserve to cut interest rates to support the economy. The US\u2019s central bank cut rates this week for the first time in a decade. Tiffany Wilding, an economist at the bond fund manager Pimco, said it expected another rate cut as soon as September. \u201cGrowth in US manufacturing, investment and exports is likely to fall further over the next several months, and the Trump administration\u2019s latest announcement to impose additional tariffs on China is likely to only exacerbate the weakness,\u201d she said.",

In 2015, just five companies \u2013 Tyson Foods, Pilgrim\u2019s Pride, Perdue, Sanderson Farms, and Koch Foods \u2013 controlled about <a href=\"https://www.wattagnet.com/articles/25893-top---us-chicken-producers-grow-in-new-directions\">60%</a> of the entire chicken market. The companies <a href=\"https://www.nationalchickencouncil.org/industry-issues/vertical-integration/\">own and operate</a> all the means of production, including the feed mills, slaughterhouses, trucking lines and even the hatcheries that develop the best strains of chickens.</p> <p>Farms are the only part of the market these big companies don\u2019t own. Independent farmers borrow <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2017/06/22/533944458/farmers-take-out-millions-in-loans-to-raise-chickens-for-big-box-retailers\">millions of dollars</a> to build sophisticated warehouses, where they raise hundreds of thousands of chickens at a time. Crucially, though, they are not entirely independent. Farmers raise the birds under <a href=\"https://www.tysonfoods.com/who-we-are/our-partners/farmers/contract-poultry-farming\">contract</a> with an integrated company, giving firms strict control over operations. The poultry companies own the chickens, the feed, and even control the chickens\u2019 medical care. All farmers can do is try to raise the birds as efficiently as possible, even though most of the business is out of their hands.</p> <p>Critically, none of the information in Agri Stats\u2019 reports is available to the farmers themselves. This puts them at a severe disadvantage when they try to negotiate contracts or ask for pay rises, says <a href=\"https://aers.auburn.edu/people/robert-taylor/\">C</a><a href=\"https://aers.auburn.edu/people/robert-taylor/\"> Robert Taylor</a>, an emeritus professor at Auburn University and leading expert on anti-trust laws and enforcement in the meat industry, who calls it \u201cthe biggest imbalance in all of agriculture\u201d.</p> <p>The Agri Stats president, Brian Snyder, said in an email: \u201cAgri Stats strongly denies any and all allegations by farmers or plaintiffs in the ongoing lawsuits that Agri Stats reports can be used to coordinate either grower compensation or broiler prices \u2026 The work at Agri Stats is important and it really does help make protein production more efficient.\u201d</p> <p>Charles Morris, one of the largest chicken producers in Kentucky, works under contract for Tyson and is among several farmers who brought a <a href=\"https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/kentucky/kywdce/4:2015cv00077/94740/35/\">suit</a> against Tyson in 2015that remains ongoing.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re proud of what we do because we know we feed a lot of people in America and across the world,\u201d he says of poultry farmers. \u201cBut we\u2019re not proud of who we grow for any more.\u201d</p> <p>An obvious solution for farmers like Morris would be to sign up with another poultry company. Evidence suggests this rarely happens, however: a <a href=\"http://www.nationalchickencouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Live-Chicken-Production-FARMECON-LLC-FINAL-April-2016.pdf\">report</a> from the National Chicken Council, an industry trade group, found that in 2014 just 5% of growers switched poultry firms.</p> <p>One reason could be that poultry companies have an unspoken agreement not to poach farmers from one another. Farmers have alleged this, not least in a 2017 class action <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/55e8e9ece4b09a2da6c9b923/t/5899e07cf5e23192dad8d45e/1486479485000/Oklahoma+Poultry+Data+Case.pdf\">lawsuit</a>.</p> <p>Another reason for farmers\u2019 loyalty is that many poultry growers live in regions where, as a result of consolidation, there are just <a href=\"https://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/legacy/uploadedfiles/peg/publications/report/pegbigchickenjuly2011pdf.pdf\">one or two</a> processors left.</p> <p>\u201cIf we could go someplace else, we would grow chicken for someone else,\u201d<strong> </strong>says Morris.

The National Chicken Council found that average farmer pay fell more than 6% between 1988 and 2015 when measured in 2009 dollars. Meanwhile, consumers spent <a href=\"https://www.nationalchickencouncil.org/about-the-industry/statistics/broiler-chicken-industry-key-facts/\">$95bn</a> on chicken in 2019, and poultry companies have logged record-breaking <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-02-15/is-the-chicken-industry-rigged\">profits</a> in recent years. <br><br>\u201cWe\u2019ve all at one time or another contemplated having to file bankruptcy,\u201d says Morris.</p> <p>Asked to comment on farmers\u2019 allegations and on stagnant wages, Tom Super, senior vice-president of communications at the National Chicken Council, said the body has \u201cnothing to do with grower pay, which is determined by a business contract between two private parties\u201d.</p> <p>Gary Mickelson, director of media relations at Tyson Foods, said: \u201cThe average contract farmer has been raising chickens for us for 15 years. The compensation we provide is set out clearly in contracts the farmers voluntarily enter into and the contracts are typically three to seven years or longer. The farmers are free to discuss the terms of their contracts with whomever they want, including other farmers.\u201d</p> <h2><br>The secretive data-sharing company<br></h2> <p>Morris\u2019s suit names Agri Stats as a key player in the alleged scheme to reduce farmer pay. Morris has some experience with the company: he was once a <a href=\"http://www.getfilings.com/o0001193125-04-161341.html\">board member</a> of the poultry farmer collective Gold Kist, which was bought by Pilgrim\u2019s Pride in 2006. During his tenure, Agri Stats reports were seen as \u201cthe bible [of] the poultry industry\u201d<br><br>Agri Stats was founded in 1985 by poultry feed dealer Jim Cox, who told <a href=\"https://bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-02-15/is-the-chicken-industry-rigged\">Bloomberg Businessweek</a> in 2017 that the firm vetted its business model with an outside attorney to ensure conformity with anti-trust laws.</p> <p>The Department of Justice has also looked into whether Agri Stats\u2019 model violates anti-trust law. An investigation opened in <a href=\"https://www.docketbird.com/court-documents/USA-vs-See/MEMORANDUM-by-Agri-Stats-Inc-in-support-of-motion-for-protective-order-894/ilnd-1:2016-cv-08637-00895\">2010</a> closed two years later without the DoJ requiring the company to change anything about its business model.</p> <p>Now, the Trump administration has seemingly reopened the case. On 21 June, the DoJ <a href=\"https://thefern.org/ag_insider/justice-dept-intervenes-in-major-poultry-price-fixing-case/\">intervened</a> in a private sector class-action lawsuit filed by food distributor Maplevale Farm. The agency asked the US district court for the northern district of Illinois to stop work on the case temporarily to prevent interference with DoJ\u2019s own grand jury investigation.</p> <p>Agri Stats argued during the 2010 investigation that it operates simply as a benchmarking service, and that it preserves confidentiality among processors by masking the sources of the data it reports. A manager at Tyson, say, would see their particular \u201ccomplex\u201d \u2013 the collection of farmers surrounding a particular processing plant \u2013 listed by name in their version of a report, but the other complexes would be listed only as a number.</p> <p>In practice, however, there is evidence that the poultry companies can reverse-engineer the data to figure out which complex belongs to whom.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/09/american-food-giants-swallow-the-family-farms-iowa\">How America\u2019s food giants swallowed the family farms</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rita Korn, who worked for Agri Stats as a senior executive assistant and office manager from 1996 to 2013, says it was easy for poultry companies to figure out which plant was which. This was partly because the plant numbers did not change from report to report, Korn said.</p> <p>\u201cThose people all know each other,\u201d Korn says. \u201cAnybody that followed those numbers and had a brain in their head \u2013 if they were in top management at one of those places \u2013 they knew who was who in those books. Your job is to figure out who was who in this book. I think they cared more about that than they did their own numbers.\u201d</p> <p>Agri Stats denied during the 2010 investigation that the data in its reports were identifiable to industry insiders and said they couldn\u2019t be used by competitors in an anti-competitive manner because Agri Stats does not collect data on the nature of farmers\u2019 contracts with processors.</p> <p>Taylor says that in order for a collusive agreement to work, there has to be a mechanism in place to monitor competitors\u2019 behaviours and ensure no one is breaching the agreement. \u201cThat\u2019s where Agri Stats or something like Agri Stats can get in to a collusive arrangement,\u201d he says.</p> <p>In January, the two largest US food distribution companies, US Foods Inc and Sysco Corporation, brought <a href=\"https://www.meatpoultry.com/articles/17852-us-foods-sysco-sue-poultry-processors\">lawsuits</a> against Tyson Foods and other big poultry companies alleging that they used Agri Stats data as a tool to coordinate their production cuts, inflating prices for consumers.

A report for poultry companies produced by a secretive data-sharing firm, reviewed in a joint investigation by the Guardian and the Food and Environment Reporting Network (Fern), shows sensitive market information including how much producers are being paid per chicken. US anti-trust officials are currently conducting a grand jury investigation into poultry companies in response to a major class-action lawsuit alleging that the firms use information supplied by Agri Stats, a data company, to keep farmers\u2019 pay low and chicken prices high. Agri Stats produces daily reports for the poultry industry on chicken production, and has enabled companies to share detailed financial information with one another for decades.

Asked to comment on farmers\u2019 allegations and on stagnant wages, Tom Super, senior vice-president of communications at the National Chicken Council, said the body has \u201cnothing to do with grower pay, which is determined by a business contract between two private parties\u201d. Gary Mickelson, director of media relations at Tyson Foods, said: \u201cThe average contract farmer has been raising chickens for us for 15 years. The compensation we provide is set out clearly in contracts the farmers voluntarily enter into and the contracts are typically three to seven years or longer. The farmers are free to discuss the terms of their contracts with whomever they want, including other farmers.\u201d The secretive data-sharing company Morris\u2019s suit names Agri Stats as a key player in the alleged scheme to reduce farmer pay. Morris has some experience with the company: he was once a board member of the poultry farmer collective Gold Kist, which was bought by Pilgrim\u2019s Pride in 2006. During his tenure, Agri Stats reports were seen as \u201cthe bible [of] the poultry industry\u201d Agri Stats was founded in 1985 by poultry feed dealer Jim Cox, who told Bloomberg Businessweek in 2017 that the firm vetted its business model with an outside attorney to ensure conformity with anti-trust laws. The Department of Justice has also looked into whether Agri Stats\u2019 model violates anti-trust law. An investigation opened in 2010 closed two years later without the DoJ requiring the company to change anything about its business model. Now, the Trump administration has seemingly reopened the case. On 21 June, the DoJ intervened in a private sector class-action lawsuit filed by food distributor Maplevale Farm. The agency asked the US district court for the northern district of Illinois to stop work on the case temporarily to prevent interference with DoJ\u2019s own grand jury investigation. Agri Stats argued during the 2010 investigation that it operates simply as a benchmarking service, and that it preserves confidentiality among processors by masking the sources of the data it reports. A manager at Tyson, say, would see their particular \u201ccomplex\u201d \u2013 the collection of farmers surrounding a particular processing plant \u2013 listed by name in their version of a report, but the other complexes would be listed only as a number. In practice, however, there is evidence that the poultry companies can reverse-engineer the data to figure out which complex belongs to whom. Rita Korn, who worked for Agri Stats as a senior executive assistant and office manager from 1996 to 2013, says it was easy for poultry companies to figure out which plant was which. This was partly because the plant numbers did not change from report to report, Korn said. \u201cThose people all know each other,\u201d Korn says. \u201cAnybody that followed those numbers and had a brain in their head \u2013 if they were in top management at one of those places \u2013 they knew who was who in those books. Your job is to figure out who was who in this book. I think they cared more about that than they did their own numbers.\u201d Agri Stats denied during the 2010 investigation that the data in its reports were identifiable to industry insiders and said they couldn\u2019t be used by competitors in an anti-competitive manner because Agri Stats does not collect data on the nature of farmers\u2019 contracts with processors. Taylor says that in order for a collusive agreement to work, there has to be a mechanism in place to monitor competitors\u2019 behaviours and ensure no one is breaching the agreement. \u201cThat\u2019s where Agri Stats or something like Agri Stats can get in to a collusive arrangement,\u201d he says. In January, the two largest US food distribution companies, US Foods Inc and Sysco Corporation, brought lawsuits against Tyson Foods and other big poultry companies alleging that they used Agri Stats data as a tool to coordinate their production cuts, inflating prices for consumers. Food retailers Walmart, Kroger, Albertsons, and others have since brought similar suits. Agri Stats was recently dismissed as a defendant in a lawsuit that alleged it was used to facilitate anti-competitive behaviour in the beef sector.

Heathrow warned of longer security queues on 5 and 6 August after a ballot of Unite trade union members pointed to an \u201coverwhelming\u201d rejection of the airport\u2019s latest pay offer to security guards, firefighters, engineers and passenger service staff. Passengers have been advised to call their airline and check online for details about when to arrive at the airport, although Heathrow said contingency plans would minimise the impact on passengers. Unite warned that two more strikes could follow on 23 and 24 August, while a separate dispute between British Airways and its pilots is threatening to cause further disruption later this month. A Heathrow spokesperson said: \u201cWe are disappointed that Unite has rejected the latest pay offer and will continue to seek an agreement at [conciliation service] Acas. \u201cUnite is proceeding with its unnecessary strike action [\u2026] and we regret that passengers looking to get away on well-earned breaks will be impacted by this.\u201d Unite urged Heathrow to \u201cgive hardworking staff a pay rise\u201d to avoid 88,000 passengers being affected by the walkouts. The union said Heathrow\u2019s latest pay offer amounted to just \u00a33.75 more per day than its first offer and warned the airport could end up having to pay \u00a34.6m in compensation costs to airlines if two further strikes take place later in August. \u201cOur low paid members will sacrifice a day\u2019s pay if they go on strike and are only too aware of the disruption it will cause,\u201d said Wayne King, a regional officer at Unite. \u201cHowever, they are at a point where they have had enough with being given crumbs while shareholders pocket billions in dividends and the chief executive enjoys a pay rise of over 100%.\u201d The threat of strikes at Heathrow came as the chief executive of IAG, which owns British Airways, urged pilots threatening summer strikes to accept BA\u2019s \u201cgenerous\u201d pay offer. Willie Walsh, a former airline pilot and union negotiator turned airline boss, said he was not involved directly in pay negotiations but advised pilots to accept an 11.5% pay rise over three years. \u201cIf I was on management\u2019s side I wouldn\u2019t have made such a generous offer and if I was on the union side I would have grabbed it,\u201d he said. Talks with the pilots\u2019 union Balpa are continuing in an effort to stave off strikes that could begin this month if the union gives two weeks\u2019 notice of a walkout.",

      "bodyText": "Michael Adams, with six championship wins already under his belt, and David Howell, with three, were the pre-tournament favourites for this week\u2019s British title contest at Torquay and they are still locked in contention as the race, viewable free and live online, reaches its closing rounds this weekend. Sunday\u2019s final round starts at 10am to allow for a possible tie-break. After six of the nine rounds Adams and Howell led on 5/6, in front of a queue of a dozen would-be challengers half a point or a point behind. Adams has been ultra-solid while Howell has lived on the edge, both on the board and in handling his clock time. The two were paired in Friday\u2019s seventh round and agreed a draw after 21 moves of cautious sparring. If Adams fails to retain his title, one unexpected reason will be because two lower-rated rivals found a chink in his opening repertoire. Back in the 1990s when Adams was first a teenage talent, then a fast rising young grandmaster, he used a variety of defences to 1 e4, mainly the Caro-Kann 1....c6 but also the French 1...e6 and the Pirc 1...d6.

Meanwhile Howell won an adventurous game against the Cambridge student Matthew Wadsworth, 19, who like Haria has one GM norm and needs two more for the title. White\u2019s rook, knight and pawn were no match for Black\u2019s roving queen. Richard Palliser, who lost to Adams in round five, earlier set a strange record when his second and third round opponents, both grandmasters, defaulted due to illness. There was another upset in round five when Katarzyna Toma, who learned her skills in Poland, had a winning position against GM Keith Arkell after less than a dozen moves. Toma is already ranked No 4 among English women, and looks a sure selection for the 2020 Olympiad team. Indian prodigy, 13, is youngest to win major tournament India\u2019s prodigy Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa, who became the youngest ever international master at 11 and narrowly missed being the youngest ever grandmaster at 12, has set another landmark by winning the traditional Xtracon Open at Helsingor, Denmark, at 13 years 11 months. The Chennai boy scored an unbeaten 8.5/10 for a performance rating of 2741, the level of the world top 20.

And apocalyptic predictions matter even more when they don\u2019t come true.

Though it\u2019s slightly more worrying when a supposedly serious newspaper <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/2019/08/02/enough-gloomy-forecasts-bank-england-needs-get-behind-brexit/\" title=\"\">calls for the UK\u2019s independent central bank</a> to stop getting us all down with \u201cgloomy forecasts\u201d. </p> <p>But if the forecasts were wrong last time, why should we pay any attention to them this time? And what, realistically, can we actually know about the impact of no deal? Well, it\u2019s worth noting that while the Treasury certainly got the Brexit vote very badly wrong, the medium-term impacts haven\u2019t been that different from those projected by credible independent economists. The consensus is that, so far, we\u2019ve lost perhaps <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/14/brexit-has-cost-uk-economy-at-least-80bn-since-vote-bank-of-england-rate-setter\" title=\"\">1.5-2% worth of growth</a> and, with uncertainty taking an increasing toll on business confidence and hence investment, next week\u2019s figures are likely to show growth grinding entirely to a halt.</p> <p>But that doesn\u2019t mean we, or anyone else, know what the economic impact of no deal would actually be. Carney did make that absolutely clear, refusing to produce an economic forecast. There are two good reason to be cautious.</p> <p>First, while we know some of the consequences of no deal \u2013 customs controls, tariffs and new trade barriers \u2013 no one really knows how great the short-term disruption will be. Sky News has got hold of a leaked <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SamCoatesSky/status/1156989930477953025\" title=\"\">internal Whitehall slide</a> describing the worst-case scenario for the first month of a no-deal Brexit. It talks of UK nationals in other EU states losing residency and other rights; of a risk of increased crime; of the potential for an immediate halting of cross-border agricultural trade on the island of Ireland, of currency and financial market volatility. You get the picture.</p> <p>But the Cabinet Office doesn\u2019t produce documents like this simply to scare ministers. Its purpose is to put measures into place to mitigate the worst-case scenario. Even before the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/31/labour-attacks-appalling-waste-as-johnson-adds-2bn-no-deal-brexit-fund\" title=\"\">ramped up its no-deal planning</a>, much was already in place to ensure we don\u2019t run out of drugs or essential chemicals. And on the other side of the channel, the EU has put in place unilateral short-term measures in areas such as aviation and freight transport to cushion the shock. What we do not know is how long these measures will remain in place.</p> <p>Second, we don\u2019t know what the impact will be on consumer and business confidence. In 2016, the Treasury and others expected a big hit. As it turned out, the summer of 2016 saw nice weather, a World Cup and generally buoyant spending. Now, as then, we simply cannot be sure. And again, the government can act to mitigate the impacts by cutting taxes or increasing spending.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/01/exclusion-of-no-deal-from-analysis-renders-boes-projections-uncertain\">Exclusion of no deal from analysis renders BoE's projections uncertain</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What is important is not what happens on day one or week one after a no-deal exit, but how long it lasts and what happens next. Because no deal is not an event but the start of a process. In an optimistic scenario, the shock of no deal will bring both sides back to the table with strong incentives from domestic constituencies to find a way through. But sadly this seems far less plausible than a political downward spiral, with acrimony over money and the Irish border meaning negotiations go backwards before they can go forwards. And even when serious talking begins, the UK will be a third country. No article 50 and no withdrawal agreement means a lengthier and messier process.</p> <p>So there\u2019s no point shooting the messenger. When Carney \u2013 or other economists \u2013 say no deal will damage the UK economy but that it\u2019s hard, if not impossible, to say just how much, he\u2019s not a \u201cgloomster\u201d but simply stating the obvious. And when he says that while the Bank (and the Treasury) can help cushion the immediate impacts but sorting out the mess afterwards will be up to the politicians, he\u2019s not passing the buck but making clear that if politicians take us down that road, they will bear a heavy responsibility.</p> <p>\u2022 Anand Menon is director of UK in a Changing Europe.

Even before the government ramped up its no-deal planning, much was already in place to ensure we don\u2019t run out of drugs or essential chemicals. And on the other side of the channel, the EU has put in place unilateral short-term measures in areas such as aviation and freight transport to cushion the shock. What we do not know is how long these measures will remain in place. Second, we don\u2019t know what the impact will be on consumer and business confidence. In 2016, the Treasury and others expected a big hit. As it turned out, the summer of 2016 saw nice weather, a World Cup and generally buoyant spending. Now, as then, we simply cannot be sure. And again, the government can act to mitigate the impacts by cutting taxes or increasing spending. What is important is not what happens on day one or week one after a no-deal exit, but how long it lasts and what happens next. Because no deal is not an event but the start of a process. In an optimistic scenario, the shock of no deal will bring both sides back to the table with strong incentives from domestic constituencies to find a way through. But sadly this seems far less plausible than a political downward spiral, with acrimony over money and the Irish border meaning negotiations go backwards before they can go forwards. And even when serious talking begins, the UK will be a third country. No article 50 and no withdrawal agreement means a lengthier and messier process. So there\u2019s no point shooting the messenger. When Carney \u2013 or other economists \u2013 say no deal will damage the UK economy but that it\u2019s hard, if not impossible, to say just how much, he\u2019s not a \u201cgloomster\u201d but simply stating the obvious. And when he says that while the Bank (and the Treasury) can help cushion the immediate impacts but sorting out the mess afterwards will be up to the politicians, he\u2019s not passing the buck but making clear that if politicians take us down that road, they will bear a heavy responsibility. \u2022 Anand Menon is director of UK in a Changing Europe.

There is a beech tree which was probably 150 years old and an oak up to 250 years old.\u201d He said it would take a \u201chuge amount of time\u201d to resurface footpaths and reroute watercourses that had changed course, while the visitor car park was \u201ccompletely trashed\u201d. \u201cIt will be OK, things will recover, we can repair most of the damage but it will take time and there\u2019s going to be a cost to it. It would look devastating to some people. There has been significant damage.\u201d Flood warnings remain in place across Cheshire, including a severe alert, after up to 20mm of rain fell in the north-west in eight hours on Wednesday. The heavy rain came after a long dry spell and filled up streams and becks, which \u201ccompletely waterlogged the ground\u201d, Dunkerley recalled. \u201cThen Wednesday came and there was constant heavy rain, falling on to waterlogged ground and adding to volumes of water in all the streams, ponds and lakes. Rain just kept building and building up, then at 4pm things suddenly went from manageable to panic. We were running around with sandbags as streams and ponds were bursting their banks and water was coming up through the drains.\u201d A tractor had to tow cars out of the flooded visitor car park, while staff moved quickly to shore up the property with sandbags to successfully safeguard artefacts and antiques. The 600-year-old mansion, the focus of the grounds, was used as the home of Mr Darcy, played by Colin Firth in the BBC adaptation of Jane Austen\u2019s novel. It was not damaged. The National Trust said: \u201cFollowing the recent flooding, Lyme remains closed to the public to allow the clean-up work to be carried out and the full extent of the damage to be assessed. We will be reviewing the situation on Monday to establish how long Lyme will remain closed.\u201d\u201d",

Aberdeen were wounded by the loss of their influential captain Graeme Shinnie to Derby County but the signings of Craig Bryson and Ryan Hedges in particular imply Derek McInnes may be one of few top-flight managers to leave this transfer window stronger than he entered it. The same applies to Craig Levein and Hearts, whose league form imploded after a superb start a year ago. Hibernian\u2019s prospects are linked in large part to whether Scott Allan, after a spell in the wilderness at Celtic, can recapture form of an earlier stint at Easter Road. That Hibs lost Marc McNulty and St\u00e9phane Om\u00e9onga after impressive loans is significant. Motherwell have undertaken a hefty recruitment drive but more notable was the long-term injury incurred by the terrific David Turnbull. It would be a surprise if St Mirren, Hamilton and Livingston are not involved in a relegation scrap. This is a league where very little separates batches of teams; in previous generations, that was a sign of concerted strength. Not now, alas.",

It conjures up Hugh Hefner and satin sheets</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Of late, women\u2019s magazines have jettisoned stories about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/nov/22/victorias-secret-show-angels-lingerie\" title=\"\">extreme nil-by-mouth dieting</a> and exercise measures undertaken by the models in the run-up to the show, in favour of articles about body positivity. Lingerie brands aimed at young women, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/nov/09/the-victorias-secret-backlash-how-athleisure-inspired-bras-have-seen-off-the-sexy-look\" title=\"\">Aerie</a>, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/new-lingerie-brands-2018-6?r=US&amp;IR=T\" title=\"\">ThirdLove</a> and Lively, promote body diversity and oppose airbrushing. They seem miles away from the pornified aesthetic that girls \u2013 and I mean girls \u2013 were encouraged to adopt a couple of decades ago, in no small part due to Victoria\u2019s Secret. This was lingerie touted as empowering, but it didn\u2019t feel that way. That\u2019s not to say that lingerie didn\u2019t hold a sexual charge, but that charge felt mandated and tawdry.</p> <p>Victoria\u2019s Secret was originally launched to appeal to men, to provide a place where they could buy saucy underwear for their wives and girlfriends without feeling uncomfortable. It was based on the idea of a Victorian boudoir \u2013 hence the name \u2013 and the original shops were kitted out that way, all drapery and chandeliers. Perhaps this is why the chain found itself in trouble and was scooped up in 1982 by Wexler who supposedly made it more female-focused.</p> <p>Supposedly? Because, for me, being good at flogging products to women and acting in their interests is not the same thing; \u201cfemale focused\u201d doesn\u2019t mean \u201cfemale friendly\u201d. When I co-wrote a feminist book, The Vagenda, there was a whole chapter on the way lingerie is marketed. But whether you\u2019re critiquing lingerie or fad diets or magazines, the counter-argument was always the same: \u201cbut women are buying it\u201d \u2013 a view that failed to take into account socialisation (as though we emerge from the womb primed to be buyers of crotchless thongs), consumer choice, media imagery and the complex nature of sexuality and desire, not least how it interplays with female objectification.</p> <p>John Berger nailed the tension in Ways of Seeing, a decade before Wexner bought Victoria\u2019s Secret, when he wrote of the male gaze: \u201cA woman must continually watch herself. She is almost continually accompanied by her own image of herself. While she is walking across a room or while she is weeping at the death of her father, she can scarcely avoid envisaging herself walking or weeping. From earliest childhood she has been taught and persuaded to survey herself continually. And so she comes to consider the surveyor and the surveyed within her as the two constituent yet always distinct elements of her identity as a woman. She has to survey everything she is and everything she does because how she appears to men is of crucial importance for what is normally thought of as the success of her life. Her own sense of being in herself is supplanted by a sense of being appreciated as herself by another.\u201d It\u2019s a fortunate woman who hasn\u2019t felt this to some extent at some point in her life.</p> <p>As with any aspect of feminist critique, lingerie will induce mixed feelings in women depending on their body shape, cultural background, politics, income, sexuality, etc. There are no absolutes, as the beautiful <a href=\"http://www.zoebuckman.com/art/every-curve-art/\" title=\"\">artwork Every Curve</a>, by Zoe Buckman, demonstrates. Buckman hand-sewed Tupac and Notorious BIG lyrics about women on to gorgeous pieces of antique lingerie, in order to explore \u201cthe contradictory and complementary influences of feminism and hip-hop in her upbringing\u201d. Tracey Emin\u2019s use of blood-stained lingerie in My Bed, meanwhile, drew attention to feminine corporeality.</p> <p>Women may have been buying Victoria\u2019s Secret lingerie in their millions. Some women did undoubtedly feel empowered by it (just as others will feel empowered by simple cotton pants from M&amp;S). Nevertheless, we all know the joke about the Victoria\u2019s Secret catalogue, and its status as a male masturbation bible. Even those of us who didn\u2019t grow up in the US knew that Victoria\u2019s Secret was about pleasing men. The trick it so successfully pulled off was convincing many of us that pleasing men meant also always pleasing ourselves, but now women are voting with their feet. And I don\u2019t blame them. There\u2019s something cheap, tawdry and pass\u00e9 about the whole brand identity. It conjures Hugh Hefner, satin sheets, scenes from <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/glossy-shins-and-spots-of-light-1570149.html\" title=\"\">the novels of John Updike</a>.</p> <p>There is so much toss written about lingerie, about how it\u2019s a way of \u201cunleashing your inner goddess\u201d, so it\u2019s refreshing that comfort and inclusivity are now on the agenda. I\u2019m curious to see how Victoria\u2019s Secret will strive to reinvent itself in a post-#MeToo era. But some readers will no doubt say I\u2019m overthinking it. After all, as Dorothy Parker said, \u201cBrevity is the soul of lingerie.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist and author</p>",

Of late, women\u2019s magazines have jettisoned stories about the extreme nil-by-mouth dieting and exercise measures undertaken by the models in the run-up to the show, in favour of articles about body positivity. Lingerie brands aimed at young women, such as Aerie, ThirdLove and Lively, promote body diversity and oppose airbrushing. They seem miles away from the pornified aesthetic that girls \u2013 and I mean girls \u2013 were encouraged to adopt a couple of decades ago, in no small part due to Victoria\u2019s Secret. This was lingerie touted as empowering, but it didn\u2019t feel that way. That\u2019s not to say that lingerie didn\u2019t hold a sexual charge, but that charge felt mandated and tawdry. Victoria\u2019s Secret was originally launched to appeal to men, to provide a place where they could buy saucy underwear for their wives and girlfriends without feeling uncomfortable. It was based on the idea of a Victorian boudoir \u2013 hence the name \u2013 and the original shops were kitted out that way, all drapery and chandeliers. Perhaps this is why the chain found itself in trouble and was scooped up in 1982 by Wexler who supposedly made it more female-focused. Supposedly? Because, for me, being good at flogging products to women and acting in their interests is not the same thing; \u201cfemale focused\u201d doesn\u2019t mean \u201cfemale friendly\u201d. When I co-wrote a feminist book, The Vagenda, there was a whole chapter on the way lingerie is marketed. But whether you\u2019re critiquing lingerie or fad diets or magazines, the counter-argument was always the same: \u201cbut women are buying it\u201d \u2013 a view that failed to take into account socialisation (as though we emerge from the womb primed to be buyers of crotchless thongs), consumer choice, media imagery and the complex nature of sexuality and desire, not least how it interplays with female objectification. John Berger nailed the tension in Ways of Seeing, a decade before Wexner bought Victoria\u2019s Secret, when he wrote of the male gaze: \u201cA woman must continually watch herself. She is almost continually accompanied by her own image of herself. While she is walking across a room or while she is weeping at the death of her father, she can scarcely avoid envisaging herself walking or weeping. From earliest childhood she has been taught and persuaded to survey herself continually. And so she comes to consider the surveyor and the surveyed within her as the two constituent yet always distinct elements of her identity as a woman. She has to survey everything she is and everything she does because how she appears to men is of crucial importance for what is normally thought of as the success of her life. Her own sense of being in herself is supplanted by a sense of being appreciated as herself by another.\u201d It\u2019s a fortunate woman who hasn\u2019t felt this to some extent at some point in her life. As with any aspect of feminist critique, lingerie will induce mixed feelings in women depending on their body shape, cultural background, politics, income, sexuality, etc. There are no absolutes, as the beautiful artwork Every Curve, by Zoe Buckman, demonstrates. Buckman hand-sewed Tupac and Notorious BIG lyrics about women on to gorgeous pieces of antique lingerie, in order to explore \u201cthe contradictory and complementary influences of feminism and hip-hop in her upbringing\u201d. Tracey Emin\u2019s use of blood-stained lingerie in My Bed, meanwhile, drew attention to feminine corporeality. Women may have been buying Victoria\u2019s Secret lingerie in their millions. Some women did undoubtedly feel empowered by it (just as others will feel empowered by simple cotton pants from M&amp;S). Nevertheless, we all know the joke about the Victoria\u2019s Secret catalogue, and its status as a male masturbation bible. Even those of us who didn\u2019t grow up in the US knew that Victoria\u2019s Secret was about pleasing men. The trick it so successfully pulled off was convincing many of us that pleasing men meant also always pleasing ourselves, but now women are voting with their feet. And I don\u2019t blame them. There\u2019s something cheap, tawdry and pass\u00e9 about the whole brand identity. It conjures Hugh Hefner, satin sheets, scenes from the novels of John Updike. There is so much toss written about lingerie, about how it\u2019s a way of \u201cunleashing your inner goddess\u201d, so it\u2019s refreshing that comfort and inclusivity are now on the agenda. I\u2019m curious to see how Victoria\u2019s Secret will strive to reinvent itself in a post-#MeToo era. But some readers will no doubt say I\u2019m overthinking it. After all, as Dorothy Parker said, \u201cBrevity is the soul of lingerie.\u201d \u2022 Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist and author",

She was a founding member of Islington Writers for Children and the Black Women Writers Group and featured regularly as a speaker at British Council and Black History events and children\u2019s literature festivals. Ros was also a regular visiting author in schools in Islington, north London. Ros was modest about her courage and determination in overcoming the challenges of her childhood to live a full and adventurous life. She was surrounded with love from a close-knit community of family and friends, and is survived by her sons, Garikai and Danjuma, and grandson, Luca.",

      "body": "<h2>FOOTBALL IS BACK, BABY!</h2> <p>The season starts here! Or at least a bit of it does. Well, not exactly here, but now. Well, later. A bit of the season starts later, somewhere else! In what must go down as the most exciting thing ever to happen in Luton, a town so sleepy the entire county in which it resides was named Bedfordshire, the Football League curtain will be metaphorically raised at approximately 7.45pm BST this very evening, when either one of their players or one of Middlesbrough\u2019s kicks a ball.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/27/bielsa-bury-bolton-football-league-new-season\">Bielsa, Brentford and Bolton: the new Football League season</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What happens from there is, of course, anyone\u2019s guess, unpredictability being very much part of the game\u2019s appeal. But what we can say with near-absolute certainty is that a further nine Championship games will be played tomorrow, another on Sunday, and so on, with games held on an approximately biweekly basis from now/later until next May, by which time 552 matches \u2013 or, to put it another way, 828 match hours \u2013 will have been completed and everything will have been decided, except for the thing that isn\u2019t decided until another five games are also played.</p> <p>Meanwhile the League One and League Two seasons start tomorrow, each of them featuring an identical 828 match hours (depending on what happens to Bury and Bolton) for a combined total of 103.5 footballing days. In other words, if the Football League season was slightly compressed so that after kicking off in Luton the next game followed immediately afterwards, and the next after that, and so on so that there is always precisely one Football League match in progress, it would end at about lunchtime on Thursday 14 November. Whereupon the play-offs would take place, concluding (depending on whether stoppage time is required) in the early hours of the following day.</p> <p>Add in the Charidee Shield, 380 Premier League matches, 91 games in the EFL Cup, 123 in the FA Cup (from the first round onwards) and 127 in the EFL Trophy, and you get a further 1,083 match hours. So if you were to run all top-level English competitive football on a similar basis, with one match in progress at all times of every day from 7.45pm this evening until everything is decided, the final whistle would blow in the early hours of 30 December. It\u2019s probably best not to get into Europe at this stage.</p> <p>That\u2019s 2,378 matches, including play-offs. Let\u2019s say there is an average of five minutes\u2019 stoppage time per match (that\u2019s another eight days, eight hours and some small change), a token 48 of the cup games go to extra-time (another day) and that 25 FA Cup games go to replays (a further 37.5 hours).

      "bodyText": "FOOTBALL IS BACK, BABY! The season starts here! Or at least a bit of it does. Well, not exactly here, but now. Well, later. A bit of the season starts later, somewhere else! In what must go down as the most exciting thing ever to happen in Luton, a town so sleepy the entire county in which it resides was named Bedfordshire, the Football League curtain will be metaphorically raised at approximately 7.45pm BST this very evening, when either one of their players or one of Middlesbrough\u2019s kicks a ball. What happens from there is, of course, anyone\u2019s guess, unpredictability being very much part of the game\u2019s appeal. But what we can say with near-absolute certainty is that a further nine Championship games will be played tomorrow, another on Sunday, and so on, with games held on an approximately biweekly basis from now/later until next May, by which time 552 matches \u2013 or, to put it another way, 828 match hours \u2013 will have been completed and everything will have been decided, except for the thing that isn\u2019t decided until another five games are also played. Meanwhile the League One and League Two seasons start tomorrow, each of them featuring an identical 828 match hours (depending on what happens to Bury and Bolton) for a combined total of 103.5 footballing days. In other words, if the Football League season was slightly compressed so that after kicking off in Luton the next game followed immediately afterwards, and the next after that, and so on so that there is always precisely one Football League match in progress, it would end at about lunchtime on Thursday 14 November. Whereupon the play-offs would take place, concluding (depending on whether stoppage time is required) in the early hours of the following day. Add in the Charidee Shield, 380 Premier League matches, 91 games in the EFL Cup, 123 in the FA Cup (from the first round onwards) and 127 in the EFL Trophy, and you get a further 1,083 match hours. So if you were to run all top-level English competitive football on a similar basis, with one match in progress at all times of every day from 7.45pm this evening until everything is decided, the final whistle would blow in the early hours of 30 December. It\u2019s probably best not to get into Europe at this stage. That\u2019s 2,378 matches, including play-offs. Let\u2019s say there is an average of five minutes\u2019 stoppage time per match (that\u2019s another eight days, eight hours and some small change), a token 48 of the cup games go to extra-time (another day) and that 25 FA Cup games go to replays (a further 37.5 hours). Now top-level domestic football is being played non-stop from 7.45pm this evening until lunchtime on 9 January, assuming there are never any penalty shoot-outs. So, to conclude, a bit of the season starts later \u2013 there\u2019s probably still time for a pint. \u2026 SKY SPORTS YELLOW BREAKING NEWS TICKER OF DOOM \u2026 MANCHESTER UNITED AGREE \u00a380M DEAL FOR HARRY MAGUIRE \u2026 MANCHESTER UNITED AGREE \u00a380M DEAL FOR HARRY MAGUIRE \u2026 MANCHESTER UNITED AGREE \u00a380M DEAL FOR HARRY MAGUIRE \u2026 LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Will Unwin for red hot minute-by-minute coverage of Luton Town 0-0 Middlesbrough at 7.45pm BST.

Instead, it\u2019s because of how close they came to holding on to the seat. Ahead of the vote, the Conservatives had appeared to be following a beginner\u2019s guide on how to lose byelections and alienate voters. The vote had been triggered by a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/21/petition-to-recall-convicted-tory-mp-chris-davies-succeeds\" title=\"\">recall petition</a> after the incumbent Tory MP, Chris Davies, was found guilty of submitting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/23/tory-mp-chris-davies-fake-expenses-claim-brecon-radnorshire\" title=\"\">fake expenses claims</a>. The Conservative response? To reselect him as a candidate \u2013 rather than opt for a baggage-free contender.</p> \n<p>As for the campaign, it\u2019s not as though the Tories went all out. MPs complain of a \u201cdefeatist\u201d attitude in Conservative campaign headquarters. Boris Johnson made a perfunctory visit to the seat on his first trip to Wales as prime minister. A handful of Tory MPs tweeted that they would be out campaigning. The general mood was that the Liberal Democrats were on an unstoppable path to victory and the Tory working majority in parliament would be reduced to one. It followed that it was beneficial to have a candidate they could blame the loss on rather than a defeat that could be cast as the new leader falling short.</p> \n<p>In the end it was close. The Liberal Democrats did succeed in turning over Davies\u2019s 8,038 majority \u2013 winning the seat back with a majority of 1,425. To the Lib Dems\u2019 13,826 votes, the Tories managed 12,401. That means the seat ought to be a target seat for the party at the next general election, one that could come sooner rather than later.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6cd021e3-b92e-4d4d-920f-998de73ff2c6\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There are 650 MPs in total.

They also have 10 Democratic Ulster Unionist MPs who have agreed to vote with the government on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/11/confidence-and-supply-what-does-it-mean-and-how-will-it-work-for-the-new-government\">confidence and supply</a> basis, giving Boris Johnson a bloc of 320 MPs.</p>\n    <p>In opposition, the Labour party have 245 MPs, the Scottish National party have 35, the Liberal Democrats 13, Plaid Cymru four and the Green party one. This adds up to a bloc of 298.</p>\n    <p>There are 11 MPs who do not vote: the Speaker and his three deputies, and the seven Sinn F\u00e9in MPs who do not attend the Commons as a matter of principle.<br></p>\n    <p>There are 21 MPs who are either independent, or part of the Independent Group for Change. If all of these MPs vote against the government, along with the opposition parties, this totals 319, giving the prime minister a working majority of one.<br></p>\n    <p>In practice, one of those independents, Charlie Elphicke, who is currently suspended from the Tory party while charged with sexual assault, is likely to vote with the government. A further complication is that the Labour MP Jared O\u2019Mara has been largely absent from parliament and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/27/ex-labour-mp-jared-omara-to-resign-from-parliament\">says he intends to quit</a> in September.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>While some Tories are more upbeat than usual for a byelection loss (with others angry that more effort wasn\u2019t put in), the result ought to give Johnson pause for thought on how his party should pitch itself in a general election. Part of the reason the Liberal Democrats succeeded in the seat is that they benefited from a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/05/pro-emain-parties-strike-brecon-and-radnorshire-byelection-pact-to-fight-conservatives\" title=\"\">remain alliance</a>. Plaid Cymru and the Greens agreed not to stand, in a bid to help a remain MP get elected. The success of this arrangement means it would likely be repeated in a general election. However, the Conservatives have no current route to a pro-Brexit alliance to counter this. Instead, the nearest pro-Brexit party is proving a thorn in their side.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a415792fbc0f160bfacd62c6aa5d169bbb5e3523\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a415792fbc0f160bfacd62c6aa5d169bbb5e3523/0_261_4821_2892/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nigel Farage at a Brexit party event in June\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The idea of doing a deal with Farage wouldn\u2019t just be damaging to Johnson\u2019s ego.

This cannot be described as the performance of a party on the cusp of breaking the two-party system, as Nigel Farage has predicted. However, it could cost the Tories a general election.

      "bodyText": "The Brecon and Radnorshire byelection result was a surprise for many Tory MPs \u2013 but not because they lost. Instead, it\u2019s because of how close they came to holding on to the seat. Ahead of the vote, the Conservatives had appeared to be following a beginner\u2019s guide on how to lose byelections and alienate voters. The vote had been triggered by a recall petition after the incumbent Tory MP, Chris Davies, was found guilty of submitting fake expenses claims. The Conservative response? To reselect him as a candidate \u2013 rather than opt for a baggage-free contender. As for the campaign, it\u2019s not as though the Tories went all out. MPs complain of a \u201cdefeatist\u201d attitude in Conservative campaign headquarters. Boris Johnson made a perfunctory visit to the seat on his first trip to Wales as prime minister. A handful of Tory MPs tweeted that they would be out campaigning. The general mood was that the Liberal Democrats were on an unstoppable path to victory and the Tory working majority in parliament would be reduced to one. It followed that it was beneficial to have a candidate they could blame the loss on rather than a defeat that could be cast as the new leader falling short. In the end it was close. The Liberal Democrats did succeed in turning over Davies\u2019s 8,038 majority \u2013 winning the seat back with a majority of 1,425. To the Lib Dems\u2019 13,826 votes, the Tories managed 12,401. That means the seat ought to be a target seat for the party at the next general election, one that could come sooner rather than later. While some Tories are more upbeat than usual for a byelection loss (with others angry that more effort wasn\u2019t put in), the result ought to give Johnson pause for thought on how his party should pitch itself in a general election. Part of the reason the Liberal Democrats succeeded in the seat is that they benefited from a remain alliance. Plaid Cymru and the Greens agreed not to stand, in a bid to help a remain MP get elected. The success of this arrangement means it would likely be repeated in a general election. However, the Conservatives have no current route to a pro-Brexit alliance to counter this. Instead, the nearest pro-Brexit party is proving a thorn in their side. The Brexit party won 3,331 votes in the byelection. This cannot be described as the performance of a party on the cusp of breaking the two-party system, as Nigel Farage has predicted. However, it could cost the Tories a general election. If less than half of the voters who moved to the Brexit party had backed the Tories, the Conservatives would have kept hold of the seat. This is a problem as a Tory/Brexit party electoral pact is unlikely. Johnson has repeatedly ruled out agreeing to an electoral pact with the Brexit party, and Farage has said he has no plans to stand his party down. Throughout the Tory leadership campaign, Johnson won cheers and support by saying that he was the leader to put the Brexit party back in its box. The idea of doing a deal with Farage wouldn\u2019t just be damaging to Johnson\u2019s ego. A bulk of Tory MPs view it as electorally toxic. There is a sense that the route to winning a majority at a general election rests on not only uniting the leave vote \u2013 but also keeping Tory remain voters on side. Will this result put Johnson off the prospect of an early election? With a majority of just one, it is not really in the Tories\u2019 hands to decide. The only way to definitely avoid one is to extend article 50 if no deal can be reached \u2013 as Theresa May did. However, this would go down terribly with their core support and likely push more voters to Farage. It follows that the options ahead for winning an election are limited.

      "bodyText": "Tourists and Hindu pilgrims visiting a Himalayan cave shrine in Indian-administered Kashmir have been advised by the government to leave the area immediately, amid heightened tensions and fears of possible unrest. Officials said they had recovered a Pakistani-made mine, as well as ammunition, explosives and other weapons, after intelligence suggested attacks were planned on routes used by the hundreds of thousands of people trekking to the Amarnath cave. Kashmir\u2019s home secretary, Shaleen Kabra, said in a statement: \u201cIn the interest of safety and security of the tourists and Amarnath Yatris [pilgrims], it is advised that they may curtail their stay in the [Kashmir] valley immediately.\u201d It follows India\u2019s announcement last week that it would deploy an extra 10,000 troops in Kashmir, which caused panic in the disputed region. This year, about 300,000 people embarked on the 45-day annual pilgrimage to the cave shrine, located high in the mountains. It is not uncommon for Hindu pilgrims to be targeted \u2013 seven were killed in a bus attack in 2017 \u2013 but an order asking people to leave is rare. Kashmir is claimed by India and Pakistan in full and ruled in part by both. An insurgency has waxed and waned on the Indian-administered side for three decades, and tens of thousands of people have been killed. On Friday, an improvised explosive device hit an Indian army vehicle in southern Pulwama district while a gunfight raged in nearby Shopian district. A series of orders leaked last week caused alarm in the region. One told Indian Railways staff in the Kashmir valley to stock enough dry rations to last four months and referred to a \u201cforecast of deteriorating situation\u201d. The influx of 10,000 extra troops also prompted rumours that Delhi may be preparing to scrap Kashmir\u2019s special status, which prohibits people from outside of the state from buying land in the disputed territory. \u201cThe deployment of troops is a very significant move, and this usually happens when the government is anticipating a law and order situation,\u201d said Khalid Shah, an associate fellow at the Observer Research Foundation. \u201cThere is a significant degree of panic among the people because they have no clarity on what is really going to happen.\u201d Umar, a state government employee who was willing to be identified only by his first name, said people were living in a state of uncertainty. He said he was due to get married later this month but was worried he might be forced to cancel the wedding. \u201cWithin the family we are discussing what to do. We have options to cut short the functions and make the ceremony as quick as possible, but we are also unsure at this point if that is even possible,\u201d he said. Amid the confusion, residents have rushed to ATMs to withdraw money and long queues have formed outside petrol stations. Narendra Modi\u2019s ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) has promised to scrap article 35A of the Indian constitution, which protects the demography of Muslim-majority Kashmir by prohibiting non-state subjects from buying land. However, analysts say doing so would almost certainly trigger unrest and reignite tensions with Pakistan, and that the government would be unlikely to take such action during the Amarnath Yatra, which ends in mid-August. In February, more than 40 Indian paramilitaries were killed in a suicide car bombing that brought India and Pakistan close to a war. Since then, there has been a decrease in incidents, but the former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mehbooba Mufti, who headed an alliance government with the BJP, described the situation as \u201cdisconcerting\u201d and warned of a misinformation campaign. On Friday, India\u2019s external affairs minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, again rejected Donald Trump\u2019s offer to mediate in the dispute with Pakistan over Kashmir. The US president\u2019s claim last month that Modi had asked him to intervene was quickly denied by Delhi, where it fuelled anger in parliament. Jaishankar said he told the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, who he met on the sidelines of an Asian security forum in Bangkok, that any talks over the disputed region would be between India and Pakistan only. Trump had reiterated his offer to intervene on Thursday.",

Beijing is now promising to retaliate if the US doesn\u2019t back down, ramping up a trade war that investors had hoped was winding down Shares in Asia plunged overnight after sharp falls on Wall Street, ensuring that European stocks fell into the red first thing on Friday morning. Those caught in the cross fire include the FTSE 100 and German Dax, which were down 2.1% and 2.5%, respectively in afternoon trading All eyes were on US jobs data by the afternoon. However, markets barely reacted as non-farm payrolls for July were reported in-line with economists\u2019 forecasts collected by Refinitiv, at 164,000. June\u2019s reading of 224,000 was revised down to 193,000. The Bank of Finland governor Olli Rehn confirmed he has withdrawn from the race to become the next managing director of the International Monetary Fund, leaving two candidates to battle it out for the post. Sources told Reuters that the race was now between the former head of eurozone finance ministers Jeroen Dijsselbloem, and the World Bank chief executive Kristalina Georgieva. We\u2019ll be back on Monday. Have a great weekend! The Bank of Finland governor Olli Rehn has confirmed that he has withdrawn from the race to become the next managing director of the International Monetary Fund. Reuters, citing a source, is saying this leaves European governments to choose between two candidates: the former head of eurozone finance ministers Jeroen Dijsselbloem, and the World Bank chief executive Kristalina Georgieva. The S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq and Dow have all opened at one-month lows: S&amp;P 500 down 0.35% Dow Jones down 0.27% Nasdaq down 0.64% US futures are pointing to a lower open for stocks stateside, though the declines look relatively muted compared to the slump we saw in yesterday\u2019s session: S&amp;P 500 is called down 0.23% Dow is expected to fall 0.10% Nasdaq looks on track to drop 0.62% Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, says: The US jobs market is in a good place. Unemployment has stayed flat while productivity goes from strength to strength. Moderate wage growth will give the Fed pause for thought when it comes to further monetary easing but, so long as productivity gains continue to gather pace, inflation shouldn\u2019t be cause for concern. More worrying is the business spending landscape. Corporate investment is low, with firms sitting on cash and engaging in share buy-backs rather than investing in the labour market. Digital transformation spending is contributing to productivity and should be encouraged, but with the trade war escalating and global slowdown spiralling it\u2019s no surprise that business confidence has slumped. It\u2019s too soon to say what impact the new tariffs will have on the US economy and labour market, but Powell will need to be pragmatic and flexible if he hopes to sustain the expansion. Here\u2019s our full story on the jobs figures: With most of the data matching economists\u2019 forecasts, there is not a lot of market reaction to the non-farm payroll figures. However, we\u2019re seeing a slight rise in the US dollar, which took a spill after Trump\u2019s trade threats overnight: More on the US jobs data: The US unemployment rate also matched forecasts exactly, staying steady at 3.7% in July Average earnings rose 3.2% year-on-year, at a slightly faster pace than the 3.1% reported in June. Economists had been predicting a 3.1% rise US non-farm payroll data shows that there were 164,000 jobs added to the US economy in July, exactly as economists polled by Refinitiv had forecast. The June figure of 224,000 was revised down to 193,000. More soon... Trump\u2019s pending trade tariffs on the remaining $300bn worth of Chinese goods are likely to have severe ramifications for global growth, Richard Partington reports. The White House already charges tariffs of 25% on $250bn of Chinese goods sold in the US as part of the long-running trade standoff. Total Chinese exports to the US were worth $539.7bn last year. The US-China trade dispute has had a chilling effect on the world economy as global trade volumes plummet and major companies pause investments. Growth has eased around the world, while several major countries have flirted with recession. Factory output has plunged across Europe, dragging down growth in Germany and Italy. Alongside the impact of Brexit, economic growth in Britain has dipped to stalling point amid the trade conflict. US economic growth has also slowed on the back of the dispute, putting pressure on the US Federal Reserve to cut interest rates to support the economy. The US\u2019s central bank cut rates this week for the first time in a decade. Less than an hour to go before US non-farm payroll data for July is released at 13:30 BST. Economists estimates suggest around 164,000 jobs were added last month, which would be a drop from 224,000 in June. But given the trade war distractions, some analysts say the all-important US jobs figure could end up having a smaller influence on the next Fed interest rate decision. Naeem Aslam at online trading platform ThinkMarkets said: The US NFP data is due later today. It has always been the centre of attention but today it can no longer occupy that space. I am not saying that this event is going to be meaningless, I believe the importance of this event is going to be in a different way. A good number isn\u2019t going to support anything and traders should not expect any cautious stance from the Fed on the back of this. The new tax levies introduced by Donald Trump on China have made the Fed\u2019s monetary policy path a one way street. In simple term, if the data is weak, it is easy for the Fed to sell their dovish stance, but now under these new circumstances, the Fed cannot say that do not expect \u201ca new trend\u201d of interest rate cuts. New tariffs on China mean escalation of war and this is likely to result in much lower growth and the Fed would be forced to use their weapon of interest rate cut. Investors are also turning to low-risk German bonds in an attempt to safeguard their cash. Higher demand has driven up prices, but sent yields \u2013 which measure the rate of return \u2013 on Germany\u2019s 30-year bonds near 0% While safe haven assets like gold are riding high on the back of market jitters, prices for metals like copper are falling. The US-China trade dispute stands to weaken global economic growth and demand for metals. Benchmark copper prices are down around 1.4% at $5,816 per tonne and have fallen 2.5% over the week. Trump may be gambling with his voter base by inching towards tariffs on consumer goods that come from China like tech and toys, says CMC Markets UK analyst Michael Hewson: European markets have sunk like a stone this morning after President Trump\u2019s unexpected decision to announce 10% tariffs on the remaining $300bn of Chinese goods, from the 1st September. It is difficult to understand the President\u2019s thinking here given that these particular tariffs are likely to hit his base the hardest, given that these goods will include the staples of the US consumer, like apparel, toys and electrical goods. This helps explain why US retailers felt the brunt of last night\u2019s sell off in the US yesterday, as pressure builds to absorb any price increases into their margins. It\u2019s also important to remember that US consumer confidence rebounded strongly in July. It\u2019s likely to take a big hit lower if these tariffs come to pass. Back in the UK, holidaymakers are being hit with news that two travel companies have gone bust. Mark Sweney reports: Holiday firms Late Rooms and York-based Super Break have collapsed, affecting more than 50,000 travellers. Malvern Group, which owns the booking website LateRooms.com and Super Break, said about 400 Super Break customers were on holiday in the UK or overseas. Super Break was a member of Abta and the travel trade body said that most customers affected should be able to get a refund for their trip. It added that those already away should be able to continue with their holiday as normal. The two companies had about 53,000 customers between them, involving 20,000 bookings, with most holidaymakers yet to start their trips. China has warned that it will retaliate if Trump follows through with his latest tariff threats. At a news briefing in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said: If America does pass these tariffs then China will have to take the necessary countermeasures to protect the country\u2019s core and fundamental interests. She said China hopes the US would give up its \u201cillusions\u201d and return to negotiations on the basis of respect and equality. We won\u2019t accept any maximum pressure, intimidation or blackmail. On the major issues of principle we won\u2019t give an inch. The German stock market is one of the worst-hit among major European indices caught in the middle of the US-China trade war. The Xetra DAX opened lower by around 2.3% and is now down 2.5% Fiona Cincotta, a senior market analyst at City Index, says it could fall further depending on what eventually comes of Trump\u2019s EU trade announcement later today: Caught in the crossfire European markets plunged on opening with the FTSE dropping 1.78% and the heavily China-exposed DAX falling 2.3%. The German index could end up having an even worse day later when President Trump is due to make an announcement about European trade. Given the President\u2019s less than conciliatory mood it is likely that the threatened tariffs on European Union cars, Airbus and food and alcohol could be back on the agenda. And in corporate news, we\u2019ve had at least three FTSE 100 firms announce results this morning: Royal Bank of Scotland is at the bottom of London\u2019s blue chip index after the bank warned that deteriorating economic conditions in the lead up to Brexit would hit profits and cost targets next year. Even a \u00a31.7bn shareholder payout couldn\u2019t soften the blow, sending shares down more than 6% to 203.5p. In contrast, British Airways owner IAG is holding the top spot on the FTSE 100, up 2.4% at 423.6p. The company this morning reported operating profit of \u20ac960m, above City estimates of \u20ac914m, as revenues per passenger rose 1% in the second quarter. IAG\u2019s CEO Willie Walsh said he had seen no impact on bookings due to Brexit. Meanwhile, BT fell 3% to 188p per share despite beating analyst forecasts for first quarter earnings. The telecoms giant, which owns mobile operator EE, reported a 1% drop in first quarter adjusted revenue to \u00a35.63bn, higher than expectations for \u00a35.59bn. Adjusted core earnings of \u00a31.96bn was above forecasts of \u00a31.89bn, but analysts said its consumer division failed to deliver. The prospect of a ramped up US-China trade war has caused investors to dump stocks in favour of safe haven assets including gold. The precious metal\u2019s price could face higher demand if this afternoon\u2019s US jobs numbers fail to meet forecasts. Lukman Otunuga, Senior Research Analyst at FXTM says: Gold glittered with extreme intensity on Thursday, jumping to a fresh two week high above $1445 as Trump\u2019s tariff tweets sent investors stampeding for safety. The precious metal has scope to push higher this afternoon if the pending US jobs report fails to meet market expectations. With concerns over slowing global growth, renewed US-China trade tensions and Brexit uncertainty accelerating the flight to safety, Gold is fundamentally bullish. Focusing on the technical picture, an intraday breakout above $1445 could encourage a move higher towards $1450 and $1470, respectively. Brexit uncertainty has left construction firms with little confidence that business will pick up in the months ahead, according to the IHS Markit/Cips Construction PMI report: Construction companies meanwhile reported a sharp drop in their confidence regarding the year-ahead outlook for business activity. The latest reading was the lowest since November 2012. Survey respondents often cited Brexit uncertainty, the prospect of a General Election and delays to infrastructure work. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club, reminds us that this is the third straight month of contraction for the UK construction sector: The IHS Markit/Cips construction purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) has come in at 45.3. That is slightly higher than the June reading of 43.1, which was a 10-year low. However, it missed economist expectations for a reading of 46. A PMI figure below 50 shows the sector has contracted. European luxury stocks are weaker this morning, amid worries that China could retaliate against Trump\u2019s tariff threats. French and Swiss luxury brands including LVMH, Kering, Hermes, Moncler and Ferragamo are each down by around 2-3%. High-end Swiss stocks like Richemont and Swatch are down 3.4% and 5%, respectively. In the UK, Burberry is down nearly 3%. Connor Campbell, a financial analyst at SpreadEx, laments that even the by-election win for the Liberal Democrats in Wales wasn\u2019t enough to buoy the pound: You\u2019d think Trump\u2019s latest trade war cannon blast might take some of the spotlight off of sterling. Well, that wasn\u2019t the case. Even the Lib Dems victory in the Brecon and Radnorshire by-election, a win that reduces Boris Johnson\u2019s Commons majority to one, couldn\u2019t prevent the pound from another round of losses. All eyes have been on the pound in recent days, having slipped below $1.21 against the US dollar for the first time since since January 2017 yesterday. But sterling seems to have stabilised slightly, down around 0.06% versus the dollar at $1.2122. It\u2019s faring worse against the euro, down 0.2% at \u20ac1.09. Of the 10,000 businesses the Bank of England surveys across the country, three quarters are saying \u201cthey are ready as they can be\u201d for the EU divorce, while 10% say they are ready for Brexit. When those businesses are asked what they think will happen in a no deal scenario, Carney said most believe output will fall, jobs will be cut and investment will drop. The Bank of England boss stresses that is the view of businesses, not the central bank. \u201cWe do not have an official forecast of no deal,\u201d he reiterates. Carney has also highlighted that major industries including the automotive, food and chemicals, and transport sectors have held back investment in light of Brexit uncertainty: One of the reasons why the economy has slowed is that business investment is very, very weak. And it\u2019s unusually weak at this stage in an economic expansion, it\u2019s unusually weak given that there\u2019s not spare capacity, and that the financial sector is wide open. And the reason is because of uncertainty. They could borrow the money and their balance sheets are good...and part of the uncertainty is that many of these businesses know that they could end up making an investment that turns out to be stranded because the trading relationship fundamentally changes. Bank of England governor Mark Carney is speaking to the BBC\u2019s Today programme following yesterday\u2019s inflation report and the decision to keep interest rates on hold at 0.75%. He has said that while the UK is \u201cnot aiming for a no deal Brexit\u201d there is a \u201csignificant possibility that a deal will not be struck\u201d which is why preparations are being made. Carney said that UK\u2019s major banks and insurance companies are being asked whether they are ready for a worst case scenario like no deal. \u201cWe are absolutely confident\u201d that they are prepared, he says. More trade news is expected from the White House today. Trump\u2019s daily itinerary for Friday includes \u201can announcement on EU trade\u201d, which sounds a bit foreboding after the threats against China overnight. However, Bloomberg is reporting that the US president is set to unveil a deal to open the EU to more beef exports. It says American farmers will be entitled to around 80% or 35,000 metric tons of an annual EU quota on hormone-free beef over seven years. The London stock market has fallen into the red at the start of trading, with the FTSE 100 opening lower by 1.6% or 114 points to 7,463 points. France\u2019s Cac 40 opened lower by around 2.5% while Spain\u2019s IBEX dropped 1.6%. Italian markets have also taken a dive. The FTSE MIB is down more than 2.1% or 451 points to 21,111 points Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Global shares tumbled overnight in reacted to Donald Trump\u2019s plans to ramp up the US trade war with Beijing. In a fresh Twitter missive to his far-east counterparts, the US president said he would slap a 10% tariff on the $300bn worth of remaining Chinese goods not yet impacted by American border taxes, by September: Unsurprisingly, Wall Street stocks fell in reaction, sending the Dow Jones down 1% and the S&amp;P 500 down around 0.8% in overnight trading. Asian shares also took a hit. In Tokyo the Nikkei fell 2.1%, with Hong Kong and Shanghai also taking a spill. The Kospi was down 0.8% in Seoul while in Sydney the benchmark ASX200, which passed its pre-global financial crisis all-time high on Tuesday, fell 0.3%. European markets aren\u2019t expected to fare much better at the market open.

It\u2019s a given that long-term relationships need work and some things won\u2019t get resolved, but looking at why certain things wind us up, and others don\u2019t, may be helpful. How do the rest of the family feel about his anecdotes? Philpotts said that, in one study, \u201c69% of disagreements are unsolvable and marriages that work recognise this and focus on the important issues\u201d. For you, I recognise that this is an important issue, however petty it may seem to others. That\u2019s because its roots must hit on something pretty big in you. Philpotts asked you to look at what emotions surface when your husband does the \u201crecycled humour\u201d as opposed to the \u201cmore spontaneous humour\u201d. You may need to drill down to find out what those are. \u201cCould you ask him,\u201d suggested Philpotts, \u201cwhat he is getting out of repeating these stories? What does it mean for him? [Comfort? Ties to his family way of doing things?] And how does this compare with him being spontaneously witty?\u201d It may help you get perspective on it, but you need to be careful and ask this out of curiosity, rather than criticism. You clearly fear he is on a similar path to his brother, but they are different people. What scares you so much about your husband not having close friends? Do you think he overly relies on you? We often try to control others when we feel out of control ourselves. There was something in your longer letter that hinted, I thought, at possibly feeling overwhelmed and overly responsible within the family \u2013 might that be accurate? I asked Philpotts if there was something you could say to yourself when these moments of irritability occur \u2013 right in the heat of them \u2013 and she suggested you think: \u201cWhat do I need in this moment?\u201d The answer might surprise you. Is it a hug, recognition, a rest? I tried this myself in situations where I felt irked and what came up surprised me. Mine included: \u201cI need: understanding/to be listened to/a rest/someone to say, \u2018It\u2019s OK.\u2019\u201d But each of these reactions had very little to do with the actual thing that was annoying me; so instead of thinking about the irritation, shift the focus and see what comes up for you. If you need to talk about this with your husband, go easy \u2013 you\u2019re right to be wary of being controlling. We all repeat things and it\u2019s horrible to be made to feel self-conscious, as you recognise. \u2022 Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.com.

      "bodyText": "A century after emulating the British royals by removing vestiges of its German lineage in the wake of the first world war, the Belgian monarchy has reintroduced the shield of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, a former surname, to its coat of arms. The family name was changed in 1920 to van Belgi\u00eb, de Belgique or von Belgien (\u201cof Belgium\u201d) in the country\u2019s three official languages as a response to fierce anti-German sentiment. The German army had killed more than 6,000 Belgian citizens during its invasion and occupation in 1914, in what came to be known as the \u201dviol de la Belgique\u201d, or rape of Belgium. As well as ridding the Belgian monarchy of its German name \u2013 as did the British royal family, who replaced Saxe-Coburg-Gotha with Windsor in 1917 \u2013 Albert I removed the shield of his German ancestry from the royal coat of arms. But in what Belgian royal commentators described as a timely acknowledgement of the close ties between Belgium and Germany, through Nato and the EU, the ancestral shield has been reintroduced by Philippe, King of the Belgians. The decision in 2017 for only those most closely related to the king to take the van Belgi\u00eb surname, rather than Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, may also have been a factor in the move. Mark Van den Wijngaert, emeritus professor of contemporary history at the Catholic University Brussels, told De Standaard newspaper that the removal of the German name was understandable at the time. \u201cBut in the meantime we are 100 years further on and we live in close contact with Germany, we sit together with them in the European Union and Nato, and so on,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd although the family started to call themselves \u2018from Belgium\u2019, their origin is simply from [the former duchy of] Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, so that no longer needs to be hidden.\u201d Under the revised coat of arms, the proverb \u201cL\u2019union fait la force\u201d (unity makes strength), which until now was only in French, is also in Dutch and German. Van den Wijngaert said: \u201cThe innovations in the coat of arms of the royal house show that King Philippe does not stick to \u2013 sometimes outdated \u2013 traditions and that he wants to keep up with the times. \u201cThat the shield now also has an inscription in Dutch and German is entirely in line with what King Philippe said in his speech [on the national day], namely that he wants to be the king of the entire federation and of all Belgians.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>For the TV producer or the newsroom editor it must be, as they say, a no-brainer that the crimes of a billionaire convicted sex offender \u2013 and each new revelation about his behavior, most recently his plans to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/01/jeffrey-epstein-seed-human-race-report\">repopulate the world</a> with his own scientifically engineered offspring \u2013 is a grabbier story than the death of a Guatemalan child. There was never any doubt about which of these items got top billing when Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s initial arrest occurred around the same time as the child\u2019s bereaved mother testified before Congress. Epstein got the headlines and led the broadcasts, while the mother, Yazmin Ju\u00e1rez, was the sixth or seventh item into the program, the night I watched. Still, let\u2019s give the network some credit for allowing her to tell her story: for listening to her at all.</p> \n<p>Make no mistake. I\u2019d be glad to see the creepy, privileged Epstein go down. Like most people, I don\u2019t like the idea that the rich are above the law, though we hardly need Jeffrey Epstein to remind us that the US has parallel legal systems operating according to the race and income level of the accused. Who doesn\u2019t love a scandal? We can\u2019t help it, we\u2019re human. And each new chapter \u2013 now the news of the celebrated scientists he courted to advise him on his bizarre eugenics program \u2013 continues to seize and hold our attention.</p> \n<p>But on the <em>same day</em> he was arrested on sex trafficking charges, the day I couldn\u2019t look at my phone without <em>seeing Epstein\u2019s face</em>, I saw, on the evening news, a short clip from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/10/house-hearing-migrant-children-detention-facilities\">testimony</a> at a congressional hearing: Ju\u00e1rez described the death of her 19-month-old daughter, Mariee, after they were imprisoned by Ice at the border in a room she called \u201cthe Icebox\u201d \u2013 locked in with thirty other people, sleeping on the cold concrete floor. During her interview with Ice, Ju\u00e1rez was told by an official that this country was for Americans, that Trump was his president, that they could take her baby away from her and lock her up in jail.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"845fd886-c2ee-46a4-9fd9-d1f0a09429b4\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/37ihqCeqCFA?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Transferred to Texas\u2019s notorious Camp Dilley detention center, Mariee fell ill, and her illness failed to respond to the prescribed Tylenol and honey. Even after Mariee had lost 8% of her body weight, she was treated for an ear infection. After six weeks in the hospital, ultimately on a ventilator, Mariee died, \u201cslowly and painfully\u201d of a treatable viral lung infection. \u201cMy daughter is gone; the people who are in charge of running these facilities and caring for these little angels are not supposed to let these the things happen to them.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/10/house-hearing-migrant-children-detention-facilities\">Mother whose toddler died after Ice detention speaks out in emotional testimony</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Among the conclusions that the clearly moved Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez drew from Ju\u00e1rez\u2019s testimony is that what happened to Yasmin and her daughter in the detention center reflects a wider \u201ca culture of cruelty\u201d in these camps and in our treatment of migrants, in general. And these deaths continue to happen while we await new revelations about how vile and delusional Epstein was.</p> \n<p>What connects these two stories is that they are both about suffering and about the culture of cruelty, about cruel abuses of power. Both stories concern the abusive mistreatment of children.</p> \n<p>But there <em>is</em> one more connection, which is Donald Trump. Along with the agents of Ice, Trump has Mariee\u2019s blood on his hands. Trump is also a former friend of Epstein\u2019s. Their friendship soured, but Trump has been widely quoted as saying Epstein is a fun guy who shares his love of beautiful women, \u201csome of them on the young side\u201d.</p> \n<p>Some of them on the young side.</p> \n<p>To be alive at this moment is to be in a constant state of denial, ignoring all sorts of things, among them the fact that the president of the United States is an accused rapist and a man who thinks that the sex trafficking of girls \u201ca little on the young side\u201d is a joke. Locker-room stuff, people said, when he boasted about grabbing women\u2019s pussies. He continues as president, even as the list of sexual misconduct charges against him threatens to rival Bill Cosby\u2019s, and as other men are disgraced for much less serious offenses.</p> \n<p>I and many Americans are in a state of stunned disbelief that this is who we have become. A culture\u2019s values trickle from the top down, and what\u2019s trickling down from Trump and his oligarch friends is the idea that cold-blooded cruelty to the weak and defenseless is not only justified but energizing and exciting. A turn-on.</p> \n<p>When I hear the \u201cstrategic\u201d argument that we should wait and defeat Donald Trump at the ballot box in 2020, all I can think of is how long that time \u2013 the days and hours and weeks between now and October 2020 \u2013 will seem to the children in cages, the families in mourning, the parents looking for lost kids. We can\u2019t forget them for a moment, no matter how avidly we follow each new detail of the Epstein case \u2013 while Mariee is all but forgotten except by those who loved and continue to mourn her.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Francine Prose is a former president of PEN American Center and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.</p></li> \n</ul>",

      "bodyText": "For the TV producer or the newsroom editor it must be, as they say, a no-brainer that the crimes of a billionaire convicted sex offender \u2013 and each new revelation about his behavior, most recently his plans to repopulate the world with his own scientifically engineered offspring \u2013 is a grabbier story than the death of a Guatemalan child. There was never any doubt about which of these items got top billing when Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s initial arrest occurred around the same time as the child\u2019s bereaved mother testified before Congress. Epstein got the headlines and led the broadcasts, while the mother, Yazmin Ju\u00e1rez, was the sixth or seventh item into the program, the night I watched. Still, let\u2019s give the network some credit for allowing her to tell her story: for listening to her at all. Make no mistake. I\u2019d be glad to see the creepy, privileged Epstein go down. Like most people, I don\u2019t like the idea that the rich are above the law, though we hardly need Jeffrey Epstein to remind us that the US has parallel legal systems operating according to the race and income level of the accused. Who doesn\u2019t love a scandal? We can\u2019t help it, we\u2019re human. And each new chapter \u2013 now the news of the celebrated scientists he courted to advise him on his bizarre eugenics program \u2013 continues to seize and hold our attention. But on the same day he was arrested on sex trafficking charges, the day I couldn\u2019t look at my phone without seeing Epstein\u2019s face, I saw, on the evening news, a short clip from the testimony at a congressional hearing: Ju\u00e1rez described the death of her 19-month-old daughter, Mariee, after they were imprisoned by Ice at the border in a room she called \u201cthe Icebox\u201d \u2013 locked in with thirty other people, sleeping on the cold concrete floor. During her interview with Ice, Ju\u00e1rez was told by an official that this country was for Americans, that Trump was his president, that they could take her baby away from her and lock her up in jail. Transferred to Texas\u2019s notorious Camp Dilley detention center, Mariee fell ill, and her illness failed to respond to the prescribed Tylenol and honey. Even after Mariee had lost 8% of her body weight, she was treated for an ear infection. After six weeks in the hospital, ultimately on a ventilator, Mariee died, \u201cslowly and painfully\u201d of a treatable viral lung infection. \u201cMy daughter is gone; the people who are in charge of running these facilities and caring for these little angels are not supposed to let these the things happen to them.\u201d Among the conclusions that the clearly moved Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez drew from Ju\u00e1rez\u2019s testimony is that what happened to Yasmin and her daughter in the detention center reflects a wider \u201ca culture of cruelty\u201d in these camps and in our treatment of migrants, in general. And these deaths continue to happen while we await new revelations about how vile and delusional Epstein was. What connects these two stories is that they are both about suffering and about the culture of cruelty, about cruel abuses of power. Both stories concern the abusive mistreatment of children. But there is one more connection, which is Donald Trump. Along with the agents of Ice, Trump has Mariee\u2019s blood on his hands. Trump is also a former friend of Epstein\u2019s. Their friendship soured, but Trump has been widely quoted as saying Epstein is a fun guy who shares his love of beautiful women, \u201csome of them on the young side\u201d. Some of them on the young side. To be alive at this moment is to be in a constant state of denial, ignoring all sorts of things, among them the fact that the president of the United States is an accused rapist and a man who thinks that the sex trafficking of girls \u201ca little on the young side\u201d is a joke. Locker-room stuff, people said, when he boasted about grabbing women\u2019s pussies. He continues as president, even as the list of sexual misconduct charges against him threatens to rival Bill Cosby\u2019s, and as other men are disgraced for much less serious offenses. I and many Americans are in a state of stunned disbelief that this is who we have become. A culture\u2019s values trickle from the top down, and what\u2019s trickling down from Trump and his oligarch friends is the idea that cold-blooded cruelty to the weak and defenseless is not only justified but energizing and exciting. A turn-on. When I hear the \u201cstrategic\u201d argument that we should wait and defeat Donald Trump at the ballot box in 2020, all I can think of is how long that time \u2013 the days and hours and weeks between now and October 2020 \u2013 will seem to the children in cages, the families in mourning, the parents looking for lost kids. We can\u2019t forget them for a moment, no matter how avidly we follow each new detail of the Epstein case \u2013 while Mariee is all but forgotten except by those who loved and continue to mourn her.

      "body": "<p>\u2018The three big \u2018no\u2019s in Indian cinema are sexuality, religion and politics,\u201d says Anurag Kashyap. \u201cAnd in Sacred Games we address all three.\u201d The Netflix series, which Kashyap co-directed, takes viewers to places Bollywood rarely does. It could be seen as India\u2019s answer to Narcos: a dense, tense crime saga that closely tracks real-world history: political and police corruption, organised crime, religious tension, nuclear terrorism. The story switches between the present day, where a Sikh detective (Saif Ali Khan) gets wind of an imminent terrorist attack on Mumbai, and the 1980s, tracking the rise of a charismatic but ruthless gangster (played by Nawazuddin Siddiqui). There is blood, sex, and violence, not to mention a <a href=\"https://www.telegraphindia.com/entertainment/kukoo-calling/cid/1433168\">trailblazing transgender character</a>. \u201cYou cannot do that in mainstream cinema and have an audience,\u201d Kashyap says. \u201cIt\u2019s a given that movie-watching in India is a family experience, a community experience. Families didn\u2019t sit together to see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_Games_(TV_series)\">Sacred Games</a>.\u201d</p> <p>Kashyap is a maverick in Indian cinema. For 15 years, he has operated outside the commercial mainstream, writing, directing and producing provocative, relatively low-budget movies at a prodigious rate. But now Kashyap finds himself at the crest of a new wave of Indian content that could permanently alter the landscape. With 1.3 billion people and more than 500 million internet subscribers, not to mention flatlining growth in other territories, the streaming giants have been moving into India big time. Both Netflix and Amazon launched their services there in 2016, taking on larger local rivals such as the Disney-owned Hotstar. Amazon pledged to create 17 original Indian series; Netflix 16 original series <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/netflix-eyes-22-original-films-from-india-by-2020-end-eight-already-out-119052201377_1.html\">and 22 films</a>. Not only are these companies telling stories Bollywood can\u2019t, they are bringing them to audiences Bollywood can\u2019t reach. Sacred Games was a phenomenon in India, but the show was watched by twice as many people outside the country, according to Netflix.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5af99b658ff688a4cfcaefdb5649d563bfe979aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5af99b658ff688a4cfcaefdb5649d563bfe979aa/0_176_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sacred Games.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Blood, sex and violence ... Sacred Games.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ishika Mohan Motwane/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhat we managed with Sacred Games is to create a sense of time and place,\u201d Kashyap told me at June\u2019s <a href=\"http://londonindianfilmfestival.co.uk/\">London Indian </a><a href=\"http://londonindianfilmfestival.co.uk/\">film </a><a href=\"http://londonindianfilmfestival.co.uk/\">festival</a>. \u201cHindi cinema doesn\u2019t give you that context; they\u2019re stories set in la la land: it could be India, it could be Mexico, it could be anywhere. But through Sacred Games you also understand the country, and that, for me, is the hallmark of a great show.\u201d</p> <p>Kashyap\u2019s relationship with Netflix began when they acquired his celebrated 2013 movie <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/feb/21/gangs-of-wasseypur-review\">Gangs of Wasseypur</a> \u2013 a five-hour smalltown gangster epic in two parts. Netflix producer Erik Barmack reached out to Kashyap and his production partner Vikramaditya Motwane (who co-directs Sacred Games), and things moved along quickly. \u201cThey gave me a lot of freedom to work the way I wanted, to change the script, improvising, changing the cast. Normally that doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d he says. \u201cNetflix is like home. I can sit round a table and argue and discuss and fight about the content I\u2019m trying to do, but after all the conflict, they actually listen to you.\u201d He is already developing other projects with the company.</p> <p>Sacred Games is not the only boundary-pushing Indian show Netflix has released. There is supernatural horror <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7MeqIDM3X4\">Ghoul</a>, set in a detention facility in a near-future India under martial law due to sectarian violence. There is cricketing drama <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_Day_(TV_series)\">Selection Day</a>, based on the book by Booker prize-winner Aravind Adiga, and directed by British-Indian Udayan Prasad. On a very different tack was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lust_Stories\">Lust Stories</a>, an anthology of short films by four directors (including Kashyap), all focusing on female sexuality.

He was preparing Delhi Crime as a feature until he met former HBO co-head of drama David Levine, who suggested he turn it into a series. This was three years before Netflix or Amazon came to India, so it was a risky movie. Levine referred him to The Wire to learn the ropes, he says, but he was equally influenced by movies such as The French Connection.</p> <p>Mehta\u2019s earlier, India-set films, Amal and <a href=\"https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/siddharth-2014\">Siddharth</a>, played at festivals and garnered critical praise, but the reaction to Delhi Crime was of a different order, he says. \u201cI\u2019ve never had anything that, once it was released, was essentially within a few days seen by everyone I\u2019d ever known around the world, in every language.\u201d A second season of Delhi Crime is now in the works, with the same cast working on a different case. Mehta is executive producing it, as well as developing new long-form ideas of his own. \u201cBefore I used to say, if it\u2019s going to be a series, it really really needs to be justified, which is still true. But now it\u2019s more the other way round, where I\u2019m like, if it\u2019s a <em>film</em> it\u2019s really got to be justified. My ambition has now increased. I\u2019m starting to conceive of stories that are 10, 15, 20 hours long.\u201d</p> <p>Even in cinemas, streaming giants are exerting an influence on Indian cinema, it seems. Out in the UK this month is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/26/photograph-review-mumbai-romance-ritesh-batra\">Photograph</a>, the latest movie from director Ritesh Batra, who scored a global hit with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/apr/13/lunchbox-bollywood-review-banked-emotions\">The Lunchbox</a>, a decorous, gastronomic romance set in Mumbai. Photograph operates in a similar vein, bringing together a lowly Mumbai portrait photographer (Siddiqui again) and one of his subjects (wealthier student Sanya Malhotra) whom he convinces to pose as his fiancee to get his grandmother off his back. Like The Lunchbox (whose co-producer, incidentally, was Kashyap), and unlike the harder-hitting Netflix fare, Photograph is a gentle, almost old-fashioned tale of courtship, albeit in a down-to-earth Mumbai setting. It is being released in the UK by Curzon but in the US, India and Japan it is distributed by Amazon Studios, who became involved in the project at an early stage.</p> <p>Between The Lunchbox and Photograph, Batra made two films in English: British drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/apr/06/the-sense-of-an-ending-review-jim-broadbent-julian-barnes\">The Sense of an Ending</a>, adapted from the Julian Barnes novel. Then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/01/our-souls-at-night-review-robert-redford-jane-fonda-romance-kent-haruf\">Our Souls </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/01/our-souls-at-night-review-robert-redford-jane-fonda-romance-kent-haruf\">at Night</a>, another tender romance, starring Robert Redford and Jane Fonda. Redford called him up and asked him to direct it, having seen The Lunchbox. Batra, who is based in New York, seems unfazed by the experience: \u201cRobert is super-collaborative, so is Jane. They were up for anything. We would do 18 takes sometimes.\u201d</p> <p>Our Souls at Night was a Netflix production. It almost goes without saying that Batra is now preparing his own long-form web series. All he will reveal is that it is \u201cbased on a great Indian novel\u201d. He cannot say more, although last year Netflix also announced it is <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2018/11/midnights-children-vishal-bhardwaj-showrunner-netflix-series-based-on-salman-rushdie-novel-1202510055/\">making its own version</a> of Salman Rushdie\u2019s Midnight\u2019s Children.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very appreciative of the streamers and their influence on cinema culture,\u201d Batra says. Indian cinema is something of a closed shop. Even getting The Lunchbox released there was a challenge (although it eventually played in cinemas for nine months). \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to get access to cinemas for different kinds of movies. Once something is working you cannot convince people to give the audience variety or choice, you can just keep doing more of the same, but what the streamers will hopefully do is broaden audiences\u2019 palette, so they start demanding different fare in cinemas too. That should be good for the kind of movies that I and other film-makers want to make in India.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwOGIlpPqek\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LwOGIlpPqek?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>All the same, bigger Bollywood players are now getting in on the digital game. Legendary actor Shah Rukh Khan, for example, is producing two new shows for Netflix, a spy thriller and a zombie drama. Screen goddess Madhuri Dixit also produced her own Netflix film, 15 August. Meanwhile, Kabir Khan, who has directed some of the country\u2019s biggest hits, is finishing off an epic series for Amazon on nationalist Subhas Chandra Bose, leader of the wartime Indian National Army. And Oscar-winning British film-maker Asif Kapadia is executive-producing The Last Hour, a supernatural thriller series, for Amazon. Netflix also has plenty more to come, including an adaptation of bestseller Cobalt Blue, about a brother and sister who fall for the same man. There are also second series of Delhi Crime, Selection Day and, most anticipated of all, Sacred Games, in mid-August. The first season, which only covered about a third of Vikram Chandra\u2019s source novel, ended on a cliffhanger. The second is set to be even higher profile, inside and outside India.</p> <p>Could this be the beginning of a brain-drain in Indian cinema? Could the streaming services start to erode Bollywood? Just as House of Cards marked the start of an exodus from Hollywood to digital platforms, so shows such as Sacred Games could augur the same for India. There is something to lose here. For all its inaccessibility, Bollywood is really the only substantial national cinema that has not been co-opted by the US and other foreign players. As Kashyap puts it: \u201cOur biggest strength is our biggest weakness: that we do not need to sell a single ticket to a non-Indian to sustain ourselves.\u201d It doesn\u2019t have to be a zero-sum game, but the streaming companies have created an extra platform for more outward-facing Indian film-makers such as Kashyap, Mehta and Batra. Having been outsiders, they now find themselves in a position of unprecedented power and influence. The game has changed.</p> <p>\u2022 Photograph is released on 2 August and series two of Sacred Games on 15 August. </p>",

      "bodyText": "\u2018The three big \u2018no\u2019s in Indian cinema are sexuality, religion and politics,\u201d says Anurag Kashyap. \u201cAnd in Sacred Games we address all three.\u201d The Netflix series, which Kashyap co-directed, takes viewers to places Bollywood rarely does. It could be seen as India\u2019s answer to Narcos: a dense, tense crime saga that closely tracks real-world history: political and police corruption, organised crime, religious tension, nuclear terrorism. The story switches between the present day, where a Sikh detective (Saif Ali Khan) gets wind of an imminent terrorist attack on Mumbai, and the 1980s, tracking the rise of a charismatic but ruthless gangster (played by Nawazuddin Siddiqui). There is blood, sex, and violence, not to mention a trailblazing transgender character. \u201cYou cannot do that in mainstream cinema and have an audience,\u201d Kashyap says. \u201cIt\u2019s a given that movie-watching in India is a family experience, a community experience. Families didn\u2019t sit together to see Sacred Games.\u201d Kashyap is a maverick in Indian cinema. For 15 years, he has operated outside the commercial mainstream, writing, directing and producing provocative, relatively low-budget movies at a prodigious rate. But now Kashyap finds himself at the crest of a new wave of Indian content that could permanently alter the landscape. With 1.3 billion people and more than 500 million internet subscribers, not to mention flatlining growth in other territories, the streaming giants have been moving into India big time. Both Netflix and Amazon launched their services there in 2016, taking on larger local rivals such as the Disney-owned Hotstar. Amazon pledged to create 17 original Indian series; Netflix 16 original series and 22 films. Not only are these companies telling stories Bollywood can\u2019t, they are bringing them to audiences Bollywood can\u2019t reach. Sacred Games was a phenomenon in India, but the show was watched by twice as many people outside the country, according to Netflix. \u201cWhat we managed with Sacred Games is to create a sense of time and place,\u201d Kashyap told me at June\u2019s London Indian film festival. \u201cHindi cinema doesn\u2019t give you that context; they\u2019re stories set in la la land: it could be India, it could be Mexico, it could be anywhere. But through Sacred Games you also understand the country, and that, for me, is the hallmark of a great show.\u201d Kashyap\u2019s relationship with Netflix began when they acquired his celebrated 2013 movie Gangs of Wasseypur \u2013 a five-hour smalltown gangster epic in two parts. Netflix producer Erik Barmack reached out to Kashyap and his production partner Vikramaditya Motwane (who co-directs Sacred Games), and things moved along quickly. \u201cThey gave me a lot of freedom to work the way I wanted, to change the script, improvising, changing the cast. Normally that doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d he says. \u201cNetflix is like home. I can sit round a table and argue and discuss and fight about the content I\u2019m trying to do, but after all the conflict, they actually listen to you.\u201d He is already developing other projects with the company. Sacred Games is not the only boundary-pushing Indian show Netflix has released. There is supernatural horror Ghoul, set in a detention facility in a near-future India under martial law due to sectarian violence. There is cricketing drama Selection Day, based on the book by Booker prize-winner Aravind Adiga, and directed by British-Indian Udayan Prasad. On a very different tack was Lust Stories, an anthology of short films by four directors (including Kashyap), all focusing on female sexuality. In one of them, a married school teacher (Radhika Apte, who also stars in Sacred Games and Ghoul) has an affair with a pupil. In another, an unsatisfied bride-to-be borrows her friend\u2019s bullet vibrator \u2013 cue comedy mix-ups with the TV remote. Amazon has also put out provocative content, such as Mirzapur, a crime saga infused with sex and violence, that would not get past the cinema censors. At the other end of the spectrum was this year\u2019s Delhi Crime, based on the horrific gang rape, torture and murder of Jyoti Singh on a Delhi bus in 2012. The incident provoked an international outrage and mass protests across India, but Delhi Crime focuses on the manhunt for the six perpetrators, based on the real-life case files. The investigation is spearheaded by a female deputy police commissioner. Having seen the victim\u2019s condition in hospital on the first night, she personally takes charge of the case, and barely sleeps or goes home until she has caught the men \u2013 which took just six days.

What kind of fruit? Blackcurrant or lemon? Raspberry or plum? It\u2019s basically the wine world\u2019s way of saying: \u201cThis bottle is nice.\u201d</p> <p>Mind you, it\u2019s not just wine: fruit is added to practically everything these days \u2013 beer, cider, vodka, tonic, gin \u2026 Gin, <em>of course</em>. Not a week goes past without the launch of a new fruit gin, many of which have lost sight of the other botanicals \u2013 the new <strong><a href=\"http://www.greenallsgin.com/drink/blueberry/\" title=\"\">Greenall\u2019s Blueberry Gin</a></strong> \u201cinfused with sweet natural blueberries\u201d (as opposed to what, exactly?) being a classic example.

Nothing new there, of course. It\u2019s just that these bottles are more enticing \u2013 and more expensive \u2013 than they ever were. Even water, it seems, has to be flavoured and, of course, sweetened: <strong><a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&amp;q=volvic+cherry\" title=\"\">Volvic Cherry</a></strong>, for example, has 5.7g sugar in a serving. And watch out for pre-mix drinks that are invariably sweeter than you\u2019d think. I really like Edinburgh gin as a rule, but their <strong><a href=\"https://www.edinburghgin.com/our-gins/rhubarb-and-ginger-gin-liqueur\" title=\"\">Rhubarb &amp; Ginger</a></strong> is horrid.</p> <p>Even if you\u2019re quietly going about your business trying to catch a train, there\u2019s no escape. At my local station the other day, they were handing out free chilled fruit teas called <strong>Fuze</strong>, which turned out to be made by \u2013 who else? \u2013 Coca-Cola. Each 150ml can of the mango and camomile brew contains 6.5g sugar, which is more than a teaspoon. Again, you could easily make your own cheaper, less sweet alternative.</p> <p>Not having much of a sweet tooth, I like my fruit with a bit of balancing sharpness, so given the chance, I go for kombuchas and sour beers.

      "bodyText": "Judging by the frequency with which it\u2019s used on drinks labels, \u201cfruity\u201d must be one of the favourite descriptors out there, despite the fact that it\u2019s so vague as to be almost meaningless. What kind of fruit? Blackcurrant or lemon? Raspberry or plum? It\u2019s basically the wine world\u2019s way of saying: \u201cThis bottle is nice.\u201d Mind you, it\u2019s not just wine: fruit is added to practically everything these days \u2013 beer, cider, vodka, tonic, gin \u2026 Gin, of course. Not a week goes past without the launch of a new fruit gin, many of which have lost sight of the other botanicals \u2013 the new Greenall\u2019s Blueberry Gin \u201cinfused with sweet natural blueberries\u201d (as opposed to what, exactly?) being a classic example. It\u2019s much better and cheaper to do what my pal Chris does at his pub, The Butlers Arms in Sutton Coldfield, and infuse your own. These days, even the display fridge in the average cafe is stuffed with enough fruit drinks to make me come over all grumpy-old-woman about the unnecessary added calories and the fact that young tastebuds are being desensitised to sugar. Nothing new there, of course. It\u2019s just that these bottles are more enticing \u2013 and more expensive \u2013 than they ever were. Even water, it seems, has to be flavoured and, of course, sweetened: Volvic Cherry, for example, has 5.7g sugar in a serving. And watch out for pre-mix drinks that are invariably sweeter than you\u2019d think. I really like Edinburgh gin as a rule, but their Rhubarb &amp; Ginger is horrid. Even if you\u2019re quietly going about your business trying to catch a train, there\u2019s no escape. At my local station the other day, they were handing out free chilled fruit teas called Fuze, which turned out to be made by \u2013 who else? \u2013 Coca-Cola. Each 150ml can of the mango and camomile brew contains 6.5g sugar, which is more than a teaspoon. Again, you could easily make your own cheaper, less sweet alternative. Not having much of a sweet tooth, I like my fruit with a bit of balancing sharpness, so given the chance, I go for kombuchas and sour beers. Try the Envoy Fruit Sour Pale (\u00a33.10 beermerchants.com, 4%) from a splendid collaboration between 12 British and European brewers called the Citizens of Everywhere Project. This one was made by the Gipsy Hill Brewing Company in south London and Denmark\u2019s To \u00d8l, and is infused with peaches and nectarines. \u201cGoes well with freedom of movement,\u201d they cheekily put on the back of the can. Nigel Farage, you should try it. Four fruity drinks that aren\u2019t too sickly sweet Melonade \u00a316.45 The Whisky Exchange, 12% (70cl). Don\u2019t be put off by the name: this French aperitif made from melon de Cavaillon is ridiculously delicious. Serve over ice. Black Cow Vodka &amp; English Strawberries \u00a321.95 31dover.com, \u00a328 selected Sainsbury\u2019s, 37.5% (70cl). The perfect summer riff on this innovative Dorset milk vodka.

It is not clear that any European country would be willing to allow land-based missiles to be deployed on its soil; one country, Poland, has insisted there would have to be unanimous Nato support for their deployment, which is unlikely. Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, criticised Trump in a tweet on Friday: \u201cPresident Trump walking away from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty is yet another destructive decision that makes the world less safe. This reckless act will heighten the threat of a nuclear arms race.\u201d The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) said it had handed in a letter to Downing Street asking Boris Johnson \u201cto guarantee that it will refuse to host intermediate range missiles if it is asked to do so by the US administration\u201d. Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, announced Washington\u2019s formal withdrawal in a prepared statement at a regional forum in Bangkok, minutes after Russia pronounced the treaty to be \u201cdead\u201d. Both sides had signalled their intention to pull out of the treaty for months, trading accusations of breaking the terms of the deal. \u201cRussia is solely responsible for the treaty\u2019s demise,\u201d Pompeo said in a statement issued at an Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) foreign ministers\u2019 meeting. The INF deal was seen as one of two key arms deals between Russia and the US \u2013 the other being the New Start treaty, which keeps the nuclear arsenals of both countries well below their cold war peak. That deal expires in 2021 and there appears to be little political will from Moscow or Washington to renew it. China has already rebuffed calls from the US to join the New Start treaty.",

She had been carrying out research in the remote area of Anjajavy on the island off Africa\u2019s east coast.</p> <p>Local police say she fell despite the desperate efforts of the only other passenger and the pilot to keep her inside the plane.</p> <p>The body of the student, from Milton Keynes, who was studying natural sciences at Cambridge University, has not yet been recovered.</p> <p>Her uncle said she had become sick during her time in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/madagascar\">Madagascar,</a> possibly due to prescription medicine. Police are investigating her possible use of an anti-malaria drug, reports have claimed.</p> <p>\u201cShe had taken ill after being there for a few days and when she spoke to her mother on the phone two days before the accident she was mumbling and sounded pretty incoherent,\u201d Lester Riley, her mother\u2019s brother, told <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7311633/Alana-Cutland-hallucinating-prescription-drugs-plunged-death-Madagascar.html\">Mail Online</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWe think she had suffered a severe reaction to some drugs but not the anti-malaria ones because she had taken those on her trip last year to China without any side-effects.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cWhat happened, the family believe, was a tragic accident, not a suicide, and we are utterly heartbroken. She was hallucinating, she was unwell, something had made her ill, it must have been a reaction to medication.\u201d</p> <p>The second-year student had reportedly suffered \u201cparanoia attacks\u201d while on the research trip, during which she was seeking to discover more about a rare species of crab. She had been in regular contact with her mother, Alison, who works at Cranfield University near Milton Keynes, and her father Neil, an environmental engineer, who had reportedly encouraged her to cut short her six-week trip and come home.</p> <p>Police photographs recreating the incident appear to show the pilot and the second passenger, Ruth Johnson, 51, a friend of Cutland\u2019s, grasping hold of the student\u2019s leg. She is reported to have fallen to her death after a tense struggle to free herself.</p> <p>The plane\u2019s pilot, Mahefa Tahina Rantoanina, said Cutland had a headache when she boarded and stayed silent during the flight, which was said to be taking her to a hospital so she could be declared fit to fly back to the UK.</p> <p>\u201cBut for the whole time Alana did not say a word \u2013 she just struggled with us,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/9636749/plane-death-plunge-girl-alana-cutland-pilot/\">Rantoanina told the Sun.</a> \u201cI have no idea why she opened the door but she did. She opened the door and she jumped.

      "bodyText": "Police in Madagascar are investigating whether a British student who died after falling from a light plane deliberately opened the doors after suffering a severe reaction to medication. Alana Cutland, 19, who has been described by her family as a \u201cbright, independent young woman\u201d, fell from the two-door Cessna C168 on 25 July. She had been carrying out research in the remote area of Anjajavy on the island off Africa\u2019s east coast. Local police say she fell despite the desperate efforts of the only other passenger and the pilot to keep her inside the plane. The body of the student, from Milton Keynes, who was studying natural sciences at Cambridge University, has not yet been recovered. Her uncle said she had become sick during her time in Madagascar, possibly due to prescription medicine. Police are investigating her possible use of an anti-malaria drug, reports have claimed. \u201cShe had taken ill after being there for a few days and when she spoke to her mother on the phone two days before the accident she was mumbling and sounded pretty incoherent,\u201d Lester Riley, her mother\u2019s brother, told Mail Online. \u201cWe think she had suffered a severe reaction to some drugs but not the anti-malaria ones because she had taken those on her trip last year to China without any side-effects.\u201d He added: \u201cWhat happened, the family believe, was a tragic accident, not a suicide, and we are utterly heartbroken. She was hallucinating, she was unwell, something had made her ill, it must have been a reaction to medication.\u201d The second-year student had reportedly suffered \u201cparanoia attacks\u201d while on the research trip, during which she was seeking to discover more about a rare species of crab. She had been in regular contact with her mother, Alison, who works at Cranfield University near Milton Keynes, and her father Neil, an environmental engineer, who had reportedly encouraged her to cut short her six-week trip and come home. Police photographs recreating the incident appear to show the pilot and the second passenger, Ruth Johnson, 51, a friend of Cutland\u2019s, grasping hold of the student\u2019s leg. She is reported to have fallen to her death after a tense struggle to free herself. The plane\u2019s pilot, Mahefa Tahina Rantoanina, said Cutland had a headache when she boarded and stayed silent during the flight, which was said to be taking her to a hospital so she could be declared fit to fly back to the UK. \u201cBut for the whole time Alana did not say a word \u2013 she just struggled with us,\u201d Rantoanina told the Sun. \u201cI have no idea why she opened the door but she did. She opened the door and she jumped. The door did not open itself.\u201d Local police chief Sinola Nomenjahary said: \u201cThe Cessna C168 aircraft was taking off from Anjajavy with three people aboard, including Johnson, Alana and the pilot. After 10 minutes of flight, Alana undid her seatbelt and unlocked the right door of the plane and tried to get out. \u201cMs Johnson fought for five minutes trying to hold her, but when she was exhausted and out of breath she let go. Alana then intentionally fell from an aircraft at 1,130 metres above sea level.\u201d In a statement released through the Foreign Office, her family paid tribute to Cutland, saying she \u201cgrasped every opportunity that was offered to her with enthusiasm and a sense of adventure\u201d. It added: \u201cWe are heartbroken at the loss of our wonderful, beautiful daughter, who lit up every room she walk into, and made people smile just by being there.\u201d Some antimalarial drugs have been associated with potentially severe psychological side-effects in some users, although her family appear to suggest any reaction may have been linked to a different prescription medicine.",

That ambitious claim would have been dead in the water without Jane Dodds\u2019 win on Thursday.</p> <p>This widely anticipated result should do nothing to lessen the Lib Dems\u2019 achievement. Brecon and Radnorshire was a target seat; the Lib Dems have now won <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brecon_and_Radnorshire_(UK_Parliament_constituency)\" title=\"\">seven of the last 10 parliamentary contests</a> there, as well as holding the Welsh assembly seat with the same boundaries. But Chris Davies had won the seat by a thumping 8,000 majority for the Conservatives as recently as 2017, which was otherwise generally a bad election for the Tories in Wales. Moreover, the area voted to leave the EU and the Lib Dems are an explicitly remain party.

His local party nevertheless <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-48736879\" title=\"\">reselected</a> him for this contest. Though he was well known, he was clearly also damaged goods.

Both the Lib Dem victory and its relative narrowness seem to vindicate that approach, and there will sensibly be similar pressures now in other elections. However, the success of the pact should not be overstated. The Greens did not stand in Brecon and Radnorshire in 2017, and Plaid Cymru took only just over a thousand votes. In addition, the Lib Dems <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/29/lib-dems-quiet-bollocks-to-brexit-brecon-and-radnorshire-byelection\" title=\"\">did not highlight Brexit</a> in the campaign, preferring to run on local issues. Some caution is thus needed before claiming the result as a full-throated remain triumph. But the Lib Dem <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/02/jo-swinson-lib-dems-winning-on-the-up-byelection-victory\" title=\"\">recovery</a> continues, and a prospective byelection in Nick Clegg\u2019s old seat of Sheffield Hallam may give it further momentum.</p> <p>It is clear, however, that many Labour voters also helped to send Ms Dodds to Westminster. It bears repeating that until 1979 this was a Labour seat. In the 1985 byelection, Labour finished a very close second. Even in 2015 and 2017, Labour\u2019s vote share was still in the mid-teens. But on Thursday, Labour was down 12 points to 5.3%. The Lib Dem vote, by contrast, rose by 14.

The message for both the leave-supporting Jeremy Corbyn and for remain-supporting Welsh Labour is very stark.</p> <p>Perversely, the Conservatives are likely to take some comfort from this byelection. Mr Davies was not blown away. Their vote, though down by nine points, held up far better than when the Liberals won the 1985 byelection. Most Tory defectors this time seem to have gone to the Brexit party, but with only 11% support, this byelection was no triumph for the Faragistes and, in contrast to the European elections, the bulk of the leave vote stayed with the Tories.</p> <p>Ultimately, though, the Tories have lost votes, lost another seat, their Commons majority is even more razor-thin, and any Johnson bounce \u2013 which is unlikely to get bigger \u2013 has been modest. The fanciful idea that the new prime minister is an election winner remains dubious and unproved. Above all, there is now one more vote at Westminster against no-deal.

It clearly made a difference, giving Tories something positive to vote for and, more importantly in a 52:48 per cent Brexit split constituency, he had a renewed focus on taking the UK out of the EU on October 31. The Conservatives returned in this by-election to the party of leave and therefore Brexit, in a successful strategy to squeeze the Brexit Party vote. Boris becoming Prime Minister even for just over a week but with a new Brexit delivery agenda, injected an element of uncertainty into proceedings right up to the announcement of the result. In just over a week Boris moved his party from a position of no hope to coming close to victory.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d43cf138f08c7e177d43263\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-02T05:50:44.028Z\">6.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A reminder from the Guardian\u2019s <strong>Hannah Jane Parkinson </strong>about the circumstances that led to yesterday\u2019s byelection.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ladyhaja/status/1157154043594018817\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">it will never not be funny that Chris Davies, after being found guilty of expenses fraud and voted out by circa 20% of his constituents on petition, chose to stand again. <a href=\"https://t.co/2TdeRW5qfK\">https://t.co/2TdeRW5qfK</a></p>\u2014 Hannah Jane Parkinson (@ladyhaja) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ladyhaja/status/1157154043594018817?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 2, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d43ccd18f084f687f34f25b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-02T05:43:07.442Z\">6.43am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In case you missed it yesterday,<strong> Sonia Sodha</strong><strong>\u2019s </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/01/no-deal-preparations-britain-boris-johnson-eu\">comment piece</a> on the government\u2019s announcement of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/31/labour-attacks-appalling-waste-as-johnson-adds-2bn-no-deal-brexit-fund\">\u00a32.1bn for no-deal planning</a> is well worth a read.

      "bodyText": "Jo Swinson has declared the Liberal Democrats are \u201cwinning and on the up\u201d after reducing Boris Johnson\u2019s majority to one by taking a seat off the Conservatives in the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection. The Lib Dems won 13,826 votes with the Tories taking 12,401, a margin of 1,425 that overturned the Tories\u2019 previous majority of more than 8,000. Veteran MP Frank Field has announced that he will be standing as an independent in the next election. Field resigned the Labour whip after 39 years as the party\u2019s MP in Birkenhead last August, following a vote of no confidence from constituency members. He will run as a \u201cBirkenhead Social Justice\u201d candidate. Here is a quick roundup of his career to date. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has been accused of \u201cmisleading the public\u201d over no-deal Brexit and bringing the post of Foreign Secretary \u201cinto disrepute\u201d. Labour former Foreign Office minister Ben Bradshaw has written to Raab calling on him to apologise for claiming that the prospect of a no-deal exit from the European Union was \u201cwidely discussed and considered a realistic prospect during the 2016 EU referendum\u201d. Earlier this week the Guardian looked at what exactly had been said during the referendum campaign \u2013 Sean Kemp, a former Lib Dem head of media and Downing Street special adviser, has written for the Guardian cautioning against taking the result in Brecon and Radnorshire for grated. I don\u2019t know what god Lib Dem HQ was praying to in order to get a contest against a Conservative candidate who had just lost a recall petition after admitting fiddling his expenses, but I\u2019d suggest they build it a bigger shrine. Throw in other remain parties not standing and we shouldn\u2019t pretend that anything other than a Lib Dem victory here would have been a shock. But if there\u2019s a danger in over-interpreting one result, there\u2019s also a risk that the current relative good fortune being enjoyed by the Lib Dems is taken for granted. Received wisdom now appears to be that with a strong remain message and the Labour and Conservative parties apparently vacating the centre ground, everything is now theirs for the taking \u2013 and that it was always thus. Yet it\u2019s worth remembering that six months ago the very same received wisdom was that the party was possibly doomed. Jon Henley, the Guardian\u2019s Europe correspondent, has compiled this roundup of opinions on our new prime minister from politicians on the continent. \u201cLike many people, I was easily charmed by his demeanour, his self-confidence, his intelligence,\u201d said Han ten Broeke, a former Dutch MP specialising in EU affairs. \u201cHe\u2019s a pleasure to listen to. I have a soft spot for Britain, and Boris was one reason why.\u201d Ten Broeke has since revised his opinion. \u201cThe charm, the intellect, the confidence \u2013 it all now looks a lot like over-confidence,\u201d he said. \u201cA promise of simple solutions to complex problems. And it could have disastrous consequences.\u201d Field has published 10 immediate priorities for Birkenhead, which include eliminating child poverty and youth unemployment. He said he was working on a manifesto, shaped by the views of constituents, in preparation for a snap general election. Frank Field has announced that he will stand at next general election as a \u201cBirkenhead Social Justice\u201d candidate. He was a Labour MP for 39 years before resigning the party whip last August. Field said in a statement: It is a privilege to serve as Birkenhead\u2019s MP \u2013 as it has been every day for the past 40 years. It is ultimately a sovereign decision for the people of the town to decide who they wish to represent them in the House of Commons. I will be standing again as a candidate at the next election with the aim of doing what I have done for 40 years: always putting the interests of our town and our country first while championing the views and interests of the underdogs in our society. While we\u2019re waiting for the Frank Field announcement (see here), here\u2019s a bit of a recap \u2013 77-year-old Field has been MP for Birkenhead since 1979. While he was briefly minister for welfare reform in Tony Blair\u2019s government (May 1997 til July 1998 ), he resigned following disagreements with the then social security secretary Harriet Harman and returned to the back benches where he continued to be critical of the government. He is considered to be on the right of the party and in 2010 David Cameron made him his poverty tsar. Field was elected chair of the work and pensions select committee in 2015, where he has been a fierce critic of universal credit. In August 2018 he resigned the Labour party whip, citing anti-semitism in the party, after losing a vote of no confidence by members in his constituency. He subsequently described himself as an \u201cindependent Labour MP\u201d. Field is a eurosceptic and sided with Theresa May\u2019s government in numerous Brexit votes. Jane Dodds echoed the warning of the first minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, that these were dangerous times for the union. She said: \u201cThe Liberal Democrats are a party that want to stay as part of the United Kingdom. We want to stay in Europe. We see that as healthy for our communities. We have to stay in Europe and we have to stay in this bigger team.\u201d Turning to the farming, a key issue during the by-election campaign, she said: \u201cOctober, November and December are peak times to sell Welsh lamb. There are two issues for farmers \u2013 firstly, how are they going to cope with 40% tariffs on their lamb exports. The second is mental health. Farming is the profession with the highest suicide rate. These are real concerns.\u201d She called for Boris Johnson to return to Wales and have proper discussions with farmers. \u201cI want him to come and have really robust discussion with our farmers here.\u201d Asked if there will be constituencies where the Lib Dems will not stand at the next general election to clear the way for Plaid Cymru or the Greens, she said: \u201cWe\u2019ll certainly be having those discussions. It\u2019s too early to say at the moment. We want to reach out across political divides to find ways of working together. I will be looking for opportunities for that to happen.\u201d She rejected the idea that it was awkward representing a constituency that voted to leave the EU. \u201cI\u2019m here for everybody whether they voted for remain or Brexit,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were always up front about being the party of remain.\u201d Frank Field, the pro-Brexit former Labour minister who now sits as an independent MP is due to make an announcement \u201con his political future\u201d in the next hour. He will make a statement at Birkenhead Town Hall at noon followed by a question and answer session. Jo Swinson has said the byelection result could pave the way for more cross-party cooperation between pro-remain parties. She said: \u201cWe achieved a 12% swing overturning a majority of 8,000 in a seat that voted to leave the European Union. This is a stunning victory. Of course I am appreciative of Plaid and the Greens taking the step they did.\u201d Asked if this \u201cremain alliance\u201d would continue, she said: \u201cAbsolutely. In most constituencies across the country it will be the Liberal Democrats that are the strongest party of remain but we recognise the value in co-operating with others for that wider national goal to protect our country\u2019s future. I think this may well be a feature of future elections. We need to be grown up about that. Grown up co-operation across parties with the national interest will continue.\u201d Swinson also rejected the idea that Dodds had deliberately not talked much about Brexit during the campaign. She said: \u201cI absolutely heard her talking about stopping a no-deal Brexit. Farmers in this area talked to her about their concerns when we\u2019re looking at 40% tariffs on lamb exports.\u201d The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has been accused of \u201cmisleading the public\u201d over no-deal Brexit and bringing the post of Foreign Secretary \u201cinto disrepute\u201d. Labour former Foreign Office minister Ben Bradshaw has written to Raab calling on him to apologise for remarks on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme this week. He said the foreign secretary had claimed the prospect of a no-deal exit from the European Union was \u201cwidely discussed and considered a realistic prospect during the 2016 EU referendum\u201d. Bradshaw said the claim there is a mandate for a no-deal Brexit is \u201cdeeply dishonest and demeans the office of foreign secretary\u201d. In the letter, Bradshaw told Raab: \u201cYour pronouncements since taking the job just a few days ago risk bringing this great office of state into disrepute. I was astonished to hear you claim on the BBC\u2019s Today programme on Monday 29 July that the prospect of a no-deal exit from the European Union was widely discussed and considered a realistic prospect during the 2016 EU referendum. You must know this is simply not true. \u201cThere appears to be no evidence at all of you ever suggesting that leaving the EU without a deal was a likely or possible outcome. Indeed, whenever the question was put to you, you suggested the opposite - you claimed that a new, better deal would be negotiated with the EU if people voted to leave. \u201cYou said the UK would of course retain a strong trading relationship with Europe and would likely get a bespoke deal, and stated, \u2018the idea that Britain would be apocalyptically off the cliff edge if we left the EU is silly\u2019. \u201cThis is not a subject for debate, it is a matter of public record. \u201cFor you to now try and claim a democratic mandate for no deal, despite failing to discuss the possibility of such an outcome during the referendum, is deeply dishonest and demeans the office of foreign secretary.\u201d Bradshaw called on Raab to \u201capologise for misleading the public\u201d and to \u201cagree there is no mandate for no deal\u201d. The BBC\u2019s Reality Check team found no mention of leaving the EU without a deal in the six months before the referendum from Raab, Vote Leave or Michael Gove. Chris Bryant, the Labour MP for the Welsh seat of Rhondda, claimed Labour\u2019s vague stance on Brexit had damaged the party in the byelection. Speaking to the BBC\u2019s Victoria Derbyshire programme he said: Some of us have been saying for quite some time that one of the problems about trying to be all things to men and women is that nobody ends up liking what you\u2019re offering. I think our constructive ambiguity hasn\u2019t really helped us over the last two years. We have tried to say to Brexit voters \u2018we are in favour of Brexit\u2019 but to remain voters \u2018we are in favour of remain\u2019 and in the end you\u2019re not. I am fundamentally a remainer and I believe it it is in the interest of Wales, and our country, that we should at the very least try and achieve as softer Brexit as possible so that we can continue trading with Europe. Bryant put a brave face on the result. \u201cIn the end biggest problem for the Labour party is that we nearly lost our deposit. I\u2019m glad we didn\u2019t lose our deposit, lots of people were talking about that going to happen.\u201d He also claimed Labour was likely to call a vote on no-confidence in September. He said: \u201cI would be amazed if we were not to table a motion of no confidence, and I will be wholeheartedly supporting it.\u201d Jane Dodds continues to portray her victory as a rejection of a no-deal Brexit. Speaking to Sky News she said: Here in Brecon and Radnorshire what people were talking with us about, particularly those working in agriculture, is that a no-deal Brexit here would decimate the farming industry. That\u2019s the first thing that I want to make sure Boris Johnson understands. He now has to listen that a no-deal Brexit would be a disaster for our farming and agricultural communities here. I\u2019m determined to find Mr. Johnson, wherever he\u2019s hiding. And so you\u2019ve got to listen, you really got to listen to what this has said. This has said that the people are breaking the Radnorshire do not want a new deal Brexit. We\u2019ve burst his bubble and the first week of his Premiership, and he has to listen to that. Asked if the LibDems would support a soft Brexit, Dodds said: \u201cWe\u2019ve said very clearly that any deal that goes before Parliament must be attached to people\u2019s vote.\u201d On electoral pacts she said: \u201cWe were delighted that the Green Party and Plaid Cymru decided to stand down here. They knew we could beat the Conservatives by doing that, but secondly, it was symbolic of adult grown up politics.\u201d Asked if the LibDems would step aside in other seats in return, she said: \u201cwe\u2019re open to that.\u201d Still no official reaction from Labour on the byelection. Jeremy Corbyn is instead focussing on flooding and the damaged dam at Whaley Bridge. Here\u2019s Swinson\u2019s congratulatory message to Dodds: Liberal Democrats are winning again. And this byelection victory shows that the people of Brecon and Radnorshire not only have a first class MP in Jane Dodds, but they have shown the people of Britain that we can do better than the choice on offer between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn. Liberal Democrats have a vision for a cleaner, safer, richer country in the European Union. And as leader of the Liberal Democrats, I will fight to keep our country in the European Union. And we now have in Parliament, one more MP who will fight to make that happen. Jane Dodds will be a first class representative for Brecon and Radnorshire, and potentially a key vote in cutting Boris Johnson\u2019s majority to just one. Congratulations, Jane. Dodds: \u2018we\u2019ve burst Boris Johnson\u2019s bubble\u2019 Jane Dodds says her victory in the byelection has burst Boris Johnson\u2019s bubble. Speaking after being congratulated in person by Jo Swinson, Dodds said: Here we stand bursting Boris Johnson\u2019s bubble in the first week of his premiership. And here we are saying to him very loud and clear that farmers and agricultural workers here will not tolerate a no-deal Brexit. That families who work hard will not put up with the indignity of going to food banks and that everybody including, especially our young people, want to see a much clearer and faster action on the climate emergency. We are very clear that this opportunity. I want to that voice in parliament that demands from Boris Johnson that he acts on these issue. I look forward to being the rural voice of Wales and Liberalism in Parliament. Labour is staying very quiet about the result after its candidate, Tom Davies, almost lost his deposit. Heidi Allen, the former Tory MP, then leader of Change UK, and now a member of the Independent group, described the results as \u201cutterly brilliant\u201d. David Cameron\u2019s former director of communications reckons the Conservatives won\u2019t be that disheartened by the result. LibDem leader Jo Swinson is about to congratulate her new parliamentary colleague, Jane Dodds, at a garden party in the Brecon Beacons. Steven Morris is there: The Green party says the result of the byelection was vindication of its decision to stand aside in favour of the LibDems. Anthony Slaughter, leader of the Wales Green Party, said: \u201cThe local Green Parties in the constituency made a decision, in the light of the critical circumstances of this moment, with the finely balanced parliament in Westminster, to withdraw in order to maximise the chances of a Remain MP. \u201cThat decision is absolutely vindicated by this result. The people of Brecon and Radnorshire have taken the opportunity to cut Boris Johnson\u2019s majority in Westminster to a highly unstable one, reducing further the risk of a disastrous crash-out Brexit. \u201cAnd the Green party\u2019s decision was key to that: the Liberal Democrat majority was 1,400 votes. We got 1,300 votes in the seat in 2015, while Plaid Cymru, who also withdrew from the by-election, also got that many votes. \u201cOf course what we need is a change to the undemocratic voting system, to ensure that everywhere in every nation votes can express their political preferences, vote for what they believe in and get it. But until we elect a parliament in Westminster that will reform our system and bring our politics into the 21st century, we have to work within the system we have.\u201d ITV\u2019s political editor has this: Liz Saville Roberts, leader of Plaid Cymru in Westminster, said Labour had been punished in the byelection for putting tribalism before the national interest. Here\u2019s a graphic of Brecon and Radnoshire result: The Shetland byelection, triggered by the resignation of long-serving Scottish Lib Dem MSP Tavish Scott, may not be attracting quite so much UK media attention, but here\u2019s a thing: it will now be the first time that prisoners are able to vote in a Scottish election. The Scottish government has announced that prisoners serving sentences of 12 months or less and who normally live in the island constituency, will have the right to vote: the ruling is expected to apply to fewer than five people. This brings Scotland into line with the European Court of Human Rights, which said in 2005 that the UK government\u2019s blanket ban was a breach of prisoners\u2019 human rights. In 2017, the UK government announced a compromise, but only after franchise powers had been devolved to Holyrood. A bill has been lodged at the Scottish parliament to do likewise, but the constitutional relations secretary, Michael Russell, has now passed this remedial order to ensure that the Shetland byelection aligns with the ECHR ruling. The Scottish Tories are unimpressed, describing it as an \u201cill-judged move\u201d which opens to door to prisoner voting and has been done without proper debate or consultation. Alistair Campbell hailed the byelection as a victory for the \u201cremain alliance\u201d. Campbell, who was Tony Blair\u2019s director of communication, was expelled from Labour after voting LibDem in the European election. Last week he said he had no wish to be readmitted to Labour in part because of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s failure to unequivocally back a second referendum. Swinson also predicted further electoral pacts between pro-EU parties following the byelection. Speaking to Today she said: \u201cI do think that working across party lines is important when there is so much at stake for the future of our country and I will continue to do that. \u201cI\u2019ve exchanged messages this morning with the Green and Plaid leaderships and I think there will be more co-operation in future elections.\u201d The new LibDem leader, Jo Swinson, said the byelection demonstrated there is no public consent for pursuing a no deal Brexit. Speaking to BBC Breakfast she said: \u201cIt\u2019s really good for the Liberal Democrats. But I think this has wider national significance. Not only does it cut Boris Johnson\u2019s majority to just one and show that there isn\u2019t a mandate for his no deal Brexit. This also shows hope to people in this country that they don\u2019t have to settle for that choice between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, there is a more positive alternative available \u2013 the Liberal Democrats.\u201d She said the many people in the leave-voting constituency of Brecon and Radnorshire were worried about the impact of a no deal Brexit. She said such an outcome would have a devastating impact on the rural economy as tariffs on lamb exports would put many sheep farmers out of business. \u201cIt is not surprising that people here have sent a very clear message to Boris Johnson that he needs to change his plan,\u201d she said. Swinson admitted that LibDems played the system by persuading the Greens and Plaid Cymru to pull out of the byelection to allow her party a clear run at the seat. She said: \u201cI do genuinely say thank you to Plaid and the Greens. And I\u2019ve been in touch with their leaders this morning to express that personally, because they put the national interest first and stood aside. \u201cWe are working the system that we have, we have won a victory with a 12% swing overturning an 8,000 majority. And this comes off the back of our best of our local election results and storming victories in the European elections where we beat both the Conservatives and the Labour parties to our best ever European election results too. So this is a sustained pattern of Liberal Democrats winning again, on the up.\u201d Tory party chairman, James Cleverly, conceded that the byelection was \u201cdisappointing\u201d for the Tories but pointed out that the Labour party had moved backwards in support. He told Today: \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing to lose a parliamentary colleague, obviously. But what we saw here was a very close result in a byelection which the Lib Dems were expecting to romp home comfortably.\u201d He added: \u201cWhat we also saw was the Labour Party, the official opposition, the party that claims to be ready to step in, almost losing their deposit well in Wales. They moved backwards.\u201d The elections experts, John Curtice, says the result of the byelection should make Boris Johnson cautious about going for a snap election. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme he said the vote showed the Tories were enjoying a \u201cBoris bounce\u201d but only at the expense of the Brexit party. He said: \u201cIn an early general election at the moment at least, the Conservatives would be at risk of losing.\u201d He added: \u201cWhen thinking about the prospects for an early general election. If the Liberal Democrats could pick up 40 or 50 seats, winning a large overall majority, which seems to be the point of a snap election, would become rather more difficult for the Conservatives would otherwise be the case.\u201d He said the result confirmed recent opinion polls putting the Conservatives above their performance in the European and local elections but 10% below their total in the last general election. He said: \u201cThe Boris bounce is good news for the conservatives. It\u2019s encouraging, as is the result of this by election despite the loss, but it\u2019s not necessarily substantial enough for anybody to want to precipitate an early general election with any great degree of confidence that you would end up with an arithmetic in the House of Commons that was significantly better than the one that the Prime Minister is currently going to have to deal with.\u201d \u201cTough night,\u201d Ukip has posted on Twitter. Ukip placed last in yesterday\u2019s vote, behind the Monster Raving Loony Party. An interesting take on the Tory loss in the Telegraph today, which seems to argue that the real winners on the day were... the Conservatives. \ud83e\udd14 It\u2019s paywalled, so for those who haven\u2019t subscribed, here\u2019s a brief sample. This was an election that the Lib Dems threw the kitchen sink at and should have been a shoo-in for them. The fact that it wasn\u2019t and that the Conservatives finished a close second, suggests Boris Johnson has got the Conservatives back into play electorally in what is a high risk winner takes all general election strategy. All the same, nothing in this result suggests anything other than ongoing voter unpredictability. With all the indicators pointing to a 1990s style Lib Dem gain against a Government in difficulties, enter right the Tories Lord Flashheart, one Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, injecting confidence, charisma and optimism as a dynamic new Prime Minister and taking Government by the scuff [sic] of its neck. It clearly made a difference, giving Tories something positive to vote for and, more importantly in a 52:48 per cent Brexit split constituency, he had a renewed focus on taking the UK out of the EU on October 31. The Conservatives returned in this by-election to the party of leave and therefore Brexit, in a successful strategy to squeeze the Brexit Party vote. Boris becoming Prime Minister even for just over a week but with a new Brexit delivery agenda, injected an element of uncertainty into proceedings right up to the announcement of the result. In just over a week Boris moved his party from a position of no hope to coming close to victory. A reminder from the Guardian\u2019s Hannah Jane Parkinson about the circumstances that led to yesterday\u2019s byelection. In case you missed it yesterday, Sonia Sodha\u2019s comment piece on the government\u2019s announcement of a \u00a32.1bn for no-deal planning is well worth a read. Here\u2019s a taste: It beggars belief that the government is spending billions \u2013 \u00a36.3bn so far this year \u2013 on contingency planning in case it decides to take us into a self-imposed economic disaster that is entirely avoidable. On the other hand, if Boris Johnson is deluded enough to proceed with crashing Britain out of the EU without a deal \u2013 and many of his actions as prime minister suggest that he is \u2013 the couple of billion announced this morning will feel like small change compared with what the government and businesses will have to spend to mitigate the long-term economic pain of no deal... Unless parliament can find a way to stop it, the chances of no deal are increasing by the day. Johnson could have eradicated the need for no-deal contingency spending by being clear he\u2019d never commit to such a grossly negligent act of economic self-harm. But he boxed himself in with his \u201cdo or die\u201d rhetoric during the Tory leadership contest. And so money that could have been spent elsewhere \u2013 \u00a36.3bn would boost the annual social care budget by almost a third \u2013 continues to be spent getting ready for something business leaders have warned Britain can never be ready for. That\u2019s not even taking into account the billions that the CBI says businesses have spent on their own contingency planning. One thing is certain: if we do crash out with no deal, that \u00a36.3bn will seem like peanuts. If borne out, those OBR forecasts will translate into hundreds of thousands more people losing their jobs; small businesses going bankrupt; people who already struggle to pay the mortgage finding themselves trapped in negative equity. And it\u2019s going to be those areas of the country hardest hit by decades of deindustrialisation and the financial crisis that will feel the economic pain of no deal most sharply. The Treasury won\u2019t know what\u2019s hit it. The full article is here. Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, has a busy morning ahead in light of the byelection victory, as well as visiting the constituency at 9am, she will be doing a lot of radio. Good morning and welcome to the politics liveblog. I\u2019ll be holding the fort for the early shift, before the unparalleled Andrew Sparrow takes over later on. The big news overnight was that the Liberal Democrats\u2019 candidate, Jane Dodds, won the seat of Brecon and Radnorshire in the byelection, cutting Johnson\u2019s Commons majority to one. The Liberal Democrats won 13,826 votes, with the Conservatives taking 12,401, a narrow majority of 1,425 that overturned the Tories\u2019 previous majority of more than 8,000. It was a sobering night for the Labour party (1,680 votes), which was beaten into fourth place by the Brexit party (3,331), and only just held on to its deposit. Ukip came last behind the Monster Raving Loony Party. The defeat will be a major blow to the Tories and will be seized on as a sign voters are concerned by Boris Johnson\u2019s pledge to leave the EU without a deal if necessary. In her acceptance speech, Dodds said that the vote \u201csent a powerful message to Westminster: we demand better\u201d and said her first act as MP would be \u201cto find Boris Johnson, wherever he\u2019s hiding, and tell him loud and clear: stop playing with the futures of our communities and rule out a no-deal Brexit.\u201d Ed Davey, the Lib Dem MP for Kingston and Surbiton, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a huge result. Not only is it the Liberal Democrats back in Wales and continues the momentum we had in the locals and Europeans but it\u2019s massive for the party arithmetic over Brexit The Brecon and Radnorshire by-election was the front-line of the stop Brexit campaign. This is going to make Boris Johnson\u2019s job that much more difficult and for those of us who are desperate to stop Brexit it\u2019s a crucial moment.\u201d The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, will visit Brecon and Radnorshire this morning at 9am, and we will be watching for comment and reaction from MPs as the day unfolds.

      "body": "<p>Global stocks fell sharply on Friday after Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/02/global-markets-take-fright-as-trump-ramps-up-us-china-trade-war\">threatened to impose tariffs</a> on $300bn (\u00a3247.6bn) of Chinese goods in a rapid escalation of the trade war between the world\u2019s two biggest economies. </p> <h2><strong>Why is Trump imposing tariffs on China?</strong></h2> <p>Trump is applying pressure to try to force China to narrow the trade deficit \u2013 the gap between imports and exports \u2013 between the two countries. He complains that China buys fewer US goods than the US buys from China, a gap worth <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c5700.html\">$419.5bn last year</a>. He has also accused Chinese firms of stealing US companies\u2019 intellectual property and called for Beijing to alter its rules.</p> <h2><strong>How do tariffs work?</strong></h2> <p>Tariffs are border taxes imposed by one country or economic bloc on goods shipped from a trading partner. The idea is to drive up the cost of those goods to make them less attractive to consumers than domestic produce. The taxes are paid by buyers of goods when they cross the border into the country imposing the tariff.</p> <h2><strong>What is the scale of the latest </strong><strong>threat?</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d5f56647da04cd3bc4c947a5bff9589cff6d8ac6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5f56647da04cd3bc4c947a5bff9589cff6d8ac6/245_130_3951_2371/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump is applying pressure to try to force China to narrow the trade deficit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Liu Jie/Xinhua/Barcroft Media</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trump is threatening tariffs of 10% on $300bn of Chinese imports. The White House already levies tariffs of 25% on $250bn of Chinese goods. Adding both together would mean roughly all Chinese imports to the US face higher taxes. China sold <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c5700.html\">$539.7bn of goods</a> to the US last year.</p> <h2><strong>What other tariffs are in place</strong><strong>?</strong></h2> <p>Beijing has retaliated with tariffs of up to 25% on US goods worth $113bn. China is constrained by how much further it can go, given that total imports from the US were worth $120.1bn last year. However, the trade war has extended beyond tariffs before, with rules to make life difficult for US or Chinese companies, such as the US blacklisting the Chinese technology company Huawei.</p> <h2><strong>How could it affect the global economy?</strong></h2> <p>The International Monetary Fund has said the US-China trade war is dragging on global growth. Last month it said the conflict would cut growth by 0.1 percentage points in 2019 and 2020 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/apr/09/imf-no-deal-brexit-risks-two-year-recession-uk-economic\">from its April forecasts</a>, at 3.2% and 3.5% respectively. International trade growth has stalled and business investment has been paused because of the uncertainty over trade. Factory output has stalled in several countries including the UK, Germany and Italy, with a knock-on impact on growth. Central banks including the US Federal Reserve and European Central Bank are under pressure to cut interest rates as a consequence.</p> <h2><strong>Is a peace deal in sight?</strong></h2> <p>The escalation from Trump was a surprise and China has said it will not be intimidated \u2013 a sign that the conflict will not dissipate quickly. Economists believe tariffs could just be a negotiating tactic and the US president has flip-flopped before, raising hopes of a resolution. Trump could also expand his trade war to involve other nations, as well as the EU. He has tariffs on car imports in his sights, ostensibly to protect the US auto industry. Economists say imposing car tariffs on the EU would dramatically escalate the global trade war and further damage global growth.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Global stocks fell sharply on Friday after Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on $300bn (\u00a3247.6bn) of Chinese goods in a rapid escalation of the trade war between the world\u2019s two biggest economies. Why is Trump imposing tariffs on China? Trump is applying pressure to try to force China to narrow the trade deficit \u2013 the gap between imports and exports \u2013 between the two countries. He complains that China buys fewer US goods than the US buys from China, a gap worth $419.5bn last year. He has also accused Chinese firms of stealing US companies\u2019 intellectual property and called for Beijing to alter its rules. How do tariffs work? Tariffs are border taxes imposed by one country or economic bloc on goods shipped from a trading partner. The idea is to drive up the cost of those goods to make them less attractive to consumers than domestic produce. The taxes are paid by buyers of goods when they cross the border into the country imposing the tariff. What is the scale of the latest threat? Trump is threatening tariffs of 10% on $300bn of Chinese imports. The White House already levies tariffs of 25% on $250bn of Chinese goods. Adding both together would mean roughly all Chinese imports to the US face higher taxes. China sold $539.7bn of goods to the US last year. What other tariffs are in place? Beijing has retaliated with tariffs of up to 25% on US goods worth $113bn. China is constrained by how much further it can go, given that total imports from the US were worth $120.1bn last year. However, the trade war has extended beyond tariffs before, with rules to make life difficult for US or Chinese companies, such as the US blacklisting the Chinese technology company Huawei. How could it affect the global economy? The International Monetary Fund has said the US-China trade war is dragging on global growth. Last month it said the conflict would cut growth by 0.1 percentage points in 2019 and 2020 from its April forecasts, at 3.2% and 3.5% respectively. International trade growth has stalled and business investment has been paused because of the uncertainty over trade. Factory output has stalled in several countries including the UK, Germany and Italy, with a knock-on impact on growth. Central banks including the US Federal Reserve and European Central Bank are under pressure to cut interest rates as a consequence. Is a peace deal in sight? The escalation from Trump was a surprise and China has said it will not be intimidated \u2013 a sign that the conflict will not dissipate quickly. Economists believe tariffs could just be a negotiating tactic and the US president has flip-flopped before, raising hopes of a resolution. Trump could also expand his trade war to involve other nations, as well as the EU. He has tariffs on car imports in his sights, ostensibly to protect the US auto industry. Economists say imposing car tariffs on the EU would dramatically escalate the global trade war and further damage global growth.",

Liverpool were good enough last time out to have been crowned champions in 116 of the previous 119 seasons.

It may do so again this season. But Klopp\u2019s side, who were 11.7mm from remaining unbeaten in the league last season, had John Stones not scooped off the goalline at the Etihad Stadium in their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/03/manchester-city-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">only defeat</a>, know they pose the greatest threat to City\u2019s dominance. They know they have the talent and depth to sustain a challenge. Since 1 June they know what it is to be winners too. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/07/liverpool-barcelona-champions-league-semi-final-second-leg-match-report\">comeback against Barcelona</a> changed everything for a team that have shed the substantial weight of nearly men. Champions of Europe is a more inspirational mantle as they pursue the club\u2019s first league title for 30 years, a truly ludicrous stretch for a club of Anfield\u2019s resources.</p> \n<p>Liverpool have progressed each season under Klopp but improving on a club record points tally plus the ultimate triumph in Madrid presents a formidable challenge for the manager who has unified Anfield. With no senior additions at the time of writing, he is seeking further improvement within a comparatively young but experienced and balanced squad. His track record of developing players, whether bought or inherited, suggests that is achievable, but it is not wholly desirable given the lack of cover for Virgil van Dijk or Andy Robertson.</p> \n<p>On and off the pitch Liverpool are a settled unit. There is no requirement for the tactical shift of 12 months ago given the success of Liverpool\u2019s more compact midfield, the protection that afforded the best defence in the Premier League and the overall consistency it produced. Liverpool conceded 22 league goals and 38 in 53 games in total. No goalkeeper preserved more clean sheets than Alisson, who kept 21 in his debut term in English football, proved an immovable obstacle to Tottenham in the Champions League final and maintained his outstanding form throughout Brazil\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/08/brazil-peru-copa-america-tite-neymar\">successful Copa Am\u00e9rica campaign</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/07/liverpool-zip/giv-3902cfsl3vgPX2z7/\" data-alt=\"Last five seasons\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/07/liverpool-zip/giv-3902cfsl3vgPX2z7/\">Last five seasons</a> \n</figure> \n<p>The \u00a365m goalkeeper corrected a fundamental weakness in the Liverpool team as the \u00a375m Van Dijk had done before him. Together they made a virtue of Klopp\u2019s patience in the transfer market and reassured the club\u2019s hierarchy that big fees are worth paying for those who yield a decisive influence. The lack of incomings this summer reflects the manager\u2019s belief his team requires fine-tuning rather than major surgery. It is also a byproduct of investing heavily last year, not only in new faces but in lucrative new contracts for Mohamed Salah, Sadio Man\u00e9, Roberto Firmino, Robertson, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Joe Gomez. With Van Dijk keen to follow suit and extend his Anfield career, the defensive foundation of Klopp\u2019s team will be secured for years to come. Another dividend of the internal investment, the Champions League triumph and a settled dressing room is the absence of disruptive transfer speculation surrounding Liverpool\u2019s core talent.</p> \n<p>Klopp\u2019s options are increased by the availability of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Rhian Brewster and Gomez following long-term injuries. Oxlade-Chamberlain made two brief substitute appearances at the tail end of last season as he returned ahead of schedule from a horrendous knee injury. Brewster, the 19-year-old striker whom Klopp rates so highly, missed a year\u2019s development because of serious knee and ankle problems while Gomez was sidelined for four months with a fractured leg having formed an impressive partnership with Van Dijk in central defence. The manager also considers Adam Lallana a different option, one he has deployed in a deeper midfield role in pre-season, although the England international must rediscover consistency to match his obvious ability after two injury-plagued years.</p> \n<p>Another internal candidate for the job of injecting more penetration and creativity into Liverpool\u2019s midfield is Naby Ke\u00efta. The Guinea international made only fleeting impressions last season, with injuries and perhaps a lack of confidence costing the \u00a352.75m summer arrival a consistent run, and will be expected to step up after an extensive bedding-in period.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/07/liverpool-zip/giv-3902MISij0j6jKcQ/\" data-alt=\"Last season\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/07/liverpool-zip/giv-3902MISij0j6jKcQ/\">Last season</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Brewster looked sharp early in pre-season and Klopp will need him to be, as a reservation that hangs over Liverpool\u2019s prospects \u2013 or at least their hopes of repeating last year\u2019s flying start \u2013 is the freshness of their vital front three. Salah, Firmino and Man\u00e9 came into last season on the back of brief post-World Cup holidays. Their exertions this summer finally ended on 6 July, 7 July and 19 July respectively because of Africa Cup of Nations and Copa Am\u00e9rica commitments, with Mane\u2019s involvement against Norwich in doubt on the opening day following Senegal\u2019s progress to the final. Klopp gave his players more time off during last season than ever before. He was also without the injured Xherdan Shaqiri for most of a difficult pre-seasonand faces a delicate balancing act again while dealing with a heavier workload.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"68bc874c-c080-4efb-98c1-cd42665645cc\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>No 1:</b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/29/premier-league-2019-20-preview-arsenal-unai-emery-champions-league-pepe\">Arsenal</a><br><b>No 2:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/29/premier-league-201920-preview-no-2-aston-villa\">Aston Villa</a><br><b>No 3:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/30/premier-league-2019-20-preview-bournemouth-eddie-howe\">Bournemouth</a><br><b>No 4:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/30/premier-league-201920-preview-no-4-brighton\">Brighton</a><br><b>No 5:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/31/premier-league-201920-preview-no-5-burnley\">Burnley</a><br><b>No 6:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/31/premier-league-201920-preview-no-6-chelsea\">Chelsea</a><br><b>No 7:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/01/premier-league-2019-20-preview-crystal-palace-hodgson-zaha\">Crystal Palace</a><br><b>No 8:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/01/premier-league-201920-preview-no-8-everton\">Everton</a><br><b>No 9:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/02/premier-league-2019-20-preview-leicester-brendan-rodgers-perez-tielemans\">Leicester City</a><br><b>No 10:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/02/premier-league-201920-preview-no-10-liverpool\">Liverpool</a><br><b>No 11:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/05/premier-league-201920-preview-no-11-manchester-city\">Manchester City</a><br><b>No 12:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/05/premier-league-201920-preview-no-12-manchester-united\">Manchester United</a><br><b>No 13:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/06/premier-league-201920-preview-no-13-newcastle-united\">Newcastle United</a><br><b>No 14:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/06/premier-league-201920-preview-no-14-norwich-city\">Norwich City</a><br><b>No 15:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/07/premier-league-201920-preview-no-15-sheffield-united\">Sheffield United</a><br><b>No 16:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/07/premier-league-201920-preview-no-16-southampton\">Southampton</a><br><b>No 17:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/08/premier-league-201920-preview-no-17-tottenham\">Tottenham Hotspur</a><br><b>No 18:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/08/premier-league-201920-preview-no-18-watford\">Watford</a><br><b>No 19:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/09/premier-league-201920-preview-no-19-west-ham\">West Ham</a><br><b>No 20:</b> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/09/premier-league-201920-preview-no-20-wolves\">Wolves</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Ending the wait for a 19th league championship is Liverpool\u2019s clear priority but the season offers plenty of opportunity for winning to become habit-forming. The Premier League opener is sandwiched between the Community Shield against City and the Uefa Super Cup versus Chelsea in Turkey. December squeezes in the Club World Cup in Qatar and the chance to win that title for the first time. There will also be a demand on Klopp to take the domestic cup competitions more seriously, given that his regular protestations that he does so are often undermined by his selections. There is also, of course, the Champions League to defend, with the prospect of a hat-trick of finals and a return to Istanbul in front of a Liverpool team that have never lost a European knockout tie under Klopp.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Madrid marked the end of a gruelling pursuit of silverware for Liverpool and their manager but also, they now expect, a beginning.

      "bodyText": "Guardian writers\u2019 predicted position: 2nd (NB: this is not necessarily Andy Hunter\u2019s prediction but the average of our writers\u2019 tips) Last season\u2019s position: 2nd Odds to win the league (via Oddschecker): 5-2 Amid the delirium of Liverpool\u2019s Champions League celebrations in Madrid J\u00fcrgen Klopp received a call from the man who had pipped him to the Premier League title three weeks earlier. \u201cWe promised each other that we will kick each other\u2019s butts again next season,\u201d the Liverpool manager disclosed of his exchange with a magnanimous Pep Guardiola. \u201cWe will go for everything and see what we get.\u201d Liverpool\u2019s appetite has been whetted by a sixth European crown. They look the only team capable of denying Manchester City a Premier League hat-trick. Klopp and Guardiola enter this campaign coveting above all the prize the other possesses. Liverpool were good enough last time out to have been crowned champions in 116 of the previous 119 seasons. Yet even a remarkable haul of 97 points was not enough to overcome a flawless domestic rival. That demoralising reality could have lingered into this season but for the release that arrived at Estadio Metropolitano. Waiting for the champions to falter during an enthralling run-in proved punishing and futile for Liverpool. It may do so again this season. But Klopp\u2019s side, who were 11.7mm from remaining unbeaten in the league last season, had John Stones not scooped off the goalline at the Etihad Stadium in their only defeat, know they pose the greatest threat to City\u2019s dominance. They know they have the talent and depth to sustain a challenge. Since 1 June they know what it is to be winners too. The comeback against Barcelona changed everything for a team that have shed the substantial weight of nearly men. Champions of Europe is a more inspirational mantle as they pursue the club\u2019s first league title for 30 years, a truly ludicrous stretch for a club of Anfield\u2019s resources. Liverpool have progressed each season under Klopp but improving on a club record points tally plus the ultimate triumph in Madrid presents a formidable challenge for the manager who has unified Anfield. With no senior additions at the time of writing, he is seeking further improvement within a comparatively young but experienced and balanced squad. His track record of developing players, whether bought or inherited, suggests that is achievable, but it is not wholly desirable given the lack of cover for Virgil van Dijk or Andy Robertson. On and off the pitch Liverpool are a settled unit. There is no requirement for the tactical shift of 12 months ago given the success of Liverpool\u2019s more compact midfield, the protection that afforded the best defence in the Premier League and the overall consistency it produced. Liverpool conceded 22 league goals and 38 in 53 games in total. No goalkeeper preserved more clean sheets than Alisson, who kept 21 in his debut term in English football, proved an immovable obstacle to Tottenham in the Champions League final and maintained his outstanding form throughout Brazil\u2019s successful Copa Am\u00e9rica campaign. The \u00a365m goalkeeper corrected a fundamental weakness in the Liverpool team as the \u00a375m Van Dijk had done before him. Together they made a virtue of Klopp\u2019s patience in the transfer market and reassured the club\u2019s hierarchy that big fees are worth paying for those who yield a decisive influence. The lack of incomings this summer reflects the manager\u2019s belief his team requires fine-tuning rather than major surgery. It is also a byproduct of investing heavily last year, not only in new faces but in lucrative new contracts for Mohamed Salah, Sadio Man\u00e9, Roberto Firmino, Robertson, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Joe Gomez. With Van Dijk keen to follow suit and extend his Anfield career, the defensive foundation of Klopp\u2019s team will be secured for years to come. Another dividend of the internal investment, the Champions League triumph and a settled dressing room is the absence of disruptive transfer speculation surrounding Liverpool\u2019s core talent. Klopp\u2019s options are increased by the availability of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Rhian Brewster and Gomez following long-term injuries. Oxlade-Chamberlain made two brief substitute appearances at the tail end of last season as he returned ahead of schedule from a horrendous knee injury. Brewster, the 19-year-old striker whom Klopp rates so highly, missed a year\u2019s development because of serious knee and ankle problems while Gomez was sidelined for four months with a fractured leg having formed an impressive partnership with Van Dijk in central defence. The manager also considers Adam Lallana a different option, one he has deployed in a deeper midfield role in pre-season, although the England international must rediscover consistency to match his obvious ability after two injury-plagued years. Another internal candidate for the job of injecting more penetration and creativity into Liverpool\u2019s midfield is Naby Ke\u00efta. The Guinea international made only fleeting impressions last season, with injuries and perhaps a lack of confidence costing the \u00a352.75m summer arrival a consistent run, and will be expected to step up after an extensive bedding-in period. Brewster looked sharp early in pre-season and Klopp will need him to be, as a reservation that hangs over Liverpool\u2019s prospects \u2013 or at least their hopes of repeating last year\u2019s flying start \u2013 is the freshness of their vital front three. Salah, Firmino and Man\u00e9 came into last season on the back of brief post-World Cup holidays. Their exertions this summer finally ended on 6 July, 7 July and 19 July respectively because of Africa Cup of Nations and Copa Am\u00e9rica commitments, with Mane\u2019s involvement against Norwich in doubt on the opening day following Senegal\u2019s progress to the final. Klopp gave his players more time off during last season than ever before. He was also without the injured Xherdan Shaqiri for most of a difficult pre-seasonand faces a delicate balancing act again while dealing with a heavier workload. Ending the wait for a 19th league championship is Liverpool\u2019s clear priority but the season offers plenty of opportunity for winning to become habit-forming. The Premier League opener is sandwiched between the Community Shield against City and the Uefa Super Cup versus Chelsea in Turkey. December squeezes in the Club World Cup in Qatar and the chance to win that title for the first time. There will also be a demand on Klopp to take the domestic cup competitions more seriously, given that his regular protestations that he does so are often undermined by his selections. There is also, of course, the Champions League to defend, with the prospect of a hat-trick of finals and a return to Istanbul in front of a Liverpool team that have never lost a European knockout tie under Klopp. Madrid marked the end of a gruelling pursuit of silverware for Liverpool and their manager but also, they now expect, a beginning. As Van Dijk said as he savoured victory over Spurs in June: \u201cThis is just the start. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re going away.\u201d Guardiola had accepted as much long before he picked up his phone.",

      "bodyText": "At this point in the year, certain tropes of summer dressing become unavoidable \u2013 batik, florals, raffia and some of the more \u201ctropical\u201d animal prints, such as tiger and zebra. But this year the fashion memo comes with some new offerings \u2013 or very old offerings, revived with modern twists. A lot of them hail from the 60s and 70s and sit at the cross-section of hippie and bohemian culture. The mood is vintage Glastonbury or Woodstock, homespun and crafty, only elevated. It is tie-dye, fringing and, my personal favourite, crochet. The summer crochet knit used to be one of those things to which I was mildly allergic. Why wear something so thick during the hottest months of the year? Not to mention the fact it can look bulky. For all my body positivity, I couldn\u2019t get past the way it added textured lumps to my boobs and hips. Then the spring/summer 2019 catwalk shows rolled around. Altuzarra did crochet in long, lithe, fishnet-style dresses with jangly seashell embellishments that made the models look like swanky mermaids on their way to a fortnight in Capri. JW Anderson\u2019s crochet came in a more swingy shape, but no less cool and skin-revealing, exactly the thing you would want to wear in a heat wave. Chlo\u00e9 and Oscar de la Renta also made a strong case for reconsidering the summer knit with shapes that were fluid and lean. I wanted in. So here I am, wearing crochet for the first time in my adult life and enjoying it. That is mostly down to my choice of dress: a multicoloured, body-skimming style by Staud, the California-based brand known for its cult bucket bags, but worth paying attention to for its impressive spin on retro summer style. The beauty of this dress lies in its versatility: I would feel just as great in this at Notting Hill carnival (styled up with a pair of Birkenstocks, enormous hoop earrings and a slew of gold chains from my summer rotation) as I would at work (where I would wear the Ancient Greek sandals I am wearing here). I had similar luck finding good fashion-crochet when browsing at Zara and Ganni. The key to feeling at ease is to go long in a slim shape, or short with a clear A-line. Flats tend to look best; a stiletto would undermine that relaxed, carefree mood. At this point in the summer, who wants to dress for anything other than that? \u2022 Kenya Hunt is the deputy editor of Elle magazine. She wears dress, \u00a3295, by Staud, from matchesfashion.com. Earrings and sandals Kenya\u2019s own",

This is not science fiction. It is the reality of climate change. It is happening now and it will worsen in the future without urgent climate action.\u201d</p>",

It found that the extreme heat in France and the Netherlands, where temperatures peaked above 40C, was made at least 10 times and possibly more than 100 times more likely by climate change. In the UK, which set a record of 38.7C on 25 July, the human impact on the climate made the high temperatures at least two to three times more probable. There was considerable variation from place to place, but in all the studied locations the scientists said it would have been 1.5C to 3C cooler without climate change. Although the recent heat has been described as historic, it is unlikely to remain that way for long, according to the authors of the study. \u201cIt will not make history. These records will be broken in few years,\u201d said Friederike Otto, of the University of Oxford. \u201cWhat we see with European heatwaves is that all the climate models are underestimating the change that we see.\u201d She said further study would investigate how likely it was to have two intense heatwaves in the space of two months. The paper says the extreme heat will have an impact on human wellbeing, though the data on this often lags, which can mean it fails to draw much public attention. \u201cHeatwaves during the height of summer pose a substantial risk to human health and are potentially lethal,\u201d the paper says. \u201cThe full impact is known only after a few weeks when the mortality figures have been analysed. Effective heat emergency plans, together with accurate weather forecasts such as those issued before this heatwave, reduce impacts and are becoming even more important in light of the rising risks.\u201d The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, who has called a special climate summit of world leaders in September, said the seasons were moving alarmingly far from their usual path. \u201cWe have always lived through hot summers, but this is not the summer of our youth. This is not your grandfather\u2019s summer,\u201d he said. \u201cPreventing irreversible climate disruption is the race of our lives, and for our lives. It is a race that we can and must win.\u201d The World Meteorological Organization expects 2015-19 to be the warmest five-year period ever recorded. \u201cJuly has rewritten climate history, with dozens of new temperature records at local, national and global level,\u201d said the organisation\u2019s secretary general, Petteri Taalas. \u201cUnprecedented wildfires raged in the Arctic for the second consecutive month, devastating once pristine forests which used to absorb carbon dioxide and instead turning them into fiery sources of greenhouse gases. This is not science fiction. It is the reality of climate change. It is happening now and it will worsen in the future without urgent climate action.\u201d",

Before recess, 17 Conservatives voted for Dominic Grieve\u2019s amendment to the Northern Ireland bill, which was aimed at preventing prorogation, including the former ministers Alistair Burt, Sarah Newton, Margot James and Steve Brine.

Independents and Change UK The House of Commons has acquired a rag-tag bunch of 17 independent MPs over the past two years and with such a tiny majority, their votes could make all the difference. One group of independents are passionately pro-remain, some of them former Tory and Labour MPs who left and formed Change UK and then left that fledgling party. There are five in that category: Heidi Allen, Sarah Wollaston, Luciana Berger, Angela Smith and Gavin Shuker. All of them would vote to block no deal, and although a confidence vote would probably lead to them losing their seats, they would probably be willing to vote down the government. The remaining five members of what is now the Independent Group for Change, including Chris Leslie and Anna Soubry, who have previously said they would vote with the government in a confidence vote, may also vote down Johnson if the alternative is no deal. Charlie Elphicke, the former Tory MP who is currently suspended from the party while charged with sexual assault, is likely to vote with the government. Indeed, several commentators have claimed it is wrong to consider Johnson\u2019s majority as one since Elphicke is likely to act as a Tory. Likewise, the suspended Labour MP Chris Williamson is likely to follow the Labour whip. Three former Labour MPs who quit their parties in anger at the leadership \u2013 Frank Field, Ian Austin and John Woodcock \u2013 feel so strongly opposed to Jeremy Corbyn that they could vote with Johnson in a confidence vote, and Woodcock did vote with the government last time around. Others are less predictable, including the former Labour MP Jared O\u2019Mara, who has been largely absent from parliament and says he intends to quit in September, and Sylvia Hermon, the Northern Irish independent MP, who is strongly opposed to no deal but has previously voted with the government in a confidence vote. The DUP Johnson has spent many hours since he entered Downing Street trying to woo back the Democratic Unionist party, and its leaders have expressed confidence in his pursuit of an EU exit, deal or no deal, by 31 October.

      "body": "<p>In the recent movie <em>Late Night</em>, Mindy Kaling plays a naive young comedy writer joining the writing team on a late-night US chat show. The staff are exclusively white, male, expensively educated and surly \u2013 a running gag is that every one uses the women\u2019s restroom to defecate because no women work in the office. Kaling, as a perky \u201cdiversity hire\u201d, shakes up the show and drags it into the 21st century. It\u2019s a wish fulfilment comedy: what would actually happen, with just one woman or person of colour in the room, is that the lads would carry on being sexist and racist but would then swivel their heads at her like ventriloquist dummies to check that she was \u201ccool\u201d with it.</p> <p>US writers\u2019 rooms have a feral romance to them, as seen in shows such as <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2008/feb/07/30rockisthebestshowonte\" title=\"\">30 Rock</a></em>, which was inspired by Tina Fey\u2019s real time as head writer on <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/saturday-night-live\" title=\"\">Saturday Night Live</a></em>, when her male peers would pee into jars on their office window sill and call it \u201csun tea\u201d. In the UK, we\u2019re a little more embarrassed at the idea that comedy is \u201cwritten\u201d, and feel it should be hidden away, shamefully and quietly. (When a writing partner and I asked for an office at the BBC in which to write our radio series, we were grudgingly offered \u201cThe Jill Dando room\u201d, an 8ft sq office in TV Centre featuring a King-Kong-at-the-window-scale mural of the tragically murdered TV personality. We laughed. Writers are horrible.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We know\u00a0no one cares if Simon Cowell\u2019s quip was crafted by a nerd on a 600th of his salary</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Recently, ITV announced an initiative to aim for gender-balanced writing teams on its comedy shows, which came as a shock to some people who claim to passionately love comedy but don\u2019t know how it is made. People who think <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/morecambe-and-wise\" title=\"\">Morec</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/morecambe-and-wise\" title=\"\">ambe and Wise</a> came up with all their own material, and Angela Rippon just started doing all that mad stuff with her legs on the day. You know what though? It\u2019s sort of OK \u2013 comedy writers feel deep down we are doing our job properly when you don\u2019t know we\u2019re there, like God. No, not like God: we don\u2019t have that level of self-esteem. We\u2019re like \u2026 people who pump out the toilets at music festivals. That\u2019s it. Gag writers are like the portable loo people, quietly keeping your entertainment entertaining. We know that no one at home cares if Simon Cowell is being genuinely spontaneous, or if his quip about David Walliams\u2019s trousers was crafted by a sweaty nerd on a 600th of his salary. We\u2019re just happy to be in showbiz.</p> <p>I love my job. I\u2019ve worked in more than 50 writers\u2019 rooms, not including the shows I helped develop that never made it to air. Some days I pinch myself that I\u2019m being paid to laugh my head off. On <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/horrible-histories\" title=\"\">Horrible Histories</a></em> you get free lectures from historians \u2013 it\u2019s like being paid for school, only you\u2019re actively encouraged to make fun of the lesson afterwards. Some shows I\u2019ve proudly worked on for decades, some were just a fleeting engagement in a production company office that smelled of pizza and ambition. Food is vital to the workings of a writers\u2019 room. If a producer offers to buy lunch, everyone will immediately order the most expensive thing possible, because comedy writers are tiny children, and also because you know a free lunch means you are working through lunch.</p> <p>The job has changed a lot in 10 years, but some writers\u2019 rooms do still feel loud and gladiatorial, as in <em>Late Night</em>. Often in the UK they are dominated by male Oxbridge-educated caucazoids (some of my best friends are male Oxbridge-educated caucazoids, etc, etc). Writers are generally sensitive and insecure. If you put us together in a room we will overcompensate \u2013 like the advice given to someone on their first day of prison, punch the biggest bloke in the yard.</p> <p>There was one pop-based panel show writers\u2019 room so notoriously toxic, the survivors talk as though it has been entombed in concrete like Chernobyl. A half-formed idea would get cut short with a \u201cThat\u2019s shit\u201d or \u201cNot funny\u201d. The writers\u2019 assistant would get sent out with a complicated sandwich order and a grave warning that the star would \u201close his shit\u201d if she got the order wrong. (Of course, the sandwich shop didn\u2019t exist. She was terrified! Lol!)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3c81dba3ca0123883a6b6818ca6224dead218d78\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c81dba3ca0123883a6b6818ca6224dead218d78/304_107_2682_1609/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tina Fey, Keith Powell.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tina Fey in US sitcom 30 Rock, which was inspired by her time as head writer on Saturday Night Live.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These rooms are \u201craptor pits\u201d, according to Andy Riley, co-creator of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jun/10/year-of-the-rabbit-review-silly-and-gleefully-sweary-but-where-were-the-gags\" title=\"\">Year of the Rabbit</a></em>, who has compiled a glossary of writers\u2019 room terms on his website How to Talk Comedy Writer. There is loads of secret lingo, such as \u201cDie-dia\u201d (from Kat Sadler), an idea that you feel dying in your mouth the second you start pitching. A bad room will crush a die-dia dead (\u201cthat\u2019s not funny\u201d), a good room will toss it around a bit to see what other ideas it shakes out. A die-dia is from the same family as \u201cthe bad version\u201d, which is a much derided term that a higher-up might use when pitching the shape of a joke, but not the joke itself. \u201cWe need a funny reveal for what the dog is chewing. The bad version is \u2026 a dildo? I dunno, you\u2019re the writers.\u201d Honestly, pitching \u201cthe bad version\u201d is actually really useful, but it\u2019s a thing that producers say so writers make fun of it. We don\u2019t often get to feel lofty.</p> <p>Sam Bain, co-creator of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/25/peep-show-with-female-losers-bring-it-on-sam-bain-on-why-comedy-needs-diversity\" title=\"\">Peep Show</a>,</em> says: \u201cComedy writing rooms should be like improv \u2013 \u2018Yes, and \u2026 \u2019 Rather than \u2018That\u2019s shit.\u2019\u201d When a room is good, it\u2019s heaven, a sort of sexless flirting where colleagues bat ideas back and forth and nothing is off-limits. A certain amount of inappropriateness is actually vital to the health of a room.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We warm up with\u00a0gags that get the poison out \u2013 there\u2019s no other job where you are expected to\u00a0be so appalling</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Executives who pop in can be startled by the filth and off-topic banter. It\u2019s our way of getting to know each other. Jason Hazeley, co-creator of <em>Cunk on Britain</em>, calls this \u201cdoing scales\u201d \u2013 the practice gags that warm you up for the real work. I\u2019ve also heard it called \u201cclearing the pipes\u201d or \u201cgetting the poison out\u201d. It\u2019s not pleasant, but it is funny, if dead-baby jokes before 10am are your thing. Quite why we\u2019re allowed to get away with this I\u2019m not sure, there\u2019s no other job where it\u2019s expected that you need to be appalling before you can do your job properly. \u201cSure I\u2019ll bring in this 747, but I just have to snap the legs off this heron first. It\u2019s my process.\u201d</p> <p>When the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/01/times-up-hollywood-women-launch-campaign-to-fight-sexual-harassment\" title=\"\">Time\u2019s Up</a> movement hit Hollywood there was concern that some people wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable with the \u201canything goes\u201d approach. There was a famous lawsuit where the writers\u2019 assistant on <em>Friends</em> (the only female and person of colour in the room) sued because of the eye-wateringly inappropriate conversation among the chief writers (including speculations about a female cast member\u2019s genitalia). The decision went in the show\u2019s favour, with the judge referring to the <em>Friends</em> room as \u201ca creative workplace focused on generating scripts for an adult-oriented comedy show featuring sexual themes\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e411141226d2c6832b03ad90f11b9d01c6336f11\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e411141226d2c6832b03ad90f11b9d01c6336f11/0_211_5400_3240/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sarah Morgan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I\u2019ve been in situations where later I\u2019ve pondered the weird nature of my employment\u2019 \u2026 Sarah Morgan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karla Gowlett</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve never felt unsafe or intimidated at work, but I\u2019ve been in situations where later I\u2019ve pondered the weird nature of my employment. There was a day in a small room where the head writer delivered a monologue about inserting Cadbury Mini Eggs in the non-traditional orifice of a lady friend. I didn\u2019t feel especially harassed (I almost certainly \u201cyes and\u201d-ed with egg puns) but I can\u2019t speak for the young woman whose job it was to sit and take notes all day. Crucially, I\u2019m not sure it was a super-productive way to write in-house sketches for the website of a luxury car brand.</p> <p>While no one wants to think about how the sausage is made, it\u2019s a fact that most shows have writers\u2019 rooms \u2013 panel shows, award shows, sketch shows, topical news shows, a chat show for a popular fake TV judge \u2026 they are all team written. Though you\u2019d be forgiven for not knowing that if you look at the credits. \u201cWriters\u201d aren\u2019t much of a thing in comedy, outside sitcoms. They are credited as \u201cprogramme associates\u201d (or \u201cadditional material\u201d). Programme associates are the modest heroes thinking of funny captions for a photo of a puffin, or writing questions about Boris Johnson\u2019s hair, or coming up with sketch ideas a talk-show host could do based round a giant papier-mache vulva that had been commissioned by the production company for another show but didn\u2019t get used. (These are all things that have happened on programmes I have written on, sorry, been associated with.)</p> <p>But the title may not be around for ever. The Writers\u2019 Guild of Great Britain is starting a campaign to scrap positions such as \u201cprogramme associate\u201d and credit writers for their writing. \u201cWriters should always be credited as writers,\u201d says Gail Renard, former WGGB chair and member of the guild\u2019s comedy committee, \u201cor else they stand to lose their residuals, pension contributions, and other payments they\u2019ve rightly earned. Why should we be hidden in the shadows like some dark comedy secret?\u201d</p> <p>Well, there\u2019s lots of reasons why comedy writers should be kept a dark dirty secret \u2013 see above \u2013 but a reluctance to give proper credit isn\u2019t one of them.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Late Night is showing in UK cinemas.</em></p>",

On Horrible Histories you get free lectures from historians \u2013 it\u2019s like being paid for school, only you\u2019re actively encouraged to make fun of the lesson afterwards. Some shows I\u2019ve proudly worked on for decades, some were just a fleeting engagement in a production company office that smelled of pizza and ambition. Food is vital to the workings of a writers\u2019 room. If a producer offers to buy lunch, everyone will immediately order the most expensive thing possible, because comedy writers are tiny children, and also because you know a free lunch means you are working through lunch. The job has changed a lot in 10 years, but some writers\u2019 rooms do still feel loud and gladiatorial, as in Late Night. Often in the UK they are dominated by male Oxbridge-educated caucazoids (some of my best friends are male Oxbridge-educated caucazoids, etc, etc). Writers are generally sensitive and insecure. If you put us together in a room we will overcompensate \u2013 like the advice given to someone on their first day of prison, punch the biggest bloke in the yard. There was one pop-based panel show writers\u2019 room so notoriously toxic, the survivors talk as though it has been entombed in concrete like Chernobyl. A half-formed idea would get cut short with a \u201cThat\u2019s shit\u201d or \u201cNot funny\u201d. The writers\u2019 assistant would get sent out with a complicated sandwich order and a grave warning that the star would \u201close his shit\u201d if she got the order wrong. (Of course, the sandwich shop didn\u2019t exist. She was terrified! Lol!) These rooms are \u201craptor pits\u201d, according to Andy Riley, co-creator of Year of the Rabbit, who has compiled a glossary of writers\u2019 room terms on his website How to Talk Comedy Writer. There is loads of secret lingo, such as \u201cDie-dia\u201d (from Kat Sadler), an idea that you feel dying in your mouth the second you start pitching. A bad room will crush a die-dia dead (\u201cthat\u2019s not funny\u201d), a good room will toss it around a bit to see what other ideas it shakes out. A die-dia is from the same family as \u201cthe bad version\u201d, which is a much derided term that a higher-up might use when pitching the shape of a joke, but not the joke itself. \u201cWe need a funny reveal for what the dog is chewing. The bad version is \u2026 a dildo? I dunno, you\u2019re the writers.\u201d Honestly, pitching \u201cthe bad version\u201d is actually really useful, but it\u2019s a thing that producers say so writers make fun of it. We don\u2019t often get to feel lofty. Sam Bain, co-creator of Peep Show, says: \u201cComedy writing rooms should be like improv \u2013 \u2018Yes, and \u2026 \u2019 Rather than \u2018That\u2019s shit.\u2019\u201d When a room is good, it\u2019s heaven, a sort of sexless flirting where colleagues bat ideas back and forth and nothing is off-limits. A certain amount of inappropriateness is actually vital to the health of a room. Executives who pop in can be startled by the filth and off-topic banter. It\u2019s our way of getting to know each other. Jason Hazeley, co-creator of Cunk on Britain, calls this \u201cdoing scales\u201d \u2013 the practice gags that warm you up for the real work. I\u2019ve also heard it called \u201cclearing the pipes\u201d or \u201cgetting the poison out\u201d. It\u2019s not pleasant, but it is funny, if dead-baby jokes before 10am are your thing. Quite why we\u2019re allowed to get away with this I\u2019m not sure, there\u2019s no other job where it\u2019s expected that you need to be appalling before you can do your job properly. \u201cSure I\u2019ll bring in this 747, but I just have to snap the legs off this heron first. It\u2019s my process.\u201d When the Time\u2019s Up movement hit Hollywood there was concern that some people wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable with the \u201canything goes\u201d approach. There was a famous lawsuit where the writers\u2019 assistant on Friends (the only female and person of colour in the room) sued because of the eye-wateringly inappropriate conversation among the chief writers (including speculations about a female cast member\u2019s genitalia). The decision went in the show\u2019s favour, with the judge referring to the Friends room as \u201ca creative workplace focused on generating scripts for an adult-oriented comedy show featuring sexual themes\u201d. I\u2019ve never felt unsafe or intimidated at work, but I\u2019ve been in situations where later I\u2019ve pondered the weird nature of my employment. There was a day in a small room where the head writer delivered a monologue about inserting Cadbury Mini Eggs in the non-traditional orifice of a lady friend. I didn\u2019t feel especially harassed (I almost certainly \u201cyes and\u201d-ed with egg puns) but I can\u2019t speak for the young woman whose job it was to sit and take notes all day. Crucially, I\u2019m not sure it was a super-productive way to write in-house sketches for the website of a luxury car brand. While no one wants to think about how the sausage is made, it\u2019s a fact that most shows have writers\u2019 rooms \u2013 panel shows, award shows, sketch shows, topical news shows, a chat show for a popular fake TV judge \u2026 they are all team written. Though you\u2019d be forgiven for not knowing that if you look at the credits. \u201cWriters\u201d aren\u2019t much of a thing in comedy, outside sitcoms. They are credited as \u201cprogramme associates\u201d (or \u201cadditional material\u201d). Programme associates are the modest heroes thinking of funny captions for a photo of a puffin, or writing questions about Boris Johnson\u2019s hair, or coming up with sketch ideas a talk-show host could do based round a giant papier-mache vulva that had been commissioned by the production company for another show but didn\u2019t get used. (These are all things that have happened on programmes I have written on, sorry, been associated with.) But the title may not be around for ever. The Writers\u2019 Guild of Great Britain is starting a campaign to scrap positions such as \u201cprogramme associate\u201d and credit writers for their writing. \u201cWriters should always be credited as writers,\u201d says Gail Renard, former WGGB chair and member of the guild\u2019s comedy committee, \u201cor else they stand to lose their residuals, pension contributions, and other payments they\u2019ve rightly earned. Why should we be hidden in the shadows like some dark comedy secret?\u201d Well, there\u2019s lots of reasons why comedy writers should be kept a dark dirty secret \u2013 see above \u2013 but a reluctance to give proper credit isn\u2019t one of them. \u2022 Late Night is showing in UK cinemas.",

Twelve months ago he was finishing his sevens career at the World Cup in San Francisco and now he has been part of England\u2019s training camp in Treviso and closing in on a place on the plane to Japan.</p> <p>It is a remarkable rise for the versatile back and all the more so when you consider that life off the field has been anything but straightforward. Thankfully, McConnochie was able to post in April that his partner, Vicki, was free from cancer after 18 months. \u201cIt happens,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s life. She was great through it and she\u2019s great now, she has been given the all clear. How you deal with it is all personal. It\u2019s different for different people. We have a great a support network around us and we\u2019re looking forward to the future.\u201d</p> <p>He speaks with great honesty about how quickly his rise has come, how unlikely it has been and how rapidly it could disappear. \u201cMaybe I haven\u2019t stopped and had a think about what has happened,\u201d the 27-year-old says. \u201cI\u2019ve just tried to roll with it and enjoy it because it is such a short career. A few years back I was just a fan of the game so to be able to do this as a job is incredible. Make the most of it before I have to get a real job in the real world.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/01/wales-taulupe-faletau-out-rugby-world-cup-broken-collarbone\">Wales\u2019 Taulupe Faletau out of Rugby World Cup with broken collarbone</a> </p> </aside>  <p>McConnochie\u2019s route to the senior England set-up is refreshingly unconventional. As a teenager he had come to accept that professional rugby was not for him, having been passed over at academy level. He went on a gap year to New Zealand, primarily as a teaching assistant but kept his eye in with a local club, Rangataua, before going to the University of Gloucestershire. From there, with the help of Phil Llewellyn, a university coach and former GB sevens international, he joined Nuneaton, then moved to the England sevens set-up in the spring of 2015. A feeling that he would always regret not giving XVs another crack would not stop nagging at him and with the help of Dan Cooper, who had been the England and GB sevens analyst, he moved to Bath last summer.</p> <p>\u201c[Bath] showed faith in me and offered me a contract and it was up to me to try and prove that I deserved it,\u201d he says. \u201cI knew I wanted to try and prove it but I knew it might not happen all at once. Having been out of the XVs game for three years and never been in it at that standard, I knew it could take a whole season, it could take two seasons, it might not work at all.</p> <p>\u201cI remember talking to people around August last year and just thinking that I wanted to learn the game as much as possible. I\u2019d been coming in at the end of their pre\u2011season, [the plan was to] pick up as much as I could during the season and then attack this pre-season and force through there. It didn\u2019t happen that way and here we are but I wouldn\u2019t have thought this would happen in a million years.\u201d</p> <p>McConnochie\u2019s chance with Bath came earlier than expected due to injuries and international call-ups last autumn and England began to show an interest towards the end of the season. Jones has been on the lookout for a World Cup bolter, citing the impact Nehe Milner-Skudder had for New Zealand in 2015, and on naming McConnochie in his squad this month he said: \u201cHe picked himself.

      "bodyText": "Ruaridh McConnochie\u2019s first season playing professional XVs was a whirlwind by any stretch of the imagination. Twelve months ago he was finishing his sevens career at the World Cup in San Francisco and now he has been part of England\u2019s training camp in Treviso and closing in on a place on the plane to Japan. It is a remarkable rise for the versatile back and all the more so when you consider that life off the field has been anything but straightforward. Thankfully, McConnochie was able to post in April that his partner, Vicki, was free from cancer after 18 months. \u201cIt happens,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s life. She was great through it and she\u2019s great now, she has been given the all clear. How you deal with it is all personal. It\u2019s different for different people. We have a great a support network around us and we\u2019re looking forward to the future.\u201d He speaks with great honesty about how quickly his rise has come, how unlikely it has been and how rapidly it could disappear. \u201cMaybe I haven\u2019t stopped and had a think about what has happened,\u201d the 27-year-old says. \u201cI\u2019ve just tried to roll with it and enjoy it because it is such a short career. A few years back I was just a fan of the game so to be able to do this as a job is incredible. Make the most of it before I have to get a real job in the real world.\u201d McConnochie\u2019s route to the senior England set-up is refreshingly unconventional. As a teenager he had come to accept that professional rugby was not for him, having been passed over at academy level. He went on a gap year to New Zealand, primarily as a teaching assistant but kept his eye in with a local club, Rangataua, before going to the University of Gloucestershire. From there, with the help of Phil Llewellyn, a university coach and former GB sevens international, he joined Nuneaton, then moved to the England sevens set-up in the spring of 2015. A feeling that he would always regret not giving XVs another crack would not stop nagging at him and with the help of Dan Cooper, who had been the England and GB sevens analyst, he moved to Bath last summer. \u201c[Bath] showed faith in me and offered me a contract and it was up to me to try and prove that I deserved it,\u201d he says. \u201cI knew I wanted to try and prove it but I knew it might not happen all at once. Having been out of the XVs game for three years and never been in it at that standard, I knew it could take a whole season, it could take two seasons, it might not work at all. \u201cI remember talking to people around August last year and just thinking that I wanted to learn the game as much as possible. I\u2019d been coming in at the end of their pre\u2011season, [the plan was to] pick up as much as I could during the season and then attack this pre-season and force through there. It didn\u2019t happen that way and here we are but I wouldn\u2019t have thought this would happen in a million years.\u201d McConnochie\u2019s chance with Bath came earlier than expected due to injuries and international call-ups last autumn and England began to show an interest towards the end of the season. Jones has been on the lookout for a World Cup bolter, citing the impact Nehe Milner-Skudder had for New Zealand in 2015, and on naming McConnochie in his squad this month he said: \u201cHe picked himself. He\u2019s played brilliantly for Bath. Then we delved in a bit about his background, his character, had a few meetings with him and he\u2019s a good character, good team man, ideal guy to fit in as a utility back for the World Cup. He is a handy player.\u201d High praise indeed, but McConnochie was not convinced at first when Jones tried to get in touch. \u201cI had a few chats with Bath coaches just saying England were asking questions about me, asking about my background,\u201d he says. \u201cThen on a Sunday I got a missed call from Eddie, I didn\u2019t know who it was, and a text message as well. I was, \u2018hang on, I\u2019m not sure about this\u2019. You never know with some of the boys but I checked it with one of the guys\u2019 phones. I rang him back and he said that he had been impressed with me this year and he wanted to get me involved in camp. I was a bit shocked really. Then I didn\u2019t hear anything until I started getting a few emails through and then it was 100% true, Eddie wasn\u2019t making it up.\u201d Clearly he is flourishing but after three years with England sevens, and with the Olympic rings tattooed on his right arm and a silver medal, won at Rio 2016, to show for it, McConnochie is convinced that young players would benefit from spending time on the circuit. \u201cGrowing up I was a massive Olympics fan. I remember the 2000 Games in Sydney, getting up at 4am and watching it with my brothers,\u201d he says. \u201cI used to be massively into athletics so being in an Olympic Village with all these athletes that I have watched over the years, it was incredible. \u201cIn terms of skills, more young people should be doing it. Maybe after that U20 age group because it would benefit them so much, putting their skills under pressure, as well as being in a world-class environment under massive fatigue.

      "body": "<p>After his father died, <a href=\"http://www.arambalakjian.com/post/the-house/\" title=\"\">Aram Balakjian</a> began the long job of clearing the family home. The house was large, with seven bedrooms and a cellar, and had belonged to the Balakjians for 27 years. The scale of the task overwhelmed him; both parents were artists and printmakers, with busy studios full of objects he had never been allowed to touch. His mother\u2019s death from cancer four years earlier had already triggered a career change: in the year that followed, Aram wound down his web design business to develop his passion for writing and photography, and now, as he started clearing it, he began to take pictures of the house.</p> <p>\u201cI thought, \u2018I\u2019ll never really see this again,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to capture how the house was. I wanted to get those things in my head.\u201d He knew that the process of dismantling nearly three decades of family life would be laborious and painful. He was six when the family moved into the house in north London, and the photographs were a way of securing the memories for him, his sister Tamar and any future children.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef8725e3eea23fcf7c9a371bf38841f5a9ea93ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef8725e3eea23fcf7c9a371bf38841f5a9ea93ed/0_523_7952_4771/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dorothea in the back garden in 1992, shortly after moving into the house\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dorothea in the back garden in 1992, shortly after moving into the house.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aram Balakjian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But it was hard to know where to start. The house was awash with loss. His father, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/27/marc-balakjian-obituary\" title=\"\">Marc Balakjian</a>, had died in the living room, the same room in which his mother, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/jun/10/dorothea-wight\" title=\"\">Dorothea Wight</a>, had passed away four years earlier. Together, his parents had built up the business of <a href=\"https://www.christies.com/features/The-enduring-legacy-of-Studio-Prints-9337-1.aspx\" title=\"\">Studio Prints</a>, printers to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/freud\" title=\"\">Lucian Freud</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/frank-auerbach\" title=\"\">Frank Auerbach</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/paula-rego\" title=\"\">Paula Rego</a> among others, and it took Balakjian a week, \u201cintermittently breaking down\u201d, just to sort through the papers in the room they called \u201cthe computer room\u201d. He thought, \u201cHow can we ever let go of this house?

      "bodyText": "After his father died, Aram Balakjian began the long job of clearing the family home. The house was large, with seven bedrooms and a cellar, and had belonged to the Balakjians for 27 years. The scale of the task overwhelmed him; both parents were artists and printmakers, with busy studios full of objects he had never been allowed to touch. His mother\u2019s death from cancer four years earlier had already triggered a career change: in the year that followed, Aram wound down his web design business to develop his passion for writing and photography, and now, as he started clearing it, he began to take pictures of the house. \u201cI thought, \u2018I\u2019ll never really see this again,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to capture how the house was. I wanted to get those things in my head.\u201d He knew that the process of dismantling nearly three decades of family life would be laborious and painful. He was six when the family moved into the house in north London, and the photographs were a way of securing the memories for him, his sister Tamar and any future children. But it was hard to know where to start. The house was awash with loss. His father, Marc Balakjian, had died in the living room, the same room in which his mother, Dorothea Wight, had passed away four years earlier. Together, his parents had built up the business of Studio Prints, printers to Lucian Freud, Frank Auerbach and Paula Rego among others, and it took Balakjian a week, \u201cintermittently breaking down\u201d, just to sort through the papers in the room they called \u201cthe computer room\u201d. He thought, \u201cHow can we ever let go of this house? How can this ever not be our house?\u201d Daily he was floored by \u201cemotional grenades\u201d: a diary his father kept after his mother died, his grief-stricken poems, the sheer volume of stuff, or as Balakjian puts it, \u201call these things that meant so much to someone who meant so much to you\u201d. Each one required an emotional valuation. \u201cYou\u2019re dismantling their lives. It\u2019s the end of their story. You really have this sense of what\u2019s left after we die. Just a bunch of things, really.\u201d And, of course, hundreds of family snapshots. When Balakjian had finished, he reached for his camera again, this time to photograph the empty rooms. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the house I was struggling to let go of. It was the memory of our parents, that whole life, growing up, our youthful innocence.\u201d He had the idea of juxtaposing or conflating these empty images with the ones he had taken of the house immediately after his father\u2019s death when it was still full of his parents\u2019 things, \u201cto show this weird contrast of what I experienced as I was clearing the house... this slow hacking away of emotions, and separation of them from the physical space\u201d. He held up a printed photograph of a room full of family paraphernalia, and reshot it in exactly the same place, now empty. The image, showing both the before and after in a single frame, excited him. He tried the same with one of the hundreds of family snapshots he had unearthed. \u201cThat\u2019s interesting,\u201d he thought. \u201cI can make the two images line up. It feels like looking through a window of the past.\u201d Here was the warmth of a family moment \u2013 each one raising the spectre of a lifetime of similar moments \u2013 suspended within a bright, empty room. Sometimes the inset pictures overlap with their host image; others butt up against them starkly. Still others show family moments appearing to hover in thin air. It is hard to tell which image feels more ghostly, the occupied or the unoccupied room. They haunt each other. Making the two photographs line up seamlessly, as Balakjian first intended, proved impossible. As a result, the viewer sees both the continuities and discontinuities between the spaces the two cameras captured, the parquet kinks and the wood panelling warps where the past and present meet. Bookshelves burst with books then terminate in emptiness. Flames flicker in one half of a fireplace while the neighbouring coals lie cold. The leaves of a copper beech glow burgundy, then abruptly wither. Random and bizarre episodes from years of family life are held to the light: a child (Balakjian himself) larks around the kitchen holding an orange, with a silly hairdo; his father carries a packet of flour; teenage girls, one of them Balakjian\u2019s sister, rock face masks in a stupendously carpeted bathroom. All families know their lived space by heart, but every image here ends with the same heart-wrenching dispossession. Yet for Balakjian, the process felt constructive. \u201cThe only way I could do the project was to detach myself from what I was looking at,\u201d he says. \u201cMost of the time, I didn\u2019t look at the snapshot I was holding.

There was a kind of family comedy being played out here, in which they both eagerly assumed their roles.

Simone was the worldly one, devoted to alleviating the suffering of others. In the 1930s she\u2019d burned her hands while working in a factory and offered her services in the Spanish civil war. Karen Olsson shows in her new book just how complex and deep-rooted the role-play between the siblings could be.</p> <p>Olsson is an American novelist. Her affinity with the Weils dates from her youthful obsession with maths; she took maths courses as an undergraduate at Harvard, \u201ctrekking through an abstract moonscape\u201d, and now longs for those days, missing \u201ca certain constellation of feelings\u201d that came with maths. Asked by her young son: \u201cWhere are numbers?\u201d, she thinks about the relationship between numbers and the world. This is a question that troubled Andr\u00e9, and that troubled his sister, who was desperate from childhood to understand Andr\u00e9\u2019s work but was suspicious of algebra, finding it dangerously untethered from nature.</p> <p>Olsson explores the work of both Weils, hoping to understand their shared commitment to truth. Simone \u2013 whom TS Eliot described as \u201ca kind of genius akin to that of a saint\u201d \u2013 was devoted to a religious ideal of the good. In Olsson\u2019s formulation, she used maths as something like a meditative practice, allowing it to \u201csurpass the part of brain that does math\u201d. This seems to sit oddly alongside her commitment to worldly involvement. But here again, working in the factory or, during the war, on a farm where she slept on a dirt floor, she was seeking some complicated mixture of charity and oblivion, this time through pure suffering.

Arrested during the war first (falsely) as a Russian spy in Finland and then (correctly) for avoiding military service in France, he turned his prison cell into a professorial office, and was always busy with maths. Olsson suggests that his success came in some complicated, almost unconscious way at Simone\u2019s expense: she wonders \u201cwhether his sanity somehow implicated his sister\u2019s extremity, whether in the Weil family, the two roles were divided between them: he would be the great mathematician, and she would become unhinged.\u201d It\u2019s an attractive theory, though describing Simone as unhinged feels wrong: it loses sight of the intellectual sanity that she sustained even as she apparently went mad. After all, sane protest at a crazy world might well manifest as insanity.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Uniquely among accounts of the Weils, Olsson creates a vivid sense of Simone grappling with the maths alongside us</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Olsson has taken on a complicated mix of subjects.

There were times when I longed for something more expansive, for the characters to break out of their small sections.

It\u2019s telling that when she goes into labour, chained to the bed, the camera lingers on her face and encourages us to empathise with her ordeal, rather than share the horrified viewpoint of the priest who is the film\u2019s protagonist. \u201cThe problem is not that brutal events are presented in films,\u201d says Clarke. \u201cIt\u2019s how the events are presented and where the director has chosen to place the audience\u2019s focus that matters.

Horror or violent thrillers provide ideal frameworks for female film-makers to address these themes and other issues related to women\u2019s place in society that risk being dreary turn-offs in more earnest, earthbound dramas. Couched in a genre format, though, they can operate at a visceral rather than intellectual level.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"26eea30a7ab55c1f872445a8ecaa1b346ccb5fcd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26eea30a7ab55c1f872445a8ecaa1b346ccb5fcd/0_0_2048_1365/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Slasher horror \u2026 Alice Lowe\u2019s Prevenge.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Slasher horror \u2026 Alice Lowe\u2019s Prevenge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And women\u2019s experiences can inject new blood \u2013 literally \u2013 into tired old tropes.

But where one might have expected more of a feminine twist from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/nov/25/carrie-remake-stephen-king\">Kimberly Peirce\u2019s 2013 remake</a>, additional character motivation muddies the waters. Carrie\u2019s mother gets a backstory and sympathetic performance from Julianne Moore that dilute her monstrousness. And whereas Spacek lashed out indiscriminately after being traumatised by the prom-night prank, Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz coolly murders her bullies while sparing people who have been nice to her, making the character less sympathetic, more like a telekinetic variation on a high-school shooter. In effect, the 2013 Carrie really <em>is</em> the monster her mother accused her of being.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2017/mar/13/raw-watch-a-clip-from-the-notorious-feminist-cannibal-horror-film-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/64mfy\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"3283842\"            data-video-name=\"Raw: watch a clip from the feminist cannibal horror film \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58c68c14e4b00bd41ba51704\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2017/03/13/170313RawClip_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2017/03/13/170313RawClip.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2017/03/13/170313RawClip_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2017/mar/13/raw-watch-a-clip-from-the-notorious-feminist-cannibal-horror-film-video\">Raw: watch a clip from the feminist cannibal horror film</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Other films definitely benefit from a female touch. The Woman (2011) directed by Lucky McKee (who also co-wrote it with Jack Ketchum, of The Girl Next Door notoriety), is essentially a movie about a feral woman being chained up, raped and tortured in a basement, and is every bit as harrowing and unpleasant as that summary implies, despite a vivid performance by Pollyanna McIntosh in the central role. But in the sequel, Darlin\u2019 (2019), it\u2019s McIntosh herself who not only reprises her role, but writes and directs, adding humanity, warmth and humour that were lacking in its predecessor. The feral woman\u2019s surrogate daughter is whisked away to a Catholic care home where the wild child is taught the ways of \u201ccivilisation\u201d in a coming-of-age story alternating with some traditional stalk and slash, as her \u201cmother\u201d tracks her down, dispatching a variety of disagreeable men along the way. It\u2019s a lot more fun than The Woman.</p> <p>If cinema is to survive and flourish, it must keep on presenting the world through fresh sets of eyes. The female gaze is just one way of looking at things differently. \u201cI\u2019ve made a bit of effort to consciously objectify men,\u201d says Ekl\u00f6f, who for the two leading male characters in Holiday chose actors who are \u201cattractive in a kind of conventional way.

It\u2019s telling that when she goes into labour, chained to the bed, the camera lingers on her face and encourages us to empathise with her ordeal, rather than share the horrified viewpoint of the priest who is the film\u2019s protagonist. \u201cThe problem is not that brutal events are presented in films,\u201d says Clarke. \u201cIt\u2019s how the events are presented and where the director has chosen to place the audience\u2019s focus that matters. Directors are curators of what the audience sees, hears and feels.\u201d There\u2019s still a persistent belief that violence and gore are the province of male film-makers and audiences, and Ekl\u00f6f points out that, statistically, more men than women have been involved in or subjected to violence. \u201cI think it\u2019s a very important part of the feminist movement, to speak about men\u2019s rights, not in that alt right sense, but men\u2019s liberation from toxic masculinity as well.\u201d But women naturally have an intimate relationship with blood, pain and physical transformation, which go into overdrive when menstruation leads to pregnancy and childbirth. Horror or violent thrillers provide ideal frameworks for female film-makers to address these themes and other issues related to women\u2019s place in society that risk being dreary turn-offs in more earnest, earthbound dramas. Couched in a genre format, though, they can operate at a visceral rather than intellectual level. And women\u2019s experiences can inject new blood \u2013 literally \u2013 into tired old tropes. In Prevenge (2016), Alice Lowe, directing herself in her own directorial debut while heavily pregnant, slices her way through the cast; but the horror is underpinned by physical and psychological aspects of pregnancy that no male director could ever have dreamt up on his own. Nicole Kidman is kicked in the ribs until she\u2019s black and blue in Karyn Kusama\u2019s Destroyer (2018), but her own violent behaviour is guided by her character\u2019s maternal instincts, even if she is a contender for the world\u2019s worst mother. Raw (2016), French film-maker Julia Ducournau\u2019s writing-directing debut about a vegetarian veterinary student who develops a taste for cannibalism, is awash with severed fingers and chewed-up body parts, but beneath the gore is a story about sisterhood and family ties. Sometimes, the empathy can backfire. In Brian De Palma\u2019s Carrie (1976), Sissy Spacek\u2019s poignant performance allows us to empathise with a character who might otherwise have been freakish and horrifying, and it\u2019s her mother (played by Piper Laurie) who is one of cinema\u2019s great monsters. But where one might have expected more of a feminine twist from Kimberly Peirce\u2019s 2013 remake, additional character motivation muddies the waters. Carrie\u2019s mother gets a backstory and sympathetic performance from Julianne Moore that dilute her monstrousness. And whereas Spacek lashed out indiscriminately after being traumatised by the prom-night prank, Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz coolly murders her bullies while sparing people who have been nice to her, making the character less sympathetic, more like a telekinetic variation on a high-school shooter. In effect, the 2013 Carrie really is the monster her mother accused her of being. Other films definitely benefit from a female touch. The Woman (2011) directed by Lucky McKee (who also co-wrote it with Jack Ketchum, of The Girl Next Door notoriety), is essentially a movie about a feral woman being chained up, raped and tortured in a basement, and is every bit as harrowing and unpleasant as that summary implies, despite a vivid performance by Pollyanna McIntosh in the central role. But in the sequel, Darlin\u2019 (2019), it\u2019s McIntosh herself who not only reprises her role, but writes and directs, adding humanity, warmth and humour that were lacking in its predecessor. The feral woman\u2019s surrogate daughter is whisked away to a Catholic care home where the wild child is taught the ways of \u201ccivilisation\u201d in a coming-of-age story alternating with some traditional stalk and slash, as her \u201cmother\u201d tracks her down, dispatching a variety of disagreeable men along the way. It\u2019s a lot more fun than The Woman. If cinema is to survive and flourish, it must keep on presenting the world through fresh sets of eyes. The female gaze is just one way of looking at things differently. \u201cI\u2019ve made a bit of effort to consciously objectify men,\u201d says Ekl\u00f6f, who for the two leading male characters in Holiday chose actors who are \u201cattractive in a kind of conventional way. I\u2019ve taken the role of femme fatale versus the good girl, and reversed that dynamic.\u201d Meanwhile, horror fans are looking forward to seeing what effect the female gaze will have on David Cronenberg\u2019s body horror classic Rabid (1977), in which a motorbike accident leaves its anti-heroine with a phallic implant in her armpit and an uncontrollable bloodthirst allied to a virus that turns her victims into zombie-like berserkers. The Soska sisters\u2019 remake is on its way. \u2022Holiday is released on 2 August in the UK, with a Q&amp;A with Isabella Ekl\u00f6f at the ICA, London, on 6 August",

The cell-like formation of caste groups continues, though it is giving way to modern heterogeneity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc5810e72aa552a59493958f099e9f3c1f90259f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc5810e72aa552a59493958f099e9f3c1f90259f/0_0_4287_5303/808.jpg\" alt=\"Pune by Saurabh Agashe\" width=\"808\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>As you drift into the lanes at the risk of getting lost in nostalgia, you find more interesting buildings that clearly shout out \u201cheritage\u201d. Not only are there <em>wadas</em> (traditional mansions), but also multi-storied buildings from the colonial era that adorn the narrow streets on both sides. Previously lavish residences for British officials, these buildings now are often devoted to commercial enterprises, but even so remain architectural marvels; some crumbling, some still standing tall.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e6c10673535e94c9f33804a8d87d15a00cdf68d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6c10673535e94c9f33804a8d87d15a00cdf68d9/0_0_4469_4864/919.jpg\" alt=\"Pune by Saurabh Agashe\" width=\"919\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The balconies proudly display intricate woodwork on their railings, while tinted glass windows reflect rainbow colours when sunlight falls on them.

This was reflected in the townscape too. There were no grand avenues, monumental buildings or ornate palaces. But the development of the <em>wada</em> as a house form reached its climax in Peshwai Pune and gave the cityscape a distinctive architectural character.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"36f228634ac3ba8d8b147550c03cee5033454c01\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36f228634ac3ba8d8b147550c03cee5033454c01/0_0_4606_5171/891.jpg\" alt=\"Pune by Saurabh Agashe\" width=\"891\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Though it might seem chaotic, these narrow lanes and clustered complexes are actually more organised than the planned settlements we have today.

They have been named on the basis of the trade that they carried out: Burud Ali (cane), Kumbhar Ali (potters), Tambat Ali (coppersmiths), etc.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a0f16da9c47ee041f839d564cae9ac18d4eacb9f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0f16da9c47ee041f839d564cae9ac18d4eacb9f/0_0_4576_6328/723.jpg\" alt=\"Pune by Saurabh Agashe\" width=\"723\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>During the Peshwa period the rulers invited people from various areas who had specialised skills to come and settle in Pune.</p> <p>As a result of this many professionals who were not Maharashtrian came and settled in the city.

      "bodyText": "Urbanisation and globalisation have swept sleepy Pune off its feet. This city in Maharashtra, western India, is growing by the day \u2013 and much has changed for this small, old, town of pensioners. While skyscrapers go up in the city, there\u2019 still a slice of the past that remains rooted in the old town\u2019s by-lanes, although there are few traces of the old times. There\u2019s change happening everywhere, yet there are some proud owners of century-old (or even older) properties who are striving to preserve the traditional buildings. Walk down the lanes of the old city and you\u2019ll find these structures \u2013 and the people who have held them dear for years. The cell-like formation of caste groups continues, though it is giving way to modern heterogeneity. As you drift into the lanes at the risk of getting lost in nostalgia, you find more interesting buildings that clearly shout out \u201cheritage\u201d. Not only are there wadas (traditional mansions), but also multi-storied buildings from the colonial era that adorn the narrow streets on both sides. Previously lavish residences for British officials, these buildings now are often devoted to commercial enterprises, but even so remain architectural marvels; some crumbling, some still standing tall. The balconies proudly display intricate woodwork on their railings, while tinted glass windows reflect rainbow colours when sunlight falls on them. In these rapidly changing times, the labyrinthine by-lanes of Pune\u2019s Peth area continue to retain their old city charm. The life-style of the upper class was spartan and austere. This was reflected in the townscape too. There were no grand avenues, monumental buildings or ornate palaces. But the development of the wada as a house form reached its climax in Peshwai Pune and gave the cityscape a distinctive architectural character. Though it might seem chaotic, these narrow lanes and clustered complexes are actually more organised than the planned settlements we have today. With all the right and bright colours, they radiate a unique texture or earthy tones characteristic of old Pune city. The past also confronts us in the city\u2019s many temples. They comprised an important and crucial part of the city\u2019s public places. These temples structured the community and formed a physical and social bond. A paar is a platform built around a venerable tree with a small shrine under it. Even the most congested of cities people have always found a way to ferret out small open spaces for social interactions. It may be a little cul-de-sac at the end of the lane, a little bulge to a winding street space between houses or culverts and other nooks. The paars have stood the test of time and new ones keep cropping up in the newer parts of the city. There are also a number of trees in the Peth areas as old or even older then some of the wadas. Of great antiquity, these acquire a special place in the old city along with a lot of fables attached to them. Today enveloped within the bustling city, they represent continuity amidst change. Glimpses of the old medieval town can be caught, and history relived, as we walk through these chaotic lanes, cool even under the midday sun. Though most people no longer follow the caste professions, there are still some craftsmen who reside in the interior core of the city. Pune had a distinct social pattern of \u201cAlis\u201d. An Ali is a street, or group of streets, inhibited by people of one community pursuing one trade. They have been named on the basis of the trade that they carried out: Burud Ali (cane), Kumbhar Ali (potters), Tambat Ali (coppersmiths), etc. During the Peshwa period the rulers invited people from various areas who had specialised skills to come and settle in Pune. As a result of this many professionals who were not Maharashtrian came and settled in the city. Alis formed the places where these groups stayed together and carried out their trade and commerce. These micro units over a period of time have now merged with the whole city\u2019s development leaving a distant memory. Built during the zenith of Peshwa rule in Pune, the Ram Mandir (temple) at Tulsibaug is one of the few places which has survived in an almost intact form even after years. Located in the heart of the city, its main features are a historic temple precinct and a large market. At that time when it was named, the place used to be a flourishing garden filled with the fragrance of basil. Hence, Tulshi (Basil) Baug (Garden). Though the neighbourhood has changed dramatically, Tulsibaug Wada, where the temple is located, has remained like a cherished treasure and a visit to this temple literally takes you back in time. Tulsibaug, with its array of shops splattered all around and a few heritage temples, is both a commercial hub as well a cultural hub with a vintage feel. The British era also brought development to the western bank of the Mutha River, in the vicinity of the village of Bhamburde (now Shivajinagar). The Deccan Gymkhana Post Office, established in 1923, saw the communication links with the rest of the towns under British Raj completed. With the area offering a post office, a sports club, a tennis court, a vegetable market and other civic amenities, it became a much sought after residential locality. It was now that Pune acquired an image which firmly linked it to the typical image of the British Raj. The town acquiring a duality: a traditional Indian city with its jostling crowds and narrow lanes and vibrant \u201cdisorderliness\u201d, contrasted with a British colonial settlement, a suburb for the elite. Although the city has slowly transformed, the Deccan Gymkhana Post Office still functions just as it did in the colonial era. Holding history and utility in both hands is Mahatma Phule Mandai (a mandai is a market), or simply Mandai, as Punekars lovingly call it. Mahatma Phule Mandai (formerly Reay Market) is the biggest vegetable market in Pune City. Located in Shukrawar Peth, it is a major landmark. With eight entrances and a prominent octagonal tower, the construction of the gothic-style building began in 1882 and was completed in 1886. Originally named after the then governor of Bombay, Lord Reay, Mandai served as a retail and wholesale market. Post-independence it was renamed Mahatma Phule Market, after Pune\u2019s social reformer Mahatma Phule. Today, there are more than 520 stalls of fruits and vegetables. Although an old part of the city\u2019s heritage, the importance of Mandai will always be a British era relic for the Punekars. Today with the spread of the suburbs, the inner city has been neglected. The old residential cores have a distinct look of typical urban blight. The opportunity to create a coherent urban form linking the everyday the life of Puneites and their traditions seems to be slipping by. All is not lost, however.

Wall Street falls late on Thursday were followed by a sharp drop in Asian share prices on Friday morning, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/01/trump-china-tariffs-retailers\">retailers warned that the president\u2019s \u201cflawed strategy\u201d</a> was already acting as a drag on economic growth.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Broken promises.</strong> Trump said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1156979443900067841\">on Twitter</a> that the new tariffs were a response to China reneging on several of its promises, which he had previously touted as progress in negotiations between the two economic superpowers.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Heatwaves drive near-record ice melt in northern hemisphere</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0df23e4bf567656295b0a5edda4917a0a061fd05\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0df23e4bf567656295b0a5edda4917a0a061fd05/0_0_4902_2943/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An iceberg floats near the seashore of King\u2019s Point in Newfoundland, Canada.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An iceberg floats near the seashore of King\u2019s Point in Newfoundland, Canada.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The biggest ice sheet in the northern hemisphere is likely to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/02/heatwaves-amplify-near-record-levels-of-ice-melt-in-northern-hemisphere\">shrunk more in the past month</a> than in an entire average year, as a series of summer heatwaves have sparked forest fires in Siberia and sent glaciers into retreat across Europe.

The briefing is taking a short summer break next week, but will return to your inbox on 12 August. US retailers line up against administration\u2019s new China tariffs The global markets have taken a tumble after Donald Trump unexpectedly announced on Thursday a fresh escalation in his administration\u2019s trade war with China, threatening to slap tariffs on a further $300bn of Chinese goods in September. Wall Street falls late on Thursday were followed by a sharp drop in Asian share prices on Friday morning, while retailers warned that the president\u2019s \u201cflawed strategy\u201d was already acting as a drag on economic growth. Broken promises. Trump said on Twitter that the new tariffs were a response to China reneging on several of its promises, which he had previously touted as progress in negotiations between the two economic superpowers. Heatwaves drive near-record ice melt in northern hemisphere The biggest ice sheet in the northern hemisphere is likely to have shrunk more in the past month than in an entire average year, as a series of summer heatwaves have sparked forest fires in Siberia and sent glaciers into retreat across Europe. Greenland\u2019s ice sheet is second only to Antarctica in size; in July, say experts, it shed the equivalent of 80m Olympic swimming pools in surface ice. Melt season. With more than a month of the melt season still to go, 2019 is already one of the top 10 years for ice loss in Greenland, although the extent of the melt is considered unlikely to beat the record set in 2012. 17m Americans purged from voter rolls since 2016 A 2013 supreme court decision that freed counties with histories of voter discrimination from federal oversight has led to an alarmingly rapid purge of voter rolls, according to a study by the Brennan Center for Justice. At least 17 million voters were struck from the rolls nationwide between 2016 and 2018, the study found: a number similar to the previous two-year period. Yet election jurisdictions with a record of egregious voter discrimination have been purging their rolls at a rate 40% higher than the national average. Voting Rights Act. The supreme court\u2019s Shelby County v Holder ruling in 2013 released historically discriminatory counties from the federal oversight that had previously been enshrined by the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Will Hurd, lone black House Republican, to retire in 2020 Congressman Will Hurd, the only black House Republican and one of the party\u2019s rare remaining Trump critics, has announced he will not seek re-election to his Texas seat in 2020. Hurd is one of many Republicans to have announced his retirement in recent weeks, and his departure deals a blow to the GOP \u2013 and not merely by diminishing its diversity. The former CIA officer only just clung to his seat at last year\u2019s midterms, making it a key target for Democrats in 2020. House resolution. Hurd was one of just four Republicans to vote for a House resolution condemning Trump\u2019s suggestion that the four congresswomen known as The Squad should \u201cgo back\u201d to their home countries. Three of the four were born in the US. Ilhan Omar. The fourth, Ilhan Omar, was born in Somalia. On Thursday, she posted a photograph on Instagram of herself with Speaker Nancy Pelosi on a congressional trip to Ghana, another African country, with the caption: \u201cShe went back with me.\u201d Crib sheet Robert F Kennedy\u2019s granddaughter, Saiorse Kennedy Hill, has died aged 22, her family announced on Thursday. Hill was the daughter of Robert and Ethel Kennedy\u2019s fifth child, Courtney, and Paul Hill, who was falsely convicted of a 1974 IRA bombing. Scientists at the Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis say they have developed a blood test that predicts the onset of Alzheimer\u2019s up to 20 years before the disease\u2019s debilitating symptoms become apparent. The US defense department is reviewing the bid process for the military\u2019s $10bn cloud-computing contract, after Trump echoed criticisms from competitors that the process is potentially biased towards Amazon. Shin Ok-ju, the founder of the South Korean Grace Road Church cult, who persuaded 400 of her followers to decamp to Fiji, where she held them captive and subjected them to violent beatings, has been sentenced to six years in jail. Must-reads The climate change protesters taking down Macron (literally) French climate change protesters are taking an unusual but eye-catching approach to civil disobedience: removing framed portraits of President Macron from more than 100 town halls the length and breadth of the country. Angelique Chrisafis reports from Paris. How we became suckers for self-optimisation Today\u2019s \u201cideal woman\u201d uses Instagram to flaunt an optimised lifestyle of athleisure and kale to which her peers are compelled to aspire.

Now she\u2019s a private investigator, whose cases include embezzlers, drug mules \u2013 and even the occasional lost teddy bear. Trump campaign targets Latinx voters in Florida Donald Trump may have routinely disparaged Hispanic immigrants, but his campaign team believes conservative Latinx voters in Florida could hold the key to his re-election in 2020. And Democrats fear they may be right, as Sabrina Siddiqui discovers. Opinion This week\u2019s televised debates have still not provided a solution to the Democrats\u2019 biggest dilemma, says Geoffrey Kabaservice: do they win by swinging left, or by clinging to the moderate centre? The moderates, by and large, are concerned not only with practicality but also with restoring the sense of national unity shredded by Trump, while the progressives call for fighting fire with fire.

And it could have disastrous consequences.\u201d</p> <p>The EU27 will give little, if any, ground on the withdrawal agreement, he said, and the costs of no deal are many times greater for the UK than for the EU. \u201cSo I can see only one reason Johnson might pursue it. A cynical, dark reason: new elections, to win a new mandate - putting party before country, at a truly existential moment.\u201d</p> <p>Another lifelong anglophile, Andr\u00e9 Gattolin, the vice-president of the French senate\u2019s European affairs committee, said the new prime minister had carefully cultivated a \u201ccaricatural image \u2013 the hair, the gags, the flags, the zip-wire, the provocations\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f1bd765b41e5b80a688a5d53488e57d71fabf790\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1bd765b41e5b80a688a5d53488e57d71fabf790/606_71_2757_1654/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson stuck on a zip-wire\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A carefully cultivated caricatural image\u2019: Boris Johnson stuck on a zip-wire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Barcroft Media</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But behind the clownish persona was \u201ca very smart strategist: after all, he\u2019s in power, and he got there from inside the traditional structures. Yes, he has precious little room for manoeuvre and he\u2019s soon going to run into reality; he\u2019ll have to reach an accommodation, find something he can present as a victory.\u201d</p> <p>But his very presence in No 10 showed Johnson was not the bumbler the continental media like to portray him as, Gattolin said, adding: \u201cHe pretends he\u2019s a bull in a china shop \u2013 but he knew how to get in, by the front door. He\u2019s playing a game, and thus far you\u2019d have to say he\u2019s playing it pretty well.\u201d</p> <p>Some have direct \u2013 and chastening \u2013 experience of Johnson\u2019s games. Martin Ehl\u2019s 15-minute interview in November 2016 with the then foreign secretary won him brief international fame after Johnson was quoted dismissing as \u201cbollocks\u201d the notion that freedom of movement was a fundamental EU value.</p> <p>Downing Street soon suggested Johnson had been misquoted \u2013 even though Ehl\u2019s newspaper, Hospod\u00e1\u0159sk\u00e9 noviny, had agreed to the British embassy checking the interview before publication. The Czech paper posted <a href=\"https://zahranicni.ihned.cz/c1-65521570-ostre-vyroky-borise-johnsona-v-hn-vyvolaly-v-britanii-rozruch-poslechnete-si-jejich-originalni-zneni\">a recording of the interview on its website</a> in which the offending expression is clearly audible, plus the words: \u201cYou can translate bollocks into Czech.\u201d</p> <p>Ehl said Johnson was \u201ca politician and he does what he thinks is best for him\u201d. Ehl said he had no problem with that, \u201cbut I do have a problem with someone trying to undermine our honesty and dignity \u2026 I saw in him a professional politician who knew he was talking to a journalist and that he had to say something that would resonate and make a good headline. But he wasn\u2019t so careful.\u201d</p> <p>Pascal Boniface, the director of the French Institute for International and Strategic Affairs, agreed it was as much of a mistake for the French to mock Johnson as it was for them to laugh at Donald Trump. \u201cWe sit here jeering at them, and meanwhile they get on with putting their plans into action,\u201d he said.</p> <p>There were clearly similarities between the two leaders, Boniface said: both lead from the front, taking few hostages; both are opportunists, guided more by public opinion than any fixed ideology. But as far as Europe was concerned, he added, Johnson\u2019s biggest problem was that the UK is not the US.</p> <p>\u201cThe European reflex is still to show some deference to the US,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the EU27 will not scrap the deal for Britain. The shock of reality will be brutal for Johnson \u2013 he may conceivably frighten Conservative MPs into backing him in parliament, but he won\u2019t budge the EU.\u201d</p> <p>Italy\u2019s former state secretary for European affairs Sandro Gozi now a Europe adviser to the French government, said Johnson was \u201ca man who has changed his mind about quite a lot of things\u201d, but had been \u201cutterly consistent on Europe as prime minister: Britain must leave on 31 October. Well, we must respect that \u2013 but the question is, how will Britain leave? We await his proposal. The ball is in his court. A hard Brexit will be his choice.\u201d</p> <p>Reality is waiting in the wings, agreed Salvatore Margiotta, an MP with the Democratic party. Johnson is \u201ca poker player who will now have to reveal his bluff\u201d, he said. \u201cWe are facing a farce, a sort of Brexit fake. A no deal would have dramatic consequences, especially for the UK \u2013 and Johnson, who is prejudiced but not foolish, knows this.\u201d</p> <p>Ulrike Herrmann, economics commentator for the leftwing German daily Taz, concurred. It would be \u201cintriguing to see when and how Boris Johnson effects his about-turn. Because he has a pragmatic relationship to power,\u201d she said. \u201cHe became PM by posing as a hardliner. Long-term, though, he can only stay in this office if he says goodbye to a hard Brexit.\u201d</p> <p>Gabriel Felbermayr, the president of the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, suggested it would soon become clear whether Johnson really had a plan, but \u201cwith his provocative style, he is certainly not the person to build a bridge between his country, at odds with itself, and Brussels\u201d.</p> <p>Markus Becker, Spiegel\u2019s Brussels correspondent, wondered whether Johnson was \u201csimply going to let it come to no deal \u2013 in the hope that he will, as usual, be able to withdraw himself from the affair with a mix of chutzpah, charm and luck, and then pass the blame for the mess on to someone else\u201d.</p> <p>Bild\u2019s lead opinion writer, Franz Josef Wagner, said Johnson had sprung from Britain\u2019s \u201cblack and quirky\u201d sense of humour: Mr Bean, Monty Python, anti-German jokes. \u201cWhen things are bad in England, people laugh rather than complain about it,\u201d he said. \u201cI only hope they can continue to laugh under Boris Johnson.\u201d</p> <p>Some certainly doubt that. The Nobel literature laureate Mario Vargas Llosa, who lives in Spain, recently called Boris Johnson \u201ca liar and a clown\u201d and warned that he posed a threat to \u201cBritain\u2019s progress, civilisation and culture\u201d.</p> <p>But Carles Casajuana, who was Spain\u2019s ambassador to the UK between 2008 and 2012 and met Johnson when he was mayor of London, recalled a \u201cvery intelligent, very nice\u201d person. That was hidden, though, he said, behind an \u201cair of frivolity: deep down, I think he\u2019s much more calculating than he wants to show.\u201d</p> <p>Berta Herrero, a journalist specialising in the EU, said Spaniards tended to see Johnson as \u201ckind of kamikaze\u201d, and very loose on the facts. \u201cHe\u2019s seen as reckless; as someone who has built a career on lying and convincing people of what\u2019s on his mind: of his fantasies, not necessarily of the truth or the facts,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is trying to copy Trump, but is more like his little brother.\u201d</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Robert Tait in Prague, Sam Jones in Madrid, Kate Connolly in Berlin and Angela Giuffrida in Rome</em></p>",

And it could have disastrous consequences.\u201d The EU27 will give little, if any, ground on the withdrawal agreement, he said, and the costs of no deal are many times greater for the UK than for the EU. \u201cSo I can see only one reason Johnson might pursue it. A cynical, dark reason: new elections, to win a new mandate - putting party before country, at a truly existential moment.\u201d Another lifelong anglophile, Andr\u00e9 Gattolin, the vice-president of the French senate\u2019s European affairs committee, said the new prime minister had carefully cultivated a \u201ccaricatural image \u2013 the hair, the gags, the flags, the zip-wire, the provocations\u201d. But behind the clownish persona was \u201ca very smart strategist: after all, he\u2019s in power, and he got there from inside the traditional structures. Yes, he has precious little room for manoeuvre and he\u2019s soon going to run into reality; he\u2019ll have to reach an accommodation, find something he can present as a victory.\u201d But his very presence in No 10 showed Johnson was not the bumbler the continental media like to portray him as, Gattolin said, adding: \u201cHe pretends he\u2019s a bull in a china shop \u2013 but he knew how to get in, by the front door. He\u2019s playing a game, and thus far you\u2019d have to say he\u2019s playing it pretty well.\u201d Some have direct \u2013 and chastening \u2013 experience of Johnson\u2019s games. Martin Ehl\u2019s 15-minute interview in November 2016 with the then foreign secretary won him brief international fame after Johnson was quoted dismissing as \u201cbollocks\u201d the notion that freedom of movement was a fundamental EU value. Downing Street soon suggested Johnson had been misquoted \u2013 even though Ehl\u2019s newspaper, Hospod\u00e1\u0159sk\u00e9 noviny, had agreed to the British embassy checking the interview before publication. The Czech paper posted a recording of the interview on its website in which the offending expression is clearly audible, plus the words: \u201cYou can translate bollocks into Czech.\u201d Ehl said Johnson was \u201ca politician and he does what he thinks is best for him\u201d. Ehl said he had no problem with that, \u201cbut I do have a problem with someone trying to undermine our honesty and dignity \u2026 I saw in him a professional politician who knew he was talking to a journalist and that he had to say something that would resonate and make a good headline. But he wasn\u2019t so careful.\u201d Pascal Boniface, the director of the French Institute for International and Strategic Affairs, agreed it was as much of a mistake for the French to mock Johnson as it was for them to laugh at Donald Trump. \u201cWe sit here jeering at them, and meanwhile they get on with putting their plans into action,\u201d he said. There were clearly similarities between the two leaders, Boniface said: both lead from the front, taking few hostages; both are opportunists, guided more by public opinion than any fixed ideology. But as far as Europe was concerned, he added, Johnson\u2019s biggest problem was that the UK is not the US. \u201cThe European reflex is still to show some deference to the US,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the EU27 will not scrap the deal for Britain. The shock of reality will be brutal for Johnson \u2013 he may conceivably frighten Conservative MPs into backing him in parliament, but he won\u2019t budge the EU.\u201d Italy\u2019s former state secretary for European affairs Sandro Gozi now a Europe adviser to the French government, said Johnson was \u201ca man who has changed his mind about quite a lot of things\u201d, but had been \u201cutterly consistent on Europe as prime minister: Britain must leave on 31 October. Well, we must respect that \u2013 but the question is, how will Britain leave? We await his proposal. The ball is in his court. A hard Brexit will be his choice.\u201d Reality is waiting in the wings, agreed Salvatore Margiotta, an MP with the Democratic party. Johnson is \u201ca poker player who will now have to reveal his bluff\u201d, he said. \u201cWe are facing a farce, a sort of Brexit fake. A no deal would have dramatic consequences, especially for the UK \u2013 and Johnson, who is prejudiced but not foolish, knows this.\u201d Ulrike Herrmann, economics commentator for the leftwing German daily Taz, concurred. It would be \u201cintriguing to see when and how Boris Johnson effects his about-turn. Because he has a pragmatic relationship to power,\u201d she said. \u201cHe became PM by posing as a hardliner. Long-term, though, he can only stay in this office if he says goodbye to a hard Brexit.\u201d Gabriel Felbermayr, the president of the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, suggested it would soon become clear whether Johnson really had a plan, but \u201cwith his provocative style, he is certainly not the person to build a bridge between his country, at odds with itself, and Brussels\u201d. Markus Becker, Spiegel\u2019s Brussels correspondent, wondered whether Johnson was \u201csimply going to let it come to no deal \u2013 in the hope that he will, as usual, be able to withdraw himself from the affair with a mix of chutzpah, charm and luck, and then pass the blame for the mess on to someone else\u201d. Bild\u2019s lead opinion writer, Franz Josef Wagner, said Johnson had sprung from Britain\u2019s \u201cblack and quirky\u201d sense of humour: Mr Bean, Monty Python, anti-German jokes. \u201cWhen things are bad in England, people laugh rather than complain about it,\u201d he said. \u201cI only hope they can continue to laugh under Boris Johnson.\u201d Some certainly doubt that. The Nobel literature laureate Mario Vargas Llosa, who lives in Spain, recently called Boris Johnson \u201ca liar and a clown\u201d and warned that he posed a threat to \u201cBritain\u2019s progress, civilisation and culture\u201d. But Carles Casajuana, who was Spain\u2019s ambassador to the UK between 2008 and 2012 and met Johnson when he was mayor of London, recalled a \u201cvery intelligent, very nice\u201d person. That was hidden, though, he said, behind an \u201cair of frivolity: deep down, I think he\u2019s much more calculating than he wants to show.\u201d Berta Herrero, a journalist specialising in the EU, said Spaniards tended to see Johnson as \u201ckind of kamikaze\u201d, and very loose on the facts. \u201cHe\u2019s seen as reckless; as someone who has built a career on lying and convincing people of what\u2019s on his mind: of his fantasies, not necessarily of the truth or the facts,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is trying to copy Trump, but is more like his little brother.\u201d Additional reporting by Robert Tait in Prague, Sam Jones in Madrid, Kate Connolly in Berlin and Angela Giuffrida in Rome",

The Apple Watch was particularly susceptible to such accidental triggers, they said. \u201cThe regularity of accidental triggers on the watch is incredibly high \u2026 The watch can record some snippets that will be 30 seconds \u2013 not that long, but you can gather a good idea of what\u2019s going on.</p> <p>Sometimes, the Apple contractor said, \u201cyou can definitely hear a doctor and patient, talking about the medical history of the patient.

The current iOS does not allow users to opt out of face recognition on photos, and this revelation about Siri means our iPhones were listening to us without our knowledge.\u201d</p> <p>The company is not alone in taking flak for its undisclosed quality assurance programmes. Both Amazon and Google also use contractors to check the quality of their voice assistants, according to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-10/is-anyone-listening-to-you-on-alexa-a-global-team-reviews-audio\">reports in Bloomberg</a> and on the <a href=\"https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/en/2019/07/10/google-employees-are-eavesdropping-even-in-flemish-living-rooms/\">Belgian TV channel VRT</a>, and contractors from both companies have expressed discomfort at the nature of overheard recordings.</p> <p>The revelation of Google\u2019s programme in particular caused concern due to the fact the news report was accompanied by a leak of more than 1,000 audio clips, revealing that at least one in 10 had been captured accidentally.</p> <p>That prompted the data protection commissioner for Hamburg in Germany to ban Google from carrying out those checks for three months, citing a likely breach of the general data protection regulation (GDPR). The commissioner cited an \u201curgent need to protect the rights and freedoms\u201d of Google Home users in enacting the temporary ban, which would otherwise be the responsibility of the Irish data protection commissioner, the lead controller for Google, as well as Apple, in the EU. Google says it had already ceased the practice on 10 July, when it learned about the leak of audio clips.</p> <p>Amazon and Apple escaped the ban, Hamburg\u2019s commissioner said, because those companies have their German head offices in Munich and are thus covered by a different commissioner under that country\u2019s privacy laws. But the commissioner called on other regulators to \u201cquickly check for other providers of language assistance systems, such as Apple or Amazon, to implement appropriate measures\u201d.</p> <p>Amazon is the only major provider of voice assistant technology still using humans to check recordings in the EU.</p>",

Or you\u2019d hear someone, maybe with car engine background noise \u2013 you can\u2019t say definitely, but it\u2019s a drug deal \u2026 you can definitely hear it happening. And you\u2019d hear, like, people engaging in sexual acts that are accidentally recorded on the pod or the watch.\u201d Although Apple told users that Siri data may be used \u201cto help Siri \u2026 understand you better and recognise what you say\u201d, the company did not explicitly disclose that this entailed human contractors listening to a random selection of Siri recordings, including those triggered accidentally. \u201cToo often we see that so-called \u2018smart assistants\u2019 are in fact eavesdropping, said Silkie Carlo, the director of the UK campaign group Big Brother Watch. \u201cWe also see that they often collect and use people\u2019s personal information in ways that people do not know about and cannot control.\u201d She added: \u201cApple\u2019s record on privacy is really slipping. The current iOS does not allow users to opt out of face recognition on photos, and this revelation about Siri means our iPhones were listening to us without our knowledge.\u201d The company is not alone in taking flak for its undisclosed quality assurance programmes. Both Amazon and Google also use contractors to check the quality of their voice assistants, according to reports in Bloomberg and on the Belgian TV channel VRT, and contractors from both companies have expressed discomfort at the nature of overheard recordings. The revelation of Google\u2019s programme in particular caused concern due to the fact the news report was accompanied by a leak of more than 1,000 audio clips, revealing that at least one in 10 had been captured accidentally. That prompted the data protection commissioner for Hamburg in Germany to ban Google from carrying out those checks for three months, citing a likely breach of the general data protection regulation (GDPR). The commissioner cited an \u201curgent need to protect the rights and freedoms\u201d of Google Home users in enacting the temporary ban, which would otherwise be the responsibility of the Irish data protection commissioner, the lead controller for Google, as well as Apple, in the EU. Google says it had already ceased the practice on 10 July, when it learned about the leak of audio clips. Amazon and Apple escaped the ban, Hamburg\u2019s commissioner said, because those companies have their German head offices in Munich and are thus covered by a different commissioner under that country\u2019s privacy laws. But the commissioner called on other regulators to \u201cquickly check for other providers of language assistance systems, such as Apple or Amazon, to implement appropriate measures\u201d. Amazon is the only major provider of voice assistant technology still using humans to check recordings in the EU.",

After years of argument over the project, a crane attached to a barge was deployed from 6am on Friday morning to take apart the three arches of the Pont des Trous as a local cellist played mournfully on the river bank. The bridge\u2019s bricks will be retained for its later reconstruction on similar lines to the original, albeit with a wider and higher central arch. The council had initially supported a contemporary replacement described by opponents as a \u201cBridge of McDonald\u2019s\u201d due to its similarity to the burger chain\u2019s logo, and officials have been criticised for their willingness to dismantle the landmark. A crowd on the river\u2019s banks audibly reacted when some of the brickwork was seen falling into the water on Friday. Many watching a live stream on the website of the regional television station, Notele, wrote of their sadness at saying \u201cgoodbye\u201d.

And is it addictive?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Although Fortnite is a multiplayer shooter, it does not depict bloody violence. It takes lots of enjoyable gameplay concepts from more mature shooting games but places them in a non-threatening, non-realistic world. In terms of addictiveness, Fortnite contains nothing that makes it different from other action video games. It's more that the game contains many different elements \u2013 nice visuals, good shooting mechanics, an interesting building component and lots of support and interest from YouTubers \u2013 into one package that is free to download.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Crucially, fans could watch on consoles, phones, laptops or tablets by choosing their own streaming services \u2013 there was no restriction to one format or provider, such as with Sky or BT Sport.

She is a truly modern sports star: an outspoken digital native with something to say other than: \u201cI\u2019m over the moon, the lads have done great.\u201d By mixing in star YouTubers such as Ninja and ONE_shot_GURL with young competitors and a lot of cosplay and hints about the forthcoming season 10, the Fortnite World Cup had the welcoming feel of a well-run fan event rather than a standoffish global sporting occasion. It was entertaining and exciting but also interactive and a bit goofy. The matches were brilliantly directed to help viewers keep track of the action and key rivalries amid the chaos of 100 people fighting on a large map. There was much to take away, both about how esports will work going forward and about what traditional sports providers will need to do if they want to reach millennial and generation Z viewers who lapped up this exuberant event.",

The men\u2019s coach, Wayne Ellaway, still came off smiling, especially after Wales grabbed a last-minute consolation goal. \u201cThat gave the crowd something to cheer,\u201d he said. Ellaway admits to having lived a troubled life but his fortunes have been turned round by playing for and now coaching the Wales team. \u201cThis is a way of trying to make amends to my family, friends and community for the pain I have put them through.\u201d He said he saw vulnerable people changing into proud adults as they trained and competed. \u201cThe change is phenomenal,\u201d he said. The venue, Bute Park, is particularly poignant for Ellaway. This was one of the spots he used to pass the time at his lowest point. \u201cI used to walk around this place in despair, not knowing where to go, what to do. Now I\u2019m coaching Wales here \u2013 it\u2019s amazing.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "An RAF Chinook helicopter is dropping off 400 tonnes of aggregate to help shore up a reservoir at risk of collapse, threatening to engulf a Derbyshire town. More than a thousand residents of Whaley Bridge, on the edge of the Peak District, had to leave their homes on Thursday in a mass evacuation. Many have been told they may not be able to return for several days after damage to the dam wall of Toddbrook reservoir, which sits high above the town and contains about 1.3m tonnes of water. Engineers have been pumping water out of the reservoir after part of a dam wall collapsed following extreme rainfall. They have managed to reduce water levels by 200mm, aided by a mostly dry night in the Goyt valley, which runs from Buxton to Whaley through to Stockport.

There\u2019s no way I could pay to be here for two weeks \u2013 live in a flat, eat, and buy tickets to see shows \u2013 it\u2019d be impossible. If you push out your average punter, then all it is is a glorified industry showcase.\u201d</p> <p>This year there has been <a href=\"https://www.umega.co.uk/blog/edinburgh-rental-market-update-q1-2019/\">a 5% rise</a> in Edinburgh rents, and prices go up sharply during the month-long festival, which brings an estimated <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-scotland-36894083/edinburgh-s-festivals-worth-300m-to-scottish-economy\">\u00a3300m to the Scottish economy</a>. Some of that increase has been attributed to the introduction of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/01/tenancy-overhaul-in-scotland-hailed-new-dawn-private-renters-housing-landlords\">private </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/01/tenancy-overhaul-in-scotland-hailed-new-dawn-private-renters-housing-landlords\">residential </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/01/tenancy-overhaul-in-scotland-hailed-new-dawn-private-renters-housing-landlords\">tenancy</a> (PRT) in Scotland, which replaced short assured tenancy in December 2017. Traditionally, student lets would be over a fixed term, which would allow landlords to rent out properties during the festival. With PRT, landlords cannot ask a tenant to leave without a reason.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/02/edinburgh-fringe-climate-crisis-shows\">Eco-venues and no-flyer zones: Edinburgh fringe tackles the climate crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Louise Dickins, the managing director of Edinburgh lettings agency Dickins, said landlords would traditionally write to student tenants in January to ask whether they intended to remain in the property or leave in May after their exams, allowing them to plan for a potential festival let. But PRT rules mean tenants only need to give a month\u2019s notice, with many students confirming they are leaving only at the beginning of May. </p> <p>She said <a href=\"https://www.chortle.co.uk/correspondents/2019/07/11/43547/why_edinburgh_fringe_rents_are_spiralling\">an unintended consequence</a> of PRT was that it had taken hundreds of properties off the market during August, which has in turn pushed prices up further. \u201cThe impact has been major,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the fact leases don\u2019t have end dates. They always have in the student market and homes which happen to be in great areas for the festival, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/mar/29/story-of-cities-10-edinburgh-new-town-old-town-scottish-enlightenment-james-craig\">Old Town</a>. People would do leases that coincided with being able to provide a festival let. Now they can\u2019t do that, they can\u2019t plan.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"67bb247dc7b5b1ed35fce2efe53ff3b52263e6b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67bb247dc7b5b1ed35fce2efe53ff3b52263e6b3/0_184_5678_3405/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Edinburgh\u2019s Old Town\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Edinburgh\u2019s Old Town has traditionally been a popular spot for lettings during the festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Shona McCarthy, the chief executive of the Edinburgh Fringe Festival Society, said the event was doing what it could to provide alternative accommodation for performers and workers, with about 400 cheaper rooms made available at Queen Margaret and Napier University halls, a 20-minute bus ride from the city centre.</p> <p>\u201cThe single biggest issue has been finding accommodation and cost of accommodation in Edinburgh,\u201d said McCarthy, who added that the fringe has a three-pronged approach to lowering costs for performers. There is the partnership with universities, another one with the Theatre Digs Booker website \u2013 which pairs residents who want to house performers \u2013 and locating cheaper accommodation for artists outside the city centre.</p> <p>McCarthy said everything \u201cneeds to settle\u201d when it comes to PRT. \u201cIt\u2019s very new this year, people don\u2019t know how to work around it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a good thing. It\u2019s about protecting tenants and ensuring that they don\u2019t get thrown out to cater for the festival.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re always trying to strike that balance between doing what is right by local people who live here year-round but also trying to provide affordable provision for the amazing creative people who arrive here for that one month.\u201d</p> <p>This year Dickens said she had noticed a dramatic upturn in artists struggling to find somewhere to stay in August. \u201cWe were taking so many calls from people in a state of panic because they had nowhere to stay,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the old days things would come online at the end and it would be fine, but this year that isn\u2019t going to happen.\u201d</p> <p>Hale added: \u201cI think PRT is a good thing because it protects residents, but I think landlords have preyed on artists\u2019 panic a little bit. I\u2019m happy that Edinburgh residents are being protected but there doesn\u2019t seem to be protection for artists.\u201d</p> <p>Performers <a href=\"https://www.thestage.co.uk/features/2019/angry-residents-low-pay-soaring-rent-edinburgh-fringe/\">have been vocal</a> about <a href=\"https://www.thestage.co.uk/features/2019/angry-residents-low-pay-soaring-rent-edinburgh-fringe/\">the huge debts</a> that can be accrued as a result of a month-long stint at the fringe.

      "bodyText": "Concerns over spiralling rents have dominated the lead-up to this year\u2019s Edinburgh festival fringe, with performers saying the event risks becoming unsustainable and increasingly elitist unless there is a fundamental change to its model. Ticket sales for this year\u2019s edition have increased for the sixth year running and there will be more international performers than ever before, but changes to rental rules in Scotland and an increasing lack of affordable accommodation are threatening to turn the fringe into \u201ca glorified industry showcase\u201d, according to artists. Daisy Hale, the producer of Fatty Fat Fat by Katie Greenall at the Pleasance theatre, says performers have felt a noticeable increase in costs. \u201cWhen I came five years ago I managed to get two flats for \u00a33,000 and this year the one I\u2019m in now costs more than that,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone wants the fringe to continue but it needs to be sustainable. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine coming as a punter, I wouldn\u2019t be able to afford it. There\u2019s no way I could pay to be here for two weeks \u2013 live in a flat, eat, and buy tickets to see shows \u2013 it\u2019d be impossible. If you push out your average punter, then all it is is a glorified industry showcase.\u201d This year there has been a 5% rise in Edinburgh rents, and prices go up sharply during the month-long festival, which brings an estimated \u00a3300m to the Scottish economy. Some of that increase has been attributed to the introduction of the private residential tenancy (PRT) in Scotland, which replaced short assured tenancy in December 2017. Traditionally, student lets would be over a fixed term, which would allow landlords to rent out properties during the festival. With PRT, landlords cannot ask a tenant to leave without a reason. Louise Dickins, the managing director of Edinburgh lettings agency Dickins, said landlords would traditionally write to student tenants in January to ask whether they intended to remain in the property or leave in May after their exams, allowing them to plan for a potential festival let. But PRT rules mean tenants only need to give a month\u2019s notice, with many students confirming they are leaving only at the beginning of May. She said an unintended consequence of PRT was that it had taken hundreds of properties off the market during August, which has in turn pushed prices up further. \u201cThe impact has been major,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the fact leases don\u2019t have end dates. They always have in the student market and homes which happen to be in great areas for the festival, such as Old Town. People would do leases that coincided with being able to provide a festival let. Now they can\u2019t do that, they can\u2019t plan.\u201d Shona McCarthy, the chief executive of the Edinburgh Fringe Festival Society, said the event was doing what it could to provide alternative accommodation for performers and workers, with about 400 cheaper rooms made available at Queen Margaret and Napier University halls, a 20-minute bus ride from the city centre. \u201cThe single biggest issue has been finding accommodation and cost of accommodation in Edinburgh,\u201d said McCarthy, who added that the fringe has a three-pronged approach to lowering costs for performers. There is the partnership with universities, another one with the Theatre Digs Booker website \u2013 which pairs residents who want to house performers \u2013 and locating cheaper accommodation for artists outside the city centre. McCarthy said everything \u201cneeds to settle\u201d when it comes to PRT. \u201cIt\u2019s very new this year, people don\u2019t know how to work around it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a good thing. It\u2019s about protecting tenants and ensuring that they don\u2019t get thrown out to cater for the festival. \u201cWe\u2019re always trying to strike that balance between doing what is right by local people who live here year-round but also trying to provide affordable provision for the amazing creative people who arrive here for that one month.\u201d This year Dickens said she had noticed a dramatic upturn in artists struggling to find somewhere to stay in August. \u201cWe were taking so many calls from people in a state of panic because they had nowhere to stay,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the old days things would come online at the end and it would be fine, but this year that isn\u2019t going to happen.\u201d Hale added: \u201cI think PRT is a good thing because it protects residents, but I think landlords have preyed on artists\u2019 panic a little bit. I\u2019m happy that Edinburgh residents are being protected but there doesn\u2019t seem to be protection for artists.\u201d Performers have been vocal about the huge debts that can be accrued as a result of a month-long stint at the fringe. The comedian Barry Ferns wrote about how he was left \u00a335,000 in debt after 2018\u2019s festival and Hale said that despite fundraising since January, breaking even is a best-case scenario. \u201cWe\u2019ve been fundraising for our show since January and we\u2019ll be lucky if we break even. I know that other people have taken out payday loans or just not bothered to come because they can\u2019t afford it.\u201d Hale believes one of the impacts of rising costs for performers is that the festival becomes less diverse. \u201cIt means that you have fewer artists of colour, working-class artists and disabled artists \u2013 they\u2019re already so poorly represented and are now being regularly priced out.\u201d Anthony Alderson, the director of the Pleasance theatre, said the festival had always been a loss leader for artists but the career benefits meant it was still worth the financial risk. \u201cIt is an expensive exercise,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a lot cheaper than putting something on in London. I still think Edinburgh is one of the affordable places to do it.\u201d Alderson said: \u201cYou can transform your career here,\u201d pointing to the success of Flesh and Bone, a play by Elliot Warren set in an east London tower block that was performed at Edinburgh and went on to win an Olivier award. \u201cThey did that in two years. There is not another festival on the planet that can turn someone\u2019s career around like that.\u201d",

Here, the threat of being eaten by sharks offsets the fantasy of sinking one\u2019s teeth into a huge blushing peach.</p> <h2>Bearing fruit \u2026</h2> <p>Serendipity brought the young illustrator and Dahl together.

In 1961, young Nancy Ekholm Burkert illustrated his kids\u2019 story James and the Giant Peach as a gothic fairytale, rooted in her observations of flora and fauna. Plenty of bite \u2026 This illustration captures some of its most memorable qualities: the Alice in Wonderland-esque play with scale and its thrilling swings between menace and bliss. Here, the threat of being eaten by sharks offsets the fantasy of sinking one\u2019s teeth into a huge blushing peach. Bearing fruit \u2026 Serendipity brought the young illustrator and Dahl together. She had submitted a book to Dahl\u2019s US publisher, Alfred Knopf, who thought she\u2019d be a good match. A fine line \u2026 Her sharp lines recall the precise foaming waves of Japanese seascapes. But she didn\u2019t look at Asian art until later. The likeness was perhaps filtered through her early inspiration, Arthur Rackham, whose scenes were influenced by Japanese woodblock prints. Part of James\u2019 Peachy Pictures, Roald Dahl Museum, Great Missenden, to 29 Sep",

Cling on, there\u2019s more. Behold the \u00a3300k open kitchen made of compressed stone <a href=\"https://www.dekton.co.uk/what-is-dekton/\" title=\"\">Dekton</a> at \u00a3590 a square metre, the handsome types wearing muted-shade aprons, the pared-back font and Scandi menu design. Oh, and the fact it\u2019s open for dinner only (except on Saturdays), and on just four nights a week at that. Mana is the sort of place that, at the moment, is really only being opened in remoter areas of Somerset, Cornwall and the Lakes, and which involve a 24-hour round trip that somehow lands you with a \u00a3300 hotel room bill. (Last week, I was quoted \u00a3420 for a 3pm-11am stay in a \u201ccosy\u201d room in Somerset without dinner.) Martin, however, has put Mana on Blossom Street in Ancoats, just north-east of Manchester City centre. I had to love this energy.</p> <p>I should say right now that Mana is influenced by Noma. Martin went there as an intern in 2016 and his tutorship by Ren\u00e9 Redzepi is clearly present in a million tiny ways. The name doesn\u2019t exactly throw guests off the scent, either. However, Mana loves Noma like Oasis loved The Beatles. Positively, jubilantly, and creating their own buzz in the process. This, as compared with the way in which Glaswegian cover band No-Way-Sis loved Oasis, by honking their way through Supersonic and hoping people were too pissed to notice.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"959e7cd674c702816b9147345ce10d062aacd6c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/959e7cd674c702816b9147345ce10d062aacd6c3/0_265_5501_3301/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Langoustine tail, cured egg yolk and spruce.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Langoustine tail, cured egg yolk and spruce at Mana, Manchester.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaw&amp;Shaw/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To test this out, I took one of Noma\u2019s biggest fans to Mana, and besides some initial quacking about copyright throughout the first 10 minutes, he loved it right through from the opening bars of venison salami with cauliflower fungus to, three hours later, the closing notes of baby pine cone festooned with small, bitter wood ants. Yes, ants. I\u2019m still not sold on this ant malarkey. If they\u2019re all that\u2019s left after global warming, kill me and eat me, too.</p> <p>Each <a href=\"https://www.manarestaurant.co.uk/sample-menu\">dish</a> at Mana, as one might imagine, is a small, fancifully presented art project. \u201cEnglish tostada with all the flowers of spring\u201d is a play on a tortilla, loaded with petals clinging to its cheesy innards. It\u2019s a \u201cWill this choke me?\u201d sort of mouthful that turns out for the best. A small hedgerow of spruce is delivered to the table with chargrilled langoustine attached to spikes and enlivened with cured egg yolk. Oysters are served dramatically, cooked in chicken fat, wrapped in cabbage, shoved back in their shells and served on dry ice, which appealed to the goth in me. Yakitori eel glazed with yeast and deep, red blackcurrant vinegar is a certain star of the show: it is so incredibly funky. Not in an Earth, Wind &amp; Fire way, but more in a Vincent Price on Jacko\u2019s Thriller \u201cThe Funk of 40,000 years\u201d way. A funk that curls your toes with its all-powerful, umami thrust.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f9794cdbedb8bafe601938a0edd809cdac03f41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f9794cdbedb8bafe601938a0edd809cdac03f41/0_0_5616_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hogget fed on seaweed, spring salad, ramsons.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hogget fed on seaweed, spring salad, ramsons at Mana restaurant, Manchester.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaw&amp;Shaw/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The natural wine pairing jollies along, as per usual, and comes lovingly described by the clever, friendly sommelier, but it is challenging to drink in parts. \u201cWhy can they not just serve normal wine?\u201d asks Charles after the fifth glass, which he claims tastes like bunions. Mind you, he\u2019s one of those people who thinks wine should be \u201cdelicious\u201d and \u201cmade under strict rules\u201d, and \u201cnot taste like apple cider vinegar or actual urine\u201d. Free your mind, Charles.</p> <p>I needed all the wine to help block out the tail of \u201cretired dairy cow\u201d we were then invited to eat with rhubarb and oxalis, and which came with a backstory involving pastures and time resting. I do not entertain such stories. They feel like being taken to see Watership Down as a child, and thinking it\u2019s going to be a pleasant story about bunnies. On much safer ground were two wondrous dishes of gaspingly fresh English peas with caviar and plum and, my very favourite, a bowl of sweet, velvety charred onion petals with fermented barley and kelp.</p> <p>Revealing these dishes feels like standing in the foyer at Vue shouting out spoilers. But there is artichoke ice-cream for pudding. Mana is the sound of Manchester turning a corner. I hope the men with the stars agree.</p> <p><strong>Food </strong>9/10 <strong><br>Service </strong>9/10 <strong><br>Atmosphere</strong> 7/10</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.manarestaurant.co.uk/\">Mana</a> 42 Blossom Street, Manchester M4, 0161-392 7294.

Behold the \u00a3300k open kitchen made of compressed stone Dekton at \u00a3590 a square metre, the handsome types wearing muted-shade aprons, the pared-back font and Scandi menu design. Oh, and the fact it\u2019s open for dinner only (except on Saturdays), and on just four nights a week at that. Mana is the sort of place that, at the moment, is really only being opened in remoter areas of Somerset, Cornwall and the Lakes, and which involve a 24-hour round trip that somehow lands you with a \u00a3300 hotel room bill. (Last week, I was quoted \u00a3420 for a 3pm-11am stay in a \u201ccosy\u201d room in Somerset without dinner.) Martin, however, has put Mana on Blossom Street in Ancoats, just north-east of Manchester City centre. I had to love this energy. I should say right now that Mana is influenced by Noma. Martin went there as an intern in 2016 and his tutorship by Ren\u00e9 Redzepi is clearly present in a million tiny ways. The name doesn\u2019t exactly throw guests off the scent, either. However, Mana loves Noma like Oasis loved The Beatles. Positively, jubilantly, and creating their own buzz in the process. This, as compared with the way in which Glaswegian cover band No-Way-Sis loved Oasis, by honking their way through Supersonic and hoping people were too pissed to notice. To test this out, I took one of Noma\u2019s biggest fans to Mana, and besides some initial quacking about copyright throughout the first 10 minutes, he loved it right through from the opening bars of venison salami with cauliflower fungus to, three hours later, the closing notes of baby pine cone festooned with small, bitter wood ants. Yes, ants. I\u2019m still not sold on this ant malarkey. If they\u2019re all that\u2019s left after global warming, kill me and eat me, too. Each dish at Mana, as one might imagine, is a small, fancifully presented art project. \u201cEnglish tostada with all the flowers of spring\u201d is a play on a tortilla, loaded with petals clinging to its cheesy innards. It\u2019s a \u201cWill this choke me?\u201d sort of mouthful that turns out for the best. A small hedgerow of spruce is delivered to the table with chargrilled langoustine attached to spikes and enlivened with cured egg yolk. Oysters are served dramatically, cooked in chicken fat, wrapped in cabbage, shoved back in their shells and served on dry ice, which appealed to the goth in me. Yakitori eel glazed with yeast and deep, red blackcurrant vinegar is a certain star of the show: it is so incredibly funky. Not in an Earth, Wind &amp; Fire way, but more in a Vincent Price on Jacko\u2019s Thriller \u201cThe Funk of 40,000 years\u201d way. A funk that curls your toes with its all-powerful, umami thrust. The natural wine pairing jollies along, as per usual, and comes lovingly described by the clever, friendly sommelier, but it is challenging to drink in parts. \u201cWhy can they not just serve normal wine?\u201d asks Charles after the fifth glass, which he claims tastes like bunions. Mind you, he\u2019s one of those people who thinks wine should be \u201cdelicious\u201d and \u201cmade under strict rules\u201d, and \u201cnot taste like apple cider vinegar or actual urine\u201d. Free your mind, Charles. I needed all the wine to help block out the tail of \u201cretired dairy cow\u201d we were then invited to eat with rhubarb and oxalis, and which came with a backstory involving pastures and time resting. I do not entertain such stories. They feel like being taken to see Watership Down as a child, and thinking it\u2019s going to be a pleasant story about bunnies. On much safer ground were two wondrous dishes of gaspingly fresh English peas with caviar and plum and, my very favourite, a bowl of sweet, velvety charred onion petals with fermented barley and kelp. Revealing these dishes feels like standing in the foyer at Vue shouting out spoilers. But there is artichoke ice-cream for pudding. Mana is the sound of Manchester turning a corner. I hope the men with the stars agree. Food 9/10 Service 9/10 Atmosphere 7/10 \u2022 Mana 42 Blossom Street, Manchester M4, 0161-392 7294.

      "bodyText": "A blood test that can detect signs of Alzheimer\u2019s as much as 20 years before the disease begins to have a debilitating effect has been developed by researchers in the US. Scientists at the Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis in Missouri believe the test can identify changes in the brain suggestive of Alzheimer\u2019s with 94% accuracy, while being much cheaper and simpler than a PET brain scan. The results of the study, which was published in the journal Neurology on Thursday, represent a potential breakthrough in the fight against the disease. \u201cRight now we screen people for clinical trials with brain scans, which is time-consuming and expensive, and enrolling participants takes years,\u201d said the senior author, Randall Bateman, a leading professor of neurology. \u201cBut with a blood test, we could potentially screen thousands of people a month. That means we can more efficiently enrol participants in clinical trials, which will help us find treatments faster, and could have an enormous impact on the cost of the disease as well as the human suffering that goes with it.\u201d The researchers said they had found a way to measure levels of the protein amyloid beta, a key indicator of Alzheimer\u2019s, in the blood. They can then use such levels to predict whether the protein has accumulated in the brain. That analysis could then be combined with two other major Alzheimer\u2019s risk factors \u2013 age and the presence of the genetic variant APOE4 \u2013 to accurately identify the relevant changes in the brain. The researchers said the clumps of protein begin to form in the brain up to two decades before the onset of the characteristic memory loss, suggesting the tests could be used to predict Alzheimer\u2019s years in advance. However, the benefits of such testing would not be seen to their fullest extent until treatments to halt the disease are developed. In January 2018, a team of scientists revealed their work on a test that used mass spectrometry techniques to identify patients with a rogue peptide in their blood plasma, indicating a buildup of beta-amyloid in the brain. The latest study looked at 158 people aged older than 50.

      "bodyText": "This summer, as the snows finally melt across the Alps, a record 35 bearded vulture chicks are expected to leave their nests and take to the skies to patrol their mountain home, in one of the most successful wildlife comebacks of recent times. \u201cBearded vultures were hunted to extinction in the Alps in the early 20th century. People referred to them as the devil bird believing that they would carry off small children and sheep,\u201d said Th\u00e9o Mazet, who works for Asters, a French wildlife organisation helping to bring the birds back to the Alps. But attitudes have changed and the vultures have made a dramatic return, albeit with a helping hand. \u201cA captive breeding and reintroduction project began in the late 1980s and there are now a total of 250 birds, including 50 breeding pairs of bearded vultures in the Alps,\u201d said Mazet. Mazet works at a specialist captive breeding centre in a secluded forest high above the alpine town of Sallanches, one of five centres in the mountain range. Here Mazet prepares food for the seven vultures housed in the centre\u2019s massive aviary. He carefully weighs chunks of freshly butchered sheeps\u2019 and goats\u2019 legs for the birds \u2013 the only avian species to live on a diet of animal bones. \u201cBearded vultures are scavengers and act as the rubbish collectors of the natural world which helps to eliminate potentially harmful bacteria and the spread of diseases, so keeping the mountain environment healthy,\u201d he said. Key to the project\u2019s success has been the 100 captive vultures held in the breeding centres throughout Europe, which in turn are providing birds to be returned to the wild. Jos\u00e9 Tavares, the director of the Vulture Conservation Foundation, which is spearheading the reintroduction of the bearded vulture across Europe, explains that they only use birds that have been bred in captivity rather than capturing and relocating birds from elsewhere. The project has so far cost tens of millions of euros \u2013 so why spend so much money and effort on the reintroduction of one species? \u201cThe bearded vulture is an umbrella species so that the work we do in improving the mountain habitat for the bearded vulture benefits other mountain wildlife too, such as black grouse, golden eagles and ibex,\u201d said Tavares. He believes the reintroduction project is helping other wider conservation and rewilding goals. \u201cBearded vultures are scavengers, they\u2019re not predators, so they won\u2019t kill cattle or game species such as chamois, so uniquely there are relatively few conflicts with people \u2013 unlike wolves or bears which are far more controversial,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause bearded vultures are a neutral species, everyone works with you \u2013 so for example, we\u2019ve been able to talk about banning the use of lead bullets with hunters. If we\u2019d been working with wolves we wouldn\u2019t even be able to sit in the same room as the hunters.\u201d The Alps, Europe\u2019s biggest mountain range, have undergone intensive development in recent years from both the ski and hydroelectric power industries. The result is that one of the main threats facing bearded vultures is collisions with ski lift cables and power lines \u2013 accidents that kill one or two birds every year. \u201cWe are working closely with ski resorts and power companies to fit visual deterrents on their cables to reduce this problem,\u201d said Tavares. Tavares is upbeat about the bird\u2019s future and its value to the region. He says he realised its potential after the response of locals to the first reintroductions: \u201cWhen I saw the enthusiasm of the local stakeholders when we released our first bearded vulture back into the Alps, I instantly realised that we had something very powerful.\u201d",

The implied happy ending of the Obama era has been unceremoniously amputated and we are back with the moods of anger and uncertainty that drove the film in the first place.

And of course the ending, with a black man killed in a police chokehold, could have been filmed at any time since 1989.</p> <p>It\u2019s an unbearably hot day in New York, the background music being provided by DJ Mister Se\u00f1or Love Daddy, played by the young Samuel L Jackson.

His girlfriend Tina (Rosie Perez) rules the movie by virtue of her explosive dance sequence over the opening credits, to Public Enemy\u2019s Fight the Power. Sal is the middle-aged restaurant owner, who employs his two shiftless sons and is at once wary of his predominantly black clientele and sentimental about having \u201cfed\u201d them all since their childhood.

Buggin\u2019 Out suggests, to Sal\u2019s astonishment, that because African-Americans form virtually all his customer base, they have a democratic right to at least one black American on his wall. Sal is not ready for a new political world, whose dawn Lee sketches out here, in which it is not enough simply to refrain from making overtly racist gestures: omission or erasure is equally insulting.</p> <p>White people are at war with black people, who are in turn at war with Latinos, but Lee extends to each faction a vibrant pop-culture identity. Where he is less complimentary is to the Koreans who run the convenience store across from Sal\u2019s. They are still an exoticised mystery, and in the riot scene it isn\u2019t immediately clear if they will be protected from looting by virtue of ethnic underdog status or be considered de facto whites. (There hasn\u2019t been much from Hollywood or indie cinema about the Korean experience in New York or Los Angeles \u2013 although Justin Chon\u2019s 2017 film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/15/gook-review-justin-chon-la-riots\">Gook</a> is worth a look.)</p> <p>The film closes with contrasting statements from Martin Luther King and Malcolm X, one saying that violence is never justified and the other that it is in self-defence. Malcolm X effectively gets the last word. But just as affecting is the desolate peace process between Sal and Mookie as they debate how much back-pay Mookie is owed.</p>",

Buggin\u2019 Out suggests, to Sal\u2019s astonishment, that because African-Americans form virtually all his customer base, they have a democratic right to at least one black American on his wall. Sal is not ready for a new political world, whose dawn Lee sketches out here, in which it is not enough simply to refrain from making overtly racist gestures: omission or erasure is equally insulting. White people are at war with black people, who are in turn at war with Latinos, but Lee extends to each faction a vibrant pop-culture identity. Where he is less complimentary is to the Koreans who run the convenience store across from Sal\u2019s. They are still an exoticised mystery, and in the riot scene it isn\u2019t immediately clear if they will be protected from looting by virtue of ethnic underdog status or be considered de facto whites. (There hasn\u2019t been much from Hollywood or indie cinema about the Korean experience in New York or Los Angeles \u2013 although Justin Chon\u2019s 2017 film Gook is worth a look.) The film closes with contrasting statements from Martin Luther King and Malcolm X, one saying that violence is never justified and the other that it is in self-defence. Malcolm X effectively gets the last word. But just as affecting is the desolate peace process between Sal and Mookie as they debate how much back-pay Mookie is owed.",

Lineup drama aside, expect them to rattle through all the bangers, from Push It to Shoop. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.theo2.co.uk/events/detail/salt-n-pepa\">Indigo at The O2, SE10, Friday 9 August</a></em></p> <h2>Visions festival</h2> <p>Taking over a selection of venues in east London enclave Victoria Park, the annual Visions festival returns with a typically eclectic lineup.

Plus there\u2019s a dog show! <br><em><a href=\"http://visionsfestival.com/\">Various venues, London, Saturday 3 August</a></em></p> <h2>Anitta</h2> <p>Pop star Anitta is next-level famous. Not only has she collaborated with everyone from Madonna (on the recent Madame X) to J Balvin, but it\u2019s estimated that more than 10% of the population of Brazil follow her on Instagram. She even has her own Netflix show, Vai Anitta. See what all the fuss is about at this show \u2013 part of Nile Rodgers\u2019s Meltdown festival. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whats-on/136635-anitta-2019\">Royal Festival Hall, SE1, Tuesday 6 August</a></em></p> <h2>The National</h2> <p>May\u2019s I Am Easy to Find became the National\u2019s fourth album in row to go Top 5 on both sides of the Atlantic. Which is pretty good going, seeing as most people couldn\u2019t hum one of their songs and wouldn\u2019t know a member of the band if they shouted \u201cI\u2019m in the National\u201d while wearing a T-shirt with an arrow pointing upwards. Still, their reflective indie musings feel perfect for balmy, late summer evenings. <br><em><a href=\"https://americanmary.com/\">Kelvingrove Park, Glasgow, Tuesday 6 &amp; Wednesday 7 August</a></em></p> <p><em>MC</em></p> <h2>Gwilym Simcock Trio</h2> <p>From bebop and swing to techno and township music, the resourcefulness of jazz\u2019s classic piano-bass-drums trio format is revisited in the sixth annual festival of the method at Ronnie Scott\u2019s. Highlights include UK pianist Gwilym Simcock, American legend Kenny Barron, South Africa\u2019s Bokani Dyer, Nikki Yeoh\u2019s Andalusian and Arabic interpretations, and more. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.ronniescotts.co.uk/performances/view/5372-gwilym-simcock-trio-international-piano-trio-festival-2019\">International Piano Trio Festival, Ronnie Scott\u2019s, W1, Monday 5 August</a></em></p> <p><em>JF</em></p> <h2><strong>Three of the best ... classical concerts</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dedf4a99bef2a47ee0bf52e7cc6a5210a682641b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dedf4a99bef2a47ee0bf52e7cc6a5210a682641b/625_967_3952_2372/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yuja Wang\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Devilishly good\u2026 Yuja Wang.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Douglas</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Must the Devil Have All the Good Tunes?</h2> <p>New works are rare at Edinburgh international festival now but the LA Philharmonic includes a European premiere in its three appearances this year. Gustavo Dudamel and his orchestra gave the first performance of John Adams\u2019s new piano concerto in March in LA; the soloist was Yuja Wang, who\u2019ll also play it here. Adams\u2019s title came from a magazine article, suggesting a Totentanz, a dance of death, and as well as solo piano there\u2019s honky-tonk piano and bass guitar. But there are quieter episodes, inspired, Adams says, by Wang\u2019s lyrical playing. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.eif.co.uk/whats-on/2019/laphil2\">Usher Hall, Edinburgh, Sunday 4 August</a></em></p> <h2>Prom 20: Sibelius</h2> <p>At first sight, the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra\u2019s concert is standard Proms fare: an all-Finnish evening of Sibelius. But the version of the Fifth Symphony that Thomas Dausgaard is conducting is not the usual three-movement score, but the four-movement scheme that Sibelius completed first, in 1915. It has never been performed in the UK, so this is a rare chance to hear how one of the 20th century\u2019s great symphonic achievements began life. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.royalalberthall.com/tickets/proms/bbc-proms-2019/prom-20-pekka-kuusisto/\">Royal Albert Hall, SW7, Saturday 3 August</a></em></p> <h2>The Rosary Sonatas</h2> <p>For three short recitals in Scotland\u2019s oldest purpose-built concert hall, the violinist Rachel Podger, accompanied by harpsichordist Marcin \u015awi\u0105tkiewicz and theorbo player Daniele Caminiti, will play one of the most remarkable collections of baroque string music. Heinrich Ignaz Franz von Biber\u2019s sequence of 15 Rosary Sonatas are musical meditations on the life of Christ, and some of the most challenging works ever composed for the instrument. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.eif.co.uk/whats-on/2019/rosary1\">St Cecilia\u2019s Hall, Edinburgh, Tuesday 6, Thursday 8 &amp; Friday 9 August</a></em></p> <p><em>AC</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"be7b7bfd90d7b0d98758695d8aab4f20b084ebae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be7b7bfd90d7b0d98758695d8aab4f20b084ebae/445_351_3833_5651/678.jpg\" alt=\"Takis\u2019s Telepainting, 1964\" width=\"678\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Takis\u2019s Telepainting, 1964.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Dunkley and Mark Heathcote/Takis \u00a9 ADAGP/DACS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Five of the best ... exhibitions</strong></h2> <h2>Bridget Riley</h2> <p>This is what artistic greatness looks like. Bridget Riley revolutionised art in the 1960s. Her optical paintings confuse your perception of reality and make you glimpse the mystery of your own mind as it plays tricks on itself. She uses science and yet this superb retrospective reveals a Romantic who wants to change your life. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.nationalgalleries.org/exhibition/bridget-riley\">Scottish National Gallery, Edinburgh, to 22 September</a></em></p> <h2>Joana Vasconcelos</h2> <p>A swimming pool tiled with a flamboyantly crafted design is this acclaimed Portuguese artist\u2019s antidote to the summer heat. Her new installation for this fine sculpture park outside Edinburgh really is a working pool, with bathing sessions. Vasconcelos calls it Gateway and her cocktail of water and colour claims to be a portal to other worlds. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.jupiterartland.org/exhibitions/gateway\">Jupiter Artland, nr Edinburgh, to 30 September</a></em></p> <h2>Joseph Beuys/Leonardo da Vinci</h2> <p>Of all the Leonardo commemorations this year, this may sound the least likely. German performance artist and sculptor Joseph Beuys surely belongs in a very different artistic age. But Beuys was fascinated by Leonardo and this exhibition reveals the drawings he made in response to the polymath\u2019s notebooks. Beuys saw in Leonardo not so much a scientist as a shaman, whose visions of flowing water and flight explore our place in a magical cosmos. <br><em><a href=\"https://festival19.summerhall.co.uk/exhibition/joseph-beuys-leonardo-da-vinci/\">Summerhall, Edinburgh, to 27 October</a></em></p> <h2>Bartolom\u00e9 Bermejo</h2> <p>This small, free exhibition is a lovely encounter with an enigmatic medieval mind. Bartolom\u00e9 Bermejo painted altarpieces that glow with the intense Christian beliefs of 15th-century Spain. He delights in the glistening armour of Saint Michael defeating a wonderfully grotesque devil, and paints the Virgin Mary mourning Christ. Yet Bermejo was probably Jewish and his true identity haunts the shadows of these gothic masterpieces. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/exhibitions/bartolome-bermejo\">The National Gallery, WC2, to 29 September</a></em></p> <h2>Takis</h2> <p>The art of Takis has magnetic appeal \u2026 sorry. Since the early 60s, this Greek artist has used electromagnetism to explore the boundaries of art and science. From sculptures that suspend metal objects in space to dancing magnets and eerie self-playing instruments, his creations reveal the beauty of nature\u2019s hidden forces. A thought-provoking encounter with some of the craziest science toys ever made. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/takis\">Tate Modern, SE1, to 27 October</a></em></p> <p><em>JJ</em></p> <h2><strong>Five of the best ... theatre shows</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"151888f727d2775d567dd840bb89b3a426780f44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/151888f727d2775d567dd840bb89b3a426780f44/0_960_4800_2880/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pet Shop Boys\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Musik makers\u2026 Pet Shop Boys.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pelle Cre\u0301pin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Evita</h2> <p>There has been a spate of Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber revivals recently, including a joyous new take on Joseph. Now we have got a shiny new production of Evita, directed by the always edgy Jamie Lloyd and starring American actor Samantha Pauly. It\u2019s a musical retelling of Eva Per\u00f3n\u2019s rise from poverty to become Argentina\u2019s first lady, and is lit up by a passionate score. <br><em><a href=\"https://openairtheatre.com/production/evita\">The Open Air Theatre, NW1, to 21 September</a></em></p> <h2>Musik</h2> <p>This sounds like fun. Writer Jonathan Harvey and Pet Shop Boys Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe have joined forces to write a one-woman musical-theatre cabaret show. Frances Barber reprises the role of dried-up and drug-addled rock star Billie Trix, a part she first played in Pet Shop Boys\u2019 2001 musical Closer to Heaven. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.assemblyfestival.com/whats-on/musik\">Assembly Rooms, Edinburgh, Monday 5 to 24 August</a></em></p> <h2>Actually</h2> <p>A European premiere for US playwright Anna Ziegler\u2019s intense two-hander, Actually. The play is set in Princeton College and is about an alleged rape between two students. But how to get to the truth when we are merely setting one person\u2019s word against another\u2019s? Emerging talent Oscar Toeman directs and the play will star Yasmin Paige and Simon Manyonda (set to feature in the BBC\u2019s His Dark Materials). <br><em><a href=\"https://trafalgarentertainment.com/shows/actually/\">Trafalgar Studios 2, SW1, Tuesday 6 to 31 August</a></em></p> <h2>The Argument</h2> <p>This feels like a fun blockbuster for the summer. It\u2019s written by William Boyd, best known for his novels including, most recently, Love Is Blind. The play premiered at Hampstead Downstairs in 2016 but this is its first major outing. It\u2019s about 10 arguments surrounding a marriage in crisis and stars Felicity Kendal and Rupert Vansittart as the warring couple. Christopher Luscombe directs and should bring real energy to proceedings. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.theatreroyal.org.uk/event/the-argument/\">Theatre Royal, Bath, Wednesday 7 to 24 August</a></em></p> <h2>8 Hotels</h2> <p>Nicholas Wright wrote Mrs Klein and the Olivier award-winning Vincent in Brixton and is a real master of his craft. His latest work is about celebrated actor, singer and campaigner Paul Robeson, of Ol\u2019 Man River fame. When Robeson takes on the role of Othello and tours the country with brilliant young actor Uta Hagen, the boundaries between off-stage and on-stage, the personal and political, begin to blur.

It\u2019s a complimentary label but a limiting one. Why always \u201clovely\u201d? The duo tackle such knotty questions in this dance-theatre-comedy show. <br><em><a href=\"http://thehiccupproject.com/\">Zoo Southside, Edinburgh, to 17 August</a></em></p> <h2>Matthew Bourne\u2019s Romeo + Juliet</h2> <p>Shakespeare gets the Bourne treatment as the choreographer\u2019s latest show starts a London summer run.

The Angry Birds Movie 2 (U) (Thurop Van Orman, John Rice, 2019, US) 97 mins The birds v pigs slingshot phone game must have been about the most unpromising-ever source material for a film, but somehow the people behind this series have crafted something entirely acceptable and not unentertaining. Though this second chunk doesn\u2019t exactly strain anyone\u2019s brain, it\u2019s a cheerful wodge of child-centred fun, with a nice empowerment message and a good few gags sprinkled throughout. Do the Right Thing (15) (Spike Lee, 1989, US) 120 mins Spike Lee\u2019s state-of-the-nation address from 1989 still packs a hell of a punch, right from the forceful opening-credits strut by Rosie Perez. Lee cast himself in the linchpin role of Mookie, the pizza delivery boy who ends up sparking a riot in a tense, boiling Brooklyn. AP Five of the best ... rock &amp; pop Salt-N-Pepa For their latest reunion, which recently included a US tour with New Kids on the Block, Debbie Gibson and Tiffany, hip-hop pioneers Salt-N-Pepa are down to a duo after the departure of DJ Spinderella following what she described on Instagram as a \u201c\u2018termination\u2019 email\u201d. Lineup drama aside, expect them to rattle through all the bangers, from Push It to Shoop. Indigo at The O2, SE10, Friday 9 August Visions festival Taking over a selection of venues in east London enclave Victoria Park, the annual Visions festival returns with a typically eclectic lineup. As well as experimental dreamscapes courtesy of Anna Meredith, White Denim and heavy metallers Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs will also be on hand to pulverise your ears. Plus there\u2019s a dog show! Various venues, London, Saturday 3 August Anitta Pop star Anitta is next-level famous. Not only has she collaborated with everyone from Madonna (on the recent Madame X) to J Balvin, but it\u2019s estimated that more than 10% of the population of Brazil follow her on Instagram. She even has her own Netflix show, Vai Anitta. See what all the fuss is about at this show \u2013 part of Nile Rodgers\u2019s Meltdown festival. Royal Festival Hall, SE1, Tuesday 6 August The National May\u2019s I Am Easy to Find became the National\u2019s fourth album in row to go Top 5 on both sides of the Atlantic. Which is pretty good going, seeing as most people couldn\u2019t hum one of their songs and wouldn\u2019t know a member of the band if they shouted \u201cI\u2019m in the National\u201d while wearing a T-shirt with an arrow pointing upwards. Still, their reflective indie musings feel perfect for balmy, late summer evenings. Kelvingrove Park, Glasgow, Tuesday 6 &amp; Wednesday 7 August MC Gwilym Simcock Trio From bebop and swing to techno and township music, the resourcefulness of jazz\u2019s classic piano-bass-drums trio format is revisited in the sixth annual festival of the method at Ronnie Scott\u2019s. Highlights include UK pianist Gwilym Simcock, American legend Kenny Barron, South Africa\u2019s Bokani Dyer, Nikki Yeoh\u2019s Andalusian and Arabic interpretations, and more. International Piano Trio Festival, Ronnie Scott\u2019s, W1, Monday 5 August JF Three of the best ... classical concerts Must the Devil Have All the Good Tunes? New works are rare at Edinburgh international festival now but the LA Philharmonic includes a European premiere in its three appearances this year. Gustavo Dudamel and his orchestra gave the first performance of John Adams\u2019s new piano concerto in March in LA; the soloist was Yuja Wang, who\u2019ll also play it here. Adams\u2019s title came from a magazine article, suggesting a Totentanz, a dance of death, and as well as solo piano there\u2019s honky-tonk piano and bass guitar. But there are quieter episodes, inspired, Adams says, by Wang\u2019s lyrical playing. Usher Hall, Edinburgh, Sunday 4 August Prom 20: Sibelius At first sight, the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra\u2019s concert is standard Proms fare: an all-Finnish evening of Sibelius. But the version of the Fifth Symphony that Thomas Dausgaard is conducting is not the usual three-movement score, but the four-movement scheme that Sibelius completed first, in 1915. It has never been performed in the UK, so this is a rare chance to hear how one of the 20th century\u2019s great symphonic achievements began life. Royal Albert Hall, SW7, Saturday 3 August The Rosary Sonatas For three short recitals in Scotland\u2019s oldest purpose-built concert hall, the violinist Rachel Podger, accompanied by harpsichordist Marcin \u015awi\u0105tkiewicz and theorbo player Daniele Caminiti, will play one of the most remarkable collections of baroque string music. Heinrich Ignaz Franz von Biber\u2019s sequence of 15 Rosary Sonatas are musical meditations on the life of Christ, and some of the most challenging works ever composed for the instrument. St Cecilia\u2019s Hall, Edinburgh, Tuesday 6, Thursday 8 &amp; Friday 9 August AC Five of the best ... exhibitions Bridget Riley This is what artistic greatness looks like. Bridget Riley revolutionised art in the 1960s. Her optical paintings confuse your perception of reality and make you glimpse the mystery of your own mind as it plays tricks on itself. She uses science and yet this superb retrospective reveals a Romantic who wants to change your life. Scottish National Gallery, Edinburgh, to 22 September Joana Vasconcelos A swimming pool tiled with a flamboyantly crafted design is this acclaimed Portuguese artist\u2019s antidote to the summer heat. Her new installation for this fine sculpture park outside Edinburgh really is a working pool, with bathing sessions. Vasconcelos calls it Gateway and her cocktail of water and colour claims to be a portal to other worlds. Jupiter Artland, nr Edinburgh, to 30 September Joseph Beuys/Leonardo da Vinci Of all the Leonardo commemorations this year, this may sound the least likely. German performance artist and sculptor Joseph Beuys surely belongs in a very different artistic age. But Beuys was fascinated by Leonardo and this exhibition reveals the drawings he made in response to the polymath\u2019s notebooks. Beuys saw in Leonardo not so much a scientist as a shaman, whose visions of flowing water and flight explore our place in a magical cosmos. Summerhall, Edinburgh, to 27 October Bartolom\u00e9 Bermejo This small, free exhibition is a lovely encounter with an enigmatic medieval mind. Bartolom\u00e9 Bermejo painted altarpieces that glow with the intense Christian beliefs of 15th-century Spain. He delights in the glistening armour of Saint Michael defeating a wonderfully grotesque devil, and paints the Virgin Mary mourning Christ. Yet Bermejo was probably Jewish and his true identity haunts the shadows of these gothic masterpieces. The National Gallery, WC2, to 29 September Takis The art of Takis has magnetic appeal \u2026 sorry. Since the early 60s, this Greek artist has used electromagnetism to explore the boundaries of art and science. From sculptures that suspend metal objects in space to dancing magnets and eerie self-playing instruments, his creations reveal the beauty of nature\u2019s hidden forces. A thought-provoking encounter with some of the craziest science toys ever made. Tate Modern, SE1, to 27 October JJ Five of the best ... theatre shows Evita There has been a spate of Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber revivals recently, including a joyous new take on Joseph. Now we have got a shiny new production of Evita, directed by the always edgy Jamie Lloyd and starring American actor Samantha Pauly. It\u2019s a musical retelling of Eva Per\u00f3n\u2019s rise from poverty to become Argentina\u2019s first lady, and is lit up by a passionate score. The Open Air Theatre, NW1, to 21 September Musik This sounds like fun. Writer Jonathan Harvey and Pet Shop Boys Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe have joined forces to write a one-woman musical-theatre cabaret show. Frances Barber reprises the role of dried-up and drug-addled rock star Billie Trix, a part she first played in Pet Shop Boys\u2019 2001 musical Closer to Heaven. Assembly Rooms, Edinburgh, Monday 5 to 24 August Actually A European premiere for US playwright Anna Ziegler\u2019s intense two-hander, Actually. The play is set in Princeton College and is about an alleged rape between two students. But how to get to the truth when we are merely setting one person\u2019s word against another\u2019s? Emerging talent Oscar Toeman directs and the play will star Yasmin Paige and Simon Manyonda (set to feature in the BBC\u2019s His Dark Materials). Trafalgar Studios 2, SW1, Tuesday 6 to 31 August The Argument This feels like a fun blockbuster for the summer. It\u2019s written by William Boyd, best known for his novels including, most recently, Love Is Blind. The play premiered at Hampstead Downstairs in 2016 but this is its first major outing. It\u2019s about 10 arguments surrounding a marriage in crisis and stars Felicity Kendal and Rupert Vansittart as the warring couple. Christopher Luscombe directs and should bring real energy to proceedings. Theatre Royal, Bath, Wednesday 7 to 24 August 8 Hotels Nicholas Wright wrote Mrs Klein and the Olivier award-winning Vincent in Brixton and is a real master of his craft. His latest work is about celebrated actor, singer and campaigner Paul Robeson, of Ol\u2019 Man River fame. When Robeson takes on the role of Othello and tours the country with brilliant young actor Uta Hagen, the boundaries between off-stage and on-stage, the personal and political, begin to blur. Richard Eyre directs. Chichester Festival Theatre: Minerva, to 24 August MG Three of the best ... dance shows Scottish Ballet: The Crucible Arthur Miller\u2019s allegorical play gets a dance makeover from American choreographer Helen Pickett, a former member of William Forsythe\u2019s Ballett Frankfurt. Pickett takes on the drama of the Salem witch trials in this world premiere for the Edinburgh international festival, with the impressive dancers of Scottish Ballet. Edinburgh Playhouse, Saturday 3 to Monday 5 August The Hiccup Project: Lovely Girls Everywhere Cristina MacKerron and Chess Dillon-Reams go, they find themselves introduced as \u201cthe lovely Hiccup girls\u201d. It\u2019s a complimentary label but a limiting one. Why always \u201clovely\u201d? The duo tackle such knotty questions in this dance-theatre-comedy show. Zoo Southside, Edinburgh, to 17 August Matthew Bourne\u2019s Romeo + Juliet Shakespeare gets the Bourne treatment as the choreographer\u2019s latest show starts a London summer run. Here the impassioned young lovers are reimagined in a near-future world where having too-strong feelings is punished by the powers that be.

      "body": "<p>Meeting famous writers never makes Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah feel \u201cweird or nerdy\u201d, he says. After all, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/04/what-writers-really-do-when-they-write\" title=\"\">George Saunders</a> was his university tutor and later became a friend. The writer\u2019s writer Lynne Tillman was his mentor. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/02/roxane-gay-no-one-guaranteed-love-affection-interview-hunger\" title=\"\">Roxane Gay</a> has stamped a cover quote on <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/dec/07/friday-black-nana-kwame-adjei-brenyah-review-short-stories\" title=\"\">Friday Black</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/dec/07/friday-black-nana-kwame-adjei-brenyah-review-short-stories\" title=\"\">,</a> his debut short story collection, urging the world simply to \u201cread this book\u201d.</p> <p>Since its publication last autumn, Adjei-Brenyah has had more than enough opportunities to test his reaction to meeting his literary heroes \u2013 moments such as the night in February when he unexpectedly won the book of the year prize at the PEN awards. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/zadiesmith\" title=\"\">Zadie Smith</a> was sitting directly behind him as they read his name out. \u201cShe looked so regal and epic \u2013 her aura is so strong. And Zadie Smith had read my book!\u201d Dazed and giggly, the 28-year-old radiates a self-assured, effervescent energy \u2013 albeit one he describes as something of a cover. \u201cI have to be even keel about all [of this], otherwise I will go crazy,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cBefore this book stuff happened, I\u2019d been on a plane like three times in my life \u2026 Now I\u2019m on a plane pretty much every day and it\u2019s wild. It\u2019s really absurd to think that people \u2013 and this is the cool part \u2013 living so far from where I\u2019m from, have read my book and have felt anything about it, you know?\u201d If he weren\u2019t so genuinely excited, this might seem excessively self-effacing. \u201cThis is weird \u2026 Like I\u2019m supposed to come into this room and think this is <em>normal</em>?\u201d It is a small meeting room at his London publisher; the walls are lined with dozens of copies of his book. Adjei-Brenyah is jet lagged, which he blames for being \u201cat least 25% less funny\u201d. Yet all this should be his new normal. <em>Friday Black</em> is stunning. Adjei-Brenyah sets us in a bleak near future, \u201ca world a little bit worse than ours\u201d, he explains, \u201cso maybe, collectively we could imagine a world that was much better\u201d.</p> <p>The dozen stories have been written over the course of eight or nine years, mercilessly revised and chosen by him from a bank of about 80. \u201cLet\u2019s say 70 of those 80 are trash. No, really, they were never going to be anything more than terrible \u2026 An idea is not enough, you could have a thousand good ideas every day. Usually, I have somebody\u2019s voice in my mind for the stories that actually take.\u201d </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Maybe my stories could help some\u00adone feel seen. I thought they could push the conver\u00adsation in a direction that mattered</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Those stories that did make the final cut have been precisely edited to work together like a concept album; in rhythm and style and beat, Adjei-Brenyah delivers a wildly creative collection that isn\u2019t so much dealing with race, capitalism, violence, poverty, abortion and injustice as it is telling it from the inside out with blood and guts. At his most confident, he is driven by the idea that \u201cmaybe they could help someone feel seen. I thought they could push the conversation in a direction that mattered.\u201d </p> <p>Adjei-Brenyah\u2019s work is often called \u201ctimely\u201d and <em>Friday Black</em> opens with \u201cThe Finkelstein 5\u201d, a visceral account of murdered black children, decapitated by an attacker with a chainsaw. And it doesn\u2019t let up. He imagines a dystopia in which corpses are swept from the floors of Black Friday sales; where aborted twin foetuses, grey and dry, fight each other and compete for affection. In reference to the killer of teenager <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/20/trayvon-martin-death-story-so-far\" title=\"\">Trayvon Martin</a>, he creates Zimmer Land: a theme park for white people to act out brutal fantasies against people of colour. Saunders describes the stories in <em>Friday Black</em> as \u201cstrange, crazed, urgent and funny\u201d \u2013 and you can imagine film-makers such as Jordan Peele or Kahlil Joseph putting them on screen.</p> <p>\u201c\u2018Timely\u2019 has come up a lot,\u201d Adjei-Brenyah says, mildly weary. \u201cI think the scary thing is that [these problems have] been there for so long \u2026 there is a certain way of black people being murdered that has become palatable. I want it to be less so.\u201d <em>Friday Black</em> is only considered timely, he says, because the subjects that he has dealt with his whole life have finally reached the mainstream. \u201cMy book is being absorbed the way it is and amplified the way it is because people want to be thinking about these sorts of issues now.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact that people are willing to think about it is good, but the problems that we\u2019re trying to deal with might take a long time to sort out. It\u2019s terrifying to think what will happen at the next election but I think overall, we\u2019re hopefully going to trend towards something better.\u201d</p> <p>At the moment, he is preoccupied with the superrich. He doesn\u2019t understand the accumulation of wealth in a world that is unjustifiably unequal, where one person can be living on the streets while another has 10 homes. \u201cI\u2019m used to being like: \u2018Let me transfer $7 from this account to that account so I can have enough to pull out $20 cash.\u2019 All of a sudden, you win this prize [the PEN award of $75,000] and I can\u2019t even exactly understand ... I feel guilty. I\u2019m like, you know, is anyone allowed to have that at one time? So then, how do these billionaires feel?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1c2194ef7e988b75b7b749209001b02e65c8a24c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c2194ef7e988b75b7b749209001b02e65c8a24c/0_0_985_1279/770.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters at a \u2018Justice for Trayvon\u2019 rally in Los Angeles, July 2013.\" width=\"770\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters at a \u2018Justice for Trayvon\u2019 rally in Los Angeles, July 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UPI/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s obviously morally wrong. It\u2019s inherently not sustainable.\u201d He looks quizzical, still unknotting the thread. \u201cThe government regulates how much money is in circulation, there is a pot that everyone has to share from, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s coming from nowhere. So you, as [a rich] individual, can be taking someone else\u2019s money, taking from them directly. It\u2019s almost like, what if you had an endless buffet and there\u2019s people starved next to you and you don\u2019t give them food? That is what you\u2019re doing every single day.\u201d</p> <p>As the son of Ghanaian immigrants to the US \u2013 a lawyer father and teacher mother \u2013 whose health and finances both suffered in their new country, Adjei-Brenyah is wary of how good America is at conflating \u201cmorality with <em>things</em> \u2026 like the acquisition of stuff is a duty? It\u2019s weird.\u201d</p> <p>His family moved from Queens, New York, when he was seven years old and settled in Spring Valley, a predominantly immigrant community 22 miles north of Manhattan. \u201cAll it takes is one person getting sick and your house is foreclosed,\u201d he says, recalling what his family went through. \u201cNow you\u2019re getting evicted ... We had a period where we were comfortable \u2013 seeing that change pretty quickly is part of why I am so suspicious.\u201d</p> <p>The time he spent working in retail \u2013 a job he was only able to give up a few years ago \u2013 has also gone some way to shaping his thinking. Now he teaches at Syracuse University where he received his MFA in creative writing. He has just bought his first TV; his first laptop was bought for him by his older sister, well after he had started college and been overwhelmed by \u201call these kids in every class with their MacBooks.</p> <p>\u201cI had no understanding of what it was to be a writer, but I think the reason I chose it is because I became very cynical about things that can be taken away and things that I couldn\u2019t control on my own. And writing \u2013 I can do it 100% by myself. I was insanely obsessed.\u201d</p> <p>Has the Trump presidency provided a creative impetus for him and his peers? \u201cI wrote this book before I thought it was even possible for someone like Donald Trump to become president,\u201d he says flatly. \u201cHe\u2019s definitely a symptom, but now you can\u2019t ignore it. He says and does terrible things. He\u2019s an unrepentant misogynist in obvious ways that are trackable and traceable and recorded. He isn\u2019t interested in pretending to be a good person by the normal standard \u2026 What is scary, in a way, is that even if he got destroyed [in the 2020 presidential elections], it doesn\u2019t mean the problem is gone.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s unlikely that the truths of Adjei-Brenyah\u2019s stories will reach the audiences that might need them the most, but he is clear that neither artists \u201cor policymakers [should be] pandering to the worst people, who don\u2019t even view black people as humans in the same light as them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2e3f0b68cb35e3a457c45f32f3738f4f2e46a4d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e3f0b68cb35e3a457c45f32f3738f4f2e46a4d3/0_43_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A protest against the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in 2016, in New York City.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A protest against the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in 2016, in New York City.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want [this book] to preach just to the choir and actually, I know I\u2019m not. Like, in the literary world, the choir is not even exactly what I think it is because you go in any literary room anywhere and you\u2019ll get: \u2018Oh wow, we care so much. It\u2019s racism and this, that and the other\u2019.\u201d He smiles apologetically and looks at the busy open-plan office space beyond the glass wall of his publisher\u2019s office. \u201cBut, like, this room is just as white as anything else.\u201d</p> <p>Adjei-Brenyah was in college at SUNY Albany when Trayvon Martin was murdered. It was a pivotal moment for him; he and a friend created pamphlets and stayed up until 3am distributing them across campus. \u201cWe were self-righteous \u2026 We fixed racism, you know! We felt we had to galvanise, we woke up expecting to see the new world order we had ushered in.\u201d Nothing happened. \u201cWe saw the janitor sweeping all the pamphlets away. We had pretty much just littered.\u201d He laughs.</p> <p>\u201cI remember not liking it ... but it was good for me. Rather than saying: \u2018This is me and my wisdom and this is how you do it and live your life,\u2019 what I learned is to ask questions instead. Which is when it starts sounding corny \u2026 in that I try to ask important questions.\u201d He does not want to sound grand. \u201cBecause even asking questions creates some kind of truth. You\u2019ve just got to be willing to look at it hard and say something real.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Friday Black is published by riverrun (RRP \u00a38.99) .

      "bodyText": "Meeting famous writers never makes Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah feel \u201cweird or nerdy\u201d, he says. After all, George Saunders was his university tutor and later became a friend. The writer\u2019s writer Lynne Tillman was his mentor. Roxane Gay has stamped a cover quote on Friday Black, his debut short story collection, urging the world simply to \u201cread this book\u201d. Since its publication last autumn, Adjei-Brenyah has had more than enough opportunities to test his reaction to meeting his literary heroes \u2013 moments such as the night in February when he unexpectedly won the book of the year prize at the PEN awards. Zadie Smith was sitting directly behind him as they read his name out. \u201cShe looked so regal and epic \u2013 her aura is so strong. And Zadie Smith had read my book!\u201d Dazed and giggly, the 28-year-old radiates a self-assured, effervescent energy \u2013 albeit one he describes as something of a cover. \u201cI have to be even keel about all [of this], otherwise I will go crazy,\u201d he says. \u201cBefore this book stuff happened, I\u2019d been on a plane like three times in my life \u2026 Now I\u2019m on a plane pretty much every day and it\u2019s wild. It\u2019s really absurd to think that people \u2013 and this is the cool part \u2013 living so far from where I\u2019m from, have read my book and have felt anything about it, you know?\u201d If he weren\u2019t so genuinely excited, this might seem excessively self-effacing. \u201cThis is weird \u2026 Like I\u2019m supposed to come into this room and think this is normal?\u201d It is a small meeting room at his London publisher; the walls are lined with dozens of copies of his book. Adjei-Brenyah is jet lagged, which he blames for being \u201cat least 25% less funny\u201d. Yet all this should be his new normal. Friday Black is stunning. Adjei-Brenyah sets us in a bleak near future, \u201ca world a little bit worse than ours\u201d, he explains, \u201cso maybe, collectively we could imagine a world that was much better\u201d. The dozen stories have been written over the course of eight or nine years, mercilessly revised and chosen by him from a bank of about 80. \u201cLet\u2019s say 70 of those 80 are trash. No, really, they were never going to be anything more than terrible \u2026 An idea is not enough, you could have a thousand good ideas every day. Usually, I have somebody\u2019s voice in my mind for the stories that actually take.\u201d Those stories that did make the final cut have been precisely edited to work together like a concept album; in rhythm and style and beat, Adjei-Brenyah delivers a wildly creative collection that isn\u2019t so much dealing with race, capitalism, violence, poverty, abortion and injustice as it is telling it from the inside out with blood and guts. At his most confident, he is driven by the idea that \u201cmaybe they could help someone feel seen. I thought they could push the conversation in a direction that mattered.\u201d Adjei-Brenyah\u2019s work is often called \u201ctimely\u201d and Friday Black opens with \u201cThe Finkelstein 5\u201d, a visceral account of murdered black children, decapitated by an attacker with a chainsaw. And it doesn\u2019t let up. He imagines a dystopia in which corpses are swept from the floors of Black Friday sales; where aborted twin foetuses, grey and dry, fight each other and compete for affection. In reference to the killer of teenager Trayvon Martin, he creates Zimmer Land: a theme park for white people to act out brutal fantasies against people of colour. Saunders describes the stories in Friday Black as \u201cstrange, crazed, urgent and funny\u201d \u2013 and you can imagine film-makers such as Jordan Peele or Kahlil Joseph putting them on screen. \u201c\u2018Timely\u2019 has come up a lot,\u201d Adjei-Brenyah says, mildly weary. \u201cI think the scary thing is that [these problems have] been there for so long \u2026 there is a certain way of black people being murdered that has become palatable. I want it to be less so.\u201d Friday Black is only considered timely, he says, because the subjects that he has dealt with his whole life have finally reached the mainstream. \u201cMy book is being absorbed the way it is and amplified the way it is because people want to be thinking about these sorts of issues now. \u201cThe fact that people are willing to think about it is good, but the problems that we\u2019re trying to deal with might take a long time to sort out. It\u2019s terrifying to think what will happen at the next election but I think overall, we\u2019re hopefully going to trend towards something better.\u201d At the moment, he is preoccupied with the superrich. He doesn\u2019t understand the accumulation of wealth in a world that is unjustifiably unequal, where one person can be living on the streets while another has 10 homes. \u201cI\u2019m used to being like: \u2018Let me transfer $7 from this account to that account so I can have enough to pull out $20 cash.\u2019 All of a sudden, you win this prize [the PEN award of $75,000] and I can\u2019t even exactly understand ... I feel guilty. I\u2019m like, you know, is anyone allowed to have that at one time? So then, how do these billionaires feel? \u201cIt\u2019s obviously morally wrong. It\u2019s inherently not sustainable.\u201d He looks quizzical, still unknotting the thread. \u201cThe government regulates how much money is in circulation, there is a pot that everyone has to share from, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s coming from nowhere. So you, as [a rich] individual, can be taking someone else\u2019s money, taking from them directly. It\u2019s almost like, what if you had an endless buffet and there\u2019s people starved next to you and you don\u2019t give them food? That is what you\u2019re doing every single day.\u201d As the son of Ghanaian immigrants to the US \u2013 a lawyer father and teacher mother \u2013 whose health and finances both suffered in their new country, Adjei-Brenyah is wary of how good America is at conflating \u201cmorality with things \u2026 like the acquisition of stuff is a duty? It\u2019s weird.\u201d His family moved from Queens, New York, when he was seven years old and settled in Spring Valley, a predominantly immigrant community 22 miles north of Manhattan. \u201cAll it takes is one person getting sick and your house is foreclosed,\u201d he says, recalling what his family went through. \u201cNow you\u2019re getting evicted ... We had a period where we were comfortable \u2013 seeing that change pretty quickly is part of why I am so suspicious.\u201d The time he spent working in retail \u2013 a job he was only able to give up a few years ago \u2013 has also gone some way to shaping his thinking. Now he teaches at Syracuse University where he received his MFA in creative writing. He has just bought his first TV; his first laptop was bought for him by his older sister, well after he had started college and been overwhelmed by \u201call these kids in every class with their MacBooks. \u201cI had no understanding of what it was to be a writer, but I think the reason I chose it is because I became very cynical about things that can be taken away and things that I couldn\u2019t control on my own. And writing \u2013 I can do it 100% by myself. I was insanely obsessed.\u201d Has the Trump presidency provided a creative impetus for him and his peers? \u201cI wrote this book before I thought it was even possible for someone like Donald Trump to become president,\u201d he says flatly. \u201cHe\u2019s definitely a symptom, but now you can\u2019t ignore it. He says and does terrible things. He\u2019s an unrepentant misogynist in obvious ways that are trackable and traceable and recorded. He isn\u2019t interested in pretending to be a good person by the normal standard \u2026 What is scary, in a way, is that even if he got destroyed [in the 2020 presidential elections], it doesn\u2019t mean the problem is gone.\u201d It\u2019s unlikely that the truths of Adjei-Brenyah\u2019s stories will reach the audiences that might need them the most, but he is clear that neither artists \u201cor policymakers [should be] pandering to the worst people, who don\u2019t even view black people as humans in the same light as them. \u201cI don\u2019t want [this book] to preach just to the choir and actually, I know I\u2019m not. Like, in the literary world, the choir is not even exactly what I think it is because you go in any literary room anywhere and you\u2019ll get: \u2018Oh wow, we care so much. It\u2019s racism and this, that and the other\u2019.\u201d He smiles apologetically and looks at the busy open-plan office space beyond the glass wall of his publisher\u2019s office. \u201cBut, like, this room is just as white as anything else.\u201d Adjei-Brenyah was in college at SUNY Albany when Trayvon Martin was murdered. It was a pivotal moment for him; he and a friend created pamphlets and stayed up until 3am distributing them across campus. \u201cWe were self-righteous \u2026 We fixed racism, you know! We felt we had to galvanise, we woke up expecting to see the new world order we had ushered in.\u201d Nothing happened. \u201cWe saw the janitor sweeping all the pamphlets away. We had pretty much just littered.\u201d He laughs. \u201cI remember not liking it ... but it was good for me. Rather than saying: \u2018This is me and my wisdom and this is how you do it and live your life,\u2019 what I learned is to ask questions instead. Which is when it starts sounding corny \u2026 in that I try to ask important questions.\u201d He does not want to sound grand. \u201cBecause even asking questions creates some kind of truth. You\u2019ve just got to be willing to look at it hard and say something real.\u201d \u2022 Friday Black is published by riverrun (RRP \u00a38.99) .

It\u2019s not just the racing industry in California that animal rights activists have set their sights on. \u201cWe\u2019re going to end it, and it\u2019s going to start with California,\u201d Montgomery warned.</p> <p>Indeed, though the latest Santa Anita meet ended last month, the conflagration of criticism that engulfed the track during its six-month run shows no signs of burning out. Those flames have already reached other states like Kentucky, where the catastrophic injury rates at <a href=\"https://www.courier-journal.com/story/sports/horses/horse-racing/2019/04/29/keeneland-horse-fatality-rate-surpassed-average-spring-meet/3622652002/\">Keeneland</a> and <a href=\"https://www.courier-journal.com/story/sports/horses/horse-racing/2019/03/27/churchill-downs-horse-fatalities/3284846002/\">Churchill Downs</a> in years past have come under renewed scrutiny. The racing calendar has already moved onto Del Mar and Saratoga \u2013 two boutique summer meets that have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/08/racehorse-deaths-us-tracks-fatalities\">courted attention in prior years</a> due to spikes in fatalities \u2013 and many in the sport are on tenterhooks.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m scared to death,\u201d says Arthur Hancock, owner of Stone Farm in Kentucky. Hancock is part of the <a href=\"https://www.waterhayoatsalliance.com/\">Water Hay Oats Alliance</a> (WHOA), a group of industry leaders pushing for a federal medication governing body, overseen by the US Anti-Doping Agency (more on this later). But Hancock says that his fears for the long-term health of the racing industry in the US are shared by some, but not all. \u201cI think there\u2019s sort of a general apathy, and I don\u2019t know where it comes from,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Others have a slightly different take. Iowa-based Maggi Moss, a former winning-most owner in the country, says that events in the Golden State don\u2019t necessarily give other jurisdictions immediate cause for concern. \u201cI look at what\u2019s happening in California as an island unto its own at the moment,\u201d Moss says. <a href=\"https://www.thoroughbredracing.com/articles/moss-get-rid-people-who-cheat-and-hurt-horses/\">A passionate advocate for racehorse aftercare and drug reform</a>, Moss also believes that some of the equine welfare reforms the state has implemented in recent months \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.thoroughbreddailynews.com/amid-intense-scrutiny-chrb-advances-four-welfare-rule-changes/\">like tightened medications restrictions</a> \u2013 are to be applauded.</p> <p>\u201cIs it too late?\u201d she adds. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/22/jerry-hollendorfer-banned-santa-anita-horse-death\">Hall of Fame trainer banned from Santa Anita after latest horse death</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So what would happen if racing went the way of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/may/22/ringling-bros-barnum-bailey-circus-final-show\">Ringling Bros and Barnum &amp; Bailey circus</a>? For one thing, the financial threads of the horse racing industry are woven deep into the country\u2019s economic tissue, giving employment, directly or indirectly, to nearly half a million individuals.</p> <p>The industry in California alone supports 17,798 jobs, adds $1.56bn \u201cin value\u201d to the state\u2019s economy, and has a near $2.5bn economic impact, according to the American Horse Council (AHC). <a href=\"http://www.chrb.ca.gov/annual_reports/2018_annual_report.pdf\">According to the CHRB\u2019s own figures</a>, over $3bn was wagered on the racing industry in California alone during the 2017-18 fiscal year. Nationally, <a href=\"https://www.equinebusinessassociation.com/2017-economic-impact-study-u-s-horse-industry/\">the AHC puts the racing sector\u2019s economic impact</a> at around $36.6bn.

It ignores things like boarding, and other aspects of the industry.\u201d</p> <p>Yet understandably for many, economic considerations play second fiddle to the ethical concerns \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.thoroughbredracing.com/articles/racings-social-license-operate-what-can-we-do-keep-it-sustainable/\">issues the public</a> has taken to heart \u2013 that continue to evade wholesale industry action: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/08/racehorse-deaths-us-tracks-fatalities\">too many horses continue to die</a> on US racetracks, too many horses continue to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/17/racings-efforts-to-grapple-with-horse-slaughter-not-enough-at-least-for-now\">funneled into the slaughter pipeline</a>, and too many <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/28/horse-racing-corticosteroid-joint-injections-drug-debate-issue\">drugs continue to be used without adequate regulatory oversight</a>. Is major reform now likely?</p> <p>\u201cI will say it seems to be a strong catalyst for the industry to take the steps necessary to improve equine health,\u201d wrote Jockey Club president and COO, Jim Gagliano, in an email. \u201cThere is a strong feeling that the sport is at a tipping point and comprehensive changes are being addressed,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Most, if not all in the industry, are quick to identify the nexus of that change. \u201cIf it were not clear before, it should be clear to all of us in racing that horse fatalities are the number one threat to our future and we can let nothing deter us from searching out and eradicating every potential risk to that occurring,\u201d wrote National Thoroughbred Racing Association (NTRA) president and CEO, Alex Waldrop, in a response to questions.</p> <p>Skeptics, however, say the industry has had ample opportunity for change. For decades prominent figures within the sport and without have made impassioned pleas for reform. What\u2019s more, the industry has proven time and time again that it understands what steps need to be taken to make the sport safer. Just take Del Mar. <a href=\"http://www.thoroughbreddailynews.com/del-mar-sees-progress-from-safety-initiatives/\">Three years ago, the track instituted a series of reforms</a> that dramatically slashed the number of fatal equine injuries. <a href=\"http://tharacing.com/palmer-risk-management-program/\">New York has reduced the collective catastrophic injury rate</a> at its three venues by 50% since 2012.</p> <p>So how does the industry make these changes broad-based and lasting? The answer is bound-up within a tangled philosophical and legal debate at the heart of the nation\u2019s governing ethos: states\u2019 rights versus federal law. Added to the mix is the issue of individual rights (like those belonging to certain privately-owned racetracks).</p> <p>Medication reform is a prime example. Organizations like the Jockey Club and WHOA have thrown their weight behind the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1754\">Horseracing Integrity Act</a>, a federal bill that will centralize drug reform. Others, like the Association of Racing Commissioners International (ARCI), take the piecemeal approach though the <a href=\"https://rmtcnet.com/national-uniform-medication-program/\">National Uniform Medication Program</a> (NUMP).</p> <p>Up until June, states representing 95% of pari-mutuel handle had adopted in full the program\u2019s controlled therapeutic substances model rule. But the forward momentum of the NUMP recently hit a bump. <a href=\"https://www.paulickreport.com/news/the-biz/california-commissioners-unanimously-vote-to-withdraw-from-rci/\">That\u2019s because the CHRB voted last month to withdraw</a> from the ARCI, arguing that some of the reforms the state has instituted go further than the organization\u2019s current model rules.</p> <p>A number of state-wide changes implemented in California followed measures first implemented by The Stronach Group (TSG) at Santa Anita this spring. \u201cI think they\u2019ve made the most significant change in racing in the last generation,\u201d says People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) spokesperson Kathy Guillermo. \u201cThey [TSG] were a little bit slow to do that, but once they got started, they moved forward very aggressively.\u201d</p> <p>The steps taken appeared to have a marked impact. No horses were fatally injured at the track for a period of nearly six weeks, though a small cluster of fatalities towards the end of the meet removed much of the shine from that record. Many see Peta\u2019s role in the ongoing debate as contentious, confused by the influence of an organization that has long voiced its bitter opposition to horse racing. On one hand, Guillermo <a href=\"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/opinion/story/2019-07-12/commentary-why-horse-racing-needs-new-rules-to-survive\">appears to have offered an olive branch</a> if the sport continues to improve its welfare record. But the immediate question many California race-trackers wonder is this: if the state makes further inroads into tackling catastrophic breakdowns, would Peta support the industry if a racing ban made it onto the state ballot? Guillermo evades a definitive answer.</p> <p>\u201cI think we\u2019d have to figure that out at the time,\u201d she says. \u201cA ballot initiative is very difficult to pass. It is a lot easier to pass regulations and reforms that are going to mean horses don\u2019t suffer so much.\u201d</p>",

Saavedra describes her involvement in the sport \u2013 a world as far removed from the office 9-to-5 as Mercury is from Neptune \u2013 as her \u201cpassion\u201d. A way of life that\u2019s \u201cmore than just a job\u201d, she says. The sword of Damocles hanging over horse racing appears no idle threat. \u201cCalifornians will end horse racing at the ballot box,\u201d promised animal rights activist, April Montgomery, at a California Horse Racing Board (CHRB) meeting in May. It\u2019s not just the racing industry in California that animal rights activists have set their sights on. \u201cWe\u2019re going to end it, and it\u2019s going to start with California,\u201d Montgomery warned. Indeed, though the latest Santa Anita meet ended last month, the conflagration of criticism that engulfed the track during its six-month run shows no signs of burning out. Those flames have already reached other states like Kentucky, where the catastrophic injury rates at Keeneland and Churchill Downs in years past have come under renewed scrutiny. The racing calendar has already moved onto Del Mar and Saratoga \u2013 two boutique summer meets that have courted attention in prior years due to spikes in fatalities \u2013 and many in the sport are on tenterhooks. \u201cI\u2019m scared to death,\u201d says Arthur Hancock, owner of Stone Farm in Kentucky. Hancock is part of the Water Hay Oats Alliance (WHOA), a group of industry leaders pushing for a federal medication governing body, overseen by the US Anti-Doping Agency (more on this later). But Hancock says that his fears for the long-term health of the racing industry in the US are shared by some, but not all. \u201cI think there\u2019s sort of a general apathy, and I don\u2019t know where it comes from,\u201d he says. Others have a slightly different take. Iowa-based Maggi Moss, a former winning-most owner in the country, says that events in the Golden State don\u2019t necessarily give other jurisdictions immediate cause for concern. \u201cI look at what\u2019s happening in California as an island unto its own at the moment,\u201d Moss says. A passionate advocate for racehorse aftercare and drug reform, Moss also believes that some of the equine welfare reforms the state has implemented in recent months \u2013 like tightened medications restrictions \u2013 are to be applauded. \u201cIs it too late?\u201d she adds. \u201cMaybe.\u201d So what would happen if racing went the way of the Ringling Bros and Barnum &amp; Bailey circus? For one thing, the financial threads of the horse racing industry are woven deep into the country\u2019s economic tissue, giving employment, directly or indirectly, to nearly half a million individuals. The industry in California alone supports 17,798 jobs, adds $1.56bn \u201cin value\u201d to the state\u2019s economy, and has a near $2.5bn economic impact, according to the American Horse Council (AHC). According to the CHRB\u2019s own figures, over $3bn was wagered on the racing industry in California alone during the 2017-18 fiscal year. Nationally, the AHC puts the racing sector\u2019s economic impact at around $36.6bn. The connective economic ties between states add another layer. If Californians suddenly stopped buying horses at the Fasig-Tipton and Keeneland sales in Kentucky, the resulting impact on Kentucky\u2019s economy would be a loss of between $87 and $116 million, according to Steven Vickner, an associate professor in the University of Louisville College of Business\u2019s equine industry program. \u201cThat range is the lower bound of economic impact on the state,\u201d says Vickner, emphasizing how his calculations take into consideration a narrow set of factors that a racing ban in California might have. \u201cIt ignores things like wagering. It ignores things like boarding, and other aspects of the industry.\u201d Yet understandably for many, economic considerations play second fiddle to the ethical concerns \u2013 issues the public has taken to heart \u2013 that continue to evade wholesale industry action: too many horses continue to die on US racetracks, too many horses continue to be funneled into the slaughter pipeline, and too many drugs continue to be used without adequate regulatory oversight. Is major reform now likely? \u201cI will say it seems to be a strong catalyst for the industry to take the steps necessary to improve equine health,\u201d wrote Jockey Club president and COO, Jim Gagliano, in an email. \u201cThere is a strong feeling that the sport is at a tipping point and comprehensive changes are being addressed,\u201d he added. Most, if not all in the industry, are quick to identify the nexus of that change. \u201cIf it were not clear before, it should be clear to all of us in racing that horse fatalities are the number one threat to our future and we can let nothing deter us from searching out and eradicating every potential risk to that occurring,\u201d wrote National Thoroughbred Racing Association (NTRA) president and CEO, Alex Waldrop, in a response to questions. Skeptics, however, say the industry has had ample opportunity for change. For decades prominent figures within the sport and without have made impassioned pleas for reform. What\u2019s more, the industry has proven time and time again that it understands what steps need to be taken to make the sport safer. Just take Del Mar. Three years ago, the track instituted a series of reforms that dramatically slashed the number of fatal equine injuries. New York has reduced the collective catastrophic injury rate at its three venues by 50% since 2012. So how does the industry make these changes broad-based and lasting? The answer is bound-up within a tangled philosophical and legal debate at the heart of the nation\u2019s governing ethos: states\u2019 rights versus federal law. Added to the mix is the issue of individual rights (like those belonging to certain privately-owned racetracks). Medication reform is a prime example. Organizations like the Jockey Club and WHOA have thrown their weight behind the Horseracing Integrity Act, a federal bill that will centralize drug reform. Others, like the Association of Racing Commissioners International (ARCI), take the piecemeal approach though the National Uniform Medication Program (NUMP). Up until June, states representing 95% of pari-mutuel handle had adopted in full the program\u2019s controlled therapeutic substances model rule. But the forward momentum of the NUMP recently hit a bump. That\u2019s because the CHRB voted last month to withdraw from the ARCI, arguing that some of the reforms the state has instituted go further than the organization\u2019s current model rules. A number of state-wide changes implemented in California followed measures first implemented by The Stronach Group (TSG) at Santa Anita this spring. \u201cI think they\u2019ve made the most significant change in racing in the last generation,\u201d says People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) spokesperson Kathy Guillermo. \u201cThey [TSG] were a little bit slow to do that, but once they got started, they moved forward very aggressively.\u201d The steps taken appeared to have a marked impact. No horses were fatally injured at the track for a period of nearly six weeks, though a small cluster of fatalities towards the end of the meet removed much of the shine from that record. Many see Peta\u2019s role in the ongoing debate as contentious, confused by the influence of an organization that has long voiced its bitter opposition to horse racing. On one hand, Guillermo appears to have offered an olive branch if the sport continues to improve its welfare record. But the immediate question many California race-trackers wonder is this: if the state makes further inroads into tackling catastrophic breakdowns, would Peta support the industry if a racing ban made it onto the state ballot? Guillermo evades a definitive answer. \u201cI think we\u2019d have to figure that out at the time,\u201d she says. \u201cA ballot initiative is very difficult to pass. It is a lot easier to pass regulations and reforms that are going to mean horses don\u2019t suffer so much.\u201d",

He said the Boris bounce was good news for the Conservatives but not yet \u201cgood enough or substantial enough\u201d for Johnson to call an election. James Cleverly, the Conservative party chairman, said the result was disappointing but he highlighted the fact the Lib Dems had only won on the back of an \u201cunofficial coalition\u201d. \u201cWhat we saw was a very close result in a byelection where the Lib Dems were expecting to romp home comfortably,\u201d he said. In her acceptance speech, Dodds said: \u201cI am incredibly humbled by the support. From every walk of life and every political persuasion, people have chosen to believe in my positive liberal vision for something better. \u201cAnd by backing that liberal vision, people in Brecon and Radnorshire have sent a powerful message to Westminster: we demand better.\u201d She continued: \u201cPeople are desperately crying out for a different kind of politics. There is no time for tribalism when our country is faced with a Boris Johnson government and the threat of a no-deal Brexit. \u201cMy very first act as your MP when I arrive in Westminster will be to find Mr Boris Johnson, wherever he\u2019s hiding, and tell him loud and clear: stop playing with the futures of our communities and rule out a no-deal Brexit.\u201d The byelection in mid-Wales was called after Davies was ousted from parliament when he was found guilty of submitting a false expenses claim. Despite the scandal, he was chosen to stand again. After the result, Davies congratulated Dodds and wished her well for the future. He also paid tribute to his family, saying they had experienced \u201ca difficult time over the past few months\u201d. Earlier, he said his party had run a \u201cclean and positive\u201d campaign but added: \u201cSadly a few of our competitors have led a dirty campaign.\u201d Davies had occupied the seat for the Conservatives since 2015. The Lib Dems held it from 1997 to 2015.",

United\u2019s latest offer, of \u00a370m plus some bells and whistles, was some way from Leicester\u2019s extraordinary evaluation (which is widely quoted at \u00a385m though today\u2019s Times \u201ccan reveal that they want even more for the defender, demanding \u00a395m with \u00a385m up front and a further \u00a310m in add-ons\u201d). Thus the player is marooned and feeling frustrated, per the Telegraph, \u201cthat his professional behaviour has not persuaded Leicester to reach a compromise\u201d.</p> <p>Meanwhile United want <strong>Sean Longstaff</strong> but value him at half Newcastle\u2019s \u00a350m asking price, and want to sell <strong>Romelu Lukaku</strong> but value him at nearly twice Internazionale\u2019s \u00a354m highest offer, all of which suggests there\u2019s a lot of optimistic valuation going on. And <strong>Real Madrid</strong> still haven\u2019t made a genuine move for <strong>Paul Pogba</strong>, with both Marca and AS having large pictures of <strong>Donny van de Beek</strong> dominating their front page, agreeing that Real Madrid plan to turn to the \u20ac60m-rated Dutchman should their efforts to sign the maverick Frenchman come to nought.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B0ow-hrHZK6/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

      "bodyText": "Manchester United\u2019s pursuit of Harry Maguire seems to be coming to some kind of conclusion, with the player left out of Leicester\u2019s friendly against Atalanta this evening because he is currently occupying the wrong headspace. United\u2019s latest offer, of \u00a370m plus some bells and whistles, was some way from Leicester\u2019s extraordinary evaluation (which is widely quoted at \u00a385m though today\u2019s Times \u201ccan reveal that they want even more for the defender, demanding \u00a395m with \u00a385m up front and a further \u00a310m in add-ons\u201d). Thus the player is marooned and feeling frustrated, per the Telegraph, \u201cthat his professional behaviour has not persuaded Leicester to reach a compromise\u201d. Meanwhile United want Sean Longstaff but value him at half Newcastle\u2019s \u00a350m asking price, and want to sell Romelu Lukaku but value him at nearly twice Internazionale\u2019s \u00a354m highest offer, all of which suggests there\u2019s a lot of optimistic valuation going on. And Real Madrid still haven\u2019t made a genuine move for Paul Pogba, with both Marca and AS having large pictures of Donny van de Beek dominating their front page, agreeing that Real Madrid plan to turn to the \u20ac60m-rated Dutchman should their efforts to sign the maverick Frenchman come to nought. The top news story in Tuttosport is the imminent full-back exchange that will see Jo\u00e3o Cancelo head for Manchester City and Danilo plus \u20ac30m in cold, hard cash come in the other direction. Fabio Paratici, the Italian club\u2019s general manager, \u201chas been fully immersed in English for days,\u201d they report, \u201cbetween telephone conversations conducted in the language of Shakespeare and trips to London, where he headed yesterday for the second time in a week\u201d. While there he was apparently discussing the sale of Mattia Perin to Aston Villa (presumably unsuccessfully, as they signed Tom Heaton yesterday), monitoring Arsenal and Wolves\u2019 interest in Sami Khedira and negotiating with United over both Paulo Dybala and, somewhat more surprisingly, Mario Mandzukic. Sporting have rejected a \u20ac50m offer from Tottenham for Bruno Fernandes, according to A Bola, but the Mirror reports that Spurs \u201chave now sent two senior officials to Lisbon to try and finalise a deal\u201d, armed according to the Mail with permission to bid \u00a356m (though, according to the Telegraph, \u201cthere remains the possibility that Manchester United will spring into action and lodge their own bid now that Tottenham have sent a delegation to Portugal\u201d). Tottenham\u2019s move, says the Mirror, comes after they reluctantly give up on signing their first-choice midfielder, Real Betis\u2019s Giovani Lo Celso, who would cost around \u00a370m. But the Sun says they still plan to make \u201ca last push\u201d for the Argentinian, who they report could be signed for a mere \u00a360m. Manchester City are demanding that Bayern Munich pay them \u00a3145m (the Sun) or \u00a3137m (Telegraph/Times) if they are to sell Leroy San\u00e9. \u201cReports in Germany,\u201d the Telegraph continue, \u201chave claimed Bayern are preparing a bid of around \u00a373m.\u201d So good luck with that. Liverpool are considering a \u00a320m bid for Bordeaux\u2019s Fran\u00e7ois Kamano, a 23-year-old Guinean striker who scored 13 goals in 51 appearances last season, who J\u00fcrgen Klopp hopes will reduce the burden on his first-choice front three while also being relatively cheap. Also shopping in France are Newcastle, who hope to conclude deals for Paris St-Germain\u2019s Moussa Sissako and Nice\u2019s Allan Saint-Maximin before the end of this very day, and have bid \u00a311m for another PSG youngster, the full-back Stanley N\u2019Soki.

Her fan club expects a tough, criminal justice-led approach that will reclaim the Conservatives\u2019 reputation as the party of law and order. If so, she will be the wrong home secretary to tackle the surge in youth violence.</p> <p>The hard right are looking forward to a return to the tried-and-failed approach of searching, arresting and imprisoning our way out of trouble, but the evidence points to the need for prevention and early intervention by a range of state agencies.</p> <p>In the year to March 2019, police forces in England and Wales recorded <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/18/knife-crime-england-wales-police\">more than 47,000 offences involving knives</a>, up 8% on the previous year and the highest total since records began. In the year to March 2018, 285 people in England and Wales were stabbed to death. The number of juvenile offenders convicted or cautioned for knife offences has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jun/13/knife-and-offensive-weapon-offences-england-wales-reach-highest-level-for-decade\">increased by 48% in four years.</a> Figures from eight of the largest police forces reveal that stop and search has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/jul/07/england-sees-surge-in-stop-and-search-as-police-battle-knife-crime\">more than doubled in two years</a>. In the first nine weeks of 2019, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/mar/04/knife-victims-10-teenagers-killed-in-2019\">10 teenagers were stabbed to death</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/31/action-on-rise-in-youth-violence-completely-inadequate-say-mps\">Action on rise in youth violence completely inadequate, say MPs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Against this blood-soaked backdrop, the cross-party home affairs select committee has published its <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmhaff/1016/1016.pdf\">report on serious youth violence</a>. This wide-ranging and thoughtful analysis describes the recent rises in youth violence as a social emergency, requiring concerted state action at local, regional and national level. It dismisses the government\u2019s serious violence strategy \u2013 almost devoid of clear actions, targets and accountability \u2013 as \u201ccompletely inadequate\u201d.</p> <p>Key recommendations include agencies working together to help safeguard children from risks outside the home, such as exploitation by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/17/teens-county-lines-gangs\">county lines gangs</a>, increasing the confidence of young people from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds in the police, and providing dedicated police support to schools in high-risk areas.</p> <p>Crucially, the MPs highlight the strong evidence linking deprivation and vulnerability with knife crime and serious youth violence.

      "bodyText": "Priti Patel is being hailed as the \u201chardest line home secretary for years\u201d. Her fan club expects a tough, criminal justice-led approach that will reclaim the Conservatives\u2019 reputation as the party of law and order. If so, she will be the wrong home secretary to tackle the surge in youth violence. The hard right are looking forward to a return to the tried-and-failed approach of searching, arresting and imprisoning our way out of trouble, but the evidence points to the need for prevention and early intervention by a range of state agencies. In the year to March 2019, police forces in England and Wales recorded more than 47,000 offences involving knives, up 8% on the previous year and the highest total since records began. In the year to March 2018, 285 people in England and Wales were stabbed to death. The number of juvenile offenders convicted or cautioned for knife offences has increased by 48% in four years. Figures from eight of the largest police forces reveal that stop and search has more than doubled in two years. In the first nine weeks of 2019, 10 teenagers were stabbed to death. Against this blood-soaked backdrop, the cross-party home affairs select committee has published its report on serious youth violence. This wide-ranging and thoughtful analysis describes the recent rises in youth violence as a social emergency, requiring concerted state action at local, regional and national level. It dismisses the government\u2019s serious violence strategy \u2013 almost devoid of clear actions, targets and accountability \u2013 as \u201ccompletely inadequate\u201d. Key recommendations include agencies working together to help safeguard children from risks outside the home, such as exploitation by county lines gangs, increasing the confidence of young people from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds in the police, and providing dedicated police support to schools in high-risk areas. Crucially, the MPs highlight the strong evidence linking deprivation and vulnerability with knife crime and serious youth violence. They argue that the current surge has been exacerbated by a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of cuts to youth services and policing, growing numbers of children excluded from school and taken into care, and a failure of statutory agencies to keep young people safe. It talks about youth outreach workers and community projects co-designed with local young people. It highlights the importance of giving young people safe places to go, and demands urgent action to tackle school exclusions and shortcomings in pupil referral units. Crashing into this complex latticework of causes and solutions is the new standard bearer for the right, Patel. Her supporters are slavering at the prospect of finally purging the memory of Theresa May restricting the use of stop and search, confidently predicting Patel will \u201cwin the war on crime\u201d. They want to see the home secretary come down hard on recreational cannabis use, ramp up stop and search, give longer sentences \u2013 to arrest our way out of the problem. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, told the first meeting of the new national policing board that the answer to the surge in violent crime is \u201cstrong, visible policing\u201d. If Patel\u2019s approach to tackling youth violence is to pursue these simplistic policies, she will fail to get a grip on the problem long-term. For example, while appropriate use of stop and search has its place, Home Office research and analysis by the College of Policing demonstrate that targeted weapons searches in London have had little, if any, impact on overall crime rates. New York City police used stop-and-frisk 686,000 times in 2011. Since then, the tactic has been all but abandoned while crime has dropped sharply. That does not prove that ending stop and search would cut violent youth crime, but it is surely convincing evidence that simply ramping up searches will not solve the problem. From the US to Glasgow, there is powerful evidence that tackling youth violence requires a concerted, sustained effort to address the root causes, alongside effective policing.

But what is lacking is variety. So often what we are given is saccharine<strong> </strong>(Boys on the Side, Mystic Pizza,<strong> </strong>Fried Green Tomatoes) or girls behaving badly (Bridesmaids, Girls\u2019 Night).</p> <p>Traditionally, Hollywood has had a major issue with close female friendships. Viewed through a male gaze, it has been jazzed up with a bit of psycho-bitchery or lesbianism. The early 90s gave us the outrageously unfeminist Single White Female (your flatmate loves you so much she kills your dog and rams a stiletto into your boyfriend\u2019s eye) and The Hand that Rocks the Cradle (begins with a male sexual predator, but quickly turns into the story of a female homicidal maniac). You could position Killing Eve in this schlockily entertaining lineage \u2013 but, refreshingly, the erotic frisson between Eve and sociopathic assassin Villanelle has nothing to do with guys.</p> <p>Shelley Cobb, a film historian at the University of Southampton, points out that in Hollywood, friendship between women is usually \u201ccurtailed or contained by men\u201d \u2013 inevitably relegated to a secondary relationship in the march to the happy-ever-after ending of marriage. \u201cThat\u2019s why many female friendship films are set in the teenage years and 20s. In the end, the friendship always has to be subordinated to maturity, which usually is signalled by marriage, but also by motherhood, and sometimes the death of one of the friends that sets the others on to the path of adulthood.\u201d</p> <p>Cobb adds: \u201cWhether explicitly or not, female friendship is always seen as a threat to the patriarchy, and the structure of film plots and the insistent heterosexuality of Hollywood requires that the threat be contained. Usually marriage is the answer, because most female friendship films are set when women are single and fairly young.\u201d</p> <p>Sticking two fingers up at the patriarchy, today\u2019s writers are ditching love and marriage as their happy endings. Instead, the finishing line for their female protagonists is independence and a sense of identity from work.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"48860722b1e070a56f4638db0861f84d36f83555\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48860722b1e070a56f4638db0861f84d36f83555/0_0_3504_2336/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever in Booksmart.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever in Booksmart.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fran\u00e7ois Duhamel/Allstar/Annapurna Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Animals, Laura (Grainger) has been tinkering away at a novel for a decade and is getting panicky at the thought that her career as a writer is never going to happen. There is a love interest \u2013 two, in fact \u2013 but her real dilemma is ambition versus getting wasted every night. Greta Gerwig\u2019s Frances Ha, a Woody Allen-ish love story about the ebb and flow of a female friendship, ends similarly \u2013 with work fulfilment not love. When I interviewed Gerwig a few years ago, she told me that she began writing scripts in frustration at the twentysomething female roles she was being offered: \u201cThey fall in love or they fall out of love. It\u2019s like: Where are the films about female friendship or ambition?\u201d Frances Ha fixed that, and Gerwig made her directing debut with Lady Bird, a teen movie in which the heroine\u2019s really meaningful relationships are with women \u2013 her best friends and her mum.</p> <p>If you want to be picky about Animals, some of the hedonistic scenes feel a bit try-hard. But the joy of the film is that it doesn\u2019t punish Laura or Tyler for their wild ways. In time, they may decide to grow up and become proper adults, but they regret nothing. Getting trashed is fun, and meaningless sex can be just that, meaningless. And here the film really does break new ground.</p> <p>Hyde proudly tells me about a comment from someone in an audience: \u201cThey said: \u2018I just want to thank you for not killing one of the characters off, having them OD or step in front of a bus or something.\u201d One of Hyde\u2019s bugbears in films is the female character having a dramatic wake-up call. \u201cYou know, at the end of the film she takes a bottle of alcohol and tips it down the sink as if that\u2019s cleaning up her life. That\u2019s so black and white. The truth is we don\u2019t all have this moment of revelation.\u201d</p> <p>Does she have any offending films in mind? Hyde laughs. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I should say it, but I was super-excited when Trainwreck came out. Amy Schumer is so great. But it was exactly that moment. She tips out the booze and dresses like a cheerleader. And I just felt really unsatisfied by that idea that convention is the answer. It might be for some people, but it isn\u2019t for me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"07916b71858d44a647c60390af0660dc09027d85\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07916b71858d44a647c60390af0660dc09027d85/0_0_2992_1995/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis in Thelma And Louise.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis in Thelma And Louise.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MGM/Everett/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So, are the gatekeepers of cinema finally wising up to the audience demand for honest portrayals of women and their friendships? Animals premiered at Sundance in January to positive reviews, but has yet to find a US distributor. What is the problem, I ask. Is it the messy female characters, the sex, or the booze? Hyde laughs. \u201cAll of the above. I think it\u2019s all those things. In the US, there was a bit of a question about the drinking, whether they were addicts, which is very American. And some people find the characters abrasive.\u201d</p> <p>Bonnie-Chance Roberts, who is in her late 20s, is a co-producer on the forthcoming film of Caitlin Moran\u2019s novel How to Build a Girl, starring Emma Thompson and Booksmart\u2019s Beanie Feldstein. Does she agree that TV made by women of her generation is shaking up film industry attitudes to female stories? \u201cYes. There\u2019s definitely been a change in the last few years. I think that\u2019s also because of the #MeToo movement. People are tearing down walls.\u201d</p> <p>She also believes there is more opportunity for women than ever before: \u201cOn the producing side, I feel there\u2019s more space even between my generation and the generation of my bosses. There\u2019s more space for women coming up and that affects the stories being told.\u201d Her bosses are Alison Owen and Debra Hayward, who between them have producer credits on Suffragette, Bridget Jones\u2019s Baby and Atonement.</p> <p>What is interesting when talking to Roberts is how much of Hollywood conventional wisdom she rejects. It is often taken as a given that men won\u2019t go to see a movie with a female protagonist. That is not only outdated, but out of step with her experience, she says. \u201cI have a 21-year-old brother and he went to see Booksmart because he wanted to see it. He didn\u2019t think: \u2018That\u2019s a girl\u2019s film.\u2019 It\u2019s changing, especially for younger generations.</p> <p>\u201cHow to Build a Girl is a coming-of-age comedy and we have a female protagonist. Obviously, that\u2019s very important to the identity of the movie but it\u2019s also not just a women\u2019s film. It\u2019s about learning and making mistakes. And figuring out who you are. You can\u2019t identify it purely as a movie for women.\u201d</p> <p>For Roberts, it is about seeing more women\u2019s stories on screen. \u201cWe grew up identifying with the male identity, and there were many shades of that identity. There\u2019s Ferris Bueller or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/26/call-me-by-your-name-review-luca-guadagnino-armie-hammer\" title=\"\">Call Me By Your Name</a>. These movies don\u2019t just look at one part of masculinity. Whereas I think that, traditionally, women\u2019s stories have been told through certain genres, a love story or a tragedy.\u201d</p> <p>What can we expect as this supertalented generation of women creators get older and make content that reflects their experiences of their 40s, 50s and beyond? In Animals, Tyler jokes to Laura that they are destined to grow old together: \u201cOne day it\u2019s just going to be me and you pissing in each other\u2019s beds.\u201d Yet there isn\u2019t a model for friends living together \u2013 society doesn\u2019t sanction wandering hand in hand into the sunset with your best friend. But you know never know. I can\u2019t have been the only one to share with my friends the news story of a group of seven girlfriends in China <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2019/07/seven-female-friends-make-pact-to-retire-together.html\" title=\"\">clubbing together</a> to buy their dream retirement home. So let\u2019s hear it for Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s Golden Girls.</p>",

And some people find the characters abrasive.\u201d Bonnie-Chance Roberts, who is in her late 20s, is a co-producer on the forthcoming film of Caitlin Moran\u2019s novel How to Build a Girl, starring Emma Thompson and Booksmart\u2019s Beanie Feldstein. Does she agree that TV made by women of her generation is shaking up film industry attitudes to female stories? \u201cYes. There\u2019s definitely been a change in the last few years. I think that\u2019s also because of the #MeToo movement. People are tearing down walls.\u201d She also believes there is more opportunity for women than ever before: \u201cOn the producing side, I feel there\u2019s more space even between my generation and the generation of my bosses. There\u2019s more space for women coming up and that affects the stories being told.\u201d Her bosses are Alison Owen and Debra Hayward, who between them have producer credits on Suffragette, Bridget Jones\u2019s Baby and Atonement. What is interesting when talking to Roberts is how much of Hollywood conventional wisdom she rejects. It is often taken as a given that men won\u2019t go to see a movie with a female protagonist. That is not only outdated, but out of step with her experience, she says. \u201cI have a 21-year-old brother and he went to see Booksmart because he wanted to see it. He didn\u2019t think: \u2018That\u2019s a girl\u2019s film.\u2019 It\u2019s changing, especially for younger generations. \u201cHow to Build a Girl is a coming-of-age comedy and we have a female protagonist. Obviously, that\u2019s very important to the identity of the movie but it\u2019s also not just a women\u2019s film. It\u2019s about learning and making mistakes. And figuring out who you are. You can\u2019t identify it purely as a movie for women.\u201d For Roberts, it is about seeing more women\u2019s stories on screen. \u201cWe grew up identifying with the male identity, and there were many shades of that identity. There\u2019s Ferris Bueller or Call Me By Your Name. These movies don\u2019t just look at one part of masculinity. Whereas I think that, traditionally, women\u2019s stories have been told through certain genres, a love story or a tragedy.\u201d What can we expect as this supertalented generation of women creators get older and make content that reflects their experiences of their 40s, 50s and beyond? In Animals, Tyler jokes to Laura that they are destined to grow old together: \u201cOne day it\u2019s just going to be me and you pissing in each other\u2019s beds.\u201d Yet there isn\u2019t a model for friends living together \u2013 society doesn\u2019t sanction wandering hand in hand into the sunset with your best friend. But you know never know. I can\u2019t have been the only one to share with my friends the news story of a group of seven girlfriends in China clubbing together to buy their dream retirement home. So let\u2019s hear it for Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s Golden Girls.",

      "bodyText": "With the summer holidays in full swing you might need a bit of a hand keeping the kids entertained. From tablets and cameras to robot toys and updated old-school favourites, here is a collection of kid-aimed tech to keep the little ones occupied. Robot toys Sphero Mini - \u00a350 There are a lot of robot toys available, but a long-time favourite, Sphero, is my pick. Deceptively simple - a ball that you can remote control using a smartphone or tablet - it has hidden depths with games and educational elements available on further inspection. Here in its latest \u201cmini\u201d form, the Sphero ball is just a lot of fun to drive around and small enough that over-exuberant indoor excursions won\u2019t result in marked up paintwork or broken furniture. The Sphero Play app has games too, but if you want to foster a bit of creative learning the Sphero Edu app is great. Your kids or big kids can learn to program with an easy interface, follow examples and activities, getting the robot to do all sorts of things, or get deeper and write some code for it in JavaScript. Higher-end versions such as the \u00a3100 SPRK+ or \u00a3150 BOLT can take the educational elements to the next level too. If you\u2019re after something a bit simpler, perennial favourite HotWheels has some new mixed-reality experiences in various \u201cid\u201d cars (\u00a37) and tracks (\u00a3160) that record lap records and challenges. Tablets Amazon Fire 7 Kids Edition - \u00a399 While lending them your iPad works well enough, if you want something the little urchins can\u2019t break then the Kids Edition of Amazon\u2019s cheap Fire 7 tablet is worth a look. It comes with a brightly coloured case, which now has a pop-out stand. If your kids manage to break it, Amazon will replace it for free under its two year worry-free guarantee. It does all the standard Android tablet things such as movies, games, a web browser if you want it and parental controls to lock it down, set time limits and age filters. There\u2019s even an option for enabling a web browser that can only access curated kid-safe sites and videos, but it doesn\u2019t have access to the Google Play store, only Amazon\u2019s own app store. The Kids Edition also comes with a one-year subscription to Amazon Fire for Kids Unlimited (\u00a32 to \u00a34 a month afterwards), which is a curated collection of kid-friendly text and audio books, movies, TV shows and educational apps. There\u2019s the larger \u00a3130 Fire HD 8 and \u00a3200 Fire HD 10 versions available too if you want something bigger. Alternatives include LeapFrog\u2019s various educational tablets (\u00a390), which are fine for younger children, Kurio\u2019s Android tablets with Google Play (\u00a340), or hand-me-down or refurbished iPad Minis (\u00a3300) in robust cases, which can be locked down with some parental controls. Cameras Vtech Kidizoom Duo 5.0 - \u00a340 One of the best things about a smartphone is the camera, but if you don\u2019t want your kids to have one just yet, a camera might be the next best thing. The Vtech Kidizoom Duo 5.0 fits the bill as \u201cmy first digital camera\u201d made of rugged plastic and simple operation, which Vtech reckons is suitable for 3-9 year olds. It shoots 5MP photos of reasonable quality, can shoot out the front or the back for selfies, and has a 2.4in screen. It has some fun filters and effects, can shoot video too, and even has an optical viewfinder. Older kids will likely reject the kid-centric nature, but if you want your child to grow up to be an award-winning photographer, this could be a good start. It eats batteries and takes four AAs at a time, so best to buy some rechargeables to go in it, and you\u2019ll need an SD card too. For older kids, traditional camera manufacturers make a variety of more rugged compact models. Highlights include Nikon\u2019s Coolpix W150 (\u00a3150), Panasonic\u2019s Lumix FT30 (\u00a3109) and Fujifilm\u2019s FinePix XP130 (\u00a399), or perhaps an entry-level action camera such as GoPro\u2019s Hero7 White (\u00a3170). Fitness trackers Garmin Vivofit Jr. 2 - \u00a360 Your kid may not need a fitness tracker, but with childhood obesity a serious societal issue, anything that promotes exercise and general activity is a good idea. My pick is the Garmin Vivofit Jr 2, which strikes the right balance between being fun, easy to manage and spanning enough of an age range that they will hopefully want to wear it for more than a week. It\u2019s water resistant to five atmospheres (50m), so swimming is no problem. It has a user replaceable battery that lasts a year, so you don\u2019t have to charge it. There\u2019s a choice of stretchy band or traditional buckle (which appears better) and it\u2019s not too bulky as these things go. A link up with Disney means it comes in a variety of character designs including the ever-popular Spider-man. It tracks steps, activity, sleep, is motivational rather than critical, has mini games to play once your kid has hit their goals and can all be managed from a parent\u2019s phone or tablet so you can keep an eye on their data. Parents can even set goals, competitions with their own activity levels, core reminders and tasks that can earn virtual coins for them to trade for rewards with you. If you\u2019re a Fitbit user yourself, then the firm\u2019s Ace 2 (\u00a370) means you can compete on activity, but it needs charging every four or so days. Other cheaper adult-focused fitness trackers such as the Xiaomi Mi Band 3 (\u00a321) or newer Mi Smart Band 4 (\u00a334) may be better for older children. Walkie tTalkies Binatone Latitude 100 - \u00a322 If you don\u2019t want your kid to have a phone yet, but still want to keep in touch then a two-way radio can be great fun for kids and big kids alike. Stranger Things eat your heart out. There are lots of kid-specific walkie talkies available, but a basic set such as Binatone\u2019s Latitude 100 normally work better. While it quotes a two-mile range, that\u2019s only line of sight in the middle of nowhere, but they should be good for 500m or so in an urban environment. Simple enough to set up, and robust enough to take a tumble, the only downside is you\u2019ll need a small mountain of batteries as they take four AAA each \u2013 so best get some rechargeables. Push to talk with volume control and a belt clip, ready for adventures. Nestling\u2019s camouflage walkie talkies (\u00a324) are also a popular choice, while there are lots of alternatives under \u00a330 available on the high street.",

      "bodyText": "Women in Saudi Arabia will no longer need the permission of a male guardian to travel, according to laws published on Friday, in a key step towards dismantling controls that have made women second-class citizens in their own country. Other changes issued in the decrees allow women to apply for passports, register a marriage, divorce or child\u2019s birth and be issued official family documents. It also stipulates that a father or mother can be legal guardians of children. Being able to obtain family documents could ease hurdles women faced in obtaining a national identity card and enrolling their children in school. Still in place, however, are rules that require male consent for a woman to leave prison, exit a domestic abuse shelter or marry. Women, unlike men, still cannot pass on citizenship to their children and cannot provide consent for their children to marry. Under the kingdom\u2019s guardianship system, women essentially rely on the \u201cgoodwill\u201d and whims of male relatives to determine the course of their lives. Friday\u2019s move comes at a time of increased international scrutiny of women\u2019s status in Saudi Arabia. In recent months, several young women have fled the country and made public pleas for help in seeking asylum from their family and the government. Last year, authorities arrested many of the country\u2019s most prominent female campaigners in a sweeping crackdown on activists. The country\u2019s crown prince and de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, has sought to present himself as a modernist reformer since being appointed heir to the throne in 2017. Critics say the jailing of female activists under his watch and the treatment of dissidents, including Jamal Khashoggi, the journalist who was murdered at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, suggests the regime only wants change on its terms. Prince Mohammed has brought in sweeping social and economic changes, aimed partly at weaning the country off its dependence on oil revenue. He has also dismantled some of the strictest controls over women. Last year, a driving ban was lifted, and rules were altered freeing women from needing permission from a male guardian to study at university, undergo surgery or get a job. The crown prince has also curbed the powers of the religious police, who once pursued women they considered immodestly dressed to check they had a guardian\u2019s permission for their activities. They also broke up mixed-sex gatherings. Those changes were welcomed by activists who say Saudi Arabia\u2019s guardianship system has kept its women in a legal limbo as \u201cperpetual minors\u201d and should be dismantled entirely. Prince Mohammed has also been criticised for Saudi Arabia\u2019s role in Yemen\u2019s brutal civil war, and his relentless pursuit of opponents at home and abroad, most prominently of Khashoggi. A forensic and damning UN report said the crown prince should be investigated over the murder because there was \u201ccredible evidence\u201d that he and other senior officials were liable for the killing. He has denied any involvement. The rules, approved by King Salman and his cabinet, allow any person 21 and older to travel abroad without prior consent and any citizen to apply for a Saudi passport on their own.

      "bodyText": "The UN secretary general has warned that the world has lost \u201can invaluable brake on nuclear war\u201d with the expiry of a cold war-era arms control treaty on Friday. The 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty has kept nuclear missiles off European soil for more than three decades, but the US and Russia have failed to agree on how to keep it alive. \u201cThis will likely heighten, not reduce, the threat posed by ballistic missiles,\u201d Ant\u00f3nio Guterres told reporters, adding that he was concerned about rising tensions between nuclear-armed states. There have already been signs of a rekindled arms race in the class of weapons that the treaty banned: ground-launched missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500km. Nearly 2,700 of the cruise and ballistic nuclear missiles were destroyed under the treaty, removing a potent source of European insecurity. A targeted country would only have a few minutes warning of a launch, fueling paranoia and hair-trigger alerts on both sides of the Iron Curtain. These weapons are now beginning to return. \u201c2 August marks the demise of the INF, which played a major role in enhancing stability in Europe,\u201d said Laura Kennedy, the former US permanent representative to the conference on disarmament in Geneva. \u201cIts termination could be both unsettling in Europe and could lead to new arms competition in other areas, such as Asia.\u201d The death of the INF comes amid aggressive nuclear weapon modernisation programmes being carried out by the US and Russia. Among the new weapons the US is contemplating is a nuclear bunker-buster, considered and then shelved under the George W Bush administration. Russia has developed a land-based nuclear-capable cruise missile, which the US and its Nato allies say violates the INF range restrictions. Moscow initially denied the existence of the missile (known as the 9M729 or by its Nato designation, SSC-8) and then claimed its range was under 500km. It is thought likely to be a land-based version of the Russian navy Kalibr missile. \u201cThey are dual-capable, they can carry nuclear weapons, they can reach European cities within minutes, they are mobile, hard to detect and they also reduce the threshold of any potential use of nuclear weapons in armed conflict,\u201d the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said on Wednesday. Russia\u2019s refusal to scrap the weapon led Donald Trump to withdraw the US from the INF treaty, and the US is now developing at least three types of medium-range missiles, all of them designed for conventional warheads. The first of these, believed to be a land-based version of the Tomahawk cruise missile with a 1,000km range, is due to be tested later this month. A second option, a medium-range ballistic missile, is due to be tested in November, with a range of up to 4,000km. Third, the army is planning to develop a new missile to be mounted on a mobile launcher, either a ballistic weapon or a hypersonic glide vehicle. Pentagon officials have said the first weapon, the cruise missile, could be deployed within 18 months. The prospect of the INF\u2019s demise on Friday is viewed with little enthusiasm among UK officials, not least because the country falls in the range of the previously banned intermediate-range surface-to-surface missiles. \u201cIt is a proper serious moment,\u201d a Whitehall source observed, although there are no plans for the new administration of Boris Johnson to publicly mark the moment. European officials say there has been limited discussion with their US counterparts on Nato policy after INF, in part because European policy was focused on saving the treaty. Now that that has failed, UK officials argued there was unlikely to be an immediate return to a nuclear standoff between rival missile systems in Europe, as witnessed in the 1980s when US cruise and Pershing missiles were ranged against Soviet SS-20s. The new Russian missile is nuclear capable, but not necessarily nuclear armed. They are presently believed to be organised in four battalions, only one of which is west of the Urals, though they are mobile allowing for rapid redeployment. The US missiles are, for now, strictly conventional and Nato has said it has no intention of deploying nuclear missiles in Europe. \u201cWe will not mirror what Russia is doing,\u201d Stoltenberg said. Furthermore, the Democratic majority leadership in the House of Representatives is opposed to the new US missiles, arguing there is no sign of a coherent strategy behind them, and has removed the $96m research and development budget for them from the House 2020 budget. The fate of the programmes now depends on the reconciliation process between the House and Senate versions. It is unclear where a US cruise missile would be based. They would have to be located in eastern Europe to be in range of Russian targets, but one of Washington\u2019s closest allies in the region, Poland, has insisted there would have to be unanimous Nato support for their deployment, which is unlikely. \u201cAny US attempt to force the alliance to accept the missiles or to go around Nato and try to negotiate a bilateral agreement with an individual Nato member would be a significant source of division within Nato and one Russia would be eager to try and exploit,\u201d said Kingston Reif, the director for disarmament and threat reduction policy at the Arms Control Association. Administration hawks led by John Bolton, the US national security adviser, are also eyeing a possible Pacific deployment as a counter to Chinese medium-range missiles. The fact that China was outside the INF was one of the reasons cited by Bolton and others in their opposition to the treaty.

The year-to-date temperatures from January to July were the second warmest on record, according to a monthly statement from the Bureau of Meteorology. Rainfall recorded during that period is the fifth lowest on record, with the drought worst in New South Wales, southern Queensland, and eastern and central Victoria. The mean maximum temperature in July was 2.23C above average \u2013 the third highest mean maximum temperature for July behind 2017 and 2018. The warm winter follows Australia\u2019s hottest ever summer. Global temperatures for July were on track to make it the hottest month ever recorded, following the hottest June ever recorded. The fire service in New South Wales has announced a historic early start to the declared bushfire danger period in two local government areas along the far south coast, Eurobodalla and the Bega Valley. Ten more regions in the northeast and mid-north coast \u2013 Inverell, Tenterfield, Glen Innes Severn, Armidale, Uralla, Walcha, Nambucca, Kempsey, Port Macquarie Hastings, and the Mid-Coast region \u2013 were also declared to be in a bushfire danger period from 1 August. Rob Rogers, acting commissioner of the NSW rural fire service, said the fire season had been brought forward due to very dry and warm conditions across most of the state. About 98% of NSW is in a declared drought. \u201cLast season we saw more fires in July and August than the whole of summer combined,\u201d Rogers said in a statement. Fire authorities in Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia are yet to declare the start of their fire danger periods, but both SA and Victoria are expected to do so earlier than normal. Historically, the fire season ran from November to March in the southern half of the country, and October to March in NSW. In recent years, the fire season, during which there are restrictions on burn-offs or lighting fires on private land, has been extended in all jurisdictions. The Murray Darling Basin Authority has also issued a grim outlook for the Murray Darling, warning that it expects to manage the river system for very dry conditions. Most dams are already very low and the authority does not expect to be able to draw any water from the Menindee Lakes in the coming year, which means the Lower Darling will depend totally on flows from upstream. The storages are now at 32% on average, but in the northern basin, dam levels average just 9%.

After all, it only took about seven years of flogging my own selfhood on the internet to get to a place where I could comfortably afford to stop using Amazon to save fifteen minutes and five dollars at a time\u201d. That\u2019s from a particularly direct assault on the way we live now, The Story of a Generation in Seven Scams: the first scam is the one that caused the 2007/8 financial crisis, the last is Trump\u2019s rise to power, and in between she also takes down an insidious breed of \u201cmarket-friendly feminism\u201d that she notes is hard to disentangle from her own career. But even the essays on other topics usually contain at least a gesture toward such paralysing double binds, as when, in I Thee Dread, about the wedding industry, she remembers leaving her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/nov/21/peace-corps-us-development-policy\" title=\"\">Peace Corps</a> assignment in Kyrgyzstan depleted and confused \u201cby the awful juxtaposition between my obscene power as an American and my obscene powerlessness as a woman\u201d.</p> <p>Tolentino has clearly made efforts to give her book thematic cohesion \u2013 though several of the essays recapitulate some previously published material, all were written or substantially revised in the wake of the 2016 election \u2013 but if the focus on Web 2.0, pop feminism and other familiar outcroppings of late capitalism appears a little claustrophobic, there is more to be discovered here. Perhaps it\u2019s no coincidence that two of the strongest essays, the most sinuous and expansive, examine turf she has known intimately and returned to after an absence, as opposed to waters she still swims in. Ecstasy, which connects the wilder shores of religious feeling with those of recreational drug use, is mostly set in Houston, Texas, entwining an account of the evangelical megachurch Tolentino grew up in, nicknamed the Repentagon, with a history of the local hip-hop scene that produced the technique known as \u201cchopped and screwed\u201d. The essay blends its various registers and concerns with a rare combination of flamboyance and restraint. While its ostensible subject is inward experience (the longing for transcendence; how the author lost her religious faith), much else is elegantly conveyed. Tolentino observes, for instance, that Houston has \u201cno zoning laws, which means that strip clubs sit next to churches, gleaming skyscrapers next to gap-toothed convenience stores. The freeways are, in effect, the only truly public space in the city\u201d. This observation returns later, transformed and enriched, in her evocation of the influential music of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/nov/11/dj-screw-drake-fever-ray\" title=\"\">DJ Screw</a>, who died in 2000, at 29: \u201cThe sound that mimicked the flow of all these substances, darkening the wide, anonymous, looping highways, a secret and sublime desecration that seeped through the heart and veins of a city, that set the pace and the rhythm of its people slipping past one another in their cars.\u201d</p> <p>The other essay that cuts deepest \u2013 less lyrical but more trenchant \u2013 is We Come from Old Virginia, which looks at the UVA in Charlottesville, where Tolentino went to college. Revisiting the media scandal around a poorly reported 2014 Rolling Stone feature about an accusation of gang rape at a fraternity party, she cracks open the university\u2019s fiercely guarded image: Charlottesville, she writes, \u201csells itself \u2026 as a sort of honeyed Eden, a college town with Dixie ease and gracefulness but liberal intellectual ideals\u201d. Like other pieces here, this one enacts what it describes, allowing the reader to accompany Tolentino as she works to reduce her own blind spots, as well as the denial and bad faith reinforced by both individuals and institutions, and uncover a fuller picture of UVA\u2019s history, from its 1819 founding by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/17/thomas-jefferson-revolutionary-bible-reissued\" title=\"\">Thomas Jefferson</a>, still \u201ccreepily\u201d and insistently adored on campus. She emphasises \u201ca fact that had not surfaced either in Rolling Stone or in the exhaustive coverage that followed it: UVA\u2019s first reported sexual assault occurred in 1850, when three students took an enslaved girl into a field and gang-raped her\u201d. Since \u201cviolence against women is fundamentally connected to other systems of violence\u201d, she writes, \u201cit\u2019s not possible to capture the reality of rape \u2013 or even of fraternities \u2013 at UVA without writing about race.\u201d</p> <p>Not every essay quite earns its keep alongside these more ambitious efforts. The Cult of the Difficult Woman showcases her sharpness and dedication to the tricky public service of correcting absurdities in online and media discourse, but might not need to be immortalised. Likewise, by the time I reached I Thee Dread, its extended skewering of wedding culture and its contradictions felt too similar to her explorations earlier in the book of what women are encouraged to do to themselves, such as Always Be Optimizing, in which she recalls opening her eyes on a yoga mat to \u201ccatch the twinkle of enormous diamond rings caught in shafts of sunbeam, blinking at me in the temporary darkness like a fleet of indoor stars\u201d, or mistaking another woman\u2019s pelvis for her own in the mirror of a barre class as they all \u201clay on our backs and thrust our hips into the darkness with a sacrificial devotion that I had not applied to actual sex for years\u201d. (The horrifying Mommie Dearest backstory of the barre method, begun by former ballerina <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/nov/08/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\" title=\"\">Lotte Berk</a> and continued by her daughter Esther, is worth the price of admission on its own.)</p> <p>Most striking are the moments that fully transcend the logic of a think-piece, the embodied metaphors that break beyond explicit argument. In a brief scene in her amiable memoir of her teenage summer on a forgotten reality TV show called <em>Girls v Boys: Puerto Rico</em>, the contestants, off-camera for a night, go swimming in a bioluminescent bay, one of five in the world, whose microscopic creatures sparkle when intruders move through them \u2013 swimmers were banned soon after to protect the creatures, too thoroughly intruded on, from going permanently dark. The kids are \u201cglowing like jellyfish, glittering like the \u2018Toxic\u2019 video\u201d, until, climbing back on the boat, Tolentino \u201csqueezed glittering water out of my hair.

So much is compressed in this one page: the sense of compromised, private, temporary magic; of a cultural and a natural world in a precarious state, at that time when reality TV was an eerie, impermanent experiment whose ethos hadn\u2019t yet eaten up much of social and political life; the fear that there may be no outside any more \u2013 except that there is, just about, and you fleetingly glimpse it, right before it\u2019s gone.</p> <p>\u2022<em> Trick Mirror: Reflections on Self-Delusion</em> is published by 4th Estate (\u00a314.99).

      "bodyText": "News Corp\u2019s Andrew Bolt showed \u201cabsolute ignorance\u201d when he mocked the teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg in a column for the Herald Sun, an autism awareness advocate says. The high-profile columnist for Rupert Murdoch\u2019s newspapers and Sky News commentator attacked the 16-year-old campaigner as \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d, \u201cfreakishly influential\u201d and \u201cstrange\u201d in the piece published on Wednesday. Thunberg responded on Thursday, turning Bolt\u2019s words back on him to say she was \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d by the \u201chate and conspiracy campaigns\u201d run by climate science deniers. But the column has provoked outrage among advocates for people with autism, while an expert says the News Corp writer has sent a \u201cdangerous\u201d message. \u201cIt just shows absolute ignorance on this and it\u2019s particularly cruel,\u201d said Nicole Rogerson, the chief executive of Autism Awareness Australia. \u201cAnd it also leads to misunderstanding in the wider community and his audience about what autism is.\u201d Rogerson said she was \u201cabsolutely disgusted\u201d by the attack on the 16-year-old, which she said sought to \u201cequate her autism to having a range of mental disorders\u201d. \u201cI\u2019d ask Mr Bolt does he think that nobody, no individual with autism can make a contribution to wider public discussion,\u201d she said. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Daniel Skorich, an autism researcher at the University of Queensland, said Bolt\u2019s description of autism was incorrect and was \u201cdangerous in the message it sends about autistic people\u201d. \u201cIn contrast to Andrew Bolt\u2019s derisory claims, what autism is not is a \u2018disorder which intensify fears\u2019, \u2018a fault, and a dangerous one\u2019, that makes autistic people \u2018deeply disturbed\u2019 and \u2018irrational\u2019, nor one that gives them \u2018all that certainty that unreason can possibly give,\u2019\u201d Skorich said. The condition was \u201ccharacterised by difficulties in social interaction and communication\u201d, he said. But it also leads to \u201crelative strengths in many areas, particularly in the arts, and in the natural sciences, where autistic people are over-represented relative to neurotypicals\u201d, Skorich said. A Press Council spokeswoman said: \u201cThe Press Council can confirm that it has received a complaint about Andrew Bolt\u2019s Herald-Sun column about Greta Thunberg.\u201d In the column, Bolt criticised Thunberg\u2019s decision to sail across the Atlantic in a high-speed racing yacht to attend UN climate summits in the US and Chile. \u201cI have never seen a girl so young and with so many mental disorders treated by so many adults as a guru,\u201d he wrote.

But the vast majority of it is either not recycled, unrecyclable, or doesn't get reused once it's been recycled. Volumes ending up in the natural environment are surging. Plastic can take as much as 500 years to decompose.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the implications?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Plastic is ubiquitous \u2013 and often deadly. It kills sea creatures that eat it but cannot digest it. It gets into the human food chain by contaminating the fish that we eat. It is even in our tap water. There is no science about the long-term impact of humans ingesting plastic.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is to be done?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Taxing plastic bags \u2013 or even banning them outright as Kenya has done \u2013 has changed consumer and producer behaviour. But what next? Deposit return schemes for plastic bottles work well in several countries. Charging for one-time coffee cups also seems to be on the agenda. But the real solutions may not be top down but ...<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>... bottom up?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Yes. Grassroots movements led the way on plastic bags, and have spawned others such as Refill, which emphasises reusing bottles, and A Plastic Planet, which urges plastic-free aisles in supermarkets. Popular culture remains hugely important: it's just possible that the British series The Blue Planet has changed attitudes overnight.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Speaking ahead of the judgment, the national chairperson for the Wildlife and Environmental Society of Malawi, Dr Tiwonge Mzumara-Gawa, said Malawi needed the ban \u201cbecause it\u2019s the only way that we can effectively reduce the numbers of plastic wastes getting into our most precious lakes\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/09/plastic-bags-single-use-waste-everywhere-how\">issue of micro</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/09/plastic-bags-single-use-waste-everywhere-how\">plastics getting into fish</a> is a food security, livelihood and heath concern.

Delivering the verdict on Thursday, a panel of seven judges dismissed the appeal. Companies who violate the ban face fines and the closure of their factories.

Encouraging the staff to put the TVs on, the umbrellas out and clear the tables quicker.</p> <p>But now she does it from exile, peering at her laptop and a video stream from cameras dotted between the ice hockey memorabilia lining the bar close to downtown Kansas City.</p> <p>\u201cI still have the income from the bar. I\u2019m not trying to live on 200 pesos ($10) a day. But it\u2019s still a nightmare,\u201d Stegall said by video call from the Mexican port city of Veracruz, where she currently lives after being deported and leaving her popular city bar \u2013 and her family \u2013 behind in America.</p> <p>Stegall had long feared the moment that arrived one morning in March 2018 when her car was surrounded by agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) as she pulled out of her driveway. She told herself they wouldn\u2019t deport a woman with a teenage daughter who is a US citizen, and who jointly owned a business with her American husband that created jobs and paid hefty taxes to the US Treasury.</p> <p>Stegall, 42, was still making the same arguments as she was pushed across a bridge back to Mexico four days later.</p> <p>More than a year on, she\u2019s fighting to get back to the US and grappling with anger at what she sees as the futility of ripping apart a family to make a political point.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re not deporting the cartels, the criminals, because they can\u2019t find them. They\u2019re deporting the wrong people because we\u2019re in the system. They know where to find us, the easy targets,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Sitting at a table at the Blue Line, her daughter, Jennifer, and husband, Steve, accept that Letty, as she\u2019s known in the family, had been in the country illegally for nearly two decades after paying a smuggler to bring her across the border.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c927c751fce6c9fab43924c09fe19aab4cf12c03\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c927c751fce6c9fab43924c09fe19aab4cf12c03/0_481_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leticia Stegall\u2019s husband, Steve, and daughter, Jennifer.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leticia Stegall\u2019s husband, Steve, and daughter, Jennifer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Leticia Stegall</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But they said she built a life, and her family needs her.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s running this bar.

We\u2019ve got a family together,\u201d said Steve. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point?\u201d</p> <p>Stegall managed to evade detection by immigration authorities until she was arrested for drinking and driving in 2012 and sentenced to three days in jail. The jail spotted she did not have residency papers and reported her. </p> <p>The order for her removal came in December 2016. Jennifer, who was 14-years-old, wrote a letter to the immigration court explaining why a teenage girl needs her mother.</p> <p>\u201cObviously I need my mom to be here with me. For my mental health, and to pay for things. I wrote everything she\u2019s done for me,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The immigration judge ruled deportation did not mean the family had to be split up because Stegall could take Jennifer to Mexico, a country she has never lived in. Stegall appealed and lost.</p> <p>She turned to the federal courts but that process was still making its way through the machine when Ice arrived.</p> <p>Stegall was held in the county jail. Four days later, her lawyer obtained a writ from a federal judge requiring she be brought to court. By then she was shackled and on a plane stuffed with deportees. </p> <p>\u201cTo fly me with chains around my waist and ankles as though I was a criminal was awful,\u201d she said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Obama did things that started this crackdown on immigrants.

      "bodyText": "Leticia Stegall still runs the Blue Line bar. Drawing up the rotas. Ordering barrels of beer. Encouraging the staff to put the TVs on, the umbrellas out and clear the tables quicker. But now she does it from exile, peering at her laptop and a video stream from cameras dotted between the ice hockey memorabilia lining the bar close to downtown Kansas City. \u201cI still have the income from the bar. I\u2019m not trying to live on 200 pesos ($10) a day. But it\u2019s still a nightmare,\u201d Stegall said by video call from the Mexican port city of Veracruz, where she currently lives after being deported and leaving her popular city bar \u2013 and her family \u2013 behind in America. Stegall had long feared the moment that arrived one morning in March 2018 when her car was surrounded by agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) as she pulled out of her driveway. She told herself they wouldn\u2019t deport a woman with a teenage daughter who is a US citizen, and who jointly owned a business with her American husband that created jobs and paid hefty taxes to the US Treasury. Stegall, 42, was still making the same arguments as she was pushed across a bridge back to Mexico four days later. More than a year on, she\u2019s fighting to get back to the US and grappling with anger at what she sees as the futility of ripping apart a family to make a political point. \u201cThey\u2019re not deporting the cartels, the criminals, because they can\u2019t find them. They\u2019re deporting the wrong people because we\u2019re in the system. They know where to find us, the easy targets,\u201d she said. Sitting at a table at the Blue Line, her daughter, Jennifer, and husband, Steve, accept that Letty, as she\u2019s known in the family, had been in the country illegally for nearly two decades after paying a smuggler to bring her across the border. But they said she built a life, and her family needs her. \u201cShe\u2019s running this bar. We\u2019ve got a house together. We\u2019ve got a family together,\u201d said Steve. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point?\u201d Stegall managed to evade detection by immigration authorities until she was arrested for drinking and driving in 2012 and sentenced to three days in jail. The jail spotted she did not have residency papers and reported her. The order for her removal came in December 2016. Jennifer, who was 14-years-old, wrote a letter to the immigration court explaining why a teenage girl needs her mother. \u201cObviously I need my mom to be here with me. For my mental health, and to pay for things. I wrote everything she\u2019s done for me,\u201d she said. The immigration judge ruled deportation did not mean the family had to be split up because Stegall could take Jennifer to Mexico, a country she has never lived in. Stegall appealed and lost. She turned to the federal courts but that process was still making its way through the machine when Ice arrived. Stegall was held in the county jail. Four days later, her lawyer obtained a writ from a federal judge requiring she be brought to court. By then she was shackled and on a plane stuffed with deportees. \u201cTo fly me with chains around my waist and ankles as though I was a criminal was awful,\u201d she said. Stegall and her family insist that Ice was aware of the court order and defied it. The immigration service said it only received it after she left the country. By evening Stegall was standing at the frontier in Brownsville, Texas. \u201cThey dropped me off on the border and said, \u2018Now you can go\u2019. I said, \u2018Where? I don\u2019t know anybody here on the border\u2019. The guy was, \u2018If you knew how to cross the border to get here 20 years ago, you should know your way back\u2019,\u201d she said. Stegall made her way to Veracruz where her parents live. \u201cI didn\u2019t have time to say goodbye to my daughter. She went to school and I was gone. I can\u2019t imagine how she felt when they tell her mom is not coming home,\u201d she said. \u201cI started getting sick, losing my hair like crazy. I had bald patches everywhere. I missed my daughter\u2019s graduation and signing for college.\u201d The separation has taken its toll on Jennifer too. \u201cI\u2019ve always had good grades and they were so bad. I told my mom. She was mad,\u201d she said. Jennifer eventually graduated from high school and begins studying to be a nurse next month. She visits her mother during the holidays but struggles with her absence. Stegall is aware that much of the legal process to remove her from the country took place when Barack Obama was president. \u201cObama did things that started this crackdown on immigrants. Yes, it\u2019s true. But something changed. They say Obama built the cages but he wasn\u2019t attacking people the way Trump is doing it,\u201d she said. So how does she respond to a president who says, correctly, that she came to the country illegally? \u201cWho\u2019s going to cut the tomatoes? Not his family. And isn\u2019t his wife an immigrant? Aren\u2019t her parents immigrants? Who\u2019s going to do the roofing? Who\u2019s going to wash dishes in the restaurants? This country was built up by immigrants,\u201d she said.

      "body": "<p>For Americans who would resist President Trump\u2019s re-election in 2020, the outcome hinges on the answer to this basic strategic question: will the Democrats risk losing to Trump by nominating a candidate whose ideas are too far to the left to appeal to the moderate majority of Americans? Or will Democrats risk losing to Trump by nominating a candidate whose ideas are insufficiently progressive to excite the Democratic base?</p> <p>This basic question of moderation v progressivism was at the heart of the first of two Democratic debates in Detroit and doubtless will continue to be central throughout the rest of the primary process. By taking one side or another, Democratic voters will be making a choice not only for the candidate and the policies he or she will stand for, but also for how the campaign will be conducted and the underlying rationale for how political change can be accomplished.</p> <p>The moderate/progressive split was on clear display in Tuesday\u2019s debate. Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts upheld the progressive side, while moderates were represented by Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio, the former representative John Delaney of Maryland, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Governor Steve Bullock of Montana and the former governor John Hickenlooper of Colorado. The former representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana to some extent tried to straddle both wings, while the spiritual guru Marianne Williamson occupied her own dimension but generally adhered to the progressive side.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/31/democrats-debate-panelists-verdict\">Who won the Democrats' debate? Our panelists' verdict</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The debate was stacked against the moderates in the sense that Sanders and Warren are leading contenders for the nomination, polling around 15% in <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/2020_democratic_presidential_nomination-6730.html\">most polls</a>, while the moderates struggle to reach 1%. Both Sanders and Warren had considerably more <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/07/30/us/elections/debate-speaking-time.html\">speaking time</a> than any of their opponents, and the comparative insignificance of the moderates (in terms of polling, at any rate) meant that Sanders and Warren didn\u2019t really have to engage deeply with their criticisms.</p> <p>Nonetheless, the outline of the moderate/progressive split became clear over the course of the debate. The progressives believe that Democrats must dramatically restructure government, politics and the economy \u2013 what Warren <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/07/31/transcript-first-night-second-democratic-debate/?utm_term=.aa93c46e0b97\">referred to in the debate</a> as \u201ca corrupt, rigged system\u201d that operates mainly in the interests of \u201cthe wealthy and well-connected\u201d \u2013 in order to foster a more equitable society.</p> <p>Sanders is an avowed socialist while Warren <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/capitalist-elizabeth-warren-has-the-right-antidote-to-socialism-and-trumpism-2018-7\">calls herself</a> a \u201ccapitalist to my bones\u201d, but both see large corporations and billionaires as malign forces driving corruption in Washington and inequality in society as a whole. Neither is calling for a government takeover of the means of production, but Sanders in the debate characterized the fossil fuel industry as \u201ca criminal activity\u201d and rejected the idea of healthcare as a business, while the Medicare for All plan that Sanders and Warren endorse would in effect nationalize the health insurance industry.</p> <p>Both Sanders and Warren support decriminalizing the border and providing government health insurance to undocumented migrants. Both advocate large-scale government intervention to make public higher education free and forgive student loan debt. They support the Green New Deal, which calls for eliminating carbon emissions by 2030 as well as providing a federal jobs guarantee. They would pay for these plans in large part by imposing a tax on the wealthiest Americans.</p> <p>The moderates in the debate did not refer to themselves as moderates or centrists, but rather presented themselves as pragmatic progressives. Some of the ideas they put forward would have been considered fairly radical in the recent past, including a public option for healthcare (giving people under age 65 the choice of buying into Medicare), direct government negotiation to lower prescription drug prices, universal pre-K education, and a plan to tax carbon emissions and return the revenues as a \u201cdividend\u201d to all households.</p> <p>Unlike the progressives, however, the moderates took pains to emphasize that their programs were bold but \u201crealistic\u201d, meaning that they would be popular with the public as well as financially and legislatively feasible \u2013 as opposed to what Bullock characterized as \u201cwishlist economics\u201d and Delaney called \u201cfree everything\u201d.</p> <p>Delaney rejected Warren\u2019s wealth tax as unworkable and probably unconstitutional, though he agreed that \u201cwealthy Americans have to pay more\u201d and called for raising the capital gains tax. Klobuchar criticized the idea of free college as a giveaway to wealthy Americans. The moderates rejected Medicare for All on the grounds that it would take away the private insurance that many Americans (including union members) value \u2013 and Hickenlooper added that none of the Democrats who won back control of the House by flipping Republican seats in the 2018 elections had supported the plan. As Delaney put it, \u201cDemocrats win when we run on real solutions, not impossible promises; when we run on things that are workable, not fairytale economics.\u201d</p> <p>To the progressives, that sounded like what Warren called \u201csmall ideas and spinelessness\u201d \u2013 a cowardly avoidance of necessary structural change. Warren also scored one of the night\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/30/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-debate.html\">most memorable lines</a> by wondering aloud \u201cwhy anybody goes to all the trouble of running for president of the United States just to talk about what we really can\u2019t do and shouldn\u2019t fight for\u201d.</p> <p>That was a low blow, given that Delaney and the other moderates do in fact advocate ambitious policies. They\u2019re not standing for inaction, and their moderation is not mere incrementalism or acceptance of the status quo.</p> <p>But the moderates, by and large, are concerned not only with practicality but also with restoring the sense of national unity shredded by Trump, while the progressives call for fighting fire with fire. While neither moderate nor progressive candidates have a clearly articulated view of how their proposals will become reality, moderates pay at least some heed to the possibilities for bipartisanship \u2013 not a word that Sanders or Warren uttered at the debate \u2013 and assembling broad coalitions of support.</p> <p>Moderates, for example, want government to collaborate with business on projects such as rebuilding the nation\u2019s infrastructure. They also see healthcare companies as part of an overall solution to the problems in that field; Delaney at one point charged that the progressives\u2019 Medicare for All plan revealed \u201can anti-private sector strategy\u201d.</p> <p>Progressives, on the other hand, believe corporations are such self-serving, parasitic and unpatriotic entities that they have to be opposed at all turns, not just in the health and energy fields but almost across the board. Warren boasted: \u201cI took on Wall Street, and CEOs, and their lobbyists, and their lawyers, and I beat them.\u201d Sanders took pride in having voted against all trade agreements on the grounds that \u201cif anybody here thinks that corporate America gives one damn about the average American worker, you\u2019re mistaken.

In this week\u2019s debates, Bullock hailed Obamacare as a legislative accomplishment decades in the making and worth building upon, while Delaney protested that Warren\u2019s critique of TPP ignored that it did include strong environmental and labor standards.

      "bodyText": "For Americans who would resist President Trump\u2019s re-election in 2020, the outcome hinges on the answer to this basic strategic question: will the Democrats risk losing to Trump by nominating a candidate whose ideas are too far to the left to appeal to the moderate majority of Americans? Or will Democrats risk losing to Trump by nominating a candidate whose ideas are insufficiently progressive to excite the Democratic base? This basic question of moderation v progressivism was at the heart of the first of two Democratic debates in Detroit and doubtless will continue to be central throughout the rest of the primary process. By taking one side or another, Democratic voters will be making a choice not only for the candidate and the policies he or she will stand for, but also for how the campaign will be conducted and the underlying rationale for how political change can be accomplished. The moderate/progressive split was on clear display in Tuesday\u2019s debate. Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts upheld the progressive side, while moderates were represented by Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio, the former representative John Delaney of Maryland, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Governor Steve Bullock of Montana and the former governor John Hickenlooper of Colorado. The former representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana to some extent tried to straddle both wings, while the spiritual guru Marianne Williamson occupied her own dimension but generally adhered to the progressive side. The debate was stacked against the moderates in the sense that Sanders and Warren are leading contenders for the nomination, polling around 15% in most polls, while the moderates struggle to reach 1%. Both Sanders and Warren had considerably more speaking time than any of their opponents, and the comparative insignificance of the moderates (in terms of polling, at any rate) meant that Sanders and Warren didn\u2019t really have to engage deeply with their criticisms. Nonetheless, the outline of the moderate/progressive split became clear over the course of the debate. The progressives believe that Democrats must dramatically restructure government, politics and the economy \u2013 what Warren referred to in the debate as \u201ca corrupt, rigged system\u201d that operates mainly in the interests of \u201cthe wealthy and well-connected\u201d \u2013 in order to foster a more equitable society. Sanders is an avowed socialist while Warren calls herself a \u201ccapitalist to my bones\u201d, but both see large corporations and billionaires as malign forces driving corruption in Washington and inequality in society as a whole. Neither is calling for a government takeover of the means of production, but Sanders in the debate characterized the fossil fuel industry as \u201ca criminal activity\u201d and rejected the idea of healthcare as a business, while the Medicare for All plan that Sanders and Warren endorse would in effect nationalize the health insurance industry. Both Sanders and Warren support decriminalizing the border and providing government health insurance to undocumented migrants. Both advocate large-scale government intervention to make public higher education free and forgive student loan debt. They support the Green New Deal, which calls for eliminating carbon emissions by 2030 as well as providing a federal jobs guarantee. They would pay for these plans in large part by imposing a tax on the wealthiest Americans. The moderates in the debate did not refer to themselves as moderates or centrists, but rather presented themselves as pragmatic progressives. Some of the ideas they put forward would have been considered fairly radical in the recent past, including a public option for healthcare (giving people under age 65 the choice of buying into Medicare), direct government negotiation to lower prescription drug prices, universal pre-K education, and a plan to tax carbon emissions and return the revenues as a \u201cdividend\u201d to all households. Unlike the progressives, however, the moderates took pains to emphasize that their programs were bold but \u201crealistic\u201d, meaning that they would be popular with the public as well as financially and legislatively feasible \u2013 as opposed to what Bullock characterized as \u201cwishlist economics\u201d and Delaney called \u201cfree everything\u201d. Delaney rejected Warren\u2019s wealth tax as unworkable and probably unconstitutional, though he agreed that \u201cwealthy Americans have to pay more\u201d and called for raising the capital gains tax. Klobuchar criticized the idea of free college as a giveaway to wealthy Americans. The moderates rejected Medicare for All on the grounds that it would take away the private insurance that many Americans (including union members) value \u2013 and Hickenlooper added that none of the Democrats who won back control of the House by flipping Republican seats in the 2018 elections had supported the plan. As Delaney put it, \u201cDemocrats win when we run on real solutions, not impossible promises; when we run on things that are workable, not fairytale economics.\u201d To the progressives, that sounded like what Warren called \u201csmall ideas and spinelessness\u201d \u2013 a cowardly avoidance of necessary structural change. Warren also scored one of the night\u2019s most memorable lines by wondering aloud \u201cwhy anybody goes to all the trouble of running for president of the United States just to talk about what we really can\u2019t do and shouldn\u2019t fight for\u201d. That was a low blow, given that Delaney and the other moderates do in fact advocate ambitious policies. They\u2019re not standing for inaction, and their moderation is not mere incrementalism or acceptance of the status quo. But the moderates, by and large, are concerned not only with practicality but also with restoring the sense of national unity shredded by Trump, while the progressives call for fighting fire with fire. While neither moderate nor progressive candidates have a clearly articulated view of how their proposals will become reality, moderates pay at least some heed to the possibilities for bipartisanship \u2013 not a word that Sanders or Warren uttered at the debate \u2013 and assembling broad coalitions of support. Moderates, for example, want government to collaborate with business on projects such as rebuilding the nation\u2019s infrastructure. They also see healthcare companies as part of an overall solution to the problems in that field; Delaney at one point charged that the progressives\u2019 Medicare for All plan revealed \u201can anti-private sector strategy\u201d. Progressives, on the other hand, believe corporations are such self-serving, parasitic and unpatriotic entities that they have to be opposed at all turns, not just in the health and energy fields but almost across the board. Warren boasted: \u201cI took on Wall Street, and CEOs, and their lobbyists, and their lawyers, and I beat them.\u201d Sanders took pride in having voted against all trade agreements on the grounds that \u201cif anybody here thinks that corporate America gives one damn about the average American worker, you\u2019re mistaken. If they can save five cents by going to China, Mexico, or Vietnam, or anyplace else, that\u2019s exactly what they will do.\u201d Trade agreements such as Nafta and the Trans-Pacific Partnership were, of course, negotiated during the administrations of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, and part of what divides Democrats is the question of whether the achievements of those comparatively moderate presidencies are worth defending. In this week\u2019s debates, Bullock hailed Obamacare as a legislative accomplishment decades in the making and worth building upon, while Delaney protested that Warren\u2019s critique of TPP ignored that it did include strong environmental and labor standards. But Warren\u2019s charge that \u201cfor decades, we have had a government that has been on the side of the rich and the powerful\u201d certainly included the Clinton and Obama presidencies in her indictment. Moderates also warn that many of the progressives\u2019 ideas may appeal to Democratic activists but are unpopular with the general public. For example, roughly six in 10 Democrats favor giving health insurance to undocumented migrants, but overall, Americans oppose such a policy by a 59% to 38% margin. A Kaiser Family Foundation poll from earlier this year found that a majority of those surveyed approved the idea of Medicare for All, but support dropped precipitously when respondents were told that this would require eliminating private health insurance. Ryan, in pointing out the general unpopularity of those positions as well as the notion of decriminalizing the border, warned: \u201cI quite frankly don\u2019t think that that is an agenda that we can move forward on and win.\u201d Policy choices, for both moderates and progressives, relate to their overall electoral strategies. Moderates want to appeal to the suburban, college-educated voters who gave the Democrats the House majority in 2018, as well as to independent voters and disaffected Republicans.

Bullock, in Tuesday\u2019s debate, insisted that \u201cwe do have to win back some of those places we lost\u201d in 2016, \u201cand get those Trump voters back if we are going to win\u201d.

The woman is a mirage, a trick \u2013 which may be the saddest element of Hitchcock\u2019s perverse vision of impossible, fooled love.

This long, dark odyssey of fearful soul-searching, broached taboos and midlife malaise forms the basis of Kubrick\u2019s last trance.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/04/stanley-kubrick-best-films-ranked\">Stanley Kubrick's best films \u2013 ranked!</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>As Good as It Gets</strong></h2> <p><em><strong>By James L Brooks (US, 1997) \u2013 out 1 August</strong></em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrRl2QQKkI8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rrRl2QQKkI8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Simpsons visionary James L Brooks\u2019s comedy is worth revisiting just to see what has changed in big-budget cinema since representation and diversity became Hollywood\u2019s mandates.

      "bodyText": "Netflix The Thing By John Carpenter (US, 1982) \u2013 out now Lunar Antarctica is a disturbingly claustrophobic location for Carpenter\u2019s sci-fi-flecked horror. As a crushing blizzard approaches, a research station is terrorised by an invading creature that imperfectly imitates its prey. Any of the 12 scientists could be infected \u2013 including a 30-year-old Kurt Russel as the alcoholic, reluctant leader of the increasingly paranoid pack. Crafted long before digital effects began to drive filmmaking, The Thing\u2019s shapeshifting alien is a wondrous, howling, Francis Bacon-like creation, whose gnawing, twisted, clawing entrails energise every moment. A Star is Born By Bradley Cooper (US, 2018) \u2013 out 3 August The new telling of this self-mythologising Hollywood tale may not surpass the terrible melancholy of the 1952 musical starring Judy Garland and James Mason, but it brings a new shine to the persona of fame-hungry Lady Gaga as Ally: a downtrodden musician whose star is rising and surpassing that of her tragic lover, Jackson Maine (Bradley Cooper, whose performance cedes the spotlight to Gaga). Make what you will of Cooper\u2019s directorial debut: a cheesy, overinflated romance of doomed love; the latest effort to revive the Hollywood epics of the past; a glossy vision of emasculation and addiction. Vertigo By Alfred Hitchcock (US, 1958) \u2013 out 16 August Scotty (once a police officer, now a private eye) searches for a cure for his impossible sexual desire of a woman, Madeleine (Kim Novak), whom he could not save and cannot let vanish into memory. To borrow the title of the French novel on which Vertigo is based, he lives among the dead. The woman is a mirage, a trick \u2013 which may be the saddest element of Hitchcock\u2019s perverse vision of impossible, fooled love. An obsessive male law-enforcer cursed by the fetishistic forces of delusion? A story of buried mental illness? A noirish thriller of oppressed, controlled women longing to break free? Every viewing of Hitchcock\u2019s classic mystery serves a new interpretation. Honourable mentions: Up in the Air (film, 1 August), The Untouchables (film, 15 August), Dazed and Confused (film, 16 August). Stan The Insult By Ziad Doueiri (Lebanon, 2018) \u2013 out 3 August Much like the films of Iranian master Asghar Farhadi, a minor domestic incident triggers a broader examination of a society in crisis. In this case, it\u2019s a spate between a Christian mechanic and a Muslim Palestinian builder over a broken drain pipe in a house (in a Christian neighbourhood in Beirut) which ends in a vicious courtroom feud \u2013 and allows director Doueiri to look candidly and unblinkingly at sectarian tensions in Lebanon. The film rockets forth like an angry fable, with both sides given an empathetic airing as the microcosm of personal drama gives way to a longer view of historical unease. Mad Max: Fury Road By George Miller (Australia, 2015) \u2013 out 10 August Should we believe George Miller\u2019s recent hints of two further Mad Max films \u2013 the least cynical, most legitimate big franchise of the minute? This fourth instalment of the decades-long apocalyptic freak-out merges art and action scenes for real purpose. Fury Road\u2019s grisly rollicking journey from parched desert to eco-utopia seriously considers environmental destruction and what new, strange societies might emerge from it. British actor Tom Hardy takes over the central role as a hero years after the collapse of society, but it\u2019s the film\u2019s view of women\u2019s solidarity \u2013 Charlize Theron as the true warrior leading five despots\u2019 wives on the run from a mad warlord \u2013 that really rages. The Loudest Voice By Tom McCarthy, Alex Metcalf (US, 2019) \u2013 concludes 11 August Some of the year\u2019s strongest hours of television have occurred in this miniseries, based on Gabriel Sherman\u2019s book on the rise and fall of Fox News founder Roger Ailes (Russell Crowe): the disgraced rightwing media mogul. Early episodes reveal Ailes\u2019s role in the era that preceded (and paved the way for) Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, the Tea party, and the polarising, warmongering post-9/11 moment. We watch as he forms a business built on negativity, paranoia and division, which offers a vehicle for political rage to two ageing, male patriarchs (Ailes and his shady, moneyed enabler, Rupert Murdoch), who are eager to see their dynasties continue in an uncertain future. Frances Ha By Noah Baumbach and Greta Gerwig (US, 2012) \u2013 out 29 August \u201cI\u2019m so embarrassed, I\u2019m not a real person yet!\u201d So proceeds Noah Baumbach and Greta Gerwig\u2019s anti-manifesto of growing up, tripping over and living imperfectly. Before her brilliant solo directorial debut Lady Bird, actor and co-writer Gerwig shone in this comedic drama that, for all its whimsy, never feels slight, as it flutters around the life of its heroine Frances: a dancer trying to make something, anything, of herself in New York City. Honourable mentions: 8 \u00bd (film, out now), Antichrist (film, 22 August). Foxtel Now Eyes Wide Shut By Stanley Kubrick (US/UK, 1999) \u2013 out 1 August Stanley Kubrick\u2019s final masterwork confounded many, but at its heart it\u2019s about a marriage in crisis. Wealthy, complacent Dr Bill Hartford (Tom Cruise, opaque as ever in his emotional confusion) is thrown into a male vortex of jealousy when his wife Alice (Nicole Kidman) confesses to fantasising about another man. Bill walks away from the comfort of what he knows and towards a sexual adventure of his own, involving a mysterious, elite cabal in the countryside. This long, dark odyssey of fearful soul-searching, broached taboos and midlife malaise forms the basis of Kubrick\u2019s last trance. As Good as It Gets By James L Brooks (US, 1997) \u2013 out 1 August Simpsons visionary James L Brooks\u2019s comedy is worth revisiting just to see what has changed in big-budget cinema since representation and diversity became Hollywood\u2019s mandates. The plot feels anachronistic: a wretched, bigoted, old eccentric (Jack Nicholson) falls in love with a beleaguered waitress (Helen Hunt), befriends his gay neighbour (Greg Kinnear) and becomes a better man \u2013 all the while staying true to his curmudgeonly ways. And yet the immaculately scripted film creates a small, lovely world of idiosyncratic characters, moments of cartoony irreverence, and that warm, wonderful feeling of the once-great romcom genre. Honourable Mentions: Sleepless in Seattle, Jackie Brown, 21 Jump St, The Descendants, Tootsie (films, 1 August), Succession season 2 (weekly from 12 August), Divorce season 3 (out now), Gurrumul (film, 15 August). SBS On Demand Robbie Hood By Dylan River (Australia, 2019) \u2013 out now A small but significant series of six ten-minute episodes from Dylan Rivers: a deeply visual storyteller who is the son of Australian director Warwick Thornton. Rivers takes the British tale of Robin Hood into the world of a motherless adolescent, Robbie (Pedrea Jackson), who is facing the hurt of racial discrimination in Alice Springs.

Ada\u2019s piano is her key means of communication, and Campion\u2019s tale is rich in mood and metaphor \u2013 a poetic, colonial Gothic about an unwelcome society perched at the world\u2019s edge. Killing of a Sacred Deer By Yorgos Lanthimos (Ireland/UK, 2017) \u2013 out 14 August Greek auteur Yorgos Lanthimos continues his enjoyably misanthropic mission into English-language art cinema with this Freudian tale of emasculation. A doughy, weak-minded heart surgeon, Steven (Colin Farrell) is used to playing God until a much younger man, Martin (Barry Keoghin), curses the doctor for being unable to save his own father.

ABC iView Community: season two By various (US, 2010) \u2013 every weeknight A breezy sitcom with the occasional spark of madness, Community was inspired by creator Dan Harmon\u2019s own experiences at community college \u2013 and its second season was made in the period before Harmon\u2019s departure (and subsequent return) to the show. In the pleasingly banal storylines (Annie loses a pen!), you can still feel the series\u2019 affectionate energy, and the golden embrace of the entire cast: uber-sarcastic Jeff (Joel McHale), preppy Annie (Allison Brie), perennially scapegoated and earnest Britta (Gillian Jacobs), dopey Troy (Donald Glover) and professional asshole Pierce (Chevy Chase).

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s surprise decision to escalate the trade war with tariffs on another $300bn of Chinese goods has sent global financial markets into a tailspin. After sharp falls on Wall Street in the wake of the US president\u2019s announcement on Twitter on Thursday, Asian share prices plummeted on Friday morning as growing hopes that the world\u2019s two economic superpowers would be able to reach a deal were dashed. In Tokyo the Nikkei was down 2.3%, with a similar fall in Hong Kong and Shanghai. The Kospi was down 0.8% in Seoul while in Sydney the benchmark ASX200, which passed its pre-global financial crisis all-time high on Tuesday, fell 0.3%. On the commodities markets the price of Brent crude oil plunged 7%, its biggest fall for four years, although it recovered 2.5% on Friday to $62.01. Trump\u2019s decision was also likely to increase the chances of another cut in US interest rates with the prospect of worsening trade with China forcing the Federal Reserve to loosen monetary policy again in September. It follows Wednesday\u2019s 0.25% reduction, which was widely seen as not being enough to please the president who has been very vocal in calling for lower rates to boost the economy. As a signal of lower rates to come, the 10-year US bond yield fell almost 12 basis points on Thursday to 1.902%, hitting the lowest level since Trump won the presidential election in November 2016. The US dollar also fell and stockmarkets in Europe and the US were braced for a turbulent last day\u2019s trading of the week. The FTSE100 is set to drop 1% at the opening and the Dow 0.3%. Investors had hoped that the resumption of talks between the US and Chinese negotiating teams in Shanghai this week would pave the way for a deal. Such an outcome looked even more likely when the White House said on Thursday that China was coming into line with a key request to buy more agricultural produce such as soy beans. Less than 15 minutes later the president tweeted that China had not committed to buying more produce and had also failed to fulfil a pledge to cut sales of the opioid fentanyl with the result that \u201cmany Americans continue to die\u201d. The proposed new tariffs would cover almost all Chinese exports to the US and impact a huge range of consumer goods, pushing up prices for consumers and bringing the prospect of retail job losses. Neil Wilson, chief analyst at markets.com in London, said: \u201cThe sharp shooters have given way to the heavy artillery. The trade war just got very hot, just as we thought things were improving.\u201d Speaking in Bangkok on the sidelines of the Asean regional summit, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said on Friday that \u201cdecades of bad behaviour\u201d from China had forced Washington to introduce tariffs. However, senior Chinese diplomat Wang Yi was also in the Thai capital and said the tariff threat was \u201cnot a correct or constructive way\u201d to resolve the dispute. Wang\u2019s comments underlined the view of many observers that the threat makes a resolution less likely, partly because one of China\u2019s main criteria for a deal is that existing tariffs should be scrapped. Bill Bishop, author of the influential Sinocism newsletter, said the surprise move would instead strengthen Beijing\u2019s resolve to sit tight and wait out the Trump presidency. Despite the negative impact on Chinese exports, Trump had given president Xi Jinping more cover against internal criticism that was mishandling relations with Washington, Bishop argued. US businesses could now expect \u201can intensification of non-tariff measures that penalise American firms and executives\u201d. \u201cThe new status quo in US-China relations is that there is no status quo and we are in an increasingly unstable and unpredictable new era,\u201d he wrote on Friday morning. Likewise, China\u2019s Global Times newspaper said Beijing would focus more on efforts to survive a prolonged trade war. Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the Communist party-backed newspaper, wrote on Twitter: \u201cNew tariffs will by no means bring closer a deal that the US wants; it will only make it further away.\u201d The trade dispute between Japan and South Korea also worsened on Friday when the government in Tokyo removed its neighbour from a so-called white list of favoured export partners. The move defied warnings from Seoul that it would have \u201cgrave consequences\u201d for security ties between the US allies. Japan says the move is necessary for national security, accusing Seoul of violating export rules, but the measure comes with the countries mired in a long-running dispute over second world war forced labour in South Korea.",

It cooks its speciality, tuna from the strait of Gibraltar, in a variety of ways: from traditional with a twist to a more-modern style. Tuna tartare or tuna <em>lasa\u00f1a</em> are my favourites. The menu is long and the quality is high, though the prices remain reasonable (tapas from \u20ac2.20). Check out the wine list, too, and you\u2019ll spot some great bottles.<br>\u2022<em> \u20ac12-\u20ac14pp, Calle Columela 4, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/lataperiadecolumela/\" title=\"\">on Facebook</a></em></p> <h2>Bar el Veedor</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e9ec38bc19fdaf380ac57b60301a5f777c523d7e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9ec38bc19fdaf380ac57b60301a5f777c523d7e/635_0_3024_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Seasoned ham in bar Veedor, Cadiz\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Doubling as a corner shop and a \u201crestaurant\u201d, Bar el Veedor does standard tapas (though the service is quick) and the chips are typically Spanish (ie, soggy), but the tortilla is good and the sherries from the wooden barrels piled at one end of the bar are great. The glory of Veedor, though, is the superlative jam\u00f3n, which can be bought in vacuum-sealed packs to take away. The tapa of braised venison is a personal favourite (though it\u2019s only available when in season).<br>\u2022<em> \u20ac8-14pp, Calle Vea Murgu\u00eda, 10, no phone or website</em></p> <h2>El T\u00edo de la Tiza</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e777bfad263a701a00e1e9d208808844c595534d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e777bfad263a701a00e1e9d208808844c595534d/7_575_2970_1782/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People in terraces in Plaza Tio de la Tiza, Taberna Tio de la Tiza, at night, Cadiz, Andalusia, Spain\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This place serves some of the best seafood in C\u00e1diz, a fact that\u2019s beginning to show in how popular it is. Reservations are a must, especially in high summer \u2013 even call the day before, as the seating (all outside) is limited given the demand. This is all worth it. In season, especially in August, the<em> caballa </em>(a grilled whole bone-in mackerel) is fantastic.<br>\u2022 <em>\u20ac10-\u20ac14pp, </em><em>Plaza del T\u00edo de la Tiza, +34 956 21 20 82</em><em>, no website</em></p> <h2>Cumbres Mayores</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"17bcf60af01512007d3a3975432d46e0fecc3a36\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/17bcf60af01512007d3a3975432d46e0fecc3a36/0_22_1080_648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Crowded bar area at Mes\u00f3n Cumbres Mayores, Cadiz, Spain.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The Iberian pork here \u2013 the house speciality \u2013 is wonderful.

The down-to-earth menu is limited but it doesn\u2019t matter what you order because it\u2019s all going be great. The quality-to-price ratio is off the chart, and the (fantastic) service is borderline unheard-of in C\u00e1diz.

It calls itself a tapas bar but the size (and price) of the plates is more in keeping with a restaurant. The decor and the cuisine are modern but not pretentious. The octopus with potatoes and seaweed cream is the standout dish.

Balandro is divided into two sections: white linen-clad tables at the front and a bar area at the back. Do not be put off by the bar bit (which also has a few high stools and tables behind it) because the dishes are the same and the price is roughly half that if you were to order at one of the fancy tables. It gets busy, so while you\u2019re waiting, look for someone who is about to pay and catch their eye to take their spot.

The two women who run it take time to explain the menu, make recommendations and suggest wine. Speaking some Spanish helps, as this isn\u2019t a touristy place (though there is a menu in English). It offers traditional, local dishes with modern and international flavours.

      "bodyText": "Taper\u00eda de Columela Go early: this tapa place is very small and almost always busy. It cooks its speciality, tuna from the strait of Gibraltar, in a variety of ways: from traditional with a twist to a more-modern style. Tuna tartare or tuna lasa\u00f1a are my favourites. The menu is long and the quality is high, though the prices remain reasonable (tapas from \u20ac2.20). Check out the wine list, too, and you\u2019ll spot some great bottles. \u2022 \u20ac12-\u20ac14pp, Calle Columela 4, on Facebook Bar el Veedor Doubling as a corner shop and a \u201crestaurant\u201d, Bar el Veedor does standard tapas (though the service is quick) and the chips are typically Spanish (ie, soggy), but the tortilla is good and the sherries from the wooden barrels piled at one end of the bar are great. The glory of Veedor, though, is the superlative jam\u00f3n, which can be bought in vacuum-sealed packs to take away. The tapa of braised venison is a personal favourite (though it\u2019s only available when in season). \u2022 \u20ac8-14pp, Calle Vea Murgu\u00eda, 10, no phone or website El T\u00edo de la Tiza This place serves some of the best seafood in C\u00e1diz, a fact that\u2019s beginning to show in how popular it is. Reservations are a must, especially in high summer \u2013 even call the day before, as the seating (all outside) is limited given the demand. This is all worth it. In season, especially in August, the caballa (a grilled whole bone-in mackerel) is fantastic. \u2022 \u20ac10-\u20ac14pp, Plaza del T\u00edo de la Tiza, +34 956 21 20 82, no website Cumbres Mayores The Iberian pork here \u2013 the house speciality \u2013 is wonderful. Sit at the high tables in front of \u2013 or at \u2013 the bar. The tables and terrace are reserved for full meals, so avoid those if you want to take advantage of the ample tapas menu. Try the montadito (small sandwich) with secreto (a tender strip of pork hidden beneath a thick layer of belly fat) and jam\u00f3n, as well as and the abanico (stewed rib meat) with Pedro X\u00edmenez sauce. \u2022 \u20ac8-\u20ac12pp, Calle Zorrilla 4, mesoncumbresmayores.com Tabernita This tiny tapas place is always busy\u2026 always. Double check in advance because it only opens on certain days of the week (Thursday to Sunday evenings currently, and Saturday and Sunday lunchtimes). The down-to-earth menu is limited but it doesn\u2019t matter what you order because it\u2019s all going be great. The quality-to-price ratio is off the chart, and the (fantastic) service is borderline unheard-of in C\u00e1diz. The wines change with the season and availability and are always good. \u2022 \u20ac8-\u20ac12pp, Calle Virgen de la Palma 32, on Facebook Candela This is one of the fancier places in C\u00e1diz (and that shows in the prices), but for the quality of ingredients and attention to detail on presentation and flavours it is money well-spent. It calls itself a tapas bar but the size (and price) of the plates is more in keeping with a restaurant. The decor and the cuisine are modern but not pretentious. The octopus with potatoes and seaweed cream is the standout dish. Booking recommended. \u2022 \u20ac18-\u20ac22pp, Calle Feduchy 3, lacandelatapasbar.com Balandro Of all of the food places that I love in C\u00e1diz, this is the one with the largest variety of food on offer \u2013 but don\u2019t worry, there is no corresponding fall in quality. Balandro is divided into two sections: white linen-clad tables at the front and a bar area at the back. Do not be put off by the bar bit (which also has a few high stools and tables behind it) because the dishes are the same and the price is roughly half that if you were to order at one of the fancy tables. It gets busy, so while you\u2019re waiting, look for someone who is about to pay and catch their eye to take their spot. The pasta with Pedro X\u00edmenez wine is unforgettable. \u2022 \u20ac13-\u20ac15pp, Alameda Apodaca 22, restaurantebalandro.com Recreo Chico The food isn\u2019t flashy and the decor is pretty standard at relatively new and less well-known Recreo Chico, but the service is personalised. The two women who run it take time to explain the menu, make recommendations and suggest wine. Speaking some Spanish helps, as this isn\u2019t a touristy place (though there is a menu in English). It offers traditional, local dishes with modern and international flavours. If the salmorejo (cold tomato and bread soup/dip) is in season, it is a must. \u2022 \u20ac12-\u20ac14pp, Calle San Jos\u00e9, 21, on Facebook SanWich This burger-and-sandwich joint majors on Chilean-style food, such as the S\u00e1ndwich Barros Jarpa (grilled lac\u00f3n, mozzarella and mayonnaise, \u20ac7.50) and S\u00e1ndwich Chacarero (beefsteak, green beans, tomato, green pepper and mayonnaise, \u20ac7.90). The meat is sourced locally from free-range cattle farms, and it also offers vegetarian and vegan options for almost every item on the menu (including hot dogs, burgers and pies). \u2022 Calle Nueva, 7, sandwichcadiz.com Osare Naturally, while in Spain you should eat traditional cuisine but every now and then someone in the family may want a pizza \u2026 When that happens, the place to go is Osare, with its wood-fired oven and pizzas made to order (from \u20ac4). The menu, which also features pasta dishes (\u20ac7.50), may have you pondering for a while, though, as there are 22 pizzas to choose from. It is possible to have the pizza delivered to your hotel or take it away and eat in a plaza or overlooking the sea. \u2022 Rosario 27, pizzeriaosarecadiz.com Looking for a holiday with a difference?

It cuts the Conservatives\u2019 working majority in the Commons to just one. The Lib Dems\u2019 Jane Dodds won 13,826 votes with the Conservatives taking 12,401 \u2013 a margin of 1,425 that overturned the Tories\u2019 previous majority of more than 8,000. We are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/aug/02/brecon-and-radnorshire-byelection-result-lib-dems-no-deal-brexit-boris-johnson-majority-live\">covering all the reaction live this morning</a>.</p> \n<p>In her acceptance speech, Dodds pledged: \u201cMy very first act as your MP when I arrive in Westminster will be to find Mr Boris Johnson, wherever he\u2019s hiding, and tell him loud and clear: stop playing with the futures of our communities and rule out a no-deal Brexit.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a803a659-bd8a-4ee8-a75c-354e948b0452\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Hkyxo9dinOY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cPeople are desperately crying out for a different kind of politics. There is no time for tribalism when our country is faced with a Boris Johnson government and the threat of a no-deal Brexit.\u201d Labour received only 1,680 votes, just barely holding on to its deposit after being beaten into fourth place by the Brexit party (3,331). Ukip came last, behind even the Monster Raving Loony party.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Dam emergency \u2013 </strong>Workers have been racing overnight to stop the Toddbrook dam in Derbyshire from bursting by dumping hundreds of tonnes of aggregate to divert water away from the wall, which has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/aug/01/uk-weather-homes-evacuated-floods-hit-north-of-england\">partly collapsed due to heavy rainfall</a>. Parts of Whaley Bridge have been evacuated with up to 1,400 people spending the night in shelters. Police have closed railway lines in the area, East Midlands Trains has announced. Trains on the route between Liverpool Lime Street and Norwich are disrupted due to the predicted flooding. \u201cOur trains are not able to run between Sheffield and Liverpool Lime Street and customers are advised to use alternative routes to travel.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Alzheimer\u2019s test holds promise \u2013 </strong>A blood test that can <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/aug/02/alzheimers-test-predicts-onset-up-to-20-years-in-advance\">detect signs of Alzheimer\u2019s disease as much as 20 years before its onset</a> has been developed. Scientists at the Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis in Missouri believe it is 94% accurate while being much cheaper and simpler than a brain scan. The test measures levels of amyloid beta protein, a key indicator of Alzheimer\u2019s, and combines it with analysis of age and genetic risk factors. Researchers say clumps of the protein begin to form in the brain up to two decades before the onset of the characteristic memory loss. However, the benefits of such testing would not be seen to their fullest extent until treatments to halt Alzheimer\u2019s are developed.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Crosby\u2019s Facebook dark arts empire \u2013 </strong>The lobbying firm CTF Partners, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/01/revealed-johnson-allys-firm-secretly-ran-facebook-propaganda-network\">run by Boris Johnson\u2019s close ally Sir Lynton Crosby</a>, has secretly built a network of unbranded \u201cnews\u201d pages on Facebook for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/01/brexit-cycle-lanes-and-saudi-arabia-ctfs-facebook-campaigns\">dozens of clients ranging from the Saudi government to major polluters</a>. The Guardian can reveal, for example, that the company took millions from the Saudi Arabian government to burnish the reputation of Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, who has subsequently been implicated in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. CTF also specialises in fighting regulation by seeking to influence key politicians, with campaigns in support of coal power, tobacco, and against cyclists. The discoveries show up flaws in Facebook\u2019s tools that are supposed to ensure political transparency. Meanwhile some current and former staff members have spoken about what they described as incidents of misogynistic bullying at CTF. One digital strategist, Sean Topham, gained a reputation for misogyny within the company, according to three former staff, who said he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/01/claims-of-misogynistic-culture-at-offices-of-lynton-crosby-firm\">celebrated the fact a woman had been forced out of the office as a \u201cconfirmed kill\u201d</a>.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>No-deal crisis fears ratchet up \u2013 </strong>The UK is now less able to cope with a hard Brexit on 31 October than it was in the spring, a document circulating in Whitehall shows. The Cabinet Office has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/01/uk-less-able-to-cope-with-hard-brexit-than-in-spring-say-officials\">stiffened its language around \u201creasonable worst-case scenarios\u201d</a> to include medicine shortages; disruptions to the food supply chain and panic buying; demonstrations and civil disorder that would stretch the police thin; and the risk that low-income groups will be hit by price rises on food, fuel and utilities. In a further blow to government attempts to play down the risks of no-deal Brexit, Sky News says it has obtained an official document setting out the threats to borders, the economy, security, data, Northern Ireland and individuals. \u201cLaw and order challenges\u201d in Northern Ireland, gaps in security and difficulty for Britons returning from abroad are among predictions.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Dodds wins Brecon and Radnorshire for Lib Dems Hello, Warren Murray with a write-up to get you right up with the news. Boris Johnson has suffered a major blow after the Tories were beaten by the anti-Brexit Liberal Democrats in the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection. It cuts the Conservatives\u2019 working majority in the Commons to just one. The Lib Dems\u2019 Jane Dodds won 13,826 votes with the Conservatives taking 12,401 \u2013 a margin of 1,425 that overturned the Tories\u2019 previous majority of more than 8,000. We are covering all the reaction live this morning. In her acceptance speech, Dodds pledged: \u201cMy very first act as your MP when I arrive in Westminster will be to find Mr Boris Johnson, wherever he\u2019s hiding, and tell him loud and clear: stop playing with the futures of our communities and rule out a no-deal Brexit. \u201cPeople are desperately crying out for a different kind of politics. There is no time for tribalism when our country is faced with a Boris Johnson government and the threat of a no-deal Brexit.\u201d Labour received only 1,680 votes, just barely holding on to its deposit after being beaten into fourth place by the Brexit party (3,331). Ukip came last, behind even the Monster Raving Loony party. * * * Dam emergency \u2013 Workers have been racing overnight to stop the Toddbrook dam in Derbyshire from bursting by dumping hundreds of tonnes of aggregate to divert water away from the wall, which has partly collapsed due to heavy rainfall. Parts of Whaley Bridge have been evacuated with up to 1,400 people spending the night in shelters. Police have closed railway lines in the area, East Midlands Trains has announced. Trains on the route between Liverpool Lime Street and Norwich are disrupted due to the predicted flooding. \u201cOur trains are not able to run between Sheffield and Liverpool Lime Street and customers are advised to use alternative routes to travel.\u201d * * * Alzheimer\u2019s test holds promise \u2013 A blood test that can detect signs of Alzheimer\u2019s disease as much as 20 years before its onset has been developed. Scientists at the Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis in Missouri believe it is 94% accurate while being much cheaper and simpler than a brain scan. The test measures levels of amyloid beta protein, a key indicator of Alzheimer\u2019s, and combines it with analysis of age and genetic risk factors. Researchers say clumps of the protein begin to form in the brain up to two decades before the onset of the characteristic memory loss. However, the benefits of such testing would not be seen to their fullest extent until treatments to halt Alzheimer\u2019s are developed. * * * Crosby\u2019s Facebook dark arts empire \u2013 The lobbying firm CTF Partners, run by Boris Johnson\u2019s close ally Sir Lynton Crosby, has secretly built a network of unbranded \u201cnews\u201d pages on Facebook for dozens of clients ranging from the Saudi government to major polluters. The Guardian can reveal, for example, that the company took millions from the Saudi Arabian government to burnish the reputation of Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, who has subsequently been implicated in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. CTF also specialises in fighting regulation by seeking to influence key politicians, with campaigns in support of coal power, tobacco, and against cyclists. The discoveries show up flaws in Facebook\u2019s tools that are supposed to ensure political transparency. Meanwhile some current and former staff members have spoken about what they described as incidents of misogynistic bullying at CTF. One digital strategist, Sean Topham, gained a reputation for misogyny within the company, according to three former staff, who said he celebrated the fact a woman had been forced out of the office as a \u201cconfirmed kill\u201d. * * * No-deal crisis fears ratchet up \u2013 The UK is now less able to cope with a hard Brexit on 31 October than it was in the spring, a document circulating in Whitehall shows. The Cabinet Office has stiffened its language around \u201creasonable worst-case scenarios\u201d to include medicine shortages; disruptions to the food supply chain and panic buying; demonstrations and civil disorder that would stretch the police thin; and the risk that low-income groups will be hit by price rises on food, fuel and utilities. In a further blow to government attempts to play down the risks of no-deal Brexit, Sky News says it has obtained an official document setting out the threats to borders, the economy, security, data, Northern Ireland and individuals. \u201cLaw and order challenges\u201d in Northern Ireland, gaps in security and difficulty for Britons returning from abroad are among predictions. Today in our Johnson\u2019s Promises series: will the new PM rise to the challenge of Britain\u2019s housing crisis? * * * Saudi women poised for travel freedom \u2013 Women in Saudi Arabia over the age of 21 will no longer need the permission of a male guardian to travel, according to local news reports. The policy, if confirmed, would put them on an equal footing with men in being able to apply for a passport and travel outside the country, without approval. They would also have the same right as men to register births and deaths. The Okaz newspaper did not say where it got the information but the country\u2019s official gazette has reportedly foreshadowed amendments to travel rules, labour laws and civil status laws. Today in Focus podcast: Water crisis driving migration to US Nina Lakhani explores how drought and famine are fuelling the wave of migration from Central America to the US. Plus: Emma Graham-Harrison on China and the Hong Kong protests. Lunchtime read: \u2018The tyranny of the ideal woman\u2019 \u201cMost women believe themselves to be independent thinkers. Even glossy women\u2019s magazines now model skepticism toward top-down narratives about how we should look, who and when we should marry, how we should live. But the psychological parasite of the ideal woman has evolved to survive in an ecosystem that pretends to resist her,\u201d writes Jia Tolentino. \u201cThe work formerly carried out by makeup has been embedded directly into her face: her cheekbones or lips have been plumped up, or some lines have been filled in. \u201cThe same is true of her body, which no longer requires the traditional enhancements of clothing or strategic underwear; it has been pre-shaped by exercise that ensures there is little to conceal or rearrange. If women start to resist an aesthetic, like the overapplication of Photoshop, the aesthetic just changes to suit us; the power of the ideal image never actually wanes. It is now easy enough to engage women\u2019s skepticism toward ads and magazine covers, images produced by professionals. It is harder for us to suspect images produced by our peers, and nearly impossible to get us to suspect the images we produce of ourselves.\u201d Sport Steve Smith shrugged off the boos on day one of the first Ashes Test to score a masterful comeback century that, combined with a series-threatening injury to Jimmy Anderson, leaves England battling for control of the opening match at Edgbaston. Charley Hull showed Rory McIlroy how to tee off at a home major on her way to a serene first-round 67 at the Women\u2019s British Open. Zak Hardaker\u2019s late drop goal ensured victory for Wigan in a thrilling Super League encounter at Hull to strengthen their play-off credentials.

Pathetic Fallacy also confronts something that eco-theatre has been coy about: the environmental impact of making and touring theatre shows.

I don\u2019t think of it as a political problem.\u201d Alanna Mitchell is assessing the climate emergency. \u201cI think of it as a cultural problem.\u201d The Canadian journalist and playwright believes the arts play a key role in transforming public opinion. \u201cThat\u2019s the way humans understand the world,\u201d insists Mitchell. \u201cWe understand it in terms of narrative.\u201d Some of the most successful environmental activism has used theatrical or artistic gestures to capture imaginations. Think of Extinction Rebellion\u2019s dramatic funeral marches, or Liberate Tate\u2019s oil spill installations. At the Edinburgh festival this month, theatre-makers are bringing the crisis to the fore, from drawing the links between colonialism and the changing climate in Kiinalik: These Sharp Tools to Tom Bailey\u2019s meditation on the sixth mass extinction in Vigil. Theatre is not Mitchell\u2019s natural environment. \u201cI\u2019m not a performer, I\u2019m a journalist,\u201d she stresses. But transforming her 2010 book Sea Sick into a solo show allowed her to reach different audiences with her message about the terrifying impact of carbon emissions on our seas. \u201cWe are changing the chemistry of the ocean. And not just part of it \u2013 the whole global ocean down to a kilometre deep.\u201d Facing the magnitude of such findings can be overwhelming. As theatre-maker Anita Rochon puts it, the climate crisis throws into question our entire existence and ways of living. Her show Pathetic Fallacy, which is playing at Edinburgh\u2019s Canada Hub alongside Sea Sick, explores humanity\u2019s complex relationship with the elements, from weather gods to the naming of storms, circling around the climate crisis without ever directly discussing it. Pathetic Fallacy also confronts something that eco-theatre has been coy about: the environmental impact of making and touring theatre shows. The play is taken on by a different local actor at each performance, removing the need for Rochon to jet around the world. The British theatre company Boxed In are also trying to make the way in which theatre is made more environmentally friendly. Throughout the Edinburgh fringe, their purpose-built venue The Greenhouse \u2013 constructed entirely from recycled materials and doing without mains electricity \u2013 will be hosting shows and workshops responding to the climate emergency.

The EU has been investigating specialist artificial turf used on sports fields for suspected carcinogens, and is considering banning intentionally added microplastics.

However, this can only be done at specialist plants in Europe and it is doubtful that many customers would go the extra mile.</p> <p>Guy Barter, chief horticulturist at the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS), says there is a place for artificial turf as an alternative to paving slabs, gravel and particularly concrete, which is its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/mar/02/what-you-can-do-to-reduce-the-destructive-impact-of-concrete\">own environmental nightmare</a>. \u201cHard landscaping can be very expensive, and people fancy a bit of green in a small garden.

A lot of people just aren\u2019t interested \u2013 they don\u2019t have time in their busy lives.\u201d</p> <p>There are some environmental benefits to using artificial grass. Unlike a real lawn, fake grass doesn\u2019t need to be mowed \u2013 which some people do with electric or fossil fuel mowers \u2013 or watered, which is a serious consideration as the UK anticipates <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/18/england-to-run-short-of-water-within-25-years-environment-agency\">increasing water stress</a> due to the climate crisis.</p> <p>Nor does it require fertilisers or herbicides, some of which have been subject to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/09/spray-pray-is-roundup-carcinogenic-monsanto-farmers-suing\">huge controversy</a>, to achieve a uniform look.</p> <p>But lawns can also be maintained without those negative practices and products, and the soil loss problem is real: the RHS\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jul/01/sue-biggs-rhs-horticultural-timebomb\">Greening Grey Britain survey</a> has found a threefold rise in the number of front gardens that have been paved over.</p> <p>Barter also challenges the idea that artificial turf is maintenance-free, saying it still needs to be cleaned of litter and moss growth, and some owners have simply replaced mowing with vacuuming.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/may/10/us-cities-losing-millions-of-trees-a-year\">US cities losing 36 million trees a year, researchers find</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere are better solutions that would give people more pleasure than just looking out at this sheet of slowly degrading plastic,\u201d he says.</p> <p>He suggests planting shady front gardens with tolerant shrubs, such as evergreen bushes: these provide greenery all year round, need little maintenance, suppress weeds, offer food for wildlife and places for birds to nest, and give hedgehogs and frogs cover to travel safely in urban streets. \u201cAfter all, we are supposed to be a nation of gardeners.\u201d</p> <p>To Trevor Dines, botanical specialist for charity Plantlife, the popularity of artificial grass shows how disconnected we have become from the natural world. \u201cWhenever I see artificial grass my heart sinks \u2013 more nature smothered by more plastic.

For example, Royal Grass says its environmentally friendly turf, called Eco-Sense, is recyclable (\u201cin other words, cradle-to-cradle\u201d) and declares that it \u201chas the look and feel of natural grass, but outperforms its natural source of inspiration\u201d: \u201c\u2018Green\u2019 is a premium goal in our quest on how we can make our artificial grass more sustainable. This starts at the beginning of the process, with the careful selection of the raw materials that are used to produce the grass blades.\u201d But while the fake grass might indeed be greener, at least in colour, its environmental impacts are difficult to gloss over. Paul Hetherington, fundraising director for the charity Buglife, says artificial turf is far from an eco-friendly alternative to natural grass. \u201cIt blocks access to the soil beneath for burrowing insects, such as solitary bees, and the ground above for soil dwellers such as worms, which will be starved of food beneath it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt provides food for absolutely no living creatures.\u201d This is a particular concern in view of the dramatic global decline in insect species. The UK is on course to miss its own targets for protecting its natural spaces, and has lost 97% of its wildflower meadows in a single generation. It is not just wildlife that artificial turf affects. The Committee on Climate Change recommends rewilding a huge area of UK land and growing many more trees to help tackle global heating by storing carbon. Not only does fake grass have no climate benefits, but producing the plastic emits carbon and uses fossil fuels. The common practice of replacing soil with sand to provide a more stable bed for the fake grass also releases even more CO2 stored in the earth, according to David Elliott, chief executive of tree-planting charity Trees for Cities. There is also the matter of microplastics: the tiny particles of plastic that have made their way throughout the globe, and are present in our food, water and even the air. Evergreen UK\u2019s turf is made mainly of polyethylene, with polypropylene and polyamide for some purposes. Driver claims the microplastics problem does not affect the artificial grass industry because it doesn\u2019t sell single-use products. \u201cOur products don\u2019t degrade, we\u2019ve always not had it as an issue, basically.\u201d He adds that products from legitimate firms conform to standards set by the industry. Madeleine Berg, project manager at the environmental charity Fidra, counters that most plastics are likely to contribute to microplastics through physical and chemical degradation, such as being stepped on and exposed to constant sunlight. \u201cYou would be hard-pressed to say that you have created a product which doesn\u2019t shed anything,\u201d says Berg. There are also growing concerns about the impact of the synthetic chemicals that are added to artificial grass on human health and the environment. The EU has been investigating specialist artificial turf used on sports fields for suspected carcinogens, and is considering banning intentionally added microplastics. While these are different products to those sold to home gardeners, Berg says artificial pitches are sometimes reused for landscaping. And what happens to fake grass when it reaches the end of its life in 10-20 years? Unlike Royal Grass, Evergreens UK doesn\u2019t market itself as eco-friendly, a term Driver calls \u201ca little bit misleading\u201d, but he is keen to stress that his company\u2019s products can be recycled. However, this can only be done at specialist plants in Europe and it is doubtful that many customers would go the extra mile. Guy Barter, chief horticulturist at the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS), says there is a place for artificial turf as an alternative to paving slabs, gravel and particularly concrete, which is its own environmental nightmare. \u201cHard landscaping can be very expensive, and people fancy a bit of green in a small garden. We\u2019ve even laid a bit [of artificial grass] ourselves. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think that for all but specialised purposes that it really compares with [real] grass. Not only does it not provide any of the environmental benefits of grass \u2013 like soaking up moisture, home for insects, feeding birds, self-sustaining \u2013 its life isn\u2019t that long. It gets trampled on and quite soon looks poor. It can\u2019t be relaid or reseeded; it has to be rolled up, lifted and sent to landfill.\u201d Barter concedes that the root of the problem is social pressure for a perfect green lawn. \u201cIn the mindset of the British public you haven\u2019t really got a garden unless you\u2019ve got a lawn,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I think a lot of people are put off by lawns because there\u2019s so much quite confusing technical speak around it like mowing, feeding, weeding, moss control and overseeding. A lot of people just aren\u2019t interested \u2013 they don\u2019t have time in their busy lives.\u201d There are some environmental benefits to using artificial grass. Unlike a real lawn, fake grass doesn\u2019t need to be mowed \u2013 which some people do with electric or fossil fuel mowers \u2013 or watered, which is a serious consideration as the UK anticipates increasing water stress due to the climate crisis. Nor does it require fertilisers or herbicides, some of which have been subject to huge controversy, to achieve a uniform look. But lawns can also be maintained without those negative practices and products, and the soil loss problem is real: the RHS\u2019 Greening Grey Britain survey has found a threefold rise in the number of front gardens that have been paved over. Barter also challenges the idea that artificial turf is maintenance-free, saying it still needs to be cleaned of litter and moss growth, and some owners have simply replaced mowing with vacuuming. \u201cThere are better solutions that would give people more pleasure than just looking out at this sheet of slowly degrading plastic,\u201d he says. He suggests planting shady front gardens with tolerant shrubs, such as evergreen bushes: these provide greenery all year round, need little maintenance, suppress weeds, offer food for wildlife and places for birds to nest, and give hedgehogs and frogs cover to travel safely in urban streets. \u201cAfter all, we are supposed to be a nation of gardeners.\u201d To Trevor Dines, botanical specialist for charity Plantlife, the popularity of artificial grass shows how disconnected we have become from the natural world. \u201cWhenever I see artificial grass my heart sinks \u2013 more nature smothered by more plastic. Where once we were famed for our lawns, we now opt for artificial, low-maintenance solutions. \u201cThis is not just to the detriment of wildlife but to us, too; children can\u2019t make a daisy-chain on a plastic lawn.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter",

Two decades on, Mulholland Drive feels like a premonition, a lavish closing-night shebang before the greater part of the movie industry divided itself between micro-budgets and television. But Tarantino remained in old Hollywood, a diligent caretaker, tending to the legends. Who knows? Endings can be treacherous. Among observers of the Weinstein legal case, there is pained speculation about the fallout should the producer not be convicted at his rape trial this year. Could the queasiest of comebacks be ruled out? For all its nostalgia, the film business has a famously short memory. And in a world where nothing sounds as loudly as the cash register, Tarantino may find his commitment to retirement tested if Once Upon a Time in Hollywood keeps triumphing at the box office. Maybe that would be his preferred plot twist after all \u2013 the last living director left among the ghosts. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is released in the UK on 15 August.",

When I travel I always sweep my hotel rooms or Airbnbs for surveillance devices left by voyeurs. They\u2019re more common than people think. I don\u2019t carry a gun. I\u2019ve rarely felt unsafe, except when I was younger and worked as a process server. You have no idea how people will react to receiving court papers. Though I had one woman who was delighted to be served with divorce. She was jumping up and down, saying: \u201cThank you! Thank you!\u201d In New York, where you have a lot of conservative religious or ethnic groups, people often want the services of PIs because they are trying to prevent their children from marrying outside the group. Once an Orthodox Jewish man was convinced his daughter\u2019s fiance was secretly gay and taking his daughter for a ride. The fiance had refined, somewhat effete tastes that didn\u2019t fit the standard American image of masculinity. But I didn\u2019t see any evidence he was gay. He was just European. People are surprised when I tell them this, but sometimes being investigated by a PI is the best thing that can happen to you. You might learn potential liabilities about yourself that you didn\u2019t know. And if your background is clean, that\u2019s a huge psychological relief.",

Europe, with its own demons to face, has its red lines too and will not sacrifice the single market or its external borders, or jeopardise the wider integrity of the European project. Ireland, and the fragile peace process that has been built over the past 20 years, falls between these two positions.</p> <p>And while it is still early days for the Johnson premiership, we have a deteriorated state of Anglo-Irish relations following his ascent to power. How real is the damaging rhetoric emanating from London and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/31/leo-varadkar-media-telegraph-sun-irish-taoiseach-brexit\" title=\"\">anti-Irish tropes spewing from much of the British media</a>? David Yelland, the former editor of the Sun, revealed that he had been shocked when \u201cTories of influence\u201d told him privately that Leo Varadkar, Ireland\u2019s taoiseach \u201cisn\u2019t bright\u201d and \u201cthe Irish will blink\u201d. \u201cIt seems, amazingly, that this is the actual policy of HMG under Johnson,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidyelland/status/1155890580884512770\" title=\"\">tweeted Yelland</a>. \u201cThey are anti-Irish, arrogant, dangerous and wrong.\u201d</p> <p>That relations between London and Dublin are now strained is beyond dispute, though officials in Dublin insist that much of the noise is to be expected and aimed at a domestic UK audience rather than Ireland or the EU.</p> <p>Still, following his appointment, it took almost a week for Johnson to place a phone call with Varadkar, who leads a confidence-and-supply coalition that \u2013 while shaky on a series of domestic issues \u2013 serves as a national government in all but name for the purposes of Brexit. When the phone call did proceed, both men adopted an uncompromising stance: Johnson insisting the removal of the backstop is a precondition for any deal, Varadkar adamant that the EU will not relent on the withdrawal agreement.</p> <p>Varadkar rightly reminded Johnson of the British government\u2019s obligation \u2013 as a co-signatory of the Good Friday agreement \u2013 to exercise its power in respect of Northern Ireland with rigorous impartiality. Johnson\u2019s government relies, for the time being, on the support in the Commons of the Democratic Unionist party to prop up its narrow majority. The difficult parliamentary arithmetic, combined with Johnson\u2019s inflammatory rhetoric, represents a serious challenge to the UK\u2019s obligation to act as an honest broker in respect of Northern Ireland \u2013 the majority of whose citizens voted, like their Scottish brethren, to stay in the EU.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"723712278d7319f9dbecd6214a34428204a5630f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/723712278d7319f9dbecd6214a34428204a5630f/1_0_2559_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Irish taoiseach Leo Varadkar and UK prime minister Boris Johnson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Irish taoiseach Leo Varadkar and UK prime minister Boris Johnson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex and PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And although unionists are being comforted, for now, by Johnson, their confidence that a hard Brexit will not give birth to a united Ireland must also be fraying at the seams. This is not least because nearly two-thirds of the Tory party indicate in polling that they would rather <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/politics/news/104672/grassroots-tories-would-sacrifice-union-if-it-meant-brexit-being\" title=\"\">sacrifice the union</a> \u2013 and see Northern Ireland and Scotland leave it \u2013 than abandon Brexit.</p> <p>Johnson (just like his predecessors) has yet to offer any meaningful alternatives to the backstop, yet blindly insists, as a pre-condition to talks with Brussels, that it must be removed. Given such a hardline starting point, what compromises would a deal with Brussels before October 31 entail? The recent ITV interview with the foreign secretary Dominic Raab on the issue of what flexibility the UK government has shown to date does not augur well for what lies ahead.</p> <p>The high-handed, perhaps not entirely unexpected tone of the hard Brexiteers, including Johnson, has undoubtedly reawakened bad memories in Ireland. Nobody on the island is blind to the reality that in standing by the backstop in order to avoid a hard border, they could end up with one if the UK crashes out without a deal. Indeed, the Irish government has conceded, in its latest updated contingency action plan, that it will implement increased checks and procedures in the event of a no-deal Brexit. That means border infrastructure and checkpoints that, however they are named and wherever they are, will have social and economic consequences both foreseen and unforeseen.</p> <p>One of those consequences is the possibility of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/13/no-deal-brexit-would-lead-to-vote-on-united-ireland-says-sinn-fein\" title=\"\">united Ireland</a> \u2013 a prospect that terrifies me if the process of getting there is not given the time and breadth it needs, and if that existential, constitutional question it is not curated with the utmost inclusiveness and sensitivity.</p> <p>Last week <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/varadkar-says-no-deal-brexit-could-break-up-uk-1.3968821\" title=\"\">Varadkar stated the obvious</a> when he told the MacGill summer school that a hard Brexit would force communities in Northern Ireland to consider the possibility of a united Ireland. They already are. What was once an entirely fringe aspiration for nationalists, and a dreaded fear for unionists \u2013 each side comforted by the thought that the conversation about unification was decades away \u2013 has become an urgent debate for all.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/01/boris-johnson-reckless-peace-in-ireland-irish-border\">Expecting Ireland to be servile is part of a long British tradition | Richard McMahon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Contrary to anti-Irish tropes that the backstop is a Trojan horse in order to secure a united Ireland, the truth is that both communities in Northern Ireland \u2013 as well as citizens across the island of Ireland \u2013 are fearful of what a botched, rushed conversation about unification might yield. That fear is that the birth of a united Ireland would be accompanied by violence and upheaval.</p> <p>Unification without the support of unionists, whose traditions and identity must be protected as part of any shared future, cannot be pursued as a zero-sum game. Otherwise we risk repeating history: the Troubles in reverse. Northern Ireland could not, in its current perilous state, survive either a hard Brexit or a united Ireland. Its communities are suspended in an in-between space, in which they have enjoyed 21 years without violence but have not yet progressed to a positive peace or meaningful integration \u2013 a process that takes time and effort to heal wounds.</p> <p>What many people in the UK forget or are indifferent to is the fact that, for all the successes of the Good Friday agreement \u2013 a vital edifice that allows us to identify as British, Irish or both \u2013 peace is not fully won.</p> <p>That is why all the trash talk is so damaging, and why we need to pull back from the rhetorical brink. That is what is lost in this war of the Ultras: that the price of political power could be the unforgiveable loss of peace.</p> <p>\u2022 Dearbhail McDonald is an Irish commentator and the author of Bust</p>",

      "bodyText": "In The Ultras, the brutal, brilliant novel by Eoin McNamee set during the Troubles, the protagonist (based on the real-life undercover British intelligence officer Robert Nairac) finds himself in the company of dangerous men like himself. The Ultras plot terrible events and create dark polities while forcing everyone else to live with their consequences. \u201cUltra meaning beyond,\u201d wrote McNamee. \u201cUltra meaning extreme.\u201d The so-called war cabinet formed by the new British prime minister, Boris Johnson, and whose course the maverick arch-Brexiteer Dominic Cummings now charts, of course bears no resemblance to the characters in the war of the Ultras imagined by McNamee. But the sheer velocity and ferocity of their opening salvoes about crashing out of the EU with no deal on October 31 unless the backstop \u2013 the insurance policy to avoid a hard border in Ireland \u2013 is abolished, raise the kind of alarm that we in Ireland have not felt since the dark years of the Troubles. The political fear is that this new breed of \u201cBrexit Ultras\u201d (Johnson\u2019s cabinet with Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party snapping at its heels) could deliberately pursue a no-deal EU exit at the expense of a volatile Irish peace. The sabre-rattling and pre-emptive blame-shifting of course is intended to shore up political support in the UK ahead of a possible general election, but also to intimidate Ireland into abandoning the backstop while shaking the unity of the EU27. Europe, with its own demons to face, has its red lines too and will not sacrifice the single market or its external borders, or jeopardise the wider integrity of the European project. Ireland, and the fragile peace process that has been built over the past 20 years, falls between these two positions. And while it is still early days for the Johnson premiership, we have a deteriorated state of Anglo-Irish relations following his ascent to power. How real is the damaging rhetoric emanating from London and the anti-Irish tropes spewing from much of the British media? David Yelland, the former editor of the Sun, revealed that he had been shocked when \u201cTories of influence\u201d told him privately that Leo Varadkar, Ireland\u2019s taoiseach \u201cisn\u2019t bright\u201d and \u201cthe Irish will blink\u201d. \u201cIt seems, amazingly, that this is the actual policy of HMG under Johnson,\u201d tweeted Yelland. \u201cThey are anti-Irish, arrogant, dangerous and wrong.\u201d That relations between London and Dublin are now strained is beyond dispute, though officials in Dublin insist that much of the noise is to be expected and aimed at a domestic UK audience rather than Ireland or the EU. Still, following his appointment, it took almost a week for Johnson to place a phone call with Varadkar, who leads a confidence-and-supply coalition that \u2013 while shaky on a series of domestic issues \u2013 serves as a national government in all but name for the purposes of Brexit. When the phone call did proceed, both men adopted an uncompromising stance: Johnson insisting the removal of the backstop is a precondition for any deal, Varadkar adamant that the EU will not relent on the withdrawal agreement. Varadkar rightly reminded Johnson of the British government\u2019s obligation \u2013 as a co-signatory of the Good Friday agreement \u2013 to exercise its power in respect of Northern Ireland with rigorous impartiality. Johnson\u2019s government relies, for the time being, on the support in the Commons of the Democratic Unionist party to prop up its narrow majority. The difficult parliamentary arithmetic, combined with Johnson\u2019s inflammatory rhetoric, represents a serious challenge to the UK\u2019s obligation to act as an honest broker in respect of Northern Ireland \u2013 the majority of whose citizens voted, like their Scottish brethren, to stay in the EU. And although unionists are being comforted, for now, by Johnson, their confidence that a hard Brexit will not give birth to a united Ireland must also be fraying at the seams. This is not least because nearly two-thirds of the Tory party indicate in polling that they would rather sacrifice the union \u2013 and see Northern Ireland and Scotland leave it \u2013 than abandon Brexit. Johnson (just like his predecessors) has yet to offer any meaningful alternatives to the backstop, yet blindly insists, as a pre-condition to talks with Brussels, that it must be removed. Given such a hardline starting point, what compromises would a deal with Brussels before October 31 entail? The recent ITV interview with the foreign secretary Dominic Raab on the issue of what flexibility the UK government has shown to date does not augur well for what lies ahead. The high-handed, perhaps not entirely unexpected tone of the hard Brexiteers, including Johnson, has undoubtedly reawakened bad memories in Ireland. Nobody on the island is blind to the reality that in standing by the backstop in order to avoid a hard border, they could end up with one if the UK crashes out without a deal. Indeed, the Irish government has conceded, in its latest updated contingency action plan, that it will implement increased checks and procedures in the event of a no-deal Brexit. That means border infrastructure and checkpoints that, however they are named and wherever they are, will have social and economic consequences both foreseen and unforeseen. One of those consequences is the possibility of a united Ireland \u2013 a prospect that terrifies me if the process of getting there is not given the time and breadth it needs, and if that existential, constitutional question it is not curated with the utmost inclusiveness and sensitivity. Last week Varadkar stated the obvious when he told the MacGill summer school that a hard Brexit would force communities in Northern Ireland to consider the possibility of a united Ireland. They already are. What was once an entirely fringe aspiration for nationalists, and a dreaded fear for unionists \u2013 each side comforted by the thought that the conversation about unification was decades away \u2013 has become an urgent debate for all. Contrary to anti-Irish tropes that the backstop is a Trojan horse in order to secure a united Ireland, the truth is that both communities in Northern Ireland \u2013 as well as citizens across the island of Ireland \u2013 are fearful of what a botched, rushed conversation about unification might yield. That fear is that the birth of a united Ireland would be accompanied by violence and upheaval. Unification without the support of unionists, whose traditions and identity must be protected as part of any shared future, cannot be pursued as a zero-sum game. Otherwise we risk repeating history: the Troubles in reverse. Northern Ireland could not, in its current perilous state, survive either a hard Brexit or a united Ireland. Its communities are suspended in an in-between space, in which they have enjoyed 21 years without violence but have not yet progressed to a positive peace or meaningful integration \u2013 a process that takes time and effort to heal wounds. What many people in the UK forget or are indifferent to is the fact that, for all the successes of the Good Friday agreement \u2013 a vital edifice that allows us to identify as British, Irish or both \u2013 peace is not fully won. That is why all the trash talk is so damaging, and why we need to pull back from the rhetorical brink. That is what is lost in this war of the Ultras: that the price of political power could be the unforgiveable loss of peace. \u2022 Dearbhail McDonald is an Irish commentator and the author of Bust",

Trump\u2019s numbers are bolstered in large part by support from Cubans, who have historically leaned Republican. Given Florida\u2019s notoriously close margins in elections \u2013 Trump carried the state over Hillary Clinton by just 1.3% in 2016 \u2013 even the slightest swing within the Latinx electorate could prove significant. \u201cIn Florida, there should be an all-out effort to connect with Latino voters on the Democratic side and not give up any ground at all,\u201d said Matt Barreto, the executive director of Latino Decisions. \u201cThere\u2019s a very legitimate concern and an important concern there.\u201d The Trump campaign unveiled its own efforts to woo the crucial voting bloc last month with a keen eye on Florida.

Democrats are also hoping to boost turnout among Latinx voters by highlighting the draconian policies Trump has pursued as president. In 2017, Trump rescinded protections for millions of young, undocumented immigrants, known as Dreamers, who were brought to the US unlawfully as children. He has attempted to end a program granting temporary legal status to hundreds of thousands of immigrants from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua and Sudan. And just last month, Trump took action to eliminate nearly all asylum claims for the countless migrants fleeing poverty and violence in Central America, currently blocked only by legal action. The ramifications of Trump\u2019s most controversial move on immigration \u2013 the so-called \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy that led to the separation of thousands of families at the US-Mexico border \u2013 have also spilled into full view. The conditions at migrant detention facilities have been derided as squalid and inhumane, drawing comparisons to concentration camps. There is also Trump\u2019s widely pilloried response to the hurricane that ravaged Puerto Rico in 2017 and the implications for Florida, which is home to more than a million Puerto Ricans. Trump infamously launched his 2016 presidential bid by declaring most Mexican immigrants were either rapists or drug traffickers. As a candidate, he went on to question the impartiality of a Hispanic judge, called for sweeping deportations of undocumented immigrants and made building a wall along the US-Mexico border the central promise of his campaign. His rallies routinely featured victims of family members who were killed by an undocumented immigrant \u2013 a deliberate effort to tie immigrants to crime despite studies showing immigrants are less likely to commit crime than the native-born US population. Top Republican leaders wondered aloud if Trump might damage the Republican party\u2019s relationship with Latinx voters beyond repair. When the 2016 election came to pass, less than 30% of Latinx voters supported Trump at the polls. The numbers were, however, on par with those of Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, who struggled with immigration but did not cut nearly as controversial a figure as Trump. \u201cI thought his campaign rhetoric was offensive and he would pay a bigger price, but I really didn\u2019t see him suffering percentage-wise compared to John McCain and Mitt Romney\u2019s number,\u201d said Al C\u00e1rdenas, a Republican lobbyist who and former head of the Florida GOP. \u201cI grow more offended by the day, and I honestly don\u2019t see how if you\u2019re of Hispanic origin you\u2019re not taken back by the resulting hatred and racism,\u201d C\u00e1rdenas added. But not all Latinx voters are directly affected by Trump\u2019s restrictive measures on immigration, C\u00e1rdenas noted. And if the economy remains stable under Trump\u2019s watch, the bloc of voters who are uncomfortable with his rhetoric might be willing to once again look the other way if they feel personally better off. Recent polls have found Trump\u2019s overall support among Latinx voters fluctuating between 18% and 27%. Data from the 2018 midterm elections suggested the percentage of Latinx voters who cast their ballots for Republicans was similar to Trump\u2019s numbers in 2016. In Florida, several statewide elections fell within such close margins that they triggered an automatic recount. Among them was the high-profile US Senate race, which saw the Republican Rick Scott elected by just over 10,000 votes, bolstered in part by Puerto Rican voters in central Florida. \u201cRepublicans don\u2019t necessarily have to win over a whole constituency, but just a few percentage points in some key counties can really make a difference in Florida,\u201d said Andrea Mercado, the executive director of New Florida Majority, a progressive political organizing group. Her message to Democrats was simple. \u201cThe work of engaging in communities early and often is going to be critical and a game-changer,\u201d Mercado said.",

He has promised to rapidly renegotiate almost all of May\u2019s departure deal, ditching the Irish backstop border guarantee policy \u2013 something that would seem a huge task over any timescale, let alone little more than 12 weeks, a fair proportion of which is taken up by a summer break.

The situation in the gulf is complex, fast-moving and hugely dangerous. Johnson did not cover himself in glory as foreign secretary, especially over Iran. It will be his task to prove he has learned.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Managing parliament and Tory MPs</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Johnson will start as PM with a working Commons majority of four, thanks to the DUP, but within weeks it is likely to be down to three if as expected the Liberal Democrats win in the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection.

This is a huge workload for any new administration.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Being prime ministerial</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Critics might say this is Johnson\u2019s single biggest challenge.

Johnson has a tendency to ignore advice, pluck statistics out of the air and rely on sudden, cheap glibness. Curbing these long habits will be a daily struggle - his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jul/24/meet-the-new-dude-at-no-10-papers-greet-boris-johnsons-victory\">adopting the acronym 'Dude' in his victory speech</a> shows just how hard it is for him.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/peterwalker\"><b>Peter Walker</b></a>&nbsp;<i>Political correspondent</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In his first speech as prime minister, Johnson talked of uniting the country, safer streets, better education and better road and rail infrastructure.

Many are pinning their hopes on the man who will be a crucial aide in Johnson\u2019s government, his new chief of staff, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/23/who-will-be-among-boris-johnson-core-team-of-aides\">Sir Edward Lister</a>.</p> \n<p>Lister was Johnson\u2019s righthand man in the Mayor of London\u2019s office, and a key figure during his prime ministerial campaign.

But critics say the definition of what constitutes an affordable home was changed, so figures aren\u2019t comparable.

He approved the project \u2013 despite local authority objections \u2013 with just 98 of the 681 homes deemed as affordable. However, a housing policy that ignores affordability will have a negative impact on a Johnson premiership.</p> \n<p>Just 6,000 new homes at an affordable social rent were let in the whole of England in 2017/18, compared to nearly 40,000 in 2010/11, and shared ownership/affordable homes for purchase have also declined. Britain\u2019s housing market, as the government\u2019s own white paper in 2017 admitted, remains broken.</p>",

Johnson knows that if the property market cracks after a no-deal Brexit \u2013 and the Office for Budget Responsibility predicts a 10% fall in the event of a disorderly exit \u2013 then help to buy\u2019s liabilities could pose what the National Audit Office said is a \u201csignificant market risk\u201d for the government, because the taxpayer effectively owns a stake in every house bought under the scheme. But if Johnson pulls the plug on the scheme, he risks alienating young buyers as well as the giant builders traditionally close to the Conservative party. More likely will be measures to prop up the housing market in the wake of a no-deal Brexit, with reports of a \u00a33.8bn giveaway on stamp duty, cutting it to zero on homes below \u00a3500,000. First-time buyers and home-movers could also be helped by suggestions that stamp duty will be shifted from the buyer to the seller. But while it might be a vote-winner among the young, critics say it faces a rebellion from older sellers who will be deterred from putting their homes on the market and downsizing. Another test for Johnson will be whether he proceeds with Theresa May\u2019s surprise decision in April to scrap so-called \u201crevenge evictions\u201d under section 21 of the Housing Act. Even campaigners at Shelter were taken aback, hailing it as an \u201coutstanding victory for tenants\u201d. In an open letter to Boris Johnson this week, Shelter\u2019s chief executive, Polly Neate, pleaded for the ban to survive a Johnson administration. She said: \u201cYour predecessor took a vital step towards improving the lives of England\u2019s 11 million private renters when she unveiled plans to abolish \u2018no-fault\u2019 evictions. You can make these plans a reality by seeing through the crucial legislation a Conservative government has already committed to.\u201d There will also be pleas to improve not just the supply of housing, but of homes that are actually affordable to buy, or available for rent from councils and housing associations. As mayor of London Johnson claimed he out-built Labour, with more than 100,000 affordable homes. But critics say the definition of what constitutes an affordable home was changed, so figures aren\u2019t comparable. Johnson also cut targets for affordable housing, and frequently approved luxury developments in the city with only limited affordable homes. In the giant redevelopment of the Mount Pleasant former post office site in Islington he accused opponents of \u201cbourgeois nimbyism\u201d. He approved the project \u2013 despite local authority objections \u2013 with just 98 of the 681 homes deemed as affordable. However, a housing policy that ignores affordability will have a negative impact on a Johnson premiership. Just 6,000 new homes at an affordable social rent were let in the whole of England in 2017/18, compared to nearly 40,000 in 2010/11, and shared ownership/affordable homes for purchase have also declined. Britain\u2019s housing market, as the government\u2019s own white paper in 2017 admitted, remains broken.",

As to whether the media should be making the link between extreme weather events and climate change more frequently, Holmes suggests that people should be informed by the science where possible. \u201cFind the experts that deal with drought and allow the scientists to make the link,\u201d he suggests. \u201cThe best time to talk about [climate change] is during extreme weather events because people want to know what is going on.\u201d Notes Analysis of media coverage combined the following search term \u201cDrought AND (Australia OR Australian OR \u201cNew South Wales\u201d OR Victoria OR Queensland OR Tasmania OR \u201cSouth Australia\u201d OR \u201cNorthern Territory\u201d OR \u201cWestern Australia\u201d OR NT OR SA OR WA OR NSW OR ACT)\u201c with other phrases: \u201cclimate change\u201d, emissions, \u201cclimate change\u201d OR emissions, \u201crainfall patterns\u201d, \u201cdrought relief\u201d OR \u201cfinancial assistance\u201d, livestock OR cattle OR sheep, \u201cScott Morrison\u201d, \u201cMichael McCormack\u201d.

Several activists have gone on trial for \u201cgroup theft by deceit\u201d since the movement began five months ago.

      "bodyText": "It was a quiet Monday afternoon in the picturesque town hall of Lingolsheim, outside Strasbourg. The school summer holidays had started and it was exceptionally hot. But at 4pm something extraordinary happened. Eleven people calmly walked in, politely greeted the receptionists, then headed to the room usually reserved for council meetings. They carefully unhooked the picture of the French president, Emmanuel Macron \u2013 the type of portrait that hangs in all local administration buildings \u2013 gently placing it in a special protective pouch, and then walked out. The climate protesters took the portrait home and waited, wondering when the local gendarmes would knock on their doors. It was the latest act in an unusual and fast growing civil disobedience movement in France in which framed portraits of Macron have been taken down by protesters from more than 100 town halls, stretching from small Beaujolais villages to Normandy towns, from Biarritz to Paris, leading to a police crackdown and court appearances. \u201cThe blank space left on the wall symbolises the void in government policy on the climate emergency,\u201d the protesters said in a statement after the latest portrait seizure in Lingolsheim. Climate activists from the association ANV Action non-violente COP21 say the \u201cTake Down Macron\u201d campaign is a \u201cdesperate and urgent\u201d move to force France to do more about the climate emergency. Macron presents himself as a world leader in the fight against global heating, and the guarantor of the UN\u2019s 2015 Paris climate accord. He has challenged Donald Trump on the issue, vowing France would \u201cmake our planet great again\u201d. However, the nation\u2019s independent advisory council on the climate recently warned of a \u201cgap between ambition and reality\u201d . Its report said France was failing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions fast enough, particularly via road transport and buildings, and without major policy change was unlikely to meet its goals. France has a long history of civil disobedience on environmental and social issues, that has included a campaign by the farmer and activist Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9 to rip up GM crops, and a movement stressing that money lost in tax evasion could fund the fight against global heating. The removal of Macron\u2019s portraits, however, has a special symbolism that has captured the public\u2019s interest. French presidential portraits, which stare down on citizens from the walls of schools, town halls and government buildings, are a powerful sign of the republic. The basic portrait in a frame may be worth only a few euros, but as the economy minister, Bruno Le Maire, warned: \u201cYou don\u2019t attack symbols of the republic.\u201d The portrait activists, who have described themselves as normal, \u201cresolutely non-violent\u201d citizens, include public-sector workers, retired teachers, rail workers, students and small business employees. Last week, more than 1,000 people met at a climate camp in north-east France to prepare protest actions. Before taking each portrait of the president the activists carry out reconnaissance trips to the town halls. They do not cover their faces or hide their identities and often wear high-visibility jackets carrying their logo. But in a country preparing for the G7 summit at the end of August and still reeling from the gilets jaunes (yellow vests) movement, there has been a firm police response. Officers advised by the country\u2019s anti-terrorism force have questioned 89 people and carried out 72 searches of properties. Several activists have gone on trial for \u201cgroup theft by deceit\u201d since the movement began five months ago. More trials will take place in the autumn in cities including Paris, Lyon, Orl\u00e9ans and Grenoble. The group argues that each time they appear in court, public support grows. \u201cI asked myself what can I do to channel this anger I feel about the lack of real government action on the climate emergency?\u201d said Anne-Sophie Trujillo Gauchez, 46, an activist who works as a consultant and who previously ran international humanitarian missions for big charities. She lives in a Beaujolais village where she recycles goods and uses an electric bike. \u201cBut individual gestures like that are not enough without proper structural change in society.\u201d One Saturday morning in March, Trujillo Gauchez and 13 others entered the town hall of Jassans-Riottier and removed Macron\u2019s portrait from a wall adorned with every French leader since Charles de Gaulle. A few days later police appeared at her house with a summons. Trujillo Gauchez was among six activists who stood trial for \u201cgroup theft by deceit\u201d in the first portrait removal proceedings in May, in the eastern French town of Bourg-en-Bresse, as more than 300 activists stood outside chanting \u201cwe\u2019re all portrait removers!\u201d The head judge asked one activist during the trial if he agreed that taking the portrait could be seen as an attack on the authority of the state. He replied: \u201cI would hope the authority of the state isn\u2019t just a portrait hanging in a town hall room used for marriages.\u201d Each activist was convicted and received suspended fines of hundreds of euros, much less than the prison sentences and fines in the thousands of euros available to the court. But the state prosecutor has appealed, so a retrial will be scheduled to take place early next year. Christelle Mercier, a lawyer in the case, said the state\u2019s appeal over the sentences was disproportionate for a protest that was \u201cpurely symbolic\u201d. There are more trials to come. Thomas Fourrey, a lawyer preparing a defence in Lyon, said he would argue that the activists took down the portraits out of \u201cnecessity\u201d over the climate emergency. Marion Esnault, 30, the national spokesperson for the Take Down Macron campaign, will go on trial in September over two portraits taken from Paris town halls, along with the person who filmed the removal for YouTube. Other observers have been caught up. A journalists\u2019 union complained when local reporters covering a portrait removal in Normandy received police summons, first for taking part in group theft, then as witnesses. Esnault said it was symbolic that the court hosting the trial was also used for terrorist cases. \u201cIf France wants to position itself as a world leader on the climate emergency then it must at least respect its objectives,\u201d she said, adding the movement began just as Greenpeace and other organisations moved to take the French state to court to force it to respect environmental commitments. \u201cI think non-violent civil disobedience in France is going to increase as a form of action on this.\u201d Michael Kluger, 30, a biomechanics researcher, is among three activists recently cleared of group theft in Strasbourg after he took down Macron\u2019s portrait in Kolbsheim town hall, near a controversial motorway ringroad project.

      "bodyText": "The leader of a South Korean doomsday cult who held 400 people captive in Fiji and subjected them to violent beatings has been sentenced to six years in jail. Shin Ok-ju, founder of the Grace Road Church, convinced her followers to move to Fiji in 2014, which she said was the \u201cpromised land\u201d, pointed to in the Bible, where they would survive coming apocalyptic events. Once they arrived on the island their passports were confiscated. Those who left the group reported brutal rituals, called \u201cthreshing floors\u201d in which people were beaten as punishment for sinful actions or to drive out evil spirits. On Monday a South Korean court found Shin guilty on multiple criminal charges including violence, child abuse and fraud. \u201cThe victims suffered helplessly from collective beatings and experienced not only physical torture but also severe fear and considerable mental shock,\u201d said the Anyang sub-court of the Suwon district court. \u201cHeavy punishment is inevitable against illegal acts carried out in the name of religion,\u201d it added in a statement earlier this week. Shocking footage showing Shin beating her followers and ordering them to beat one another was shared with the Guardian by South Korean police last year. In several videos, Shin was shown calling members of the church forward during her sermons and then hitting them in the face, pulling and cutting their hair and throwing them to the ground. She was arrested along with three other church leaders when they landed at Incheon airport just outside the South Korean capital Seoul in July 2017. People have joined Grace Road Church and travelled to join the group in Fiji from all over the world. In an interview with the Guardian, one American teenager who was taken to Grace Road Church by her mother, told how she was trapped there, had her passport taken, her medication withheld and all contact with her father and sister in the US cut off. She eventually escaped by running out of the church and making a phone call from a convenience store. Grace Road Church still owns and operates multiple businesses across Fiji, including farms, cafes and construction companies. After the sentence was handed down, an opposition leader in Fiji called for an investigation into alleged links between the Fijian government and the cult, according to RNZ, saying that as a member of the UN Human Rights Council, the government should do more to investigate concerns about modern-day slavery in Fiji. Christian-inspired cults have mushroomed in South Korea where more than a quarter of the population are Protestants or Catholics. A cult leader who claimed to be the messiah was sentenced to 16 years in prison at an appeal court in May for raping multiple female followers.",

Federal editor and Canberra bureau chief Bevan Shields, who recently announced he was stepping down from his role in the press gallery, is a likely candidate for the London bureau, sources say. \u201cWe are advertising these roles now so the successful candidates have enough time to sort their visas and personal arrangements,\u201d national editor Tory McGuire told staff. \u201cThe successful applicant will have a proven track record of breaking news across a range of core newsroom topics, and the ability to quickly develop deep contacts and expertise in their assigned areas.\u201d Murdoch \u2018performance measures\u2019 Some of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s journalists were less than impressed with a memo that went out to all staff last week announcing they had to meet certain \u201cperformance measures\u201d for their jobs, but none of the measures mentioned anything about good journalism. The executive chairman of News Corp Australasia, Michael Miller, said a lot about goal setting and performance but nothing about breaking a story, they moaned. \u201cEvery day at News we put an enormous amount of human effort into the success of our business,\u201d Miller said. \u201cNever before has it been so important that this effort be aligned to achieving our strategy and delivering on our purpose of engaging more Australians and connecting more customers. \u201cAgree with your manager one to three \u2018performance measures\u2019,\u201d he said, listing revenue, efficiency targets, gross margin, new subscriptions and subscriber page views. The memo came in the wake of a controversial trial run by the Herald Sun, which offered journalists a financial bonus of between $10 and $50 for driving digital subscriptions and traffic through their own stories. The bonus scheme is already running at several local papers across the company. Staff will also be measured on their \u201calignment to the company values\u201d, Miller said, in what has to be described as an Orwellian development. News downsized? But it wasn\u2019t Miller\u2019s only problem with communication this week. Rupert Murdoch\u2019s main man in Australia announced on Twitter that News Corp\u2019s major newspapers \u201care all changing formats to a more compact, reader friendly size\u201d on 12 August. Wait, what? The Australian is now the only remaining broadsheet, after the Sydney Morning and the Age downsized to a compact in 2013. Is the Oz really giving up its proud status as the last broadsheet? Er, no, it was a misunderstanding, corporate affairs said. Miller has now deleted his errant tweet. The more prosaic news was that some regional News Corp newspapers, starting with the NT News, are changing their format from 405mm to 350mm. The editor of the NT News, Matt Williams, said the story count would be higher. \u201cNewspaper readers like lots of little stories \u2013 there will still be a lead and a picture story or a picture lead on a page and then lots of smaller briefs.\u201d The Centralian Advocate and the Sunday Territorian will also downsize later in the month. Wrong call on Crown ads Last week a series of 60 Minutes advertisements teased an investigation \u201cthat would rock the foundation of Australia\u201d. While the story may not quite have lived up to that hype \u2013 what story could have? \u2013 the Nine group\u2019s deep dive into Crown and the casino\u2019s alleged links to organised crime was nonetheless a huge story. Crown hit back midweek, trying to place large print ads picking apart the journalism of the program and the Nine newspapers. According to the Australian\u2019s Margin Call column, the Sydney Morning Herald, Age and Financial Review ran the ads denouncing their own journalism. But it was not so \u2013 in fact, the papers declined to run the ads, backed their journalists and in some cases printed a detailed rebuttal of the criticisms. The Australian has corrected the online version of the column.",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s my sad duty to inform you that the city of Sydney as we know it is set to be destroyed and replaced by the totalitarian spectre of a chilling dystopia. At least, that\u2019s if you believe the Daily Telegraph\u2019s latest reporting on the lord mayor Clover Moore\u2019s 2050 vision.</p> <p>Moore has outlined a concept for how the city could look that year as part of the City of Sydney council\u2019s broader move to make the city more sustainable.</p> <p>Given the spectre of rising sea levels in a harbour city that has already <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/environment/climate-change/city-of-sydney-officially-declares-climate-emergency-20190625-p520zd.html\">declared a climate emergency</a>, you would expect future planning to help mitigate the worst of these scenarios, if for no other reason than to help keep its spot on the most liveable city rankings. Instead, the Telegraph describes Moore\u2019s future Sydney as a \u201cwacky dystopian vision\u201d.</p> <p>The City of Sydney Liberal councillor Christine Forster is quoted in the piece criticising Moore for \u201cscaring children with alarmist rhetoric\u201d, citing a feedback session that described children as being deeply anxious. Won\u2019t someone think of the children? Not in a \u201chanding them a better world\u201d sense, of course, but at least coddle them until they inherit the worst of our sins.</p> <p>We really must figure out how to teach our children that their quality of life may be greatly reduced due to our inaction, but in a way that excites them. Perhaps Frozen 2 can be set in a steaming puddle or something.</p> <p>The Institute of Public Affairs, a thinktank partly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/21/gina-rinehart-company-revealed-as-45m-donor-to-climate-sceptic-thinktank\">funded by a mining giant</a> and consistent in their <a href=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2019/01/29/institute-of-public-affairs-climate-change-denialism/\">unscientific denialism</a>, are invited to pull up their diesel-fuelled clown car and spout off unchallenged, misleading statistics and claim the focus on climate change is \u201cnonsense\u201d.</p> <p>But, I\u2019m afraid to say, the Telegraph is entirely correct. Clover Moore is building a dystopian world, which we shall call Cloverfield, in which Fahrenheit 451 is just the expected low temperature on a weather report for a spring day.</p> <p>What is this dystopian \u201cradical climate agenda\u201d that has frightened the Telegraph much more than the benign fact of Greenland <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2019/08/01/greenland-ice-sheet-poured-billion-tons-water-into-north-atlantic-july-alone/?utm_term=.e96790c9434c\">rapidly melting away</a> before our eyes? Well, unlike the atmosphere itself, the future Sydney can only be described as chilling.</p> <p>The Telegraph reports the vision for Sydney includes cars \u201cbanished underground\u201d in a dramatic depiction of what some would call a tunnel. Renewables will power the city and single-use plastics will be banned. Will this ban be under pain of death? We can only assume yes.</p> <p>The poor, hapless residents will also be subjected to air conditioned \u201cpublic urban cool rooms\u201d, according to the report.</p> <p>This is pure Orwell. Who can forget the frightening moment in 1984 when poor Winston Smith is thrown into Room 101 only to be confronted by what he fears most: ducted air conditioning.</p> <p>Trains and light rail would be powered by renewable energy, urban farms would feed the city. On its face, this sounds like a great thing.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s my sad duty to inform you that the city of Sydney as we know it is set to be destroyed and replaced by the totalitarian spectre of a chilling dystopia. At least, that\u2019s if you believe the Daily Telegraph\u2019s latest reporting on the lord mayor Clover Moore\u2019s 2050 vision. Moore has outlined a concept for how the city could look that year as part of the City of Sydney council\u2019s broader move to make the city more sustainable. Given the spectre of rising sea levels in a harbour city that has already declared a climate emergency, you would expect future planning to help mitigate the worst of these scenarios, if for no other reason than to help keep its spot on the most liveable city rankings. Instead, the Telegraph describes Moore\u2019s future Sydney as a \u201cwacky dystopian vision\u201d. The City of Sydney Liberal councillor Christine Forster is quoted in the piece criticising Moore for \u201cscaring children with alarmist rhetoric\u201d, citing a feedback session that described children as being deeply anxious. Won\u2019t someone think of the children? Not in a \u201chanding them a better world\u201d sense, of course, but at least coddle them until they inherit the worst of our sins. We really must figure out how to teach our children that their quality of life may be greatly reduced due to our inaction, but in a way that excites them. Perhaps Frozen 2 can be set in a steaming puddle or something. The Institute of Public Affairs, a thinktank partly funded by a mining giant and consistent in their unscientific denialism, are invited to pull up their diesel-fuelled clown car and spout off unchallenged, misleading statistics and claim the focus on climate change is \u201cnonsense\u201d. But, I\u2019m afraid to say, the Telegraph is entirely correct. Clover Moore is building a dystopian world, which we shall call Cloverfield, in which Fahrenheit 451 is just the expected low temperature on a weather report for a spring day. What is this dystopian \u201cradical climate agenda\u201d that has frightened the Telegraph much more than the benign fact of Greenland rapidly melting away before our eyes? Well, unlike the atmosphere itself, the future Sydney can only be described as chilling. The Telegraph reports the vision for Sydney includes cars \u201cbanished underground\u201d in a dramatic depiction of what some would call a tunnel. Renewables will power the city and single-use plastics will be banned. Will this ban be under pain of death? We can only assume yes. The poor, hapless residents will also be subjected to air conditioned \u201cpublic urban cool rooms\u201d, according to the report. This is pure Orwell. Who can forget the frightening moment in 1984 when poor Winston Smith is thrown into Room 101 only to be confronted by what he fears most: ducted air conditioning. Trains and light rail would be powered by renewable energy, urban farms would feed the city. On its face, this sounds like a great thing. Climate change is already driving global hunger and a major, growing city investing in its food security seems to have no downside. But you have to understand dystopian double speak. Urban farms? That\u2019s clearly a thinly veiled guise for eating people. Moore may be an independent but this is a platform for the Soylent Greens. This is not a future we want. Sure, the government\u2019s own modelling predicts higher temperatures and more extreme weather events, yet this is no reason to be frightened or even plan for this scenario. Rather, we should simply keep stumm and politely melt into the concrete. \u2022 James Colley is a comedian and writer for Gruen, Tomorrow Tonight and The Weekly.

      "bodyText": "Australia might know her best as the pash-rashed netballer Sharon Strezlecki from Kath and Kim, but Magda Szubanski got to play a very different kind of role recently: an older woman, \u201cfierce and intense, warm and slightly wacky\u201d, for the video clip to Seeker Lover Keeper\u2019s single Let It Out. Staring powerfully down the camera, alone on a tiny stage, making dramatic, emphatic gestures, she lip-syncs to Holly Throsby\u2019s paper-delicate lyrics about speaking her truth. (\u201cHaving gone through the whole journey of coming out \u2026 I\u2019ve felt like a butterfly shaking off a carapace,\u201d Szubanski explained of her performance). Below the lead vocals, Sarah Blasko and Sally Seltmann\u2019s harmonies twine. At one point, Szubanski wipes off her high-glam makeup. \u201cMagda kept saying, \u2018I\u2019ve never done this before, I\u2019m loving my costume!\u2019 She just loved it,\u201d Throsby recalls with a laugh, sitting with her bandmates in a booth at Golden Age cinema and bar in Surry Hills, where they filmed the clip a few months ago. (\u201cShe kept saying she was \u2018loving herself sick\u2019,\u201d adds Blasko). \u201cAnd then we were watching one of the playbacks, like towards the end, and she said, \u2018Fucking hell, we\u2019ve made art.\u2019\u201d Throsby, Blasko and Seltmann emerged as three of the country\u2019s most beloved, developed and subtle songwriters with their critically acclaimed debut solo albums, which all arrived in the second half of 2004. A sort of holy trinity, they joke that they\u2019ve \u201call been compared to each other\u201d by music writers over the years and records since: \u201cYou sound like Sarah Blasko!\u201d Their supergoup Seeker Lover Keeper was born during a late night out after one of Seltmann\u2019s gigs. It spawned a self-titled record in 2011 and two national tours, and cemented a friendship between the three that also manifests in playdates with their young kids and impenetrable in-jokes about eggplants. As with the first album, the videos for each single on their new record \u2013 which is released next week \u2013 revolve around an Australian actor interpreting the song. But where the 2012 clips featured men (including fan-favourite Even Though I\u2019m A Woman, with Aden Young), the 2019 all star women: Szubanski, Yael Stone (Wild Seeds), and Madeleine Madden (Superstar). \u201cWe really wanted three people who had that strength of both of character and integrity, and who represented views that we are all aligned with,\u201d explains Throsby. Each actor was given a loose brief \u2013 to perform femininity \u2013 and the freedom to interpret it how they wanted. The idea to make another record came up almost accidentally while the three were chatting on-air on Double J in 2016, during Blasko\u2019s month-long hosting stint on the station. They began writing in earnest last year. \u201cWe do tend to pick up exactly where we left off,\u201d says Throsby \u2013 but Wild Seeds is a different proposition to their debut. That album was written turn by turn, with each handing off a song of their own to another member for interpretation. The result was beautiful, but felt more like a happy experiment in artistic compatibility than an album. This time, for the first time, they wrote together, arranged together, sang together. \u201cI think it\u2019s just more ... band-y.\u201d The songs have a warm, worn-in glow, the trio\u2019s crisp, luminous voices and pop sensibilities threaded together more cohesively. The lyrics return to similar themes: being who you are, not hiding any more, human connections built with love over time. \u201cWe wanted it to be quite an uplifting album,\u201d explains Throsby. \u201cEspecially with [the title track] Wild Seeds ... It\u2019s about looking back on youth \u2013 but it\u2019s also about looking at now and not thinking, \u2018Oh, this is shit now that I\u2019m getting older.\u2019\u201d During SLK\u2019s six-year break, all three women hit their 40s. All three admit that sailing out of one decade and into the next wasn\u2019t easy \u2013 and all three had a moment where they thought they might be done with music for good. Seltmann, living in LA at the time, discovered an insecurity about her career she hadn\u2019t foreseen. \u201cI was just about to turn 40 and I was having a real, like, \u2018Should I keep doing music? Can I do music as an \u201colder woman\u201d?\u2019 Getting really quite down about it.\u201d She \u201ccheered [herself] up\u201d by thinking about PJ Harvey and other idols who hadn\u2019t let ageism stop them, and dove back in, writing scores for TV series \u2013 including Netflix\u2019s The Letdown \u2013 as well as her own work. Throsby had that moment between albums: she wrote her first novel (the acclaimed Goodwood), had a daughter, and didn\u2019t want to make music at all. \u201cI was really at a loss with music stuff for a while there. Didn\u2019t really think I would continue doing it. But I think it was good to kind of almost make the decision not to do it. I wrote the book and then after that \u2026 You know, when the songs just kind of come to you in a really effortless way and it\u2019s really nice?\u201d They all remember it happening to Blasko too \u2013 on the first day of their writing session for Wild Seeds. \u201cYou were in a real like \u2018I don\u2019t know if I want to continue\u2019 [mood],\u201d Throsby recalls. Blasko, whose son turned four on the day of our interview, nods. \u201cI wrote a song about feeling like I was falling out of love with wanting to be a singer-songwriter; [about how] I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m meant to do it. That\u2019s the feeling I had. But then it always, always comes back.\u201d \u2022 Wild Seeds by Seeker Lover Keeper is out on Friday 9 August through Liberation.

      "bodyText": "As City of Gold opens, Breythe Black (played by the play\u2019s writer and star Meyne Wyatt) enters the stage to the sound of traditional Indigenous music, carrying spear and canoe \u2013 representing the idealised image of the noble savage Aboriginal man, its own racist trope. Only when a voice calls \u201ccut\u201d is it revealed to be a scene for the annual Australia Day lamb commercial \u2013 though this one adds a call to \u201cchange the date\u201d to its oversimplified and erroneous account of the meaning of the day. The indignity of the experience causes Breythe to walk off the set. As he does, he finds out his Dad (Maitland Schnaars) has died and he returns home to Kalgoorlie. This is the first play written by Kalgoorlie born actor Meyne Wyatt, who since graduating from NIDA in 2010 has worked across stage, screen and television including The Sapphires (2012), Redfern Now (2013), Neighbours (2014-2016) and Mystery Road (2018). City of Gold opened in Sydney\u2019s Griffin Theatre Company off the back of a season for co-producers Queensland Theatre. For the Wongutha-Yamatji writer, the play is unapologetically autobiographical, exploring the challenges of the limited and typecast roles for Aboriginal actors, and the inevitable pull of family and the world back home. The Kalgoorlie homecoming highlights the uneasy tensions but strong family bonds between Breythe, his sister Carina (Shari Sebbens), and his older brother Mateo (Mathew Cooper). Each in their own way grieve and feel the guilt of what they didn\u2019t do for their father, and each tries to navigate through the racial dynamics of a town where violence is close to the surface, and too often bubbles over. Their cousin, Cliffhanger (Jeremy Ambrum), has a hearing disability, making him the most vulnerable in the extended family and the community \u2013 and it is his treatment by the police that causes the ultimate crisis. Carina tries to be conciliatory lynchpin and only fight the battles she can win; Mateo is a barely contained retaliatory violence; Breythe has left the town and seems ready to flee again. Each rages, and each feels the frustrations of their impotency, as they struggle to change their situation amid the world\u2019s fundamental injustices. In death, his dad looms large for Breythe, and speaks to his uneasy place between his country and his attempts to navigate life in the city. In these moments, the storytelling lurches in to magic realism, evoking dreams, symbolism and inner turmoil. Sometimes jarring to audiences, it is an established attribute of Indigenous story that gives space to commune not just with the inner self, but with the spiritual and deep cultural realm. Breythe is forced to return to make the lamb commercial to raise the money for the funeral. In an ambitious scene that parodies the farcical, humiliating stereotypes \u2013 and the painful images that reflect the way the dominant culture characterises Aboriginal people \u2013 the real cost to Breythe\u2019s soul is profoundly felt. Within this simple story is a deep and stinging emotional heart. More than a \u201ccaught between two worlds\u201d story, it is one that looks at the personal humiliations of racism against a backdrop of the very human emotions of guilt, grief and anger. If writing the play was a form of healing after the death of his father, Wyatt also promotes a thesis that rage is its own form of catharsis. City of Gold is ambitious in its attempt to explore the harsh, overt and brutal racism in Kalgoorlie with the more politely masked but equally harmful racism of the city. There are bold choices, including a passionate soliloquy that speaks to the lived experience of Indigenous people and confronts the audience with uncomfortable truths. Nothing is more scary than an angry Aboriginal person, Wyatt taunts as his character rages, contorted with fury. It\u2019s a serious provocation to the audience \u2013 how can Australia \u201crecognise\u201d if it doesn\u2019t understand why Indigenous people might feel rage? How much is reconciliation just about making the colonial culture feel better about what it has done, rather than about making real change? How can a country aim for recognition and respect when racism is still systemic \u2013 and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people continue to die as a consequence? Wyatt offers no answers to these perennial questions. One suspects that\u2019s because his thesis is, as Carina says, \u201cThis is their mess \u2026 we\u2019ve been punished enough.\u201d Addressing the audience like this can easily turn into didactic lecturing, tinging a story with \u201cworthiness\u201d. But the rawness that Wyatt brings to his performance makes it so confessional, so personal, that one feels the emotion as much as the ideas. Wyatt\u2019s performance is matched by that of Sebbens, a dynamic actor who draws us deeply into Carina\u2019s world. Cooper, who could easily have been stuck on a single note of anger, draws nuance into his brooding portrayal of Mateo. The energy and power of these three roles pulls us through the moments that are more stilted and unpolished \u2013 so when City of Gold culminates in a final scene that is moving, devastating and tragically inevitable, the emotional punch lands. This is a credit to director Issac Drandic, who has managed to keep a play written by its lead actor from feeling self-indulgent. Drandic draws solid performances from the rest of the cast, brought together by the functional and evocative set by Simone Tesorieri and Simona Cosentini, and the lighting by Jason Glenwright that emanates a pressure-cooker heat.

And while much is made of anger as a theme, it seems the very act of crafting a story so personal \u2013 a story that asks a nation, \u201cIs this your best version of yourself?\u201d \u2013 is also an act of love. That\u2019s another tantalising aspect to City of Gold: a bold and exciting new voice in Australian playwriting has been discovered and unleashed. \u2022 Griffin Theatre Company\u2019s performance of City of Gold runs at Sydney\u2019s SBW Stables Theatre until 31 August",

      "bodyText": "The congresswoman Ilhan Omar took a swipe at Donald Trump on Thursday, posting a photo on Instagram of herself and Nancy Pelosi in Ghana with the caption: \u201cThey said \u2018send her back\u2019 but Speaker Pelosi didn\u2019t just make arrangement to send me back, she went back with me.\u201d The photo came from a congressional trip to the African country this week, in observance of the American slave trade\u2019s 400th anniversary. The two women were joined by the civil rights icon and Georgia congressman John Lewis and other members of the Congressional Black Caucus. Omar\u2019s comment followed Donald Trump\u2019s racist assertion that she and three other progressive lawmakers of color \u2013 representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib, who call themselves the Squad \u2013 should \u201cgo back and help fix the totally broken and crime-infested places from which they came\u201d despite the fact that they were all US citizens. Subsequently, Trump\u2019s supporters chanted \u201csend her back\u201d after Trump mentioned Omar at a rally in North Carolina. Pelosi, who has found herself at odds with the progressive members of the Squad in the past on issues such as impeachment, vigorously denounced Trump\u2019s behavior. The House of Representatives swiftly passed a resolution condemning the attack as racist. \u201cEvery single member of this institution, Democratic and Republican, should join us in condemning the president\u2019s racist tweets,\u201d Pelosi said on the House floor after the resolution was passed. In her address to the Ghanaian parliament on Wednesday, Pelosi said the delegation\u2019s visit to a fort where slaves had been held was a \u201ctransformative and humbling\u201d experience. Ghana\u2019s president, Nana Akufo-Addo, declared 2019 \u201cthe Year of Return\u201d \u2013 a commemoration that is meant to encourage people of African ancestry to make the \u201cbirthright journey home for the global African family\u201d. Omar posted several snapshots from the delegation\u2019s trip, thanking Akufo-Addo for hosting the delegation and committing to \u201cwork together to overcome global security and build a more sustainable world to combat climate crisis\u201d. In a statement, chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, Karen Bass, said it had been \u201ca profoundly significant trip\u201d, adding that it \u201csays a great deal about the historical ties between our countries and reaffirms our commitment to Ghana and to the continent of Africa\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>I remember a period in the 1990s when everything from Hollywood seemed to arrive in pairs. The genre of lava-spewing disaster movies was virtually non-existent until 1997, when Dante\u2019s Peak was released, followed quickly by Volcano. A mysterious array of doublets followed, including two Dalai Lama movies (Kundun and Tibet), two animated films about insects (Antz and A Bug\u2019s Life) and a couple of space-journeying end-of-the-world blockbusters (Armageddon and Deep Impact).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It speaks loudly and articulately, dropping the kind of truth bombs that smash your heart to pieces</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Australian film industry operates on a much smaller scale than Tinseltown, of course, but that\u2019s not to say we can\u2019t provide some double-ups every now and then. Take, for example, a pair of documentaries exploring the career of the great Australian footballer Adam Goodes: first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/30/the-final-quarter-review-exhilarating-adam-goodes-documentary-pulses-with-urgency\">The Final Quarter</a>, which premiered at Sydney film festival in June and recently aired on Channel 10; and now The Australian Dream, which played as the opening night film of this year\u2019s Melbourne International film festival.</p> <p>Any person of sane mind would acknowledge that Goodes, who was in effect booed out of the stadium and retired prematurely in 2015, was a victim of racism. One of the benefits of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jun/05/ayrton-senna-alain-prost\">Senna</a>-like approach undertaken in The Final Quarter, being entirely constructed from archival footage, was that it appeared to allow parties, such as Andrew Bolt and Eddie Maguire, to hang themselves with their own words. Just a few years down the track, it is already clear that history has condemned them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"64357ea4bb97525d52e303e0074295ac38c197d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64357ea4bb97525d52e303e0074295ac38c197d1/0_0_1920_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A still from the 2019 Australian documentary The Australian Dream, about AFL footballer Adam Goodes, written by Stan Grant.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Australian Dream is \u2018constantly making connections, always reaching for new ideas and expanding its hypothesis.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Madman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In The Australian Dream, both Bolt and Maguire receive a decent amount of screen time, appearing in interviews conducted for the film. In the case of Maguire this decision from the director, Daniel Gordon, almost works, given he says what might, at a push, be considered something vaguely approaching contrition. But in Bolt\u2019s case, the ideologically charged commentator has been handed yet another platform to dig his heels in, to double down, to once more present himself as a purveyor of truth, bravely going into battle against the bleeding hearts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/may/30/a-tale-of-two-adam-goodes-films-docos-on-afl-legend-put-racism-in-big-picture\">A tale of two Adam Goodes films: docos on AFL legend put racism in big picture</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At one point Bolt tells us, with a straight face, that when the crowd booed Goodes this was \u201ctheir contribution to the debate\u201d. These moments cheapen the film with \u201cinsights\u201d derived from baseless contrarianism. Maguire meanwhile confusingly suggests that his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/may/29/eddie-mcguire-adam-goodes-remarks\">infamous King Kong joke</a> was a result of being overworked; he appears to have mixed up his words, you see, when trying to make a point about black minstrel shows. Or something.</p> <p>Part of the scope of The Australian Dream is to rewrite and correct Australia\u2019s problematic history. In this context it is an unusual decision to give a podium to the kinds of people who have been in control of the narrative for so long.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"efd4f0b4d4a03853ae546a4b7c0f63dfd04489d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/efd4f0b4d4a03853ae546a4b7c0f63dfd04489d4/0_0_1920_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A still from the 2019 Australian documentary The Australian Dream, about AFL footballer Adam Goodes, written by Stan Grant.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018At one point Grant explains that the successes of his life have been achieved despite, rather than because of, the \u201cAustralian dream\u201d.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Madman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I would love to see a film exploring the highly interesting and dignified Goodes life story in detail. Instead Gordon, and writer Stan Grant, have more ambitious ideas in mind for The Australian Dream, indicated by the title and expressed visually through the film\u2019s first juxtaposition. Gordon cuts from an aerial view of sun-parched desert to the image of a footy stadium, its immaculate bright green grass illuminated in the night sky.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/30/the-final-quarter-review-exhilarating-adam-goodes-documentary-pulses-with-urgency\">The Final Quarter review \u2013 exhilarating Adam Goodes documentary pulses with urgency</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This transition argues that there is a deep connection between the recreational public ritual of sport and deeper things, such as our people and our land. Just a few minutes in, the film broaches the debate around Australia Day, and the country\u2019s infatuation with sport, as well as briefly looking at Goodes\u2019s formative years.

      "bodyText": "I remember a period in the 1990s when everything from Hollywood seemed to arrive in pairs. The genre of lava-spewing disaster movies was virtually non-existent until 1997, when Dante\u2019s Peak was released, followed quickly by Volcano. A mysterious array of doublets followed, including two Dalai Lama movies (Kundun and Tibet), two animated films about insects (Antz and A Bug\u2019s Life) and a couple of space-journeying end-of-the-world blockbusters (Armageddon and Deep Impact). The Australian film industry operates on a much smaller scale than Tinseltown, of course, but that\u2019s not to say we can\u2019t provide some double-ups every now and then. Take, for example, a pair of documentaries exploring the career of the great Australian footballer Adam Goodes: first The Final Quarter, which premiered at Sydney film festival in June and recently aired on Channel 10; and now The Australian Dream, which played as the opening night film of this year\u2019s Melbourne International film festival. Any person of sane mind would acknowledge that Goodes, who was in effect booed out of the stadium and retired prematurely in 2015, was a victim of racism. One of the benefits of the Senna-like approach undertaken in The Final Quarter, being entirely constructed from archival footage, was that it appeared to allow parties, such as Andrew Bolt and Eddie Maguire, to hang themselves with their own words. Just a few years down the track, it is already clear that history has condemned them. In The Australian Dream, both Bolt and Maguire receive a decent amount of screen time, appearing in interviews conducted for the film. In the case of Maguire this decision from the director, Daniel Gordon, almost works, given he says what might, at a push, be considered something vaguely approaching contrition. But in Bolt\u2019s case, the ideologically charged commentator has been handed yet another platform to dig his heels in, to double down, to once more present himself as a purveyor of truth, bravely going into battle against the bleeding hearts. At one point Bolt tells us, with a straight face, that when the crowd booed Goodes this was \u201ctheir contribution to the debate\u201d. These moments cheapen the film with \u201cinsights\u201d derived from baseless contrarianism. Maguire meanwhile confusingly suggests that his infamous King Kong joke was a result of being overworked; he appears to have mixed up his words, you see, when trying to make a point about black minstrel shows. Or something. Part of the scope of The Australian Dream is to rewrite and correct Australia\u2019s problematic history. In this context it is an unusual decision to give a podium to the kinds of people who have been in control of the narrative for so long. I would love to see a film exploring the highly interesting and dignified Goodes life story in detail. Instead Gordon, and writer Stan Grant, have more ambitious ideas in mind for The Australian Dream, indicated by the title and expressed visually through the film\u2019s first juxtaposition. Gordon cuts from an aerial view of sun-parched desert to the image of a footy stadium, its immaculate bright green grass illuminated in the night sky. This transition argues that there is a deep connection between the recreational public ritual of sport and deeper things, such as our people and our land. Just a few minutes in, the film broaches the debate around Australia Day, and the country\u2019s infatuation with sport, as well as briefly looking at Goodes\u2019s formative years. This is a documentary that\u2019s constantly making connections, always reaching for new ideas and expanding its hypothesis. This kind of ambition is sometimes to its own detriment, given there\u2019s material here for at least half a dozen movies and some of the meatier subjects are given short shrift. The pacing \u2013 in the first half especially \u2013 is brisk and inelegant, with many interview moments chopped up to the size of a single sound byte. Most of these interviews were filmed in front of generic pass\u00e9-looking grey backdrops, which reminded me of the kinds of daggy backgrounds sometimes used in professional family photographs. Grant\u2019s on-screen presence only really makes sense, from a structural point of view, towards the very end, when the title is explained through integration of his powerful 2016 speech about discrimination, colonisation, and, indeed, the \u201cAustralian dream\u201d. The director has a habit of cutting to the writer in order for him to explain (always eloquently) the meaning of the scene we just watched, which is a little on the nose. The Australian Dream tells rather than shows, going against the classic film-making dictum. But it speaks loudly and articulately, dropping the kind of truth bombs that smash your heart to pieces. At one point Grant explains that the successes of his life have been achieved despite, rather than because of, the \u201cAustralian dream\u201d. What an intensely sad hypothesis: that even a dream can be the realm of the privileged. The Final Quarter is, for me, a superior film, with a clearer purpose and a sharper style.

Or maybe that\u2019s self-justifying crap. Maybe it\u2019s just that alcohol is an addictive substance like all of those illicit drugs we demonise and, over the years, I had become addicted.</p> </blockquote> <p>The piece had an extraordinary response with hundreds of thousands of people reading. Below is an edited selection of readers\u2019 comments:</p> <h2><strong>\u2018The line between an alcoholic and normal drinker is blurred\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Good for you. As someone who did have a drink problem, I personally think the line between an alcoholic and a normal drinker is blurred. Millions of these supposed normal drinkers are addicted to alcohol \u2013 a foul-tasting drug that makes you behave badly and feel wretched. Don\u2019t drink again and don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re giving anything up: you\u2019re not.</p> <h2>\u2018The decision proved quite easy\u2019</h2> <p>When I came to work in the Middle East six years ago, I took a conscious decision that living in a country where alcohol was illegal and trying to hold down a pretty challenging job would mean my avoiding booze completely. Once taken, the decision proved quite easy \u2013 it was as simple as changing gears. I was quite surprised, however, to find that the chief effect was not physical as much as it was mental \u2013 the depression and violent outbursts which had haunted me for decades gradually ebbed away. It took a while to realise that alcohol had been the equivalent of the <a href=\"https://www.uexpress.com/tell-me-a-story/2001/4/29/sinbad-and-the-old-man-of\">Old Man of the Sea for most of my adult life</a>.</p> <h2>\u2018I don\u2019t need alcohol to unwind\u2019</h2> <p>Best wishes, Gay. I stopped drinking two and a half years ago and with the benefit of distance, I can now say these things are true:<br>1. Alcohol made me feel good only in that it satisfied the craving for alcohol. Now the craving is gone (give it three months) I don\u2019t need alcohol to unwind. In fact, I\u2019m much less wound.<br>2. Everything is better without alcohol, and I really do mean everything.</p> <p>By the way, the most I drank in a session was three drinks. Mainly it was one or two. And I drank four to five times a week. So pretty normal by most standards. And I was addicted. I can see that now.</p> <h2>\u2018I didn\u2019t have an addiction, just a habit\u2019</h2> <p>Like the writer, my one or two glasses of wine with the evening meal crept up to three or four and some days I drank half a bottle or even whole bottle of wine. For about a year I had a background worry that I was addicted. Then I decided I needed to lose weight, and to be successful this time, I would stop drinking alcohol completely. So one day I just stopped. And for three months drank no alcohol apart from one night at a dinner party. Pleased to discover it was easy, I felt a lot better, and I was more productive and positive. And I was also happy to discover that I did not have an addiction, it had just been a habit. I just had a three week holiday where I had one or two beers most days. Now I am back at work and alcohol-free again. Highly recommend it. May not be quite so easy if you do have an addiction issue, which I did not seem to have.</p> <h2>\u2018I just drank too much\u2019</h2> <p>I am not joking, I never had a drink problem, I just drank too much. I drink all the time, now it is alcohol free beer. I never keep count. What jolted me into my senses was the day I drank four bottles of red and was still functional. I realised how much I was drinking and just gave up. I have never missed it. I had one drink out of curiosity, it was a non event. Hence I am not sure the addictive aspect is universal, I was definitely addicted to smoking.</p> <h2>\u2018I drank every night\u2019</h2> <p>Gave up proper drinking two years ago. I had slowly developed a bad habit of drinking every night, sometimes half a bottle, sometimes a whole bottle. I thought feeling vaguely shit until lunchtime was normal. The first thing I noticed a few weeks in is how happy I felt all the time. Just content and relaxed. I realised this was my old normal, it was like going back to being a child. It\u2019s changed my life immeasurably for the better, I\u2019ve gotten right into exercise and my fitness levels are fantastic for my age. I found after about eight months I can have the occasional drink at weddings etc with no problem, it doesn\u2019t trigger me wanting to continue. I know this is not the case for everyone.</p> <h2>\u2018I can\u2019t do it\u2019</h2> <p>I have been trying to stop bingeing on booze for 30 years. Can\u2019t do it. I stay sober for a month \u2013 no worries \u2013 feel great. Then for any reason or no reason I get totally tanked for three days until I\u2019m so ill sometimes I end up in hospital. At 14 I started on Muscat Marsala and Milk. euw! I could easily blend in to Russia because vodka is awesome. My guilt hits me when I play guitar and sing in Church. I am a hypocrite.</p> <h2>\u2018I have a very solitary life\u2019</h2> <p>I\u2019m a rural Irish single person who hasn\u2019t had a drink for about fifteen years, and I must admit that it\u2019s led to me having a very solitary life, but I\u2019m almost never in trouble, and I used to always be. Well worth it.</p> <h2>\u2018I\u2019ve replaced alcohol with super fizzy water\u2019</h2> <p>A drink, even just one drink, gave me a burst of instant ambition, followed by a rather anticlimactic 9pm procrastination slump once the kids were in bed, consisting of watching dumb YouTube clips about how evil Trump is, or some dissatisfying Netflix crap, until I couldn\u2019t keep my eyes open and crawled into bed at 12.30.<br>Now I understand that what I craved was actually the mouth feel, more than the alcohol. I\u2019ve replaced alcohol with super fizzy water and everything is better. In fact since then I\u2019ve not only been offered an amazing new job but I\u2019ve also learned the first couple of pages of Brahms\u2019 Intermezzo opus 118 number 2 in A major (which you should all go and listen to Glenn Gould playing on YouTube because it is life alteringly beautiful).</p> <h2>\u2018Booze-free was joyless\u2019</h2> <p>I used to have a booze-free month every year. I stopped doing it because I had to accept that those months were invariably the most joyless, miserable, depressing, empty months of the year. I am not joking, but I realise this experience does not sit well with this newspaper\u2019s tireless and tedious crusade against alcohol.</p> <h2>\u2018I want every inch of my life\u2019</h2> <p>I\u2019ve avoided alcohol all my life. Meaning, I might have one glass of wine, or half a pint of beer, two or three times a year, in a particular situation. But that\u2019s it. The reason? I\u2019m mean on giving away bits of my life, my energy, my alertness, my \u201cbeing present\u201d, as this writer puts it, being fully aware.</p> <p>The way she describes here hangovers \u2013 to me, that reads like feeling a bit ill. Feeling a bit ill <em>every day</em>. Feeling a bit low, a bit slow, a bit headachy, a bit foggy. Every bloody <em>day</em>. Like feeling you\u2019re about to come down with a cold every day.</p> <p>To me, it\u2019s like giving up bits of your life, your consciousness, your aliveness, your alertness. If I didn\u2019t feel I had an interesting life, with things to do, then I suppose it would matter less if I wasted some of it semi-aware, through drink. But I do have an interesting life, in all sorts of ways, so many things in which to take interest and pleasure. Were I to be drunk, or even tipsy, or even hungover, I could absolutely not be fully engaged in the moment, take real pleasure, be absorbed, experience things properly. I need all my faculties, all my senses, all my emotional alertness, to really experience being alive.</p> <p>Well, that\u2019s me, whether that sounds wanky or not. I want every second. I want every inch of my life, all that I can have, fully known, fully experienced, none of it chucked away.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018I\u2019ve overdone grog for adventure\u2019</strong></h2> <p>That middle class drinking wine at home every night is completely pointless and utterly dull.</p> <p>I\u2019ve overdone the grog for the most part but it\u2019s been largely the adventure of frothies in pubs, meeting people, women, the odd argument. But it served a purpose, I couldn\u2019t ever imagine just quaffing wine at home as some daily ritual.</p>",

Were I to be drunk, or even tipsy, or even hungover, I could absolutely not be fully engaged in the moment, take real pleasure, be absorbed, experience things properly. I need all my faculties, all my senses, all my emotional alertness, to really experience being alive. Well, that\u2019s me, whether that sounds wanky or not. I want every second. I want every inch of my life, all that I can have, fully known, fully experienced, none of it chucked away. \u2018I\u2019ve overdone grog for adventure\u2019 That middle class drinking wine at home every night is completely pointless and utterly dull. I\u2019ve overdone the grog for the most part but it\u2019s been largely the adventure of frothies in pubs, meeting people, women, the odd argument. But it served a purpose, I couldn\u2019t ever imagine just quaffing wine at home as some daily ritual.",

      "bodyText": "As Trump carries on with his rally in North Carolina, we\u2019re going to wrap up the liveblog for today. Check The Guardian\u2019s homepage for updates. A majority of House Democrats now support impeaching Trump. The Pentagon is reviewing a $10 billion contract with Amazon after criticism from the president. Joe Biden is not displeased with his debate performance last night but is affronted that his opponents found fault with Barack Obama\u2019s presidency instead of directing more fire at the Republicans. Nancy Pelosi refers to Jared Kushner as a \u201cslumlord\u201d, in the context of the president\u2019s damnation of Baltimore and Elijah Cummings this week. Trump threatened further tariffs on China in September. A budget deal is headed to Trump\u2019s desk, after passing the Senate. Congressman Will Hurd of Texas, a critic of Trump and one of the few Republican lawmakers who voted to condemn Trump\u2019s racist attacks, announced that he will not be seeking reelection in order to \u201cpursue opportunities outside the halls of Congress\u201d. Hurd is the third by a Texas Republican in the past week to announce retirement, following in the footsteps of representatives Mike Conaway and Pete Olson. Trump\u2019s rally in Cinncinati, Ohio is now underway. His supporters have yet to revive the \u201csend her back\u201d chants from the president\u2019s previous rally in North Carolina, aimed at progressive women lawmakers. A mention of Trump\u2019s 2016 rival Hillary Clinton, however, did incite chants to \u201clock her up\u201d. State prosecutors in Manhattan have subpoenaed Trump\u2019s family business, reviving an investigation into his role in hush-money payments made to Stormy Daniels during the 2016 presidential campaign, The New York Times is reporting. The subpoena, issued by the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office, demanded the Trump Organization provide documents related to money that had been used to buy the silence of Stormy Daniels, a pornographic film actress who said she had an affair with Mr. Trump. The inquiry from the district attorney\u2019s office, which is in early stages, is examining whether any senior executives at the company filed false business records about the hush money, which would be a state crime, the people said. Marc L. Mukasey, an attorney for the Trump Organization, called the inquiry a \u201cpolitical hit job\u201d ... The investigation will focus on a $130,000 payment Michael D. Cohen, the president\u2019s lawyer and fixer at the time, gave Ms. Daniels. Mr. Cohen also helped arrange for a tabloid media company to pay the Playboy model Karen McDougal, a second woman who said she had had an affair with the president. The disclosure of the payments ignited a scandal that threatened to derail the Trump presidency. The Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office on Thursday separately subpoenaed the media company, American Media Inc., the publisher of the National Enquirer. The Guardian has not independently verified the reporting. The subpoenas come just two weeks after federal investigators announced they had concluded their inquiry into the hush-money payments, without charging anyone but Cohen. A majority of House Democrats are now calling for impeachment. Nancy Pelosi is expected to make a statement later today on impeachment, though it\u2019s unclear whether her position on the matter has changed. Representative Pete Aguilar of California is the latest member of Congress to express support for opening an impeachment inquiry. The Trump administration is extending protections for about 7,000 Syrians in the US: From the Associated Press: The Trump administration is extending protections that allow about 7,000 Syrians to live and work legally in the U.S. The decision by acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan was announced Thursday and extends temporary protected status for 18 months for those who have been in the U.S. since Aug. 1, 2016. Temporary protected status is granted to countries ravaged by natural disasters or war and lets citizens of those countries remain in the U.S. until the situation improves back home. About 300,000 people have received those protections. McAleenan says the continued armed conflict in Syria merited the extension. Trump administration officials had moved to discontinue protections for many countries; several lawsuits have been filed. A judge ruled protections for people from Sudan, Nicaragua, Haiti and El Salvador cannot be immediately ended. As Trump equivocates over his supporters\u2019 racist chanting ahead of his rally in Ohio, representative Ilhan Omar \u2013 the target of those chants \u2013 joked, \u201cThey said \u2018send her back\u2019 but [Speaker Nancy Pelosi] didn\u2019t just make arrangements to send me back, she went back with me.\u201d A congressional delegation including Pelosi, Omar and civil rights icon John Lewis was in Ghana to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the first enslaved Africans arriving in the US. Yesterday, The AP reported that Pelosi found the visit to be \u201chumbling\u201d: The visit by Pelosi\u2019s delegation marks Ghana\u2019s Year of the Return, which reaches out to the millions of Africans in the diaspora. \u201cIt is important that this symbolic year, 400 years later, we commemorate their existence and their sacrifices,\u201d Ghana\u2019s President Nana Akufo-Addo said. Pelosi called the Year of the Return a \u201cbeautiful gesture\u201d that also recognizes a \u201cterrible atrocity\u201d in slavery. She said she and others had been transformed by this week\u2019s visit. It\u2019s been a busy day so far and there\u2019s plenty more action to come, as Donald Trump heads to Ohio for a rally in Cincinnati. And the Democratic 2020 candidates try to capitalize on the attention resulting from the debates this week, whether positive or negative attention (no such thing as bad publicity and all that). Guardian east coast team now handing over to Maanvi Singh in California. Here\u2019s what today has brought so far: The Pentagon is reviewing a $10bn contract with Amazon after criticism from the president. Trump is equivocating over the prospect of a repeat of the racist chanting that marked his last rally (without mentioning that if he chooses not to pick another fight with Ilhan Omar from the stage then there won\u2019t be a spur for a repeat of the \u201csend her back\u201d chanting anyway...) Joe Biden is not displeased with his debate performance last night but is affronted that his opponents found fault with Barack Obama\u2019s presidency instead of directing more fire at the Republicans. Nancy Pelosi refers to Jared Kushner as a \u201cslumlord\u201d, in the context of the president\u2019s damnation of Baltimore and Elijah Cummings this week. Trump threatened further tariffs on China in September Trump\u2019s new defense secretary, Mark Esper, is reviewing a $10bn cloud computing contract after the president suggested the Pentagon\u2019s selection process was rigged in favor of Amazon. Trump has frequently attacked the retail giant and its CEO Jeff Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post. The president has repeatedly dismissed the newspaper\u2019s reporting by calling it \u201cthe Amazon Washington Post\u201d. Politico reports: Esper, who assumed his post July 23, is now reviewing accusations of unfairness in the fiercely fought competition, the Pentagon announced Thursday, marking the president\u2019s latest incursion into the arcane world of Defense Department contracting. Oracle has reportedly waged an aggressive lobbying campaign to push back on the competition, including talking with members of Congress and preparing a graphic that made its way to the president\u2019s desk. Trump also raised doubts about whether he would be able to \u201cstop\u201d his supporters if they started a racist chant tonight. \u201cIf they do the chant, we\u2019ll have to see what happens,\u201d the president said, according to an NBC News reporter. \u201cI don\u2019t know that you can stop people.\u201d So stay tuned to see if the \u201csend her back\u201d chant makes an ugly return tonight. As Trump heads to Cincinnati for a campaign rally, he made a minor request of the attendees: don\u2019t initiate racist chants. Trump was asked as he prepared to leave for Ohio what he would do if another \u201csend her back\u201d started. \u201cI prefer that they don\u2019t,\u201d Trump said. The chant at his North Carolina rally was directed at Ilhan Omar, the Somali-American congresswoman who Trump previously suggested should \u201cgo back\u201d to where she came from. Despite outcry over the racist rhetoric, Trump praised the rally attendees as \u201cincredible patriots\u201d. Cory Booker\u2019s campaign said the New Jersey senator has seen his biggest online fundraising day since his debate performance last night. From Booker\u2019s campaign manager: Booker had already made the cut for the fall debate, receiving contributions from at least 130,000 donors and registering at 2% or more in four polls. But Booker has been generally unable to break past 2 or 3% in most polls. If this post-debate bump materializes in his polling numbers, it could help push him into the race\u2019s top tier of candidates. Trump is en route to Cincinnati, Ohio, where he will hold a campaign rally tonight at 7pm EDT. The rally will be Trump\u2019s first since some of his supporters initiated a racist \u201csend her back\u201d chant about the representative Ilhan Omar at a North Carolina event. The chant came days after Trump tweeted that four minority congresswomen, including Omar, should \u201cgo back\u201d to where they came from. So all eyes will be on the Ohio crowd to see if they mirror the behavior of the North Carolina rally attendees, who Trump praised as \u201cincredible patriots\u201d. But the vice-president, Mike Pence, said that, if the chant were to occur again, Trump \u201cmight\u201d try to intervene. \u201cIf it happened again, he might make an effort to speak out about it,\u201d Pence said recently. Kamala Harris has also stuck around Detroit after last night\u2019s debate, and the California senator said she had issues with the event\u2019s format. \u201cSo many of these issues just cannot be captured in 60 seconds,\u201d Harris said. Candidates in this week\u2019s debates were given 60 seconds to answer moderator-directed questions and 30 seconds for responses or rebuttals. The CNN moderators\u2019 received some criticism, particularly after the first night, for adhering strictly to the time limits for candidates\u2019 answers. It seemed to stifle the debate among the candidates, who were repeatedly cut off mid-point. After passing the budget deal, the Senate has joined the House in adjourning for Congress\u2019 summer recess. No votes will be held in either chamber until Sept. 9. Joe Biden has launched a counter-attack against critics of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, insisting his former boss has nothing \u201cto apologise for\u201d. Although opinion polls suggest that Obama remains the most popular Democratic politician in the country, his record on health care, immigration and other issues came under harsh scrutiny during last night\u2019s debate. \u201cI must tell you I was a little surprised at how much incoming there was about Barack, about the president,\u201d Biden said during a campaign stop in Detroit today. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m proud of having served with him, I\u2019m proud of the job he did. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything he has to apologize for and I think it kind of surprised me, the degree of the criticism.\u201d After spending more than an hour with customers and supporters at the Detroit One Coney Island Restaurant, where he was met with a cheer, Biden told reporters: \u201cI hope the next debate we can talk about how we fix the things that Trump has broken, not how Barack Obama made all these mistakes. He didn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t.\u201d Asked what he would do differently from his former boss on immigration policy, the 76-year-old former senator replied: \u201cLook, this is three years later, the world has changed, President Trump has turned it upside down internationally, he has turned it upside down economically. ... We have to be honest, straightforward and authentic about what we\u2019re going to do and I\u2019m looking forward to being able to go into some detail and explain and deal with the differences we have.\u201d The Affordable Care Act has had few defenders in the current campaign as candidates focus attention on variations of Medicare for all. But Biden insisted: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing moderate about what Barack did in Obamacare. Nothing. No president had come close, and they tried and they tried and they tried. Seven presidents. This guy did an incredible thing.\u201d Biden, who had a rocky first debate in Miami, expressed satisfaction with his performance this time around. He said: \u201cThis is a marathon. I feel good. We\u2019ve passed the quarter mark and I\u2019m feeling good.\u201d Nancy Pelosi defended representative Elijah Cummings, the House oversight chairman who was has recently been attacked by Trump. The president also went after Cummings\u2019 Baltimore district as a \u201crat and rodent infested mess.\u201d \u201cThe president \u2013 this comes as no surprise \u2013 really doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about,\u201d Prelosi said. She then took aim at Trump\u2019s adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner. \u201cBut maybe you could ask his son-in-law, who\u2019s a slumlord there, if he wants to talk about rodent infestations,\u201d Pelosi said. The Washington Post reported earlier this week that Kushner\u2019s company owns more than a dozen apartment complexes in Baltimore, and they have been cited for hundreds of code violations -- including for mouse infestations. Nancy Pelosi told reporters on Capitol Hill that she would release a statement later today on launching an impeachment inquiry. Congressional reporters shouted questions to the House speaker about whether her position on impeachment has changed now that a majority of her caucus backs an inquiry. Representative Ted Deutch of Florida announced his support of launching impeachment proceedings today, becoming the 118th House Democrat to do so, according to Politico. His endorsement means a majority of the 235-member caucus now back an inquiry. Joe Biden is still in Detroit after last night\u2019s debate, and he provided more context on that rumble jumble of numbers he provided in his closing statement. As he was delivering his final pitch last night, Biden said, \u201cIf you agree with me, go to \u2018Joe 30330\u2019 and help me in this fight.\u201d The odd request led some to wonder if the former vice president was announcing his White House bid for the next millennium. But it turns out he meant to say \u201ctext,\u201d as he explained to a CBS News reporter: Trump\u2019s tariff announcement also comes one day after the Federal Reserve announced that it was cutting interest rates to reflect the slowing growth of the US economy. From a CNBC reporter: Trump reportedly met with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer this morning. The pair were in Shanghai this week for trade talks with Chinese officials. Trump\u2019s tariff announcement came just hours after the meeting. In practical terms, Trump\u2019s new tariffs mean many products could soon become more expensive, as a Washington Post reporter noted: In political terms, Trump is acknowledging that all of the progress his administration was allegedly making with Beijing was never realized, as a CNN reporter explained: Stock markets had a swift, negative reaction to Donald Trump\u2019s announcement that his administration would impose a 10 percent tariff on $300 billion of Chinese goods starting next month: Trump has consistently bragged about the success of stock markets during his presidency. But his trade threats have repeatedly upended that success, damaging a key talking point for his reelection bid. Donald Trump announced over Twitter that his administration\u2019s trade talks with China have been deteriorating. As negotiations continue, Trump said he would impose a 10 percent tariff on the remaining $300 billion worth of Chinese imports starting Sept. 1. Joe Biden\u2019s campaign clarified his stance on fossil fuels after the former vice president got into a heated back-and-forth last night with Jay Inslee, who has centered his campaign around the climate crisis. Inslee argued that Biden\u2019s plan did not address the climate crisis with the urgency required to try to turn the tide. \u201cLook these deadlines are set by science,\u201d Inslee told Biden. \u201cMr Vice President, your argument is not with me, it\u2019s with science. And unfortunately your plan is just too late.\u201d When Biden was pressed on whether there would be a place for fossil fuels in his administration, he initially stumbled. \u201cWe will work it out,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will make sure it\u2019s eliminated and no more subsidies for either of those, any fossil fuels.\u201d His campaign has now clarified that answer, per our climate reporter Emily Holden: Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee released its logo for the 2020 nominating convention in Charlotte: And it prompted some questions, like this one: But the Republican Party is facing some larger problems in Charlotte -- namely that many in the North Carolina city don\u2019t want the convention to be hosted there. Charlotte\u2019s city council narrowly approved the RNC contract last summer, and local leaders are now having second thoughts on it, as HuffPost reports. The council even discussed the possibility last week of backing out of the agreement, but it was determined that the legal costs associated with such a move would be too steep. The budget bill does lift the debt ceiling into July 2021, but it does not necessarily prevent a government shutdown, as a CQ Roll Call reporter noted: Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, who opposed the budget deal, introduced an amendment earlier today to cut and cap spending while introducing a constitutional amendment to balance the budget over the next decade. The amendment was easily defeated, with only 23 Republicans backing the proposal. \u201cToday is the final nail in the coffin. The Tea Party is no more,\u201d Paul said of the deal\u2019s approval. The Republicans who opposed the budget deal argued that the legislation would put the US on an increasingly unstable fiscal path, as Senator Mitt Romney of Utah explained in a Twitter video: But Mitch McConnell told the dissenting members of his caucus that they should defer to the president\u2019s support of the deal. \u201cThis is the agreement the administration has negotiated,\u201d the Senate majority leader said on the floor this morning. \u201cThis is the deal the House has passed. This is the deal President Trump is waiting [for] and eager to sign into law. This is the deal that every member of this body should support when we vote later this morning.\u201d The Senate passed the massive spending bill negotiated between Nancy Pelosi and Steven Mnuchin by a vote of 67-28. The bill, which would lift the debt ceiling until 2021 and increase spending by $320 billion over two years, is now headed to Donald Trump\u2019s desk. A narrow majority of Senate Republicans backed the bill, thanks to lobbying from majority leader Mitch McConnell. Trump had pushed more Republicans to support the legislation after about two-thirds of House Republicans voted against it. In an effort to sway more Republicans, Trump ominously suggested he may roll back the spending increases sooner rather than later: This is Joanie Greve, taking over for Adam Gabbatt. Here is where the day stands so far: Donald Trump initiated a phone call with Vladimir Putin yesterday to offer \u201chelp and assistance\u201d in combating Siberia\u2019s wildfires. Or at least that was what the Kremlin reported over Twitter. The White House initially would not even confirm the call had taken place. Kelly Knight Craft was confirmed as the next US ambassador to the United Nations, overcoming Democrats\u2019 objections about her family\u2019s ties to the fossil fuel industry. More analysis continues to roll in from this week\u2019s Democratic debates. But for many candidates, it might have been their last debate. Only seven candidates so far have qualified for the September debate. The blog is also covering the budget deal headed to Trump\u2019s desk and the climbing number of Democrats calling for an impeachment inquiry. Stay tuned. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has just retweeted this, from meteorologist Eric Holthaus. It\u2019s not good news. At Rolling Stone, Holthaus writes: The record-setting heat wave that sweltered northern Europe last week has moved north over the critically vulnerable Greenland ice sheet, triggering temperatures this week that are as much as 25 to 30 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal. Weather models indicate Tuesday\u2019s temperature may have surpassed 75 degrees Fahrenheit in some regions of Greenland, and a weather balloon launched near the capital Nuuk measured all-time record warmth just above the surface. That heat wave is still intensifying, and is expected to peak on Thursday with the biggest single-day melt ever recorded in Greenland. On August 1 alone, more than 12 billion tons of water will permanently melt away from the ice sheet and find its way down to the ocean, irreversibly raising sea levels globally. Donald Trump is relying on lots of Democratic votes to pass his budget deal in the Senate, with many Republicans opposed to the amount of borrowing, according to Associated Press. The bill passed in the House last week, and is up for a vote in the Senate today. From AP: Democrats in the GOP-controlled Senate appeared poised to deliver most of their votes for the deal, but many of the more solidly conservative Republicans said it allowed for unchecked borrowing and too much spending. According to libertarian-ish senator Rand Paul, the passing of this budget will mean \u201cthe tea party is no more\u201d, which I can\u2019t imagine will upset too many people: \u201cAdoption of this deal marks the death of the tea party movement in America. Fiscal conservatives those who remain should be in mourning for Congress. Both parties have deserted you.\u201d Only seven candidates have qualified for the next Democratic debates, according to the New York Times. They are: Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Beto O\u2019Rourke. That\u2019s less than a third of the 24 \u2018major\u2019 Democrats in the field. To qualify, Democrats need 130,000 individual donors, and to have broken 2% in at least four polls. Apparently three others are close: Julian Castro, Andrew Yang and Amy Klobuchar, but that would still mean ABC cutting the debate schedule to one night. (There\u2019ll just be one debate if 10 or fewer candidates qualify.) Of the 14 Democrats not mentioned above: Only three candidates have even a single qualifying poll to their name: the impeachment activist Tom Steyer (2 polls), Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii (1) and former Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado (1). August 28 is the cut off point for Dems to achieve the qualification quota. Here he is: And another! Kamala Harris has picked up an endorsement this morning, from Michigan congresswoman Brenda Lawrence. Harris attended an event held by Lawrence, whose district includes much of east Detroit. That\u2019s handy, I guess, given Michigan\u2019s importance in the presidential election, although Michigan is one of the later states to vote in the actual Democratic primaries. Earlier this morning Julian Castro was endorsed by the Latino Victory Fund, a group which aims to build Latino political power. According to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s endorsement tracker, Harris is second to only Joe Biden in endorsements from governors, senators, representatives and suchlike. Interestingly, Cory Booker is third, making up a podium of centrists. Pompeo criticizes China after meeting Secretary of state Mike Pompeo earlier today criticized China\u2019s actions in Asia, after meeting his Chinese counterpart for the first time this year amid political tension between the two countries. He spoke out against Chinese \u201ccoercion\u201d of southeast Asian neighbors in disputes over the South China Sea and the People\u2019s Republic\u2019s dam-building on the Mekong River, which causes problems for countries down-river. Pompeo spoke at a meeting in Bangkok, Thailand, of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Reuters reports. After meeting China\u2019s top diplomat, Wang Yi, Pompeo said both countries wanted to improve ties that have soured on issues ranging from trade, US sanctions on Chinese telecoms giant Huawei, issues over Taiwan and the busy South China Sea waterway. \u201cWe are working with them on many fronts,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cBut we are also very candid about the places we are hoping China will behave in ways that they are not behaving today and we talked about each of those as well.\u201d Donald Trump has congratulated this morning Kelly Knight Craft after her confirmation by the Senate, over Democrats\u2019 objections, to become the new US ambassador to the United Nations. The President praised her on Twitter this morning. Craft was nominated in February, a week after Trump\u2019s first choice to replace Nikki Haley at the UN, the former Fox News host and state department spokeswoman Heather Nauert, withdrew her candidacy. During the congressional confirmation process, Craft struggled to allay Democrats\u2019 concerns about her family\u2019s significant investments in the fossil fuel industry, though notably she separated herself from the president on the topic of the climate crisis. Craft believes fossil fuels and human behavior contribute to the crisis. The planet is facing critical issues such as dangerous global heating, now, an alarming increase in severe weather patterns. On climate change, \u201cLet there be no doubt,\u201d she said, as reported yesterday by the Washington Post. White House on the call with Putin Don\u2019t hold your breath, here\u2019s the latest statement from the White House: President Donald J. Trump spoke with President Vladimir Putin today and expressed concern over the vast wildfires afflicting Siberia. The leaders also discussed trade between the two countries.\u201d Some on the interwebs see this as a strong overture/naked appeal for fully restored bilateral relations between the US and Russia. Candidates look fresh as daisies Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado and Senator Kamala Harris of California all appeared on CNN\u2019s New Day breakfast news program this morning shortly after the 7AM mark, after what must have been very little sleep. Maybe that\u2019s not so surprising but what was astonishing was how refreshed they looked. Not even a tiny snack bag under the eye, not a hair out of place, eyes twinkling. TV make-up can only cover so much. Gillibrand walked up on to the little CNN TV stage, which they\u2019ve set up in a half-indoors, half-outdoors style outside the debate venue in Detroit, with a large cup of coffee but looking utterly impeccable in a blue dress and with sharp answers. And Harris and Bennet were laughing. Of course they all denied it was a cage fight/Hunger Games contest the night before, that the first 20 minutes was lost in a wonk forest on healthcare and they ate each other, not the Republicans. But you\u2019ve got to hand it to these three for their energy. When the CNN hosts asked Harris how she was coping on no sleep, she cheerily cited the Godfather and said it was \u201cthe business we\u2019ve chosen.\u201d For all the amazing analysis of last night\u2019s event, check out my colleagues\u2019 stories leading our US online front page today. Here\u2019s our Sabrina Siddiqui\u2019s main story. I honestly can\u2019t promise that this pic matches Harris\u2019s quote. But here\u2019s the inimitable Marlon Brando, and it\u2019s The Godfather, so. \u2022Donald Trump initiated a call with Vladimir Putin on Wednesday, the Kremlin says, in a move Putin hopes will restore \u201cfully fledged bilateral relations\u201d. The White House did not initially reveal the call had taken place \u2013 news instead coming from the Russian foreign ministry\u2019s Twitter feed. Russia said Trump had offered \u201chelp and assistance\u201d in fighting wildfires in Siberia. The White House belatedly confirmed the call on Wednesday night. \u2022The main Democratic candidates are cooling themselves off (probably) after last night\u2019s debate. Some (Joe Biden) will be happy they don\u2019t have to do this again for five weeks, while the likes of Cory Booker, who put in a good performance, probably wish they could go again sooner. Many of the contenders we\u2019ve seen over the last two nights won\u2019t be debating again at all, given the stricter requirements for the 12 September debate. Fewer than half the main contenders have qualified so far. \u2022The Guardian\u2019s panelists were largely unimpressed with the debate spectacle. Joe Biden was ailing on climate change, Kate Aronoff reckoned, while Jessa Crispin lamented that the stage was made up of: \u201cLackluster candidates all around.\u201d Our man David Smith says the Democratic party is yet to find the one, which \u201cwill suit Donald Trump just fine\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "When news broke that senior officials in China were saying 90% of Uighurs detained in Xinjiang\u2019s notorious detention centres had been released, Nurgul Sawut\u2019s phone started going crazy. \u201cMy Whatsapp, my Signal, my Facebook, everyone was tagging me in their posts,\u201d said Sawut, a Uighur community leader based in Canberra. \u201cEveryone started reacting. They were saying: \u2018If 90%, where are my relatives, where are my family and friends?\u2019 We\u2019re not seeing any of those people in the community, who are you releasing?\u201d The statement on Wednesday came during a briefing by senior officials in the far-western region of Xinjiang, home to the Uighur ethnic minority group, who have been detained in huge numbers in detention facilities over the last few years. China continues to insist that the centres, which are believed to hold at least one million people, are vocational training facilities and has conducted a propaganda blitz about them, taking journalists on tours and releasing upbeat videos showing inmates in lessons, participating in cultural activities and working in factory jobs. At a briefing, Alken Tuniaz, vice-chairman of the Xinjiang government, said \u201cmost\u201d detainees of the internment camps had been released, though he refused to say exactly how many had been incarcerated, saying the situation was \u201cfluid\u201d as people \u201ccome and go\u201d. Shohrat Zakir, chairman of the regional government, said about 90% of the people who had been released from the centres had gone on to find suitable jobs and were earning \u201cconsiderable money\u201d. The reaction to the briefing from the Uighur diaspora community, including the roughly 3,000 in Australia,was immediate and angry. Most Uighur-Australians, says Sawut, are missing at least one family member and live in fear that their entire family will be taken. \u201cThis is like a grief,\u201d said Sawut, who has roughly 50 relatives whom she believes are detained in camps in Xinjiang. \u201cEveryone is so anxious, [wondering] what will come next. Boom, this came up for our community and it\u2019s like a kick in the guts. It made us angry, upset.\u201d People started sharing pictures on social media of their loved ones, who were still missing, with the hashtag: \u201cProveThe90\u201d. Fatimah Abdulghafur, a Uighur based in Sydney who has not had contact with her entire family for over a year and believes that at least her brother and father are in the camps, saw the news on Facebook where the reaction was overwhelming. \u201cEverybody was responding very negatively, they were all commenting on Facebook, sending each other messages, saying \u2018This isn\u2019t true, if it\u2019s true where is my person? My father is still missing, my friend is still missing.\u2019\u201d Arslan Mijit Hidayat, an Australian Uighur living in Istanbul, who lost contact with his father-in-law, the prominent Uighur comedian, Adil Mijit, last November, said he thought the news couldn\u2019t be true. \u201cI thought: it\u2019s a lie. I still think it\u2019s a lie. It means that nine out of 10 people have been released, and from talking to people, my close friends, none of their family members have been released.\u201d However, he says, that China might simply be fast and loose with their definition of \u201creleased\u201d. \u201cWhat did [Zakir] say? That they had gained employment. What is their definition of \u2018gainful employment\u2019?\u2026 So there could be some truth to the 90% \u2013 moved out of concentration camps into labour camps or factories where they are working for next to nothing or working to survive.\u201d \u201cEven if they have been really released and are at home, what kind of situation are they in? Are they under 24 hour surveillance? Until my father-in-law gets his passport back and can leave and come to live with us in Turkey, I don\u2019t consider that he could be free.\u201d",
