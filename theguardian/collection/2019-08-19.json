      "bodyText": "The husband of a British-Iranian woman being held in Tehran has castigated Boris Johnson for failing to meet the family since taking office, as it emerged that she faces harsh new conditions in prison. The prime minister has yet to arrange a meeting, despite insisting he felt a \u201cdeep sense of anguish\u201d over Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s case while campaigning for election to No 10. Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, criticised Johnson on Monday, after it emerged that tough new rules had been imposed on his wife and her fellow inmates in the notorious Evin prison. Zaghari-Ratcliffe is no longer allowed to call her husband in the UK and has been told she can see her young daughter Gabriella only once a month, rather than every few days. \u201cIt is the job of the government to protect people; particularly when the prime minister promised to leave no stone unturned,\u201d Ratcliffe said. \u201cIt remains the case that, since he took office, we have not met with him [and have] not been invited to meet with him or the foreign secretary.

I feel like I could suffocate. I can\u2019t even think what to do. I haven\u2019t cried so loud in the middle of the ward for ages. How cruel they are. How unjust this is.\u201d Johnson has faced heavy criticism over Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s case after erroneously suggesting in November 2017, while he was serving as the foreign secretary, that she had been in Iran teaching journalism. She and her family have always maintained she was on holiday visiting her family. Johnson later corrected his error, but it was cited as evidence against her. On Monday Ratcliffe said he was particularly worried about the effect on his wife\u2019s mental health of prison officials\u2019 decision to severely limit the frequency of visits to inmates. Zaghari-Ratcliffe has suffered from such issues during her incarceration and her relatives\u2019 initial hopes that she would receive proper medical care when she was allowed a move to a mental health ward last month were dashed when she was handcuffed to a bed and held in solitary confinement. Ratcliffe also criticised the British Council after it emerged on Monday that an appeal by one of its employees against a 10-year jail sentence imposed by Tehran in May had been rejected. Aras Amiri, an Iranian who has permanent resident status in Britain, was arrested and accused of spying for the UK while she was visiting a sick relative in Iran last year. She reportedly sent a letter to the head of the Iranian judiciary saying she was imprisoned because of her employment by the British Council, which promotes international cultural relations. \u201cThe interrogations were entirely focused on this matter and the case investigators noted that the problem was not me, but BC, which Iran wanted to stop operating in the country,\u201d she wrote, according to the Times. Ratcliffe called on the organisation to do more to protect its employees. Sir Ciar\u00e1n Devane, its chief executive, said: \u201cFurther to reports, we would like to express our deep disappointment and dismay that our colleague Aras Amiri has had her appeal against her 10-year sentence rejected by the Iranian authorities.

The men are three of 15 plaintiffs and two not-for-profit groups alleging \u201chorrific conditions\u201d and \u201ctorture\u201d in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention centers in a new class-action lawsuit on behalf of 55,000 detainees. The plaintiffs, who live with conditions ranging from cerebral palsy and bipolar disorder to blindness and schizophrenia, accuse the US government of denying jailed migrants food, medicine, surgeries and the most basic accommodations for disabilities. The suit filed in Los Angeles on Monday outlines individual experiences at eight different facilities, but immigration lawyers say the mistreatment is representative of systemic problems that affect tens of thousands of people. The complaint comes as the Trump administration escalates its efforts to make it harder for asylum seekers and migrants from certain countries to come to the US, detains undocumented migrants for longer periods of time and expands the use of private prison contracts in the immigration system. Attorneys said the conditions at some US detention centers were so brutal that migrants who have fled torture and violence \u201care forced to abandon viable claims for immigration relief and accept deportation out of a desperate desire to escape the torture they are enduring in detention on US soil\u201d. \u201cThey cannot take it any more,\u201d said Elissa Johnson, an attorney with the Southern Poverty Law Center, one of several not-for-profit organizations involved in the suit in Los Angeles. \u201cThat is not a choice that anyone should have to make,\u201d she told reporters.

When Faour Abdallah Fraihat arrived at Adelanto in December 2016, he reported an issue with a disc in his back and knee and was provided a temporary wheelchair. But the facility took it away after just one month, the complaint says. Fraihat made extensive requests for a wheelchair after that, sometimes on a daily basis, but did not receive one until February 2019, the suit says, adding that without a wheelchair, Fraihat couldn\u2019t get to the yard or the cafeteria and had to rely on officers to bring him food. Fraihat, 57, also suffered deteriorating vision while in custody, the suit says, but Ice refused to provide a surgery recommended by a doctor. He eventually lost vision in his left eye. Mentally ill and in solitary Mentally ill inmates at the centers languish in isolation, the suit alleges.

Jose Segovia Benitez, a 38-year-old US Marine Corps veteran who completed two tours of duty, has depression, anxiety, traumatic brain injury and combat PTSD. But Adelanto has subjected him to solitary confinement, which has exacerbated his mental health struggles, the complaint says. Denied medication And staff members at detention centers have made life-threatening medical mistakes, the complaint says. Mart\u00edn Mu\u00f1oz, who has been in the US for more than four decades and has diabetes, had an insulin overdose when Adelanto staff administered more than triple his regular dose, the suit says.

On at least one occasion, Mu\u00f1oz was left without high blood pressure medication for two weeks, when Adelanto ran out. Recently, he did not receive insulin for 10 days. He also allegedly went a week without his cholesterol medication. Systemic problems Al Otro Lado, a legal services organization and one of two not-for-profit groups serving as plaintiffs in the case, says in the suit it has struggled to support asylum seekers and refugees because its staff has to spend significant resources fighting for the medical needs of its existing clients. The organization says two of its clients lost their pregnancies in custody due to failed medical intervention and argues it has had to spend extensive time advocating for clients with HIV to get basic care and safe housing where they won\u2019t be exposed to infectious diseases. An Ice spokesperson declined to comment on the allegations but said there were \u201ctimely and appropriate responses to emergent medical requests\u201d, and that \u201ccomprehensive medical care is provided to all individuals\u201d in custody. A spokesperson for Geo Group, the private prison company that operates Adelanto and other centers for Ice, said the allegations were \u201cbaseless\u201d and that the corporation\u2019s medical programs \u201cprovide 24/7 access to health care free of charge\u201d and are \u201csupported by professional teams including full-time physicians\u201d.",

He continued: \u201cAnywhere where a tall building goes up, you find that somewhere you could be previously cycling happily, there is a wall of wind. \u201cYou can suddenly be really struggling. In the rush to put up tall buildings, no one has been thinking about what it means for aspirations to make cycling and walking simpler and safer. It\u2019s great that someone has started now.\u201d Alastair Moss, who chairs the corporation\u2019s planning and transportation committee, said the move was a first for the UK in prioritising cyclists and pedestrians, adding: \u201cWith the number of tall buildings in the Square Mile growing, it is important that the knock-on effects of new developments on wind at street level are properly considered.\u201d The tougher guidelines will require assessment of wind impacts at the very beginning of design development, with more micro-level tests from 36 wind directions, using separate consultants for computer and physical simulations. Exposed spots near the Thames, or near schools, parks or hospitals, will require additional checks. City workers combatting the gusts at the base of the Walkie-Talkie confirmed the effects of central London\u2019s skyscraper-induced microclimate. Christina Hommel, 30, who works in a neighbouring block, said: \u201cIt\u2019s windy every day: in the morning, when you leave work, and when you cross the street, it\u2019s super-windy. \u201cYou can start walking at the start of Fenchurch Street and it\u2019s fine and then you continue and the wind just comes at you. It\u2019s quite unexpected.\u201d James, 45, who works in the Walkie-Talkie, said: \u201cIt\u2019s pretty windy around here. I\u2019m all for these skyscraper buildings, I think they look quite nice but there is a downside to it all.\u201d",

But Israel\u2019s decision to bar the congresswomen entry threatens to undermine those ties, especially at a time when Democrats are increasingly critical of Netanyahu and his close alliance with Trump.</p> \n<p>Tlaib likened the decision to a ban imposed on a member of Congress seeking entry to South Africa during apartheid in 1972.</p> \n<p>\u201cHistory does have a habit of repeating itself,\u201d Tlaib said.

Omar called Israel\u2019s decision to block the planned official visit \u201cnothing less than an attempt by an ally of the United States to suppress our ability to do our jobs as elected officials\u201d and questioned the billions of dollars in US aid to the country. \u201cAs legislators we have an obligation to see the reality there for ourselves,\u201d Omar told reporters during a press conference at the Minnesota state house in St Paul on Monday. \u201cSo I would encourage my colleagues to visit. Meet with the people we were going to meet with, see the things we were going to see, hear the stories we were going to hear.\u201d Omar said Israel\u2019s decision was \u201cnot consistent with democracy\u201d and not reflective of actions taken by an ally of the US. Israel is the top recipient of US foreign aid and the country has long enjoyed bipartisan support. But Israel\u2019s decision to bar the congresswomen entry threatens to undermine those ties, especially at a time when Democrats are increasingly critical of Netanyahu and his close alliance with Trump. Tlaib likened the decision to a ban imposed on a member of Congress seeking entry to South Africa during apartheid in 1972. \u201cHistory does have a habit of repeating itself,\u201d Tlaib said. Omar later added that the difference between then and now was that the US government was promoting the ban as opposed to actively working to lift it. \u201cWhen you are a United States citizen, your president, your ambassadors, your state department [work] on your behalf,\u201d Omar said. \u201cThey defend you and fight for your right to freedom of speech [and] to freedom of movement. To have an administration and a president and an ambassador that is not doing that puts fear in many people\u2019s hearts.\u201d She added: \u201cWe must be asking, as Israel\u2019s ally, that Netanyahu stop the expansion of settlements on Palestinian land and ensure full rights for Palestinians if we are to give them aid.\u201d At the urging of Trump, Netanyahu denied entry to Omar and Tlaib, the first two Muslim women elected to Congress, over their support for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement (BDS) for Palestinian rights. Israel later relented and said the Detroit-born Tlaib could visit her 90-year-old grandmother, who lives in the occupied West Bank, if she did not promote the international boycott of Israel. Tlaib initially agreed but, facing criticism from some Palestinian activists, she changed her mind and announced that she would not travel to the country under \u201cthese oppressive conditions meant to humiliate me\u201d. Trump has tried to make Omar, Tlaib and the other half of the foursome known as \u201cthe Squad\u201d \u2013 all popular progressive congresswomen of color \u2013 the face of the Democratic party. In a series of racist tweets, Trump told the lawmakers to \u201cgo back\u201d to their home countries. All are US citizens, and only Omar was not born in the US. At the press conference, Tlaib tearfully described her decision not to make the trip after a late-night phone call with her family. \u201cI think my grandmother said it beautifully when she said I\u2019m her asfour. Asfour in Arabic means her bird. She said I\u2019m her dream manifested. I am her free bird. So why would I come back and be caged and bow down when my election rose her head up high?\u201d Tlaib said, her voice cracking. She added: \u201cWe all decided as a family that I could not go until I was a free, American, United States congresswoman.\u201d",

But then we took control again and could have won it.\u201d Neves\u2019s goal was awarded after a two-minute consultation with VAR, apparently as officials tried to determine whether there had been an offside in the buildup. Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo pleaded with authorities to find a way of reaching decisions more quickly. \u201cWhat I\u2019m afraid is we will be afraid to celebrate a goal,\u201d he said. \u201cThe energy and sound of Molineux, we cannot lose this atmosphere. They have to find a solution for it. Please do it.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r agreed but said he would rather \u201cthey get the decision right than get the wrong one but take only 15 seconds\u201d. Solskj\u00e6r also revealed that Alexis S\u00e1nchez could leave United before the European transfer window closes on 2 September. \u201cThere are still a couple of weeks left of the transfer window and some clubs have shown interest in Alexis, so we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Indigenous Australians should not be forced to adopt a compromised position or endure another round of consultation on constitutional recognition because Indigenous affairs minister Ken Wyatt has ruled out supporting a key proposal, Aboriginal leaders have said. Wyatt, the Labor senator Patrick Dodson and the Cape York leader Noel Pearson were all invited to be panellists on the ABC\u2019s Q&amp;A program on Monday, but none attended. The Labor MP Linda Burney and the APY Lands chairwoman, Sally Scales, criticised Wyatt, four days after he said in the annual Lingiari lecture that a constitutionally enshrined Indigenous voice to parliament would not be considered as part of a referendum on constitutional recognition. Instead he said he would take a \u201cpragmatic\u201d approach foreshadowed in a joint select committee report last year, and in his press club speech last month. Enshrining a representative First Nations body in the constitution was one of two key recommendations of the landmark Uluru Statement. Burney, the shadow Indigenous affairs spokeswoman, said Labor supported the Uluru Statement in full but she would continue to work with Wyatt in a bipartisan way. She said she was \u201cdisappointed\u201d that \u201cKen made the decision \u2013 someone made the decision \u2013 that Ken wasn\u2019t appearing\u201d on Q&amp;A, but that only he could explain why he felt a First Nations advisory body should not have constitutional protection. Scales said Wyatt\u2019s position pushed the debate on constitutional recognition back to 2015, before the idea of a symbolic reform was soundly rejected by national community dialogues. \u201cWe have had eight reports in eight years around constitutional recognition in one form or another,\u201d Scales said. \u201cDo we want to wait another eight years? Do we need another eight reports?\u201d Asked by host Tony Jones if she or other delegates who signed off on the Uluru Statement in 2017 would be prepared to compromise, Scales said: \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d \u201cWe have compromised so much already,\u201d she said. \u201cAs Indigenous Australians, as First Nations people, we have compromised a lot. So why do we have to keep compromising?\u201d Liberal senator Julian Leeser, who co-chaired a joint select committee, said Wyatt and the prime minister, Scott Morrison, both supported a referendum and an Indigenous voice to parliament, just not combining the two. He would not comment when asked if Wyatt had been told not to advocate for a constitutionally enshrined voice. Leeser, a leading constitutional conservative, has advocated support for the Uluru Statement and said he remained \u201ccommitted to constitutional recognition that involves recognition of some form of consultative mechanism for Indigenous people.\u201d Both Leeser and Burney said the next step of the process, the co-design of the voice between government and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, should be the urgent priority. \u201cWe should celebrate the fact that we have got a commitment to constitutional recognition and that\u2019s a bipartisan position, and we have a commitment to a voice and that\u2019s a bipartisan position, and we\u2019ve got a commitment to co-design.\u201d Leeser said. Alice Springs councillor Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, also on the panel, said the debate was a \u201cdistraction\u201d from grassroots issues like high rates of Indigenous suicide and family violence. The chief executive of the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation, Patricia Turner, rejected that suggestion. \u201cWell, it hasn\u2019t distracted me,\u201d Turner said. \u201cWe\u2019re working very hard to close the gap and to ensure that Aboriginal voices are at the table in negotiations with government as equals.\u201d Burney said the debate was not \u201ca zero-sum game.\u201d \u201cThis is not about a voice as opposed to social justice issues,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is about both of those things at the same time.\u201d Burney, Turner and Scales said the government needed to \u201cget on with it\u201d. \u201cWe can\u2019t leave this for another generation to have the same discussion about a permanent, secure voice to the Australian parliament, representing the views of First Nations people,\u201d Burney said.",

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn has demanded that Boris Johnson immediately publish the Operation Yellowhammer assessments of how disruptive a no-deal Brexit would be after ministers claimed a leaked version from less than three weeks ago was out of date and full of scaremongering. The Labour leader said it was essential that businesses be given an accurate assessment of the difficulties they may face under a no-deal Brexit, arguing that Johnson\u2019s reassurances \u201ccannot be trusted\u201d. The prime minister claimed on Monday that a no-deal Brexit would merely involve \u201cbumps in the road\u201d, despite the leaked Yellowhammer document predicting shortages of food, medicine and fuel. But Corbyn said these denials \u201cwill do nothing to give businesses or consumers any confidence that the dire state of affairs described in the documents aren\u2019t right around the corner\u201d. Speaking before a visit to businesses in Stevenage on Tuesday, Corbyn said: \u201cThe government\u2019s own Operation Yellowhammer dossier makes the chaos and damage that will be caused by Boris Johnson\u2019s no-deal Brexit crystal clear. \u201cIf the government wants to be believed that it doesn\u2019t represent the real impact, it must publish its most recent assessments today in full.\u201d He added: \u201cWhat we know for sure is that this government is wilfully committed to a policy that the prime minister and the cabinet know will destroy jobs, push up food prices in the shops and open up our NHS to a takeover by US private companies.\u201d Corbyn joined calls from more than 100 MPs for a recall of parliament to address the worries about a no-deal Brexit, but Downing Street rejected that idea. Whitehall sources said Michael Gove, the minister in charge of no-deal planning and Johnson\u2019s righthand man in the Vote Leave campaign, would address parliament about the UK\u2019s readiness to leave the EU without a deal when it returned in September. \u201cThe House of Commons agreed the date it would rise for summer recess, as well as its return on 3 September, and this was passed by a majority of close to 200 MPs,\u201d the prime minister\u2019s spokeswoman said. Downing Street said the documents were out of date and had been prepared under Theresa May\u2019s government, even though they were dated and circulated in early August after Johnson had taken over as prime minister. \u201cIn relation to business, we have been engaging widely and will continue to do so, and that\u2019s been significantly stepped up in recent weeks,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cWe have published numerous documents on how businesses can prepare. \u201cYou can expect to see further information being published in the coming weeks in relation to how the public \u2026 can further prepare and the changes that they are likely to see across a range of areas.\u201d The Cabinet Office documents, marked \u201cofficial sensitive\u201d and reportedly prepared earlier this month, examined the government\u2019s contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit. The files also said efforts to avoid the return of a hard border in Ireland were likely to prove \u201cunsustainable\u201d in such a scenario, with fears of \u201cdirect action\u201d and road blockades. A public information campaign targeting consumers is being prepared for the next couple of weeks, in which digital media, newspapers, TV and radio will be used to explain how people can prepare for Brexit. \u201cThe delay in information is that we have been preparing gov.uk for a massive traffic increase,\u201d the source said. \u201cWe know there is an appetite from the government for more information, particularly around no deal. It will be things like travel and passports, and [will be] more user-friendly.\u201d In further pressure on the government, Hilary Benn, the chair of the Brexit committee, wrote to Gove demanding clarification on aspects of the Yellowhammer report and calling on him to appear before the committee at the earliest opportunity when parliament returns. He asked to know the date on which the report was drawn up, any significant steps that the government has taken since then in the past three weeks, and how these have mitigated each of the risks identified in the report and to what extent. Since entering office, Johnson has been ramping up no-deal preparations, setting aside an extra \u00a32bn for contingency measures and mitigation. A new planning exercise, codenamed Yellow Rehearse, was reported by BuzzFeed to be taking place so that diplomats and Whitehall departments could run through the possible consequences of a no-deal Brexit in early October. The government did not confirm the operation but a spokesman said it \u201cregularly conducts scenario-based exercises to ensure its plans are robust, including in relation to Brexit\u201d.",

Labour announced it would make it illegal to train or keep marmosets, capuchins, squirrel monkeys and lemurs, as the political parties begin to set out their policies ahead of a possible general election this autumn. Animal welfare issues harmed the Conservatives in the 2017 election, after the party pledged to hold a free vote on hunting and was criticised for failing to include a policy on banning the ivory trade in its manifesto. Ahead of a potential poll this autumn, Labour restated its commitment to banning the keeping of monkeys, as part of its animal welfare manifesto due to be published in the next few weeks. Luke Pollard, the shadow environment minister, said: \u201cIt is astonishing that it is still entirely legal to keep primates as pets, regardless of how endangered or dangerous the animal is. Anyone can browse the internet and buy a primate with little or no checks and inspections. \u201cWe know that primates are very intelligent, social animals with complex needs that simply cannot be met in a home environment. \u201cLabour will ban people from keeping pet primates as part of our plans to bring Britain\u2019s animal welfare laws into the 21st century.\u201d Labour said an estimated 5,000 primates are being kept as pets in the UK, but they are highly intelligent animals and not suitable to be kept in captivity. Current legislation states that animal owners must prevent \u201cunnecessary suffering\u201d and must take \u201call reasonable steps to meet their animal\u2019s needs\u201d, but Labour argued it is difficult to enforce and a breach of its provisions is not an offence.",

At first I thought, \u2018It\u2019s typical you, you\u2019re selfish, why are you even thinking about taking a penalty off a player?\u2019 But we\u2019ve looked at the footage of last week\u2019s penalty and Pogba and Rashford had a long chat before that as well. It\u2019s weird. Only Ole Gunnar Solskjaer can tell us what happened.\u201d</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-19T20:55:47.570Z\">at 9.55pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d5b0bdc8f081cf11cf19734\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-19T20:52:29.874Z\">9.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Well, that was a lot of fun</strong>.

Manchester United have had some unlikely bogey teams down the years. West Brom in the late 1970s; Norwich in the late 1980s; Southampton in the mid 1990s; Middlesbrough in the early 2000s; just about everyone since 2013. Their newest nemesis is Wolves, who tonight are aiming to beat United at Molineux for the third time in less than six months.</p> <p>Their two 2-1 wins last season \u2013 one in the FA Cup, one in the league \u2013 sent United into a tailspin after that amazing start under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. They showed the first signs of recovery with a stirring 4-0 win over Chelsea last weekend, but this is a different - and arguably tougher - test. </p> <p>In those two games last season, Wolves dictated the match by not dictating it \u2013 both teams prefer to play on the counter-attack, and Wolves had less of the ball each time. They rode their luck a little in the league, but the FA Cup performance was a masterclass in playing like the away side at home. </p> <p>They will use exactly the same tactics tonight. It\u2019s up to United to do something about it.</p> <p><strong>Kick off is at 8pm.</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/17/wolves-manchester-united-match-preview\">Wolves v Manchester United: match preview</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-19T18:14:10.439Z\">at 7.14pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it for tonight\u2019s blog. I\u2019ll leave you with the brilliant Paul Doyle\u2019s match report from Molineux. Night! Ole Gunnar Solskjaer speaks \u201cWe knew they would come out like a house on fire in the second half, and they got the goal they probably deserved. We took control again after that and we could have won it. I thought we finished the game the strongest. The first half was a mature performance, the second was a bit sloppier. We\u2019re a young team and we are improving. You have to learn on the pitch. \u201cPaul and Marcus are the designated penalty-takers, and it\u2019s up to them to decide there and then who feels, \u2018This is mine.\u2019 That\u2019s our system, you can see the slides on the Powerpoint. [Will it change?] No, not at all. The two of them have been very confident and I like players with confidence. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was a booking [for Daniel James]. I haven\u2019t seen the video; if you\u2019ve got it, show it me, but when I saw it live I didn\u2019t think it was a dive. He gets kicked a lot because of his pace.\u201d Ruben Neves speaks \u201cWe had to adjust at half-time. Man Utd started really well, pressed us high up the pitch, and we found it difficult to control the game. We adjusted, took some risks and did well in the second half. \u201cWe worked on that corner during the week, and fortunately I scored. I\u2019m really happy. It\u2019s horrible, honestly [waiting for VAR], but that\u2019s football now. Thankfully this time they gave us the goal.\u201d Sky\u2019s football coverage is great, part 431242342389 Gary Neville: \u201cIt\u2019s not like ... spin the bottle.\u201d Jamie Carragher: \u201cWho\u2019ve you played spin the bottle with?!\u201d That was Pogba\u2019s fourth penalty miss in a year. He\u2019s missed 36 per cent of his Premier League penalties. Marcus Rashford, I think, has missed 0 per cent of his in senior football. Neville is properly on one about the penalty. He\u2019s said \u201cthis is not right\u201d umpteen times. \u201cThis is a Manchester United penalty. This is not a tombola. This is not under-5s on the playground.\u201d Here\u2019s Gary Neville on Paul Pogba \u201cBefore he even took the penalty I was fuming. I\u2019m not sure whether Rashford took the one off Pogba last week or vice versa tonight. Why is there a debate on who takes a penalty? There should never be a debate. There wasn\u2019t a leader on the pitch tonight. Something\u2019s not right there. At first I thought, \u2018It\u2019s typical you, you\u2019re selfish, why are you even thinking about taking a penalty off a player?\u2019 But we\u2019ve looked at the footage of last week\u2019s penalty and Pogba and Rashford had a long chat before that as well. It\u2019s weird. Only Ole Gunnar Solskjaer can tell us what happened.\u201d Well, that was a lot of fun. Martial scored a fine goal, Neves equalised with a scorcher and Pogba missed a penalty. Both teams will feel they could have won, United in particular, but both will be reasonably happy with a point. United almost stole it at the last, when Pogba\u2019s low cross just evaded Martial. Shaw spanked the loose ball at Patricio but by then Pereira had been penalised for blocking a defender. Peep peep! 90+3 min Nothing much is happening. 90+1 min Another Wolves sub: Patrick Cutrone replaces the marvellous Raul Jimenez. 90+1 min Four minutes of added time. Neto tries to run Wan-Bissaka, who stalks him and makes another fine interception. 90 min Maguire slides a nice pass down the inside-left channel to find Martial, who is wrongly flagged offside. 89 min A double change for United: Greenwood replaces James, Pereira replaces Rashford. 88 min \u201cThe incessant moaning about VAR is worse than any amount of time \u2018wasted\u2019 on getting correct refereeing decisions,\u201d says Gustav Bj\u00f6rklund. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t have VAR tonight, former top 6 club players turned pundits would be zooming in on still footage with evidence of error in refeering, complaining that it was missed, or saying they got away with it, based on which club they played for. That is not a better system. It doesn\u2019t matter if someone is 5 millimeters or 5 meters offside - the rule still applies, and he same goes for handball or any other offence. It\u2019s the same as before, where a human referee makes a judgement call, helped by the three other officials in the stadium, only now the ref on the pitch is helped on by yet another ref, this one in a shed near Heathrow. The moaning has to stop.\u201d But what about the people moaning about the people moaning? 87 min A Wolves sub: Neto on, Jota off. 86 min Wolves break superbly down the left through Jota, whose deep cross is screwed over the bar from a tight angle by Dendoncker. 85 min And this is no different, Mata failing to clear the first man. 85 min James beats Jota superbly and finds Wan-Bissaka, whose cross deflects behind for a corner. United\u2019s set-pieces have been poor tonight. 85 min \u201cI\u2019d prefer to see VAR quietly buried and never spoken of again,\u201d says Ciar\u00e1n McCabe. \u201cBut if it is here to stay, how about a time limit? If the VAR team cannot decide within 30 seconds of the incident with the aid of replays there was no clear and obvious error. Play on!\u201d I like the idea in principle, but I\u2019ve a feeling there would be unforeseeable fiascos. 84 min Wan-Bissaka is booked for blocking the ball with his shoulder. Jon Moss, the referee, hasn\u2019t had a great game. 82 min Traore beats Shaw yet again and swings a high cross towards Jota beyond the far post. He tries to head the ball back into the far corner but plants it straight at de Gea. 81 min Juan Mata replaces Jesse Lingard, who had a fair-to-mediocre game. At his best Lingard is a deceptively dangerous player, but he hasn\u2019t been at his best for a while now. 80 min Traore beats three players on a storming run before driving a dangerous low cross that is cleared by Lindelof. 79 min I certainly don\u2019t think Rashford bottled the penalty - he took one in a World Cup match, and also scored the winner against PSG. I suspect he is slightly in awe of Pogba and deferred to him. 78 min An execrable pass from Shaw gives Wolves the chance to break, but Wan-Bissaka makes an important interception. He\u2019s had an outstanding game. 77 min Rashford\u2019s curler from the edge of the box is blocked by Bennett, and then James - who has had a good second half - wins a corner. 75 min I did Pogba a disservice. What seems to have happened is this: Pogba picked the ball up, having won the penalty, and Rashford was happy for him to take it. It\u2019s still a load of nonsense, though, because Rashford is a far better penalty taker. 73 min Wolves are chasing not just a hat-trick of wins, but a hat-trick of 2-1 wins against Manchester United at Molineux this year. I don\u2019t think this game will end 1-1. 72 min \u201cSurely VAR has got to bring in the equivalent of the \u2018umpire\u2019s call\u2019 rule in cricket - either that or hire an anatomist to decide where a shoulder becomes an arm,\u201d says Dan C. \u201cThe theatre of the Neves goal was ruined by 2 minutes watching someone move a line a few pixels back and forth, it\u2019s kind of pathetic.\u201d I\u2019d get rid of the whole sorry shambles. But assuming we are stuck with it, they should definitely introduce something like that for offsides. 70 min James scurries into the box and has a shot blocked by Coady. This has been a cracking second half. 69 min I would suggest that Gary Neville\u2019s views on that penalty may be worth watching after the game. It seems Pogba pulled rank on Rashford, even though Rashford is a much better penalty taker. 68 min Nice one, Paul. He bulleted the penalty towards goal, and Patricio flew to his right to beat it away. It wasn\u2019t a terrible penalty, but it was at a saveable height. And when you pull a stunt like, you\u2019d better score. Marcus Rashford took the penalty last week - but Pogba is going to take this. 67 min Coady is penalised for fouling Pogba, and there are no complaints. 67 min Bennett is booked for an inept challenge on Rashford, who\u2019d skinned him on the break. 65 min United have responded reasonably well to the equaliser, and are having a lot of the ball again. But they look much less composed than they did in the first half, both with and without the ball. 63 min Rashford tries to score from a ludicrous angle and distance on the left, and cracks it miles wide of the near post. \u201cWhat the bloody blazes was that?\u201d chant the Wolves fans. 62 min The primal roar when Neves scored was a thing of beauty. 61 min McTominay has a crack from 25 yards; Moutinho blocks. 59 min Traore dances into the area from the right before dragging a left-footed shot well wide. Wolves are all over United, who must be starting to wonder whether it\u2019s happening again. The goal is given! And it\u2019s worth repeating that it was a storming goal. Moutinho may have been offside when the corner was played back to him, after which he drilled it to Neves on the edge of the area. VAR check for offside Oh lord. That was a stunning goal. Moutinho took a short corner on the right and hammered the ball back towards Neves, in space on the edge of the area. As the United players charged out, Neves got the ball out of his feet in a hurry and smacked a gorgeous, booming curler that brushed the fingertip of the stretching de Gea and flew in off the underside of the bar. It hit the back of the net and then bounced back up onto the underside of the bar on its way out. Great goal. What a goal from Ruben Neves! 54 min: Jimenez hits the post! It was a brilliant effort, a flicked header at the near post from Moutinho\u2019s outswinging free-kick. It clattered of the inside of the post, hit De Gea and bounced to safety. 54 min Traore is fouled just outside the area by Maguire, who isn\u2019t impressed with the decision. 52 min After a patient passing move from United, Wan-Bissaka shapes to shoot and then plays a disguised through pass that just evades Lingard in the area. Wan-Bissaka has been the best player on the pitch so far, for mine. 51 min Neves is booked for a foul on James. 50 min Wolves have made a much faster start to the second half - but they almost go 2-0 down when Lingard completely miskicks an inviting cross from Wan-Bissaka. It was a slightly awkward ball, which bounced in front of him, and he shanked it completely. 47 min James slips and plants his studs into Jota\u2019s ankle. He\u2019s on a yellow card, so he needs to be careful. I think that was an accident; if not, he\u2019s lucky to be on the pitch. 46 min Peep peep! The second half is underway. Wolves have made a change, with Traore replacing Doherty. Half-time reading Peep peep! Manchester United deservedly lead through Anthony Martial\u2019s excellent goal in the 27th minute. That was their only real chance, but they dominated possession throughout and played with confidence and authority. Wolves can play better, though, and probably will in the second half. 45+1 min Martial almost gets a second on the stroke of half-time. He scooted onto a half-arsed backpass from Bennett, pushed the ball away from the last man Boly with his right foot - but his left foot landed on the ball and sent it spinning behind him. 44 min Wan-Bissaka is having a cracking game at right-back. He looks so hard to beat one against one. 42 min James\u2019 clipped cross is chested down near the penalty spot by Martial, but he can\u2019t find any room for a shot at goal. 41 min Shaw shows surprising pace to scoot past Doherty and win a corner. Rashford\u2019s inswinger is headed back across goal by Maguire and eventually cleared. 39 min Pogba is penalised for a foul on Moutinho. There\u2019s a VAR check to see whether Pogba deserves to be sent off. He doesn\u2019t; it was just a tangle of legs. 37 min Wolves had a little flurry of possession after the goal but United have resumed control for the last five minutes. 36 min Rashford sweeps a sharp pass into Martial on the edge of the D. He turns smartly and wriggles away from Boly but not the last man Coady. 35 min Pogba plays a lovely pass down the right to James, whose first-time cross is intercepted by the stretching Coady. James is being booed, with feeling, every time he gets the ball. He\u2019s looked slightly nervous in possession, but his work rate without the ball has been impressive. 33 min We\u2019ve seen almost nothing of Ruben Neves so far. 32 min Moutinho\u2019s corner rebounds to Jimenez, whose stinging snapshot is blocked by Pogba. 31 min Human nature being what it is, Wolves have had much more of the ball since the goal. Jota wins a corner off Wan-Bissaka. After 27 minutes of probing, United finally got behind Wolves for the first time. Lingard pushed the ball infield from the left to Rashford, who slid a nice short pass down the side of the defence into the path of Martial. He ran away from Boly and crashed a rising shot past Patricio with his left foot. Anthony Martial gives Manchester United the lead with a thumping finish. 25 min Lindelof shanks the ball towards his own goal, but redeems his error with a header back to De Gea. It\u2019s an interesting game, but not yet an exciting one. 24 min Dan James has been booked for diving. That looked a good decision from Jon Moss, although replays suggest he might have been caught. It\u2019s hard to be sure. What we do know is that he\u2019s going to be booed for the rest of the game. 23 min \u201cGiven both teams\u2019 strengths on the counter,\u201d says Oliver Atkinson, \u201cthis feels like the sort of game where Wolves are having the better of it on account of United having all of the ball.\u201d Yes, Wolves have looked the slightly more dangerous team, even though they\u2019ve only had about a quarter of the possession. 19 min Here\u2019s Sean Clayton on the subject of bogey teams. \u201cIt feels like a long time ago but Sheffield Wednesday absolutely owned Man United for several seasons in the late 80s and early 90s. In retrospect, that late brace of injury time goals by Steve Bruce was the beginning of a long decline for the mighty Owls...\u201d Nigel bloody Jemson. 18 min Pogba sprays a long crossfield pass to Rashford on the left. He twists Bennett one way and then the other before curling a wicked inswinging cross that just evades Martial in the six-yard box. 18 min Wan-Bissaka makes a good tackle to stop Jota\u2019s run down the left. Jimenez and Jota look really sharp on the counter-attack. 16 min Pogba fouls Jota 40 yards from goalk. Moutinho\u2019s inswinging free-kick is headed away by Harry Magnet. 14 min United are struggling to get behind the Wolves defence, which is so well organised. There\u2019s so much pace in this United team, but there isn\u2019t. Pogba excepted, a huge amount of guile. 12 min Under normal circumstances you\u2019d say this has been an excellent start for United, who have dominated possession (72 per cent) and played with breezy purpose. But given their recent history with Wolves, they might wonder whether they are walking into a trap. 10 min \u201cObviously, I\u2019m no United fan,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201c But I am a very big admirer of Dan James. He is terrifyingly fast, with a decent end product, and just seems like such a damn nice young man. I\u2019m looking forward to watching him tear up trees for Wales, and hoping he gets the chance to develop at United. And, you would need a heart of stone not to smile at the sheer, unadulterated, childlike joy in his goal celebration last week. Go on, son.\u201d 10 min Shaw\u2019s corner is headed clear at the far post. 9 min Now it\u2019s United\u2019s turn to counter, from that Wolves corner, and James wins a corner at the other end. 9 min The corner is slabheaded away by Maguire. 8 min James loses the ball on the right - I thought he was fouled, but Jon Moss didn\u2019t - and Wolves spring forward to win a corner at the other end. 5 min United have had almost all of the ball in the first five minutes, though Wolves won\u2019t really mind that. They are lethal on the break. 3 min \u201cI like Lingard, he\u2019s a decent player who always puts in a shift,\u201d says Sandile Xaso, \u201cbut how much better would this team look with a class act like James Maddison in it? It was startling to see him not only be the best player on the pitch at Stamford Bridge yesterday, but by such a large margin.\u201d Yes, I really like Maddison, who looks a class act. I suspect he will have a lot of suitors next summer. 2 min A couple of lively early challenges, first from McTominay and then Coady. Both were fair tackles, but they were also meaningful. 1 min Peep peep! Wolves, in the old gold, kick off from right to left. United are in red. We\u2019re having a few technical issues, but they\u2019ll hopefully be sorted before kick-off. The players have just emerged to the usual cracking atmosphere. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer speaks \u201c[Dan James] has made an impact from day one. We\u2019ll chop and change at times this season. Andreas played very well last week but we think Dan is the right choice for tonight. He gives us the X-factor of his pace, and he\u2019s incredibly hard working off the ball. \u201cThis is not a happy hunting ground for me \u2013 three games here [as a player and manager], three defeats. I was thinking of staying at home tonight! We know Wolverhampton are a tough side; they maybe deserved more than finishing seventh last season. We know they don\u2019t concede many goals and we\u2019ll have to be clinical when we get chances.\u201d \u201cDo you know if the average age of this United team remains the youngest in this week\u2019s round of PL fixtures?\u201d says Matt Richman. \u201cI have to say I\u2019m impressed with the repeated faith in the team\u2019s youth.\u201d It is, yeah. It\u2019s also slightly younger than the Chelsea team, with James (21) replacing Pereira (23). Nuno Espirito Santo speaks \u201cIt\u2019s a big game, a big challenge for us. We did a lot of things well against them last season. I expect a tough game \u2013 they are confident, so we have to take care of everything and look for our chance. The answer of the players has been very good [to the extra workload]. The idea is to be united and embrace everything in front of us.\u201d Some pre-match reading Daniel James makes his full debut for United, replacing Andreas Pereira. Wolves are unchanged from their last Premier League game, the 0-0 draw at Leicester eight days ago. Wolves (3-5-2) Patricio; Bennett, Coady, Boly; Doherty, Dendoncker, Neves, Moutinho, Jonny; Jimenez, Jota. Substitutes: Ruddy, Vinagre, Gibbs-White, Saiss, Neto, Cutrone, Traore. Manchester United (4-2-3-1) De Gea; Wan-Bissaka, Lindelof, Maguire, Shaw; McTominay, Pogba; James, Lingard, Rashford; Martial. Substitutes: Romero, Young, Tuanzebe, Mata, Pereira, Matic, Greenwood. Referee Jon Moss. Hello. Manchester United have had some unlikely bogey teams down the years. West Brom in the late 1970s; Norwich in the late 1980s; Southampton in the mid 1990s; Middlesbrough in the early 2000s; just about everyone since 2013. Their newest nemesis is Wolves, who tonight are aiming to beat United at Molineux for the third time in less than six months. Their two 2-1 wins last season \u2013 one in the FA Cup, one in the league \u2013 sent United into a tailspin after that amazing start under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. They showed the first signs of recovery with a stirring 4-0 win over Chelsea last weekend, but this is a different - and arguably tougher - test. In those two games last season, Wolves dictated the match by not dictating it \u2013 both teams prefer to play on the counter-attack, and Wolves had less of the ball each time. They rode their luck a little in the league, but the FA Cup performance was a masterclass in playing like the away side at home. They will use exactly the same tactics tonight. It\u2019s up to United to do something about it. Kick off is at 8pm.",

      "body": "<p>Good morning, this is Stephen Smiley bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 20 August.</p> <h2>Top stories</h2> <p><strong>The British government has privately appealed to senior </strong><strong> ministers in the Morrison government to develop a more \u201cambitious\u201d climate policy.</strong> As the government fends off criticism from Pacific Island nations about its climate policies, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/19/uk-privately-appeals-to-senior-australian-ministers-for-climate-action\">Guardian Australia can reveal</a> that the UK\u2019s high commissioner to Australia, Vicki Treadell, has met with Angus Taylor and Marise Payne since the May election. It\u2019s understood the high commissioner\u2019s meeting with Taylor, who is the government\u2019s emissions reduction minister, took place in early July, while a bilateral meeting between Treadell and Payne, the foreign affairs minister, also raised the need for more ambitious climate action. The UK last month became the first G7 country to legislate a target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.</p> <p><strong>With the debate around the low rate of Newstart raging, a 64-year-old woman has detailed how she was forced to volunteer after quitting her job of 27 years to care for her dying husband. </strong>Two years ago, Marie Jentner was caring for Siegried, who had testicular cancer and couldn\u2019t walk or look after himself. But when he was moved into palliative care at a nursing home in the Adelaide suburb of Rosewater, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/20/really-upset-welfare-changes-forced-woman-to-volunteer-as-husband-was-dying\">Centrelink cancelled Jentner\u2019s carer\u2019s payment, putting her on the lower Newstart allowance instead</a>. \u201cI retired in 2017 to stay home and look after my husband,\u201d Jentner tells Guardian Australia. \u201cI\u2019ve worked nearly 45 years of my life, and there\u2019s no way I wanted to go back to work. And they said, \u2018Well, you need to do something because the government has changed things. You need to be on Newstart. You could do either community work, or volunteering\u2019.\u201d</p> <p><strong>A majority of voters in New South Wales either strongly support or somewhat support removing abortion from the criminal code</strong>, according to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/20/essential-poll-majority-of-nsw-voters-support-removing-abortion-from-criminal-code\">latest Guardian Essential poll</a>.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Stephen Smiley bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 20 August. Top stories The British government has privately appealed to senior ministers in the Morrison government to develop a more \u201cambitious\u201d climate policy. As the government fends off criticism from Pacific Island nations about its climate policies, Guardian Australia can reveal that the UK\u2019s high commissioner to Australia, Vicki Treadell, has met with Angus Taylor and Marise Payne since the May election. It\u2019s understood the high commissioner\u2019s meeting with Taylor, who is the government\u2019s emissions reduction minister, took place in early July, while a bilateral meeting between Treadell and Payne, the foreign affairs minister, also raised the need for more ambitious climate action. The UK last month became the first G7 country to legislate a target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. With the debate around the low rate of Newstart raging, a 64-year-old woman has detailed how she was forced to volunteer after quitting her job of 27 years to care for her dying husband. Two years ago, Marie Jentner was caring for Siegried, who had testicular cancer and couldn\u2019t walk or look after himself. But when he was moved into palliative care at a nursing home in the Adelaide suburb of Rosewater, Centrelink cancelled Jentner\u2019s carer\u2019s payment, putting her on the lower Newstart allowance instead. \u201cI retired in 2017 to stay home and look after my husband,\u201d Jentner tells Guardian Australia. \u201cI\u2019ve worked nearly 45 years of my life, and there\u2019s no way I wanted to go back to work. And they said, \u2018Well, you need to do something because the government has changed things. You need to be on Newstart. You could do either community work, or volunteering\u2019.\u201d A majority of voters in New South Wales either strongly support or somewhat support removing abortion from the criminal code, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll. With debate on the proposal set to resume in the NSW upper house, the latest survey shows 71% of voters in the sample support the change, with only 17% against. A total of 12% of those polled were unsure. The sanguine voter sentiment represented in the poll is at odds with the clamour and contention in the political debate. In the two weeks since the historic bill passed its first hurdle in the parliament\u2019s lower house, opponents of the legislation have fought hard to stop it becoming law. World Prince Andrew should give sworn testimony on \u201ceverything he knows\u201d about his friend Jeffrey Epstein, lawyers for some of the victims of the disgraced financier\u2019s sex crimes have said. Epstein, 66, died this month in an apparent suicide. The medical and psychological condition of 107 people onboard a rescue boat anchored off the Italian island of Lampedusa has reached breaking point, doctors have said. The vessel, operated by the Spanish charity Proactiva Open Arms, has been refused permission to dock for 18 days by Italy\u2019s far-right interior minister, Matteo Salvini. A convoy of Turkish tanks and troops travelling in Idlib province in Syria has been hit by regime airstrikes, Ankara claims. Columns of Turkish forces, amounting to Ankara\u2019s largest incursion into Syria yet, crossed the southern border on Monday, at a time seen as pivotal for Idlib \u2013 the last corner of Syria without a regime presence. Plans to end freedom of movement for EU citizens immediately after a no-deal Brexit have caused anxiety and confusion among European nationals in the UK. Rules allowing EU nationals to live and work freely in the UK would end abruptly if the UK leaves the bloc without an agreement at the end of October. Robert de Niro\u2019s company has sued an ex-employee for $6m for embezzlement and Netflix bingeing. Canal Productions alleges Chase Robinson accrued enormous hotel and Uber bills, and spent hours at work watching and streaming TV. Opinion and analysis The latest labour force figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics demonstrate that the economy is showing signs of weakness.

      "body": "<p>It has been 40 years since Lord Mountbatten was killed \u2013 or \u201cexecuted\u201d as the IRA put it \u2013 while on a boat trip during his annual Irish summer holiday, in a bomb blast that also killed three others, including two teenage boys. Hours later, two more bombs went off 100 miles away, killing 18 soldiers from the parachute regiment, the biggest single loss of the British army in Northern Ireland. Not a day that is easy to forget, but what is clear from The Day Mountbatten Died (BBC Two) is just how present the emotions of loss are four decades on.</p> <p>The rescue helicopter crew member who pulled Mountbatten\u2019s 14-year-old grandson, Nicholas, out of the water says unflinchingly that he sees his face \u201cover and over \u2026 I\u2019m OK with that because I brought that kid home\u201d. India Hicks, Mountbatten\u2019s granddaughter who, aged 11, was there on holiday (but not on the boat that day) seems surprised at how tearful she becomes. \u201cThe damage that was done was so much deeper than any of us could ever have imagined,\u201d she says, voice barely holding up. \u201cAnd adult lives are still being horrifically disrupted.\u201d</p> <p>The film is a plea to remember, while skilfully telling the story of the day \u2013 and the context in which it took place \u2013 mainly through those who were there (although it\u2019s a shame that Timothy Knatchbull, who wrote a book about surviving the blast that killed his two grandparents and his twin brother, didn\u2019t feature).</p> <p>Every year, Mountbatten \u2013 the Queen\u2019s second cousin and the last viceroy of India \u2013 took his family to Classiebawn Castle in Mullaghmore, County Sligo, just 13 miles from the border. \u201cThe heart of the holiday was going out on the boat,\u201d remembers Hicks. It seems impossible to make a BBC documentary featuring the royal family that doesn\u2019t have the sheen of unctuousness. Mountbatten and his family, said his biographer Philip Ziegler, were regarded as \u201cbenevolent, well-meaning, helpful\u201d by the villagers. They brought \u201cglamour\u201d and jobs. One, who worked as a waiter at the house, treasures a photograph of himself serving the family; his mother still has a Barbara Cartland book given to her by Mountbatten.</p> <p>It\u2019s not all cosy paternalism. \u201cClassiebawn itself had been a fairly early example of what you might call English colonisation,\u201d says Ziegler. Hicks remembers the mountainside where \u201cthere was a big painted sign saying \u2018Brits go home\u2019. You arrive for your summer holiday and that\u2019s the welcome.\u201d The family had protection from the local police, but not to an excessive degree.</p> <p>The retelling of the blast itself \u2013 caused by a 50lb remote-controlled bomb planted the night before \u2013 was gut-wrenching. It was like a crack of thunder, recalls Mary Hornsey, the mother of 15-year-old Paul Maxwell, who had a summer job as Mountbatten\u2019s boat boy. \u201cI knew he was dead because I felt a part of me go.\u201d</p> <p>A few hours later, a bomb targeted an army convoy near Warrenpoint. Tom Caughey, one of just two survivors from the lorry that was hit, vividly describes gathering his strength to let his troop know he was still alive. They were doing, he says, \u201ca roll call of the dead\u201d. Half an hour later, another bomb went off by a gate lodge \u2013 the IRA unit rightly believed that was where the soldiers would regroup \u2013 taking the toll to 18. It was, says the company commander, Mike Jackson, with stiff upper lip understatement, \u201ca pretty grim sight\u201d, before going on to remember there were body parts in the trees. A civilian also died, shot by a soldier who wrongly believed he was involved in the attack.</p> <p>The feel of the IRA prisoners, remembers Anthony McIntyre, a former member who was in the Maze prison, was \u201cexuberance, exhilaration\u201d at the news. Olivia O\u2019Leary, a reporter at the Irish Times, puts it in context of the horrific events of Bloody Sunday seven years earlier. \u201cThere was a particular feeling of dislike towards the paratroopers,\u201d she says.</p> <p>But the targeting of Mountbatten and his family was different. \u201cAlmost everybody spoke with regret and shame about what had happened to Mountbatten,\u201d says O\u2019Leary. McIntyre, pointing out that senior IRA figures would have known children would have been on the boat, calls it a \u201cwar crime\u201d.</p> <p>There was nothing truly revelatory here, not even the fairly flat disclosure from Kieran Conway, the one-time director of intelligence for the IRA, that an assassination attempt on Mountbatten had been considered four years earlier. But there was plenty of genuine feeling. \u201cI wanted to be with them,\u201d says Caughey of his dead comrades. \u201cWhy did I survive?\u201d The grief of Maxwell\u2019s mother is almost unbearable to watch.</p> <p>In contrast is the weirdness of the upper classes. Hicks remembers being taken with her siblings into the castle\u2019s study and given pills to swallow. \u201cDear God. Would you give an 11-year-old Valium?\u201d she asks, incredulous. She was sent off to boarding school just a week after her grandfather\u2019s state funeral, where other girls made horrible jokes about his death. A clip of Prince Charles giving a speech about the murder of his mentor shows him reciting poetry instead of talking like a normal person.</p> <p>O\u2019Leary swiftly punctures his invocation of Yeats\u2019s line about peace \u201cdropping slow\u201d. \u201cPeace has to be worked at damn hard,\u201d she says. It is not, she says, \u201ca passive thing. It is always going to be a continuing responsibility on all of us in these islands to make sure that the conditions in Northern Ireland do not encourage the breakout again of sectarian tensions.\u201d Maddeningly, there are people now who need to be reminded of this.</p>",

India Hicks, Mountbatten\u2019s granddaughter who, aged 11, was there on holiday (but not on the boat that day) seems surprised at how tearful she becomes. \u201cThe damage that was done was so much deeper than any of us could ever have imagined,\u201d she says, voice barely holding up. \u201cAnd adult lives are still being horrifically disrupted.\u201d The film is a plea to remember, while skilfully telling the story of the day \u2013 and the context in which it took place \u2013 mainly through those who were there (although it\u2019s a shame that Timothy Knatchbull, who wrote a book about surviving the blast that killed his two grandparents and his twin brother, didn\u2019t feature). Every year, Mountbatten \u2013 the Queen\u2019s second cousin and the last viceroy of India \u2013 took his family to Classiebawn Castle in Mullaghmore, County Sligo, just 13 miles from the border. \u201cThe heart of the holiday was going out on the boat,\u201d remembers Hicks. It seems impossible to make a BBC documentary featuring the royal family that doesn\u2019t have the sheen of unctuousness. Mountbatten and his family, said his biographer Philip Ziegler, were regarded as \u201cbenevolent, well-meaning, helpful\u201d by the villagers. They brought \u201cglamour\u201d and jobs. One, who worked as a waiter at the house, treasures a photograph of himself serving the family; his mother still has a Barbara Cartland book given to her by Mountbatten. It\u2019s not all cosy paternalism. \u201cClassiebawn itself had been a fairly early example of what you might call English colonisation,\u201d says Ziegler. Hicks remembers the mountainside where \u201cthere was a big painted sign saying \u2018Brits go home\u2019. You arrive for your summer holiday and that\u2019s the welcome.\u201d The family had protection from the local police, but not to an excessive degree. The retelling of the blast itself \u2013 caused by a 50lb remote-controlled bomb planted the night before \u2013 was gut-wrenching. It was like a crack of thunder, recalls Mary Hornsey, the mother of 15-year-old Paul Maxwell, who had a summer job as Mountbatten\u2019s boat boy. \u201cI knew he was dead because I felt a part of me go.\u201d A few hours later, a bomb targeted an army convoy near Warrenpoint. Tom Caughey, one of just two survivors from the lorry that was hit, vividly describes gathering his strength to let his troop know he was still alive. They were doing, he says, \u201ca roll call of the dead\u201d. Half an hour later, another bomb went off by a gate lodge \u2013 the IRA unit rightly believed that was where the soldiers would regroup \u2013 taking the toll to 18. It was, says the company commander, Mike Jackson, with stiff upper lip understatement, \u201ca pretty grim sight\u201d, before going on to remember there were body parts in the trees. A civilian also died, shot by a soldier who wrongly believed he was involved in the attack. The feel of the IRA prisoners, remembers Anthony McIntyre, a former member who was in the Maze prison, was \u201cexuberance, exhilaration\u201d at the news. Olivia O\u2019Leary, a reporter at the Irish Times, puts it in context of the horrific events of Bloody Sunday seven years earlier. \u201cThere was a particular feeling of dislike towards the paratroopers,\u201d she says. But the targeting of Mountbatten and his family was different. \u201cAlmost everybody spoke with regret and shame about what had happened to Mountbatten,\u201d says O\u2019Leary. McIntyre, pointing out that senior IRA figures would have known children would have been on the boat, calls it a \u201cwar crime\u201d. There was nothing truly revelatory here, not even the fairly flat disclosure from Kieran Conway, the one-time director of intelligence for the IRA, that an assassination attempt on Mountbatten had been considered four years earlier. But there was plenty of genuine feeling. \u201cI wanted to be with them,\u201d says Caughey of his dead comrades. \u201cWhy did I survive?\u201d The grief of Maxwell\u2019s mother is almost unbearable to watch. In contrast is the weirdness of the upper classes. Hicks remembers being taken with her siblings into the castle\u2019s study and given pills to swallow. \u201cDear God. Would you give an 11-year-old Valium?\u201d she asks, incredulous. She was sent off to boarding school just a week after her grandfather\u2019s state funeral, where other girls made horrible jokes about his death. A clip of Prince Charles giving a speech about the murder of his mentor shows him reciting poetry instead of talking like a normal person. O\u2019Leary swiftly punctures his invocation of Yeats\u2019s line about peace \u201cdropping slow\u201d. \u201cPeace has to be worked at damn hard,\u201d she says. It is not, she says, \u201ca passive thing. It is always going to be a continuing responsibility on all of us in these islands to make sure that the conditions in Northern Ireland do not encourage the breakout again of sectarian tensions.\u201d Maddeningly, there are people now who need to be reminded of this.",

Toby Roland-Jones finished with five for 70. </p> <p>Rain ruined much of the day\u2019s play at Canterbury, where only 41 overs were possible. Mohammad Amir finished with four for 48 in his final red-ball game. The leaders <strong>Essex </strong>lost one wicket before the close in reply to <strong>Kent</strong>\u2019s 226. Meanwhile their closest rivals <strong>Somerset</strong> were struggling at Edgbaston. <strong>Warwickshire</strong> knocked up 419 despite Rob Yates adding only two to his overnight 139. Steve Davies provided the cowgum to the Somerset reply with an unbeaten 89 but parity lies far away. </p> <p>At the Oval Sam Curran was thrown in at No 3, without great success, as Fidel Edwards took two quick wickets. Earlier Rikki Clarke had finished with seven for 74 but there was frustration for <strong>Surrey</strong> from a ninth-wicket partnership of 119 between Ryan Stevenson and Kyle Abbott guiding <strong>Hampshire</strong> to 367.</p> <p><strong>Nottinghamshire</strong> came to rue <strong>Yorkshire</strong>\u2019s tail-end runs on Sunday after collapsing to 184 all out with four wickets for Duanne Olivier. Ferrety Adam Lyth and cubic Gary Ballance then piled on the agony with a partnership of 108 \u2013 giving Yorkshire a lead of 225 with eight wickets still in hand. </p> <p>Dane Vilas was the story of Division Two, dominating the <strong>Glamorgan</strong> attack with a remarkable 266 \u2013 the highest score by any <strong>Lancashire</strong> batsman at No 6. He sprayed the boards of Colwyn Bay with six sixes and 36 fours as Lancashire closed with a lead of 287. Keaton Jennings was the second highest scorer with a steady 86. </p> <p>On a Chester-le-Street featherbed <strong>Durham</strong> piled up 544 before declaring, with every man reaching double figures. <strong>Leicestershire</strong>\u2019s openers put on 100 before Paul Horton fell to Brydon Carse. Hassan Azad, owner of a new two-year contract, sleeps unbeaten on 53. <strong>Northamptonshire</strong>\u2019s Ben Sanderson grabbed four early-evening wickets as <strong>Worcestershire</strong>\u2019s top order again paraded their fragility, finishing on 42 for four \u2013 with Moeen Ali 10 not out. Northants had earlier rocked to 376 thanks to centuries from Dwaine Pretorius, on club debut, and Alex Wakely. After taking five wickets on Sunday Ryan Higgins hit a century against <strong>Derbyshire</strong> as <strong>Gloucestershire</strong> started practising the early steps of the promotion dance. Captain Chris Dent also made a hundred, 169, his fourth of the year.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d5aeb448f084061ab388ed9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-19T18:41:29.585Z\">7.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The mowers are circulating the ground here at Hove</strong>, with a - I won\u2019t say autumnal - freshness to the evening air.

Specifically, is there a single good reason for omitting the world\u2019s best keeper in favour of giving Bairstow the gloves? It recalls the Stewart/ Russell choice of days gone by, when the difference in batting average as keepers was only 7 and that between Stewart the keeper and Stewart the specialist batsman (and excellent all round fielder) 11 or 12. Although of course Stewart became a much better keeper than Bairstow as well as a better batsman and Foakes is better than Russell with both gloves and bat. </strong> </p> <p><em> In April my top seven would have been: Burns (who appeared not to have done anything wrong), another opener, Root, Bairstow, Stokes, Buttler, Foakes. I still think Bairstow is an underachieving batsmen who could be a high-quality international front line batsman and at the moment he is a very good No. 7 and a more than adequate wicket-keeper, but not great. I think he could be more valuable for England in a different position. My another opener in April would probably have been Jason Roy. As a bowler I didn\u2019t like to see batsmen hitting the ball back to me, and that\u2019s what I like to see in an opener. Would I continue with him? It\u2019s tricky, I think you have to give him a whirl but he does play the ball way out in front of him and he\u2019s got to understand that red ball cricket is different - you can\u2019t just go out there and hit it.

      "bodyText": "If Sunday\u2019s exploits were too much to beat, Ollie Robinson can sup on another good-sized mug of satisfaction after the Sussex paceman destroyed the stumps of two Middlesex batsmen \u2013 first Steve Eskinazi, then Paul Stirling \u2013 to reach 50 first-class wickets this season and collect his second 10-wicket haul against Middlesex this year. Sam Robson\u2019s fifty was the highlight of Middlesex\u2019s reply although they did improve on their first-innings 75 all out and were 149 for four at stumps, still 85 behind after Sussex had built up a sizeable first-innings lead thanks to some late-order biffing from Robinson and Will Beer (77). Toby Roland-Jones finished with five for 70. Rain ruined much of the day\u2019s play at Canterbury, where only 41 overs were possible. Mohammad Amir finished with four for 48 in his final red-ball game. The leaders Essex lost one wicket before the close in reply to Kent\u2019s 226. Meanwhile their closest rivals Somerset were struggling at Edgbaston. Warwickshire knocked up 419 despite Rob Yates adding only two to his overnight 139. Steve Davies provided the cowgum to the Somerset reply with an unbeaten 89 but parity lies far away. At the Oval Sam Curran was thrown in at No 3, without great success, as Fidel Edwards took two quick wickets. Earlier Rikki Clarke had finished with seven for 74 but there was frustration for Surrey from a ninth-wicket partnership of 119 between Ryan Stevenson and Kyle Abbott guiding Hampshire to 367. Nottinghamshire came to rue Yorkshire\u2019s tail-end runs on Sunday after collapsing to 184 all out with four wickets for Duanne Olivier. Ferrety Adam Lyth and cubic Gary Ballance then piled on the agony with a partnership of 108 \u2013 giving Yorkshire a lead of 225 with eight wickets still in hand. Dane Vilas was the story of Division Two, dominating the Glamorgan attack with a remarkable 266 \u2013 the highest score by any Lancashire batsman at No 6. He sprayed the boards of Colwyn Bay with six sixes and 36 fours as Lancashire closed with a lead of 287. Keaton Jennings was the second highest scorer with a steady 86. On a Chester-le-Street featherbed Durham piled up 544 before declaring, with every man reaching double figures. Leicestershire\u2019s openers put on 100 before Paul Horton fell to Brydon Carse. Hassan Azad, owner of a new two-year contract, sleeps unbeaten on 53. Northamptonshire\u2019s Ben Sanderson grabbed four early-evening wickets as Worcestershire\u2019s top order again paraded their fragility, finishing on 42 for four \u2013 with Moeen Ali 10 not out. Northants had earlier rocked to 376 thanks to centuries from Dwaine Pretorius, on club debut, and Alex Wakely. After taking five wickets on Sunday Ryan Higgins hit a century against Derbyshire as Gloucestershire started practising the early steps of the promotion dance. Captain Chris Dent also made a hundred, 169, his fourth of the year. The mowers are circulating the ground here at Hove, with a - I won\u2019t say autumnal - freshness to the evening air. Some happy days today- for Rikki Clarke, Toby Roland-Jones, Dwaine Pretorius, Alex Wakely, Ben Sanderson, Alex Higgins, Chris Dent, Duanne Olivier and Warwickshire\u2019s George Garrett and Sussex\u2019s Elliot Hooper who both claimed a wicket on their first-class debut. But the largest glass of something delicious is raised to Dane Vilas, who made the highest score ever by a Lancashire No.6. What a treat for those in the deckchairs at Colwyn Bay. That\u2019s it from me today - hotfooting it to The Oval tomorrow. Have a lovely evening - good night! A wicket here in a game that is meandering towards a third day. Middx 77 for two. I\u2019d better concentrate on writing up now. Just to say Vilas has thundered past 220... And a picture of four old Guardian cricket writers at one ground. Perhaps not the day to borrow Charlene\u2019s dungarees... And 200! What an innings from the big man. Lancs 455 for seven. Vilas in the nervous 199s... Adam Lyth splatters Patterson-White for six. Yorkies 83-1 already a lead of 131. Would it be harsh to say that\u2019s probably enough? Division two: Chris Dent keeps on rolling, 110 not out, as Gloucestershire lead by 63 runs. Leicestershire carrying on where Durham left off, 67 for 0 on a Chester le Street featherbed. Dane Vilas - wowing Colwyn Bay- 181 including five whalloping sixes. Lancashire a bonus-point tastic 415 for six. It is raining at The County Ground and Middx sticking not twisting here at Hove. Quick round- up: Div one- Nick Browne gone for 6 as Essex stutter to 10/1 in reply to Kent\u2019s 226. Surrey off the mark at The Oval after bowling Kent out for 367 (Clarke 7-73); oh bloody hell Somerset, 58 for 3, Davies hanging on 31 not out. Essex could go clear here. And Yorkies rocking and rolling at 64-0. Tea here at Hove - lots of people on the field, kids running around, the usual cohort reading the runes of the pitch, even a handful of teenagers. Middx 36 for one, with a way to go. Incidentally Sussex have the highest occupancy rate (percentage of seats sold) for Blast games of all counties other than Surrey. So did you hear the joke of the Edinburgh Festival? \u201cI keep randomly shouting out \u2018Broccoli\u2019 and \u2018Cauliflower\u2019 - I think I might have florets\u201d. Your favourite cricket joke? Middlesex\u2019s first innings batting? -ba-boom Apologies, it\u2019s very remiss of me but I\u2019ve somehow missed Dwaine Pretorius getting a century on debut for Northants. Sorry Dwaine. It came off 136 balls and included two slog-sweeps for six off Moeen. Northants did however somehow miss out on a fourth batting point. Something in the air this round for the shoulder-heavy man mountains - Rikki Clarke has seven for 74 now at The Oval. Middlesex weathering the storm at the moment. At tea, Lancashire have a lead of 77 with the mighty Dane Vilas carrying the red rose on both shoulders. 134 not out, in just under three hours. A hush has settled over the ground as Robinson runs in.. Eskinazi starts the ball rolling by smashing Robinson for four off his second ball. And - gosh, involuntary squeak - Robinson\u2019s bowled him with his third, stumps demolished, stamped upon, crushed. Middlesex 4/1. Um... Farewell leg stump: Will Beer bowled for a rather magnificent 77 - 13 fours and a six - and Sussex are all out for 309 - a lead of 234. TRJ 5-70. A groundsman lovingly brushes the pitch with a red-headed broom, with dust billowing behind. It is blowy out there, the trees surrounding the ground shake hither and thither. Robinson has the ball and is warming up. WOW - Durham!!! 544 for nine dec. Only one century - though it was a daddy from Lees - but contributions from top to tail. That scoreboard in full: Warwicks all out 419; let\u2019s see what Somerset can do now. Oh, and Notts all out too, 184 - a deficit of 48. Middlesex have taken the new ball, but Sussex continue to thrash about: 252 for nine. Ouch, there is a man down here at Hove. Steven Finn fielding in the deep misread a whallop from Beer at mid-off and seems to nudge it into his face. The physios run on - ah good, he\u2019s up but walking off for treatment. Now, what\u2019s happening at Scarborough? Ah, it\u2019s raining. But Notts are stumbling a little - 179 for eight. Tom Moores 48 not out. Next to me Bruce Talbot is doing the groundwork for his book with Ian Gould due to come out next spring. Prepare for some straight-talking from the five foot six motor mouth. An email! From David Malcolm It seems to take ages to restart games even after short rain breaks. The slow removal of the covers followed by umpires taking their time to inspect the ground. No urgency. I have been to baseball games in the US where they get on with it quickly even after heavy rain. Why not in cricket? I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll have to make do with me David as Selv has disappeared to put his feet up and rumble over a three course meal. I\u2019ve never been to baseball but I would guess it is because the \u2018pitch\u2019 isn\u2019t important in baseball and the batter runs round on sand/gravel not grass They\u2019re between innings at Canterbury - Kent eventually all out for 226, with the last two wickets putting on 88 - which is something of a theme this round. Harry Podmore finished 54 not out; Sam Cook five for 42. Here he is: And here is Amir - unbelievably playing his last red ball match. And a bit of news from Northants - Nathan Buck was pulled out of the game against Worcestershire this morning with concussion after being hit on the head by Josh Tongue last night. He has been replaced by Blessing Muzarabani. The sea was a melancholy mixture of grey and beige - and at 250 for 8 there is a chance, if Ollie Robinson gets his bowling wheels on again, that this could be over tonight. BAM! Beer whallops Harris. DIVISION ONE Canterbury: Kent 211-9 (Amir 4-48; Cook 4-42) v Essex. Rain delay - play due to restart at 1.40. The Oval: Surrey v Hampshire 327-8 (Vince 47; Abbot 55 not out; Clarke 6-66). Edgbaston: Warwickshire 384-7 (Rhodes 82, Yates 141; Brooks 3-98) v Somerset. Scarborough: Yorkshire 232 (Tattersall 92; Luke Wood 5-67 ) v Nottinghamshire 131-6 DIVISION TWO Derby: Derbyshire 200 (Higgins 5-54 ) v Gloucestershire 128-3 (Dent 52 not out) Chester-le-Street: Durham 461-8 (Alex Lees 181 ) v Leicestershire Colwyn Bay: Glamorgan 257 (Hemphrey 56, Patel 54, Carey 51) v Lancashire 191-4 (Jennings 77 not out) County Ground: Worcestershire 186 (Moeen 42, Leach 53; Hutton 6-57) v Northants 257-3 (Wakely 101 not out) Hove: Sussex 232-7 (Wells 62, Carey 56; Roland-Jones 5-56) v Middlesex 75 (Robinson 8-34) Rain has curtailed things at The Oval and Canterbury for now. Somerset fighting back at Edgbaston - Warwickshire now 338-7 - three for Brooks and three for the Overtons. Notts! This was your chance. Now 125 for five at Scarborough. Three for Olivier, two for Coad and Maharaj has just bowled Ben Duckett, who had just hit him for six. And Steven Finn is being thrashed round the ground by Sussex. . Robinson hit him for 18 off nine balls. Sussex 198 for seven. Good morning TanyaI was hoping you might be able to elicit Magnum PI\u2019s view of the Foakes question. Specifically, is there a single good reason for omitting the world\u2019s best keeper in favour of giving Bairstow the gloves? It recalls the Stewart/ Russell choice of days gone by, when the difference in batting average as keepers was only 7 and that between Stewart the keeper and Stewart the specialist batsman (and excellent all round fielder) 11 or 12. Although of course Stewart became a much better keeper than Bairstow as well as a better batsman and Foakes is better than Russell with both gloves and bat. In April my top seven would have been: Burns (who appeared not to have done anything wrong), another opener, Root, Bairstow, Stokes, Buttler, Foakes. I still think Bairstow is an underachieving batsmen who could be a high-quality international front line batsman and at the moment he is a very good No. 7 and a more than adequate wicket-keeper, but not great. I think he could be more valuable for England in a different position. My another opener in April would probably have been Jason Roy. As a bowler I didn\u2019t like to see batsmen hitting the ball back to me, and that\u2019s what I like to see in an opener. Would I continue with him? It\u2019s tricky, I think you have to give him a whirl but he does play the ball way out in front of him and he\u2019s got to understand that red ball cricket is different - you can\u2019t just go out there and hit it. Ben Stokes has adjusted - it is possible. Selv has now left the building. Thanks for all your questions! Given certain counties\u2019 propensity to sign other counties\u2019 talent (yes i\u2019m looking at you , Notts), is there an argument to introduce transfer fees by way of compensation? Yes. Or at least to make sure that counties are better compensated for that process. And it is not unreasonable for some counties to now consider themselves the game\u2019s nurseries - and that\u2019s not a bad thing. I have immense respect for Worcestershire for example. But at the same time you can\u2019t impede people\u2019s ambition and progress anymore - it is not feudal like it used to be. Lord Selve\u2019s views on the new England quick would be great but if that\u2019s not on then how about his gravy recipe? We had a discussion a few years back here about gravy and the making of it. I think Busfield was here and his Ma had a recipe too. I saw Jofra Archer\u2019s first game here at Hove, one of the last games I did for the Guardian - and if you read it [see below] you\u2019ll see what I thought three years ago. And since then, I got in touch with George Bailey at the Hobart Hurricanes two years ago and he said he was a superstar. I said how\u2019s he bowling compared to Tymal Mills? And he said - he\u2019s faster. And then in December last year I wrote a piece saying that irrespective of who he played for it was doing cricket a disservice that someone of his ability was being made to waste the best years of his life through an arcane qualification process. I didn\u2019t care who he played for but the game could ill afford to lose talent like that. [HE LOVES HIM - ed] My household is vegetarian bordering on vegan these days and last night we had a really nice spagetti bolognese made with quorn. I\u2019m very much enjoying vegetarian and vegan dishes these days. Two wickets have fallen here while I was doing Selv\u2019s Q&amp;A. Carey drove across a TRJ half volley and was caught for 56, and Luke Wells chipped TRJ to midwicket. That\u2019s four for Roland-Jones, four MORE for Roland-Jones - and Middlesex are back in it. Even more so now as Ben Brown has a backfoot slash off Murtagh. Sussex 151 for 6. Does he remember a player called Paul Hennessy who played for Middlesex\u2019s under 16s in 2005? He took 3 for 27 yesterday (for Spain). No, I was a bit out of the loop for a while - but well done! Fifty for Jet Jennings. And another.... How is Stuey Law doing in elevating the Middle Saxons up the CC2 table? What has or could be improved? We\u2019re not getting enough first-innings runs. We\u2019re relying very heavily on Dawid - this is the sort of game where Dawid thinks he\u2019d going to do it again and that\u2019s not fair We\u2019ve got a quality bowling attack, but when you\u2019re defending 75 it\u2019s not that easy for them. Stuart and Nic Pothas are doing a good job and are still trying to find things that work, who they like, who are team players . We\u2019re trying to build a corporate spirit where the team comes first - which is really important. We\u2019ve got a couple of young players who haven\u2019t kicked on - Max Holden, Sterlo\u2019s not had a cracker, I think he\u2019s due, Steve Eskinazi has played ok, Dawid\u2019s played brilliantly. He\u2019s playing as well as anyone else at the moment - if England aren\u2019t looking at him it is a travesty. And rain has stopped play at Edgbaston with Warwickshire 313 for five. I\u2019ve just interrupted Hoppsy and Selv arguing about The Hundred just like old times, to ask a few of your questions BTL. I\u2019d like to ask about what the London clubs are doing to sell out one T20 after another, when tickets are proving harder to shift in some other parts of the country. It\u2019s not prices and it\u2019s probably not just weather. I can\u2019t speak for other parts of the country (five sell outs out of seven at Hove interjects Bruce Talbot) but we play good T20 cricket, AB has helped a bit - a bit of spike when he arrived. The two sell outs at Lord\u2019s have been home counties - Essex and Surrey. A couple of wickets have fallen already at Colwyn Bay - both Josh Bohannon and Liam Livingstone fall to Michael Hogan. Lancashire now 93-3. Some cracking talking points from Gary Naylor. Ah, what a shame, Yates makes only another two before being dismissed by Brooks. What a waste of a night\u2019s sleep. And we have the Middlesex president in the box at the moment, looking very Magnum PI. Do send any questions BTL: he promises to answer. Other news: Good news for Leicestershire: DIVISION ONE Canterbury: Kent 125-6 (Amir 3-30; Cook 3-25) v Essex. The Oval: Surrey v Hampshire 222-7 (Vince 47; Clarke 5-52). Edgbaston: Warwickshire 303-4 (Rhodes 82, Yates 139 not out) v Somerset. Scarborough: Yorkshire 232 (Tattersall 92; Luke Wood 5-67 ) v Nottinghamshire 41-0 DIVISION TWO Derby: Derbyshire 200 (Higgins 5-54 ) v Gloucestershire 46-2 Chester-le-Street: Durham 368-5 (Alex Lees 181) v Leicestershire Colwyn Bay: Glamorgan 257 (Hemphrey 56, Patel 54, Carey 51) v Lancashire 85-1 County Ground: Worcestershire 186 (Moeen 42, Leach 53; Hutton 6-57) v Northants 140-3 (Wakely 63) Hove: Sussex 128-3 (Wells 52 not out, Carey 46 not out) v Middlesex 75 (Robinson 8-34) Good morning from gorgeous Hove - or gorgeous-ish Hove, it is now raining: a squall, I think. The hedgerow are embarrassingly verdant, the gulls are crying and I\u2019m wondering how much one of those lovely victorian villas would set me back. The last time I covered a match in Hove was when Sussex won the Championship in 2003, just after I got back from my honeymoon incidentally, when there was a queue out of the ground and down the road. No such queues today, but the usual loyal scattering cagouled and sandwiched for the day. Ollie Robinson awakes a hero \u2013 tipped by his teammate Chris Jordan as a potential England player \u2013 of the line and length mould rather than Wood/Archer. Yesterday\u2019s figures of 8 for 34 are the best by a Sussex bowler at Hove since 1955. Ted James anyone? Sussex resume today in the driving seat \u2013 Luke Wells has fifty and Australian Alex Carey, making his Championship debut, has 46. Round the grounds: teenage sensation Rob Yates bats on for Warwickshire after a bad day for Somerset; Nottinghamshire aim for at least parity in the search for their first Championship win of the season after letting Yorkshire off the hook; Rikki Clarke kept Hampshire on their toes at The Oval; and Essex and Kent hope for better weather at Canterbury. Northants are on top against Worcestershire; Alex Lees has batted Durham into a strong position at Chester le Street against Leicestershire with a sublime century; Ryan Higgins\u2019 five for 54 puts Gloucestershire in control at the County Ground and the intriguing game between the Division two leaders continues at Colwyn Bay.",

A video purportedly shows around 10 members of the boys\u2019 water polo team at Pacifica high school in Garden Grove, Orange county, giving the salute while facing a figure at a lectern who is saluting and singing. According to the Daily Beast, which published the video, the incident occurred before an awards ceremony late last year. The website reported that the song is an obscure Nazi marching song from the second world war. The video was reportedly shared on Instagram by a student, who allegedly also posted lyrics to the song in his bio on the social network, which he later removed. It is the second incident involving Nazi depictions and high school students in Orange county to come to national attention this year.

The Garden Grove Unified school district, which oversees Pacifica high school, said both organizations \u201cstrongly condemn\u201d the video, which it said was \u201crecorded last year of some students who engaged in offensive Nazi-related gestures\u201d.

The something in question is director and sound-effects operator <a href=\"http://www.zachandviggo.com/jonny\">Jonny Woolley</a>, effectively the other half of an on stage/off stage double act.</p> <p>Way beyond the boom-tish you might expect, there is a range of sounds and samples tailored to Tucker\u2019s every comment, punchline and flirtatious wink. A burst of bagpipes greets each mention of Edinburgh; at every callback, a phone rings; there\u2019s a blast of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/24/lenny-kravitz-on-30-years-in-music-people-take-your-kindness-for-weakness\">Lenny Kravitz</a>\u2019s American Woman when Tucker thinks he has struck comedy gold, at which points his red-ringed eyes light up and he swells with pride.

He offers us lukewarm takes on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Trump</a>, smartphones, and the clitoris \u2013 one among many words (and names, and places) he struggles to pronounce. There are sob stories about his recent divorce, switching on a dime with priapic \u201cI was fucking my wife the other day\u201d standup.</p> <p>The point isn\u2019t to play the reality of a Tucker gig. As the ever-changing age of his son (from infant to pensioner and back) implies, we\u2019re taking a trip into the recesses of a glitching mind, where comedy\u2019s dwindling endorphin rush struggles to keep desolation at bay. The show flits between the standup and melancholy reveries (dry ice, sad piano) triggered by whatever heckles or walkouts come Zucker\u2019s way. It has little new to say about hack comics and (what\u2019s always assumed to be) their bleak lives. But when Zucker and Woolley improvise together, pinging set-ups and sound stings back and forth while their late-night crowd goes wild, it\u2019s more than fun enough to compensate.</p> <p>\u2022 At <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/jack-tucker-comedy-stand-up-hour\">Underbelly Cowgate, Edinburgh</a>, until 25 August.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/edinburgh-festival-2019+tone/reviews\">Read all our Edinburgh festival reviews</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The hack comic is such a mainstay of drama and caricature \u2013 from Osborne\u2019s Entertainer via Neil Hamburger to Zoe Coombs Marr\u2019s Dave \u2013 the concept is practically hack itself. You need something to distinguish yourself from the herd, and Zach Zucker (of clown duo Zach and Viggo) certainly has with this new show in character as a washed-up American standup, Jack Tucker. The something in question is director and sound-effects operator Jonny Woolley, effectively the other half of an on stage/off stage double act. Way beyond the boom-tish you might expect, there is a range of sounds and samples tailored to Tucker\u2019s every comment, punchline and flirtatious wink. A burst of bagpipes greets each mention of Edinburgh; at every callback, a phone rings; there\u2019s a blast of Lenny Kravitz\u2019s American Woman when Tucker thinks he has struck comedy gold, at which points his red-ringed eyes light up and he swells with pride. Maybe the big time is not beyond him, after all? It is. Because \u2013 shabby of suit, flies gaping, more rumpled than a doss-house duvet \u2013 Tucker is a never-was struggling to upgrade to a has-been. He offers us lukewarm takes on Trump, smartphones, and the clitoris \u2013 one among many words (and names, and places) he struggles to pronounce. There are sob stories about his recent divorce, switching on a dime with priapic \u201cI was fucking my wife the other day\u201d standup. The point isn\u2019t to play the reality of a Tucker gig. As the ever-changing age of his son (from infant to pensioner and back) implies, we\u2019re taking a trip into the recesses of a glitching mind, where comedy\u2019s dwindling endorphin rush struggles to keep desolation at bay. The show flits between the standup and melancholy reveries (dry ice, sad piano) triggered by whatever heckles or walkouts come Zucker\u2019s way. It has little new to say about hack comics and (what\u2019s always assumed to be) their bleak lives. But when Zucker and Woolley improvise together, pinging set-ups and sound stings back and forth while their late-night crowd goes wild, it\u2019s more than fun enough to compensate. \u2022 At Underbelly Cowgate, Edinburgh, until 25 August. \u2022 Read all our Edinburgh festival reviews.",

We are now focused on doing all that we can to support the children, young people, their families and carers, and the many caring and dedicated staff who are affected during this difficult time.\u201d Ofsted later said it was confident it made the right decision. \u201cThat is because in July we were made aware of new significant concerns about child cruelty, which now form part of a major ongoing police investigation. We only take such decisions to suspend children\u2019s homes registrations when there is a reasonable belief that any children may be at risk of harm \u2013 this test is set out in law. The decision was also taken after strategy meetings with other agencies, which shared our concerns. \u201cWe understand the distress this caused to the families involved, but it is important that we take swift action where we have serious concerns about children\u2019s safety. When children\u2019s homes close it is up to local authorities to find suitable accommodation for children in care, and we always work with them during this process.\u201d According to Ofsted, St Christopher\u2019s school has been inspected seven times since it was registered in 2016 and has never been graded better than \u201crequires improvement\u201d. In June, it was inspected and judged to be inadequate for a second consecutive time. \u201cFollowing this inspection we took steps to restrict more placements at the home and served a notice of proposal to cancel registration. Following the decision to suspend, St Christopher\u2019s school did not appeal the decision and chose to voluntarily cancel its registration.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Plans to end freedom of movement for EU citizens immediately after a no-deal Brexit have caused anxiety and confusion among European nationals in the UK, with concerns they could be caught up in hostile environment policies. Downing Street confirmed rules allowing EU nationals to live and work freely in the UK would end abruptly if the UK leaves the bloc without an agreement at the end of October. In theory, the rights of EU citizens who have permanent residence in the UK should not be affected and they will continue to be allowed to apply for settled status \u2013 granted once they have lived in the UK for five years \u2013 until the end of December 2020. However, news of a possible sharp end to free movement without the transition period envisaged under Theresa May\u2019s administration provoked concern about how at least 2.6 million EU nationals who have yet to apply for settled status would prove they are in the UK legally. The3million, which represents EU nationals in the UK, said plans by the home secretary, Priti Patel, to impose new border restrictions overnight on 31 October if Britain leaves the EU without a deal were \u201creckless\u201d. Nicolas Hatton, a co-founder of the group, said: \u201cEnding freedom of movement without putting legal provisions in place for those EU citizens who have not yet successfully applied through the settlement scheme will mean that millions of lawful citizens will have their legal status removed overnight.\u201d Concerns were heightened with the leak of an internal government discussion paper warning introducing a sharp cutoff date could present \u201clegitimate concerns of another Windrush\u201d. Since March, 1 million EU nationals have successfully applied for settled status, giving them the right to live in the UK after Brexit. Some of those who have yet to apply are worried about their right to NHS treatment or employment being questioned. Some are also concerned about how they would prove they have the right to live in the UK if they travel abroad. Stephanie Dawoud, a spokeswoman for Imix, an immigration communications charity, said: \u201cThe fear is that the hostile environment will be applied to EU citizens who are living here legitimately. There is no system in place to distinguish between the people who have been living in the UK before Brexit and someone who has arrived on 1 November. \u201cIt will be up to employers, the NHS and landlords to check whether someone has the right to be here or not. It is another announcement that feeds into the worst fears of EU citizens in the UK.\u201d Some EU nationals have not applied for settled status because the digital application process is yet to be available on iPhones, although this should be resolved before the end of the year. Campaign groups say large numbers of people who are required to apply for settled status are still unaware they need to do so. There was dismay about the absence of clear information about what kind of documents people might need to take with them if they were to travel abroad, returning after 31 October. Gregorio Benincasa, an Italian citizen living in the UK who has yet to apply for settled status, said: \u201cAre we expected to carry reams of documentation proving that we\u2019ve built a life in the UK over the last decade? Will border guards be responsible for reviewing our employment contracts and utility bills to prove our status?\u201d Christian Wuff, a finance project analyst who has been in the UK since arriving as a student from Norway, said: \u201cThis is very scary stuff. What if I need a new bank account, a new mortgage, a new job? I\u2019ve been here 19 years without ever having to show anything other than my passport. Now I\u2019m having to apply to stay in my own home.\u201d The Home Office urged EU nationals to apply for settled status to avoid potential difficulties. Officials said no one eligible for the status would be barred from re-entering the UK if and when free movement ended, but it was not clear how checks would be made. Under May\u2019s government, there was an acceptance the new immigration system and border controls would not be ready for an immediate change, so a transition phase was envisaged until they were put in place. This now appears to have been dropped. The Conservative MP Alberto Costa, a campaigner for EU citizens\u2019 rights, said: \u201cThe government are creating deep confusion as to what will happen. No details have been given on how the government would distinguish between the rights of EU nationals lawfully in the UK pre-Brexit from those who come into the country after 31 October.\u201d He said he was concerned about the lack of detail from the Home Office. \u201cIs there going to be a total block on all EU nationals coming into the country post-Brexit? Or will all lawfully resident EU nationals be expected to show some form of settled status evidence? What about the 2.6 million people who have not yet registered?\u201d Costa asked. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do this correctly, it\u2019s not just about lorry queues on the road to Dover, it\u2019s about denying people their basic rights \u2013 rights to reside, rights to healthcare, rights to pensions.\u201d Costa also warned of a reciprocal sharp end to free movement for the 1.3 million British citizens living in other EU nations. \u201cTheir rights would also end abruptly. It is unclear how the British government would protect their rights,\u201d he said. A Home Office spokesperson said further details were being worked on and would be announced shortly. \u201cEU citizens and their families still have until at least December 2020 to apply to the EU settlement scheme and 1 million people have already been granted status,\u201d they said. \u201cFreedom of movement as it currently stands will end on 31 October when the UK leaves the EU, and after Brexit the government will introduce a new, fairer immigration system that prioritises skills and what people can contribute to the UK, rather than where they come from.\u201d In a sign of further confusion over the government\u2019s policy, a senior Whitehall source said the only change that had so far been confirmed by the Home Office was additional criminal record checks on those entering the UK, while other potential changes were still being assessed. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone is leaning in to the fact that there will be a spanking new system in place,\u201d the source said. \u201cThe change is a symbolic gesture towards the many voters who supported Brexit because they wished to stop the free flow of people into the UK. \u201cThe home secretary and the PM think that ending freedom of movement is an integral part of taking back control.

      "bodyText": "Journalists and camera crews are coming under attack on \u201can increased basis\u201d from far-right activists, and police need to take a strategic approach to dealing with the growing problem, according to the head of the National Union of Journalists. The union\u2019s general secretary, Michelle Stanistreet, called on law enforcement agencies to do more to tackle what she described as a \u201ccoordinated surge in violent extremism against journalists and media workers\u201d as British politics has become more polarised since the EU referendum. NUJ officials met the Met police in March, calling for officers to intervene more proactively when journalists are harassed or attacked at demonstrations and other public events, but the union believes that there has been little improvement. Over the weekend the Guardian columnist Owen Jones was attacked by a group of men outside a pub at 2am in central London when he was out celebrating his birthday. He believes he was targeted for his high-profile leftwing views. There have been a string of other incidents in recent months. James Goddard, a notorious self-styled \u201cyellow vest\u201d activist, was convicted in June for the common assault of a photographer, Joel Goodman, in Manchester in February. At one point Goddard had told the photographer: \u201cWhen there\u2019s no police around here, I\u2019m going to take your head off your shoulders.\u201d Goodman, a photojournalist, told the Guardian that he had become a target for far-right demonstrators, after it was wrongly suggested he worked with the anti-fascist group Hope not Hate. Threats routinely arrive by \u201cphone, email and text\u201d, he said. \u201cPhotographers have been bearing the brunt of this for some time \u2013 thank you for noticing us. It has undeniably got worse, and although I\u2019m loth to say it, Brexit emboldened a lot of hostile attitudes,\u201d Goodman added. Goddard first came to public attention after he was filmed abusing the anti-Brexit MP Anna Soubry, calling her a Nazi and traitor, chasing her down the street just a few yards from parliament. After pleading guilty to harassing her in July, Goddard was filmed emerging from court promising that journalists who had written \u201chit pieces about me\u201d would get \u201cprotested against\u201d and that such reporters were \u201ctraitors to this country\u201d. Journalists covering Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, complained of intimidation from his followers during his contempt of court trial in the early summer. At one point during the hearings a BBC camera crew outside the Old Bailey in central London were attacked and forced to leave by Robinson supporters, who branded them \u201cBBC paedo scum\u201d, and \u201cfake news wankers\u201d. Dominic Casciani, the BBC\u2019s home affairs correspondent, wrote last month: \u201cAt every hearing in this saga, journalists have been abused. People have been spat at, had cameras attacked.

The \u201cTommy Robinson News\u201d encrypted Telegram Messenger account \u2013 which has more than 50,000 subscribers \u2013 is one place where vitriolic criticisms are aired frequently. Posters routinely accuse Jones of \u201ctreachery\u201d and threaten violence. Vitriol is also directed against a female journalist who has covered the far-right leader\u2019s activities. The account, which regularly posted self-shot videos of Robinson addressing his supporters before he was jailed for contempt of court last month, is understood to have been run by the far-right activist and his inner circle. Jason Parkinson, a freelance cameraman who routinely covers far-right demonstrations and events, says that while there has always been anti-media aggression among the far right, the number of those prepared to act has grown. \u201cThere\u2019s been a change in mood; the numbers of people prepared to be angry or aggressive have increased.

The assault against the Guardian columnist Owen Jones left him asking the same question. \u201cI\u2019m just a symptom of a wider phenomenon, an emboldened, increasingly violent far right,\u201d said Jones. All the official evidence suggests far-right violence is on the rise across the UK. At least four far-right terror plots were foiled by the police and security services last year and, for the first time, the threat from extreme rightwing and leftwing terrorism will be reflected in the official threat level.

For the first time, a similar percentage of individuals received support from the Channel scheme for concerns related to Islamist and rightwing extremism.

Of the 394 individuals who received Channel support, 179 or 45% were referred for concerns related to Islamist extremism and 174 or 44% were referred for concerns related to rightwing extremism. Since 2018, MI5 has taken on an enhanced role in the fight against far-right terror groups, which it had previously left to the police. The most high-profile cases of far-right violence in recent years were the murder of the MP Jo Cox by the white supremacist Thomas Mair and the foiled plot to kill the MP Rosie Cooper by Jack Renshaw, a former member of the banned group National Action. But there have been numerous cases in the courts in the past year with far-right links. The most serious examples include Vincent Fuller, who is to be sentenced for attempted murder next month after admitting to stabbing a Bulgarian teenager in a Tesco car park in Surrey in a racially aggravated attack. Last month, Tristan Morgan, a far-right extremist from Devon, admitted attempting to burn down a synagogue, and two teenage neo-Nazis who encouraged terror attacks on targets including Prince Harry were jailed in June.

      "bodyText": "On Wednesday the most senior Catholic cleric to be convicted of child sexual abuse, Cardinal George Pell, will find out if his appeal has succeeded and if he will be released from custody. The 78-year-old has been in Melbourne assessment prison since being sentenced in March to six years in prison for sexually abusing two 13-year-old choirboys in 1996 when he was the archbishop of Melbourne. He was ordered to serve a non-parole period of three years and eight months. The jurors heard Pell sexually assaulted the two boys after Sunday solemn mass at St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in Melbourne in the priest\u2019s sacristy. Pell orally raped one of the boys during this incident and indecently assaulted both of them. Pell offended a second time against one of the boys one month later, when he grabbed the boy\u2019s genitals in a church corridor, once more after Sunday solemn mass. He was convicted on four counts of an indecent act with a child under the age of 16 and one count of sexual penetration with a child under the age of 16. Pell\u2019s appeal was heard in June before a full bench of the supreme court including the chief justice, Anne Ferguson, the president of the court of appeal, Chris Maxwell, and Mark Weinberg. Only two of the three judges needs to agree as to whether Pell\u2019s conviction should be overturned. Pell\u2019s high-profile appeal barrister Bret Walker appealed Pell\u2019s conviction on three grounds, with the first ground \u2013 that the jury was unreasonable in reaching its verdict \u2013 the most likely to succeed. However, the unreasonable threshold is a high one to meet. The appellate judges have to find that the jurors must have had a reasonable doubt as to Pell\u2019s guilt, not just that they could have. Walker argued there was a \u201cformidable list\u201d of factors and events that needed to line up for the offending to be possible, and that the jury would have had to believe every one of those factors had occurred. If the judges agree, Pell could walk free from the court on Wednesday. If Walker fails to convince the court that Pell\u2019s conviction should be overturned on grounds of unreasonableness, he will hope to have succeeded on one of the two other grounds of appeal. One being that Pell was not arraigned in the presence of the jury panel \u2013 because there were so many potential jurors, they were split between the main court room and an overflow room with a video link established between the court and jurors. The other being that Pell\u2019s defence team should have been allowed to show a video animation of its argument during the closing address, which the judge presiding over the case, chief justice Peter Kidd, deemed inadmissible. Kidd refused to allow the animation as he said the jurors may view it as factual evidence, and new evidence can not be introduced during closing addresses. Even if the appellant judges agree that these were errors, they would need to find that the errors were so egregious that they could have affected the jury verdict in order for Pell\u2019s appeal to succeed. If the judges accept the appeal on either of these grounds a retrial would be the most likely result, rather than Pell\u2019s conviction being overturned.

      "body": "<p>The latest labour force figures released by the bureau of statistics have served to reinforce that the economy is showing a severe case of wobbles. While there remain some signs that a recession is coming our way, the labour market is holding up. But the drop in the growth of hours worked is a serious concern, especially given it means underemployment is unlikely to improve.</p> <p>Things can go downhill fast. A month ago, on 19 July, the market was pricing in a cut in the cash rate to 0.75% and a good chance of a further cut to 0.5%. Now it is fully pricing in that cut to happen by early next year and is predicting a 50:50 chance of another cut to 0.25% within 12 months:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Market expectations of the RBA cash rate\">  <iframe title=\"Market expectations of the RBA cash rate\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Pkp7m/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>What has also happened in the past month is that the bond market yield curve, echoing what has happened in the US, has gone negative \u2013 meaning that the interest rate the government pays for bonds that are for five years is lower than the rate for borrowing for two years.</p> <p>It means that the market thinks interest rates in five years time will be lower than they will be in two years, and that is generally a sign of the economy slowing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2019/aug/18/accepting-anecdotes-more-readily-than-climate-science-is-wilful-ignorance\">Accepting anecdotes more readily than climate science is wilful ignorance | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the past that has been a very good indicator that a recession is on the way.</p> <p>The yield curve went negative earlier this year just prior to the budget.

A number of commentators have suggested the difference between the negative yield curve this time and in the past is that employment is generally holding up well and that the negative sentiment is mostly a factor of having a madman in the White House who thinks trade wars are fun and easy.</p> <p>But still, you would rather the market believes that interest rates will rise over the next five years than fall.</p> <p>And there are signs that the labour market is not as good as the employment growth might suggest.</p> <p>I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2019/jul/23/lets-not-get-too-excited-the-drop-in-underemployment-is-just-a-statistical-flub\">predicted last month</a> that the June fall in the underemployment rate was mostly a statistical anomaly due to a big drop in Victoria and that it would be corrected this month:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Monthly growth of underemployment (seasonally adjusted)\">  <iframe title=\"Monthly growth of underemployment (seasonally adjusted)\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/uZBxf/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The Victorian underemployment rate, in seasonally adjusted terms, has gone in three months from 8.4% to 9.4% to 7.9% to 8.5%.

      "bodyText": "The latest labour force figures released by the bureau of statistics have served to reinforce that the economy is showing a severe case of wobbles. While there remain some signs that a recession is coming our way, the labour market is holding up. But the drop in the growth of hours worked is a serious concern, especially given it means underemployment is unlikely to improve. Things can go downhill fast. A month ago, on 19 July, the market was pricing in a cut in the cash rate to 0.75% and a good chance of a further cut to 0.5%. Now it is fully pricing in that cut to happen by early next year and is predicting a 50:50 chance of another cut to 0.25% within 12 months: What has also happened in the past month is that the bond market yield curve, echoing what has happened in the US, has gone negative \u2013 meaning that the interest rate the government pays for bonds that are for five years is lower than the rate for borrowing for two years. It means that the market thinks interest rates in five years time will be lower than they will be in two years, and that is generally a sign of the economy slowing. In the past that has been a very good indicator that a recession is on the way. The yield curve went negative earlier this year just prior to the budget. There did seem to be an improvement in sentiment after the election but that has now all evaporated: Now this does not mean we will have a recession. A number of commentators have suggested the difference between the negative yield curve this time and in the past is that employment is generally holding up well and that the negative sentiment is mostly a factor of having a madman in the White House who thinks trade wars are fun and easy. But still, you would rather the market believes that interest rates will rise over the next five years than fall. And there are signs that the labour market is not as good as the employment growth might suggest. I predicted last month that the June fall in the underemployment rate was mostly a statistical anomaly due to a big drop in Victoria and that it would be corrected this month: The Victorian underemployment rate, in seasonally adjusted terms, has gone in three months from 8.4% to 9.4% to 7.9% to 8.5%. This just serves to remind everyone not to get too excited about monthly changes in the seasonally adjusted rate and to stick with the trend. But even here we are seeing a turn for the worse. A month ago the trend national underemployment rate was 8.3% and falling, now it is 8.4%. It certainly suggests the picture of the past three months is worse than we previously thought: And a big sign that things are not going all that well is the collapse in the growth of hours worked. In July, the total number of hours worked by all employees was just 0.03% above that in June \u2013 the worst monthly growth for 18 months \u2013 and shows a divergence with the level of employment growth: What this suggests is that jobs growth in recent times has been more for part-time work than full-time and that there has also been a slight shift of full-time employees into part-time work. That in itself may not be an awful thing, but while it is better for people to have reduced hours than to lose their job entirely, the worry is that generally the growth of hours worked and employment moves in sync. So if the slowdown in hours worked continues, job growth is likely to slow as well: But it is clear that part-time work, especially for men, is outpacing the growth in full-time employment, and it reflects the decade-long trend. We are now, astonishingly, almost at a point where the percentage of adults in employment is as high as it was prior to the GFC. In June 2008, 62.8% of all adults were employed, compared to 62.6% now. Given our ageing population, this seemed impossible even five years ago, but what happened was a massive change in our labour force. Since 2008 there has been a big increase in the number of women working, and the number of people working part-time. It has meant that, while the percentage of people employed is nearly back to pre-GFC levels, the average hours worked each month by the adult population is nearly 5% lower: With the average hours worked now again starting to fall, that will inevitably lead to rising underemployment as more workers seek greater hours. This does not bode well for improved wages growth, and also suggests that if we are about to enter a period of slower growth, we might be looking back on the past 18 months as the good times \u2013 which, given the lack of improved household incomes, is a fairly sobering thing to contemplate. \u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

O\u2019Brien, a former Queensland police officer, has been a persistent LNP advocate for an anti-corruption commission, and threatened to cross the floor in support of a bill proposed by the former independent MP Cathy McGowan last year. O\u2019Brien was convinced to hold fire when the government promised it was acting urgently on the issue and that a proposed anti-corruption body was \u201cimminent\u201d. But the Coalition\u2019s proposed model \u2013 named the commonwealth integrity commission \u2013 has since faced significant criticism, chiefly for the preferential way it treats politicians and the public sector. The body would not have the power to hold public hearings about government corruption or directly take public tip-offs, and would be unable to make findings of public sector corruption at large. That\u2019s at odds with the powers available to its separate law enforcement arm, which can hold public hearings, take referrals from the public, and more easily begin investigation of alleged corruptions. Speaking at a public event at Griffith University last month, O\u2019Brien said the proposed model suffered from \u201cdiminished\u201d powers to investigate government corruption. \u201cMy personal view \u2013 and I am not a government spokesman obviously \u2013 my personal view is that the powers are somewhat diminished for the public service and I would prefer to see parliamentarians and the commonwealth judiciary come under those more strenuous, those stronger investigative powers that are currently under \u2026 the Australian law enforcement commission,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. O\u2019Brien said politicians held a \u201cgreat deal of power\u201d and should be subject to the same scrutiny as law enforcement under the new anti-corruption commission. \u201cWe should be held to that highest standard and I think there\u2019s a very strong argument to have members of parliament \u2013 not necessarily staffers of members of parliament \u2013 but members of parliament and the commonwealth judiciary in there,\u201d he said.

      "bodyText": "The British government has privately appealed to senior Coalition ministers \u2013 including Angus Taylor and Marise Payne \u2013 to develop a more \u201cambitious\u201d climate policy, amid growing concern Australia is not doing enough to cut emissions. As the government fends off criticism from Pacific island nations about its climate policies, Guardian Australia can reveal that the UK\u2019s high commissioner to Australia, Vicki Treadell, has met with both ministers in recent months, and has conveyed Britain\u2019s view that it wants all countries, including Australia, to increase their climate ambitions. The UK has prioritised climate action, and last month became the first G7 country to legislate a target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Since 1990, the UK has reduced emissions by more than 40%, while the economy has grown by around 70%. It is understood the high commissioner\u2019s meeting with Taylor, who is the government\u2019s emissions reduction minister, took place in early July and discussed the future of Australia\u2019s energy policy after the Coalition dumped its proposed national energy guarantee in the dying days of Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s prime ministership. A bilateral meeting between Treadell and Payne, the foreign minister, also raised the need for more ambitious climate action, which has become a key concern of Pacific island nations, some of which face an existential threat from rising sea levels. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, last week fended off criticism about Australia\u2019s climate position at the Pacific Islands Forum after refusing to endorse a statement that had called for a quicker transition to renewable energy and a pledge to end coal-fired power. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning While Australia committed $500m in aid money to help respond to the climate emergency in the region, it has rebuffed calls for bolder emissions reduction targets and not to use carry-over credits to meet its 2030 Paris emissions reduction targets. Like Australia, the UK is also stepping up its diplomatic activities in the Pacific region, opening new posts in Vanuatu, Samoa and Tonga through what it has termed a Pacific \u201cuplift\u201d program. A spokesman for the UK high commission in Canberra said the call for more ambitious action on the climate emergency did not just apply to Australia. \u201cNo countries\u2019 targets have been ambitious enough and every country needs to do more, including both the UK and Australia,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cThe UK government believes we have a moral duty to leave this world in better condition than that which we inherited, which is why we have set ourselves a target of net zero emissions by 2050.\u201d The intervention comes as the Morrison government faces further international pressure to do more on climate, with the UN hosting a climate summit in New York next month, followed by the annual COP (Conference of the Parties) meeting for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which oversees global emissions targets. The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has asked world leaders to demonstrate at the September summit that they have plans for achieving zero emissions by 2050. Next year, the annual COP will likely be held in London, where Australia can be expected to face further pressure from Britain and other signatories to bolster its climate targets.",

      "bodyText": "Germany\u2019s economy is heading into recession after the country\u2019s central bank warned that a slump in exports during the summer was likely to continue into the autumn. The Bundesbank said a downturn in orders for cars and industrial equipment in the second quarter of the year was likely to continue in the third quarter, leaving the economy on the brink of a technical recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth. The bank, blaming a drop in exports, said Brexit and the trade war between the US and China were among the factors responsible for a 0.1% drop in GDP in the three months to June and would likely create a similar drop in the three months to September. It said: \u201cThe overall economic performance could decline slightly once again. Central to this is the ongoing downturn in industry.\u201d Forecasts of growth this year of 0.5% by the Bundesbank and the European commission are likely to be downgraded to nearer 0.2% or 0.3%, though analysts at Deutsche Bank said even these figures were vulnerable to downward revisions. \u201cGiven the increasingly fragile state of the global economy, the realisation of one or more risks could easily push the economy into a completely different scenario,\u201d the bank\u2019s analysts said. The dip in economic performance, even if it proves to be short-lived, comes at a bad time for Angela Merkel\u2019s coalition. The junior coalition partner, the Social Democratic party (SPD), is awaiting the outcome of a leadership election that many observers believe will result in the left of centre party, which has slumped in the polls, pulling its support. Stefan Schneider, Deutsche Bank\u2019s chief economist, said the coalition was also heading for heavy losses in the important state elections in Saxony and Brandenburg, where the Green party and the rightwing Alternative for Germany are expected to make gains. He said: \u201cThe fog over the [coalition\u2019s] future is unlikely to lift before the end of October when the SPD will present the result of the membership ballot on its new leader(s). We think that Merkel\u2019s government will become even more fragile.\u201d Germany has the fiscal strength to counter any future economic crisis \u201cwith full force\u201d, said the finance minister, Olaf Scholz, suggesting Berlin could provide up to \u20ac50bn (\u00a345.7bn) of extra spending. His comments came after a report last week said Germany was prepared to ditch its balanced budget rule and take on new debt to counter a possible recession. Confirmation that the country would use the threat of a recession to boost government spending helped calm markets rocked last week by concerns of a global slowdown led by the US, China and Germany. Eurozone sovereign bond yields, which reflect the borrowing rate paid by governments in the 19-member currency bloc, lifted from record low levels. Germany\u2019s 10-year bond yield was steady at -0.69%, above record lows hit last week at about -0.73%. German 30-year bond yields were also off record lows, trading at -0.22%. World stock markets were also cheered by a decision from China\u2019s central bank to alter the way it sets a key interest rate benchmark, a move seen by analysts as reducing borrowing costs for companies. Peter Chatwell, the head of rates strategy at the Japanese bank Mizuho, said Berlin needed the threat of a recession before it could unleash government spending. He said: \u201cThe point which is being missed is that the German fiscal stimulus is conditional on a recession, and existing law already allows for this. \u201cThe European Central Bank [ECB] would probably restart QE [quantitative easing] before the German fiscal taps were at risk of being nudged open.\u201d Inflation in the eurozone has more than halved in the last year from 2.2% to 1%, leaving the ECB little option but to cut the cost of borrowing from its already low levels. Mario Draghi, the ECB\u2019s outgoing president, said last month that the outlook for eurozone growth was worsening and inflation remained well below the bank\u2019s 2% target.

Those who claim to put saving the country from no-deal Brexit above all other causes will be put to the test. Brave and, yes, noble rebels will risk their seats and their careers, risk breaking their party, breaking with lifelong friends and colleagues, losing part of their own identity: these things hurt. How odd that many say they are willing to make those life-changing sacrifices \u2013 but not to work, even very briefly, with Corbyn. That absurd sticking point suggests a loss of any sense of proportion, almost as crazed as the no-dealers themselves.</p> \n<p>By all means let them list Corbyn\u2019s defects and failings, the company he keeps, the things done and those left undone. His many equivocations on Brexit continue: on Monday he and John McDonnell were suggesting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/19/labour-may-stay-neutral-if-second-referendum-is-between-its-brexit-deal-or-remain\" title=\"\">Labour take a neutral stand</a> in a future referendum, a move that would be likely to drive away more Labour voters. Indeed, what an irony that Corbyn may yet be the one to lead the escape from Brexit. But he is leader of the opposition with 247 MPs. And he is not the bogeyman of Tory propaganda; the red demon about to turn Britain into Venezuela. All things are relative: absolutely nothing he or his manifesto ever proposed has approached the radicalism of the hard-right Brexit experiment this government is subjecting Britain to. Nothing in his broadly social-democratic plans has come close to the revolutionary explosion Johnson intends in 10 weeks\u2019 time.</p> \n<p>Holding their noses, if this is the only means, anti-Brexit MPs of all parties will need to back an interim government to delay article 50, call a referendum and/or an election. Corbyn should invite a cabinet of all parties to guarantee this emergency regime has no other aim.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/19/jeremy-corbyn-nation-saviour-speech-labour-no-deal\">Corbyn could have been the nation\u2019s saviour.

Brave and, yes, noble rebels will risk their seats and their careers, risk breaking their party, breaking with lifelong friends and colleagues, losing part of their own identity: these things hurt. How odd that many say they are willing to make those life-changing sacrifices \u2013 but not to work, even very briefly, with Corbyn. That absurd sticking point suggests a loss of any sense of proportion, almost as crazed as the no-dealers themselves. By all means let them list Corbyn\u2019s defects and failings, the company he keeps, the things done and those left undone. His many equivocations on Brexit continue: on Monday he and John McDonnell were suggesting Labour take a neutral stand in a future referendum, a move that would be likely to drive away more Labour voters. Indeed, what an irony that Corbyn may yet be the one to lead the escape from Brexit. But he is leader of the opposition with 247 MPs. And he is not the bogeyman of Tory propaganda; the red demon about to turn Britain into Venezuela. All things are relative: absolutely nothing he or his manifesto ever proposed has approached the radicalism of the hard-right Brexit experiment this government is subjecting Britain to. Nothing in his broadly social-democratic plans has come close to the revolutionary explosion Johnson intends in 10 weeks\u2019 time. Holding their noses, if this is the only means, anti-Brexit MPs of all parties will need to back an interim government to delay article 50, call a referendum and/or an election. Corbyn should invite a cabinet of all parties to guarantee this emergency regime has no other aim. But if they balk, if they fail, then here is Corbyn\u2019s chance to redeem his Brexit reputation, showing himself the best of them all by nominating someone who could command a majority \u2013 it hardly matters who. His finest hour as the moderate compromiser putting his country first when others refused would send his chances of winning the election soaring up in the polls. His strong speech in Corby etched out a policy-rich election pitch, with well-honed attacks on Johnson. His greatest fall in popularity has been due to his Brexit foot-dragging \u2013 so he has most to gain from genuine willingness to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d, if that crunch comes. We shall see if he has it in him. None of that drama may be needed if a majority of MPs succeed in their plan to halt Brexit by seizing control of the parliamentary timetable: the Speaker has pledged to ensure MPs are not overruled. But if they fail and at the last hour, the only salvation for the country is the extraordinary prospect of Tory MPs holding their noses and backing Corbyn, that\u2019s what they must do. And if they lack the necessary patriotism, then let Corbyn show them how it\u2019s done. \u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist",

Turkey claimed the airstrike hit its convoy, killing three civilians, however a war monitor said a Russian airstrike took the lives of three rebels in the surrounding area.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/08/archive-zip/giv-3902jrwEoqAVE5PY/\" data-alt=\"Syria turkish convoy map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/08/archive-zip/giv-3902jrwEoqAVE5PY/\">Syria turkish convoy map</a> </figure>  <p>The intervention comes at a pivotal time in the fight for Idlib \u2013 the last corner of Syria without a regime presence \u2013 and was seen as a move to bolster a withering armed opposition and a beleaguered population of more than 3 million people. Syrian officials claimed the Turkish convoy was transporting ammunition and supplies to armed groups.</p> <p>Until recent weeks, a Russian-led offensive on Idlib launched in late April had made little progress, with opposition groups, among them jihadist factions, holding ground in the south of the province despite relentless barrage from the skies.</p> <p>However, momentum has shifted in the past week, with regime ground forces ascendant and Russian jets stepping up bombing runs that have obliterated towns and villages beneath them.</p> <p>The United Nations estimates that up to 400,000 people have been newly displaced inside Idlib. Many of those once again on the run are sleeping in the open with no shelter and little access to medical care.</p> <p>Hospitals and health clinics have been systematically targeted by airstrikes, severely limiting access to life-sustaining aid. At least 881 civilians and more than 2,000 combatants have been killed on the insurgent side in the past four months, while at least 1,400 pro-Assad troops are also thought to have been killed.</p> <p>\u201cUsing airstrikes and artillery, the regime is advancing by flattening everything in its path,\u201d said James Le Mesurier, the founder of Mayday Rescue, which runs the White Helmets civil defence organisation. </p> <p>\u201cThe towns and villages that it is proclaiming to have liberated are empty of all civilians who fled ahead of the fighting, with what possessions they can carry. Close to half a million people have been displaced in this current round of fighting. There are increasingly fewer places that they can escape to.\u201d</p> <p>Idlib has become the last redoubt of those who rose up against the Syrian dictator during the Arab revolts of 2011. As Syria\u2019s towns and cities have been pummelled and the regime \u2013 heavily backed by Iran and Russia \u2013 has clawed back early losses, displaced populations from all corners of the country have ended up in the north-west province.</p> <p>Among them are large numbers of extremists who established a foothold in Idlib in mid-2012 and with whom rebel groups and proxies backed by neighbouring states earlier in the conflict have been forced to co-exist.</p> <p>Winning back Idlib has become a primary goal of the Syrian leader and Russia \u2013 and to a lesser extent, Iran, which has extensively committed troops and proxies elsewhere in the war. Both sides have saved the central government from battlefield defeat.</p> <p>The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, on Monday reaffirmed his support for the Idlib campaign during a meeting with Emmanuel Macron in Paris. The French leader, meanwhile, urged for a recent ceasefire to once again be respected.</p> <p>Turkey\u2019s intervention adds a new dimension to an already intractable conflict, and one of the world\u2019s gravest humanitarian crises, which shows little sign of ending.</p> <p>While no longer robustly supporting the anti-Assad opposition, and now framing its involvement in Syria through its own interests, Ankara has insisted that it would not let the province fall militarily.</p> <p>To do so, would inevitably send tens of thousands of refugees towards its borders, at a time when Turkish authorities have been rounding up and deporting Syrian citizens in Istanbul and cities closer to the border.</p> <p>\u201cWe have moved to a narrower role, said one senior Turkish official. \u201cWe have our own interests in the outcome, which we will continue to shape.\u201d</p> <p>Khan Sheikhun has become a focal point of the fight for Idlib because of its position on a main highway linking Idlib city with Hama to the south. In April 2017, a sarin attack struck the centre of the town, killing 92 and maiming more than 200 people. The Organisation for the Prevention of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and a UN investigation blamed a Syrian regime jet for the strike. Donald Trump ordered the bombing of the base that the jet took off from in retaliation.</p> <p>\u201cAt least they only dropped one bomb on us then,\u201d said Mabrouk Falah, who fled Khan Sheikhun with his family as fighting escalated last week. \u201cNow it is just raining bombs, never ending. Everything is targeted, even the ants. And they wonder why we resist? And they wonder why we don\u2019t discriminate about who fights for us. The world has looked away, and we must survive whatever it takes.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Turkey has sent significant numbers of tanks and troops deep into Syria in an apparent bid to reinforce the town of Khan Sheikhun, where 92 people died in a 2017 sarin gas attack, one of the war\u2019s most infamous atrocities. Columns of Turkish forces, amounting to Ankara\u2019s largest incursion into Syria of the eight-year conflict, crossed the southern border into Idlib province early on Monday, accompanied by Arab proxy forces. Their advance was slowed by regime airstrikes that stopped them reaching the town in southern Idlib, where a battle continues to rage between anti-Assad groups and forces fighting on behalf of the Syrian leader. Ankara decried the airstrikes, and claimed its convoy was travelling towards outposts already established in the region under an agreement with Russia. Turkey claimed the airstrike hit its convoy, killing three civilians, however a war monitor said a Russian airstrike took the lives of three rebels in the surrounding area. The intervention comes at a pivotal time in the fight for Idlib \u2013 the last corner of Syria without a regime presence \u2013 and was seen as a move to bolster a withering armed opposition and a beleaguered population of more than 3 million people. Syrian officials claimed the Turkish convoy was transporting ammunition and supplies to armed groups. Until recent weeks, a Russian-led offensive on Idlib launched in late April had made little progress, with opposition groups, among them jihadist factions, holding ground in the south of the province despite relentless barrage from the skies. However, momentum has shifted in the past week, with regime ground forces ascendant and Russian jets stepping up bombing runs that have obliterated towns and villages beneath them. The United Nations estimates that up to 400,000 people have been newly displaced inside Idlib. Many of those once again on the run are sleeping in the open with no shelter and little access to medical care. Hospitals and health clinics have been systematically targeted by airstrikes, severely limiting access to life-sustaining aid. At least 881 civilians and more than 2,000 combatants have been killed on the insurgent side in the past four months, while at least 1,400 pro-Assad troops are also thought to have been killed. \u201cUsing airstrikes and artillery, the regime is advancing by flattening everything in its path,\u201d said James Le Mesurier, the founder of Mayday Rescue, which runs the White Helmets civil defence organisation. \u201cThe towns and villages that it is proclaiming to have liberated are empty of all civilians who fled ahead of the fighting, with what possessions they can carry. Close to half a million people have been displaced in this current round of fighting. There are increasingly fewer places that they can escape to.\u201d Idlib has become the last redoubt of those who rose up against the Syrian dictator during the Arab revolts of 2011. As Syria\u2019s towns and cities have been pummelled and the regime \u2013 heavily backed by Iran and Russia \u2013 has clawed back early losses, displaced populations from all corners of the country have ended up in the north-west province. Among them are large numbers of extremists who established a foothold in Idlib in mid-2012 and with whom rebel groups and proxies backed by neighbouring states earlier in the conflict have been forced to co-exist. Winning back Idlib has become a primary goal of the Syrian leader and Russia \u2013 and to a lesser extent, Iran, which has extensively committed troops and proxies elsewhere in the war. Both sides have saved the central government from battlefield defeat. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, on Monday reaffirmed his support for the Idlib campaign during a meeting with Emmanuel Macron in Paris. The French leader, meanwhile, urged for a recent ceasefire to once again be respected. Turkey\u2019s intervention adds a new dimension to an already intractable conflict, and one of the world\u2019s gravest humanitarian crises, which shows little sign of ending. While no longer robustly supporting the anti-Assad opposition, and now framing its involvement in Syria through its own interests, Ankara has insisted that it would not let the province fall militarily. To do so, would inevitably send tens of thousands of refugees towards its borders, at a time when Turkish authorities have been rounding up and deporting Syrian citizens in Istanbul and cities closer to the border. \u201cWe have moved to a narrower role, said one senior Turkish official. \u201cWe have our own interests in the outcome, which we will continue to shape.\u201d Khan Sheikhun has become a focal point of the fight for Idlib because of its position on a main highway linking Idlib city with Hama to the south. In April 2017, a sarin attack struck the centre of the town, killing 92 and maiming more than 200 people. The Organisation for the Prevention of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and a UN investigation blamed a Syrian regime jet for the strike. Donald Trump ordered the bombing of the base that the jet took off from in retaliation. \u201cAt least they only dropped one bomb on us then,\u201d said Mabrouk Falah, who fled Khan Sheikhun with his family as fighting escalated last week. \u201cNow it is just raining bombs, never ending. Everything is targeted, even the ants. And they wonder why we resist? And they wonder why we don\u2019t discriminate about who fights for us. The world has looked away, and we must survive whatever it takes.\u201d",

It was great seeing him get back up.\u201d While Smith\u2019s chances of an immediate return surely look remote, Archer must recover between these back-to-back Tests after a 44-over workload at Lord\u2019s. England are already reliant on the 24-year-old seeing out the series, although Jimmy Anderson will step up his return from a calf injury when playing for Lancashire\u2019s 2nd XI in Liverpool from Tuesday. Tim Paine had said his Australia side must find a way to counter Archer\u2019s short ball after Marnus Labuschagne, Smith\u2019s concussion replacement, was also knocked down having being struck in the grille second ball. The batsman admitted afterwards that, despite the shock, \u201cyou get up and try to act cool\u201d. Stokes\u2019s seventh Test century had set up a potential victory charge, only for Labuschagne to recover from the blow and help steer Australia to the draw by batting for more than two hours, and the England all-rounder thinks finding a way to combat Archer will be tricky. He added: \u201cJofra doesn\u2019t have any tells. Some bowlers you get a tell when they\u2019re going to bowl a bouncer. Because everything is so rhythmical with Jofra, it is tough to see when it is coming. He\u2019s very tight to the stumps as well. Everything looks just so languid, you wonder if he\u2019s loose and then he fires one down. It was very impressive to watch.\u201d Beyond Archer\u2019s stunning introduction and pride that his own unbeaten 115 showed doggedness, Stokes cited two further positives that England could take out of the Lord\u2019s Test. Jos Buttler and Jonny Bairstow enjoyed time in the middle after failures at Edgbaston, while Nathan Lyon, a match-winner in that first Test, took none for 102 in England\u2019s second innings. Stokes said: \u201cWe kept out Nathan\u2019s good balls and, when we attacked, we really committed to doing it. He could have had me five or six times, to be honest. I thought attack was the best form of defence by the end, because every time I defended one I kept nicking it but finding the gap, which was remarkable. \u201cI was running down the wicket and laughing at some points, thinking: \u2018I can\u2019t be placing it any better.\u2019 From a five-fer to none for 100 will give our batting unit a lot of confidence, especially on a pretty helpful wicket from spin. Not taking anything away from him, he bowled really well and probably didn\u2019t deserve his figures.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Boris Johnson has been prime minister less than four weeks. In the absence of parliament, he has made a spirited attempt to pretend that British exit from the European Union would be straightforward. Brexit will definitely take place on 31 October, he has insisted. It will either involve the EU abandoning the Irish backstop or there will be no deal. The difference scarcely matters to Mr Johnson, who insists Brexit will be a trouble-free exercise in whatever form it comes, whose dangers have been exaggerated and whose rewards underestimated.</p> <p>Every bit of this was false when Mr Johnson first concocted it. It is even more threadbare now \u2013 and getting more dangerous by the day. However, we may now be witnessing the first faint wisps of recognition from within the government that things are not going to work out as they pretend. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/operation-chaos-whitehalls-secret-no-deal-brexit-plan-leaked-j6ntwvhll\" title=\"\">Cabinet Office documents</a> on the likely aftershocks of a no-deal Brexit were leaked at the weekend. They covered every aspect of public policy. They are devastating. All of the impacts are bad; some are likely to be enduringly so. But the Johnson government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/18/number-10-furious-leak-document-predicting-no-deal-brexit-shortages\" title=\"\">response to the leak</a> was telling. Ministers focused on issues of process, not on the documents\u2019 substance. </p> <p>This is a classic diversion tactic. The Operation Yellowhammer documents show that no deal will have consequences far beyond the \u201cbumps in the road\u201d of which ministers speak so complacently. Those so-called bumps include: the return of a hard border in Ireland; months of logjams at Channel ports; disruption of fresh food, medicines and fuel supplies; delays at airports; clashes at sea between UK and EU fishing boats; severe restrictions on Gibraltar\u2019s frontier with Spain; insupportable strain on parts of the care system; exceptional demands on UK embassies from expats; and protests requiring extra police. One almost throwaway line observes that \u201clow-income groups will be disproportionately affected\u201d by price rises. To these can now be added the inhuman shambles that would follow the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/19/threat-to-end-freedom-of-movement-overnight-reckless-say-eu-citizens\" title=\"\">ending of freedom of movement</a> on 31 October, another Windrush in the making, and on an immensely larger scale.</p> <p>Mr Johnson\u2019s response is not to engage directly with these appalling possibilities. Instead he reiterated in Truro on Monday that the EU will shift its backstop position and let him off the hook. In other words, he recognises that a deal is better than no deal, but still <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/19/boris-johnson-confident-eu-will-back-down-in-brexit-talks\" title=\"\">pretends, against all evidence</a>, that the EU will abandon a central part of the withdrawal agreement. This too is a fantasy. Yet it shows that striking a deal \u2013 if it can be done \u2013 is preferable to crashing out. Mr Johnson will have to be a lot more honest when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/18/g7-leaders-wait-nervously-for-boris-johnson-debut-biarritz\" title=\"\">meets German and French leaders this week</a> if he wishes to have even a marginal hope of making one.</p> <p>But European leaders face questions too. They may think, as many in the UK also hope, that the combination of Johnsonian bluster and the parliamentary arithmetic on no deal means that the prime minister\u2019s reign will soon be aborted. They may think, as some here also do, that Mr Johnson\u2019s government will soon be replaced by a one opposed to no deal. But they need to be careful. Neither of these outcomes may happen before 31 October.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has been prime minister less than four weeks. In the absence of parliament, he has made a spirited attempt to pretend that British exit from the European Union would be straightforward. Brexit will definitely take place on 31 October, he has insisted. It will either involve the EU abandoning the Irish backstop or there will be no deal. The difference scarcely matters to Mr Johnson, who insists Brexit will be a trouble-free exercise in whatever form it comes, whose dangers have been exaggerated and whose rewards underestimated. Every bit of this was false when Mr Johnson first concocted it. It is even more threadbare now \u2013 and getting more dangerous by the day. However, we may now be witnessing the first faint wisps of recognition from within the government that things are not going to work out as they pretend. Cabinet Office documents on the likely aftershocks of a no-deal Brexit were leaked at the weekend. They covered every aspect of public policy. They are devastating. All of the impacts are bad; some are likely to be enduringly so. But the Johnson government\u2019s response to the leak was telling. Ministers focused on issues of process, not on the documents\u2019 substance. This is a classic diversion tactic. The Operation Yellowhammer documents show that no deal will have consequences far beyond the \u201cbumps in the road\u201d of which ministers speak so complacently. Those so-called bumps include: the return of a hard border in Ireland; months of logjams at Channel ports; disruption of fresh food, medicines and fuel supplies; delays at airports; clashes at sea between UK and EU fishing boats; severe restrictions on Gibraltar\u2019s frontier with Spain; insupportable strain on parts of the care system; exceptional demands on UK embassies from expats; and protests requiring extra police. One almost throwaway line observes that \u201clow-income groups will be disproportionately affected\u201d by price rises. To these can now be added the inhuman shambles that would follow the ending of freedom of movement on 31 October, another Windrush in the making, and on an immensely larger scale. Mr Johnson\u2019s response is not to engage directly with these appalling possibilities. Instead he reiterated in Truro on Monday that the EU will shift its backstop position and let him off the hook. In other words, he recognises that a deal is better than no deal, but still pretends, against all evidence, that the EU will abandon a central part of the withdrawal agreement. This too is a fantasy. Yet it shows that striking a deal \u2013 if it can be done \u2013 is preferable to crashing out. Mr Johnson will have to be a lot more honest when he meets German and French leaders this week if he wishes to have even a marginal hope of making one. But European leaders face questions too. They may think, as many in the UK also hope, that the combination of Johnsonian bluster and the parliamentary arithmetic on no deal means that the prime minister\u2019s reign will soon be aborted. They may think, as some here also do, that Mr Johnson\u2019s government will soon be replaced by a one opposed to no deal. But they need to be careful. Neither of these outcomes may happen before 31 October. Neither of them may happen at all. The dangerous recklessness on the leave side of Britain\u2019s Brexit divide is matched by a worrying haplessness on the remain side. The divisions between remainers and anti-no-dealers, and between the parties within the anti-no-deal majority, remain frustratingly strong. Jeremy Corbyn plays a part in many of these divides, but he also has to be part of any solution. His speech in Corby on Monday, in which he proposed a vote of no confidence in Mr Johnson\u2019s government followed by a time-limited caretaker administration that would avert no deal and call an election, should be taken seriously, not dismissed. Mr Corbyn\u2019s speech is not the last word on the issues. His proposed caretaker administration might, for instance, involve other parties. But the importance of avoiding no deal is immense and pressing. All opponents of such a cataclysm should be ready to do whatever it takes.",

I checked with the British Horse Society, who pointed out that a survey <a href=\"https://www.beta-uk.org/pages/news-amp-events/news/national-equestrian-survey-2019-provides-optimistic-view-of-industry.php\">published this year by the British Equestrian Trade Association</a> shows three million people in Britain had actually ridden a horse within the previous 12 months; that\u2019s about 4.5% of the population who have not just seen a horse in the flesh but actually sat on one recently.</p> \n<p>From the pages sent to me, it seems this survey did not cover the age of those riding but a previous survey, in 2011, found that a quarter of all British riders were under the age of 16. Since that age group <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/articles/overviewoftheukpopulation/november2018\">makes up only 19% of the population</a> you could say that the young are over-represented among riders.</p> \n<p>All of which suggests that, in the absence of further evidence, Rust\u2019s stat is probably not accurate.

Rust cites it because he thinks the whip rules need to change to reflect the views of a wider society with no connection to the game, but if he is going to make that case stick, he had better get some believable insights into what those views are.</p> \n<p>I\u2019m afraid this stat is no more convincing than his argument on Racing TV in the spring that we should all be worried because, as he said at the time: \u201cThere are offices in London now which don\u2019t have milk in the office fridges. They don\u2019t have it because milk is bad. Milk leads to cows being forced to be milked and more methane in society.

The veteran jockey has been the default rider for the high-achieving mare this season and last and has done well, partnering her to six successes, but her owner, David Armstrong, wanted a change.</p> \n<p>She will instead be ridden by Gerald Mosse, who came in for the winning ride aboard Mabs Cross in the Prix de l\u2019Abbaye last autumn, Mulrennan having been sidelined with a broken back at the time. Armstrong evidently wants the Frenchman to ride her in the Abbaye again and has therefore asked for him to take the mount this time, in what is likely to be her final outing before Paris.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/aug/24/graham-lee-alpha-delphini-nunthorpe-stakes-york-photo-finis-stradivarius\">Mabs Cross was beaten a nose</a> in last year\u2019s Nunthorpe at odds of 14-1. She is no bigger than 9-2 this time but will face the classy pair of Ten Sovereigns and Battaash. \u201cYou\u2019ve only got to look at those two to know it won\u2019t be easy,\u201d Dods continued. \u201cBut she\u2019s in great form and she\u2019s in with a shout. She\u2019s moving well and eating well.\u201d Mulrennan broke the news <a href=\"https://www.racingtv.com/news/paul-mulrennan-loses-mabs-cross-ride-to-gerald-mosse\">through his Racing TV blog,</a> in which he made no complaint. \u201cHer owners have obviously decided to take me off, but they are entitled to their choice and I\u2019m not the first jockey in the world \u2013 and I won\u2019t be the last either \u2013 to lose a big ride like this,\u201d he said.<br></p> \n<p>Japan and Circus Maximus will represent Aidan O\u2019Brien in the Juddmonte International, the big race on day one of York\u2019s Ebor meeting, which starts on Wednesday. The Irishman took out his Derby winner, Anthony Van Dyck, at the final declaration stage, when Enable and Magical were also withdrawn. Japan, to be ridden by Ryan Moore, is 11-2 third-favourite behind Crystal Ocean and King Of Comedy.</p> \n<h2>Monday\u2019s best bets</h2> \n<p>I haven\u2019t enjoyed my recent engagements with Catterick handicaps but there\u2019s a handful of horses that catch my eye at the Scotch Corner track today. <strong>Night Law (3.00)</strong> is especially interesting at 7-1, having bounced back to winning form over this course and distance a fortnight ago, when blinkers were fitted for the first time.</p> \n<p>Yonks ago, this mare won a Sandown maiden for Andrew Balding. She lost her way handicapping for Richard Fahey the next year but she was racing off marks in the 70s. After two seasons in Ireland with low-profile trainers, she had crashed down to 46 before scoring on her third start for Katie Scott. Now up 5lb to a rating of 51, she is probably still well treated.</p> \n<p><strong>Good Night Mr Tom (2.30)</strong> looks fairly priced at 6-4 to follow up his nursery success, his first run since being gelded, while the 15-2 shot <strong>Tapis Libre (5.35)</strong> has come down to an attractive mark and has a visor on for only the second time.</p> \n<p>Pick of the Windsor card tonight could be <strong>Perfect Refuge (7.00)</strong>, a Clive Cox filly who was arguably unlucky when beaten here a fortnight ago and now has a weight pull with the winner. She\u2019s 11-2.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6a615677-2113-4d5a-a208-ebd4316c5812\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Brighton</b>&nbsp;<br><b>1.40 </b>Big Time Maybe <b>2.10</b> Laikaparty <b>2.40</b> Tin Hat <b>3.10 </b>So Macho<b> 3.40</b> Paddy&nbsp;The Chef <b>4.10</b> Lady Mascara<b> 4.40</b> Harlequin Rose<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Kempton</b>&nbsp;<br><b>2.00</b> Pearl Stream <b>2.30</b> Overpriced Mixer <b>3.00</b> Loving Glance <b>3.30</b> Magical&nbsp;Rhythms (nap) <b>4.00</b> Toro Dorado <b>4.30 </b>Chica De La Noche<b> 5.05 </b>Typhoon Ten <b>5.40</b>&nbsp;Wanaasah<br><br><b>Yarmouth</b>&nbsp;<br><b>4.55</b> Simba Samba <b>5.25</b> Pocket Square<b> 5.55</b> Knowing <b>6.25</b> Contrast <b>6.55</b> Capla&nbsp;Berry <b>7.25</b> Queen Of Burgundy <b>7.55</b> Agent Of Fortune<br><br><b>Newton Abbot&nbsp;</b><br><b>5.35</b> Emerald Rocket <b>6.05</b> Triple Chief <b>6.35</b> Empreinte Reconce <b>7.05</b> Doctor&nbsp;Look Here (nb) <b>7.35</b> Bermeo <b>8.05</b> False Getaway</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

I\u2019m afraid this stat is no more convincing than his argument on Racing TV in the spring that we should all be worried because, as he said at the time: \u201cThere are offices in London now which don\u2019t have milk in the office fridges. They don\u2019t have it because milk is bad. Milk leads to cows being forced to be milked and more methane in society. The world is changing.\u201d Racing\u2019s chief executive needs to be a lot more careful about the evidence he adduces to support his arguments. Mulrennan loses ride in Nunthorpe on Mabs Cross Paul Mulrennan has lost the ride on Mabs Cross, third-favourite for the Nunthorpe Stakes at York on Friday. The veteran jockey has been the default rider for the high-achieving mare this season and last and has done well, partnering her to six successes, but her owner, David Armstrong, wanted a change. She will instead be ridden by Gerald Mosse, who came in for the winning ride aboard Mabs Cross in the Prix de l\u2019Abbaye last autumn, Mulrennan having been sidelined with a broken back at the time. Armstrong evidently wants the Frenchman to ride her in the Abbaye again and has therefore asked for him to take the mount this time, in what is likely to be her final outing before Paris. Mabs Cross was beaten a nose in last year\u2019s Nunthorpe at odds of 14-1. She is no bigger than 9-2 this time but will face the classy pair of Ten Sovereigns and Battaash. \u201cYou\u2019ve only got to look at those two to know it won\u2019t be easy,\u201d Dods continued. \u201cBut she\u2019s in great form and she\u2019s in with a shout. She\u2019s moving well and eating well.\u201d Mulrennan broke the news through his Racing TV blog, in which he made no complaint. \u201cHer owners have obviously decided to take me off, but they are entitled to their choice and I\u2019m not the first jockey in the world \u2013 and I won\u2019t be the last either \u2013 to lose a big ride like this,\u201d he said. Japan and Circus Maximus will represent Aidan O\u2019Brien in the Juddmonte International, the big race on day one of York\u2019s Ebor meeting, which starts on Wednesday. The Irishman took out his Derby winner, Anthony Van Dyck, at the final declaration stage, when Enable and Magical were also withdrawn. Japan, to be ridden by Ryan Moore, is 11-2 third-favourite behind Crystal Ocean and King Of Comedy. Monday\u2019s best bets I haven\u2019t enjoyed my recent engagements with Catterick handicaps but there\u2019s a handful of horses that catch my eye at the Scotch Corner track today. Night Law (3.00) is especially interesting at 7-1, having bounced back to winning form over this course and distance a fortnight ago, when blinkers were fitted for the first time. Yonks ago, this mare won a Sandown maiden for Andrew Balding. She lost her way handicapping for Richard Fahey the next year but she was racing off marks in the 70s. After two seasons in Ireland with low-profile trainers, she had crashed down to 46 before scoring on her third start for Katie Scott. Now up 5lb to a rating of 51, she is probably still well treated. Good Night Mr Tom (2.30) looks fairly priced at 6-4 to follow up his nursery success, his first run since being gelded, while the 15-2 shot Tapis Libre (5.35) has come down to an attractive mark and has a visor on for only the second time. Pick of the Windsor card tonight could be Perfect Refuge (7.00), a Clive Cox filly who was arguably unlucky when beaten here a fortnight ago and now has a weight pull with the winner. She\u2019s 11-2.",

The deal came under intense criticism for years, peaking after Donald Trump appointed Alex Acosta, the prosecutor in Florida who oversaw the deal, to his cabinet as labor secretary. Acosta <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/12/alex-acosta-resigns-trump-jeffrey-epstein-plea-deal-latest-news\">resigned last month</a> amid growing anger over his role in the case.</p> <p>Under the deal, Epstein served just 13 months in jail and for much of that time was allowed out during the day to work from his office. Records released by county authorities over the weekend showed that Epstein was allowed to purchase two pairs of small women\u2019s underwear from the jail shop during his stay.</p> <p>Investigators in New York revived inquiries into Epstein after the Miami Herald newspaper published an investigative series last year. Epstein was arrested after landing at a private airport last month and prosecutors unveiled new trafficking charges against him.</p> <p>The FBI continues to investigate Epstein\u2019s abuse even after his death, raising the possibility that former friends and associates could be prosecuted. The Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/17/jean-luc-brunel-jeffrey-epstein-models-sexual-assault\">revealed on Saturday</a> that Jean-Luc Brunel, a French modelling scout long accused of assisting Epstein, is also alleged to have sexually assaulted models for decades. Brunel denies taking part in Epstein\u2019s crimes and any wrongdoing in his own right.</p> <p>On Monday it also emerged that Epstein had signed a will just two days before his death. The existence of the will, first reported by the New York Post, opened a new legal front in what could be a lengthy battle over his estate.

In 2015 a court decided that the allegations made by Giuffre about the prince were \u201cimmaterial and impertinent\u201d and ordered them to be struck out of a claim against Epstein. Edwards said on Monday that Andrew\u2019s latest remarks \u201cgive the impression that he will do his part to ensure the victims of Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s crimes are able to get answers and justice\u201d. He added: \u201cI would like to personally help him provide these victims his assistance.\u201d Epstein\u2019s 2008 guilty plea was part of a lenient deal for him and \u201cany potential co-conspirators\u201d to avoid further prosecution over his extensive crimes. The deal came under intense criticism for years, peaking after Donald Trump appointed Alex Acosta, the prosecutor in Florida who oversaw the deal, to his cabinet as labor secretary. Acosta resigned last month amid growing anger over his role in the case. Under the deal, Epstein served just 13 months in jail and for much of that time was allowed out during the day to work from his office. Records released by county authorities over the weekend showed that Epstein was allowed to purchase two pairs of small women\u2019s underwear from the jail shop during his stay. Investigators in New York revived inquiries into Epstein after the Miami Herald newspaper published an investigative series last year. Epstein was arrested after landing at a private airport last month and prosecutors unveiled new trafficking charges against him. The FBI continues to investigate Epstein\u2019s abuse even after his death, raising the possibility that former friends and associates could be prosecuted. The Guardian revealed on Saturday that Jean-Luc Brunel, a French modelling scout long accused of assisting Epstein, is also alleged to have sexually assaulted models for decades. Brunel denies taking part in Epstein\u2019s crimes and any wrongdoing in his own right. On Monday it also emerged that Epstein had signed a will just two days before his death. The existence of the will, first reported by the New York Post, opened a new legal front in what could be a lengthy battle over his estate. Lawyers for the victims vowed to go after Epstein\u2019s assets even if the will had named beneficiaries, as his death means there will be no trial on the criminal charges against him. \u201cGive his entire estate to his victims. It is the only justice they can get,\u201d one of those lawyers, Lisa Bloom, told the Associated Press. \u201cAnd they deserve it. And on behalf of the Epstein victims I represent, I intend to fight for it.\u201d Agencies contributed reporting",

There can be periods of silence to give everyone the chance to think or read together. The point is: meetings do not have to be what meetings always have been. People don\u2019t really hate them An intriguing study in the MIT Sloan Management Review found that most employees had complained to colleagues about meetings. However, most of these complainants also admitted in private that they did not hate meetings as much as they said publicly. In fact, overall, 69% of employees rated the productivity of their most recent meeting between \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cexcellent\u201d, and only 16% said it was poor or worse. Maybe one hidden benefit of meetings is that they give us something to complain about together.",

In an instant more than 60 of the 1,000 guests were dead, hundreds injured.</p> <p>Few events are so joyous and optimistic as a wedding. So why would a terrorist group \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/17/dozens-feared-dead-or-wounded-after-afghan-wedding-hall-blast\">even one as brutal as </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/17/dozens-feared-dead-or-wounded-after-afghan-wedding-hall-blast\">Islamic State, which has claimed responsibility</a> \u2013 want to attack one?</p> <p>One reason is that Isis does not believe that restraint serves its purposes. As the atrocities that accompanied its expansion and rule in Iraq and Syria made clear, the group does not aim to win ordinary people\u2019s loyalty but to rule through fear and a few select powerbrokers. Its explicit savagery is not a byproduct of broader strategy. It is the strategy.</p> <p>But strategies \u2013 even those of groups like Isis \u2013 do not evolve in a vacuum.</p> <p> There have been significant changes in the political situation in Afghanistan over recent months. In July, <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/afghanistan-president-clarification-trump-kill-10-million-people-1450709\">Donald Trump said \u201cit\u2019s ridiculous\u201d</a> that US troops were still in the country, and Washington is now close to a deal with the Taliban, the reactionary Islamist movement ousted from power by a US-led invasion in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in 2001.</p> <p>The agreement would see the 14,000 remaining US forces in Afghanistan withdraw in return for a Taliban commitment to a ceasefire and a pledge not to support acts of international terrorism.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b5c90396c8062e2cfe0d1c7969f8f2d513d9eb48\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5c90396c8062e2cfe0d1c7969f8f2d513d9eb48/0_0_4952_2971/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Afghans carry the body of a victim of the Dubai City wedding hall bombing during a mass funeral.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Afghans carry the body of a victim of the Dubai City wedding hall bombing during a mass funeral.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rafiq Maqbool/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This latter concession may be less costly to the movement than some analysts think. <a href=\"https://www.afghanistan-analysts.org/the-great-talqaida-myth/\">The Taliban have always claimed </a><a href=\"https://www.afghanistan-analysts.org/the-great-talqaida-myth/\">their objectives</a><a href=\"https://www.afghanistan-analysts.org/the-great-talqaida-myth/\"> are purely nationalist</a>, and have not been directly linked to international attacks. </p> <p>Separate negotiations are due to start between the Taliban and the government of Afghanistan.</p> <p>More or less simultaneously, Isis has been definitively expelled from all the territory it held in Iraq and Syria, though it still exerts significant influence over swaths of land and large numbers of people there. This has consequences wherever else the group has established a presence.</p> <p>One is renewed ambition to establish territorial enclaves. In Islamic historical legal tradition, if you have no land you cannot be recognised as caliph and so alternative zones of potential expansion have become more important. The most propitious appear to be west Africa, the Sahel and Afghanistan.</p> <p>Isis in Afghanistan has grown from a handful of disaffected Taliban mid-level commanders five years ago to as many as 3,000 fighters.

      "bodyText": "Even by the bloody standards of Afghanistan, it was a brutal attack: a suicide bomber at a wedding celebration, detonating his device as children danced and the happy couple completed their marriage rituals. In an instant more than 60 of the 1,000 guests were dead, hundreds injured. Few events are so joyous and optimistic as a wedding. So why would a terrorist group \u2013 even one as brutal as Islamic State, which has claimed responsibility \u2013 want to attack one? One reason is that Isis does not believe that restraint serves its purposes. As the atrocities that accompanied its expansion and rule in Iraq and Syria made clear, the group does not aim to win ordinary people\u2019s loyalty but to rule through fear and a few select powerbrokers. Its explicit savagery is not a byproduct of broader strategy. It is the strategy. But strategies \u2013 even those of groups like Isis \u2013 do not evolve in a vacuum. There have been significant changes in the political situation in Afghanistan over recent months. In July, Donald Trump said \u201cit\u2019s ridiculous\u201d that US troops were still in the country, and Washington is now close to a deal with the Taliban, the reactionary Islamist movement ousted from power by a US-led invasion in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in 2001. The agreement would see the 14,000 remaining US forces in Afghanistan withdraw in return for a Taliban commitment to a ceasefire and a pledge not to support acts of international terrorism. This latter concession may be less costly to the movement than some analysts think. The Taliban have always claimed their objectives are purely nationalist, and have not been directly linked to international attacks. Separate negotiations are due to start between the Taliban and the government of Afghanistan. More or less simultaneously, Isis has been definitively expelled from all the territory it held in Iraq and Syria, though it still exerts significant influence over swaths of land and large numbers of people there. This has consequences wherever else the group has established a presence. One is renewed ambition to establish territorial enclaves. In Islamic historical legal tradition, if you have no land you cannot be recognised as caliph and so alternative zones of potential expansion have become more important. The most propitious appear to be west Africa, the Sahel and Afghanistan. Isis in Afghanistan has grown from a handful of disaffected Taliban mid-level commanders five years ago to as many as 3,000 fighters. These are mainly concentrated near the border with Pakistan. Isis strategic thinking has been heavily influenced by the advice of key jihadi thinkers who argued a decade or more ago that extremists needed to foment civil war, discord and chaos. The resultant bloody anarchy would allow them to gain support and eventual power. This was one reason Isis in Iraq made savage assaults on Shia Muslims central to its worldview and strategy, aiming to prompt civil war there. The victims of Sunday\u2019s attack were from Afghanistan\u2019s marginalised Hazara minority and Shia. The aim was slightly different though. A civil war is already under way, and there is no need to provoke a fresh one. Instead, the attack on the wedding underlined the inability of the Afghan government to protect its own citizens, prompting fear and anger and helping to ensure that any efforts to stabilise the country come to nothing. We can expect more attacks, as savage and shocking, if peace talks advance any further. The attack also comes at a key turning point that could offer a strategic advantage to Isis, which has fought bitterly with the Taliban over recent years as the newcomers have challenged the authority and ideology of the older movement. Hundreds, thousands probably, have died in the war between the rival organisations. If the Taliban stop fighting the US and the Afghan government, Isis will aim to take over the role of the main opposition force in the country, gathering to its banners all the malcontents and rejectionists any deal would inevitably create. They would also seek to attract the support of the Taliban\u2019s erstwhile supporters, inside and outside Afghanistan. High-profile, spectacular bombings that attract much media attention are a way of demonstrating their capabilities and determination, as well as showcasing its readiness to use appalling violence. Even successful peace talks are unlikely to end Afghanistan\u2019s long nightmare. No group has claimed responsibility for the 10 bombings on Monday in the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad. More than 30 people were injured when blasts hit restaurants and public squares as the country marked the 100th anniversary of its independence. A recent United Nations report documented 3,812 civilian casualties in Afghanistan in the first six months of this year. The Taliban caused 38% of these, while Isis caused 11%. The biggest number were caused by Afghan government forces and their allies. In the brutal competition for power in this most unlucky of countries, those who bear no arms are usually the victims.",

      "body": "<p>Dani Rodr\u00edguez had been a first division footballer for three minutes and 19 seconds when the ball dropped at his feet by the centre spot and a whole new world opened up, inviting him in. High in the stand at Son Moix, a Mallorca director edged forward and, he later admitted, thought: \u201cRun, Forrest, run!\u201d All around, 15,127 fans had pretty much the same idea. Down below, Dani did too. So he ran: fast and straight. \u201cI set off like mad; it felt like a whole herd chasing me,\u201d he said with a grin \u2013 and he got away, reaching the edge of the area before anyone from Eibar could catch him: 40 metres, four seconds, four touches. A fifth and the ball was in the net.</p> \n<p>Rodr\u00edguez carried on running but this time the herd heading after him were his own players: <em>primera</em>. Fists were in the air, supporters leaping into each others\u2019 arms, released at last, footballers tumbling and shouting. Mallorca were 1-0 up on the opening night. Only, the referee had his finger in his ear. Guadalupe Porras, his female assistant, the first in La Liga history, stopped and then they all did, as if someone had pressed pause. \u201cYou must have thought: \u2018<em>Hostia</em>, bloody hell, don\u2019t take <em>this</em> off me\u2019,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez was asked afterwards. \u201cYeah, and in those words,\u201d he replied, \u201cI didn\u2019t even know what they were looking at: there was nothing wrong with it.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/audio/2019/aug/19/handballs-the-pukki-party-and-la-liga-starts-with-a-bang-football-weekly\">Handballs, the Pukki Party and La Liga starts with a bang \u2013 Football Weekly</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>What they were looking at was Real Mallorca\u2019s first goal in the first division since 2013 and Rodr\u00edguez was right: there was nothing wrong with it. Mallorca had been to hell and back, dropping from first division to second and then to second B, down where pitches are far from perfect, municipal sports centres for homes, some worrying their very survival was in doubt. But on Saturday night here they were, back again. Consecutive promotions, both via the play-offs \u2013 only the second team to do so after Granada in 2011 \u2013 had returned them to the top flight and they had scored within four minutes. It had been fast, even if it did not feel like it to some fans, and so perhaps another minute waiting for the VAR would not matter much. They had already waited six years after all.</p> \n<p>Most of their players had waited much longer. Rodr\u00edguez is 31; he has been a ballboy in the Champions League for Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a but had never played for anyone in the first division; it had taken him until he was 29 to even play in <em>segunda</em>. Now he had scored. \u201cPffff,\u201d he said. \u201cSo many things went through my mind.\u201d A tweet later tried to explain some of them: \u201cNever give up, keep dreaming, keep working, believe in yourself, and in the end dreams come true: from Carregal [Betanzos, Galicia], to scoring at Son Moix in the best league in the world,\u201d he wrote, alongside a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/18danirodriguez/status/1162837882626871297?s=20\" title=\"\">grainy picture of himself as a kid</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/18danirodriguez/status/1162837882626871297\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"es\" dir=\"ltr\">Nunca decaigas, sigue so\u00f1ando, sigue trabajando, confia en ti y al final los sue\u00f1os se hacen realidad!!

Ante Budimir put one over from four yards. And while Eibar recovered, Mallorca did not fold. Instead they got the winner when Joan Sastre\u2019s cross was deflected by Paulo Oliveira and looped in with 15 minutes left to make it 2-1, a result met at the end by a huge roar. It was, Diario de Mallorca said, a \u201cfirst-class victory\u201d. \u201cA triumphant return,\u201d Ultima Hora called it. \u201cA sweet awakening.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cI could never have imagined this in my wildest dreams,\u201d Salva Sevilla had said when Mallorca were promoted back in June and he spoke for all of them there on Saturday. Between them, the eleven players who started had played 147 first division games, and 111 of those are his - a 35-year-old who most thought had left it all behind when he departed Espanyol two years ago. Twenty-seven are Manolo Reina\u2019s, a 34-year-old goalkeeper who hasn\u2019t been there for nine years. And Lago Juniour\u2019s five were at Numancia ten10 years back. Which just leaves 27-year-old Antonio Raillo\u2019s four at Espanyol in 2015-16. When Mallorca-born Xisco Campos, the club captain at 37, came on with four minutes to go to a huge cheer, it was his first top-flight game since the 2004-05 season and he played only three ever. \u201cI was especially happy for him on his \u2018re-debut\u2019, and in his home,\u201d manager Vicente Moreno said.</p> \n<p>The day Sevilla left Espanyol, it was to join Mallorca in Segunda B. One could call it Spain\u2019s third tier but, organised in four 20-team regional groups, usually excluded when people here talk about <em>\u201cf\u00fatbol profesional\u201d</em>, it is anything from third tier to seventh and known as \u201cthe well\u201d. It is easy enough to fall into but almost impossible to climb out of. Relegated from the first division in 2012-13, after 16 consecutive seasons there, Mallorca had been relegated again, falling into the well at the end of 2016-17.</p> \n<p>It was not supposed to be this way: Mallorca had been bought by Robert Sarver, the owner of the Phoenix Suns, in January 2016, when he spent \u20ac20.62m on shares. His president is the former tennis player, Andrew Kohlberg. Steve Nash, the former basketball player, is on the board. So is Graeme Le Saux. And his the CEO is Maheta Molango, a lawyer who scored twelve 12 seconds into his debut at Brighton, and also played for Lincoln, Oldham, Wrexham and Grays Athletic.</p> \n<p>Mallorca had come out of administration in 2012, with a payment plan that obliged them to return \u20ac40m over 10 years. The arrival of Sarver and Nash brought stability and promised the end of the bitter civil war that had crippled the club for so long. But as the Spanish phrase goes: if the ball does not want to go in \u2026 \u201cMallorca are a first division club who happen to be in the second division,\u201d Sarver had said but by the end of the 2016-17 season they were not even that. For the first time in 36 years they found themselves out of \u201cprofessional football\u201d. \u201cEverything that could go wrong did,\u201d Molango said. \u201cWe\u2019ve made mistakes and we\u2019re sorry.\u201d Javier Recio, the sporting director, vowed to \u201cgive back what we\u2019ve taken away\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8b1a0aa5117f5646a72ee4adb4cc71dacda9644c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b1a0aa5117f5646a72ee4adb4cc71dacda9644c/0_235_2173_2718/799.jpg\" alt=\"Guadalupe Porras Ayuso was assistant referee for Mallorca v Eibar \u2013 the first woman to officiate in La Liga.\" width=\"799\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Guadalupe Porras Ayuso was assistant referee for Mallorca v Eibar \u2013 the first woman to officiate in La Liga.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cati Cladera/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>They did not throw it all away. There was patience and a plan. That summer they brought in coach Moreno, who had previously won promotion from Segunda B with Nastic. They approached some players with three-year contracts, not the usual single year, promising they were building to return, and constructed a team for Segunda B but also for beyond. Sevilla was their first signing, dropping from first to third tier. Others followed.</p> \n<p>He, Moreno and the rest made their debuts at Peralada, in a municipal ground that holds 1,500 against a team taken over by Girona to be their B team. By the end of the season they had been promoted. By the end of the following season they had been promoted again. On Saturday first division football returned to the island.</p> \n<p>\u201cI never thought I was leaving the elite behind,\u201d Sevilla insisted, but truthfully he never thought this either. None of them did. And even if they imagined Mallorca getting there, many would not have imagined getting there with them. Most teams, when they get to the first division, obsessed by \u201cexperience\u201d there, change almost the entire team, denying them the reward they fought for. Some ditch the manager too.</p> \n<p>Like Saturday\u2019s opponents Eibar, a model for most to follow, Mallorca have not. Of the starting XI only Febas and Lumor Agbenyenu were new: five had played in Segunda B with them and four in the second division (including Iddrisu Baba, from the youth team). It is true they have signed nine players and want four more before 2 September; it is true, too, that they know it will be hard to survive and insist on humility \u2013 acting \u201cas if we were the shittest of the shit\u201d \u2013 aware that, at \u20ac29m, they have the division\u2019s smallest operating budget. It is also true that they won promotion on 23 June, a month after everyone else had finished, denying them preparation time. They know they will have to wait to see which players are left. But Saturday\u2019s line-up was not just circumstantial nor was the result. It is the way they want it.</p> \n<p>As one beaming director put it after the game, long after everyone had gone: \u201cI really, really like my team.\u201d</p> \n<p>So does Moreno, although he is pushing for more players. Already revered on the island, he was making his first division coaching debut at the same ground as he had made his first division playing debut for X\u00e9rez a decade before. \u201cSeven of those who played with us in Segunda B got on the pitch tonight. What sometimes looks like a handicap can be an advantage,\u201d he said afterwards. \u201cAnd this is a group of players who deserve to enjoy this opportunity because they\u2019re the ones who brought us here.\u201d</p> \n<p>At one pre-season training session Moreno was caught on camera ranting at his players, some of whom had arrived late. He sought the intensity, the enthusiasm, the effort that had taken them to <em>primera </em>and that would see them survive there, to impress on them the importance of the work and the size of the opportunity ahead, just how big this was. \u201cFor fucks\u2019 sake,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re already 10 minutes late and some of you have a face on. That\u2019s not going to last 30 seconds with me. A first division training session: some of you have been gifted this. The first \u2018face\u2019 I see, the first person easing off a little, that\u2019s it, up yours, gone. I don\u2019t care if we end up with just eight of us: I\u2019ll put [assistant coach Dani] Pend\u00edn on the pitch. Got it? Some players never get the chance to play in <em>primera</em>.\u201d</p> \n<p>On Saturday night Mallorca\u2019s players did. They had earned it, nobody else. And they took it. Fast. It was early when Dani Rodr\u00edguez set off running and late by the time he left, walking out of Son Moix with his son, \u201cPap\u00e1 14\u201d printed on the back of a mini-Mallorca shirt. \u201cLife can be wonderful,\u201d he said as he went.</p> \n<h2>Talking points</h2> \n<p>\u2022 You\u2019 are 38 and a half, you are beginning your last ever season, time almost up, you go on with just two minutes left, not long enough to do anything, and your opponents are FC Barcelona.

On a very impressive debut, Kieran Trippier produced a wonderful ball for the only goal for Atl\u00e9tico against Getafe.

      "bodyText": "Dani Rodr\u00edguez had been a first division footballer for three minutes and 19 seconds when the ball dropped at his feet by the centre spot and a whole new world opened up, inviting him in. High in the stand at Son Moix, a Mallorca director edged forward and, he later admitted, thought: \u201cRun, Forrest, run!\u201d All around, 15,127 fans had pretty much the same idea. Down below, Dani did too. So he ran: fast and straight. \u201cI set off like mad; it felt like a whole herd chasing me,\u201d he said with a grin \u2013 and he got away, reaching the edge of the area before anyone from Eibar could catch him: 40 metres, four seconds, four touches. A fifth and the ball was in the net. Rodr\u00edguez carried on running but this time the herd heading after him were his own players: primera. Fists were in the air, supporters leaping into each others\u2019 arms, released at last, footballers tumbling and shouting. Mallorca were 1-0 up on the opening night. Only, the referee had his finger in his ear. Guadalupe Porras, his female assistant, the first in La Liga history, stopped and then they all did, as if someone had pressed pause. \u201cYou must have thought: \u2018Hostia, bloody hell, don\u2019t take this off me\u2019,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez was asked afterwards. \u201cYeah, and in those words,\u201d he replied, \u201cI didn\u2019t even know what they were looking at: there was nothing wrong with it.\u201d What they were looking at was Real Mallorca\u2019s first goal in the first division since 2013 and Rodr\u00edguez was right: there was nothing wrong with it. Mallorca had been to hell and back, dropping from first division to second and then to second B, down where pitches are far from perfect, municipal sports centres for homes, some worrying their very survival was in doubt. But on Saturday night here they were, back again. Consecutive promotions, both via the play-offs \u2013 only the second team to do so after Granada in 2011 \u2013 had returned them to the top flight and they had scored within four minutes. It had been fast, even if it did not feel like it to some fans, and so perhaps another minute waiting for the VAR would not matter much. They had already waited six years after all. Most of their players had waited much longer. Rodr\u00edguez is 31; he has been a ballboy in the Champions League for Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a but had never played for anyone in the first division; it had taken him until he was 29 to even play in segunda. Now he had scored. \u201cPffff,\u201d he said. \u201cSo many things went through my mind.\u201d A tweet later tried to explain some of them: \u201cNever give up, keep dreaming, keep working, believe in yourself, and in the end dreams come true: from Carregal [Betanzos, Galicia], to scoring at Son Moix in the best league in the world,\u201d he wrote, alongside a grainy picture of himself as a kid. In a way his story was all of theirs; a bunch of players that probably never expected to be here but were not going to hold back now, 1-0 up and dominating, tearing into their opponents. Ante Budimir put one over from four yards. And while Eibar recovered, Mallorca did not fold. Instead they got the winner when Joan Sastre\u2019s cross was deflected by Paulo Oliveira and looped in with 15 minutes left to make it 2-1, a result met at the end by a huge roar. It was, Diario de Mallorca said, a \u201cfirst-class victory\u201d. \u201cA triumphant return,\u201d Ultima Hora called it. \u201cA sweet awakening.\u201d \u201cI could never have imagined this in my wildest dreams,\u201d Salva Sevilla had said when Mallorca were promoted back in June and he spoke for all of them there on Saturday. Between them, the eleven players who started had played 147 first division games, and 111 of those are his - a 35-year-old who most thought had left it all behind when he departed Espanyol two years ago. Twenty-seven are Manolo Reina\u2019s, a 34-year-old goalkeeper who hasn\u2019t been there for nine years. And Lago Juniour\u2019s five were at Numancia ten10 years back. Which just leaves 27-year-old Antonio Raillo\u2019s four at Espanyol in 2015-16. When Mallorca-born Xisco Campos, the club captain at 37, came on with four minutes to go to a huge cheer, it was his first top-flight game since the 2004-05 season and he played only three ever. \u201cI was especially happy for him on his \u2018re-debut\u2019, and in his home,\u201d manager Vicente Moreno said. The day Sevilla left Espanyol, it was to join Mallorca in Segunda B. One could call it Spain\u2019s third tier but, organised in four 20-team regional groups, usually excluded when people here talk about \u201cf\u00fatbol profesional\u201d, it is anything from third tier to seventh and known as \u201cthe well\u201d. It is easy enough to fall into but almost impossible to climb out of. Relegated from the first division in 2012-13, after 16 consecutive seasons there, Mallorca had been relegated again, falling into the well at the end of 2016-17. It was not supposed to be this way: Mallorca had been bought by Robert Sarver, the owner of the Phoenix Suns, in January 2016, when he spent \u20ac20.62m on shares. His president is the former tennis player, Andrew Kohlberg. Steve Nash, the former basketball player, is on the board. So is Graeme Le Saux. And his the CEO is Maheta Molango, a lawyer who scored twelve 12 seconds into his debut at Brighton, and also played for Lincoln, Oldham, Wrexham and Grays Athletic. Mallorca had come out of administration in 2012, with a payment plan that obliged them to return \u20ac40m over 10 years. The arrival of Sarver and Nash brought stability and promised the end of the bitter civil war that had crippled the club for so long. But as the Spanish phrase goes: if the ball does not want to go in \u2026 \u201cMallorca are a first division club who happen to be in the second division,\u201d Sarver had said but by the end of the 2016-17 season they were not even that. For the first time in 36 years they found themselves out of \u201cprofessional football\u201d. \u201cEverything that could go wrong did,\u201d Molango said. \u201cWe\u2019ve made mistakes and we\u2019re sorry.\u201d Javier Recio, the sporting director, vowed to \u201cgive back what we\u2019ve taken away\u201d. They did not throw it all away. There was patience and a plan. That summer they brought in coach Moreno, who had previously won promotion from Segunda B with Nastic. They approached some players with three-year contracts, not the usual single year, promising they were building to return, and constructed a team for Segunda B but also for beyond. Sevilla was their first signing, dropping from first to third tier. Others followed. He, Moreno and the rest made their debuts at Peralada, in a municipal ground that holds 1,500 against a team taken over by Girona to be their B team. By the end of the season they had been promoted. By the end of the following season they had been promoted again. On Saturday first division football returned to the island. \u201cI never thought I was leaving the elite behind,\u201d Sevilla insisted, but truthfully he never thought this either. None of them did. And even if they imagined Mallorca getting there, many would not have imagined getting there with them. Most teams, when they get to the first division, obsessed by \u201cexperience\u201d there, change almost the entire team, denying them the reward they fought for. Some ditch the manager too. Like Saturday\u2019s opponents Eibar, a model for most to follow, Mallorca have not. Of the starting XI only Febas and Lumor Agbenyenu were new: five had played in Segunda B with them and four in the second division (including Iddrisu Baba, from the youth team). It is true they have signed nine players and want four more before 2 September; it is true, too, that they know it will be hard to survive and insist on humility \u2013 acting \u201cas if we were the shittest of the shit\u201d \u2013 aware that, at \u20ac29m, they have the division\u2019s smallest operating budget. It is also true that they won promotion on 23 June, a month after everyone else had finished, denying them preparation time. They know they will have to wait to see which players are left. But Saturday\u2019s line-up was not just circumstantial nor was the result. It is the way they want it. As one beaming director put it after the game, long after everyone had gone: \u201cI really, really like my team.\u201d So does Moreno, although he is pushing for more players. Already revered on the island, he was making his first division coaching debut at the same ground as he had made his first division playing debut for X\u00e9rez a decade before. \u201cSeven of those who played with us in Segunda B got on the pitch tonight. What sometimes looks like a handicap can be an advantage,\u201d he said afterwards. \u201cAnd this is a group of players who deserve to enjoy this opportunity because they\u2019re the ones who brought us here.\u201d At one pre-season training session Moreno was caught on camera ranting at his players, some of whom had arrived late. He sought the intensity, the enthusiasm, the effort that had taken them to primera and that would see them survive there, to impress on them the importance of the work and the size of the opportunity ahead, just how big this was. \u201cFor fucks\u2019 sake,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re already 10 minutes late and some of you have a face on. That\u2019s not going to last 30 seconds with me. A first division training session: some of you have been gifted this. The first \u2018face\u2019 I see, the first person easing off a little, that\u2019s it, up yours, gone. I don\u2019t care if we end up with just eight of us: I\u2019ll put [assistant coach Dani] Pend\u00edn on the pitch. Got it? Some players never get the chance to play in primera.\u201d On Saturday night Mallorca\u2019s players did. They had earned it, nobody else. And they took it. Fast. It was early when Dani Rodr\u00edguez set off running and late by the time he left, walking out of Son Moix with his son, \u201cPap\u00e1 14\u201d printed on the back of a mini-Mallorca shirt. \u201cLife can be wonderful,\u201d he said as he went. Talking points \u2022 You\u2019 are 38 and a half, you are beginning your last ever season, time almost up, you go on with just two minutes left, not long enough to do anything, and your opponents are FC Barcelona. Yeah. And? Erm. And you are Aritz Aduriz, so you do what you do, of course. The strange case of the man who gets better as he gets older and who took that penalty got even more stupidly brilliant when he scored a ludicrous overhead kick to defeat Barcelona and send San Mam\u00e9s wild. \u201cHe\u2019s an animal,\u201d Athletic Bilbao\u2019s manager, Gaizka Garitano said. \u201cI have coached a lot of players but no one quite like him.\u201d So, could the season\u2019s best goal end up being its first? \u2022 21 July: Zinedine Zidane says that the sooner Gareth Bale leaves, \u201cthe better\u201d. August 17: Bale starts Real Madrid\u2019s opening game of the season, provides the superb assist for the opening goal in a 3-1 win at Celta \u2013 meaning that Madrid are ahead of Barcelona and top for the first time in 818 days \u2013 and heads home post-game having heard his manager say: \u201cHe\u2019s staying.\u201d Another Briton, another assist. On a very impressive debut, Kieran Trippier produced a wonderful ball for the only goal for Atl\u00e9tico against Getafe. That said, the a moment that Joa\u00e3o F\u00e9lix did a madness eclipsed everything else. Somehow, he went 70 metres, past three, getting kicked, pushed and pulled, all the way up the other end, part power, part quality, part sheer bloodymindedness, all genius, to win a penalty. Which \u00c1lvaro Morata missed. \u2022 Chimy \u00c1vila belter. Three words that vont tres bien ensemble. The scorer of last season\u2019s best goal did it again -\u2013 and on the opening day againonce more. \u2022 And, yes, the refereeing could even have got worse. Which is pretty impressive. \u2022 Full Monchi. Sevilla had seven new signings in their side, and a new manager, too. Julen Lopetegui\u2019s team beat Espanyol 2-0. \u2022 It was a good weekend for the new teams: Mallorca won, Osasuna won (somehow), and Granada scored four. Bbut still did no\u2019t win. Which leads us to: \u2026 \u2022 Always go to Villarreal. Well, obviously: Santi Cazorla\u2019s there. And he scored this weekend. As did Roberto Soldado on his return to Spain. But there\u2019 is more, as Spain\u2019s premier soccer statistician Mr Chip noted this weekend after a 4-4 draw with Granada: there have been 7,076 games this century and only 10 4-4 draws. FOUR of those have been at the Madrigal.",

      "body": "<p>It would be good for the quality of life in this country if more A-level students could grasp the difference between employability and earning potential (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/aug/16/students-dont-see-value-a-level-english-decline\" title=\"\">Farewell A-level English?</a>, 17 August). When it comes to actually influencing the world, studying English language and literature is hard to beat.</p> <p>During my A-level years (1963-1965), I devoured as much of the work of George Orwell as I could get hold of. This taught me that being able to communicate with both clarity and imagination gives you the edge in many situations (including writing to newspapers). Orwell was hardly powerful in conventional political terms, but he had huge influence and an abundance of what is today known as soft power. While the dominant western model of capitalism is creaking at the seams and life on the planet is at a critical juncture, how about challenging young people with English studies as a route to influencing our common future more than most? It is much more than knowing whether ending a sentence with a preposition is legitimate or not.<br><strong>Geoff Reid</strong><br><em>Bradford</em></p> <p>\u2022 The decline in numbers of A-level students studying English literature is a serious matter. Mr Gradgrind may want students to be \u201clittle vessels \u2026 to have imperial gallons of facts poured into them until they were full to the brim\u201d but today\u2019s world is urgently in need of a new generation that has learned to develop the imagination as to understand what it might mean to be someone else, to resist making the honestly complex into the dishonestly simple, and to respect language again as a vehicle for truth in all its varied depth and resonance. The study of literature is both a humane and political necessity \u2013 we must save it or diminish.<br><strong>Canon Mark Oakley</strong><br><em>Cambridge</em></p> <p>\u2022 While I have some sympathy with your editorial (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/16/the-guardian-view-on-a-levels-end-the-guesswork-in-university-admissions\" title=\"\">A-levels should come before, rather than after, universities pick students</a>, 17 August), the solutions suggested would not help schools, students or universities. The removal of AS-levels has clearly caused an issue for universities. It has also put pressure on creative subjects. Perhaps extending post-16 education could be a solution? There are a number of alternatives. Move A-levels to November and give students and teachers an extra term of education, then start the university term in January. Alternatively, move the exams to January and introduce a more radical income-supported, compulsory, community-based project involving both practical, research and reflective elements in the spring and summer terms, perhaps as a basis for an additional AS award. This would allow Stem students to get involved in arts and creative subjects, and arts students to explore the world of science and engineering.</p> <p>During this time students would be supported in a realistic assessment of their future pathway, whether at university, apprenticeship or in employment. Whatever choices are made it should be driven by the wellbeing and needs of the student and benefit and value to society rather than that of what are essentially business-driven institutions. <br><strong>John Wardle</strong><br><em>Sheffield</em></p> <p>\u2022 The experts will undoubtedly be correct in their explanation that the slight \u201cfall in grades\u201d was because of more students taking A-levels, rather than studying for qualifications more suited to their talents (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/aug/15/female-students-outnumber-males-in-a-level-science-entries\" title=\"\">Top grades in England suffer a dip but Wales and female scientists on the up</a>, 16 August). Another factor not mentioned, however, is the increased number of students in mostly private schools who are entered for Cambridge Assessment\u2019s Pre-U examinations, as a way of avoiding the newly reformed and more rigorous A-levels. A breakdown of results for all Pre-U examinations, with percentages of entries getting top grades in each subject, is surely needed.<br><strong>Bernie Evans</strong><br><em>Liverpool</em></p> <p>\u2022 The recent revelation of the scale of this year\u2019s A-level grade boundary \u201ccorrection\u201d, that identified Edexcel candidates for A-level maths needing 55% to get the A grade, while candidates with the OCR board needed 54%, should ring alarm bells. This is indicative of a serious internal mismatch between the taught curriculum, student tuition, the examination, and associated marking criteria. This should be giving the education secretary and the Department for Education considerable cause for concern. The scale of these particular grade boundary \u201ccorrections\u201d significantly compresses the effective marking scale and increases the effect of marking error variance. Consequently, the confidence in the accuracy of the resulting decisions at grade boundaries is very much reduced.</p> <p>It\u2019s not that the use of grade boundary correction is inappropriate, what is in question here is the scale of the correction needed by Edexcel and OCR. Such a significant \u201ccorrection\u201d points to internal failures in basic educational quality assurance processes. This not only undermines confidence in the examining boards but, more seriously, places the grade outcomes of more candidates into question. The number of candidates attaining the A grade is not an indicator of educational quality, as this is simply the result of applying a post hoc boundary correction.

      "bodyText": "It would be good for the quality of life in this country if more A-level students could grasp the difference between employability and earning potential (Farewell A-level English?, 17 August). When it comes to actually influencing the world, studying English language and literature is hard to beat. During my A-level years (1963-1965), I devoured as much of the work of George Orwell as I could get hold of. This taught me that being able to communicate with both clarity and imagination gives you the edge in many situations (including writing to newspapers). Orwell was hardly powerful in conventional political terms, but he had huge influence and an abundance of what is today known as soft power. While the dominant western model of capitalism is creaking at the seams and life on the planet is at a critical juncture, how about challenging young people with English studies as a route to influencing our common future more than most? It is much more than knowing whether ending a sentence with a preposition is legitimate or not. Geoff Reid Bradford \u2022 The decline in numbers of A-level students studying English literature is a serious matter. Mr Gradgrind may want students to be \u201clittle vessels \u2026 to have imperial gallons of facts poured into them until they were full to the brim\u201d but today\u2019s world is urgently in need of a new generation that has learned to develop the imagination as to understand what it might mean to be someone else, to resist making the honestly complex into the dishonestly simple, and to respect language again as a vehicle for truth in all its varied depth and resonance. The study of literature is both a humane and political necessity \u2013 we must save it or diminish. Canon Mark Oakley Cambridge \u2022 While I have some sympathy with your editorial (A-levels should come before, rather than after, universities pick students, 17 August), the solutions suggested would not help schools, students or universities. The removal of AS-levels has clearly caused an issue for universities. It has also put pressure on creative subjects. Perhaps extending post-16 education could be a solution? There are a number of alternatives. Move A-levels to November and give students and teachers an extra term of education, then start the university term in January. Alternatively, move the exams to January and introduce a more radical income-supported, compulsory, community-based project involving both practical, research and reflective elements in the spring and summer terms, perhaps as a basis for an additional AS award. This would allow Stem students to get involved in arts and creative subjects, and arts students to explore the world of science and engineering. During this time students would be supported in a realistic assessment of their future pathway, whether at university, apprenticeship or in employment. Whatever choices are made it should be driven by the wellbeing and needs of the student and benefit and value to society rather than that of what are essentially business-driven institutions. John Wardle Sheffield \u2022 The experts will undoubtedly be correct in their explanation that the slight \u201cfall in grades\u201d was because of more students taking A-levels, rather than studying for qualifications more suited to their talents (Top grades in England suffer a dip but Wales and female scientists on the up, 16 August). Another factor not mentioned, however, is the increased number of students in mostly private schools who are entered for Cambridge Assessment\u2019s Pre-U examinations, as a way of avoiding the newly reformed and more rigorous A-levels. A breakdown of results for all Pre-U examinations, with percentages of entries getting top grades in each subject, is surely needed. Bernie Evans Liverpool \u2022 The recent revelation of the scale of this year\u2019s A-level grade boundary \u201ccorrection\u201d, that identified Edexcel candidates for A-level maths needing 55% to get the A grade, while candidates with the OCR board needed 54%, should ring alarm bells. This is indicative of a serious internal mismatch between the taught curriculum, student tuition, the examination, and associated marking criteria. This should be giving the education secretary and the Department for Education considerable cause for concern. The scale of these particular grade boundary \u201ccorrections\u201d significantly compresses the effective marking scale and increases the effect of marking error variance. Consequently, the confidence in the accuracy of the resulting decisions at grade boundaries is very much reduced. It\u2019s not that the use of grade boundary correction is inappropriate, what is in question here is the scale of the correction needed by Edexcel and OCR. Such a significant \u201ccorrection\u201d points to internal failures in basic educational quality assurance processes. This not only undermines confidence in the examining boards but, more seriously, places the grade outcomes of more candidates into question. The number of candidates attaining the A grade is not an indicator of educational quality, as this is simply the result of applying a post hoc boundary correction. The issue here is that the boundary grade correction tool disguises a significant underlying problem that, if left unattended, will adversely affect all future A-level students. Dr Egils Praulitis (Retired lecturer and external examiner), Bristol \u2022 This year\u2019s A-level results day will have seen some young people and their teachers poring forensically over grade boundaries, and a similar level of analysis should be applied to broad statements about which family of subjects are up or down. For example, A-level geography gained nearly 1,500 entries this year, achieving a 4.2% rise on 2018. Growth was also experienced by political studies, history and sociology. These increases provide an important caveat to the assertion that \u201cparticipation in selected humanities fell by 3.1%\u201d particularly when only one subject area, English, rather than the full range of humanities, saw a decline in participation. The exam boards have recognised the influence of environmental and geopolitical changes on young people\u2019s A-level choices, so it is no surprise that geography, the subject that engages young people with the world\u2019s people, places and environments, is on the rise. The Society congratulates the growing generation of young geographers who received their results this year. Steve Brace Head of education, Royal Geographical Society (with IBG) \u2022 Are the government ministers and employers favouring sciences over the arts, and A-level English in particular, the same ones complaining that today\u2019s graduates can\u2019t string a sentence together? Incidentally, I\u2019m a philosophy graduate and it was excellent grounding for thinking outside the box and problem-solving in both my previous and new career.

This can be attributed, Oliver said, in part to dismissal of women\u2019s pain as hormonal emotions, and a long history of studying male (as in assigned male at birth) bodies as a stand-in for all bodies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/aug/05/john-oliver-trump-last-week-night\">John Oliver on Trump's rhetoric: 'Something we cannot afford to get numb to'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cMedicine has long chosen to believe that women are just hormonal men \u2013 or so children are tiny men, dogs are furry men, trees are big, hard still men, birds are men who can fly, fish are men who can glub and volcanoes are men who for some reason ejaculate lava,\u201d Oliver explained on the logic of male bodies used in a study on, of all things, cancer risks for the uterus.</p> <p>Moving on from gender, \u201cif I may quote the inside of Donald Trump\u2019s head when energy at one of his rallies seems to be flagging: let\u2019s get to the racism stuff\u201d, said Oliver, \u201cbecause there is a huge disparity in life expectancy between black and white Americans, particularly black men\u201d.</p> <p>This \u201cmortality gap\u201d has numerous factors, Oliver explained, though he focused in particular on alarming misinformation and racist beliefs still floating through medical schools.

      "bodyText": "On Last Week Tonight, John Oliver argued for an honest discussion around gender and racial bias in medical care, noting that \u201cif you are a woman and/or a person of color in the US, you may well have a very different relationship to our healthcare system than a white man\u201d. \u201cFrankly, who better to talk at you for 20 minutes about this than me, the whitest of white men,\u201d said Oliver, a self-described \u201cwalking cider donut \u2013 pale, filled with cake and found at every farmer\u2019s market in the north-east\u201d who gets a \u201csunburn while watching the Travel channel\u201d. Regardless, said Oliver, bias in medical treatment is a discussion we need to have in the US, around both sex and race. On the issue of gender bias, Oliver cited numerous studies in which women were statistically misdiagnosed; a 2017 study found that women were less likely than men to be referred for knee replacements; another found that women over 50 and critically ill were less likely to receive life-saving interventions. This can be attributed, Oliver said, in part to dismissal of women\u2019s pain as hormonal emotions, and a long history of studying male (as in assigned male at birth) bodies as a stand-in for all bodies. \u201cMedicine has long chosen to believe that women are just hormonal men \u2013 or so children are tiny men, dogs are furry men, trees are big, hard still men, birds are men who can fly, fish are men who can glub and volcanoes are men who for some reason ejaculate lava,\u201d Oliver explained on the logic of male bodies used in a study on, of all things, cancer risks for the uterus. Moving on from gender, \u201cif I may quote the inside of Donald Trump\u2019s head when energy at one of his rallies seems to be flagging: let\u2019s get to the racism stuff\u201d, said Oliver, \u201cbecause there is a huge disparity in life expectancy between black and white Americans, particularly black men\u201d. This \u201cmortality gap\u201d has numerous factors, Oliver explained, though he focused in particular on alarming misinformation and racist beliefs still floating through medical schools. One study from three years ago found that some doctors still believe there are \u201cfalse biological difference between blacks and whites\u201d; 25% of residents believed that black skin was thicker than whites\u2019, for example. Oliver was aghast at the findings. \u201cHoly shit, you do not expect to hear that at a medical school,\u201d he said. \u201cYou barely expect to hear it yelled across a table by a racist grandfather at Thanksgiving.\u201d He then pointed to a nursing textbook that was pulled just two years ago for its stereotypes on how different ethnicities describe pain. You expect textbooks to have typos or outdated information, Oliver said, not to \u201cbasically say that Hispanics think God is kinky and Native Americans will tell you wizard numbers\u201d. The point, Oliver said, is that these misconceptions have tangible consequences. \u201cThink about it: if a quarter of medical residents think that black people have thicker skin and nurses are being told that they think suffering is inevitable, that might lead to black people\u2019s pain being treated differently.\u201d This bias was best articulated, he added, by Wanda Sykes, who recalled in a recent standup special how she was sent home from a double mastectomy with \u201cibu-fucking-profen\u201d while white people are handed opioids \u201clike they\u2019re Tic-Tacs\u201d. Though some policies have been implemented to address specific issues \u2013 rules in California to fight the disparately high maternal mortality rates for black women \u2013 \u201cclearly, we need to think much bigger here, and I know I am just not the best vehicle for this message\u201d, Oliver concluded. So Oliver invited Sykes on the stage to offer comprehensive solutions based on personal experience. First, doctors and medical students need bias training, Sykes said. \u201cI know that doesn\u2019t sound like fun, but it\u2019s one of those things that\u2019s not fun, but you should do it anyway, like reading with your kids.\u201d Second, Sykes said, \u201cwe need more non-white doctors in actual hospitals, not just the ones made up by Shonda Rhimes\u201d. And finally, until those two things are done, Sykes urged black women to advocate for themselves. \u201cAnd if that doesn\u2019t work, don\u2019t worry: I\u2019ve got a back up plan,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s called: bring a white man.\u201d Sykes then offered video clips of Larry David explaining symptoms \u201cfor every occasion\u201d, from \u201clady heart attacks\u201d to elbow pain, all of which were available for patient use on WhatsLarrysProblem.com.",

Axios claimed that in recent months Cabello, the 56-year-old head of Venezuela\u2019s pro-Maduro constituent assembly, had been communicating with Trump\u2019s top Latin America adviser, Mauricio Claver-Carone. Some Trump officials considered that a positive sign suggesting Maduro\u2019s circle was \u201cgradually cracking\u201d. The Associated Press claimed Cabello had met someone \u201cin close contact with the Trump administration\u201d in Caracas last month and that a second meeting was planned. By engaging with Cabello it said the US hoped to intensify an internal \u201cknife fight\u201d supposedly raging at the pinnacle of Maduro\u2019s administration. Maduro has been fighting for his political life since January when a young opposition leader called Juan Guaid\u00f3 declared himself Venezuela\u2019s rightful president and received the backing of more than 50 governments, including the US and UK. Cabello has yet to directly address claims he was talking to Washington, although an aide told the Associated Press he would only do so with Maduro\u2019s permission. On Monday Cabello shared a tweet mocking the allegations with his 2.3 million followers. \u201cDiosdado met in SECRET with a gringo SECRET agent to agree a SECRET plan to topple Nicol\u00e1s, who knows nothing about this, because if he did know it wouldn\u2019t be a SECRET,\u201d it said. Any move to involve Cabello in Venezuela\u2019s post-Maduro political future \u2013 or offer him immunity from prosecution for alleged crimes - would be highly controversial among government opponents. \u201cHe is widely detested. He\u2019s seen as this central hub of corruption in the regime,\u201d said Ramsey. However, Ramsey said that with Venezuela\u2019s crisis dragging on US officials seemed aware \u201cbitter pills\u201d might have to be swallowed to secure Maduro\u2019s downfall. Sabatini said the suggestion the US was negotiating with a man accused of human rights abuses and \u201call sorts of illicit activities\u201d was troubling. \u201cDiosdado is probably not a man who should be negotiated or bargained with.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Four men have been jailed for life for murdering a man in a \u201cvicious, terrifying and sustained\u201d machete attack in the street. Sajed Choudry, 42, was fatally attacked near his home in Blackburn after a feud between two families. A trial at Preston crown court heard how Choudry, a father of four, had been involved in an escalating dispute with members of the Ali family before it escalated into \u201clarge-scale disorder\u201d on 24 November last year. Choudry\u2019s ears were partially severed and his skull was split while his son Ahsan, 24, suffered an \u201cappalling\u201d wound to his hand during the attack, the court heard. The judge, Mr Justice Dove, on Monday sentenced Sadaqat Ali, 36, his brother Rafaqat Ali, 38, their father-in-law Fazal Ilahi, 63, and another man, Syed Ali Akbar, 45, to life terms. He said: \u201cAnyone who has observed the evidence in this trial as it has unfolded will have been astonished and horrified to learn how a respectable family, leading a constructive and responsible life in the community, allowed itself to so rapidly descend into callous violence and murder, killing one of their neighbours and seriously injuring his son.\u201d The court heard that the Choudry and Ali families had been involved in a feud for seven months before the incident. Jurors were told about earlier confrontations between the two families, including one when car tyres were allegedly slashed by another of Choudry\u2019s sons. On the evening of the murder, Sadaqat Ali and the other men had armed themselves with a machete, an axe and sticks before they tried to confront Ahsan Choudry. CCTV footage was shown to the jury of Choudry and his son attempting to defend themselves with a baseball bat and a cricket bat but they were \u201ccompletely outnumbered\u201d, said the judge. Dove said they were \u201csubjected to a vicious, terrifying and sustained attack. Sajed Choudry was slashed and chopped by the machete\u201d. The court heard that Ahsan Choudry tried to escape but was chased and suffered an \u201cappalling injury\u201d to his hand as he tried to fend off the knife. Members of the Choudry family were in tears in the public gallery as the men were sentenced. The judge told the defendants: \u201cBy your actions you have left a void in this family which will never be filled.\u201d Sadaqat Ali was found guilty of murder and attempted murder and sentenced to a minimum of 32 years. The judge said he played the leading role in the attack, which was \u201cundoubtedly planned\u201d. Guy Gozem QC, defending, said: \u201cBefore this night, Sadaqat Ali was regarded as a friendly, hard-working, considerate, caring, good-natured, calm and reliable individual.

      "bodyText": "Howard University is bringing back its long-dormant college golf program with an assist from Stephen Curry. The Golden State Warriors star announced a seven-figure donation on Monday to establish the first Division I men\u2019s and women\u2019s golf teams in the 152-year history of the historically black university in Washington DC. \u201cNo matter where you come from or what socioeconomic background you had, we all were that kid once upon a time that was just excited about finding out who they were as a person through athletics,\u201d the Golden State Warriors guard told the Washington Post. Howard athletic director Kery Davis said Curry\u2019s donation \u201cwas sort of a jolt for us\u201d. The school has not offered the sport since a Division II golf team folded in the 1970s. \u201cGolf has always been a game of privilege,\u201d Davis said. \u201cAn association with the sport can break down barriers.\u201d Davis told the Post that it will take about a year to hire coaches, recruit student-athletes and find a course to practice and play on. \u201cGolf is a sport that has changed my life in ways that are less tangible, but just as impactful,\u201d Curry said in a release. \u201cIt\u2019s a discipline that challenges your mental wherewithal from patience to focus, and is impossible to truly master, so when you hear about these passionate student athletes who have the talent but don\u2019t have a fair shot at the game, it\u2019s tough. I feel really honored to play a small role in the rich history of Howard University.\u201d The announcement took place on Monday in the nation\u2019s capital at Langston Golf Course, the second racially desegregated golf course in the District of Columbia. \u201cHoward University is honored to partner with NBA champion Stephen Curry to launch what is sure to become one of the best golf programs in the country,\u201d university president Wayne AI Frederick said. \u201cThis program will expose the campus to a game with numerous benefits. Golf is unique because it can be played through various ages of life. Grandfathers can play with granddaughters.\u201d A longtime golfer, Curry is a semi-regular on the pro-am circuit and shot an opening-round 4-over 74 in his professional golf debut playing on an exemption at the Web.com Tour\u2019s Ellie Mae Classic in 2017. The two-time NBA Most Valuable Player made his foray into television as an executive producer and on-air resident pro for the mini-golf reality competition series Holey Money, which premiered to top ratings in June.",

It would also, they would say, be the right thing for the country.</p> \n  <p>2) If there is going to be an early election, there would be advantages for Corbyn to holding it with Brexit delayed - because the Tories would probably get crushed by the Brexit party.</p> \n  <p>3) An incumbent PM has many advantages in an election campaign. For example, s/he sets the date. And s/he can use the platform that government provides for party advantage, even though civil service resources are not meant to be spent on party political activity. Just look at the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/10DowningStreet\">@10DowningStreet</a> twitter feed, which reads like a Tory account even though it is a government one.</p> \n  <p>4) Being prime minister helps you look prime ministerial - which is particularly useful if, like Corbyn, you are thought not to be prime ministerial.</p> \n  <p>5) Even without a government majority, there is a lot a prime minister can do through prerogative powers, and through the use of patronage.</p> \n  <p>6) Prime ministers without a party majority have in the past managed to fight elections and come out with a majority (eg Wilson in 1974, Cameron in 2015).</p> \n  <p>7) No politician interested in changing Britain would turn down the chance to become PM - even for a short period.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-19T15:26:16.966Z\">at 4.26pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d5ab3ce8f084f687f3593f4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-19T14:36:25.461Z\">3.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c4a141b71ddf783da8bb680fd73a5216aa4f473\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c4a141b71ddf783da8bb680fd73a5216aa4f473/0_36_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson talking to patient Scarlett Gibbons, 5, during his visit to the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro this morning.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson talking to patient Scarlett Gibbons, 5, during his visit to the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro this morning.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Nicholls/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d5ab1b88f084f687f3593e7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-19T14:29:16.344Z\">3.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Tom Brake,</strong> the Lib Dem Brexit spokesman, says that if Jeremy Corbyn really intends to do \u201ceverything necessary\u201d to stop a no-deal Brexit, as he promised in his speech this morning, he must prove it.

You can read the full text <a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/press/jeremy-corbyn-speech-corby-today/\">here.</a> It was clear and coherent, and as a round-up of Labour\u2019s policy offer, it was fine (although the party could probably still go a lot further in terms of boiling it down to a two or three-point message that everyone would remember). </p> \n  <p>Johnson makes much of his ability to project optimism, and there was some evidence in the speech of Corbyn trying to respond in kind, for example when he spoke of the possible \u201cfantastic\u201d future available under Labour. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/aug/19/brexit-latest-news-jeremy-corbyn-speech-labour-could-be-officially-neutral-in-any-second-referendum-campaign-john-mcdonnell-suggests-live-news?page=with:block-5d5a7b968f084f687f359193#block-5d5a7b968f084f687f359193\">11.36am.) </a>But exuberance isn\u2019t a Corbyn forte, and he was much better when he was critiquing the government. The best passage was probably the one where he described Johnson\u2019s spending announcements as an admission that Labour has won the argument on austerity (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/aug/19/brexit-latest-news-jeremy-corbyn-speech-labour-could-be-officially-neutral-in-any-second-referendum-campaign-john-mcdonnell-suggests-live-news?page=with:block-5d5a79cc8f084f687f359178#block-5d5a79cc8f084f687f359178\">11.29am)</a>, and the points he made about crime and youth services that he used to back this up (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/aug/19/brexit-latest-news-jeremy-corbyn-speech-labour-could-be-officially-neutral-in-any-second-referendum-campaign-john-mcdonnell-suggests-live-news?page=with:block-5d5a7a1d8f0896be8f8fbbeb#block-5d5a7a1d8f0896be8f8fbbeb\">11.31am).</a></p> \n  <p>But you can\u2019t take down a government with a single speech, and so at best this was just a start. It may also have been infused with a bit of wishful thinking. Corbyn has often spoken in terms that suggest he wants to move on from Brexit and his speech contained a persuasive passage arguing that the problems facing the country go well beyond Brexit. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/aug/19/brexit-latest-news-jeremy-corbyn-speech-labour-could-be-officially-neutral-in-any-second-referendum-campaign-john-mcdonnell-suggests-live-news?page=with:block-5d5a71738f08c7e177d4d129#block-5d5a71738f08c7e177d4d129\">11.02am.)</a> They do. But politicians have to campaign in the world as it is, on an agenda not always of their own choosing, and the Q&amp;A made it clear that the prospect of the next election not being dominated by Brexit seems remote. </p> \n  <p>There is a summary of some of the main lines in the Corbyn speech <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/aug/19/brexit-latest-news-jeremy-corbyn-speech-labour-could-be-officially-neutral-in-any-second-referendum-campaign-john-mcdonnell-suggests-live-news?page=with:block-5d5a71738f08c7e177d4d129#block-5d5a71738f08c7e177d4d129\">here. </a>And here is a summary of the main points from the Q&amp;A.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Corbyn said any MPs serious about stopping a no-deal Brexit should back him to lead an interim government.</strong> Asked about calls for him to allow someone else to form a cross-party, interim government to block no deal, he replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I am the leader of the opposition, the leader of the Labour party. All the constitutional precedents are, when a government collapses, it\u2019s the leader of the opposition that takes over.</p> \n   <p>There seems to be an awful lot of very imaginative what iffery in the press at the present time. We will put a motion of no confidence in the government. We will do everything we can to stop a no deal Brexit. </p> \n   <p>I have written to the leaders of all of the other opposition parties inviting them to join me in this and I simply say to them, and to those probably quite small number of Conservatives who are alarmed at the prospect of a no deal Brexit: \u201cIf you\u2019re serious about stopping an no-deal Brexit, then back my motion of no confidence to stop this government taking us over a cliff edge on the 31st October.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Corbyn played down the prospect of MPs being able to stop a no-deal Brexit by any means other than using a no confidence vote to install him as an interim prime minister.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We offer to form a minority administration in order to give the people the choice in the future through a general election.

Things cannot go on as they were before. </p> \n   <p>The Conservatives, and the wealthy establishment they represent, have failed our country. They have failed to protect living standards, savaged our public services, deepened inequality and failed to keep us safe.

And Number 10 is firmly ruling out a recall. </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>McDonnell reaffirmed Labour\u2019s opposition to backing an interim government to stop a no-deal Brexit led by anyone other than Jeremy Corbyn. </strong>Asked to confirm that Labour would not support a vote in the Commons for someone else to lead an interim, cross-party government of this kind, McDonnell replied: </li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>No, we won\u2019t. We want to abide by the normal constitutional practice. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Labour argues that, if the prime minister loses the confidence of the Commons, the normal procedure is for the leader of the opposition to be invited to form a government.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>McDonnell said Corbyn would host talks with other opposition party leaders next week to discuss what could be done to prevent a no-deal Brexit. </strong>He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Jeremy is going to bring the [leaders] of the opposition parties together - he has already had some conversations - he will bring them together again next week and talk about how we go forward. We don\u2019t believe [having an interim government led by someone other than Corbyn] is a negotiable issue.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>McDonnell said that a no confidence vote, leading to the establishment of a new government, was not the only mechanism available to prevent a no-deal Brexit.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think the big issue now is how do we prevent [no deal], and the no confidence motion is one mechanism. </p> \n   <p>But, as Jeremy has said today, there\u2019s other mechanisms people are looking at, other parliamentary mechanisms, and we want to have a proper discussion and dialogue on a cross-party basis on what those mechanisms are.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>McDonnell claimed there was growing support in the Commons for holding a second referendum.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think the opposition parties and reaching across to Conservative MPs as well, I think there is still a majority in parliament to say to Boris Johnson that we will not accept a no-deal. </p> \n   <p>I think there is a gaining majority now to say we have to go back to the people in some form of public vote and that is, in my view, a referendum, that\u2019s the Labour party policy now, and therefore we are narrowing down the discussion into what then goes on the ballot paper.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He did not rule out the Labour party officially being neutral in any second referendum on Brexit.</strong> Labour has said it would go into a general election promising a referendum on Brexit, with voters given the choice between backing remain and a credible leave option. McDonnell said he personally would campaign for remain. But asked if he would be happy for the party as a whole to be \u201cagnostic\u201d on the issue, McDonnell replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>That\u2019s one of the issues we\u2019ve got to debate in the party. You know our democratic processes. I know people get frustrated with this ... but we\u2019re a democratic party.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Although most Labour members want to remain in the EU, the shadow cabinet is deeply divided on this issue and<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jun/19/tory-leadership-boris-johnson-result-vote-hunt-suggests-boris-johnson-cant-be-trust-to-keep-his-brexit-promises-live-news?page=with:block-5d0a52a98f081e872734aab8#block-5d0a52a98f081e872734aab8\"> there have been hints</a> before that Corbyn could resolve this tension by allowing Labour members to take either side in a second referendum, with the party machine staying neutral. This is broadly the approach Harold Wilson took in the 1975 referendum. Recently Corbyn told the shadow cabinet that he had been reading a Wilson biography to learn more about how the then prime minister handled that issue. </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>McDonnell said a future Labour government could hold a second referendum before negotiating a new Brexit deal with Europe.</strong> When this idea was put to him, he said this was \u201cone option\u201d being looked at. But he also said that, if the party decided to negotiate a new Brexit deal first, before putting it to the people, that process could be concluded relatively quickly. He rejected the suggestion it would take a year. He explained:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If you look at what\u2019s happened in the past, the reason it has dragged on in the negotiations in the past, to find out what is credible and what is not, is because the options that have been put forward have not been credible.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Here is the agenda for the day.<br></p> \n  <p><em>11am: </em>Jeremy Corbyn gives a speech on Labour\u2019s vision to rebuild Britain.</p> \n  <p><em>11am: </em>Number 10 lobby briefing.</p> \n  <p>And Boris Johnson is visiting a hospital in Cornwall at some point this morning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/18/johnson-urges-social-media-firms-to-block-anti-vaccine-messages\">to promote measures to increase the number of parents getting their children vaccinated.</a></p> \n  <p>As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has claimed that EU leaders will change their positions and allow the UK to scrap the Brexit backstop in the withdrawal agreement. Downing Street has rejected demands by MPs for a recall of parliament following the leak of damaging no-deal Brexit documents and will instead ask Michael Gove to brief the public on how to prepare over the coming weeks. Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell have left the door open to their party staying neutral in a second referendum if the choice were a Labour deal or remaining in the EU, as they pledged to do everything possible to stop the UK leaving without an agreement. Ending freedom of movement for EU citizens immediately after a no-deal Brexit would be reckless and could create a hostile environment for European nationals, a campaign group has said. Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s preference for holding another referendum on Scottish independence in the second half of next year has been put in doubt after the Electoral Commission recommended a gap of at least nine months between the completion of the required legislation and polling day. Boris Johnson has urged parents to ignore \u201csuperstitious mumbo jumbo on the internet\u201d and to get their children vaccinated. Speaking on a hospital visit intended to promote measures to increase vaccine uptake, he said: I think there\u2019s complacency on the part of parents about the need to get that second [MMR] vaccine but also, I\u2019m afraid, people have been listening to that superstitious mumbo jumbo on the internet, all that anti-vax stuff and thinking that the MMR vaccine is a bad idea. That\u2019s wrong. Please get your kids vaccinated because it\u2019s not just the right thing for them, but also of course it is the right thing for the whole population because it might not be your kid that gets it, it could be somebody else\u2019s. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Here is a question from below the line worth answering. Actually, under Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s offer to run a time-limited caretaker government, his only firm intention would be to negotiate an extension to Brexit and to then call an election. Why would he bother? I can think of plenty of reasons. 1) This would be a means of stopping a no-deal Brexit, which would earn Jeremy Corbyn, and Labour, great credit amongst remainers. It would also, they would say, be the right thing for the country. 2) If there is going to be an early election, there would be advantages for Corbyn to holding it with Brexit delayed - because the Tories would probably get crushed by the Brexit party. 3) An incumbent PM has many advantages in an election campaign. For example, s/he sets the date. And s/he can use the platform that government provides for party advantage, even though civil service resources are not meant to be spent on party political activity. Just look at the @10DowningStreet twitter feed, which reads like a Tory account even though it is a government one. 4) Being prime minister helps you look prime ministerial - which is particularly useful if, like Corbyn, you are thought not to be prime ministerial. 5) Even without a government majority, there is a lot a prime minister can do through prerogative powers, and through the use of patronage. 6) Prime ministers without a party majority have in the past managed to fight elections and come out with a majority (eg Wilson in 1974, Cameron in 2015). 7) No politician interested in changing Britain would turn down the chance to become PM - even for a short period. Tom Brake, the Lib Dem Brexit spokesman, says that if Jeremy Corbyn really intends to do \u201ceverything necessary\u201d to stop a no-deal Brexit, as he promised in his speech this morning, he must prove it. In a statement Brake said: Jeremy Corbyn must now deliver and prove this is not just an empty promise. If he truly wants to stop a no-deal, he must accept that he must not be prescriptive about how we ensure that happens. This is not about party leaders, but about stopping Boris Johnson from dragging us off the cliff-edge. It is clear Jeremy Corbyn cannot command a majority in the House. He must do the right thing and confirm that if he cannot, he will support someone who can. These are from the broadcaster Andrew Neil on Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s speech. And here is an extract from a blog covering it written by the New Statesman\u2019s Stephen Bush. If the Johnson gamble blows up in his face at an election, it will be in part be because that cultural halitosis surrounding the Tory party and poshness meant that he was unable to make significant breakthroughs in the likes of Bishop Auckland while still losing seats to the Liberal Democrats in the likes of Cheltenham. That\u2019s why Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s attack lines on Boris Johnson \u2013 wheeled out in his big speech today, which offered us a preview of Labour\u2019s preferred approach to an autumn election \u2013 are worth watching. Corbyn is talking up Johnson\u2019s membership of the elite and explicitly linking Johnson in with the Tory party and with wealth (of the nine mentions of Boris Johnson in Corbyn\u2019s speech, all were paired with a reference to his Conservativeness and his poshness). Boris Johnson will not get the chance to meet Jean-Claude Juncker, the outgoing president of the European commission, at this weekend\u2019s G7 summit, my colleague Jennifer Rankin reports. The EU is not a G7 country, but for some reason two of its presidents (president of the commission and president of the council - there are several others) normally attend, making it effectively a G9 meeting. Here\u2019s an extract from Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s speech. Boris Johnson has been in hyperactive campaign mode since becoming prime minister and some Labour figures have reportedly been complaining that Jeremy Corbyn has given him something of an easy ride. Today Corbyn responded with a lengthy and wide-ranging speech that set out the case Labour would put to the public in the general election widely expected within the next few weeks or months. You can read the full text here. It was clear and coherent, and as a round-up of Labour\u2019s policy offer, it was fine (although the party could probably still go a lot further in terms of boiling it down to a two or three-point message that everyone would remember). Johnson makes much of his ability to project optimism, and there was some evidence in the speech of Corbyn trying to respond in kind, for example when he spoke of the possible \u201cfantastic\u201d future available under Labour. (See 11.36am.) But exuberance isn\u2019t a Corbyn forte, and he was much better when he was critiquing the government. The best passage was probably the one where he described Johnson\u2019s spending announcements as an admission that Labour has won the argument on austerity (see 11.29am), and the points he made about crime and youth services that he used to back this up (see 11.31am). But you can\u2019t take down a government with a single speech, and so at best this was just a start. It may also have been infused with a bit of wishful thinking. Corbyn has often spoken in terms that suggest he wants to move on from Brexit and his speech contained a persuasive passage arguing that the problems facing the country go well beyond Brexit. (See 11.02am.) They do. But politicians have to campaign in the world as it is, on an agenda not always of their own choosing, and the Q&amp;A made it clear that the prospect of the next election not being dominated by Brexit seems remote. There is a summary of some of the main lines in the Corbyn speech here. And here is a summary of the main points from the Q&amp;A. Corbyn said any MPs serious about stopping a no-deal Brexit should back him to lead an interim government. Asked about calls for him to allow someone else to form a cross-party, interim government to block no deal, he replied: I am the leader of the opposition, the leader of the Labour party. All the constitutional precedents are, when a government collapses, it\u2019s the leader of the opposition that takes over. There seems to be an awful lot of very imaginative what iffery in the press at the present time. We will put a motion of no confidence in the government. We will do everything we can to stop a no deal Brexit. I have written to the leaders of all of the other opposition parties inviting them to join me in this and I simply say to them, and to those probably quite small number of Conservatives who are alarmed at the prospect of a no deal Brexit: \u201cIf you\u2019re serious about stopping an no-deal Brexit, then back my motion of no confidence to stop this government taking us over a cliff edge on the 31st October.\u201d Corbyn played down the prospect of MPs being able to stop a no-deal Brexit by any means other than using a no confidence vote to install him as an interim prime minister. He said: We offer to form a minority administration in order to give the people the choice in the future through a general election. That\u2019s what we\u2019re saying. That is the constitutional precedent. That is the norm. All this speculation about lots of other options - they actually don\u2019t exist. The option that exists is the constitutional precedent of the opposition taking over in order to facilitate an opportunity for an election campaign. This is slightly different from the line taken by John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, in his Today interview this morning in which he stressed that a no confidence motion was not the only means available to stop no deal. (See 9.33am.) He refused to commit to backing remain in a second referendum held by Labour after a general election. (See 11.55am.) He refused to rule out Labour officially remaining neutral in a second referendum on Brexit held after a general election. (See 11.46am.) He accused the media of bias, saying that if the UN had produced a report on conditions in the UK under a Labour government like the recent damning one produced by Philip Alston, the UN rapporteur on extreme poverty, there would have been uproar. He said: When the UN produces a report that says millions of people in the fifth richest country in the world are living in poverty, and it\u2019s getting worse - if that came out under Labour government, every media outlet in the land would be condemning us, and they would be right. Where\u2019s the voice against the Tories for doing that? In an interview in Cornwall during his hospital visit, Boris Johnson also said that the EU would have to compromise for there to be a Brexit deal. Asked whether progress would be made during his talks with Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron later this week, Johnson replied: Well that is, I\u2019m afraid, very much up to our friends and I hope that they will compromise. They have seen that the UK parliament has three times rejected the withdrawal agreement, the backstop just doesn\u2019t work, it\u2019s not democratic and I hope that they will see fit to compromise but in the meantime we get ready to come out on October 31. Here are the main points from this morning\u2019s Number 10 lobby briefing. Number 10 said the Operation Yellowhammer document about the impact of a no-deal Brexit leaked to the Sunday Times yesterday was \u201cout of date\u201d. The prime minister\u2019s spokeswoman said: \u201cWe are making all necessary preparations ahead of October 31\u201d. She went on: In relation to business we have been engaging widely and will continue to do so and that\u2019s been significantly stepped up in recent weeks. We have published numerous documents on how businesses can prepare. You can expect to see further information being published in the coming weeks in relation to how the public ... can further prepare and the changes that they are likely to see across a range of areas. The spokeswoman said that there would be an immediate change to the rules affecting EU nationals with criminal records wanting to enter the UK after 31 October. Commenting on a report claiming that Priti Patel, the home secretary, wants to end free movement for EU nationals immediately after 31 October, instead of withdrawing the right gradually as Theresa May\u2019s government intended, the Downing Street spokeswoman said \u201cfreedom of movement as it currently stands will end on October 31 when the UK leaves the EU.\u201d The spokeswoman went on: So for example we will introduce, immediately, much tougher criminality rules for people entering the UK. Details of other changes immediately on October 31 for a new immigration system are currently being developed. The prime minister has obviously been clear that we want to introduce an Australian-style points-based immigration system. The spokeswoman said Boris Johnson and Patel would set out more details of their plans shortly. The spokeswoman said Johnson would not agree to calls for parliament to be recalled. She said: The House of Commons agreed the date it would rise for summer recess, as well as its return on September 3 and this was passed by a majority of close to 200 MPs. Boris Johnson has been speaking to broadcasters on a visit to the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro, where he has been promoting measures to increase the number of parents getting their children vaccinated. Here are the key points he has been making. Johnson claimed he remained \u201cconfident\u201d that the EU would shift its position on the Northern Ireland backstop, allowing a Brexit deal to be agreed before 31 October. Asked about planning for no deal, he said: I\u2019m not going to suggest that there won\u2019t be - as I said on the steps of Downing Street - there may well be bumps in the road but we will be ready to come out on October 31 deal or no deal. Now of course our friends and partners on the other side of the Channel are showing a little bit of reluctance at the moment to change their position. That\u2019s fine - I\u2019m confident that they will - but in the meantime we have to get ready for a no deal outcome. I want a deal. We\u2019re ready to work with our friends and partners to get a deal but if you want a good deal for the UK, you must simultaneously get ready to come out without one. It is hard to see why Johnson is confident that the EU will back down because European leaders have been saying, almost unanimously and ad nauseam, that they are not willing to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement. He said the UK would be ready for a no-deal Brexit on 31 October if that proved necessary. Speaking about no-deal preparations, he said: If you look at the preparations the UK had made by March 29, we were very far advanced and things then slipped back a bit but we\u2019re very confident that by October 31 we will be ready and that\u2019s the crucial thing. I think that\u2019s what people want. People are very confident themselves that they can do it. I\u2019m not pretending that there won\u2019t be bumps on the road. There will be, I said that on the steps of Downing Street, but if everybody puts their minds to it I have absolutely no doubt that we can get ready. Here is the full text of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s speech in Corby. In his Q&amp;A Jeremy Corbyn would not commit to backing remain in a second referendum staged by Labour after a general election, and he would not rule out the party being neutral in such a contest. (See 11.46am and 11.55am.) But Corbyn has, of course, said that if there were a referendum now on a Tory Brexit, or on no deal, Labour would campaign for remain. I\u2019ve amended the wording in those earlier posts because they did not make that clear. Sorry. Corbyn says zero-hours contracts represent a return to the insecure labour conditions that used to apply to people working at the docks. Labour would end zero-hours contracts, he says. In response to a question from a Labour supporter who asked what Corbyn would do about the media who tell lies, Corbyn says he is a member of the NUJ. A free press is very important, he says. But he says he wants to ensure that reporting is balanced, and that people have a right to reply. He set out plans for media reform in a speech in Edinburgh last year. Those plans would form the basis for Labour\u2019s plans, he says. He says it is crucial that people who are attacked in the media get a right of reply. And that\u2019s it. I will post a summary shortly. Corbyn says he represents a constituency where only around a third of people own their own homes. He wants more council housing, he says. He says Margaret Thatcher\u2019s right to buy has led to a huge increase in the number of people having to rent from a private landlord. Corbyn says there has been a lot of speculation about what other mechanisms might be used to block a no-deal Brexit. But those options are not available yet, he says. The option that is available is a no confidence vote. Q: Why do you think so many Labour MPs do not see you as the right person to lead an interim government? Corbyn says he was elected Labour leader in 2015, to the surprise of the mainstream media. He was elected again in 2016. He is sure all Labour MPs want to join him in backing a no confidence motion against the government. Q: John McDonnell said this morning he would campaign for remain in a second referendum. Would you? And if not, can you see why remainers have doubts about your leadership? Corbyn says McDonnell was giving his personal view. He says the real issue is what must be done to end inequality in Britain. Corbyn refuses to commit to backing remain in a second referendum held by Labour after a general election, fuelling speculation that the party might officially remain neutral. (See 9.33am and 11.46am.) He says that if the UN produced a report about Britain under a Labour government as critical as the Philip Alston report was every media organisation would feature it very prominently. This gets a huge cheer from the Labour supporters in the audience. Corbyn says what happened to Northamptonshire council (it went bust) was symptomatic of how the Tories have underfunded local government. Corbyn is now taking questions. Q: You say you will do anything in your power to stop a no-deal Brexit. Would that include stepping aside as leader of a caretaker government? Labour supporters in the audience shout \u201cno\u201d. At least one person says the question is a disgrace. They also complain when a second journalist suggests Corbyn does not have enough support to become PM himself. Corbyn says he will do everthing to stop a no-deal Brexit. He is leader of the opposition, he says. All the precedent is that the leader of the opposition should be given the chance to form a government when the government falls. There is a lot of \u201cwhat iffery\u201d around, he says. He says if Tory MPs and others are serious about stopping no deal, they should support his no confidence motion. They should \u201cget on board\u201d, he says. Corbyn says all MPs opposed to no deal should back him as PM of an interim government. Q: Do you think parliament should be recalled immediately? Yes, shout Labour members in the audience. Corbyn says he does support the recall of parliament. Q: Could Labour remain neutral in a second referendum on Brexit? Corbyn says he wants to bring people together. There has to be an understanding of why particular communities voted leave. He is offering policies that would transform society, he says. He says Labour would make sure people have the final say and the final choice. Corbyn refuses to rule out Labour officially remaining neutral in a second referendum on Brexit held after a general election. Corbyn proposes a \u201cmassive injection of democracy\u201d. After years of elite-driven austerity and neglect, we will recharge our politics with a massive injection of democracy kicking out the big money interests and putting the people in the driving seat. And here is his peroration. We will drive up people\u2019s living standards by boosting pay, improving rights, and running our utilities and economy in the interests of the millions, not the multi-millionaires. And we will transform our communities with investment in every part of our country breathing new life into our high streets, giving security to older people and hope and opportunities to our young people. This is a historic moment, with the potential for real change to transform our country if we grasp the opportunity. Corbyn says the future could be \u201cfantastic\u201d under Labour. We can\u2019t afford more of the same, but even worse. The future could be fantastic. New technologies have the power to liberate us and help tackle the climate emergency. But for too many, the future is frightening and uncertain because those technologies have been used instead to benefit the wealthy elite while driving down pay and security for millions. The next Labour government will take on those who really run our country the bankers, tax dodgers and big polluters. So that the real wealth creators, the people of this country, can have the services, jobs and futures they deserve. Because when Labour wins, we all win. The nurse wins, the pensioner wins, the student wins, the office worker wins, the engineer wins, we all win. Corbyn turns to the climate crisis, and says Labour is that party that has shown real leadership on this. We ensured our parliament was the first in the world to declare a climate emergency. That must be followed by radical and decisive action that will only be delivered by a Labour government. It certainly won\u2019t come from the Tories the party that scrapped the Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon, effectively killing off new onshore wind power projects, and is forcing fracking on local communities who oppose it. Labour would restore public services, Corbyn says, because we understand they are the glue that binds society together. We\u2019ll restore pride in our NHS by funding it properly and end the sell-offs and privatisation. And we\u2019ll create a National Education Service providing free learning from the cradle to the grave including free school meals for all primary children smaller class sizes for five, six and seven-year-olds and no tuition fees at university or college. And he argues that Labour can be trusted to rebuild public services more than the Tories under Boris Johnson. Corbyn turns to the issue of crime to underline the point he has just been making. Take crime which the prime minister is now trying to turn to his political advantage, with yet more promises to tackle what the Tories have failed to bring under control for a decade. In the 2017 election, Labour won the argument that Tory cuts to the police had made people unsafe, and we pledged to hire more officers. The Conservatives have now conceded that we were right, but police cuts are not the only reason violent crime has doubled. What the Tories won\u2019t address is the much wider impact of austerity; the closed youth services; under-resourced mental healthcare; and the lack of funding for community mentoring. We take youth services so seriously that we will make it compulsory for local government to deliver them. Corbyn says Boris Johnson\u2019s recent spending announcements show that Labour has won the argument on austerity. The new prime minister has been making some pre-election spending pledges over the past few weeks. That shows Labour has won the argument that austerity damages our country and that it was always a political choice. But it insults voters\u2019 intelligence to expect them to be grateful for a bit of extra money here and there, with no confidence that it will actually be delivered when it\u2019s Boris Johnson\u2019s Tories who ran our public services into the ground in the first place. Corbyn summarises some Labour policies to address inequality. We\u2019ll introduce a real living wage of \u00a310 an hour, including for young people who deserve equal pay for equal work. But we need to go further. The problem with an unfair economy isn\u2019t just the imbalance of wealth; it\u2019s the imbalance of power. Labour will give working people more power to win better wages and have security at work. We\u2019ll put workers on company boards and give the workforce a 10% stake in large companies; paying a dividend of as much as \u00a3500 a year to each employee. And Labour won\u2019t tell people they have to work until they are 75 before getting their pension, as Iain Duncan Smith\u2019s think tank has suggested \u2013 a policy that discriminates against working class people \u2013 especially in manual jobs. It\u2019s past time that we rewrote the rules of the economy \u2013 to shift wealth and power \u2013 from a small elite at the top into the hands of the majority. He confirms Labour\u2019s intention to bring rail, mail, water and the national grid into public ownership. And the party would give more rights to tenants, he says, \u201cincluding controlling rents, so dodgy landlords can\u2019t rip them off\u201d. Corbyn says Labour would tackle inequality. But together, we can take our future into our own hands and tackle the great challenges facing our country alongside Brexit; inequality and an economy run for the richest; public services that have been stripped back and sold off; and the climate emergency threatening our children\u2019s future. Inequality holds all of us back. It means the talent of millions of people is squandered. We don\u2019t have to be a country of food banks and rough sleepers at one end while the super-rich dodge taxes at the other. And he says Labour would raise tax for the richest. Labour will raise tax for the richest and make sure they pay their share towards the common good. The Tories will cut tax for the richest. Labour will require the big multinational corporations to actually pay the tax they owe in this country. The Tories will cut tax for big corporations. It\u2019s Labour that will get more money into your pocket rather than line the pockets of multi-millionaires. Corbyn says Labour would offer a real change in direction. The Tories cannot be trusted to deliver on their quick-fix promises because their first priority is tax cuts for the big corporations and the richest. The Tories can\u2019t be trusted to deliver for the majority because they will always look after their own. Instead of fixing a failed system, they will turbocharge its inequalities, insecurities and climate destruction. Labour can be trusted to deliver to end austerity, to take on the elites and the vested interests holding people back and to transform our country for the many, not the few. Corbyn is now making the point about how a Labour government could offer \u201conce-in-a-generation change\u201d. But, instead of saying this could be \u201con the scale of 1945 or 1979\u201d, as he did in the extracts released in advance, he just said \u201con the scale of 1945\u201d. I don\u2019t think anyone assumed that the reference to 1979 meant he was planning to emulate Margaret Thatcher - he was making a point about the scale of change envisaged, not the type of change envisaged - but he seemed to be more comfortable leaving the reference to her out. Corbyn confirms his plan to call a no confidence vote. Labour will do everything we can to protect people\u2019s livelihoods. We will work together with the MPs from across parliament to pull our country back from the brink. I will bring a vote of no confidence in the government, and if we\u2019re successful, I would seek to form a time-limited caretaker administration to avert no deal, and call an immediate general election so the people can decide our country\u2019s future. If MPs are serious about stopping a no deal crash out, then they will vote down this reckless government and it falls to the leader of the opposition, to make sure no deal does not happen and the people decide their own future. Corbyn say, as we look to the return of parliament in September, the country is heading into a political storm. Boris Johnson is driving the country towards a no-deal cliff edge, he says. Labour will do everything necessary to stop that, he says. (See 11.02am.) Jeremy Corbyn is speaking now. He says the Pen Green children\u2019s centre, where he is speaking, was the inspiration for Labour\u2019s Sure Start programme. Beth Miller, Labour\u2019s candidate for Corby, is introducing Jeremy Corbyn at the Labour event now. Corby is a marginal constituency, currently held by the Conservative Tom Pursglove with a majority of 2,690. This is from Naomi Smith, the CEO of the anti-Brexit group Best for Britain, commenting on John McDonnell\u2019s interview this morning. (See 9.33am.) John McDonnell is right. There\u2019s no mandate for no-deal and the parliamentary gridlock can only be broken by asking the public where they now stand on Brexit. But when there is a public vote, Labour as a party cannot stay neutral. They must make the case for remaining in the EU. Their members and voters are unashamedly in favour of remaining and would be shocked to see the party adopt any other position. Jeremy Corbyn will be delivering his speech on Labour\u2019s vision for Britain in Corby shortly. There will be a live feed at the top of this blog. Here are some of the main points he will be making, based on extracts released by Labour overnight. Corbyn will say that Britain faces bigger problems than those posed by a no-deal Brexit. Labour would address these by offering radical change, as transformative as that introduced by Attlee or Thatcher, he will say. While Brexit is the framework of the crisis we face, the problems facing our country run much deeper. A general election triggered by the Tory Brexit crisis will be a crossroads for our country. It will be a once-in-a-generation chance for a real change of direction, potentially on the scale of 1945 or 1979. Things cannot go on as they were before. The Conservatives, and the wealthy establishment they represent, have failed our country. They have failed to protect living standards, savaged our public services, deepened inequality and failed to keep us safe. Boris Johnson and his hard right Tory cabinet have direct responsibility for the Tory decade of devastating damage done to our communities and the fabric of our society. However the Brexit crisis is resolved, the country faces a fundamental choice. Labour offers the real change of direction the country needs: a radical programme to rebuild and transform communities and public services, invest in the green jobs and high tech industries of the future, and take action to tackle inequality and climate crisis. He will dismiss Boris Johnson as a \u201cfake populist\u201d. The Tories have lurched to the hard right under Boris Johnson, Britain\u2019s Trump, the fake populist and phoney outsider, funded by the hedge funds and bankers, committed to protecting the vested interests of the richest and the elites, while posing as anti-establishment. He will argue that the next election will be fought on the issue of trust. The Tories under Boris Johnson cannot be trusted to deliver on their quick fix election promises - because their first priority is tax cuts for the big corporations and the richest. Boris Johnson and the Tories can\u2019t be trusted to deliver for the majority because they will always look after their own. Instead of fixing a failed system, they will turbocharge its inequalities, insecurities and climate destruction. Labour can be trusted to deliver: to end austerity, to take on the elites and the vested interests holding people back, and to transform our country for the many, not the few. Labour can be trusted to take the radical steps necessary to protect the environment and provide hope, decent jobs, secure homes, opportunity to every nation and region, and build a fairer country that works for all. He will accuse Boris Johnson of advocating a hard-right \u201cTrump deal Brexit\u201d. The Conservative party\u2019s failure on Brexit, and its lurch to the hard right, has provoked the crisis our country faces this autumn. After failing to negotiate a Brexit deal that would protect jobs and living standards, Boris Johnson\u2019s Tories are driving the country towards a no-deal cliff edge. We will do everything necessary to stop a disastrous no deal, for which this government has no mandate. Boris Johnson\u2019s government wants to use no deal to create a tax haven for the super-rich on the shores of Europe and sign a sweetheart trade deal with Donald Trump: not so much a no deal Brexit as a Trump deal Brexit. He will for a general election as the best way to resolve the Brexit crisis. Labour believes the decision on how to resolve the Brexit crisis must go back to the people. And if there is a general election this autumn, Labour would commit to holding a public vote, to give voters the final say, with credible options for both sides, including the option to remain. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, says that, like John McDonnell, should would also personally campaign for remain in any second referendum. The Green party\u2019s Caroline Lucas was one of the 100 MPs who signed the letter, coordinated by Luciana Berger and Stephen Doughty, calling for parliament to be recalled. In an interview with Today this morning she said the leak in the Sunday Times yesterday about Operation Yellowhammer, government planning for a no-deal Brexit, made a recall even more necessary. She explained: I think there is ever more evidence of the, frankly, impending national emergency that we are facing. MPs should be in parliament holding an increasingly reckless prime minister to account. Since his election as prime minister, Boris Johnson has been subject to, I think, about three hours of scrutiny, and yet he is putting his foot on the accelerator, driving the country off the cliff-edge as if he had a huge mandate and overwhelming support. Well he has no mandate for this. The government has a majority of precisely one. I think at a time of such emergency, the public are rightly saying \u2018Where are MPs? Where are they when it comes to holding this prime minister to account?\u2019. Yesterday Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister in charge of no-deal planning, said a no deal would lead to \u201cbumps in the road\u201d. Lucas told today it would be more likely to produce \u201ccavernous sink holes\u201d. She went on: Unless MPs get back into parliament and hold this prime minister to account, we are going to go into those sink holes and it\u2019s going to spell a disaster for this country. Good morning. We\u2019re in the depths of the summer recess, but with Jeremy Corbyn making a major speech on Labour\u2019s vision for Britain this morning, and Boris Johnson making his first visits to Berlin and Paris as prime minister later this week, Politics Live is back for the next few days to cover all the developments. Here is my colleague Rowena Mason\u2019s overnight preview of the Corbyn speech. This morning John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has been giving interviews ahead of it. Here are the main points from what he told the Today programme. McDonnell said Labour was backing the call made by 100 MPs, from all the opposition parties and from the Conservatives, for parliament to be recalled. Asked if Labour supported the initiative, he replied: I agree - I think it is a good initiative by this group of MPs to say that we need to get back into parliament. We are facing a critical issue here and should be debating it in parliament ... There is a need now to bring MPs back together again because we need time now to really have a proper debate and discussion about this matter. But MPs are not due to return to the Commons until a fortnight tomorrow, and parliament only gets recalled during a recess in response to a request from the government. And Number 10 is firmly ruling out a recall. McDonnell reaffirmed Labour\u2019s opposition to backing an interim government to stop a no-deal Brexit led by anyone other than Jeremy Corbyn. Asked to confirm that Labour would not support a vote in the Commons for someone else to lead an interim, cross-party government of this kind, McDonnell replied: No, we won\u2019t. We want to abide by the normal constitutional practice. Labour argues that, if the prime minister loses the confidence of the Commons, the normal procedure is for the leader of the opposition to be invited to form a government. McDonnell said Corbyn would host talks with other opposition party leaders next week to discuss what could be done to prevent a no-deal Brexit. He said: Jeremy is going to bring the [leaders] of the opposition parties together - he has already had some conversations - he will bring them together again next week and talk about how we go forward. We don\u2019t believe [having an interim government led by someone other than Corbyn] is a negotiable issue. McDonnell said that a no confidence vote, leading to the establishment of a new government, was not the only mechanism available to prevent a no-deal Brexit. He said: I think the big issue now is how do we prevent [no deal], and the no confidence motion is one mechanism. But, as Jeremy has said today, there\u2019s other mechanisms people are looking at, other parliamentary mechanisms, and we want to have a proper discussion and dialogue on a cross-party basis on what those mechanisms are. McDonnell claimed there was growing support in the Commons for holding a second referendum. He said: I think the opposition parties and reaching across to Conservative MPs as well, I think there is still a majority in parliament to say to Boris Johnson that we will not accept a no-deal. I think there is a gaining majority now to say we have to go back to the people in some form of public vote and that is, in my view, a referendum, that\u2019s the Labour party policy now, and therefore we are narrowing down the discussion into what then goes on the ballot paper. He did not rule out the Labour party officially being neutral in any second referendum on Brexit. Labour has said it would go into a general election promising a referendum on Brexit, with voters given the choice between backing remain and a credible leave option. McDonnell said he personally would campaign for remain. But asked if he would be happy for the party as a whole to be \u201cagnostic\u201d on the issue, McDonnell replied: That\u2019s one of the issues we\u2019ve got to debate in the party. You know our democratic processes. I know people get frustrated with this ... but we\u2019re a democratic party. Although most Labour members want to remain in the EU, the shadow cabinet is deeply divided on this issue and there have been hints before that Corbyn could resolve this tension by allowing Labour members to take either side in a second referendum, with the party machine staying neutral. This is broadly the approach Harold Wilson took in the 1975 referendum. Recently Corbyn told the shadow cabinet that he had been reading a Wilson biography to learn more about how the then prime minister handled that issue. McDonnell said a future Labour government could hold a second referendum before negotiating a new Brexit deal with Europe. When this idea was put to him, he said this was \u201cone option\u201d being looked at. But he also said that, if the party decided to negotiate a new Brexit deal first, before putting it to the people, that process could be concluded relatively quickly. He rejected the suggestion it would take a year. He explained: If you look at what\u2019s happened in the past, the reason it has dragged on in the negotiations in the past, to find out what is credible and what is not, is because the options that have been put forward have not been credible. Here is the agenda for the day. 11am: Jeremy Corbyn gives a speech on Labour\u2019s vision to rebuild Britain. 11am: Number 10 lobby briefing. And Boris Johnson is visiting a hospital in Cornwall at some point this morning to promote measures to increase the number of parents getting their children vaccinated. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "bodyText": "A huge collection of movie posters given to a London Underground electrician regarded by cinema staff as the capital\u2019s \u201cgreatest film fan\u201d is to be sold at a series of auctions for up to \u00a3100,000. Anthony Duggan started going to the cinema up to 200 times a year from the age of 16. On Thursdays, when films changed over, he would leave the house at 10am and return at midnight having seen three or four. He became such a familiar and well-liked figure among cinema staff that they would put aside posters of outgoing films for him. When Duggan died two years ago the Everyman cinema chain placed a replica Oscar with his name on it in every one of its foyers to celebrate his life. This week the Surrey auction house Ewbanks will hold the first in what will be a number of sales to disperse the 2,000 or so posters Duggan acquired, many of them rarities such as one promoting Revenge of the Jedi before it was retitled Return of the Jedi. Duggan\u2019s wife Helen recalled first meeting him in 1980 and seeing the wall of his bedroom, in his parents\u2019 house, covered in film posters. It was a sign of things to come. \u201cWe were married for 35 years and his passion for film never abated for a moment,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was a very outgoing and engaging personality and became very well known among cinema managers all around London \u2026 so many people adored him and his passion shone through.\u201d He also collected cinema memorabilia. \u201cWhen we first met,\u201d said Helen, \u201cI worked as an usherette and my family used to joke that what he was really after was my torch.\u201d So great was his passion, the auction house said, that cinema staff came to view him as \u201cLondon\u2019s greatest film fan\u201d. Duggan was born in 1954 and grew up in Uxbridge. His favourite films included the Clint Eastwood spaghetti western The Good, the Bad and the Ugly and Giuseppe Tornatore\u2019s sentimental love letter to movie-going, Cinema Paradiso. The first tranche of his posters going under the hammer will include such rarities as two Star Wars posters from the year of its release in 1977. One features a generic Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia who look nothing like the actors who played them. After the studio changed its mind it was replaced with one showing the actors Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, Alec Guinness and Peter Cushing. The other being sold was released before the Academy Awards and does not mention the seven Oscars it won. Both have an estimate of \u00a31,000-1,500 each. Other highlights include a poster for The Rocky Horror Picture Show promising \u201cgorgeous gals\u201d, \u201cthrills &amp; chills\u201d and \u201clotsa larfs &amp; sex\u201d; a poster for the Hammer parody Carry on Screaming showing damsel in distress Angela Douglas being carried away by the film\u2019s monster, Oddbod; and \u201cFrom the Master of Shock, A Shocking Masterpiece!\u201d, a poster for Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s Frenzy. James Bond features heavily in the sale, including Thunderball \u2013 \u201cBig, Brilliant Bondshell!\u201d; A View to a Kill \u2013 \u201cHas JAMES BOND finally met his match?\u201d; and a double bill of The Spy Who Loved Me and The Pink Panther Strikes Again \u2013 \u201cNobody Does it Better than Bond and the Panther Together!\u201d The auctions adviser, Ivan Macquisten, said the market for movie posters was a strong one, attracting film buffs as well as the general buyer who wanted a big and colourful talking point on their wall. \u201cThe great thing about posters as a market is that they are a gateway collectible to other areas of collecting,\u201d he said. \u201cYou get a lot of bang for your buck.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>At Green Man, the bucolic grounds unfurl to reveal a multisensory playground of literature, visual art and performance. You can find eclectic delights in every corner, and BBC Radio 6 Music-friendly fortysomethings navigate the spotless, hill-ringed site with similar fervour to the many infants that roam freely. Between stalls offering Japanese kumihimo braiding, tree ring printing and candle wax powered boats, the only gripe you could have is that you may miss more than you will see.</p> <p>Oh, and there\u2019s the music, too. In its 17-year history, Green Man has progressively twisted its folky image into exciting and intriguing new shapes, perhaps best displayed this year by the top billing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/11/four-tet-kieran-hebden-morning-evening-plastic-people\">Four Tet</a>.

      "body": "<p>While mulling over England\u2019s tactics for what would go down in history as the Bodyline series, Douglas Jardine watched a newsreel of Donald Bradman, his side\u2019s principal adversary, batting at the Oval in 1930. What particularly caught his eye was an incident in which a short ball from Harold Larwood hit the Australia hero on the chest. Examining it again and again, Jardine thought he saw Bradman flinch as the delivery bore down on him at high speed. His daughter remembered his comment. \u201cI\u2019ve got it \u2013 he\u2019s yellow,\u201d Jardine exclaimed and made his preparations accordingly.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/aug/18/brutal-jofra-archer-cricket-ashes-blows-concussion-england\">Brutal Jofra Archer leaves cricket reeling from his Ashes blows</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cricket would not be the same again. Although Bradman was not the principal victim of England\u2019s aggressive bowling in the 1932-33 series \u2013 most memorably, Bill Woodfull was hit over the heart and Bert Oldfield suffered a fractured skull from Larwood\u2019s deliveries \u2013 the touring team won the Ashes and intimidatory bowling was established as a useful and often controversial weapon in a Test captain\u2019s armoury.</p> <p>After Saturday, no one will ever accuse Steve Smith of being yellow. As Bradman\u2019s successor made his way from the Lord\u2019s pavilion back to the crease, having attempted to shake off the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/aug/17/jofra-archer-steve-smith-england-australia-ashes\" title=\"\">effect of a blow to his neck from Jofra Archer\u2019s 91mph bouncer</a>, many of those previously reluctant to applaud a player whose reputation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/28/steve-smith-david-warner-banned-one-year-cricket-australia-ball-tampering\" title=\"\">was tainted by the sandpaper scandal</a> could not refrain from admiring a gesture of such courage and obduracy.</p> <p>His duel with Archer, on which the fate of the series seemed to rest, was one to rank in English memories with Geoff Boycott versus Michael Holding in Bridgetown in 1981 or Mike Atherton fending off Allan Donald at Trent Bridge in 1998. Whether such a passage of play lasts six balls, as it did in Barbados, or just short of six hours, as in Nottingham, the atmosphere crackles with a special kind of electricity. Every watcher\u2019s system is flooded with the adrenaline that accompanies a blend of exhilaration and fear.</p> <p>Smith didn\u2019t last long after his return, although the image of the defiantly unorthodox swat for four off the second delivery he received from Chris Woakes will last almost as long in the memory as the sight of his figure lying on the ground earlier. The way he got out soon afterwards, leaving a straight ball, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/18/steve-smiths-test-concussion-reignites-debate-about-safety\" title=\"\">a surer sign of scrambled senses</a> than any reply he had previously given to the questions asked by his team doctor and specified in the latest iteration of the sport concussion assessment tool, starting with: \u201cWhat venue is this?\u201d</p> <p>Once further symptoms had become apparent the next day, there were plenty of commentators ready to insist that, given the recent emphasis throughout sport on dealing with concussion, he ought to have been prevented from resuming his innings. It was even said independent doctors should be brought in to make such assessments, insinuating team medics may be prone to setting aside their ethical judgment in the interests of a result.</p> <p>Sometimes, as with the Bodyline series or West Indies\u2019 rotation of four fast bowlers in the 1980s, relentless short-pitched fast bowling threatens the spirit of the game, prompting adjustments to the laws. But the physical threat posed by an individual fast bowler is a legitimate aspect of cricket and Archer versus Smith offered an elevated example of a hallowed genre. It was interesting that although Archer rattled a number of other batsmen\u2019s helmets during the course of the match the presence of Smith at the other end brought him to a peak of focused aggression.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a3d3cd086b34b8c5134d0c514cc60825bd5ec0d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a3d3cd086b34b8c5134d0c514cc60825bd5ec0d/0_0_3592_2410/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bill Woodfull of Australia ducks to avoid a rising ball from Harold Larwood of England during the Fourth Test match at Brisbane on the infamous \u2018Bodyline\u2019 Tour of Australia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"671\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bill Woodfull of Australia ducks to avoid a rising ball from Harold Larwood of England during the Fourth Test match at Brisbane on the infamous \u2018Bodyline\u2019 Tour of Australia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Central Press/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By returning to the crease, Smith certainly put himself at risk of the second blow that medical opinion now sees as providing an enhanced threat to a concussed player. But he also provided us with an example of the sort of courage without which a sport such as cricket is not really worth the candle.</p> <p>Helmets and other forms of padding offer batsmen far more protection than their predecessors enjoyed against Larwood, Ray Lindwall or Wes Hall. Yet the challenge they face has changed very little: the ball still weighs five and a half ounces, the pitch is still 22 yards long, and fast bowlers still bowl in the same 90mph range as their distant ancestors, despite much more advanced physical conditioning. Watching Smith\u2019s assertive reaction to Archer\u2019s fusillade on Saturday, David Gower observed that 30 years ago the technique of evasion would have been very different; time, in that sense, has tilted the odds in the batsman\u2019s favour.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/19/england-unchanged-third-ashes-test-headingley-australia-wait-steve-smith-concussion\">England unchanged for third Ashes Test while Australia wait on Steve Smith</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some sports will always contain an inherent danger to life and limb, and reducing the threat in line with changing attitudes to risk is inevitable. Given the increasing reluctance of parents to allow their children to play rugby union, the authorities are right to consider amendments to the rules on tackling. But even in this safety-conscious era the only way of providing a guarantee against deaths such as those of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/jul/22/jules-bianchi-formula-one-risk\" title=\"\">the grand prix driver Jules Bianchi</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/23/maxim-dadashev-russian-boxer-dies-injuries-fight\" title=\"\">the boxer Maxim Dadashev</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/05/bjorn-lambrecht-dies-aged-22-crash-tour-of-poland-cycling\" title=\"\">the cyclist Bjorg Lambrecht</a> is to ban those sports completely \u2013 which some, no doubt, would do.</p> <p>The next time we see Smith make his way to the crease, he will probably be wearing the neck guards on his helmet and the forearm protector that would have reduced the damage from the two blows he suffered on Saturday. Withholding his return from Thursday\u2019s Test at Headingley would seem, on the evidence so far, to be a wise choice. But next month at Old Trafford or the Oval the second instalment of his contest with Archer will be awaited with even keener anticipation than the first, which gave us a new page of cricket history.</p>",

      "bodyText": "While mulling over England\u2019s tactics for what would go down in history as the Bodyline series, Douglas Jardine watched a newsreel of Donald Bradman, his side\u2019s principal adversary, batting at the Oval in 1930. What particularly caught his eye was an incident in which a short ball from Harold Larwood hit the Australia hero on the chest. Examining it again and again, Jardine thought he saw Bradman flinch as the delivery bore down on him at high speed. His daughter remembered his comment. \u201cI\u2019ve got it \u2013 he\u2019s yellow,\u201d Jardine exclaimed and made his preparations accordingly. Cricket would not be the same again. Although Bradman was not the principal victim of England\u2019s aggressive bowling in the 1932-33 series \u2013 most memorably, Bill Woodfull was hit over the heart and Bert Oldfield suffered a fractured skull from Larwood\u2019s deliveries \u2013 the touring team won the Ashes and intimidatory bowling was established as a useful and often controversial weapon in a Test captain\u2019s armoury. After Saturday, no one will ever accuse Steve Smith of being yellow. As Bradman\u2019s successor made his way from the Lord\u2019s pavilion back to the crease, having attempted to shake off the effect of a blow to his neck from Jofra Archer\u2019s 91mph bouncer, many of those previously reluctant to applaud a player whose reputation was tainted by the sandpaper scandal could not refrain from admiring a gesture of such courage and obduracy. His duel with Archer, on which the fate of the series seemed to rest, was one to rank in English memories with Geoff Boycott versus Michael Holding in Bridgetown in 1981 or Mike Atherton fending off Allan Donald at Trent Bridge in 1998. Whether such a passage of play lasts six balls, as it did in Barbados, or just short of six hours, as in Nottingham, the atmosphere crackles with a special kind of electricity. Every watcher\u2019s system is flooded with the adrenaline that accompanies a blend of exhilaration and fear. Smith didn\u2019t last long after his return, although the image of the defiantly unorthodox swat for four off the second delivery he received from Chris Woakes will last almost as long in the memory as the sight of his figure lying on the ground earlier. The way he got out soon afterwards, leaving a straight ball, was a surer sign of scrambled senses than any reply he had previously given to the questions asked by his team doctor and specified in the latest iteration of the sport concussion assessment tool, starting with: \u201cWhat venue is this?\u201d Once further symptoms had become apparent the next day, there were plenty of commentators ready to insist that, given the recent emphasis throughout sport on dealing with concussion, he ought to have been prevented from resuming his innings. It was even said independent doctors should be brought in to make such assessments, insinuating team medics may be prone to setting aside their ethical judgment in the interests of a result. Sometimes, as with the Bodyline series or West Indies\u2019 rotation of four fast bowlers in the 1980s, relentless short-pitched fast bowling threatens the spirit of the game, prompting adjustments to the laws. But the physical threat posed by an individual fast bowler is a legitimate aspect of cricket and Archer versus Smith offered an elevated example of a hallowed genre. It was interesting that although Archer rattled a number of other batsmen\u2019s helmets during the course of the match the presence of Smith at the other end brought him to a peak of focused aggression. By returning to the crease, Smith certainly put himself at risk of the second blow that medical opinion now sees as providing an enhanced threat to a concussed player. But he also provided us with an example of the sort of courage without which a sport such as cricket is not really worth the candle. Helmets and other forms of padding offer batsmen far more protection than their predecessors enjoyed against Larwood, Ray Lindwall or Wes Hall. Yet the challenge they face has changed very little: the ball still weighs five and a half ounces, the pitch is still 22 yards long, and fast bowlers still bowl in the same 90mph range as their distant ancestors, despite much more advanced physical conditioning. Watching Smith\u2019s assertive reaction to Archer\u2019s fusillade on Saturday, David Gower observed that 30 years ago the technique of evasion would have been very different; time, in that sense, has tilted the odds in the batsman\u2019s favour. Some sports will always contain an inherent danger to life and limb, and reducing the threat in line with changing attitudes to risk is inevitable. Given the increasing reluctance of parents to allow their children to play rugby union, the authorities are right to consider amendments to the rules on tackling. But even in this safety-conscious era the only way of providing a guarantee against deaths such as those of the grand prix driver Jules Bianchi, the boxer Maxim Dadashev and the cyclist Bjorg Lambrecht is to ban those sports completely \u2013 which some, no doubt, would do. The next time we see Smith make his way to the crease, he will probably be wearing the neck guards on his helmet and the forearm protector that would have reduced the damage from the two blows he suffered on Saturday. Withholding his return from Thursday\u2019s Test at Headingley would seem, on the evidence so far, to be a wise choice. But next month at Old Trafford or the Oval the second instalment of his contest with Archer will be awaited with even keener anticipation than the first, which gave us a new page of cricket history.",

Thirty years have passed since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2015/apr/17/my-favourite-cannes-winner-sex-lies-and-videotape\">sex, lies and videotape</a> landed in cinemas \u2013 a cool, scuzzy alien object relative to much of what was filling American arthouses at the time \u2013 and trying to put a label on \u201cmost of the things\u201d Soderbergh has done since is a fool\u2019s errand. You have to squint pretty hard, for example, to see the line connecting this sharp, nasty, sensual comedy of bad suburban manners with, say, the neon popcorn swagger of the director\u2019s Ocean\u2019s Eleven films, or his sprawling, brawny two-part Che Guevara biopic. Perhaps more of its minimalist DNA is evident in his glassy sci-fi remake Solaris, his loosey-goosey stripper study Magic Mike or his Oscar-winning drug trade cat\u2019s-cradle Traffic, but you have to overlook a lot of switching in genre and scale to identify sex, lies and videotape (or indeed any individual Soderbergh film) as typical. Two people in a room, maybe, but the size, decor and acoustics of that room have proven as variable as can be.</p> <p>If Soderbergh has spent a rich and unpredictable career avoiding a replica of the film that made his name, that\u2019s entirely understandable: in three decades, sex, lies and videotape has been so extensively cited and imitated \u2013 both in terms of its own aesthetics and outlook, and as an industry business model \u2013 by other film-makers that it hardly needs a signal boost from its own creator. It is often all too easy for casual film historians to credit single films as seismic Hollywood game-changers, but it\u2019s hard to overestimate the extent to which Soderbergh\u2019s debut changed the course, or even the definition, of American independent cinema.</p> <p>Just 25 when he shot sex, lies and videotape, Soderbergh had no intention of making something revolutionary. The film, a modestly formed but piercingly observed study of an unhappily married couple who relationship is further ruptured by the intervention of an unnerving, sexually dysfunctional drifter, wears its own influences, from Rohmer to Roeg, on its sleeve. It\u2019s acutely written and beautifully acted, but the kind of talky, rarefied miniature that could easily have gone nowhere beyond the film festival circuit. Soderbergh\u2019s initial plan was to shoot it in black-and-white, until less esoteric instincts prevailed.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smDd75zQSwg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/smDd75zQSwg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Nothing in the $1.2m film, in other words, was especially calculated to meet with the immediately excited reception it got: indeed, Soderbergh expected it might be a straight-to-video affair. But at the sixth Sundance film festival, then a far small institution than the heavy indie market it is today, it won the audience award; months later, selected for competition at Cannes only after another film dropped out, it landed the Palme d\u2019Or from a jury headed by Wim Wenders, beating such titles as Do the Right Thing and Cinema Paradiso in the process. (Not bad for a film that had to be promoted from the lower-profile directors\u2019 fortnight sidebar; today, Cannes doesn\u2019t permit other festival premieres in its competition lineup.)</p> <p>The prizes were all well and good, though no guarantee of sleeper box-office success; it was when they were bought by Harvey and Bob Weinstein\u2019s then 10-year-old Miramax Films that its fortunes rose. (Other names in the hunt were, improbably enough, action-movie merchants Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson: such was the volume of buzz around this tiny talkfest.) The Weinsteins were already adept in the aggressive marketing expertise for which they eventually became a byword; releasing the film in summer with sexy marketing materials and breathlessly quote-laden ads, they hyped it all the way to $25m at the US box office \u2013 a tenth of what Tim Burton\u2019s Batman scared up that year, but a remarkable sum for a film that never expanded beyond 534 screens across the country.</p> <p>For Miramax, it was the release that finally put them on the map, raking in three times the gross of the company\u2019s previous best performer, the Profumo biopic Scandal, and announcing them as the hippest name in independent cinema. It similarly elevated the standing of Sundance, which had until then been chugging along with low-key indies that rarely broke out in a big way; Soderbergh\u2019s film was the first to inspire heated bidding among distributors in Park City, now annually reported as the true measure of the festival\u2019s success.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3ace34c83b4f1f762f79681bd250151c954885ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ace34c83b4f1f762f79681bd250151c954885ae/0_0_2352_1555/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Spader and Andie MacDowell in sex, lies and videotape.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"661\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Spader and Andie MacDowell in sex, lies and videotape.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Everett Collection/REX</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As \u201cindependent film\u201d became a more mainstream concept in the 1990s, these two institutions were the chief architects of that change \u2013 yet sex, lies and videotape, the film that made them, wasn\u2019t quite the blueprint they stuck to. Sundance would gradually acquire a reputation for more wholesome, socially conscious or cutely quirky fare, while Miramax, too, pursued the more polite form of prestige cinema that would eventually make them an awards magnet. It was telling that, despite the popularity of Soderbergh\u2019s film with critics and audiences, Weinstein\u2019s campaigning only netted it a single Oscar nomination for its screenplay, while they had far more success the same year with a tour-de-force disability biopic, My Left Foot. Soderbergh\u2019s film was a trailblazer, yet a little too clever, a little too chilly, for that kind of Hollywood embrace. Even Andie MacDowell, the film\u2019s breakout star, was swiftly channelled into lighter, brighter romantic comedies.</p> <p>Today, it\u2019s easy to point out the American film-makers whose careers were enabled by Soderbergh\u2019s early success, by the film\u2019s low-budget fluidity of form, dark sensuality and unashamed, European-style chattiness: to imagine American cinema without it is also to imagine the industry without Todd Solondz, Noah Baumbach, Lisa Cholodenko or the entire mumblecore movement in its wake. Yet you rarely see any American films quite like sex, lies and videotape being made today, particularly as even indies have grown more sex-shy in the 21st century, and it\u2019s all but impossible to imagine one rustling up $25m at the box office.</p> <p>Thirty years is longer than a generation, after all. With the Weinsteins now a past-tense force, and A24 holding the prestige Miramax once had, independent cinema is now a different landscape, complete with new leaders, new challenges and new films as yardsticks of success. Meanwhile, the looming shadow of Netflix \u2013 a platform that almost certainly would bid for sex, lies and videotape were it unveiled to similar acclaim today \u2013 is forcing an industry-wide reappraisal of what an independent film is and where it can thrive.</p> <p>Earlier this year, Soderbergh released High Flying Bird, a tart, snappy sports-business satire that often boils down to two people in a room, exclusively on Netflix; in a few weeks, his Meryl Streep-starring political drama The Laundromat will play the festival circuit under the streaming giant\u2019s banner. Soderbergh has long proven adaptable in these matters. His brief \u201cretirement\u201d from filmmaking was announced after he made his lavishly cinematic Liberace biopic Behind the Candelabra for HBO, while in 2005, one year after Ocean\u2019s Twelve stormed global multiplexes, he released the microbudget experiment Bubble simultaneously in cinemas and on a cable network. It was a then innovative multiplatform strategy that is now standard for any small-scale indie entering the market. Some of the industry changes sex, lies and videotape ushered in are still with us; others are facing new, uncertain revisions in form and function. Soderbergh, somehow, is again in that vanguard.</p>",

If Soderbergh has spent a rich and unpredictable career avoiding a replica of the film that made his name, that\u2019s entirely understandable: in three decades, sex, lies and videotape has been so extensively cited and imitated \u2013 both in terms of its own aesthetics and outlook, and as an industry business model \u2013 by other film-makers that it hardly needs a signal boost from its own creator. It is often all too easy for casual film historians to credit single films as seismic Hollywood game-changers, but it\u2019s hard to overestimate the extent to which Soderbergh\u2019s debut changed the course, or even the definition, of American independent cinema. Just 25 when he shot sex, lies and videotape, Soderbergh had no intention of making something revolutionary. The film, a modestly formed but piercingly observed study of an unhappily married couple who relationship is further ruptured by the intervention of an unnerving, sexually dysfunctional drifter, wears its own influences, from Rohmer to Roeg, on its sleeve. It\u2019s acutely written and beautifully acted, but the kind of talky, rarefied miniature that could easily have gone nowhere beyond the film festival circuit. Soderbergh\u2019s initial plan was to shoot it in black-and-white, until less esoteric instincts prevailed. Nothing in the $1.2m film, in other words, was especially calculated to meet with the immediately excited reception it got: indeed, Soderbergh expected it might be a straight-to-video affair. But at the sixth Sundance film festival, then a far small institution than the heavy indie market it is today, it won the audience award; months later, selected for competition at Cannes only after another film dropped out, it landed the Palme d\u2019Or from a jury headed by Wim Wenders, beating such titles as Do the Right Thing and Cinema Paradiso in the process. (Not bad for a film that had to be promoted from the lower-profile directors\u2019 fortnight sidebar; today, Cannes doesn\u2019t permit other festival premieres in its competition lineup.) The prizes were all well and good, though no guarantee of sleeper box-office success; it was when they were bought by Harvey and Bob Weinstein\u2019s then 10-year-old Miramax Films that its fortunes rose. (Other names in the hunt were, improbably enough, action-movie merchants Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson: such was the volume of buzz around this tiny talkfest.) The Weinsteins were already adept in the aggressive marketing expertise for which they eventually became a byword; releasing the film in summer with sexy marketing materials and breathlessly quote-laden ads, they hyped it all the way to $25m at the US box office \u2013 a tenth of what Tim Burton\u2019s Batman scared up that year, but a remarkable sum for a film that never expanded beyond 534 screens across the country. For Miramax, it was the release that finally put them on the map, raking in three times the gross of the company\u2019s previous best performer, the Profumo biopic Scandal, and announcing them as the hippest name in independent cinema. It similarly elevated the standing of Sundance, which had until then been chugging along with low-key indies that rarely broke out in a big way; Soderbergh\u2019s film was the first to inspire heated bidding among distributors in Park City, now annually reported as the true measure of the festival\u2019s success. As \u201cindependent film\u201d became a more mainstream concept in the 1990s, these two institutions were the chief architects of that change \u2013 yet sex, lies and videotape, the film that made them, wasn\u2019t quite the blueprint they stuck to. Sundance would gradually acquire a reputation for more wholesome, socially conscious or cutely quirky fare, while Miramax, too, pursued the more polite form of prestige cinema that would eventually make them an awards magnet. It was telling that, despite the popularity of Soderbergh\u2019s film with critics and audiences, Weinstein\u2019s campaigning only netted it a single Oscar nomination for its screenplay, while they had far more success the same year with a tour-de-force disability biopic, My Left Foot. Soderbergh\u2019s film was a trailblazer, yet a little too clever, a little too chilly, for that kind of Hollywood embrace. Even Andie MacDowell, the film\u2019s breakout star, was swiftly channelled into lighter, brighter romantic comedies. Today, it\u2019s easy to point out the American film-makers whose careers were enabled by Soderbergh\u2019s early success, by the film\u2019s low-budget fluidity of form, dark sensuality and unashamed, European-style chattiness: to imagine American cinema without it is also to imagine the industry without Todd Solondz, Noah Baumbach, Lisa Cholodenko or the entire mumblecore movement in its wake. Yet you rarely see any American films quite like sex, lies and videotape being made today, particularly as even indies have grown more sex-shy in the 21st century, and it\u2019s all but impossible to imagine one rustling up $25m at the box office. Thirty years is longer than a generation, after all. With the Weinsteins now a past-tense force, and A24 holding the prestige Miramax once had, independent cinema is now a different landscape, complete with new leaders, new challenges and new films as yardsticks of success. Meanwhile, the looming shadow of Netflix \u2013 a platform that almost certainly would bid for sex, lies and videotape were it unveiled to similar acclaim today \u2013 is forcing an industry-wide reappraisal of what an independent film is and where it can thrive. Earlier this year, Soderbergh released High Flying Bird, a tart, snappy sports-business satire that often boils down to two people in a room, exclusively on Netflix; in a few weeks, his Meryl Streep-starring political drama The Laundromat will play the festival circuit under the streaming giant\u2019s banner. Soderbergh has long proven adaptable in these matters. His brief \u201cretirement\u201d from filmmaking was announced after he made his lavishly cinematic Liberace biopic Behind the Candelabra for HBO, while in 2005, one year after Ocean\u2019s Twelve stormed global multiplexes, he released the microbudget experiment Bubble simultaneously in cinemas and on a cable network. It was a then innovative multiplatform strategy that is now standard for any small-scale indie entering the market. Some of the industry changes sex, lies and videotape ushered in are still with us; others are facing new, uncertain revisions in form and function. Soderbergh, somehow, is again in that vanguard.",

Instead, they have the strength of character to overcome. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of focus on why serial killers become violent,\u201d Clark notes. \u201cBut why do some people survive their traumatic upbringing? There\u2019s very little focus on the other side of the coin. That, in my opinion, would be a very worthwhile study.\u201d And perhaps good television, too. Mindhunter 2 is available on Netflix",

China controls another part in the east.<br></p>\n    <p>India and Pakistan have gone to war a further two times over Kashmir, most recently in 1999. Artillery, mortar and small arms fire are still frequently exchanged.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How did the dispute start?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>After the partition of colonial India in 1947, small, semi-autonomous \u2018princely states\u2019 across the subcontinent were being folded into India or Pakistan. The ruler of Kashmir dithered over which to join until tribal fighters entered from Pakistan intent on taking the region for Islamabad.</p>\n    <p>Kashmir asked Delhi for assistance, signing a treaty of accession in exchange for the intervention of Indian troops, who fought the Pakistanis to the modern-day line of control.</p>\n    <p>In 1948, the UN security council called for a referendum in Kashmir to determine which country the region would join or whether it would become an independent state. The referendum has never been held.</p>\n    <p>In its 1950 constitution, India granted Kashmir a large measure of independence. But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was Kashmir\u2019s special status?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Kashmir\u2019s special status, given in exchange for joining the Indian union, had been in place since 14 May 1954. Under article 370, the state was given a separate constitution, a flag, and autonomy over all matters except for foreign affairs and defence.&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p>An additional provision, article 35a, prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believed this was crucial to protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority state and its way of life.</p>\n    <p>The ruling Bharatiya Janata party repeatedly promised to scrap such rules, a long-term demand of its Hindu nationalist support base. But analysts warned doing so would almost certainly ignite unrest.</p>\n    <p>On Wednesday 31 October 2019, the government formally revoked Kashmir\u2019s special status. The government argued that the provision had&nbsp; only ever intended to be temporary and that scrapping it would boost investment in Kashmir. Critics, however, said the move would escalate tensions with Pakistan \u2013 which quickly called India\u2019s actions illegal \u2013 and fuel resentment in Kashmir, where there is an insurgency against Indian rule.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do the militants want?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades. Indian soldiers and Pakistan-backed guerrillas fought a war rife with accusations of torture, forced disappearances and extra-judicial killing.<br></p>\n    <p>Until 2004, the militancy was made up largely of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. Since then, especially after protests were quashed with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/08/india-crackdown-in-kashmir-is-this-worlds-first-mass-blinding\">extreme force</a>&nbsp;in 2016, locals have made up a growing share of the anti-India fighters.</p>\n    <p>For Indians, control of Kashmir \u2013 part of the country\u2019s only Muslim-majority state \u2013 has been proof of its commitment to religious pluralism. For Pakistan, a state founded as a homeland for south Asian Muslims, it is the last occupied home of its co-religionists. <br><b><br>Michael Safi and Rebecca Ratcliffe</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>On Monday, very few pupils arrived at any of the 190 schools that had opened in Srinagar. \u201cIt is a risk.

John Landgraf, the chief executive of the US channel FX, used to work on Friends, and when he was reviewing footage from the pilot of his upcoming post-apocalyptic drama Y: The Last Man, he was struck by a familiar face. \u201cI recognise that monkey!\u201d, he said at an industry party this summer. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like a really experienced actor who knows how to hit their marks!\u201d And was he right? He was: Katie plays Ampersand, the primate companion of the last man on Earth. Are you sure Katie hasn\u2019t acted much? I feel like I see her all the time. You\u2019ve probably seen some of the many other monkey actors. Wasn\u2019t she in The Hangover 2 and the Night at the Museum films? No, that was the wildly successful Crystal, who also had major roles in the sitcoms Community and Animal Practice. Ah. So we really haven\u2019t seen Ross\u2019s monkey in years? According to IMDb, Katie\u2019s last TV role was in 2013 \u2013 although she has found work as a mascot for the LA Angels baseball team. Well, a comeback after all this time isn\u2019t to be sniffed at. It\u2019s nice to know some areas of the entertainment business are immune to ageism, isn\u2019t it? Yes, good for Katie. Quite. But there may be a hitch. Although she had a role in the pilot of Y: The Last Man, her job is by no means secure. A recent change of showrunner could mean that, when the series debuts next year, she\u2019ll be replaced with an animated version. It\u2019s a cruel business. She\u2019s better off out of it, really. Do say: \u201cThis just goes to show that performers really can move on from something as era-defining as Friends.\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cUnless you\u2019re the guy who played Gunther, obviously.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>As a card-carrying member of the BeyHive, I attended two On The Run II concerts last summer. At the London concert, Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9 surprised the world with their single APESHIT. There Jay-Z <a href=\"https://genius.com/The-carters-apeshit-lyrics\">raps</a>, \u201cI said no to the Superbowl. You need me don\u2019t need you. Every night we in the endzone.

These tributes were reminiscent of the black boy dancing in front of militarized police officers in Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Formation video two years before. She later performed the single at Super Bowl half-time, accompanied by black women wearing black power outfits with berets. The anti-capitalist aims of the Black Panther party loomed in contrast to the <a href=\"https://genius.com/Beyonce-formation-lyrics\">lyrics</a>: \u201cI just might be a black Bill Gates in the making\u201d and \u201cAlways stay gracious, best revenge is your paper.\u201d Now, as part of the new, multi-year deal with the National Football League, Jay-Z will produce the Super Bowl halftime show, to the dismay of many activists.</p> <p>The NFL is blackballing former San Francisco 49ers quarterback and Super Bowl champion contender Colin Kaepernick for kneeling during the national anthem as a protest against police violence. Kaepernick inspired others to kneel, protest, boycott and organize. He has given more than a <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jerrybarca/2018/02/01/colin-kaepernick-not-stopping-donations-roll-past-1-million/\">million</a> dollars to social justice organizations. Thousands have <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/boycott-nfl-gains-steam-celebrities-leaders-keith-ellison-946392\">boycotted</a> watching or attending football games and several celebrities declined to perform at the big half-time show. Given this, Jay-Z\u2019s steps crossed a picket line. It stings. The announcement came days after the fifth anniversary of Michael Brown\u2019s killing by a police officer.</p> <p>Perhaps Jay-Z thinks he can profit from both sides of the picket line. He is a quintessential black capitalist: professing that freedom is one\u2019s ability to own oneself and acquire wealth. Many people are surprised at best; betrayed at worst. Such reactions are less about whether he <em>could</em> broker this deal, and more of a disappointment in Jay-Z\u2019s possible, yet woefully incomplete, political evolution. This reflects a similar American surprise that featured prominently in the last presidential election. We knew that the country had white supremacists; we didn\u2019t expect that one would <em>actually</em> be elected that Tuesday.</p> <p>During the press conference, Jay-Z <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/08/jay-z-helps-nfl-banish-colin-kaepernick/596146/\">preempted</a> criticism: \u201cI think that we forget that Colin\u2019s whole thing was to bring attention to social injustice, correct? So, in that case, this is a success; this is the next thing. \u2019Cause there\u2019s two parts of protesting. You go outside and you protest, and then the company or the individual says, \u2018I hear you. What do we do next?\u2019 So, for me, it was like, action, actionable item, what are we going to do with it? Everyone heard and we hear what you\u2019re saying, and everybody knows I agree with what you\u2019re saying. So what are we going to do? So we should, millions of millions of people, and all we get stuck on Colin not having a job. I think we\u2019re past kneeling. I think it\u2019s time for action.\u201d</p> <p>If we accept Jay-Z distinction between protest and action, why does he think that the \u201cnext steps\u201d lie within a group of corporate billionaires? It does not. Hundreds of grassroots organizations have released statements and shared visions for liberation for all oppressed people. The Movement for Black Lives released a comprehensive <a href=\"https://policy.m4bl.org/\">policy platform</a>. Dream Defenders <a href=\"https://www.dreamdefenders.org/freedompapers\">dropped</a> Freedom Papers and successfully organized against private prisons in Florida. There are campaigns to #CloseRikers in New York City, #<a href=\"https://www.closetheworkhouse.org/\">CloseTheWorkhouse</a> in St Louis, and #AbolishIce across the country. Organizers have bailed out <a href=\"https://nationalbailout.org/\">Black mothers</a>, stopped prison construction, and prevented city councils from investing more money in police.</p> <p>NFL players have organized, too. In<em> </em>Things that Make White People Uncomfortable, activist and defensive end Michael Bennett emphasizes that activist-athletes, not team owners, create the most progressive change both on and off the field. They have protested, written statements, and created athlete impact organizations. Here is the irony: the NFL does not even care about the black athletes that make the sport a multibillion dollar industry.</p> <p>Black legs matter; black lives don\u2019t.</p> <p>So why this move from Jay? From 2014 to 2017, the Black Lives Matter movement was at peak visibility. Scholars and organizers used The Carters\u2019 artistry to teach about activism. Many people were affirmed by the display of black culture, sounds, and calls for freedom. The art reflected the times, but times are changing. Now, bipartisanship is on display.</p> <p>Liberals are attempting to work across the aisle to accomplish <em>anything</em> and call it progress. This explains the strange criminal justice alliances between a founder of Color of Change, Van Jones; the Koch Brothers, conservative billionaires; Robert Kraft, a Trump supporter and the NFL Patriots\u2019 owner; rapper Meek Mill; and Jay-Z. The Koch brothers only became interested in criminal justice reform after their oil company was indicted on <a href=\"https://www.cut50.org/the_atlantic_do_the_koch_brothers_really_care_about_criminal_justice_reform\">97 felony violations of environmental law</a>.</p> <p>Van Jones is signed to Jay-Z\u2019s Roc Nation, is the president of the Reform Alliance (funded by Jay-Z and Robert Kraft), and was the premiere champion of the First Step Act, an <a href=\"https://www.themarshallproject.org/2019/03/12/first-step-act-comes-up-short-in-trump-s-2020-budget\">underfunded</a>, moderate criminal justice package that a coalition of more than 150 black-led social justice organizations <a href=\"https://policy.m4bl.org/2018/12/the-movement-for-black-lives-position-on-the-first-step-act/\">opposed</a>. The coalition called the bill \u201ccustom-made for rich white men\u201d. After Trump signed it, Jones <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/11/15/van-jones-praised-trump-criminal-justice-reform-now-hes-taking-heat-left/\">tweeted</a> that the white nationalist president was \u201con his way to becoming the uniter-in-Chief\u201d. Jones is also working with the Koch brothers around prison reform.</p> <p>Yet, I empathize with Jay-Z. I understand how someone from Marcy Houses projects would tell black people that \u201cfinancial freedom [is their] only hope.\u201d His work around Meek Mill, 21 Savage, Kalief Browder and Trayvon Martin demonstrates concern and commitment to telling the stories of black men that the system traps and kills. But the same forces that create and maintain billionaires rely on what Jay-Z is seemingly critical of: racism, poverty, <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8096643/jay-z-president-trump-vulgar-immigration-comments-hurtful-van-jones-show-cnn\">xenophobia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/24/entertainment/jay-z-meek-mill-prison/index.html\">incarceration</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/overwhelmed-beyonc-jay-z-preach-lgbtq-acceptance-glaad-awards-speech-n988871\">homophobia</a>.</p> <p>We have police violence partly <em>because</em> we have billionaires; the former serves the latter. America is the most <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/12/us-states-with-the-highest-levels-of-income-inequality.html\">unequal</a> nation in the world. Politicians employ police to <a href=\"http://inthesetimes.com/working/entry/17505/police_and_poor_people\">punish</a> the poor, protect the rich, and preserve property for a select few. So when Jay-Z <a href=\"https://genius.com/Jay-z-family-feud-lyrics\">asks</a>, \u201cWhat\u2019s better than one billionaire\u201d, the answer is not two of the \u201csame hue\u201d. It is a world free of the inequality and institutionalized racism that created the projects that he had to escape.</p> <p>As one of the most influential voices in the world today, Jay-Z has a real chance to make change. He might consider looking to Colin Kaepernick, Michael Bennett, and Muhammad Ali for guidance, or even to the liberation movements that existed long before Kaepernick\u2019s knee ever touched the turf. Jay-Z <a href=\"https://genius.com/Jay-z-and-kanye-west-murder-to-excellence-lyrics\">rapped</a> that he \u201carrived on the day Fred Hampton died\u201d. Hampton, a Black Panther party leader killed by the police, <a href=\"https://www.historyisaweapon.com/defcon1/fhamptonspeech.html\">insisted</a>: \u201cWe say you don\u2019t fight capitalism with no black capitalism; you fight capitalism with socialism.\u201d Perhaps we all could start learning there.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 20 August 2019 to describe the death of Michael Brown as a killing.</p>",

So when Jay-Z asks, \u201cWhat\u2019s better than one billionaire\u201d, the answer is not two of the \u201csame hue\u201d. It is a world free of the inequality and institutionalized racism that created the projects that he had to escape. As one of the most influential voices in the world today, Jay-Z has a real chance to make change. He might consider looking to Colin Kaepernick, Michael Bennett, and Muhammad Ali for guidance, or even to the liberation movements that existed long before Kaepernick\u2019s knee ever touched the turf. Jay-Z rapped that he \u201carrived on the day Fred Hampton died\u201d. Hampton, a Black Panther party leader killed by the police, insisted: \u201cWe say you don\u2019t fight capitalism with no black capitalism; you fight capitalism with socialism.\u201d Perhaps we all could start learning there. \u2022 This article was amended on 20 August 2019 to describe the death of Michael Brown as a killing.",

      "body": "<p>A sheriff has criticised Scotland\u2019s weak wildlife crime laws after a gamekeeper convicted of killing protected birds of prey and mammals avoided a prison term.</p> <p>Alan Wilson, 60, pleaded guilty in July to shooting and trapping badgers, an otter, goshawks and buzzards and installing 23 illegal snares in a small wood on a grouse- and pheasant-shooting estate at Longformacus near Duns.</p> <p>Wilson, then a member of the Scottish Gamekeepers Association, also admitted using snares illegally and possessing two bottles of carbofuran, a banned carbamate nerve agent used to poison birds of prey.</p> <p>Sheriff Peter Paterson, sitting at Jedburgh sheriff court, said such crimes usually deserved a prison sentence.

      "bodyText": "A sheriff has criticised Scotland\u2019s weak wildlife crime laws after a gamekeeper convicted of killing protected birds of prey and mammals avoided a prison term. Alan Wilson, 60, pleaded guilty in July to shooting and trapping badgers, an otter, goshawks and buzzards and installing 23 illegal snares in a small wood on a grouse- and pheasant-shooting estate at Longformacus near Duns. Wilson, then a member of the Scottish Gamekeepers Association, also admitted using snares illegally and possessing two bottles of carbofuran, a banned carbamate nerve agent used to poison birds of prey. Sheriff Peter Paterson, sitting at Jedburgh sheriff court, said such crimes usually deserved a prison sentence. However, the Wildlife and Countryside Act allowed sentences of up to six months, and Scottish ministers had recently introduced a presumption against jailing offenders for less than 12 months. \u201cIt highlights the difficulties with the legislation,\u201d Paterson said. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for this provision [on short-term sentences] then in my view a custodial sentence would have been appropriate.\u201d He ordered Wilson to carry out 225 hours of unpaid work, imposed a night-time curfew for 10 months and confiscated Wilson\u2019s firearms and gamekeeper equipment. Wilson\u2019s solicitor, Colin Severin, had told the court that Wilson\u2019s wife, who is 80, had dementia and required round-the-clock care. Last year, Wilson was fined \u00a3400 and banned from keeping birds of prey for 10 years after admitting he had failed to protect a captive eagle owl in his care from suffering. Wildlife experts believe the owl, which was kept in filthy conditions in a pigsty, was used to lure other birds of prey to be killed. Mark Rafferty, the head of investigations with the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SSPCA), and Robbie Marsland, the director of the League Against Cruel Sports (LACS), said the sheriff\u2019s ruling underlined the need for ministers to increase penalties for wildlife crime. The Scottish government has signalled it wants to increase the maximum prison sentence in wildlife crime cases to five years, with unlimited fines. Marsland said: \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen today is the total confusion about Scottish law on wildlife crime. The act needs to be strengthened.\u201d Rafferty said: \u201cI\u2019m sure if stronger penalties had been available to the sheriff, we would have seen a different outcome today.\u201d Police Scotland raided Wilson\u2019s estate with the help of the SSPCA and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds in June 2017 after LACS investigators found a \u201cstink pit\u201d, where animal carcasses were dumped to attract birds of prey and other carnivores. The pit was surrounded by snares, and a dead badger and goshawk were found nearby. Police found snare tags, birds of prey decoys, gin traps and an electronic device that broadcast bird calls. They also found the captive owl, and that case went to trial earlier because it was an animal welfare case. Gamekeepers will target mammals on game estates because they can eat game bird eggs and young, or allow ticks to circulate. Wildlife crime investigators and conservation experts said they were astonished at the scale of Wilson\u2019s crimes. David Anderson, a wildlife conservation expert who helped the police search, said in a report for the prosecution: \u201cIn 40 years working in wildlife management, I have never seen so many protected species dead in such a small area.\u201d Vermin lists were found in Wilson\u2019s cottage raid, noting all the birds and mammals it is believed he had killed on the estate and during a previous gamekeeper job in France. One list, with the name Longformacus on it, recorded the deaths of 42 foxes, 32 cats, 75 rats, 103 stoats, 37 weasels, 90 hedgehogs, five mink, 622 rooks and 81 jackdaws.",

      "bodyText": "Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s preference for holding another referendum on Scottish independence in the second half of next year has been put in doubt after the Electoral Commission recommended a gap of at least nine months between the completion of the required legislation and polling day. Legislation to enable a second referendum was introduced by Sturgeon, the first minister, to the Scottish parliament in May. This could be completed by the end of 2019, but supporting legislation would then have to be passed to specify the details of the poll. In a submission to the Scottish parliament\u2019s finance and constitution committee, published last week, the Electoral Commission insisted it should be given 12 weeks to assess the wording of the question to be put in the referendum. Referendum wording has been the subject of some controversy, since the draft bill states the commission will not be consulted if it has previously assessed or recommended a question, as was the case with the yes/no format used for the 2014 referendum. Critics argued the yes/no format favoured the affirmative side, and the commission subsequently recommended the options of leave and remain for the 2016 EU referendum. While the commission said it had not ruled out a future yes/no question on independence, it believes the assessment should be based on current evidence and political context. \u201cThe Electoral Commission must be required to assess any referendum question proposed in legislation and set the commission\u2019s views before the Scottish parliament, regardless of whether the commission has previously published views on the question proposed,\u201d it wrote in the submission. In terms of timetabling, the submission leaves the Scottish government with little room for manoeuvre. The submission recommends taking 12 weeks to assess the question, including eight to carry out public opinion research and a further six for designating lead campaigners. It acknowledges this could overlap with the six-month period it recommends between legislation being passed and the start of a campaign. The submission explains this six-month period \u201cis so that campaigners and counting officers have sufficient time to understand, take advice on, receive guidance and generally prepare to comply with the rules once they are in force. \u201cMost importantly, it is this lead-in period that also enables voters to be informed about the issues at stake in the referendum and have confidence in the process leading to a free and fair referendum, with a result that has overall legitimacy for the public,\u201d it added. The submission recommends a minimum 10-week campaign period that, added to the 26-week lead-in period, amounts to 36 weeks or roughly nine months. The parliamentary timing before this recommended lead-in period is also tight. The finance and constitution committee will take oral evidence on the bill during September and October and then publish its first-stage report. Sturgeon has said she may consider accelerating the passage of the bill but, even if it is passed by Christmas, secondary legislation will be required to specify the referendum date, length of campaign period and the question itself. The first minister has previously committed to securing the necessary transfer of powers from Westminster before holding a vote, and warned Boris Johnson this month against blocking a fresh referendum after a poll found a majority would now vote yes. A Scottish government spokesperson said: \u201cThe referendums (Scotland) bill is scheduled to complete its parliamentary progress by the end of this calendar year, but it is always open to seek parliament\u2019s agreement to an accelerated timetable. And while the timing of a referendum will be for parliament to determine, we will carefully consider all suggestions from the Electoral Commission.\u201d",

Let\u2019s begin with a tribute to Ronald Blythe\u2019s Akenfield by PatLux: I just spoke to my 88 year-old mother who is reading Akenfield, which is reminding her of her own rural childhood and the stories told to her by her parents. I had discovered it in a charity shop in Edinburgh and brought it back to Luxembourg to read and enjoy.

I wonder where it will go next and I trust that it will give as much joy to the next reader as it has done to three of us. Many thanks to whoever it was on Tips, Links and Suggestions who inspired me to add this title to the list which I take with me to charity shops. MereMortal has \u201cfinally got round to starting\u201d Howard Zinn\u2019s \u201clegendary\u201d The People\u2019s History of the United States: I\u2019ve known about it for a decade or more and have owned it for about three years. He\u2019s the most marvellous and sympathetic writer and he brings out of obscurity a wealth of highly character-driven stories of African slaves, American Indians, indentured white European servants, and women. People he considers were always omitted by the founding fathers when they declaimed \u201cwe the people\u201d. I\u2019m loving it. Zinn was that rare thing, an American socialist and a superb academic and this book was a massive hit as a history book and has been widely translated around the world. LLCoolJ is in need of lighter reading after finishing one of this year\u2019s Booker nominations, Lost Children Archive by Valeria Luiselli: Here we have a \u201cNo names, please\u201d family of four \u2013 Ma, Pa, boy, girl \u2013 driving from NYC to Arizona. The parents are documentarians/documentarists (definitions and distinctions provided) who worked together on a sound-recording project that among other things recorded the over 800 languages spoken in NYC (I had no idea there are that many). Ma is now focused on a project about the \u201clost children\u201d and detained migrants from Central America, and Pa is working on a project related to the Apaches.

I expect it will haunt me for a long time, and I feel the need for something frothy next. So \u2026 Nina Stibbe, here I come. GELBuck has \u201cjust finished\u201d The Frayed Atlantic Edge by David Gange: His series of kayak journeys down the Atlantic coasts of Scotland, Ireland and bits of Wales and England is the thread linking history, culture, geography and nature. A different perspective on our history and a book that makes me want to retire immediately and spend my time reading and kayaking on a west coast somewhere! Ubik by Phillip K Dick has been keeping Bacon78 guessing: The question of what is reality is explored here with a fun plot that keeps you guessing, and the philosophy never gets in the way of a good story. How do I know what I am experiencing is reality? How do I know that I\u2019m not a simulation in an advanced computer, or that my reality is a product of my own imagination, and I\u2019m actually in a coma somewhere on life support? Well, I don\u2019t and neither do the characters in Ubik!! Richard Flanagan\u2019s The Sound of One Hand Clapping has moved paulburns: A heart-wrenching story of a father-daughter relationship, set against the background of WW@ refugees living and working in Tasmania from 1954 to 1990. There are so many twists and turns in the story, most of them unexpected, that it would be unfair to other readers to give too many details. Suffice to say Flanagan writes with lyricism and passion of his beloved island, with his usual deep and sensitive understanding of the human condition. Finally, a eulogy in honour of Sebastian Barry from JayZed: Crikey, Sebastian Barry\u2018s a splendid writer, isn\u2019t he? I was blown away a few weeks ago by Days Without End, and I\u2019ve now been moved by The Secret Scripture. If I didn\u2019t rate it quite as highly as Days Without End, that\u2019s mostly because I loved DWE so much. A lot of similarities between the two books, despite the contrasting plots. In both Barry is masterful in creating compelling and distinctive narrative voices; and both books are ultimately stories which celebrate love and humanity within a context of brutal cruelty. He can certainly write them. Interesting links about books and reading An anthology of literary quotes illustrating every year of life from conception to death. (Now also an exhibition.) Where libraries are also tourist attractions. (Calgary Central Library has a train running through it!) Barack Obama\u2019s summer reading list. Ian Buruma revisits the writing of Anne Frank. Enjoyably rude medieval Welsh poems. Seek and destroy! Metallica are releasing a kids\u2019 book. If you\u2019re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #GuardianBooks, and we\u2019ll include a selection in this blog. Happy reading!",

But what exactly is it that makes one of the world\u2019s most desolate places such an attractive proposition? For the president, it is the real estate deal of a lifetime, one that would secure a land mass a quarter the size of the US and cement his place in US history alongside President Andrew Johnson, who bought Alaska from Russia in 1867, and Thomas Jefferson, who secured Louisiana from the French in 1803. To Trump\u2019s advisers, the planned multibillion-dollar takeover challenges China\u2019s dominance of the world\u2019s industrial metals and helps to block Russia\u2019s renewed military ambitions. Not that Washington has put a value on Greenland ahead of Trump\u2019s meeting next month with Kim Kielsen, the province\u2019s leader, and the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen. These are early days in the discussion, Trump said. Greenland is an autonomous region that effectively runs itself while Denmark, its sovereign owner, takes care of defence and foreign policy. The three leaders were due to discuss Copenhagen\u2019s Nato contributions, which Washington has long believed could be higher, and could be more in kind \u2013 such as extra airbases \u2013 than in cash, given Greenland\u2019s strategic position between the US and Russia. But Trump\u2019s advisers have spent much of their time in the West Wing downgrading concerns about Vladimir Putin and his military ambitions in favour of plotting how to win an economic war with China. This is why an age-old conversation with Denmark about leases for parcels of Greenland has developed into one about buying the whole place outright. Greenland harbours some of the largest deposits of rare-earth metals, including neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium and terbium, along with uranium and the byproducts of zinc. US corporations once thought of China as a benign supplier of rare-earth metals for mobile phones, computers and more recently electric cars. And the US government was relaxed when Chinese companies began hoovering up mines across central and southern Africa to secure an even greater dominance of the global market. The arrival of Xi Jinping as China\u2019s leader, and his more aggressive foreign policy stance, has spooked many US policymakers. Among Trump\u2019s advisers, the need for greater economic independence has raced up the agenda. A target for the US is Greenland Minerals, an Australian company that has generated a good deal of excitement since it started operating on Greenland\u2019s south-west peninsula in 2007 to develop the Kvanefjeld mine, which is home to many rare-earth metals. More than 100m tonnes of ore are believed to be sitting below the surface and the project is expected to become one of the largest global producers outside China. Trump made it clear on the tarmac as he prepared to board Air Force One, bound for the G7 summit in France, that he thought Greenland had a price, in the same way that everything and everybody has a price, and Denmark could be a willing seller. He said: \u201cWe protect Denmark like we do large portions of the world. So the concept came up and I said, certainly. Strategically it\u2019s interesting. It\u2019s essentially a large real estate deal.\u201d The art of the deal is to spot your adversary\u2019s weakness.

An uncanny silence hangs in the air, punctuated only by the sound of water cannons patrolling the street and a sea of riot police conversing in hushed tones with each other. The blue-helmeted police, a signature of the Robert Mugabe era, march in straight lines through the central business district. Businesses are closed. Thick clouds of off-white teargas fill the sky. An old, grey-haired man who is left behind by the fleeing crowd is kicked in the ribs by two police officers and dragged by his side. A young man who tries to assist the stricken woman is arrested and bundled into a police truck. Elsewhere, Red Cross volunteers attend to an old woman who has suffered injuries to her head after being beaten.</p> <p>The protesters had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/15/armed-police-patrol-zimbabwes-capital-ready-to-stifle-protests\" title=\"\">gathered on Friday</a> to express their anger at Mnangagwa\u2019s rule. People are increasingly dissatisfied with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/10/zimbabwe-emmerson-mnangagwa-battle-to-survive\" title=\"\">impact of failing economic policies</a>, a broken public health system, the soaring prices of basic goods and the collapse of public services. They had been waiting in preparation for a protest march organised by the Movement for Democratic Change at Africa Unity Square, a garden in the heart of Harare. In this same garden, just a few years ago, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-44209183\" title=\"\">Itai Dzamara</a> stood as a lone protester calling for Mugabe to go.</p> <p>The protesters could not access the square because the police had cordoned it off. Instead, they congregated on a main road adjacent to the square, patiently awaiting the outcome of a court challenge mounted early that morning. The court challenge sought to overturn a police ban that had been instated using the notoriously repressive <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Order_and_Security_Act_(Zimbabwe)\" title=\"\">Public Order and Security Act</a> at the 11th hour, the night before the planned demonstration.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b0fba225ca1a52d5ed975ed4fd9493fb6c2ea251\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0fba225ca1a52d5ed975ed4fd9493fb6c2ea251/0_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Emmerson Mnangagwa\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Emmerson Mnangagwa\u2019s promise of change and reform, much lauded by the UK and Europe at the time of Mugabe\u2019s ousting, has proven to be a mirage.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jekesai Njikizana/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Protesters chanted songs similar to those sung during the liberation struggle. They sat in the middle of the road, in an act of peaceful protest. As they sat, a wave of baton-wielding riot police charged at them in an attempt to disperse the growing crowd. Many, including older people and women, who could not run away as fast as the more youthful protesters, were badly beaten.</p> <p>The violent police clampdown is just the latest action in a tale of unbroken state repression that continues from Mugabe\u2019s era. In the aftermath of the July 2018 election, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/02/zimbabwe-tense-calm-in-harare-after-post-election-violence\" title=\"\">military killed at least six civilians</a> as it drove army tankers through the streets of Harare to quell a protest. Similarly, in January this year, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/14/zimbabwe-police-clash-protesters-first-day-general-strike\" title=\"\">army fired live rounds</a> at civilians in the wake of a protest against the rising cost of living. At least <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-46955725\" title=\"\">12 civilians lost their lives</a>. The perpetrators have yet to be indicted or held accountable for the loss of life, despite a theatrical commission of inquiry launched by Mnangagwa in a bid to repair his already crumbling international image.</p> <p>In addition to thwarting the freedom to protest, the repression by Mnangagwa\u2019s government has been characterised by the partisan use of security services, tampering with <a href=\"https://www.trtworld.com/magazine/is-zimbabwe-s-new-leader-stifling-judicial-freedom-27854\" title=\"\">judicial independence</a>, the surveillance and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/08/zimbabwe-activists-go-into-hiding-security-crackdown-intensifies\" title=\"\">intimidation of activists</a>, sham trials of human-rights defenders, impunity for human-rights-violating security forces \u2013 and targeted <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2019/08/zimbabwe-violent-crackdown-on-activists-underway-ahead-of-opposition-protests/\" title=\"\">beatings and abductions of human-rights activists</a> and members of the opposition.</p> <p>Mnangagwa\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2017/nov/24/emmerson-mnangagwa-promises-democratic-elections-for-zimbabwe-video\" title=\"\">promise of change and reform</a>, much lauded by the UK and Europe at the time of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/21/cheers-relief-and-joy-zimbabweans-react-to-the-fall-of-robert-mugabe\" title=\"\">Mugabe\u2019s ousting</a>, has proven to be a mirage. It was argued by the UK and some in Europe that Zimbabwe needed a \u201cstrong man\u201d, a Paul Kagame-type figure, to drive economic reforms. However, on this front too, Mnangagwa has failed amid several negative economic indicators: official statistics claim that annual inflation <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-01/once-famed-for-hyperinflation-zimbabwe-suspends-inflation-data\" title=\"\">surged to 175.7% in June</a>, although economists project that the real inflation rate is much higher than this.

      "bodyText": "In the Shona language, Nyamavhuvhu (August) signals the end of winter. The strong winds carry away the frost as they usher in the warmth of summer. With the silent strength of a new season, public discontent towards President Emmerson Mnangagwa\u2019s failing socio-economic policies sweeps across Zimbabwe, manifesting itself through mounting displeasure and the growing threat of civil unrest. On the streets of the capital, Harare, a middle-aged woman lies unconscious on the asphalt. An uncanny silence hangs in the air, punctuated only by the sound of water cannons patrolling the street and a sea of riot police conversing in hushed tones with each other. The blue-helmeted police, a signature of the Robert Mugabe era, march in straight lines through the central business district. Businesses are closed. Thick clouds of off-white teargas fill the sky. An old, grey-haired man who is left behind by the fleeing crowd is kicked in the ribs by two police officers and dragged by his side. A young man who tries to assist the stricken woman is arrested and bundled into a police truck. Elsewhere, Red Cross volunteers attend to an old woman who has suffered injuries to her head after being beaten. The protesters had gathered on Friday to express their anger at Mnangagwa\u2019s rule. People are increasingly dissatisfied with the impact of failing economic policies, a broken public health system, the soaring prices of basic goods and the collapse of public services. They had been waiting in preparation for a protest march organised by the Movement for Democratic Change at Africa Unity Square, a garden in the heart of Harare. In this same garden, just a few years ago, Itai Dzamara stood as a lone protester calling for Mugabe to go. The protesters could not access the square because the police had cordoned it off. Instead, they congregated on a main road adjacent to the square, patiently awaiting the outcome of a court challenge mounted early that morning. The court challenge sought to overturn a police ban that had been instated using the notoriously repressive Public Order and Security Act at the 11th hour, the night before the planned demonstration. Protesters chanted songs similar to those sung during the liberation struggle. They sat in the middle of the road, in an act of peaceful protest. As they sat, a wave of baton-wielding riot police charged at them in an attempt to disperse the growing crowd. Many, including older people and women, who could not run away as fast as the more youthful protesters, were badly beaten. The violent police clampdown is just the latest action in a tale of unbroken state repression that continues from Mugabe\u2019s era. In the aftermath of the July 2018 election, the military killed at least six civilians as it drove army tankers through the streets of Harare to quell a protest. Similarly, in January this year, the army fired live rounds at civilians in the wake of a protest against the rising cost of living. At least 12 civilians lost their lives. The perpetrators have yet to be indicted or held accountable for the loss of life, despite a theatrical commission of inquiry launched by Mnangagwa in a bid to repair his already crumbling international image. In addition to thwarting the freedom to protest, the repression by Mnangagwa\u2019s government has been characterised by the partisan use of security services, tampering with judicial independence, the surveillance and intimidation of activists, sham trials of human-rights defenders, impunity for human-rights-violating security forces \u2013 and targeted beatings and abductions of human-rights activists and members of the opposition. Mnangagwa\u2019s promise of change and reform, much lauded by the UK and Europe at the time of Mugabe\u2019s ousting, has proven to be a mirage. It was argued by the UK and some in Europe that Zimbabwe needed a \u201cstrong man\u201d, a Paul Kagame-type figure, to drive economic reforms. However, on this front too, Mnangagwa has failed amid several negative economic indicators: official statistics claim that annual inflation surged to 175.7% in June, although economists project that the real inflation rate is much higher than this. The government has since suspended the official publication of inflation statistics. There have been shortages of food and fuel. There has also been a return to acute, daily power cuts, which often last for 18 hours, with power returning in the dead of night. The government\u2019s mantra that \u201cZimbabwe is open for business\u201d has proven to be a hollow epithet, as foreign direct investment remains extremely low and local businesses continue to close shop in the face of a confidence deficit. Corruption remains rampant with little commitment to deal with the perpetrators and recover the looted funds. Mnangagwa has failed at the most basic political reform. The mask has fallen away leaving in its stead a man more brutal and devoid of character than his predecessor. In the wake of his stewardship lies a country where individuals cannot afford a decent life and are punished for trying to register their growing discontent. It is time for the UK and Europe, who backed Mnangagwa, to stand with democratic forces and innocent, brutalised citizens \u2013 not a corrupt authoritarian regime incapable of reforming politically and economically. Only then can the winds of real change sweep across Zimbabwe. \u2022 Fadzayi Mahere is a Zimbabwean lawyer and politician",

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn has left the door open to staying neutral in a second referendum if the choice were between a Labour Brexit deal and staying in the EU, after his shadow chancellor, John McDonnell suggested he would campaign to remain in any circumstances. The Labour leader was clear that the party would campaign to remain against a no-deal Brexit, as he pledged to do everything possible to prevent crashing out on 31 October. But when asked if the party would stay neutral given a choice between a deal negotiated by Labour and remaining in the EU, Corbyn did not say which side the party would support. \u201cIn a general election, we will put forward the opportunity for people in this country to have the final say,\u201d he said on Monday. \u201cIt is not a rerun of 2016. It is simply saying the people of this country should make the final decision. \u201cIf it is no deal versus remain then obviously John McDonnell and others made it very clear we would support remain. If there is the opportunity for some other option to be put then that will be put. I want to bring people together.\u201d He continued: \u201cAll I have been trying to do ever since the referendum is say there has to be an understanding of why communities around the country voted to leave because they see no investment, jobs or improvement in their livelihoods for a very long time and they are very, very angry. What we are offering is to transform our society and our economy.\u201d Asked whether he would personally campaign to remain in those circumstances, he said: \u201cWe have been very clear that in accordance with the democratic decision taken by our conference last year, an incoming Labour government will facilitate a choice where everyone will have a choice between a deal or remaining in the European Union.\u201d The precedents for neutrality would be the 1975 referendum, when the then Labour prime minister, Harold Wilson, allowed his cabinet to campaign on either side for and against membership of the European Community, while David Cameron also made the same decision for the Conservative party to stay neutral in the 2016 referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the EU. Earlier, McDonnell appeared to take a different line when he made clear he would campaign to remain in the EU whatever the other option put forward in a second referendum. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI think generally people want to provide the electorate with a choice. I\u2019ve made it clear from my personal position that I\u2019ll be campaigning for remain. I think that\u2019s the best choice. \u201cBut people will want to have a say and see whether there is another option. But we\u2019ve had that debate in parliament and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve come down in favour of remain because I can\u2019t see one that will have the same benefits as remain.\u201d He was asked if he would be happy for the party as a whole to be \u201cagnostic\u201d on the issue, despite his personal wish to campaign to remain in the EU. McDonnell replied: \u201cThat\u2019s one of the issues we\u2019ve got to debate in the party. You know our democratic processes. I know people get frustrated with this \u2026 but we\u2019re a democratic party.\u201d The party\u2019s policy could change at this year\u2019s conference, where there will be a strong effort from pro-EU groups to shift Labour towards being an official remain party in all circumstances. Corbyn set out his position in a speech in the key marginal Tory-held seat of Corby in the east Midlands, where he made the case that the UK\u2019s problems run much deeper than Brexit. \u201cA general election triggered by the Tory Brexit crisis will be a crossroads for our country. It will be a once-in-a-generation chance for a real change of direction, potentially on the scale of 1945. Things cannot go on as they were before,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever the Brexit crisis is resolved, the country faces a fundamental choice. Labour offers the real change of direction the country needs: a radical programme to rebuild and transform communities and public services, invest in the green jobs and high-tech industries of the future, and take action to tackle inequality and climate crisis.\u201d The Labour leader accused Boris Johnson of being a \u201cfake populist and phoney outsider\u201d in the mould of Donald Trump as he set out his election pitch to transform the country as radically as Labour did in 1945 with the creation of the welfare state. He also said Labour would do everything possible to stop a no-deal Brexit and called on opposition MPs and rebel Tories to \u201cget on board\u201d with his plan to hold a no-confidence vote, then form a caretaker government to extend article 50 and hold a general election. Asked whether he could support another caretaker leader if he could not gain cross-party support, he said it was a role for the opposition leader to take on. Following the leak of documents warning of protests and food shortages in the event of a no-deal Brexit, he attacked Johnson for the Conservative party\u2019s \u201cfailure on Brexit, and its lurch to the hard right, which has provoked the crisis our country faces this autumn\u201d. \u201cBoris Johnson\u2019s government wants to use no deal to create a tax haven for the super-rich on the shores of Europe and sign a sweetheart trade deal with Donald Trump: not so much a no-deal Brexit as a Trump-deal Brexit,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "A trade union has launched a petition to support migrant kitchen porters who say they were suspended after campaigning for the London living wage at a private members\u2019 club owned by a backer of Boris Johnson. Protests have taken place outside the Mayfair club known as 5 Hertford Street, owned by the millionaire Brexiter Robin Birley, after the suspension of workers who were recently outsourced to ACT Clean, a cleaning company. Kitchen porters at the club were said to have been paid \u00a38.65 per hour before the launch of a campaign by the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB), and pay was increased to \u00a39 per hour after pressure. However, one worker was suspended at the end of July and seven others were suspended later, according to the union, which has recently begun to represent people in sectors that have traditionally not had trade union representation. The union launched a petition accusing the cleaning company of victimising workers and suspending them on trumped-up charges while denying them occupational sick pay. Addressed to Birley and John Stevenson, the chief executive of ACT Clean, the petition calls for the workers to be guaranteed the London living wage of \u00a310.55 per hour and for an end to the outsourcing of kitchen porters. Birley, a property developer and long-time Brexit supporter who previously donated to Ukip under Nigel Farage, donated at least \u00a320,000 to Johnson before his victory in the Tory leadership race.

      "bodyText": "Nicholas Ioannou\u2019s name gives away his nationality but the moment he opens his mouth, allowing his natural Manchester twang to escape, a whole new identity is created. Born to a Cypriot father and English mother in Limassol, the 23-year-old defender\u2019s journey to the verge of the Champions League has been an unusual one. Raised in Cyprus until the age of 12, Ioannou was spotted at a football camp in Nicosia by Manchester United scouts, who brought him to England to continue his education alongside Marcus Rashford and Scott McTominay. The schooling he received played a big part in Ioannou becoming a key player at Apoel Nicosia, helping them win five consecutive domestic titles. \u201cIt was a massive move and it wasn\u2019t expected but I was very happy and grateful for the opportunity,\u201d he says. \u201cI was young and looking forward to it and really wanted to live there to go to the Manchester United academy.\u201d Things progressed well for Ioannou at United. He captained the reserves and was optimistic of making the grade at Old Trafford until fate and David Moyes intervened during the manager\u2019s one and only summer in charge. Ioannou was left searching for a another club at 18 after a hip injury ruled him out for four months and contributed to him not being offered a professional deal. \u201cThe injury just took me down when I was at a young age and I\u2019d been doing so well. I didn\u2019t manage to get back to the way I was, so it had a big effect on my career. I felt I deserved a second chance to prove myself but that didn\u2019t happen. I enjoyed every moment at United and it was a big part of my life. I wanted to carry on there but this is how it goes and that\u2019s what they decided. I had to take it on the chin and move on.\u201d A chance to stay in England came when Stoke offered a two-year contract but Ioannou felt he would be better served returning to his homeland. A haul of medals since signing for Apoel, in addition to full international honours, have more than justified Ioannou rejecting the comfort of the Premier League. Within months of signing for Apoel he was playing in the Champions League aged 18 and was part of the team narrowly defeated by Paris Saint-Germain.

They play great football as they showed last season but they\u2019ve lost a few players who were a big part of the team. You just have to enjoy it and see what happens, because you never know in this game.\u201d The loss of Frenkie de Jong to Barcelona and Matthijs de Ligt to Juventus will have an impact on Ajax but despite their ability to evolve each season this could be the perfect time to catch the Dutch side, who struggled to get past Greece\u2019s Paok in the previous qualifying round. \u201cApoel fans are great, they boost you up really fast.

It has also put the campaign experts and analysts who cooperated with him over his book into the line of fire.</p> <p>It comes two years after Halperin\u2019s dramatic fall, when he was accused by <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2017/10/27/media/mark-halperin-new-accusations/index.html\">at least a dozen women</a> at ABC News of he sexually harassing them in the early 2000s, when he was the network\u2019s political director.</p> <p>The accusations, for which he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/27/mark-halperin-sexual-harassment-allegations-apology\">apologized</a>, led to him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/26/mark-halperin-sexual-harassment-suspended-msnbc\">losing prominent TV roles</a> and also led to HBO cancelling plans for a serialization of a follow-up to his bestselling book on the 2008 presidential election, Game Change, based on 2016.</p> <p>In recent months Halperin has been nudging himself back into the world of political punditry, launching a current affairs email service, <a href=\"https://wwofnews.com/\">Wide World of News</a>, and putting himself forward for interviews on Sirius XM.</p> <p>But releasing a new book on a subject as central as how to defeat Trump is a comeback effort on a different level \u2013 an audacious move that has not been emulated by other high-profile media men whose careers collapsed in the wake of #MeToo, such as Matt Lauer, Charlie Rose or Bill O\u2019Reilly.</p> <p>The news was greeted with indignation by some of Halperin\u2019s accusers.

      "bodyText": "Mark Halperin, one of the most high-profile media figures to fall over sexual misconduct allegations made in the #MeToo era, is making an attempted comeback with a new book deal expected to be announced on Monday. The revelation of Halperin\u2019s new book, How to Beat Trump: America\u2019s Top Political Strategists on What It Will Take, first reported by Politico, has put the pundit back under the spotlight and reignited the anger of critics including some of his original female detractors. It has also put the campaign experts and analysts who cooperated with him over his book into the line of fire. It comes two years after Halperin\u2019s dramatic fall, when he was accused by at least a dozen women at ABC News of he sexually harassing them in the early 2000s, when he was the network\u2019s political director. The accusations, for which he apologized, led to him losing prominent TV roles and also led to HBO cancelling plans for a serialization of a follow-up to his bestselling book on the 2008 presidential election, Game Change, based on 2016. In recent months Halperin has been nudging himself back into the world of political punditry, launching a current affairs email service, Wide World of News, and putting himself forward for interviews on Sirius XM. But releasing a new book on a subject as central as how to defeat Trump is a comeback effort on a different level \u2013 an audacious move that has not been emulated by other high-profile media men whose careers collapsed in the wake of #MeToo, such as Matt Lauer, Charlie Rose or Bill O\u2019Reilly. The news was greeted with indignation by some of Halperin\u2019s accusers. Emily Miller, who accused him of harassing her at ABC News, lamented on Twitter: \u201cI wish someone had told us \u2013 the victims \u2013 this was happening so we could at least prepare emotionally.\u201d Dianna Goldberg May, who charged the then ABC News political director with forcing her to sit on his lap in 1994 during a meeting when she was a researcher on the network, told the Washington Post: \u201cUntil Mark demonstrates any understanding of how destructive his behaviours were to so many, he doesn\u2019t deserve another platform.\u201d She also had harsh words for the many top Democrats who spoke to Halperin for his new book. According to Politico the list runs to 75 senior figures and includes stellar consultants such as David Axelrod, Donna Brazile, James Carville and Anita Dunn. Axelrod, chief strategist for both Barack Obama\u2019s presidential victories, was contrite. He said he had answered a few of Halperin\u2019s questions about the 2020 race by email, adding: \u201cI regret responding at all.\u201d Brazile, Al Gore\u2019s campaign manager in 2000, was more forthright. She told CNN\u2019s Oliver Darcy: \u201cI\u2019m not the author. Ask Mark why he chose us.\u201d It may not be coincidental that Halperin\u2019s publisher is no stranger to controversy herself. Judith Regan was the mastermind behind If I Did It \u2013 the ill-fated idea of getting OJ Simpson to hypothetically act out the murder of his ex-wife Nicole Brown and her friend Ron Goldman. In a statement to Politico, Regan sought to justify her decision to go with Halperin\u2019s book as an act of moral courage. \u201cI do not in any way, shape or form condone any harm done by one human being to another.

The breakdown of a long-term relationship released a complex tangle of emotions and caused Myall to question everything about himself. \u201cIt just sent me into a spiral.

My mum put me in my place\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His early rugby life, he believes, was a contributory factor. As a promising youngster he was picked up by the Leeds academy, overseen by Stuart Lancaster, later to become the England coach. Myall has only good things to say about Lancaster \u2013 \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for him I probably wouldn\u2019t have been a professional rugby player\u201d \u2013 but his first taste of representative rugby was particularly grim. \u201cWhen I was 17 we\u2019d get sent down to England\u2019s under-18 national academy camps in Bath. The training was horrific. They got it completely wrong. I did it for a year and was thinking: \u2018I don\u2019t want to play rugby any more.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>When he returned to Leeds, Lancaster used him as a case study for his level five coaching qualification. One of the coach\u2019s aims was to see if he could help a fine athlete become more confident and assertive; Myall, though, was increasingly aware of being perceived by some as mentally weak based on the harsh \u2013 and, in his view, unfair \u2013 feedback from his painful national academy stint. \u201cIt was simply because I didn\u2019t want to be there. I was just getting through training because I had to.\u201d Others may now wonder if it is entirely a coincidence that several of his age-group contemporaries \u2013 Danny Cipriani, Danny Care, Ryan Lamb, Rob Webber \u2013 have also had their subsequent off-field problems.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8c9683aa2101b677f2e8fa375a3f9bd10e53078e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c9683aa2101b677f2e8fa375a3f9bd10e53078e/0_85_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kearnan Myall\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kearnan Myall signs autographs in 2014 but the remorseless rugby treadmill led to depression and a failed drugs test for cocaine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Myall was fine until \u201cout of nowhere\u201d his crippling depression struck. His off-field behaviour soon began to deteriorate. \u201cThere was a period of two to three months where I\u2019d made peace with the fact that, at some point, I was going to commit suicide. I was drinking a lot, I was spending thousands of pounds on nights out. One Saturday night, in the middle of the season, I went out and took a load of cocaine. If you\u2019re caught in competition you get banned for four years. I was 27, so it would have been the end of my career.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/16/wales-james-davies-england-rugby-world-cup\">Wales\u2019s James Davies: \u2018I take opportunities and change opinions\u2019 | Paul Rees</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Less than 48 hours later, fate decreed he was chosen to undergo a random drug test. He returned a positive sample. Under the Rugby Football Union\u2019s drugs policy, first-time offenders remain anonymous, cop a fine and are sent for medical help. \u201cIt was probably the best and most lucky thing that could have happened to me. It\u2019s basically a test to clean up people like me, who either have a drugs problem or are in trouble. You get fined \u00a35,000 and sent to see a psychiatrist in central London. I sat down and explained how I was feeling. Very calmly he explained I was clinically depressed. I remember sitting there thinking: \u2018I\u2019m not clinically depressed. Do you not know I\u2019m an athlete?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Throughout this troubled period, remarkably, his form was excellent. \u201cI was playing some of the best rugby I\u2019d ever played. I didn\u2019t care. I was going out and just throwing my body around. It was completely unsustainable. One weekend we played Harlequins at the Ricoh. The night before I remember being on my hands and knees on my hotel room floor just crying and crying. I still felt terrible the following morning, then went out and played probably my best game of the season.\u201d</p> <p>Confiding in other people felt impossible. \u201cYou don\u2019t want other people to know you\u2019re struggling. It comes across as weakness. Was that innately programmed into me? I just thought that if I mentioned the problems I was having I wasn\u2019t going to get picked. Then I wouldn\u2019t get another contract and it would all get worse.\u201d</p> <p>When Myall did finally admit to a staff member he was sleeping poorly he was told to \u201cmake sure you jerk off before you go to sleep\u201d. No one seemed to notice when Myall started fudging his daily \u201cwellbeing\u201d tests. \u201cI was thinking: \u2018If I\u2019m too honest they\u2019re not going to play me. They\u2019re going to see how much of a hole I\u2019m in.\u2019 I was adding 30-40% to my answers.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You\u2019d expect that as players get paid more they\u2019d get looked after better but they're becoming more disposable</p> <footer> <cite>Kearnan Myall</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Now, having stepped off the remorseless treadmill of club rugby to pursue a blue with Oxford in this year\u2019s Varsity match in December, he cannot believe how much more relaxed \u2013 \u201cIt is like a weight has been lifted\u201d \u2013 he feels.

I began to think I must be a really shit person. It got to the point where I convinced myself I was worthless, that I was a burden on everybody around me. The only way I felt I could solve the problem was to take myself out of the picture and commit suicide.\u201d His early rugby life, he believes, was a contributory factor. As a promising youngster he was picked up by the Leeds academy, overseen by Stuart Lancaster, later to become the England coach. Myall has only good things to say about Lancaster \u2013 \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for him I probably wouldn\u2019t have been a professional rugby player\u201d \u2013 but his first taste of representative rugby was particularly grim. \u201cWhen I was 17 we\u2019d get sent down to England\u2019s under-18 national academy camps in Bath. The training was horrific. They got it completely wrong. I did it for a year and was thinking: \u2018I don\u2019t want to play rugby any more.\u2019\u201d When he returned to Leeds, Lancaster used him as a case study for his level five coaching qualification. One of the coach\u2019s aims was to see if he could help a fine athlete become more confident and assertive; Myall, though, was increasingly aware of being perceived by some as mentally weak based on the harsh \u2013 and, in his view, unfair \u2013 feedback from his painful national academy stint. \u201cIt was simply because I didn\u2019t want to be there. I was just getting through training because I had to.\u201d Others may now wonder if it is entirely a coincidence that several of his age-group contemporaries \u2013 Danny Cipriani, Danny Care, Ryan Lamb, Rob Webber \u2013 have also had their subsequent off-field problems. Myall was fine until \u201cout of nowhere\u201d his crippling depression struck. His off-field behaviour soon began to deteriorate. \u201cThere was a period of two to three months where I\u2019d made peace with the fact that, at some point, I was going to commit suicide. I was drinking a lot, I was spending thousands of pounds on nights out. One Saturday night, in the middle of the season, I went out and took a load of cocaine. If you\u2019re caught in competition you get banned for four years. I was 27, so it would have been the end of my career.\u201d Less than 48 hours later, fate decreed he was chosen to undergo a random drug test. He returned a positive sample. Under the Rugby Football Union\u2019s drugs policy, first-time offenders remain anonymous, cop a fine and are sent for medical help. \u201cIt was probably the best and most lucky thing that could have happened to me. It\u2019s basically a test to clean up people like me, who either have a drugs problem or are in trouble. You get fined \u00a35,000 and sent to see a psychiatrist in central London. I sat down and explained how I was feeling. Very calmly he explained I was clinically depressed. I remember sitting there thinking: \u2018I\u2019m not clinically depressed. Do you not know I\u2019m an athlete?\u2019\u201d Throughout this troubled period, remarkably, his form was excellent. \u201cI was playing some of the best rugby I\u2019d ever played. I didn\u2019t care. I was going out and just throwing my body around. It was completely unsustainable. One weekend we played Harlequins at the Ricoh. The night before I remember being on my hands and knees on my hotel room floor just crying and crying. I still felt terrible the following morning, then went out and played probably my best game of the season.\u201d Confiding in other people felt impossible. \u201cYou don\u2019t want other people to know you\u2019re struggling. It comes across as weakness. Was that innately programmed into me? I just thought that if I mentioned the problems I was having I wasn\u2019t going to get picked. Then I wouldn\u2019t get another contract and it would all get worse.\u201d When Myall did finally admit to a staff member he was sleeping poorly he was told to \u201cmake sure you jerk off before you go to sleep\u201d. No one seemed to notice when Myall started fudging his daily \u201cwellbeing\u201d tests. \u201cI was thinking: \u2018If I\u2019m too honest they\u2019re not going to play me. They\u2019re going to see how much of a hole I\u2019m in.\u2019 I was adding 30-40% to my answers.\u201d Now, having stepped off the remorseless treadmill of club rugby to pursue a blue with Oxford in this year\u2019s Varsity match in December, he cannot believe how much more relaxed \u2013 \u201cIt is like a weight has been lifted\u201d \u2013 he feels. He has a new partner and has found meditation and mindfulness hugely helpful. While completing a masters degree in neuroscience he came across extensive scientific evidence of the benefits and believes rugby needs to stop obsessing with players\u2019 gym strength at the expense of the mind. \u201cSo much time and money is spent on optimising 50% of an athlete\u2019s life. Very little is spent on the rest.\u201d Myall is also a firm believer in early intervention and a trial programme at academy level in England will form a key part of his PhD research. For all the good work being done by the RPA, the game should be hugely grateful to its lanky whistleblower for his candour, which, hopefully, will prompt a change in how the sport treats its most vital assets. \u201cRugby is an amazing game and it\u2019s given me so much but it\u2019s 24/7. Your life is your job. If you\u2019ve got a problem it filters into your entire life. \u201cA lot of the guys in charge have come from the amateur days when it\u2019s a release to come to training and bash a few heads together two to three times a week. It\u2019s a case of: \u2018You need to toughen up, get your head down, work hard.\u2019 You\u2019d expect that as players get paid more they\u2019d get looked after better but from what I\u2019ve seen they\u2019re becoming more disposable.\u201d If Myall\u2019s powerful testimony does not change attitudes, it will be a travesty.

      "body": "<p>It is hard to think of a more definitive response to an opening weekend setback. Minutes after Bayern Munich dropped their first points of the season against Hertha Berlin in Friday night\u2019s now-traditional home opener, sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic was confirming to ZDF that Philippe Coutinho was on his way from Barcelona to Bavaria.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/19/philippe-coutinho-bayern-munich-barcelona-loan-option-to-buy\">Bayern loan Philippe Coutinho from Barcelona for \u00a37.8m with option to buy </a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/19/philippe-coutinho-bayern-munich-barcelona-loan-option-to-buy\" title=\"\">Tied up and inked on Monday morning</a>, the Brazilian was one of two midfielders arriving at Allianz Arena post-Hertha, with the highly-fancied, just-turned-20 Micka\u00ebl Cuisance coming in from Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach.</p> \n<p>So why is it, after such decisive action, that more questions abound than answers? The result itself in the opener could easily be put down as just one of those things with Hertha who \u2013 despite being bold and brave under debutant coach Ante Covic, and suggesting they might be considerably more must-watch than in seasons past \u2013 rode their luck, even if <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/17/european-roundup-dortmund-crush-augsburg-monaco-crash-again\" title=\"\">Borussia Dortmund\u2019s 5-1 Saturday afternoon stroll</a> against Augsburg means that last season\u2019s challengers have an early advantage. Bayern had 70% of the ball and almost three times as many shots as the visitors.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s a question of context, with Niko Kovac not looking 100% bulletproof, and the memory of the failure to break inferior opponents in this habitual bearpit in the first half of last season not totally forgotten. The defensive vulnerabilities of last term still linger, particularly at moments like the one in which the excellent Marko Grujic strolled through to round Manuel Neuer and put Hertha in front at the end of a tasty team move in the first half. Record signing Lucas Hernandez, some will not unreasonably argue, was only an unused substitute here, having had his pre-season curbed by injury.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"92806a92-078d-4173-9962-e7ea839ff8ef\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cnRgLZ9rl7k?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Some of the doubt surrounds Coutinho himself, clearly an asset (and described as \u201ca boon to the Bundesliga\u201d by Dortmund\u2019s Julian Brandt after his team\u2019s win) but not so clearly part of a transfer market plan that looked so firmly on track when Benjamin Pavard and Hernandez were signed and sealed so early. After an interminable wait, Ivan Perisic and Coutinho have recently arrived; both stellar talents, but not the young stars earmarked to take the team forward early in the summer.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/10/premier-league-la-liga-bundesliga-serie-a-and-ligue-1-top-scorers-2019-20\">Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A and Ligue 1 top scorers 2019-20</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Where Coutinho will fit is one question. He could (and probably should) inherit James Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s old No 10 role. He could be used on the left, cutting in to great effect as he often does, as an alternative to Kingsley Coman, though he is a very different type of wide player. Some have even suggested he could be the deeper-lying playmaker that Bayern could do with, although this seems a little more far-fetched \u2013 and confusion of how he should best be utilised was a big part of Coutinho\u2019s failure to fully fire in Catalonia. How much his confidence will need piecing back together after enduring some chastening recent months at Camp Nou is another doubt. Bayern need him to be a leader, and the sooner the better.</p> \n<p>Coutinho, Hern\u00e1ndez and the rest will be tasked with making Bayern\u2019s home a daunting destination again \u2013 as they did on occasion in last season\u2019s run-in, crucially in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/apr/06/bayern-munich-borussia-dortmund-bundesliga-match-report\" title=\"\">5-0 Der Klassiker destruction of Dortmund</a> in April which swung the title race. As he spoke to the media after the match, Hertha\u2019s Dodi Lukebakio tried to suggest it already is. \u201cIt\u2019s always hard to play here,\u201d the former Watford forward ventured gamely, though it was tough to take too seriously from a man whose first-half equaliser meant he now has four on his last two trips to the Allianz, having scored a hat-trick on loan with Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf last autumn. His team\u2019s daring had suggested otherwise.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"820c48347b8ec595c8d7ef7e02eda47d29762bf0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/820c48347b8ec595c8d7ef7e02eda47d29762bf0/218_238_3173_1904/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Borussia Dortmund\u2019s Jadon Sancho scores his side\u2019s second goal in a comfortable 5-1 win over Augsburg.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Borussia Dortmund\u2019s Jadon Sancho scores his side\u2019s second goal in a comfortable 5-1 win over Augsburg.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Meissner/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Teams will always dare at Dortmund. Augsburg did, with Florian Niederlechner giving the visitors the lead after 31 seconds \u2013 the second straight opening day of the season that BVB had gone a goal down at home in the opening minute. The other aspect in common with last year was that the home side hit back, and hard. Paco Alc\u00e1cer snaffled a quick equaliser and ended the afternoon with another following a second-half blitz, punctuated by other goals from Jadon Sancho, Marco Reus and debutant Brandt. Augsburg\u2019s debutant goalkeeper Tomas Koubek looked swamped, with his raft of good saves overshadowed by a couple of major howlers.</p> \n<p>It was such a faithful facsimile of Lucien Favre\u2019s side last year that it felt difficult to draw many conclusions. We knew they could do all this already, and bigger and tougher tests are yet to come. More revealing were a clutch of more subtle tells of greater confidence, and of greater expectation. Axel Witsel ran the game, off the chain against overwhelmed opposition and able to dictate in a manner than reminded us that yes, he used to be a winger.</p> \n<p>When Reus went off for a late rest it was the returned Mats Hummels, rather than Reus\u2019s mate and replacement Mario G\u00f6tze, that took on the captain\u2019s armband. Hummels\u2019s comeback, after the manner in which he went back to Bayern in 2016, has stirred mixed emotions in the fanbase but he was bought to play a specific dual role of calming defensive presence and of veteran leader.</p> \n<p>His receipt of the armband was \u201cmore than a gesture\u201d, in the words of Ruhr Nachrichten\u2019s Dirk Krampe. Finally, the words of the players after full-time did not hide what their target is. \u201cOf course we noticed that Bayern didn\u2019t win,\u201d midfielder Julian Weigl said. \u201cIt spurred us on all the more to set a marker, and we succeeded.\u201d Coach Favre might have ducked any title chat, but his players nailed their colours to the mast. \u201cWe all watched the [Bayern] game in our hotel rooms,\u201d said Brandt, while claiming that their rivals\u2019 fortunes were \u201cof secondary importance\u201d to them. \u201cWe can be courageous and open,\u201d Weigl continued. \u201cWe have a great squad and we are a great club.\u201d</p> \n<p>Nobody on either side is hiding their light under a bushel, and the race for the Bundesliga promises to be all the better for it.</p> \n<h2>Talking points</h2> \n<p>\u2022 RB Leipzig\u2019s own start underlined that they shouldn\u2019t be left out of the title conversation either. Faced with the cold shoulder on their trip top-flight first-timers Union Berlin \u2013 the club\u2019s fans remained silent for the game\u2019s first 15 minutes in an anti-Red Bull protest \u2013 they heated things up on the field, eventually running out 4-0 winners and showing Union just what the elite are all about.

      "bodyText": "It is hard to think of a more definitive response to an opening weekend setback. Minutes after Bayern Munich dropped their first points of the season against Hertha Berlin in Friday night\u2019s now-traditional home opener, sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic was confirming to ZDF that Philippe Coutinho was on his way from Barcelona to Bavaria. Tied up and inked on Monday morning, the Brazilian was one of two midfielders arriving at Allianz Arena post-Hertha, with the highly-fancied, just-turned-20 Micka\u00ebl Cuisance coming in from Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach. So why is it, after such decisive action, that more questions abound than answers? The result itself in the opener could easily be put down as just one of those things with Hertha who \u2013 despite being bold and brave under debutant coach Ante Covic, and suggesting they might be considerably more must-watch than in seasons past \u2013 rode their luck, even if Borussia Dortmund\u2019s 5-1 Saturday afternoon stroll against Augsburg means that last season\u2019s challengers have an early advantage. Bayern had 70% of the ball and almost three times as many shots as the visitors. It\u2019s a question of context, with Niko Kovac not looking 100% bulletproof, and the memory of the failure to break inferior opponents in this habitual bearpit in the first half of last season not totally forgotten. The defensive vulnerabilities of last term still linger, particularly at moments like the one in which the excellent Marko Grujic strolled through to round Manuel Neuer and put Hertha in front at the end of a tasty team move in the first half. Record signing Lucas Hernandez, some will not unreasonably argue, was only an unused substitute here, having had his pre-season curbed by injury. Some of the doubt surrounds Coutinho himself, clearly an asset (and described as \u201ca boon to the Bundesliga\u201d by Dortmund\u2019s Julian Brandt after his team\u2019s win) but not so clearly part of a transfer market plan that looked so firmly on track when Benjamin Pavard and Hernandez were signed and sealed so early. After an interminable wait, Ivan Perisic and Coutinho have recently arrived; both stellar talents, but not the young stars earmarked to take the team forward early in the summer. Where Coutinho will fit is one question. He could (and probably should) inherit James Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s old No 10 role. He could be used on the left, cutting in to great effect as he often does, as an alternative to Kingsley Coman, though he is a very different type of wide player. Some have even suggested he could be the deeper-lying playmaker that Bayern could do with, although this seems a little more far-fetched \u2013 and confusion of how he should best be utilised was a big part of Coutinho\u2019s failure to fully fire in Catalonia. How much his confidence will need piecing back together after enduring some chastening recent months at Camp Nou is another doubt. Bayern need him to be a leader, and the sooner the better. Coutinho, Hern\u00e1ndez and the rest will be tasked with making Bayern\u2019s home a daunting destination again \u2013 as they did on occasion in last season\u2019s run-in, crucially in the 5-0 Der Klassiker destruction of Dortmund in April which swung the title race. As he spoke to the media after the match, Hertha\u2019s Dodi Lukebakio tried to suggest it already is. \u201cIt\u2019s always hard to play here,\u201d the former Watford forward ventured gamely, though it was tough to take too seriously from a man whose first-half equaliser meant he now has four on his last two trips to the Allianz, having scored a hat-trick on loan with Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf last autumn. His team\u2019s daring had suggested otherwise. Teams will always dare at Dortmund. Augsburg did, with Florian Niederlechner giving the visitors the lead after 31 seconds \u2013 the second straight opening day of the season that BVB had gone a goal down at home in the opening minute. The other aspect in common with last year was that the home side hit back, and hard. Paco Alc\u00e1cer snaffled a quick equaliser and ended the afternoon with another following a second-half blitz, punctuated by other goals from Jadon Sancho, Marco Reus and debutant Brandt. Augsburg\u2019s debutant goalkeeper Tomas Koubek looked swamped, with his raft of good saves overshadowed by a couple of major howlers. It was such a faithful facsimile of Lucien Favre\u2019s side last year that it felt difficult to draw many conclusions. We knew they could do all this already, and bigger and tougher tests are yet to come. More revealing were a clutch of more subtle tells of greater confidence, and of greater expectation. Axel Witsel ran the game, off the chain against overwhelmed opposition and able to dictate in a manner than reminded us that yes, he used to be a winger. When Reus went off for a late rest it was the returned Mats Hummels, rather than Reus\u2019s mate and replacement Mario G\u00f6tze, that took on the captain\u2019s armband. Hummels\u2019s comeback, after the manner in which he went back to Bayern in 2016, has stirred mixed emotions in the fanbase but he was bought to play a specific dual role of calming defensive presence and of veteran leader. His receipt of the armband was \u201cmore than a gesture\u201d, in the words of Ruhr Nachrichten\u2019s Dirk Krampe. Finally, the words of the players after full-time did not hide what their target is. \u201cOf course we noticed that Bayern didn\u2019t win,\u201d midfielder Julian Weigl said. \u201cIt spurred us on all the more to set a marker, and we succeeded.\u201d Coach Favre might have ducked any title chat, but his players nailed their colours to the mast. \u201cWe all watched the [Bayern] game in our hotel rooms,\u201d said Brandt, while claiming that their rivals\u2019 fortunes were \u201cof secondary importance\u201d to them. \u201cWe can be courageous and open,\u201d Weigl continued. \u201cWe have a great squad and we are a great club.\u201d Nobody on either side is hiding their light under a bushel, and the race for the Bundesliga promises to be all the better for it. Talking points \u2022 RB Leipzig\u2019s own start underlined that they shouldn\u2019t be left out of the title conversation either. Faced with the cold shoulder on their trip top-flight first-timers Union Berlin \u2013 the club\u2019s fans remained silent for the game\u2019s first 15 minutes in an anti-Red Bull protest \u2013 they heated things up on the field, eventually running out 4-0 winners and showing Union just what the elite are all about. The Julian Nagelsmann influence appears strong already. \u2022 Saturday night\u2019s big one between Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach and Schalke \u2013 and their own new coaches, Marco Rose and David Wagner respectively \u2013 was a bit of a damp squib. Gladbach, with Champions League ambitions, might not be rushing to try out new striker Breel Embolo in the No 10 role again, certainly. \u2022 Werder Bremen made history, playing their 1,867th Bundesliga game and surpassing the now-relegated Hamburg\u2019s record.

      "body": "<p>When Janine Christley moved into her new house, she thought buying woollen carpets would be the sustainable option. She had the stairs and two floors of her cottage carpeted, at a cost of thousands of pounds. Then the moths moved in. She first noticed them about four years ago, just a few at first. But then they started devouring the carpets, creating big bare patches. Gradually, Christley has had to rip them up and replace them with synthetic carpet. \u201cI\u2019ve still got woollen carpet in my room and the front room, but there are big holes where they\u2019ve eaten it away,\u201d she says. To a family of moths, it turns out, a wool-carpeted house is essentially an all-you-can-eat restaurant.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, they\u2019re into clothes as well,\u201d she says. They have eaten woollen jackets and gorged on the bags of wool she keeps for felting projects \u2013 as well as the finished works themselves. She has avoided chemical controls, but clothes regularly go into the freezer in an attempt to kill the moths\u2019 eggs. \u201cI\u2019m constantly checking where they might be,\u201d says Christley. \u201cI go into the wardrobe and shake all my clothes regularly because they like to be dark and undisturbed. I check under furniture, swat any I can find. I\u2019m always jumping up to try to catch them; I see them flying around. I\u2019m encouraging spiders in my house now; they\u2019ve got lots of cobwebs and I\u2019m trying to get them to catch the moths.\u201d It has been frustrating \u2013 and expensive. \u201cAnd it\u2019s all been a waste of time.\u201d</p> <p>In houses up and down the country, there is a war being waged against clothes moths. Among other things, it features chemical weapons, smoke bombs and armies of tiny, parasitic wasps. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/24/clothes-moths-part-in-the-circle-of-life\" title=\"\">While virtually all the 2,500 or so species of British moths are ecologically beneficial</a>, there are two that eat textiles and objects derived from animals, including wool, silk, skin and fur. They will munch through antique rugs and treasured cashmere.</p> <p>Unlike the many moths that are in decline, these moths \u2013 the webbing (or common) clothes moth and the case-bearing clothes moth \u2013 are believed to be increasing in numbers. Moth traps used by English Heritage at its properties and storage sites found <a href=\"https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/siteassets/home/learn/conservation/collections-advice--guidance/operation-clothes-moth---where-preventive-conservation-and-public-engagement-meet.pdf\" title=\"\">a 216% increase in the number of webbing clothes moths</a> caught between 2012 and 2016.

Operation Clothes Moth showed it was more widespread than we probably thought.\u201d Flats and properties built before 1950 were more likely to be affected.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b11d1330cac504e3ad4ccaf40258537e2367ad5a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b11d1330cac504e3ad4ccaf40258537e2367ad5a/0_0_4896_3264/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lavender sachets\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Natural deterrents include lavender sachets and cedarwood blocks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Natallia Khlapushyna/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are a range of reasons for the rising numbers. Hotter winters are almost certainly to blame, plus the fact we keep our homes so warm. Our housekeeping is probably not what it once was, either. Washing clothes at a lower temperature saves energy, but it means eggs are not being killed. This is less of a problem if you wear something regularly, but lots of us have so many clothes that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/aug/01/slow-fashion-how-to-keep-your-favourite-clothes-for-ever-from-laundering-to-moth-proofing\" title=\"\">outfits go unworn for months or even years</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s thought also that, nowadays, wool and other materials are less often treated with insecticides, so you don\u2019t have the residual effect that may have existed decades previously,\u201d says Nigel Blades, a preventive conservation adviser for the National Trust. \u201cIt\u2019s not always a wise use of insecticides, but it did have the effect of killing off moths.\u201d In 2008, the EU banned the use of naphthalene, a toxic, flammable chemical long used in mothballs.</p> <p>There has also been a shift back to natural fibres in carpeting and clothing, which has created food for the pests. \u201cOne of the things that worries me is the push for natural fibres for insulation,\u201d says Pinniger. \u201cWool insulation is great environmentally, but if you stick wool up in your attic you\u2019re going to get moths in it. Even worse, I know one house where they blew wool in cavity walls. They can\u2019t get it out and they\u2019ve got moths \u2013 they\u2019re going to have to live with moths the whole time they live in that house.\u201d</p> <p>The previous owners of Emma Harrison\u2019s house warned her there could be a moth problem when she moved in five years ago. She cleaned the house from top to bottom and put insecticides down. It didn\u2019t work. She discovered her clothes were being ruined, including a treasured (and expensive) coat. Carpets were devoured and had to be pulled up. She has tried hanging up bags of herbs and cedarwood, but nothing has worked. \u201cThe only thing I\u2019ve got left is either burn down my house or get the pest controllers in,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve given up on repainting because all the walls are spattered. Every morning when I wake up there are about 10 or 12 on the wall. I don\u2019t like killing creatures, but they\u2019re a menace. I had a scarf that my grandmother gave me and that\u2019s now mothridden, but I can\u2019t bring myself to get rid of it. Every time you\u2019ve got rid of them, they appear again.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Warmer winters are almost certainly to blame, plus the fact that we keep our homes so warm</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That is often around this time of year. Moths will happily breed in warm, centrally heated homes throughout the year, says Pinniger, \u201cbut there is a peak of adult emergence usually in April and May, and often another one in late August/early September when you get another generation through. Some of the museums I work with, there are moths all year round because the temperatures are constant, and we\u2019re getting at least three generations a year. Each female can lay 100 eggs. That\u2019s a pretty big potential increase.\u201d</p> <p>Moths don\u2019t eat clothes; their larvae do. They hatch within a few weeks of being laid. \u201cWhen they first hatch, they\u2019re only a millimetre long and they burrow into your clothes, so you don\u2019t see them. It\u2019s not until they get bigger that you see the evidence,\u201d says Pinniger. In ideal conditions, he says, hungry larvae will take three months to mature into moths, but it could take up to nine months. That is a lot of munching time. \u201cThey don\u2019t eat quickly, but when you\u2019ve got a lot they can produce some quite nasty damage.\u201d</p> <p>It is believed that case-bearing moths have been in the UK since at least Roman times. \u201cWe don\u2019t know whether the Romans brought them over when they invaded, although we know they have been around a long time in the UK and northern Europe,\u201d says Pinniger. The webbing clothes moth is thought to be a much more recent arrival; it is not described in scientific literature until the Victorian era. \u201cThe theory at the moment is that it probably came over from South Africa in Victorian times when they imported a lot of skin and feathers.\u201d They like the warmth \u2013 they thrive in heated buildings and aren\u2019t normally able to complete their life cycle outdoors in the UK. \u201cWhereas we know the case-bearing clothes moth can live in birds\u2019 nests,\u201d adds Pinniger.</p> <p>Clothes moths can\u2019t fly very far, so it is unlikely that they come into homes through open windows, although this is possible in urban areas. They are almost certainly introduced to a home on something such as a vintage blanket, an antique rug or a sweater from a charity shop. \u201cIn the natural world, they live in things like birds\u2019 nests and they\u2019d be eating feathers and the remains of birds,\u201d says Blades. \u201cIf a bird falls down a chimney, or you\u2019ve got a birds\u2019 nest in the chimney, that can be a source.\u201d They may have lived for years in your house without you noticing. \u201cAnd then suddenly the conditions are right and you get a population explosion,\u201d says Pinniger.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"47fa408c318f6bd49c1f8ee771cfb174e9cb717b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47fa408c318f6bd49c1f8ee771cfb174e9cb717b/572_0_2436_2436/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A webbing clothes moth larva\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018They don\u2019t eat quickly, but when you\u2019ve got a lot they can produce some quite nasty damage\u2019 ... a webbing clothes moth larva, which takes between three and nine months to mature.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David J Green/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The National Trust uses pheromone traps as part of its monitoring programme \u2013 this doesn\u2019t control the population, but gives an indication of the scale of the problem. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/may/17/clothes-moths-are-driving-me-mad-will-no-one-rid-me-of-these-troublesome-beasts\" title=\"\">The main approach </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/may/17/clothes-moths-are-driving-me-mad-will-no-one-rid-me-of-these-troublesome-beasts\" title=\"\">for controlling numbers is regular cleaning</a>. \u201cOften that can be enough,\u201d says Blades. \u201cIn some cases where we need to go beyond that, we use a commercial product called Constrain, which has a residual effect for a number of months. We use that to treat nooks and crannies where moths might like to hide away.\u201d The National Trust has done a trial using tiny parasitic wasps, which seek out moths\u2019 eggs and lay their own inside, hatching new wasps. (These wasps aren\u2019t harmful to humans, don\u2019t live long and are so small that you would barely notice them among house dust.) This was carried out in one property, but Blades says it isn\u2019t yet clear how effective it has been. </p> <p>When an object such as a rug or costume has been affected, it is treated in a commercial chest freezer, where it is cooled to -30C. Mobile heat chambers are used for furniture with upholstery, where pieces are heated to about 50C.</p> <p>Dee Lauder, a pest control manager at English Heritage, has noticed a significant increase in moths in the past 10 years and particularly in the past five. \u201cThe best way of keeping on top of it is very good management and housekeeping,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have collection-care assistants who are trained to go into the houses and carry this out all the time for us. These are increasingly the things you need to concentrate on in the average home as well. It\u2019s not a case of running a vacuum over the carpet and thinking that\u2019s done \u2013 at least once a month, and particularly during the spring and summer months, you need to thoroughly go round the edge of the carpet with a nozzle on the vacuum. Take out items in your wardrobes and give them a shake out because moths don\u2019t like disturbance.\u201d If you have carpet underneath your cupboards, you might want to think about getting rid of it, she says. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got heavy items of furniture, and sofas, you need to be pulling them out at least once a month and thoroughly vacuuming underneath. This is how we keep on top of it in historic houses.\u201d</p> <p>She recommends people store seasonal clothes in vacuum-sealed bags. \u201cYou can\u2019t really do that with historic costumes. We\u2019ll keep them boxed up and the conservators check them once or twice a year and make sure nothing is in them. Because of the significance of the collections, you cannot start spraying chemicals on them, which could cause more damage than the larvae themselves. Our approach has always been trying to do it in the most natural ways possible.\u201d It is constant, she adds. \u201cWe never get a chance to relax.\u201d</p> <p>Aerosol sprays and smoke bombs will kill moths, but if they have already laid their eggs then it is too late (they would soon die naturally anyway). Museums that Pinniger works with use insecticides concentrated around the edges of carpets, \u201cwhich work reasonably well against the larvae\u201d. Lavender sachets and cedarwood blocks may repel some adults for as long as the scent is strong. \u201cBut if the moth gets past your defences and lays eggs, it has no effect on the larvae.\u201d</p> <p>The only things that work longer-term, he says, are removing the food sources, making an effort to clean thoroughly (including sweeping chimneys to remove birds nests and debris), regularly opening and disturbing dark hiding places such as drawers and wardrobes, and killing eggs by freezing clothes. \u201cWhen you look back at early housekeeping manuals, they say you should keep your fur coats and thick jerseys in the cold store over summer.\u201d Using a freezer as a kind of wardrobe isn\u2019t necessarily as wacky as it sounds. Last year, the TV presenter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/kirstie-allsopp\" title=\"\">Kirstie Allsopp</a> said she keeps a small freezer next to her washing machine for her scarves and woollen coats. \u201cI constantly put things in to freeze the eggs and stop them in their tracks,\u201d she said. \u201cI circulate the items that go in there to be as sure as possible that moths won\u2019t suddenly strike.\u201d Moths, she said, \u201care the bane of my life. I have spent a huge amount of money on products and pest controllers and have learned the hard way that the only way to keep your home moth-free is constant vigilance.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eac446aaa6d2747fc3c751e1bf1a1d2d4d71e14c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eac446aaa6d2747fc3c751e1bf1a1d2d4d71e14c/0_0_6329_4219/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Freezer containing woollen clothes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The TV presenter Kirstie Allsopp recommends freezing clothes to kill moths\u2019 eggs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Inga Kjer/Photothek/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Is there any way we can reframe our relationships with clothes moths? \u201cI would suggest avoiding the chemical blitzkrieg that we tend towards whenever we notice something alive around us, which we never tend to win,\u201d says Rob Dunn, a professor of biology at North Carolina State University and the author of Never Home Alone, a book about all the tiny beings with which we share our homes.</p> <p>The idea that in the absence of a moth infestation your clothes are \u201cclean\u201d is wrong. \u201cAll of your clothing is covered with smaller species that you don\u2019t see,\u201d says Dunn of the microbes that live on your clothes, especially those made from natural fibres. \u201cThey\u2019re busy living on your clothes, slowly breaking it down.

      "bodyText": "When Janine Christley moved into her new house, she thought buying woollen carpets would be the sustainable option. She had the stairs and two floors of her cottage carpeted, at a cost of thousands of pounds. Then the moths moved in. She first noticed them about four years ago, just a few at first. But then they started devouring the carpets, creating big bare patches. Gradually, Christley has had to rip them up and replace them with synthetic carpet. \u201cI\u2019ve still got woollen carpet in my room and the front room, but there are big holes where they\u2019ve eaten it away,\u201d she says. To a family of moths, it turns out, a wool-carpeted house is essentially an all-you-can-eat restaurant. \u201cOf course, they\u2019re into clothes as well,\u201d she says. They have eaten woollen jackets and gorged on the bags of wool she keeps for felting projects \u2013 as well as the finished works themselves. She has avoided chemical controls, but clothes regularly go into the freezer in an attempt to kill the moths\u2019 eggs. \u201cI\u2019m constantly checking where they might be,\u201d says Christley. \u201cI go into the wardrobe and shake all my clothes regularly because they like to be dark and undisturbed. I check under furniture, swat any I can find. I\u2019m always jumping up to try to catch them; I see them flying around. I\u2019m encouraging spiders in my house now; they\u2019ve got lots of cobwebs and I\u2019m trying to get them to catch the moths.\u201d It has been frustrating \u2013 and expensive. \u201cAnd it\u2019s all been a waste of time.\u201d In houses up and down the country, there is a war being waged against clothes moths. Among other things, it features chemical weapons, smoke bombs and armies of tiny, parasitic wasps. While virtually all the 2,500 or so species of British moths are ecologically beneficial, there are two that eat textiles and objects derived from animals, including wool, silk, skin and fur. They will munch through antique rugs and treasured cashmere. Unlike the many moths that are in decline, these moths \u2013 the webbing (or common) clothes moth and the case-bearing clothes moth \u2013 are believed to be increasing in numbers. Moth traps used by English Heritage at its properties and storage sites found a 216% increase in the number of webbing clothes moths caught between 2012 and 2016. In 2017, English Heritage launched a study called Operation Clothes Moth, giving out traps to visitors to place in their homes and report back on. \u201cWe knew the numbers were rising in National Trust and English Heritage houses because we\u2019ve got regular monitoring programmes,\u201d says David Pinniger, an entomologist who has worked with many museums and historical institutions. \u201cBut we\u2019ve also got a lot of anecdotal evidence that a lot of households have seen a huge increase as well. Operation Clothes Moth showed it was more widespread than we probably thought.\u201d Flats and properties built before 1950 were more likely to be affected. There are a range of reasons for the rising numbers. Hotter winters are almost certainly to blame, plus the fact we keep our homes so warm. Our housekeeping is probably not what it once was, either. Washing clothes at a lower temperature saves energy, but it means eggs are not being killed. This is less of a problem if you wear something regularly, but lots of us have so many clothes that outfits go unworn for months or even years. \u201cIt\u2019s thought also that, nowadays, wool and other materials are less often treated with insecticides, so you don\u2019t have the residual effect that may have existed decades previously,\u201d says Nigel Blades, a preventive conservation adviser for the National Trust. \u201cIt\u2019s not always a wise use of insecticides, but it did have the effect of killing off moths.\u201d In 2008, the EU banned the use of naphthalene, a toxic, flammable chemical long used in mothballs. There has also been a shift back to natural fibres in carpeting and clothing, which has created food for the pests. \u201cOne of the things that worries me is the push for natural fibres for insulation,\u201d says Pinniger. \u201cWool insulation is great environmentally, but if you stick wool up in your attic you\u2019re going to get moths in it. Even worse, I know one house where they blew wool in cavity walls. They can\u2019t get it out and they\u2019ve got moths \u2013 they\u2019re going to have to live with moths the whole time they live in that house.\u201d The previous owners of Emma Harrison\u2019s house warned her there could be a moth problem when she moved in five years ago. She cleaned the house from top to bottom and put insecticides down. It didn\u2019t work. She discovered her clothes were being ruined, including a treasured (and expensive) coat. Carpets were devoured and had to be pulled up. She has tried hanging up bags of herbs and cedarwood, but nothing has worked. \u201cThe only thing I\u2019ve got left is either burn down my house or get the pest controllers in,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve given up on repainting because all the walls are spattered.

Large amounts of cash were found at Bashir\u2019s residence after his removal from power. \u201cThe accused told us that the money was part of a sum of $25m sent to him by [Crown] Prince Mohammed bin Salman to be used outside of the state budget,\u201d the detective, Ahmed Ali, told the court. According to Ali, Bashir said he had received two previous payments of $35m and $30m from Saudi Arabia\u2019s King Abdullah, who died in 2015. \u201cThis money was not part of the state budget and I was the one who authorised its spending,\u201d the investigator quoted Bashir as saying. He said Bashir told him the Saudi money had been spent and he could not remember how, nor did he have documents providing further details. Few in Sudan had expected ever to see Bashir, 75, appear behind bars and before judges. Pro-democracy campaigners and victims of systematic human rights abuses under his rule hope he will later also face charges of incitement and involvement in the killing of protesters. Ali, an activist freed after four months in prison when Bashir fell, said he was not gloating but was thinking of all the other dictators in Africa and the Middle East who never imagined that they might end up behind bars. Bashir, wearing a traditional white gown, arrived at the building in a military convoy of dozens of vehicles and listened impassively to the testimony from a cage in the courtroom. He did not comment during the three-hour hearing. Members of his legal team, which includes almost 100 lawyers, are optimistic the court will throw out the charges. Ahmed Ibrahim al-Tahir, a former senior official in Bashir\u2019s National Congress party, said there was no evidence against his client. \u201cThere is no evidence of the forbidden wealth so far and [possessing] foreign currency is not a crime. There is media trial for the president outside of this courtroom. There is supposed to be a rule of law and that rule of law should be implemented for everybody,\u201d Tahir said. At the weekend Sudan\u2019s military rulers and protest leaders signed a deal that is meant to pave the way for civilian rule. The agreement was welcomed by both sides, with protesters celebrating what they saw as the victory of their \u201crevolution\u201d and generals taking credit for averting a bloody civil war. Tens of thousands of people of all ages took to the streets of Khartoum on Saturday in celebration, many of them heading towards the newly renamed Freedom Square, once the site of some of Bashir\u2019s rallies. A key priority for the pro-democracy campaigners is to bring former members of Bashir\u2019s regime to justice, and this is high up in a new constitutional charter. Human rights lawyers say charges for more serious offences will come when the civilian-led government is formed. The revelations of Saudi support will reinforce fears that Gulf states are seeking to advance their interests through secret deals with rulers and key power-brokers in Sudan. Sudan\u2019s military has strong ties to the Gulf monarchies, having assisted in the Saudi-UAE war in Yemen. Much attention has been focused on Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, the head of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, which spearheaded a crackdown on protesters. He travelled to Jeddah shortly after the fall of Bashir to meet the Saudi crown prince. The backing of Egypt\u2019s Abdel Fatah al-Sisi was also important in the military takeover. Egypt used its regional influence to rally support for the new military rulers of Sudan, including financial assistance. The Sudanese authorities have refused to hand Bashir to the international criminal court in The Hague, which has accused him of criminal responsibility for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide following the killing, maiming and torture of hundreds of thousands of people in the region of Darfur. The UN estimates that 200,000 to 400,000 people died in the conflict and a further 2.7 million were displaced. Militia formed and directed by Bashir are blamed for the worst atrocities. Asim Zurgan, 34, an artist, who was beaten when protests in June were violently dispersed, said Bashir should be accountable for the murder of Sudanese citizens in conflicts during his 30-year rule, and for the killing of protesters. \u201cI hoped to seeing him actually charged with killing Sudanese people in the civil wars in South Sudan, Kordofan, Blue Nile and Darfur, as well as killing the detainees at the intelligence detentions and the killing of all the peaceful protesters from 1989,\u201d he said. The next hearing in the trial is scheduled for 24 August.",

The country is divided. Labour seek to heal it, not just by reversing cuts but by seeking a compromise on Brexit.

It looks as if he is walking straight into Johnson\u2019s trap as the latter will be able to set the election date in his own favour. Brexit for the Tories will be more than enough to wipe out Labour. It\u2019ll happen before the country has woken to the chaos of Brexit.

Labour being neutral means it will not force one position or another on their MPs who will be free to campaign and vote as they see fit. Despite what most people here seem to think, the country is still split and the only way forward is to have an open and honest conversation about it. Labour is a broad church, its voters are split over this and acting like that isn\u2019t the case is not helpful. Taking a neutral stance allows the party to debate this on its own merits (or none) and then for everyone to vote with their own conscience. It is the only party that can and has tried to actually unite the country. <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/132108647\">KingInTheNorth</a></strong></p> <h2>\u2018He\u2019s pissing into the wind on Brexit again\u2019</h2> <p>Pissing into the wind on Brexit again Jezza.

The great thing is that Labour doesn\u2019t need to come off the fence to win at the next GE and gain the remain vote. All Labour needs to do is offer a second referendum in its general election manifesto with the option to remain included in it. Anyone slightly remain inclined who is thinking rationally and wants to stop Brexit, would still vote for Labour if they offered a second referendum in it\u2019s GE manifesto, regardless of whether Labour comes out fully in support of Remain as a party. </p> <p>Given all the above, and given the serious damage of a split in the Labour vote by backing remain unequivocally, it\u2019s very hard to see how Labour will suffer from continuing on with constructive ambiguity while throwing its weight behind a second referendum <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/132108646\">vacuous</a></strong></p> <h2>\u2018He is right but any form of Brexit that compounds the problems we face won\u2019t cure them\u2019</h2> <p>Corbyn is right to note that the problems faced by the UK run much deeper than Brexit which is, after all, a symptom of those problems.

Labour is a broad church, its voters are split over this and acting like that isn\u2019t the case is not helpful. Taking a neutral stance allows the party to debate this on its own merits (or none) and then for everyone to vote with their own conscience. It is the only party that can and has tried to actually unite the country. KingInTheNorth \u2018He\u2019s pissing into the wind on Brexit again\u2019 Pissing into the wind on Brexit again Jezza. I voted for you. I support fully the economic and social approach you and McDonnell have taken. But you have to fight the enemy in front of you. And that enemy is Brexit. You missed the point and consigned us to right wing extremist hell. Thanks. Sequinner \u2018It\u2019s hard to see how Labour will suffer from continuing on with constructive ambiguity\u2019 Sound strategy to remain neutral at the next referendum. The great thing is that Labour doesn\u2019t need to come off the fence to win at the next GE and gain the remain vote. All Labour needs to do is offer a second referendum in its general election manifesto with the option to remain included in it. Anyone slightly remain inclined who is thinking rationally and wants to stop Brexit, would still vote for Labour if they offered a second referendum in it\u2019s GE manifesto, regardless of whether Labour comes out fully in support of Remain as a party. Given all the above, and given the serious damage of a split in the Labour vote by backing remain unequivocally, it\u2019s very hard to see how Labour will suffer from continuing on with constructive ambiguity while throwing its weight behind a second referendum vacuous \u2018He is right but any form of Brexit that compounds the problems we face won\u2019t cure them\u2019 Corbyn is right to note that the problems faced by the UK run much deeper than Brexit which is, after all, a symptom of those problems. Having said that, any form of Brexit that removes citizenship and rights from millions of people without their consent will compound the problems we face, not cure any of them. DJT1Million \u2018Labour cannot sit Brexit out and hope it goes away\u2019 Corbyn and the Labour leadership just don\u2019t seem to understand that until Brexit is resolved one way or another, everything else is on the back burner. They can\u2019t simply sit this out and hope it goes away \u2013 rightly or wrongly, it\u2019s currently the number one issue and it needs decisive leadership to get past it. Adrianh2017 \u2018Corbyn is correct - not spectacular, not catchy, not quotable, just correct\u2019 Corbyn is correct - not spectacular, not catchy, not quotable, just correct. The general public are being excluded from the wealth flowing to a small fraction of the population. A step change is needed to address this. So much is wrong and so much has been deliberately broken over the last 40 years that there is no guarantee a new direction exists that will lead to prosperity for all. But unless you try nothing will change. WallyGnat \u2018Spot on Jez\u2019 Spot on Jez. Britain\u2019s problems do lie far deeper than Brexit. The disconnected mentality of people who rail against Corbyn while not comprehending why Brexit happened is incredible. They\u2019ll vote against Labour because red Ed ate his sandwich in a funny way and because they can\u2019t trust the government with more taxes and then blink dumbfoundedly with an uncomprehending gaze when things continue to get worse and fall apart around them. vacuous \u2018Not a massive Corbyn fan but he\u2019s right on this one\u2019 Got to be honest, not a massive Corbyn fan, but he\u2019s right on this one. It\u2019s not about remain vs leave, we need to reunite the country and end the austerity that got us here in the first place. saxonwhittle",

When I got there I said: \u2018Hi, how\u2019s it going?\u2019 And he said: \u2018I\u2019m Jack, nice to meet you.\u2019 I was so crushed.\u201d</p> <p>Jack laughs. \u201cI don\u2019t remember us meeting. But that second time we met, I was very taken with Charlotte.\u201d They chatted throughout their shift. \u201cIt was long hours,\u201d he says. \u201cWe talked about everything from where we went to school to what type of food we liked. The manager pulled me to one side and said I needed to stop talking to Charlotte because I was distracting her from her work.\u201d And did he? \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>It was November 2011. Jack had finished university that summer and was working in the shop, and Charlotte, still at sixth form, had taken a Saturday job there for the Christmas period. After working that shift together, they exchanged numbers and agreed to go out on a date. \u201cThen he added me on Facebook,\u201d says Charlotte. \u201cI took one look at your profile picture and I thought: \u2018What have I agreed to go on a date with?\u2019 Because it was so cringe \u2013 you had one leg cocked and your collar up, leaning against the door frame.\u201d Jack laughs. \u201cI obviously thought it was a good one.\u201d</p> <p>They went out anyway, to the cinema, where they watched a terrible film. \u201cIt gave us lots to talk about,\u201d says Jack. On their second date, they took a picnic to a local stately home and walked up to the folly (it would be the location where, five years later, Jack would propose to Charlotte). \u201cI think we were official quite quickly,\u201d says Charlotte.</p> <p>What did she like about him? \u201cI thought he was quite cheeky. Jack is the sort of person who will go up to anyone and talk to them and instantly make them feel really comfortable. He\u2019s just very cheerful.\u201d Jack says: \u201cShe was very attractive but very down to earth, quirky, a bit of a bookworm.\u201d</p> <p>Charlotte went to university in Liverpool after finishing school, and the relationship survived the distance and time apart between visits. \u201cI came back from university \u2026\u201d says Charlotte. \u201cI remember the date,\u201d says Jack. Charlotte says: \u201cI had a year when I lived with my mum and dad, and you lived with your mum and dad.\u201d</p> <p>They got engaged in March 2016, and moved in together in August that year. \u201cWe never lived together until we bought a house together,\u201d says Jack.</p> <p>Why does it work? \u201cI think we balance each other out in a lot of things,\u201d says Charlotte. \u201cOur values are quite similar.

      "bodyText": "There was a point during labour when I would quite happily have ripped off every scrap of clothing, hunkered down into a squat and moaned like a pilot whale in the middle of a busy Frankie &amp; Benny\u2019s to deliver that baby. You could have thrown 10-inch four-cheese pizzas at my face and served cajun cheese fries off my head and I would hardly have noticed. Forty hours in, I was so beyond my body, so utterly absorbed by the swollen, fuzzy, monumental pressure beneath my skin, so transported by a feeling that wasn\u2019t pain but felt like the tearing open of rock, that I would hardly have noticed if a family of four from Smethwick had turned up and started eating chicken wings in the corner of the birthing room. I have never been more aware of and more occupied by the present moment in my life. Which is why, when I first read that University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff is offering labouring women virtual reality headsets during labour, I wondered, why bother? During the last 12 hours of my labour I was so completely transported by my physical experience, as I hung off door handles, appeared to slide up the wall and felt my breath leave my body like a coil of golden thread, that visions of a herd of buffalo or a quick virtual swim through a coral reef would hardly have registered. The idea of walking around my room in that wonderful east London birth centre, utterly naked but for a Daft Punk-style helmet over my pale and sweaty face, colostrum falling across my pulsating orb of a stomach, shuddering with each contraction like a freight train, seemed faintly ridiculous.

The3million, a citizens group that represents the rights of EU nationals in the UK, was responding to the news that the home secretary, Priti Patel, intended to impose new border restrictions overnight on 31 October if Britain left the EU without a deal, despite reports that an internal government discussion paper had warned that doing so could present \u201clegitimate concerns of another Windrush\u201d. The document also set out details of an alternative plan to maintain freedom of movement until January 2021 and to allow EU immigrants who came to the UK in the meantime to apply to stay under existing \u201csettled status\u201d rules. But Home Office sources told the Times that the document did not reflect government thinking and that freedom of movement for people from EU countries would end \u201con October 31 should we leave without a deal\u201d. Amid reports that the government wishes to make the change through a statutory instrument \u2013 meaning that MPs would only be required to endorse the move after its implementation \u2013 the3million said the plan could open the way to mass discrimination. The group renewed its call for all EU nationals to be automatically granted settled status and accused the prime minister, Boris Johnson, of undermining his promise to guarantee the rights and protections of EU citizens. \u201cThe idea of ending freedom of movement abruptly on 31 October in case of no deal is reckless politics,\u201d said Nicholas Hatton, the group\u2019s founder. \u201cIt hollows out the prime minister\u2019s unequivocal guarantee to EU citizens he has given only three weeks ago. \u201cEnding freedom of movement without putting legal provisions in place for those EU citizens who have not yet successfully applied through the settlement scheme will mean that millions of lawful citizens will have their legal status removed overnight. \u201cWe have been calling for the settlement scheme to be a declaratory registration scheme, so all EU citizens who have made the UK their home are automatically granted status, as promised by those in government. \u201cOtherwise this will open the door to mass discrimination under the hostile environment, with employers, landlords, banks and the NHS unable to distinguish between those EU citizens with the right to live and work in the UK and those without.\u201d A Home Office spokesperson: \u201cThe home secretary has been clear in her intention to take back control of our borders and end free movement after 31 October. \u201cEnding free movement means we are no longer required to give unlimited and uncontrolled access to those from EU countries when they are coming here seeking to work.\u201d The Home Office minister Brandon Lewis said last week that more than 1 million people had been granted settled or pre-settled status through the scheme, after 1,038,100 people applied by 31 July. It was unclear how many other EU nationals have since had their applications received. The deadline for applying to the EU settlement scheme if the UK leaves the bloc without a deal is 31 December 2020.",

      "body": "<p>Daniel Portman is soaked in sweat and locked in battle. There is an epic swell of music as he lunges at his opponent. But we\u2019re not in Westeros, where Portman became a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/apr/10/tyrion-daenerys-hot-pie-the-greatest-game-of-thrones-characters\">Game of Thrones fan favourite</a> as steadfast squire Podrick Payne. He is centre-stage at the Edinburgh fringe, in a red unitard, arm-wrestling an audience member. Portman goes over the top, the crowd cheers and he laps up the applause.</p> <p>This is Square Go, a late-night rumble of a show in which he plays 13-year-old Glaswegian daydreamer Max, hiding in the school toilets with his mate Stevie, awaiting a fight with a bully. When we meet in an Edinburgh pub, I ask Portman if he always wins the arm wrestles. \u201cGenerally, yeah,\u201d he says instantly, with easy confidence, in a voice as deep as his eyes are brown. Occasionally, some \u201cbig macho bloke\u201d gets carried away, in which case Portman will remind him: \u201cYou\u2019re fighting a 13-year-old boy who\u2019s doing this in his fantasy world. So I\u2019m gonna cheat to win.\u201d He smiles. \u201cSome people take it really seriously.\u201d</p> <p>This is what the show is about: how boys hide behind bravado right through adulthood. But there\u2019s no lecturing or hand-wringing. At the start, Portman strides in like a wrestling pro, getting the audience to feel the steel and chant his character\u2019s name. Max is psyching himself up for his \u201csquare go\u201d \u2013 Glaswegian slang for a fight \u2013 but soon crashes back to reality. \u201cYou\u2019re gonnae get pure tabernacled,\u201d Stevie reminds him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd38b0de7a27ca8d0982754c96a3f3dc59156579\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd38b0de7a27ca8d0982754c96a3f3dc59156579/0_0_4742_3165/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Pure tabernacled\u2019 \u2026 Gavin Jon Wright and Portman in Square Go, directed by Finn Den Hertog.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Pure tabernacled\u2019 \u2026 Gavin Jon Wright and Portman in Square Go, directed by Finn Den Hertog.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mihaela Bodlovic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A high-octane hour, Square Go is performed in the round. \u201cIt\u2019s exhausting,\u201d says Portman. \u201cThe energy is like a vortex.\u201d He\u2019s superb in the play \u2013 as is Gavin Jon Wright as Stevie. It\u2019s clearly a hoot to perform. Portman and Wright, who were in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/gallery/2008/jun/25/blackwatch\">Black Watch</a> together a few years back, have nailed the comic timing of the \u201cyour maw\u201d gags and putdowns that come thick and fast in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/aug/07/square-go-review-roundabout-summerhall-edinburgh-fringe-festival\">Kieran Hurley and Gary McNair\u2019s script</a>. In this very physical role, Portman proves a nimble comedian, trembling as he bobs and weaves. He is slammed to the floor repeatedly by Wright and mercilessly whacked with a blow-up wrestling doll.</p> <p>Everything is OTT, including a thumb war staged like an arena-sized showdown. \u201cWhen you\u2019re that age, your universe is school,\u201d says Portman. \u201cIt is funny that it\u2019s so grand and operatic in scale but it\u2019s nuclear to these guys. This is the end of the world. The way these characters in Max\u2019s mind are portrayed is slightly ridiculous \u2013 the luchador mask, inflatables, a guy with a big foam finger \u2013 but at that age you feel everything more.\u201d</p> <p>Portman grew up in Glasgow and had \u201ca leftwing upbringing, open-minded and fair\u201d. His dad is the actor Ron Donachie, his mum a complementary therapist. Could he relate to Max? \u201cI never felt any pressure at home but outside the house I did feel pressure to be tough. The only acceptable emotion outside the house was anger, if there was anything. Sadness wasn\u2019t allowed.\u201d He says he was arrogant: \u201cI was naturally quite big and athletic and I certainly imposed myself on people.\u201d It was through insecurity, he acknowledges, but then borrows a line from the play: \u201cEvery dick\u2019s got a reason for being a dick \u2013 it doesn\u2019t change the fact I was a dick.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The teachers who told me not to do acting asked me to talk to pupils about how much the school gave me. No chance \u2026</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What was Portman up to at Max\u2019s age? \u201cKicking a football around, having a pretty good time of it.\u201d Did he have his own square go? \u201cI got into quite a few scrapes when I was young. They always made me very sad.\u201d In hindsight, he says, he\u2019s sort of glad. \u201cSome men, if they haven\u2019t had that experience, they maybe carry it into adulthood. They still feel like they have something to prove. I don\u2019t have that.\u201d By the end of Square Go, the venue becomes stifling and reminds Portman of school fights: \u201cIf something was going to kick off it got hot. You could smell it.\u201d</p> <p>The end of Portman\u2019s school experience was soured by \u201csome very nasty rumours spread about me by a couple of guys who were very close to my heart\u201d. He says he ended up with almost no friends. Part of the problem was that he\u2019d embarked on an acting career. \u201cIt makes people uncomfortable. They go, \u2018Do something real.\u2019\u201d Apparently, this extended to the staff, with the exception of his drama teacher. \u201cThe same teachers who told me not to do it have asked me to go back and talk to pupils about how much the school gave me. Go fuck yourself. There\u2019s no chance. If I do come in, I\u2019ll say, \u2018Don\u2019t listen to these people.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf9775eba6abe0ed4a1e67af9a177c2d14f41f64\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf9775eba6abe0ed4a1e67af9a177c2d14f41f64/0_331_5000_3002/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018When you\u2019re that age your universe is school\u2019 \u2026 Daniel Portman in Square Go.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018When you\u2019re that age your universe is school\u2019 \u2026 Daniel Portman in Square Go.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mihaela Bodlovic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is his first summer performing at the fringe, and Portman feels as if he\u2019s cheating because his show is selling out and he doesn\u2019t have to flyer it. He remembers travelling from Glasgow when he was younger and watching free shows back-to-back all day. He\u2019d grown up seeing his dad on telly \u2013 Casualty one night, The Bill the next \u2013 and the big screen, notably as the master-at-arms in James Cameron\u2019s Titanic. <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Rodrik_Cassel\">Donachie even went on to have a small role in Thrones</a>, as Ser Rodrik Cassel.</p> <p>Portman made his acting debut with a youth theatre group \u2013 playing Moonface, a gangster disguised as a priest \u2013 in the Cole Porter musical Anything Goes. Looking at him today, dressed in black with an open face that seems both solemn and saintly, yet has the widest smile, the casting still makes sense.</p> <p>That production\u2019s boozy last-night celebrations had disastrous results. \u201cI gave my then girlfriend my jacket. By the time we got to the after party I was fucked. I woke up the next day and had pneumonia. I was out of action for a month.\u201d On his first day back to school, there happened to be a casting session for a Scottish horror film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/dec/09/outcast-film-review\">Outcast</a>, starring James Nesbitt. Portman auditioned on his 17th birthday and got a walk-on part.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"662e4123fbafd81a334574f783f86d6627597ce3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/662e4123fbafd81a334574f783f86d6627597ce3/0_0_3155_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Winter is coming \u2026 Portman as the loyal Podrick, with Gwendoline Christie as Brienne of Tarth.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Loyal servant \u2026 Portman as Podrick, with Gwendoline Christie as Brienne of Tarth.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sky Atlantic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What happened next? A bit of theatre at the \u00d2ran M\u00f3r in Glasgow, the BBC Scotland soap <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/may/12/view-to-a-kilt-the-tv-that-shaped-scotland\">River City</a> and \u201cthen Game of Thrones came up\u201d. The biggest show on the planet appears in conversation as casually as it pops up on Portman\u2019s sparse IMDb page. Was he intimidated, arriving on set? Nervous, yes, he answers. \u201cBut not overwhelmed.\u201d</p> <p>Was he daunted by the now famous orgy scene, where Podrick gives a group of prostitutes such pleasure that they refund his payment? \u201cWhen you\u2019re 20 and on a big TV show and the writers tell you your character is about to become the greatest lover in the world\u201d \u2013 he pauses \u2013 \u201cyou tell me how you\u2019d feel!\u201d The scene led to some \u201cinteresting journeys\u201d he laughs. The reports earlier this year about him being groped by fans at conventions were blown out of proportion he says, but adds: \u201cIt has happened a few times, with men and women doing it. It has given me a bit of an insight into what women have to deal with sometimes and it\u2019s very, very unpleasant.\u201d</p> <p>Portman first auditioned for two characters who were bumped off in season two. The producers invited him to audition instead for <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Podrick_Payne\">Podrick</a>, who survived to season eight. After the series wrapped, he was told Podrick was meant to be in just two or three episodes but they \u201cliked having him around\u201d.</p> <p>Podrick is a loyal servant of Brienne of Tarth, the resolute warrior played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/apr/13/game-of-thrones-brienne-gwendoline-christie-changed-life\">Gwendoline Christie</a>.

      "bodyText": "Daniel Portman is soaked in sweat and locked in battle. There is an epic swell of music as he lunges at his opponent. But we\u2019re not in Westeros, where Portman became a Game of Thrones fan favourite as steadfast squire Podrick Payne. He is centre-stage at the Edinburgh fringe, in a red unitard, arm-wrestling an audience member. Portman goes over the top, the crowd cheers and he laps up the applause. This is Square Go, a late-night rumble of a show in which he plays 13-year-old Glaswegian daydreamer Max, hiding in the school toilets with his mate Stevie, awaiting a fight with a bully. When we meet in an Edinburgh pub, I ask Portman if he always wins the arm wrestles. \u201cGenerally, yeah,\u201d he says instantly, with easy confidence, in a voice as deep as his eyes are brown. Occasionally, some \u201cbig macho bloke\u201d gets carried away, in which case Portman will remind him: \u201cYou\u2019re fighting a 13-year-old boy who\u2019s doing this in his fantasy world. So I\u2019m gonna cheat to win.\u201d He smiles. \u201cSome people take it really seriously.\u201d This is what the show is about: how boys hide behind bravado right through adulthood. But there\u2019s no lecturing or hand-wringing. At the start, Portman strides in like a wrestling pro, getting the audience to feel the steel and chant his character\u2019s name. Max is psyching himself up for his \u201csquare go\u201d \u2013 Glaswegian slang for a fight \u2013 but soon crashes back to reality. \u201cYou\u2019re gonnae get pure tabernacled,\u201d Stevie reminds him. A high-octane hour, Square Go is performed in the round. \u201cIt\u2019s exhausting,\u201d says Portman. \u201cThe energy is like a vortex.\u201d He\u2019s superb in the play \u2013 as is Gavin Jon Wright as Stevie. It\u2019s clearly a hoot to perform. Portman and Wright, who were in Black Watch together a few years back, have nailed the comic timing of the \u201cyour maw\u201d gags and putdowns that come thick and fast in Kieran Hurley and Gary McNair\u2019s script. In this very physical role, Portman proves a nimble comedian, trembling as he bobs and weaves. He is slammed to the floor repeatedly by Wright and mercilessly whacked with a blow-up wrestling doll. Everything is OTT, including a thumb war staged like an arena-sized showdown. \u201cWhen you\u2019re that age, your universe is school,\u201d says Portman. \u201cIt is funny that it\u2019s so grand and operatic in scale but it\u2019s nuclear to these guys. This is the end of the world. The way these characters in Max\u2019s mind are portrayed is slightly ridiculous \u2013 the luchador mask, inflatables, a guy with a big foam finger \u2013 but at that age you feel everything more.\u201d Portman grew up in Glasgow and had \u201ca leftwing upbringing, open-minded and fair\u201d. His dad is the actor Ron Donachie, his mum a complementary therapist. Could he relate to Max? \u201cI never felt any pressure at home but outside the house I did feel pressure to be tough. The only acceptable emotion outside the house was anger, if there was anything. Sadness wasn\u2019t allowed.\u201d He says he was arrogant: \u201cI was naturally quite big and athletic and I certainly imposed myself on people.\u201d It was through insecurity, he acknowledges, but then borrows a line from the play: \u201cEvery dick\u2019s got a reason for being a dick \u2013 it doesn\u2019t change the fact I was a dick.\u201d What was Portman up to at Max\u2019s age? \u201cKicking a football around, having a pretty good time of it.\u201d Did he have his own square go? \u201cI got into quite a few scrapes when I was young. They always made me very sad.\u201d In hindsight, he says, he\u2019s sort of glad. \u201cSome men, if they haven\u2019t had that experience, they maybe carry it into adulthood. They still feel like they have something to prove. I don\u2019t have that.\u201d By the end of Square Go, the venue becomes stifling and reminds Portman of school fights: \u201cIf something was going to kick off it got hot. You could smell it.\u201d The end of Portman\u2019s school experience was soured by \u201csome very nasty rumours spread about me by a couple of guys who were very close to my heart\u201d. He says he ended up with almost no friends. Part of the problem was that he\u2019d embarked on an acting career. \u201cIt makes people uncomfortable. They go, \u2018Do something real.\u2019\u201d Apparently, this extended to the staff, with the exception of his drama teacher. \u201cThe same teachers who told me not to do it have asked me to go back and talk to pupils about how much the school gave me. Go fuck yourself. There\u2019s no chance. If I do come in, I\u2019ll say, \u2018Don\u2019t listen to these people.\u2019\u201d This is his first summer performing at the fringe, and Portman feels as if he\u2019s cheating because his show is selling out and he doesn\u2019t have to flyer it. He remembers travelling from Glasgow when he was younger and watching free shows back-to-back all day. He\u2019d grown up seeing his dad on telly \u2013 Casualty one night, The Bill the next \u2013 and the big screen, notably as the master-at-arms in James Cameron\u2019s Titanic. Donachie even went on to have a small role in Thrones, as Ser Rodrik Cassel. Portman made his acting debut with a youth theatre group \u2013 playing Moonface, a gangster disguised as a priest \u2013 in the Cole Porter musical Anything Goes. Looking at him today, dressed in black with an open face that seems both solemn and saintly, yet has the widest smile, the casting still makes sense. That production\u2019s boozy last-night celebrations had disastrous results. \u201cI gave my then girlfriend my jacket. By the time we got to the after party I was fucked. I woke up the next day and had pneumonia. I was out of action for a month.\u201d On his first day back to school, there happened to be a casting session for a Scottish horror film Outcast, starring James Nesbitt. Portman auditioned on his 17th birthday and got a walk-on part. What happened next? A bit of theatre at the \u00d2ran M\u00f3r in Glasgow, the BBC Scotland soap River City and \u201cthen Game of Thrones came up\u201d. The biggest show on the planet appears in conversation as casually as it pops up on Portman\u2019s sparse IMDb page. Was he intimidated, arriving on set? Nervous, yes, he answers. \u201cBut not overwhelmed.\u201d Was he daunted by the now famous orgy scene, where Podrick gives a group of prostitutes such pleasure that they refund his payment? \u201cWhen you\u2019re 20 and on a big TV show and the writers tell you your character is about to become the greatest lover in the world\u201d \u2013 he pauses \u2013 \u201cyou tell me how you\u2019d feel!\u201d The scene led to some \u201cinteresting journeys\u201d he laughs. The reports earlier this year about him being groped by fans at conventions were blown out of proportion he says, but adds: \u201cIt has happened a few times, with men and women doing it. It has given me a bit of an insight into what women have to deal with sometimes and it\u2019s very, very unpleasant.\u201d Portman first auditioned for two characters who were bumped off in season two. The producers invited him to audition instead for Podrick, who survived to season eight. After the series wrapped, he was told Podrick was meant to be in just two or three episodes but they \u201cliked having him around\u201d. Podrick is a loyal servant of Brienne of Tarth, the resolute warrior played by Gwendoline Christie. She tells me Portman has \u201ca wonderful capacity for enjoying the absurd\u201d, which was useful during \u201clong days swathed in mud or submerged in water wearing leather and metal clothes\u201d. Does she think Portman has anything in common with Podrick? \u201cA mellifluous singing voice,\u201d she responds, \u201cand impossibly jutting cheekbones.\u201d Portman auditioned in his own voice and in received pronunciation, and the Thrones producers chose RP for Podrick. \u201cThere weren\u2019t any Scottish accents in the show,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t really know why not. Maybe they were worried people in the States wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d The majority of his encounters with fans are friendly but \u201cpeople do take the piss sometimes and think they can push me around. They expect to get Podrick Payne. They expect this shy, timid, little English boy. That\u2019s not what they get.\u201d Portman\u2019s next stage role is in The Last King of Scotland, an adaptation of Giles Foden\u2019s novel, in which he will play the medic who becomes personal physician to Idi Amin. It opens in Sheffield in September. For now he is clearly over the moon to be in Edinburgh. His Thrones pal Joe Dempsie and he were having a few drinks the other day and were handed flyers for Thrones! The Musical Parody. \u201cThey say they \u2018fix the final season\u2019,\u201d he observes.

      "bodyText": "Subscribe now to receive the morning briefing by email. Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. Trump: \u2018I don\u2019t see a recession, we\u2019re doing tremendously\u2019 Donald Trump and his advisers have dismissed the threat of a coming recession, despite concerns from the markets and warning signs elsewhere in the world. \u201cI don\u2019t see a recession,\u201d Trump told reporters on Sunday. \u201cWe\u2019re doing tremendously well. Our consumers are tremendously rich.\u201d Others may disagree, but the president\u2019s economic adviser Larry Kudlow insisted in a Fox News appearance that there was \u201cno recession on the horizon\u201d, adding: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with a little optimism?\u201d 2020 bid. The president has made the US economy central to his 2020 re-election bid, writes Sabrina Siddiqui \u2013 so an economic downturn could fatally undermine his case for a second Trump term. Greenland purchase. Trump on Sunday confirmed reports that he had considered trying to buy Greenland from Denmark. The acquisition of the world\u2019s biggest island would be \u201cessentially a large real estate deal\u201d, he said. Prince Andrew \u2018appalled\u2019 by Epstein sex abuse claims The Duke of York has said in a statement that he is \u201cappalled\u201d by the allegations of sex trafficking and abuse against his former friend Jeffrey Epstein. Prince Andrew\u2019s statement was released after new footage emerged showing him inside Epstein\u2019s Manhattan mansion in 2010, two years after the now deceased financier was first convicted of child sex offences. Buckingham Palace has strongly denied claims by a woman who said she was forced to have underage sex with the duke \u201cthree times, including one orgy\u201d. Friends and associates. Since Epstein\u2019s death, lawyers for his alleged victims have turned their attentions to his friends and associates, including the socialite Ghislaine Maxwell and the French model scout Jean-Luc Brunel. Prominent scientists. Epstein infamously surrounded himself with politicians and celebrities. But he also cultivated Harvard professors, Nobel prize winners and other leading scientists such as Stephen Hawking and Oliver Sacks, as Luke Darby reports. Iran warns US against seizing disputed tanker in open seas Iran has warned the US against trying to seize its oil tanker Adrian Darya 1 in the Mediterranean after it was released by authorities in Gibraltar, which rejected US requests for its continued detention. The tanker, formerly named Grace 1, had been at the centre of a diplomatic standoff between Tehran and the west since it was seized by UK marines off Gibraltar in early July, ostensibly for carrying oil to Syria in breach of EU sanctions. On Monday, shipping data showed it had set sail again for the Greek port of Kalamata. Front companies. The US claims the tanker, which was seized while sailing under a Panamanian flag, is controlled through a network of front companies by Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard. Written commitment. Iran last week provided a written commitment that the renamed Adrian Darya 1 would not sail to Syria or anywhere else covered by EU sanctions. Hong Kong: 1.7m defy police on peaceful pro-democracy march Some 1.7 million people \u2013 about a quarter of Hong Kong\u2019s entire population \u2013 took to the streets of the semi-autonomous territory on Sunday for a peaceful pro-democracy march, in defiance of police warnings. After two months of increasingly violent clashes between police and protesters and threats from Beijing, the authorities granted permission for a rally in the city\u2019s Victoria Park, but turned down plans for a subsequent march \u2013 a ban the demonstrators flouted, in spite of torrential rain. Political demands. Protest leaders say the Hong Kong government must respond to their political demands, which include the withdrawal of a controversial extradition bill and the establishment of an independent body to investigate police violence. Crib sheet The Icelandic prime minister, Katr\u00edn Jakobsd\u00f3ttir, joined other mourners at a \u201cfuneral\u201d ceremony on Sunday to mark the passing of Okjokull, the country\u2019s first glacier to be lost to climate change. The chairman of the Proud Boys has said the far-right \u201cwestern chauvinist\u201d group will now stage a march once a month in Portland after the city reluctantly hosted its largest far-right demonstration of the Trump era on Saturday. Adapted pig hearts could be transplanted into human patients within the next three years, potentially transforming the battle against heart disease, according to a new report which quotes the surgeon who pioneered heart transplants in the UK. A man gathering firewood on the shores of western Alaska has found a message in a bottle written by a Russian Cold War sailor in 1969. Russian media tracked down the original writer, Capt Anatoliy Botsanenko, who confirmed the note was his. Must-reads Facebook pages keeping memories of homicide victims alive Dinyal New\u2019s two sons were murdered in Oakland within three weeks of one another. Five years later, her Facebook page, Who Murdered My Child?, has 40,000 members. As Aben\u00e9 Clayton reports, social media offers grieving parents a platform to dispel the stereotypes attached to black murder victims. Does John Delaney really think he can win? John Delaney has spent $24m of his own cash on an increasingly quixotic presidential run, yet he shows no sign of quitting. Adam Gabbatt attends a Delaney event \u2013 with just 11 others \u2013 and asks what the former Maryland congressman stands to gain besides an extensive knowledge of Iowa. Why White Claw is this summer\u2019s liquid obsession The alcoholic sparkling water White Claw isn\u2019t just a drink, it\u2019s a lifestyle. At least according to fans, who have helped its sales surge 320% on last year, cleaning out stocks of the \u201chard seltzer\u201d at bars and grocery stores across the US. Kari Paul asks how the brand matches the moment. New York\u2019s forgotten queer photographer Alvin Baltrop shed light on a little-seen corner of LGBTQ culture in 70s New York, photographing gay life at the piers that lined Manhattan\u2019s west side.

My wife serves the customers, and my son has a takeaway next door; I supply the meat to them. We work as a team. It\u2019s a hard working life. I start at 7am preparing the meat for the counter, and we\u2019re open 9am-9pm, seven days a week. I\u2019m 51 and I\u2019m still working away, but I\u2019m making a living and I\u2019m happy. When I retire, if I have the stamina, I\u2019ll still do a few hours a day. I\u2019ve always worked \u2013 I\u2019m a working-class person.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I think it would have been better to stay in the EU for business reasons.

Other people use machines to cut the meat, but we still do it the traditional way, by hand. We sell British lamb; maybe Brexit will affect prices. I wouldn\u2019t know that \u2013 I\u2019m a retailer, not a wholesaler. People aren\u2019t going to stop buying meat \u2013 it\u2019s still going to sell, however the prices go. There are lots of takeaways and restaurants in Manchester that I supply, and I have two restaurants of my own, in Rusholme and Longsight.</p> \n<p>I love Manchester. I was born and bred here, and I would never go anywhere else. The Jilani name has been around for a long time \u2013 the mosques know us, the whole community knows us, and generations of people still come to buy halal meat from us.</p> \n<p>Manchester has always been a base for Asian people, from India and Pakistan. I don\u2019t feel European at all; I feel British, English. I\u2019ve been to other countries in Europe, but England\u2019s 10 times better.</p> \n<p>David Cameron made the wrong decision. I think it would have been better to stay in the EU for business reasons. I\u2019m a small businessman \u2013 we\u2019re all out to make a living. Whatever happens with Brexit, I hope the change is for the better.</p> \n<p><strong>Benny Gr\u00e4nitz, 37, butcher in Chemnitz, Germany</strong></p> \n<p>I come from five generations of butchers. More than 100 years ago my great-grandfather started specialising in meat and sausages in Chemnitz. After the [communist] GDR years, my grandfather and my father opened quite a few new branches. But things have changed fast: big supermarkets moved in, and we had to close some of our stores.</p> \n<p>Many people don\u2019t want to pay extra for good-quality meat. But I am optimistic that is changing \u2013 it seems that fewer people are buying cut-price supermarket sausages. I like my job. We can influence the whole chain, from the farmer to the customer who eats our sausages.</p> \n<p>For me, being European has its advantages. It\u2019s practical to be able to cross borders without issues. On the downside, there are lots of European rules and regulations that make my life difficult. Maybe we\u2019d have to comply with similar rules even without the EU, but they are definitely a big factor, and they have forced some local butchers to close. We\u2019ve had to invest a lot to meet their strict standards.</p> \n<p>I don\u2019t foresee any big shift for our business after Brexit. A lot will depend on how Britain fares outside the EU. If things go well, maybe other countries will want to follow suit. If things go badly, I\u2019m sure people will feel happy to stay.</p> \n<p>Twinning is a nice idea, but I didn\u2019t know we were partnered with Manchester. The two cities are well suited; they are both industrial places. We also have a D\u00fcsseldorf square in Chemnitz, named after our partner city in the former West Germany.</p> \n<p>Life in Chemnitz is quiet and pleasant. There\u2019s not much going on. Sometimes it\u2019s as if the streets have been emptied of people. Other places are livelier but I can\u2019t imagine living anywhere else.</p> \n<p><em>Interview by Jess Smee</em></p> \n<h2>The doctors</h2> \n<p><strong>Punam Krishan, 35, is a GP who lives in Glasgow with her husband and five-year-old son</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--immersive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2018/08/interactive-now-and-then-embed/embed/embed.html?mobile_before=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf9bf0f8df12c39b4e09669923a1e36fb26255ab/47_315_4152_2491/master/4152.jpg----width=1000____quality=85____s=0a8e8ba113f28cbe93778b85bdebbd0f&amp;desktop_before=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf9bf0f8df12c39b4e09669923a1e36fb26255ab/47_315_4152_2491/master/4152.jpg----width=1000____quality=85____s=0a8e8ba113f28cbe93778b85bdebbd0f&amp;label_before=Glasgow&amp;mobile_after=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8101d135d9f40d47bc9507f4112de11712103a98/56_374_5622_3373/master/5622.jpg----width=1000____quality=85____s=21090f1a0c6a231db7f96cf7a5bc4ed6&amp;desktop_after=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8101d135d9f40d47bc9507f4112de11712103a98/56_374_5622_3373/master/5622.jpg----width=1000____quality=85____s=21090f1a0c6a231db7f96cf7a5bc4ed6&amp;label_after=Turin&amp;analytics_label=1&amp;type=slider&amp;\" data-alt=\"DOCTOR slider\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2018/08/interactive-now-and-then-embed/embed/embed.html?mobile_before=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf9bf0f8df12c39b4e09669923a1e36fb26255ab/47_315_4152_2491/master/4152.jpg----width=1000____quality=85____s=0a8e8ba113f28cbe93778b85bdebbd0f&amp;desktop_before=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf9bf0f8df12c39b4e09669923a1e36fb26255ab/47_315_4152_2491/master/4152.jpg----width=1000____quality=85____s=0a8e8ba113f28cbe93778b85bdebbd0f&amp;label_before=Glasgow&amp;mobile_after=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8101d135d9f40d47bc9507f4112de11712103a98/56_374_5622_3373/master/5622.jpg----width=1000____quality=85____s=21090f1a0c6a231db7f96cf7a5bc4ed6&amp;desktop_after=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8101d135d9f40d47bc9507f4112de11712103a98/56_374_5622_3373/master/5622.jpg----width=1000____quality=85____s=21090f1a0c6a231db7f96cf7a5bc4ed6&amp;label_after=Turin&amp;analytics_label=1&amp;type=slider&amp;\">DOCTOR slider</a> \n <figcaption>\n  Punam Krishan and Antonio Barill\u00e0.

You get to be part of their big moments as well as their not-so-big moments.</p> \n<p>As a partner, I experienced stress and burnout. You work 12-hour days as a GP and then have to manage the business side, as well as juggling family life.</p> \n<p>It was encroaching on all my relationships, and I felt quite unhappy. I remember being on holiday in Turkey, ordering toilet roll for the health centre for my practice. I left my partnership in September 2017 and I\u2019ve been a locum ever since.</p> \n<p>Although my heritage is Indian (my mum and dad are from Punjab) I was born and brought up in Glasgow. I\u2019m very much part of two cultures. My mum used to take us to India every summer, and by week four I\u2019d think: \u201cI just want to go home.\u201d</p> \n<p>I love being Glaswegian; it\u2019s such a multicultural, diverse city. I didn\u2019t appreciate it until I moved to London for a few years. In London you have pockets with, for example, a large Indian population or a Caribbean community. In Glasgow, the communities are a lot more integrated.</p> \n<p>You only ever realise the value of your home town when you move away. I had my child in London and I was pretty sick afterwards. I had a severe postpartum haemorrhage, lost about 70% of my blood volume, and had heart failure and other complications. I ended up unconscious in intensive care, and my family were told I was not going to make it. After that, all I wanted was the comfort of my city and my people.</p> \n<p>Scotland didn\u2019t want to leave the EU, so there is this sense of feeling hard done by, and the fact my son hasn\u2019t had a choice in this saddens me. I want to keep him connected; I\u2019ll probably take him on more holidays to Europe after Brexit.</p> \n<p>I worry about what\u2019s going to happen to my European friends and colleagues. If they leave, how will that affect our NHS, and our wider healthcare system? A lot of our machines and drugs come from Europe. If we don\u2019t have a deal, how are we going to access these things?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d0ad81ff-9455-4a35-93c8-bb5924e0c527\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Although the idea of twinning towns predates the second world war, it was in its aftermath that the concept took hold as a way of promoting reconciliation and friendship between nations. Coventry, which suffered heavy bombing, was a pioneer. In 1942, women from the city sent a message of hope to the women of Stalingrad (now Volgograd), which had also been devastated. Two years later, the two cities agreed an official \u201cbond of friendship\u201d. Links with Kiel (1947) and Dresden (1956) followed.</p>\n    <p>In the early 1970s, as the UK prepared to join the European Economic Community, the government offered funding to encourage twinning. \u201cThe idea was that new forms of trade would be more successful if British people were culturally competent in dealing with Europeans,\u201d says Nick Clarke, associate professor of human geography at the University of Southampton. School exchanges and foreign language learning flourished.</p>\n    <p>The 21st century, however, has seen some partnerships falter, with a number of UK towns \u201cun-twinning\u201d from their European counterparts. When Peter Davies became mayor of Doncaster in 2009 he scrapped its five town-twinning arrangements, as part of a series of cash-saving measures. \u201cOnly about a dozen people ever benefited from these trips,\u201d he said. \u201cI can see that it arose out of altruistic motives after the war, but it just became about junkets.\u201d In 2011 the Tory-run town council in Bishop\u2019s Stortford ended ties with Friedberg and Villiers-sur-Marne, after more than 46 years, blaming \u201clack of interest\u201d. The Lib Dems argued it had more to do with Tory Euroscepticism.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Antonio Barill\u00e0, 57, is a family doctor working in Turin</strong></p> \n<p>I have been working as a family doctor in Turin and the wider Piedmont region for 26 years. Over the years the job has changed for the worse. There is a real lack of funding in the public sector. Bureaucracy slows us down. There are pharmaceutical and diagnostic rules that must be followed; treatment protocols that are still printed on paper. If a worker takes a sick day, they still have to present their employer with a written affidavit from their family doctor. It is this sort of bureaucratic strain that causes burnout, and motivates Italian doctors to abandon the public sector.</p> \n<p>I don\u2019t feel Turin is an important part of my identity. I was born in Reggio Calabria, in southern Italy, and came here for work. Hundreds of thousands of Italians moved from the south to Turin after the second world war. They left their cities and families to work here. Turin is a multicultural city, where Italian and foreign migrants coexist. You overcome these differences by seeking out what unites rather than divides us. My wife is Piedmontese, and we have two children. I am perfectly integrated culturally, socially and in my work.</p> \n<p>I am proudly Italian \u2013 we are a free, extraordinarily complex and unpredictable people. But I no longer recognise myself in the Europe of today, where nationalism is raging. The populism taking root in Italy is the expression of the failure of the political establishment over the past 25 years. Populist leaders are being asked to solve problems like insecurity and the decaying social fabric. People believe that European politicians have not regulated finance; they have been at its service.</p> \n<p>Brexit is simply another way to divide us, and I don\u2019t think it will bring benefits to the UK. I believe it will eventually be overturned by the people who oppose it.</p> \n<p><em>Interview by Lorenzo Tondo</em></p> \n<h2>The headteachers</h2> \n<p><strong>Bob Holderness, 48, is headteacher at The Parkside School, Norwich, a complex-needs school</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--immersive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2018/08/interactive-now-and-then-embed/embed/embed.html?mobile_before=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a70f46631630779765e972c627f1aada5396bee2/0_376_7974_4786/master/7974.jpg----width=1000____quality=85____s=41e33bea5cba496acaab556248736dd4&amp;desktop_before=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a70f46631630779765e972c627f1aada5396bee2/0_376_7974_4786/master/7974.jpg----width=2000____quality=85____s=03a2b5d96aff1d25c77ccb9c609c427f&amp;label_before=Norwich&amp;mobile_after=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/213805e39f63fd527712350234935f4ee16ab6e3/1300_1607_5580_3348/master/5580.jpg----width=1000____quality=85____s=bcef079a9aab08427b1a311137458249&amp;desktop_after=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/213805e39f63fd527712350234935f4ee16ab6e3/1300_1607_5580_3348/master/5580.jpg----width=2000____quality=85____s=5440c28501ca78a312622dff9b4cbdd0&amp;label_after=Novi Sad&amp;analytics_label=2&amp;type=slider&amp;\" data-alt=\"TEACHER slider\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2018/08/interactive-now-and-then-embed/embed/embed.html?mobile_before=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a70f46631630779765e972c627f1aada5396bee2/0_376_7974_4786/master/7974.jpg----width=1000____quality=85____s=41e33bea5cba496acaab556248736dd4&amp;desktop_before=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a70f46631630779765e972c627f1aada5396bee2/0_376_7974_4786/master/7974.jpg----width=2000____quality=85____s=03a2b5d96aff1d25c77ccb9c609c427f&amp;label_before=Norwich&amp;mobile_after=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/213805e39f63fd527712350234935f4ee16ab6e3/1300_1607_5580_3348/master/5580.jpg----width=1000____quality=85____s=bcef079a9aab08427b1a311137458249&amp;desktop_after=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/213805e39f63fd527712350234935f4ee16ab6e3/1300_1607_5580_3348/master/5580.jpg----width=2000____quality=85____s=5440c28501ca78a312622dff9b4cbdd0&amp;label_after=Novi Sad&amp;analytics_label=2&amp;type=slider&amp;\">TEACHER slider</a> \n <figcaption>\n  Bob Holderness and Violeta Strahinjevic.

All the specialist schools in Norfolk are heavily oversubscribed. We all face sustained pressure to admit more pupils to sites designed for far fewer pupils and staff. In the city centre we have the White Lion Cafe, where our pupils learn communication and interaction skills. It won a national award but we\u2019ve had to make the decision to close it, as a direct result of our budget situation.</p> \n<p>I have been in education for 25 years. I have seen so many colleagues leave the profession, citing stress and burnout. It\u2019s difficult to recruit people where we are geographically, flanked by the North Sea. However, at Parkside we have staff who have worked in the school for many years, including myself.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The original idea to twin communities after the second world war was to reduce the risk of future world conflict</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Although I have lived in a number of other places, Norwich has always been my home. I was born in Sheffield \u2013 my dad was a history lecturer at Sheffield University; he did some work on our family tree and we established that my mum\u2019s family moved from Suffolk to Norwich in 1602. I feel a sense of belonging here.</p> \n<p>The original idea to twin communities after the second world war was to reduce the risk of future world conflict and promote cultural and economic links. Both of these ideas are still valid. The link between Norwich and Novi Sad in Serbia supported many joint education ventures. I recently got in contact with a former teacher who taught at Parkside in 1985, when the twinning first happened. A team went over, and they sent resources to a complex-needs school over there. When I arrived in 2002, that link had gone cold.</p> \n<p>From a historical and political perspective, I consider myself European. I have grave concerns over the division of the country with Brexit. We need to work together to achieve a compromise.</p> \n<p><strong>Violeta Strahinjevic, 47, is director of Milan Petrovi\u0107 School for children and young people with disabilities and special educational needs, in Novi Sad, Serbia</strong></p> \n<p>I became director of the school last year, but I\u2019ve been working here for 22 years as a specialist teacher. One of the daily challenges we face is how to increase the acceptance of people with disabilities within the community. We try hard to include our children in local activities \u2013 the film festival, exhibitions, music festivals. It is essential for their social inclusion.</p> \n<p>We often collaborate with art students or professional artists \u2013 for our project Crossover they performed a stage musical in the city and surrounding villages. It is one of the many little steps we take to try to change attitudes. There is a long way to go, but I feel that in Novi Sad we are moving in the right direction.</p> \n<p>The city has always been a melting pot of nationalities, so people here are very tolerant. The cooperation and friendship with the Norfolk and Norwich Novi Sad Association was important in the 1990s, when our country and our school were going through very rough times \u2013 because of the country\u2019s isolation [through sanctions], general instability and a lack of funds. They stood by our side through good times and bad, and have been helping ever since. That is true friendship. They still fundraise for new equipment for the school, things we can\u2019t get here in Serbia, and when it arrives it\u2019s a great joy.</p> \n<p>I feel equally a citizen of Novi Sad and a citizen of Europe. I think Britain should stay in the EU. It\u2019s much more beneficial, not just for British people but for all of us, if Britain remains a member. But whatever happens, I am sure it won\u2019t influence our friendship.</p> \n<h2>The artists</h2> \n<p><strong>Lisa Gunn, 44, is an artist who works in Coventry, and is involved in the Coventry/Dresden Arts Exchange</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--immersive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2018/08/interactive-now-and-then-embed/embed/embed.html?mobile_before=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/095ede03585593967e4076d32a9c7c95fc028cb9/686_948_3428_2056/master/3428.jpg----width=500____quality=85____s=f8c245527d747be9902bee24b799ff39&amp;desktop_before=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/095ede03585593967e4076d32a9c7c95fc028cb9/686_948_3428_2056/master/3428.jpg----width=1000____quality=85____s=ca5a0f87f74185eb893f07661b70bd78&amp;label_before=Coventry&amp;mobile_after=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f52cc47925d630f14e88d7b087f9c0db4697553b/236_290_1264_759/master/1264.jpg----width=500____quality=85____s=1498b3b9b3b1ed162ad7d37e4b7c7638&amp;desktop_after=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f52cc47925d630f14e88d7b087f9c0db4697553b/236_290_1264_759/master/1264.jpg----width=1000____quality=85____s=e4274cf43b0d97ebbe63b71dd2f061a5&amp;label_after=Dresden&amp;analytics_label=7&amp;type=slider&amp;\" data-alt=\"ARTIST slider\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2018/08/interactive-now-and-then-embed/embed/embed.html?mobile_before=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/095ede03585593967e4076d32a9c7c95fc028cb9/686_948_3428_2056/master/3428.jpg----width=500____quality=85____s=f8c245527d747be9902bee24b799ff39&amp;desktop_before=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/095ede03585593967e4076d32a9c7c95fc028cb9/686_948_3428_2056/master/3428.jpg----width=1000____quality=85____s=ca5a0f87f74185eb893f07661b70bd78&amp;label_before=Coventry&amp;mobile_after=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f52cc47925d630f14e88d7b087f9c0db4697553b/236_290_1264_759/master/1264.jpg----width=500____quality=85____s=1498b3b9b3b1ed162ad7d37e4b7c7638&amp;desktop_after=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f52cc47925d630f14e88d7b087f9c0db4697553b/236_290_1264_759/master/1264.jpg----width=1000____quality=85____s=e4274cf43b0d97ebbe63b71dd2f061a5&amp;label_after=Dresden&amp;analytics_label=7&amp;type=slider&amp;\">ARTIST slider</a> \n <figcaption>\n  Lisa Gunn and Kerstin Franke-Gneuss. Photographs: Michael Danner; Stephen Burke/both the Guardian. \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>I was born in Walsgrave hospital in Coventry, and I grew up just outside the city. My father and his father were born here. Coventry is in our blood.</p> \n<p>I was in a road accident in April 1997, and the seatbelt broke my spine. I couldn\u2019t do anything for four years; I was in agonising pain. I was doing my art degree at Coventry University and my tutors were really supportive.</p> \n<p>My recent work is strongly connected with the ruins of Coventry cathedral and what they symbolise. It was devastated in the war \u2013 it\u2019s like a skeleton \u2013 and I feel a metaphorical connection. We are both physically damaged, but we are still standing.</p> \n<p>I\u2019ve only just become involved with the Coventry/Dresden Arts Exchange. I travelled to Dresden in February and took part in an exhibition called Condition Humaine, involving two artists from Coventry (including myself) and two from Dresden. It was organised around the anniversary of the bombing of Dresden in the second world war. We\u2019ve all come from cities that rose from the ashes to create something new, and the work we\u2019ve exhibited is inspired by that. The same show came to Coventry cathedral this summer.</p> \n<p>The Dresden trip was fantastic. My father came with me. Since I\u2019ve been involved in this project, I\u2019ve found out a lot about his early life. He was born under the living-room table in a Morrison shelter in an air raid on Coventry during the war.</p> \n<p>Everyone I met in Dresden was lovely \u2013 the artists and everyone connected with them. I made some great new friends. I invited them to come and stay with me.</p> \n<p>The economic impact of Brexit will definitely affect my work. Since the 2008 recession, people have become more careful about how they spend their money, and art is a luxury. I do sell work, but not as much as I used to.</p> \n<p>I feel European; I think most [European] artists do. We\u2019re part of a larger culture. I\u2019ve exhibited in Italy, France, Germany and Switzerland. We move around, we meet people \u2013 that\u2019s what we do.</p> \n<p><strong>Kerstin Franke-Gneuss, 60, is an artist who lives and works in Dresden, and is involved in the Coventry/Dresden Arts Exchange</strong></p> \n<p>I have worked as a freelance artist in Dresden since 1984. I have a studio in the K\u00fcnstlerhaus, the Artists\u2019 House, which was built 120 years ago and is custom-designed for artists to live and work in. I make prints, and create big installations in public spaces. I can only make my art here in Dresden; it is inspiring for me.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>With Brexit, there will be difficulties. This makes the connection between Coventry and Dresden all the more valuable</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The concept of twin towns brings people together. It\u2019s important for me to talk to people with different views, or ideas, to look through their eyes. For Coventry and Dresden, the main impulse is the idea of forgiveness, mutual understanding and community. It\u2019s represented in the words \u201cFather forgive\u201d, which were inscribed in Coventry [on the wall behind the altar of the cathedral] while the war was still going on. That always deeply impressed me.</p> \n<p>The theme of this year\u2019s exhibition of the Coventry/Dresden Arts Exchange is human existence in war and suffering, in reconciliation and peace. Twinning brings us closer to the \u201ccommon European home\u201d envisaged by Mikhail Gorbachev. This grand idea is being lost. Why would people want to have new borders? I come from the former GDR, and I know how small the world can be.</p> \n<p>With Brexit, there will be difficulties to overcome: new border controls, papers to fill in for customs clearance \u2013 a lot more hassle. This makes the connection and friendship between Coventry and Dresden all the more valuable.</p> \n<h2>The bar workers</h2> \n<p><strong>Milo Smith, 36, is general manager of Ninety-Nine Bar and Kitchen in Aberdeen</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--immersive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2018/08/interactive-now-and-then-embed/embed/embed.html?mobile_before=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ec94013a237b9229da7e36350f23c4561fcb8a3/276_734_4517_2709/master/4517.jpg----width=1000____quality=85____s=fd3923f91aa23c3ecf1d3aa4d802a12f&amp;desktop_before=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ec94013a237b9229da7e36350f23c4561fcb8a3/276_734_4517_2709/master/4517.jpg----width=1000____quality=85____s=fd3923f91aa23c3ecf1d3aa4d802a12f&amp;label_before=Aberdeen&amp;mobile_after=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84496f77483e9a87c332b23bbca649c67906e8a1/296_719_5733_3440/master/5733.jpg----width=1000____quality=85____s=01254096b9af8103f6ab728c13fc09a3&amp;desktop_after=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84496f77483e9a87c332b23bbca649c67906e8a1/296_719_5733_3440/master/5733.jpg----width=1000____quality=85____s=01254096b9af8103f6ab728c13fc09a3&amp;label_after=Stavanger&amp;analytics_label=1&amp;type=slider&amp;\" data-alt=\"BAR slider\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2018/08/interactive-now-and-then-embed/embed/embed.html?mobile_before=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ec94013a237b9229da7e36350f23c4561fcb8a3/276_734_4517_2709/master/4517.jpg----width=1000____quality=85____s=fd3923f91aa23c3ecf1d3aa4d802a12f&amp;desktop_before=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ec94013a237b9229da7e36350f23c4561fcb8a3/276_734_4517_2709/master/4517.jpg----width=1000____quality=85____s=fd3923f91aa23c3ecf1d3aa4d802a12f&amp;label_before=Aberdeen&amp;mobile_after=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84496f77483e9a87c332b23bbca649c67906e8a1/296_719_5733_3440/master/5733.jpg----width=1000____quality=85____s=01254096b9af8103f6ab728c13fc09a3&amp;desktop_after=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84496f77483e9a87c332b23bbca649c67906e8a1/296_719_5733_3440/master/5733.jpg----width=1000____quality=85____s=01254096b9af8103f6ab728c13fc09a3&amp;label_after=Stavanger&amp;analytics_label=1&amp;type=slider&amp;\">BAR slider</a> \n <figcaption>\n  Milo Smith and Kristine Ekeland. Photographs: Sophie Gerrard; Ben Speck/both the Guardian. \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>I\u2019ve been general manager of an eclectic wee cocktail bar for five years, and I love it. Previously, I was an art teacher at a secondary school, but there was a lot of politics and paperwork, unnecessary stress, and too many hours. Believe it or not, when I became a bar manager I started working a lot less. I\u2019ve worked in bars since I was 15, so it made sense to come back.</p> \n<p>The main challenge is the business rates, and how expensive everything\u2019s getting. Taxes, and the cost of everything from sugar to alcohol to plastic, have gone up. The minimum wage is going up. The more you work to generate a profit, the harder it becomes.</p> \n<p>I think Brexit is a total farce. I\u2019m someone who will roll my sleeves up and get on with whatever needs doing, but in this case we don\u2019t know what to get on with. Most of the drinks we stock in our bar come from Europe. Our drinks suppliers import them, so any cost implications of crossing borders after Brexit will affect us.</p> \n<p>I was born in Aberdeen and I\u2019ve lived here, on and off, for the better part of 35 years. I feel a strong identity with the city. It\u2019s quite a close-knit community. Aberdonians are pretty stubborn, and we also like to have a good time. We\u2019re the sort of people who will have a barbecue even if it starts to rain \u2013 we\u2019ll just get the brollies out. We make the most of a bad situation.</p> \n<p>The last time I was in Stavanger was four years ago, for a friend\u2019s stag do \u2013 he lives there. Both Aberdeen and Stavanger are oil and gas cities, and you can tell that as soon as you arrive. It has a similar feel, the same company names, the industrial-style buildings, trucks transporting goods.</p> \n<p>We know when the oil rig and the boat changeovers are \u2013 we get a lot of oil and gas workers coming in [to the bar], just after they come off the helicopter. The Norwegian workers and the Brits all arrive together and tend to have a few drinks before they go their separate ways.</p> \n<p><strong>Kristine Ekeland, 26, and Steffen Rege, 28, are co-owners of Hygge bar in Stavanger</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Kristine</strong> I\u2019ve been running the bar with my co-owner Steffen since March 2017. I imagine it\u2019s a demanding job in any part of the world, but here you have different challenges: Stavanger is a small city \u2013 there are about 120,000 people living here. There is quite a good nightlife, but you\u2019re fighting over the same customers.</p> \n<p>We designed the bar to create something unique. We have a gigantic wall of plants and a beer pong area. We\u2019ve just renovated using wood from an old fishing boat. We get some tourists, but it\u2019s mainly locals. We also get quite a few international students.</p> \n<p>Stavanger is home but my mum is from Brazil, so I can relate to both cultures. Steffen was born and raised in Stavanger. It\u2019s only a small place, but there\u2019s an aura here that always reels people back.</p> \n<p>Personally, I feel there are a lot of cities in the world to discover, so my goal is to move around for as long as possible. I feel European, obviously, since I\u2019ve lived 99% of my life in Norway. The Scandinavian way of living has helped shape the way I think. Growing up in Scandinavia also influenced my views politically and culturally \u2013 I am very liberal, and I value democracy in every aspect of my life, not just in politics.</p> \n<p>I don\u2019t necessarily think Brexit is a good or a bad thing. Norway isn\u2019t 100% in the EU, although it is still bound to some EU regulations, and we\u2019re happy about that. It means you\u2019re not under someone else\u2019s control.</p> \n<p><strong>Steffen</strong> The two cities have got oil in common \u2013 platforms in the North Sea. A plane goes to Aberdeen every day.</p> \n<p>I used to work for Halliburton in Aberdeen, and I thought the city was great, all the redbrick houses. The price of beer was a bit cheaper, but not much, and the food is different \u2013 a bit more greasy.</p> \n<p>I feel European. I\u2019ve been to many places but I\u2019ve never travelled outside of Europe. In terms of Brexit, there will be good or bad things whatever Britain does. It\u2019s better to be able to do things yourself, than to be told what to do.</p> \n<h2>The academics</h2> \n<p><strong>Dr Steve Wharton, 56, is a senior lecturer in French and communication, and departmental Erasmus and assistantships director at the University of Bath</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--immersive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2018/08/interactive-now-and-then-embed/embed/embed.html?mobile_before=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab6caba978b33916d340f3786c7dd77db8a369c2/242_342_4501_2700/master/4501.jpg----width=500____quality=85____s=96a9d16a55f674a7bd9bb3c803f8b904&amp;desktop_before=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab6caba978b33916d340f3786c7dd77db8a369c2/242_342_4501_2700/master/4501.jpg----width=1000____quality=85____s=899201bef2974fda8084a3c0d2a71119&amp;label_before=Bath&amp;mobile_after=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9285db9970e91d312f781c5f8eb8992a93ce932f/0_181_5315_3189/master/5315.jpg----width=1000____quality=85____s=9472a81766d9707d9a08a4511ba26cff&amp;desktop_after=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9285db9970e91d312f781c5f8eb8992a93ce932f/0_181_5315_3189/master/5315.jpg----width=1000____quality=85____s=9472a81766d9707d9a08a4511ba26cff&amp;label_after=Aix-en-Provence&amp;analytics_label=5&amp;type=slider&amp;\" data-alt=\"ACADEMICS slider\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2018/08/interactive-now-and-then-embed/embed/embed.html?mobile_before=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab6caba978b33916d340f3786c7dd77db8a369c2/242_342_4501_2700/master/4501.jpg----width=500____quality=85____s=96a9d16a55f674a7bd9bb3c803f8b904&amp;desktop_before=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab6caba978b33916d340f3786c7dd77db8a369c2/242_342_4501_2700/master/4501.jpg----width=1000____quality=85____s=899201bef2974fda8084a3c0d2a71119&amp;label_before=Bath&amp;mobile_after=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9285db9970e91d312f781c5f8eb8992a93ce932f/0_181_5315_3189/master/5315.jpg----width=1000____quality=85____s=9472a81766d9707d9a08a4511ba26cff&amp;desktop_after=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9285db9970e91d312f781c5f8eb8992a93ce932f/0_181_5315_3189/master/5315.jpg----width=1000____quality=85____s=9472a81766d9707d9a08a4511ba26cff&amp;label_after=Aix-en-Provence&amp;analytics_label=5&amp;type=slider&amp;\">ACADEMICS slider</a> \n <figcaption>\n  Dr Steve Wharton, lecturer in French and communication at the University of Bath; Dr Mauve Carbonell, history professor at Aix-Marseille university.

It gives you the chance to engage with young people, to help them to develop, and you get to do it alongside some pretty good colleagues.</p> \n<p>We do not live in an ivory tower, though. We face the same problems of pay, pensions and insecurity as any other profession. There was a national strike last year over changes to the pension scheme. I was on strike for 14 days.</p> \n<p>I\u2019ve worked at the university and lived in Bath for half my life \u2013 I\u2019m 56 now. I met my husband through the university. He now lives and works in Parma in Italy, so we travel backwards and forwards quite a lot. Brexit could affect that.</p> \n<p>I\u2019m originally from Dorset, and I felt at home within about six months of moving here. Bath is a friendly place. If I\u2019m at the bus stop I\u2019ll talk to people and they won\u2019t look sideways and move away, they will join in the conversation. There\u2019s a remarkably international presence within the city, and that\u2019s not just the students. It\u2019s home to people from France, Spain, Italy, Germany\u2026 Being European is very much part of my identity \u2013 I\u2019m a European Brit.</p> \n<p>When I was 21, I taught English at a school in Normandy for nine months. In the 90s, I taught at the Universit\u00e9 Sorbonne Nouvelle in Paris, and I lived there when I was doing my PhD.</p> \n<p>I became involved in the Bath/Aix-en-Provence town-twinning initiative in about 1998. It struck me that, since we sent students to Aix [through the Erasmus programme], it would be a good idea to become involved in the non-academic side of twinning.</p> \n<p>The decision to leave the EU is a mistake; the ridiculous mantra of taking back control of things we controlled already skewed the debate. I have colleagues who have broken down in tears because the website for registering an interest in remaining in the UK wasn\u2019t working. As a UK citizen, I felt ashamed.</p> \n<p>The University of Bath has been proactive in contacting all of its international partners and saying it wants to continue working together. There is apparently a government promise to underwrite some kind of exchange programme. But quite what that will be is something none of us knows.</p> \n<p><strong>Dr Mauve Carbonell, 40, is associate professor in history and director of the master\u2019s programme in European and International Studies at Aix-Marseille University.</strong></p> \n<p>Life as an academic in Aix is thrilling \u2013 and busy. In reality, I have two jobs: professor and researcher. I manage about 20 international cooperation agreements to encourage student and staff exchanges. The partnership with Bath is long-established and one of the most important and successful we have had.</p> \n<p>Every year we send six of our students to Bath and we welcome about six students from Bath on our master\u2019s programme. Our students have an obligatory mobility period of six months in the spring semester and a lot of them decide to go to Bath. Erasmus agreements allow them to study abroad without paying additional fees to the host university; to benefit from a grant, and to have their overseas study programme formally recognised.</p> \n<p>Aix-en-Provence is the city where I grew up as a teenager, where I studied 20 years ago and where I now work, after spending time elsewhere in France and Europe. It\u2019s a part of my identity, but it has become a smaller part as my European identity has become stronger. First I got an Erasmus grant to attend the Humboldt University in Berlin. Then, for my PhD on European integration history, I travelled to European archive centres and met people involved in the birth of the European Community. I lived a truly European experience as a young researcher. I feel at home anywhere from Tallinn to Lisbon, from Galway to Athens.</p> \n<p>We fear Brexit will limit our students\u2019 choices. Dismantling 70 years of economic and political ties is a sad and exasperating process. I don\u2019t recognise the UK I know in this madness: wasn\u2019t British democracy the most pragmatic in the world?</p> \n<p><em>Follow Guardian Cities on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardiancities\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiancities\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardiancities/?hl=en\">Instagram</a> to join the discussion, catch up on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities\">our best stories</a> or sign up for our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/may/03/sign-up-for-the-cityscape-the-best-of-guardian-cities-every-week\">weekly newsletter</a></em></p> \n<p>\u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email <a href=\"mailto:\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

      "bodyText": "The butchers Tanwir Jilani, 51, Jilani\u2019s Halal Family Butcher, Longsight, Manchester My dad was a butcher in Faisalabad, Pakistan. He came to this country in 1959 and had his own butcher\u2019s shop in Manchester. I was his apprentice. There were three of us \u2013 my older brother, me and my younger brother. I opened my business on 1 November 2001. My father was very proud; parents like their children to follow in their footsteps. My dad had tremendous ability \u2013 I won\u2019t bring myself to say I\u2019m on the same level, but maybe I\u2019m halfway there. It\u2019s a family business now. My wife serves the customers, and my son has a takeaway next door; I supply the meat to them. We work as a team. It\u2019s a hard working life. I start at 7am preparing the meat for the counter, and we\u2019re open 9am-9pm, seven days a week. I\u2019m 51 and I\u2019m still working away, but I\u2019m making a living and I\u2019m happy. When I retire, if I have the stamina, I\u2019ll still do a few hours a day. I\u2019ve always worked \u2013 I\u2019m a working-class person. I used to slaughter [animals] myself, but not now. Other people use machines to cut the meat, but we still do it the traditional way, by hand. We sell British lamb; maybe Brexit will affect prices. I wouldn\u2019t know that \u2013 I\u2019m a retailer, not a wholesaler. People aren\u2019t going to stop buying meat \u2013 it\u2019s still going to sell, however the prices go. There are lots of takeaways and restaurants in Manchester that I supply, and I have two restaurants of my own, in Rusholme and Longsight. I love Manchester. I was born and bred here, and I would never go anywhere else. The Jilani name has been around for a long time \u2013 the mosques know us, the whole community knows us, and generations of people still come to buy halal meat from us. Manchester has always been a base for Asian people, from India and Pakistan. I don\u2019t feel European at all; I feel British, English. I\u2019ve been to other countries in Europe, but England\u2019s 10 times better. David Cameron made the wrong decision. I think it would have been better to stay in the EU for business reasons. I\u2019m a small businessman \u2013 we\u2019re all out to make a living. Whatever happens with Brexit, I hope the change is for the better. Benny Gr\u00e4nitz, 37, butcher in Chemnitz, Germany I come from five generations of butchers. More than 100 years ago my great-grandfather started specialising in meat and sausages in Chemnitz. After the [communist] GDR years, my grandfather and my father opened quite a few new branches. But things have changed fast: big supermarkets moved in, and we had to close some of our stores. Many people don\u2019t want to pay extra for good-quality meat. But I am optimistic that is changing \u2013 it seems that fewer people are buying cut-price supermarket sausages. I like my job. We can influence the whole chain, from the farmer to the customer who eats our sausages. For me, being European has its advantages. It\u2019s practical to be able to cross borders without issues. On the downside, there are lots of European rules and regulations that make my life difficult. Maybe we\u2019d have to comply with similar rules even without the EU, but they are definitely a big factor, and they have forced some local butchers to close. We\u2019ve had to invest a lot to meet their strict standards. I don\u2019t foresee any big shift for our business after Brexit. A lot will depend on how Britain fares outside the EU. If things go well, maybe other countries will want to follow suit. If things go badly, I\u2019m sure people will feel happy to stay. Twinning is a nice idea, but I didn\u2019t know we were partnered with Manchester. The two cities are well suited; they are both industrial places. We also have a D\u00fcsseldorf square in Chemnitz, named after our partner city in the former West Germany. Life in Chemnitz is quiet and pleasant. There\u2019s not much going on. Sometimes it\u2019s as if the streets have been emptied of people. Other places are livelier but I can\u2019t imagine living anywhere else. Interview by Jess Smee The doctors Punam Krishan, 35, is a GP who lives in Glasgow with her husband and five-year-old son I\u2019m one of the very few GPs who still loves being a GP. People see us when they\u2019re at a crossroads \u2013 with their health, wellbeing or personal situations. You get to be part of their big moments as well as their not-so-big moments. As a partner, I experienced stress and burnout. You work 12-hour days as a GP and then have to manage the business side, as well as juggling family life. It was encroaching on all my relationships, and I felt quite unhappy. I remember being on holiday in Turkey, ordering toilet roll for the health centre for my practice. I left my partnership in September 2017 and I\u2019ve been a locum ever since. Although my heritage is Indian (my mum and dad are from Punjab) I was born and brought up in Glasgow. I\u2019m very much part of two cultures. My mum used to take us to India every summer, and by week four I\u2019d think: \u201cI just want to go home.\u201d I love being Glaswegian; it\u2019s such a multicultural, diverse city. I didn\u2019t appreciate it until I moved to London for a few years. In London you have pockets with, for example, a large Indian population or a Caribbean community. In Glasgow, the communities are a lot more integrated. You only ever realise the value of your home town when you move away. I had my child in London and I was pretty sick afterwards. I had a severe postpartum haemorrhage, lost about 70% of my blood volume, and had heart failure and other complications. I ended up unconscious in intensive care, and my family were told I was not going to make it. After that, all I wanted was the comfort of my city and my people. Scotland didn\u2019t want to leave the EU, so there is this sense of feeling hard done by, and the fact my son hasn\u2019t had a choice in this saddens me. I want to keep him connected; I\u2019ll probably take him on more holidays to Europe after Brexit. I worry about what\u2019s going to happen to my European friends and colleagues. If they leave, how will that affect our NHS, and our wider healthcare system? A lot of our machines and drugs come from Europe. If we don\u2019t have a deal, how are we going to access these things? Antonio Barill\u00e0, 57, is a family doctor working in Turin I have been working as a family doctor in Turin and the wider Piedmont region for 26 years. Over the years the job has changed for the worse. There is a real lack of funding in the public sector. Bureaucracy slows us down. There are pharmaceutical and diagnostic rules that must be followed; treatment protocols that are still printed on paper. If a worker takes a sick day, they still have to present their employer with a written affidavit from their family doctor. It is this sort of bureaucratic strain that causes burnout, and motivates Italian doctors to abandon the public sector. I don\u2019t feel Turin is an important part of my identity. I was born in Reggio Calabria, in southern Italy, and came here for work. Hundreds of thousands of Italians moved from the south to Turin after the second world war. They left their cities and families to work here. Turin is a multicultural city, where Italian and foreign migrants coexist. You overcome these differences by seeking out what unites rather than divides us. My wife is Piedmontese, and we have two children. I am perfectly integrated culturally, socially and in my work. I am proudly Italian \u2013 we are a free, extraordinarily complex and unpredictable people. But I no longer recognise myself in the Europe of today, where nationalism is raging. The populism taking root in Italy is the expression of the failure of the political establishment over the past 25 years. Populist leaders are being asked to solve problems like insecurity and the decaying social fabric. People believe that European politicians have not regulated finance; they have been at its service. Brexit is simply another way to divide us, and I don\u2019t think it will bring benefits to the UK. I believe it will eventually be overturned by the people who oppose it. Interview by Lorenzo Tondo The headteachers Bob Holderness, 48, is headteacher at The Parkside School, Norwich, a complex-needs school Parkside is an urban school that takes pupils from the whole of Norfolk. All the specialist schools in Norfolk are heavily oversubscribed. We all face sustained pressure to admit more pupils to sites designed for far fewer pupils and staff. In the city centre we have the White Lion Cafe, where our pupils learn communication and interaction skills. It won a national award but we\u2019ve had to make the decision to close it, as a direct result of our budget situation. I have been in education for 25 years. I have seen so many colleagues leave the profession, citing stress and burnout. It\u2019s difficult to recruit people where we are geographically, flanked by the North Sea. However, at Parkside we have staff who have worked in the school for many years, including myself. Although I have lived in a number of other places, Norwich has always been my home. I was born in Sheffield \u2013 my dad was a history lecturer at Sheffield University; he did some work on our family tree and we established that my mum\u2019s family moved from Suffolk to Norwich in 1602. I feel a sense of belonging here. The original idea to twin communities after the second world war was to reduce the risk of future world conflict and promote cultural and economic links. Both of these ideas are still valid. The link between Norwich and Novi Sad in Serbia supported many joint education ventures. I recently got in contact with a former teacher who taught at Parkside in 1985, when the twinning first happened. A team went over, and they sent resources to a complex-needs school over there. When I arrived in 2002, that link had gone cold. From a historical and political perspective, I consider myself European. I have grave concerns over the division of the country with Brexit. We need to work together to achieve a compromise. Violeta Strahinjevic, 47, is director of Milan Petrovi\u0107 School for children and young people with disabilities and special educational needs, in Novi Sad, Serbia I became director of the school last year, but I\u2019ve been working here for 22 years as a specialist teacher. One of the daily challenges we face is how to increase the acceptance of people with disabilities within the community. We try hard to include our children in local activities \u2013 the film festival, exhibitions, music festivals. It is essential for their social inclusion. We often collaborate with art students or professional artists \u2013 for our project Crossover they performed a stage musical in the city and surrounding villages. It is one of the many little steps we take to try to change attitudes. There is a long way to go, but I feel that in Novi Sad we are moving in the right direction. The city has always been a melting pot of nationalities, so people here are very tolerant. The cooperation and friendship with the Norfolk and Norwich Novi Sad Association was important in the 1990s, when our country and our school were going through very rough times \u2013 because of the country\u2019s isolation [through sanctions], general instability and a lack of funds. They stood by our side through good times and bad, and have been helping ever since. That is true friendship. They still fundraise for new equipment for the school, things we can\u2019t get here in Serbia, and when it arrives it\u2019s a great joy. I feel equally a citizen of Novi Sad and a citizen of Europe. I think Britain should stay in the EU. It\u2019s much more beneficial, not just for British people but for all of us, if Britain remains a member. But whatever happens, I am sure it won\u2019t influence our friendship. The artists Lisa Gunn, 44, is an artist who works in Coventry, and is involved in the Coventry/Dresden Arts Exchange I was born in Walsgrave hospital in Coventry, and I grew up just outside the city. My father and his father were born here. Coventry is in our blood. I was in a road accident in April 1997, and the seatbelt broke my spine. I couldn\u2019t do anything for four years; I was in agonising pain. I was doing my art degree at Coventry University and my tutors were really supportive. My recent work is strongly connected with the ruins of Coventry cathedral and what they symbolise. It was devastated in the war \u2013 it\u2019s like a skeleton \u2013 and I feel a metaphorical connection. We are both physically damaged, but we are still standing. I\u2019ve only just become involved with the Coventry/Dresden Arts Exchange. I travelled to Dresden in February and took part in an exhibition called Condition Humaine, involving two artists from Coventry (including myself) and two from Dresden. It was organised around the anniversary of the bombing of Dresden in the second world war. We\u2019ve all come from cities that rose from the ashes to create something new, and the work we\u2019ve exhibited is inspired by that. The same show came to Coventry cathedral this summer. The Dresden trip was fantastic. My father came with me. Since I\u2019ve been involved in this project, I\u2019ve found out a lot about his early life. He was born under the living-room table in a Morrison shelter in an air raid on Coventry during the war. Everyone I met in Dresden was lovely \u2013 the artists and everyone connected with them. I made some great new friends. I invited them to come and stay with me. The economic impact of Brexit will definitely affect my work. Since the 2008 recession, people have become more careful about how they spend their money, and art is a luxury. I do sell work, but not as much as I used to. I feel European; I think most [European] artists do. We\u2019re part of a larger culture. I\u2019ve exhibited in Italy, France, Germany and Switzerland. We move around, we meet people \u2013 that\u2019s what we do. Kerstin Franke-Gneuss, 60, is an artist who lives and works in Dresden, and is involved in the Coventry/Dresden Arts Exchange I have worked as a freelance artist in Dresden since 1984. I have a studio in the K\u00fcnstlerhaus, the Artists\u2019 House, which was built 120 years ago and is custom-designed for artists to live and work in. I make prints, and create big installations in public spaces. I can only make my art here in Dresden; it is inspiring for me. The concept of twin towns brings people together. It\u2019s important for me to talk to people with different views, or ideas, to look through their eyes. For Coventry and Dresden, the main impulse is the idea of forgiveness, mutual understanding and community. It\u2019s represented in the words \u201cFather forgive\u201d, which were inscribed in Coventry [on the wall behind the altar of the cathedral] while the war was still going on. That always deeply impressed me. The theme of this year\u2019s exhibition of the Coventry/Dresden Arts Exchange is human existence in war and suffering, in reconciliation and peace. Twinning brings us closer to the \u201ccommon European home\u201d envisaged by Mikhail Gorbachev. This grand idea is being lost. Why would people want to have new borders? I come from the former GDR, and I know how small the world can be. With Brexit, there will be difficulties to overcome: new border controls, papers to fill in for customs clearance \u2013 a lot more hassle. This makes the connection and friendship between Coventry and Dresden all the more valuable. The bar workers Milo Smith, 36, is general manager of Ninety-Nine Bar and Kitchen in Aberdeen I\u2019ve been general manager of an eclectic wee cocktail bar for five years, and I love it. Previously, I was an art teacher at a secondary school, but there was a lot of politics and paperwork, unnecessary stress, and too many hours. Believe it or not, when I became a bar manager I started working a lot less. I\u2019ve worked in bars since I was 15, so it made sense to come back. The main challenge is the business rates, and how expensive everything\u2019s getting. Taxes, and the cost of everything from sugar to alcohol to plastic, have gone up. The minimum wage is going up. The more you work to generate a profit, the harder it becomes. I think Brexit is a total farce. I\u2019m someone who will roll my sleeves up and get on with whatever needs doing, but in this case we don\u2019t know what to get on with. Most of the drinks we stock in our bar come from Europe. Our drinks suppliers import them, so any cost implications of crossing borders after Brexit will affect us. I was born in Aberdeen and I\u2019ve lived here, on and off, for the better part of 35 years. I feel a strong identity with the city. It\u2019s quite a close-knit community. Aberdonians are pretty stubborn, and we also like to have a good time. We\u2019re the sort of people who will have a barbecue even if it starts to rain \u2013 we\u2019ll just get the brollies out. We make the most of a bad situation. The last time I was in Stavanger was four years ago, for a friend\u2019s stag do \u2013 he lives there. Both Aberdeen and Stavanger are oil and gas cities, and you can tell that as soon as you arrive. It has a similar feel, the same company names, the industrial-style buildings, trucks transporting goods. We know when the oil rig and the boat changeovers are \u2013 we get a lot of oil and gas workers coming in [to the bar], just after they come off the helicopter. The Norwegian workers and the Brits all arrive together and tend to have a few drinks before they go their separate ways. Kristine Ekeland, 26, and Steffen Rege, 28, are co-owners of Hygge bar in Stavanger Kristine I\u2019ve been running the bar with my co-owner Steffen since March 2017. I imagine it\u2019s a demanding job in any part of the world, but here you have different challenges: Stavanger is a small city \u2013 there are about 120,000 people living here. There is quite a good nightlife, but you\u2019re fighting over the same customers. We designed the bar to create something unique. We have a gigantic wall of plants and a beer pong area. We\u2019ve just renovated using wood from an old fishing boat. We get some tourists, but it\u2019s mainly locals. We also get quite a few international students. Stavanger is home but my mum is from Brazil, so I can relate to both cultures. Steffen was born and raised in Stavanger. It\u2019s only a small place, but there\u2019s an aura here that always reels people back. Personally, I feel there are a lot of cities in the world to discover, so my goal is to move around for as long as possible. I feel European, obviously, since I\u2019ve lived 99% of my life in Norway. The Scandinavian way of living has helped shape the way I think. Growing up in Scandinavia also influenced my views politically and culturally \u2013 I am very liberal, and I value democracy in every aspect of my life, not just in politics. I don\u2019t necessarily think Brexit is a good or a bad thing. Norway isn\u2019t 100% in the EU, although it is still bound to some EU regulations, and we\u2019re happy about that. It means you\u2019re not under someone else\u2019s control. Steffen The two cities have got oil in common \u2013 platforms in the North Sea. A plane goes to Aberdeen every day. I used to work for Halliburton in Aberdeen, and I thought the city was great, all the redbrick houses. The price of beer was a bit cheaper, but not much, and the food is different \u2013 a bit more greasy. I feel European. I\u2019ve been to many places but I\u2019ve never travelled outside of Europe. In terms of Brexit, there will be good or bad things whatever Britain does. It\u2019s better to be able to do things yourself, than to be told what to do. The academics Dr Steve Wharton, 56, is a senior lecturer in French and communication, and departmental Erasmus and assistantships director at the University of Bath Being an academic is one of the best jobs in the world. It gives you the chance to engage with young people, to help them to develop, and you get to do it alongside some pretty good colleagues. We do not live in an ivory tower, though. We face the same problems of pay, pensions and insecurity as any other profession. There was a national strike last year over changes to the pension scheme. I was on strike for 14 days. I\u2019ve worked at the university and lived in Bath for half my life \u2013 I\u2019m 56 now. I met my husband through the university. He now lives and works in Parma in Italy, so we travel backwards and forwards quite a lot. Brexit could affect that. I\u2019m originally from Dorset, and I felt at home within about six months of moving here. Bath is a friendly place. If I\u2019m at the bus stop I\u2019ll talk to people and they won\u2019t look sideways and move away, they will join in the conversation. There\u2019s a remarkably international presence within the city, and that\u2019s not just the students. It\u2019s home to people from France, Spain, Italy, Germany\u2026 Being European is very much part of my identity \u2013 I\u2019m a European Brit. When I was 21, I taught English at a school in Normandy for nine months. In the 90s, I taught at the Universit\u00e9 Sorbonne Nouvelle in Paris, and I lived there when I was doing my PhD. I became involved in the Bath/Aix-en-Provence town-twinning initiative in about 1998. It struck me that, since we sent students to Aix [through the Erasmus programme], it would be a good idea to become involved in the non-academic side of twinning. The decision to leave the EU is a mistake; the ridiculous mantra of taking back control of things we controlled already skewed the debate. I have colleagues who have broken down in tears because the website for registering an interest in remaining in the UK wasn\u2019t working. As a UK citizen, I felt ashamed. The University of Bath has been proactive in contacting all of its international partners and saying it wants to continue working together. There is apparently a government promise to underwrite some kind of exchange programme. But quite what that will be is something none of us knows. Dr Mauve Carbonell, 40, is associate professor in history and director of the master\u2019s programme in European and International Studies at Aix-Marseille University. Life as an academic in Aix is thrilling \u2013 and busy. In reality, I have two jobs: professor and researcher. I manage about 20 international cooperation agreements to encourage student and staff exchanges. The partnership with Bath is long-established and one of the most important and successful we have had. Every year we send six of our students to Bath and we welcome about six students from Bath on our master\u2019s programme. Our students have an obligatory mobility period of six months in the spring semester and a lot of them decide to go to Bath. Erasmus agreements allow them to study abroad without paying additional fees to the host university; to benefit from a grant, and to have their overseas study programme formally recognised. Aix-en-Provence is the city where I grew up as a teenager, where I studied 20 years ago and where I now work, after spending time elsewhere in France and Europe. It\u2019s a part of my identity, but it has become a smaller part as my European identity has become stronger. First I got an Erasmus grant to attend the Humboldt University in Berlin. Then, for my PhD on European integration history, I travelled to European archive centres and met people involved in the birth of the European Community. I lived a truly European experience as a young researcher. I feel at home anywhere from Tallinn to Lisbon, from Galway to Athens. We fear Brexit will limit our students\u2019 choices. Dismantling 70 years of economic and political ties is a sad and exasperating process. I don\u2019t recognise the UK I know in this madness: wasn\u2019t British democracy the most pragmatic in the world?

      "bodyText": "Despite a seemingly unending series of gaffes and unimpressive performances in the two Democratic primary debates so far, Joe Biden retains a solid lead in almost all polls. He\u2019s been consistently between 10 to 20 percentage points ahead of his main rivals nationally and also enjoys comfortable margins in Iowa and New Hampshire. By most counts, even if Bernie Sanders\u2019 and Elizabeth Warren\u2019s projected scores were to be combined \u2013 which almost never happens when a candidate drops out \u2013 it still wouldn\u2019t be enough to match Biden\u2019s projected score. The reason for this is to be found in what many consider Biden\u2019s main weakness. He\u2019s an old-school candidate, with a policy platform and campaigning style that seem to belong to another political era. Even Barack Obama originally chose him as vice-presidential candidate to reassure electors with a message of compromise and reliability. And that was nearly 12 years ago \u2013 before anyone even thought Donald Trump could stand a chance as president! But the point is not that the Democratic party\u2019s electorate is somehow more moderate than its vociferous left-wing seems to believe. If the last six electoral cycles are anything to go by, Democratic voters have demonstrated a keen appetite for \u201cChange!\u201d and a distinct lack of enthusiasm for status quo candidates. The core of Joe Biden\u2019s popularity lies in the fact that he is the candidate that presents the most marked contrast with President Trump\u2019s governing style. Here, it\u2019s not the policies that count. In terms of policy outcomes, Trump has pursued a rather traditional Republican agenda, cutting taxes and nominating conservative judges to the Supreme Court. But that\u2019s not what people see in his Presidency: the next election is going to be a referendum on his polarizing persona and abrasive political style.

      "bodyText": "Marriage Marriage sets off egg tagliatelle and shame, insists it is the solution and not the problem or maybe that\u2019s the marriage of my husband. I don\u2019t understand what I\u2019m supposed to understand, he beefs at 3 a.m. It takes stamina going on and on as it does. His is a solid handshake. Neighbours and exes covet it. Mine is routine harassment; hung up on uteruses and training monogamy, it salves my skin with sweet grease then thrums to the slow loneliness of a mooning belly. The inner child of my marriage is oral schizoid, masochistic, prays for a defrocked rake on a white horse in all possible worlds. It has the vertiginous pout of a Lazio gargoyle and needs Reichian pulsation, emotional release, rebirth. But so much is unresolved. I nurse marriage at wayside shrines in suburban shopping centres, sweat holy tears and lettuces. It breaks my spirit on stacks of face-embossed confetti and plastic cocks. Planets, desks and thumbs go slack in a twinning mind. Baguettes and nightingales lament. I stake marriage on the North Circular under the slaked candelabra of horse chestnut flowers in June, straining for a kiss over the colossal exhaust. As a long-ago philosophy dropout, much given to idleness, late-night curries and blasphemy against Bishop Berkeley, I thoroughly warmed to Alison Winch\u2019s first collection, Darling, It\u2019s Me, recently published by Penned in the Margins.

      "bodyText": "City lobby groups are proposing cutting stock market trading hours to help make banking and asset management more accessible to women and working parents. The Investment Association, which represents City firms with \u00a37.7tn in assets under management, and the banking lobby group the Association for Financial Markets in Europe, plan to consult members on options that include reducing trading hours from 8.5 to 6.5 hours. The move could help change the culture of a high-pressure work environment that has traditionally been dominated by men willing to serve long hours. The London Stock Exchange opens at 8am until 4:30pm but traders tends to start work earlier and head home after markets finish for the day. Other equities markets across Europe follow the same opening and closing hours on local time. One of the options expected to be considered is opening stock markets an hour later at 9am and closing by 3:30pm. By lopping off an hour on each side, it is hoped that working parents will be able to more easily source childcare. The move could also help the industry address staff diversity and mental health concerns. The consultation and its proposals, first reported by Financial News, are said to be in the early stages and have yet to be finalised. Last year the Financial Conduct Authority said only 13% of staff approved to take part in regulated activities at trading firms were women. That figure was slightly higher at investment management firms at 16%. A spokeswoman for the Investment Association said: \u201cThe IA is taking a strong interest in culture across the investment management industry, from boardrooms to the trading floor, and how this can play a pivotal role in fostering good mental health and creating inclusive workplaces where employees can thrive.\u201d The stock market proposals are just one way that the Investment Association has also been trying to influence gender diversity across UK firms. This year the IA shamed 94 listed companies for failing to increase the proportion of women on their boards to at least 25%. Those who failed, including Lloyds Banking Group, Foxtons and Paddy Power, received a \u201cred top\u201d warning label on their annual reports.",

You can also catch our monthly Brexit Means \u2026 podcast here. And for daily updates, head to Andrew Sparrow\u2019s politics live blog. Top stories Jeremy Corbyn will promise to do \u201ceverything necessary to stop a disastrous no-deal Brexit\u201d as he delivers a speech on Monday in which he will accuse Boris Johnson of being a \u201cfake populist and phoney outsider\u201d in the mould of Donald Trump. The Labour leader will give a flagship speech in the key marginal seat of Corby in the east Midlands as speculation grows about an election in the coming weeks. Following the leak of documents warning of protests and food shortages in the event of a no-deal Brexit, Corbyn will attack Johnson for the Conservative party\u2019s \u201cfailure on Brexit, and its lurch to the hard right, which has provoked the crisis our country faces this autumn\u201d. The shadow chancellor said on Monday morning that Labour wanted to see parliament reconvened \u201cin the next few days\u201d to work to avoid a no-deal Brexit. But John McDonnell insisted during an interview on the BBC\u2019s Today programme that it was \u201cnon-negotiable\u201d that the Labour leader should be the figure who leads any caretaker government that could emerge. Downing Street has blamed the disclosure of detailed preparations being made under Operation Yellowhammer on a hostile former minister intent on ruining Johnson\u2019s trip to see EU leaders this week as he also prepares to make his debut at a G7 summit. The leaked document argues that the most likely scenario is severe extended delays to medicine supplies and shortages of some fresh foods, combined with price rises, if there is a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. Michael Gove, the cabinet minister responsible for no-deal planning, insisted Yellowhammer represented a \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d and said \u201csignificant\u201d steps had been taken in the last three weeks to accelerate planning. But separate leaks also show that planning of a different kind \u2013 for a general election \u2013 is being ramped up. The prime minister\u2019s No 10 operation is increasingly on an election footing, with leaked internal emails revealing he was due to meet Sir Lynton Crosby, the election guru who worked on the campaigns of David Cameron in 2015 and Theresa May in 2017. What next? Johnson\u2019s planned meetings with the French president and German chancellor come ahead of the G7 summit in Biarritz at the end of the week, where the PM is likely to meet the US president, Donald Trump, for talks about a potential post-Brexit trade deal. The general assumption of observers is that no one should expect a breakthrough from Johnson\u2019s visits to Berlin and Paris to meet Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron. He is scheduled to hold a working lunch on Thursday with Macron at the Elys\u00e9e and issue a joint declaration. In terms of political positioning, he is expected to cling to a hardline message on Brexit and the intention of his government for Britain to leave on 31 October. For now, his position is that formal talks on Brexit will only take place until the Northern Ireland backstop is removed from the withdrawal agreement negotiated by his predecessor in No 10. Don\u2019t expect much in the way of comment from European leaders about Operation Yellowhammer, although the Financial Times reports one senior EU official as saying that Johnson must come to the G7 with a credible proposal to prevent a hard border in Ireland. \u201cThe first thing to know is what detailed plan on avoiding a hard border Johnson has in mind \u2013 a plan that is compatible with the existing withdrawal agreement,\u201d the official said. Looking ahead to the G7, where the ever-unpredictable Trump is likely to give an edge to proceedings, the summit marks the first real test of Johnson on the international stage (although other states will be familiar with his approach from his time as foreign secretary). One scenario being sketched out by some was the possibility of a Trump-Johnson alliance of sorts. Tom Tugendhat, the Conservative MP who chairs the influential Commons foreign affairs committee, said it would be interesting to see if the meeting of leaders became \u201canother six and one, or five and two\u201d with the UK becoming even more part of the \u201cAmerican camp\u201d. Tugendhat told the BBC\u2019s Today programme that the UK could play the role, as it had done in the past, of a \u201cbridge\u201d between other states and the US. That\u2019s not quite a scenario other European leaders appear to be contemplating. British officials have been liaising with their EU counterparts on how to get on the right side of the trade war between the US and China, and are already treading a diplomatic fine line over the European-backed Iranian nuclear deal opposed by Trump. \u201cThis is a diplomatic quagmire of a G7,\u201d one European diplomat told the Guardian. All is meanwhile being done in Brussels to get things right on the European side and to avoid a repetition of the Salzburg summit where Theresa May was seen to have been humiliated. \u201cA frosty approach would be self-defeating,\u201d an EU official said, while admitting that Donald Tusk, president of the European council, who will also attend, did not always toe the line. The rest Avoiding no deal must be the \u201cnumber one priority\u201d for the government, according to Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI. The home secretary, Priti Patel, is pressing for freedom of movement by European nationals into the UK to end on 31 October under a no-deal Brexit, according to reports. Dominic Grieve has accused Johnson of \u201cbehaving like a demagogue\u201d and said the UK prime minister\u2019s rhetoric had led directly to him receiving death threats. As many as 40 Tory MPs are backing an attempt led by two former cabinet ministers, Philip Hammond and David Gauke, to stop a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, the Telegraph has reported. British house hunters have launched a surprise August buying spree before the scheduled Brexit date, with new data showing sales reached their highest point since 2015 during the usually sleepy summer period. Brexit party politicians have appeared on programmes that have hosted conspiracy theorists and promoted the views of prominent figures on the hard right, an analysis has found. The Democratic Unionist party has been attempting to play down the results of a poll that found almost three out of five voters in Northern Ireland would prefer a border down the Irish Sea to a hard Brexit. As many as 40,000 motorists in Ireland who are still driving with a UK licence are being warned they have just weeks to exchange it or face being put off the road in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP, has said that other members of parliament must return to the House of Commons to hold an \u201cincreasingly reckless\u201d Boris Johnson to account. Top comment Matthew d\u2019Ancona, the Guardian columnist and chairman of the Conservative thinktank Bright Blue, argues that what matters now is how those in politics who want to prevent the UK experiencing a \u201chistoric disaster\u201d respond to the challenge; how imaginative they are prepared to be; and whether they are ready to put nation before party: Let us address the bearded elephant in the room.

They remain this way until they are purchased, which can be up to 10 hours after they were caught, say activists.</p> <p>\u201cIn Chinese communities, fish are typically not considered to be fresh if they have been dead for a long period of time,\u201d said Wu Hung of the Environment and Animal Society of Taiwan (East).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2f801e2fe2512ee2a08150d41c5f6db56ca06235\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f801e2fe2512ee2a08150d41c5f6db56ca06235/0_0_3280_4928/666.jpg\" alt=\"Fish at Taipei fish market\" width=\"666\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tethered Asian sea bass at Taipei fish market.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jo-Anne McArthur/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis explains vendors\u2019 motivation to keep the fish alive until the time of sale. But it is well established that fish are vertebrate sentient beings, and given that they are reared and managed in aquaculture systems, they are subject to regulation under the Animal Protection Act and should not be treated cruelly.\u201d</p> <p>Fish tethering is believed to be practised on around 3m giant sea perch in Taiwan every year. The fish, which are also known as barramundi or Asian sea bass, are caught from one of the many sea perch aquaculture farms that dot the south-western coast, according to Wu.</p> <p>Sea perch farms comprise one of Taiwan\u2019s major fishing industries, with total production in 2017 \u2013 the latest figures available \u2013 amounting to some 20,160 tonnes, according to East. While two main species of sea perch are farmed in Taiwan, including both the Japanese sea perch (<em>Lateolabrax japonicas) </em>and the giant sea perch (<em>Lates calcarifer), </em>it is only the latter that is tethered, said Wu.</p> <p>Canadian photojournalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jo-anne-mcarthur\">Jo-Anne McArthur</a> recently travelled to Taipei\u2019s central fish market, where she <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/340321467/05174b5440\">documented the fish tethering process</a>.</p> <p>Workers forcefully prise open the gills to increase airflow, then puncture a hole in the fish\u2019s mouth with a sharp bamboo stick or similar implement. The worker then feeds a thread through the hole in the mouth to secure a knot, bends the fish into a crescent shape, ties another knot around the tail, and tightens the thread so that the fish is unable to move.</p> <p>Fish tethering is believed to have originated during the Ming dynasty more than 200 years ago in China, said Wu, where the custom is still practised on certain species of farmed fish.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"3af71057a0375b2c8f6776a7f166ec4d7d4a52b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3af71057a0375b2c8f6776a7f166ec4d7d4a52b6/0_0_13590_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tethering fish at Taipei market\" width=\"1000\" height=\"221\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tethering fish at Taipei market.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jo-Anne McArthur/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Tethering sea bass at Taipei fish market</p></li> </ul> <p>\u201cThe practice is purported to have stemmed from the lack of oxygenating equipment at the time, as binding forcefully opens the fishes\u2019 mouths and gills, and is said to increase oxygen absorption and prolong their death,\u201d said Wu.</p> <p>\u201cVendors will also splash water on the fish to keep their skin and gills moist, to further this effect.\u201d</p> <p>The practice is not endemic to Asia alone, however. <a href=\"https://www.essereanimali.org/ancheipesci/\">Undercover footage</a> taken last year by campaign group Essere Animali of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/18/horrific-footage-reveals-fish-suffocating-to-death-on-industrial-farms-in-italy\">intensive fish farming in Italy</a> shows what appear to be sea bass being tied with string into a crescent shape with the caption: \u201cFish are tied with a string that runs through their gills. This painful practice is required by some companies to guarantee their freshness.\u201d</p> <p>Under normal circumstances, fish removed from water suffer hypoxia and suffocate \u2013 but how long that takes depends on the size and species of fish, as some can live for <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-belize-fish/tropical-fish-can-live-for-months-out-of-water-idUSN1421612420071114\">months out of water</a>. Tethering prolongs a fish\u2019s suffocation, says Wu, but only works on certain species and is really only effective in humid environments.</p> <p>Fish vendor Lin, at Nanya fish market in New Taipei City, said tethering allowed for sea perch sales to continue throughout the day: \u201cThe purpose of tethering is to keep them alive longer.\u201d</p> <p>Krzysztof Wojtas, head of fish policy at the lobbying group Compassion in World Farming (CIWF), described \u201ctraditional\u201d methods such as fish tethering as a \u201ca form of torture\u201d and serve to underline how few welfare standards pertain to fish around the world.</p> <p>\u201cFish are really neglected when it comes to animal welfare standards,\u201d said Wojtas.</p> <p>\u201cAll the scientific evidence now points to fish not just feeling pain, but distress as well. We know that they are extremely intelligent, have complex social behaviours and that some can even <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fishes-use-problem-solving-and-invent-tools/\">use tools</a>. Recently, one species even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/07/scientists-find-some-fish-can-recognise-themselves-in-mirror\">passed the mirror test</a>, which demonstrates self-awareness.</p> <p>\u201cBut when you look at other animals that humans eat, say cows and pigs, there is so much debate here in the EU about how they are reared and the <a href=\"https://www.ciwf.org.uk/our-campaigns/slaughter/\">number of seconds</a> it can take for a pig to lose consciousness before slaughter. With fish we\u2019re talking about hours, just to put things in perspective.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"c58302d7aa5578c2e159ad183f5eb18a59e27dab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c58302d7aa5578c2e159ad183f5eb18a59e27dab/0_0_5000_3333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fish at Taipei fish market\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fish at Taipei fish market.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jo-Anne McArthur/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"79b0d610ce35faaf02b610ddff6e22bf8252ecf3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/79b0d610ce35faaf02b610ddff6e22bf8252ecf3/0_0_4928_3280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fish at Taipei fish market\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fish at Taipei fish market.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jo-Anne McArthur/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Humane slaughter for fish is still in its infancy worldwide.

If a fish also struggles during slaughter, it will have more bruises in its flesh and the meat itself will be of lower quality.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d03bfc74d4fc5b0ccd611b553e814719b3f7901b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d03bfc74d4fc5b0ccd611b553e814719b3f7901b/0_0_4928_3280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Preparing fish for sale at Taipei market\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Preparing fish for sale at Taipei market.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jo-Anne McArthur/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Under Taiwan\u2019s Animal Protection Act, animals prepared for slaughter cannot be tied up \u201cwithout being humanely rendered unconscious first\u201d, says Wu.

Fish tethering is popular in Taiwan, where it is believed that \u201cbow fish\u201d stay fresher for longer if they are bent into a curve and sprinkled with water to keep them alive. They remain this way until they are purchased, which can be up to 10 hours after they were caught, say activists. \u201cIn Chinese communities, fish are typically not considered to be fresh if they have been dead for a long period of time,\u201d said Wu Hung of the Environment and Animal Society of Taiwan (East). \u201cThis explains vendors\u2019 motivation to keep the fish alive until the time of sale. But it is well established that fish are vertebrate sentient beings, and given that they are reared and managed in aquaculture systems, they are subject to regulation under the Animal Protection Act and should not be treated cruelly.\u201d Fish tethering is believed to be practised on around 3m giant sea perch in Taiwan every year. The fish, which are also known as barramundi or Asian sea bass, are caught from one of the many sea perch aquaculture farms that dot the south-western coast, according to Wu. Sea perch farms comprise one of Taiwan\u2019s major fishing industries, with total production in 2017 \u2013 the latest figures available \u2013 amounting to some 20,160 tonnes, according to East. While two main species of sea perch are farmed in Taiwan, including both the Japanese sea perch (Lateolabrax japonicas) and the giant sea perch (Lates calcarifer), it is only the latter that is tethered, said Wu. Canadian photojournalist Jo-Anne McArthur recently travelled to Taipei\u2019s central fish market, where she documented the fish tethering process. Workers forcefully prise open the gills to increase airflow, then puncture a hole in the fish\u2019s mouth with a sharp bamboo stick or similar implement. The worker then feeds a thread through the hole in the mouth to secure a knot, bends the fish into a crescent shape, ties another knot around the tail, and tightens the thread so that the fish is unable to move. Fish tethering is believed to have originated during the Ming dynasty more than 200 years ago in China, said Wu, where the custom is still practised on certain species of farmed fish. Tethering sea bass at Taipei fish market \u201cThe practice is purported to have stemmed from the lack of oxygenating equipment at the time, as binding forcefully opens the fishes\u2019 mouths and gills, and is said to increase oxygen absorption and prolong their death,\u201d said Wu. \u201cVendors will also splash water on the fish to keep their skin and gills moist, to further this effect.\u201d The practice is not endemic to Asia alone, however. Undercover footage taken last year by campaign group Essere Animali of intensive fish farming in Italy shows what appear to be sea bass being tied with string into a crescent shape with the caption: \u201cFish are tied with a string that runs through their gills. This painful practice is required by some companies to guarantee their freshness.\u201d Under normal circumstances, fish removed from water suffer hypoxia and suffocate \u2013 but how long that takes depends on the size and species of fish, as some can live for months out of water. Tethering prolongs a fish\u2019s suffocation, says Wu, but only works on certain species and is really only effective in humid environments. Fish vendor Lin, at Nanya fish market in New Taipei City, said tethering allowed for sea perch sales to continue throughout the day: \u201cThe purpose of tethering is to keep them alive longer.\u201d Krzysztof Wojtas, head of fish policy at the lobbying group Compassion in World Farming (CIWF), described \u201ctraditional\u201d methods such as fish tethering as a \u201ca form of torture\u201d and serve to underline how few welfare standards pertain to fish around the world. \u201cFish are really neglected when it comes to animal welfare standards,\u201d said Wojtas. \u201cAll the scientific evidence now points to fish not just feeling pain, but distress as well. We know that they are extremely intelligent, have complex social behaviours and that some can even use tools. Recently, one species even passed the mirror test, which demonstrates self-awareness. \u201cBut when you look at other animals that humans eat, say cows and pigs, there is so much debate here in the EU about how they are reared and the number of seconds it can take for a pig to lose consciousness before slaughter. With fish we\u2019re talking about hours, just to put things in perspective.\u201d Humane slaughter for fish is still in its infancy worldwide. While some nations \u2013 among them the UK and Norway \u2013 require humane killing practices for farmed fish, the vast majority of fish caught from both farms and in the wild are simply left to suffocate. In Taiwan, vendors beat the head of bow fish in order to induce unconsciousness, but it is common for the fish to continue to flap or struggle while being killed or having their scales scraped off, said Wu. If a fish is conscious during slaughter and struggles, lactic acid and hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol are likely to flood into the fish\u2019s bloodstream, potentially tainting the meat itself, said Wojtas. \u201cThis is well established in land animals, where if an animal hasn\u2019t been slaughtered humanely and has suffered as a result, the meat is not suitable for consumption. If a fish also struggles during slaughter, it will have more bruises in its flesh and the meat itself will be of lower quality.\u201d Under Taiwan\u2019s Animal Protection Act, animals prepared for slaughter cannot be tied up \u201cwithout being humanely rendered unconscious first\u201d, says Wu. But fish markets do not fall under the definition of an abattoir, exempting them from the law. Intensive lobbying by East saw Taiwan\u2019s law-making body, the Legislative Yuan, demand in 2016 that the fisheries agency produce a report on aquatic animal welfare initiatives. Yet the report has still not been published, said Wu. \u201cTaiwan\u2019s laws are yet to require that fish slaughter adhere to humane slaughter methods, and a humane slaughter code of practice for fish has not been published.\u201d Chih-Yang Huang, an associate professor in aquaculture at National Taiwan Ocean University who has worked on the government\u2019s aquatic animal welfare initiatives, said the focus so far has been on training, inspections and the issuing of permits for safe and healthy fish farms. Whether any of that training would affect workers in wet markets or buyers of bow fish is yet to be seen, he said. \u201cThe concept of animal welfare started very late in Asia,\u201d said Chih-Yang. \u201cWe need more information, knowledge, technology and training so that animal welfare can be gradually implemented into industry and consumer markets.\u201d",

Fortunately for me, the Swiss have led the way in city swimming: for decades, cities such as Basel, Berne, Zurich and Geneva have been making rivers accessible and safe for swimmers.

Large flat-bottomed barges share the water with swimmers. Despite the shipping monsters and urban riverbanks, the water isn\u2019t rife with litter or pollution. In fact, it reminded me of moonstone, a pearlescent blend of blues and greens, surprisingly clear. It is fast-flowing and constantly swirling, eddies forming around bridge pillars.</p> <p>I entered the water from the popular swimming beach of Einstieg Rhyschwimme at the foot of art-packed <a href=\"https://www.tinguely.ch/de.html\" title=\"\">Museum Tinguely</a>. Most people swim between the Schwarzwald and Johanniter bridges and let the current take them downstream. A sign displays a swimmer\u2019s map, developed in 1984, marking the safe swimming area. There is a makeshift changing room and a couple of toilets, but that\u2019s it. No lifeguards. Swimmers enter the water at their own risk.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ac1dac554a25bc2845ce5a5e1e9a89201356f24c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac1dac554a25bc2845ce5a5e1e9a89201356f24c/0_0_4288_2573/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rheinbad Breite bathing house on the river Rhine in Basel, Switzerland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rheinbad Breite bathing house.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Armin Smailovic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I put all my belongings, including my purse, phone and passport, into a <a href=\"https://www.wickelfisch.ch/\" title=\"\">Wickelfisch</a>. These brightly coloured fish-shaped bags, sold all over the city keep clothes and possessions dry for the duration of a trip down the Rhine. I watched other swimmers entering the water: office workers folded suits and loaded Wickelfisch confidently with laptops; tourists fumbled and followed, as did I.</p> <p>The fast flow swept me downstream. This isn\u2019t for nervous swimmers: you are immediately out of your depth as you enter the strong stream and water aids are prohibited. I\u2019m an experienced swimmer and the current still unnerved me: my instinct was to swim, kick and control, but relaxing into the flow was the best way.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbedd401fe9bcda3198c2651f598c899d23c1a65\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbedd401fe9bcda3198c2651f598c899d23c1a65/0_0_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A group of male and female swimmers enter the Rhine river in Basel, Switzerland, carrying their possessions in brightly coloured waterproof Wickelfisch bags.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Swimmers carrying their possessions in a Wickelfisch bag.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Markus Buehler</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is plenty of room, with large red buoys marking the swimming area off from that used by boats. The adventure is just over 2km of downstream floating and I had a stupid grin on my face the whole way. Floating down a fast-flowing city centre river goes against all the \u201crules\u201d we like to outline to swimmers in the UK: like knowing your exit point, and urban areas being often unclean, unsafe. But this was the perfect way to see the sights.</p> <p>I passed the first of four historic ferry boats that take passengers across the river powered solely by the current. Basel is famous for its blend of historic buildings, such as the <a href=\"https://www.baslermuenster.ch/\" title=\"\">Basler M\u00fcnster</a> (cathedral) and contemporary museums, apartments and commercial buildings. From the water you get a great view of how the city has developed. I swooshed through the arches of Mittlere Br\u00fccke, built in 1226 and in no time at all found myself in the midst of the city, looking at riverbanks draped with sunbathers.</p> <p>Concrete steps at the water\u2019s edge offered swimmers a number of exit opportunities. I set my eyes on orange and green parasols surrounding a popular buvette \u2013 an outdoor bar that only operates in summer months. Exiting the water was almost as unsettling as getting in, though. I narrowly missed a string of wooden boats before planting my feet. The whole trip took about 30 minutes and all I wanted to do after was walk back upstream and do it all over again.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"80c4ec9830daca807a991a3476c79b79cee46e96\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/80c4ec9830daca807a991a3476c79b79cee46e96/0_483_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ferry across the Rhine.

Selina told me it is rare that people get in trouble, and if they do it is often because they misjudge their own swimming ability. We took the same route together, only this time we walked back upstream afterwards, drank iced tea from buvettes and ate ice-cream on the warm slabs of concrete that dried our bodies before we plunged back in.</p> <p>Selina explained that the current is usually faster and water level higher than in this hot summer week, so what I had experienced was tame. I spent the afternoon with Selina both of us just in swimwear, not thinking twice about the fact we were walking around the city clad like this. Along the embankment on <a href=\"https://www.basel.com/en/Districts-of-Basel/District-Kleinbasel\" title=\"\">the Kleinbasel side of the river</a> there are plenty of places to get into and out of the water.</p> <p>Swimming in the Rhine feels like you are in the soul of the city but Basel has plenty else on offer. Its history is fascinating and I found myself walking the same steps with new eyes after an hour\u2019s walking tour with a guide uncovering secrets of the city. I discovered that bathing in Basel isn\u2019t just reserved for the Rhine; more than 200 historic fountains across the city are also popular for cooling off in.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b05e1e1fccb6732226047f06588f689dec21a5c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b05e1e1fccb6732226047f06588f689dec21a5c9/0_180_1500_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People sit on a concrete slab at the edge of the River Rhine in Basel with a view of the city skyline.

Most people swim between the Schwarzwald and Johanniter bridges and let the current take them downstream. A sign displays a swimmer\u2019s map, developed in 1984, marking the safe swimming area. There is a makeshift changing room and a couple of toilets, but that\u2019s it. No lifeguards. Swimmers enter the water at their own risk. I put all my belongings, including my purse, phone and passport, into a Wickelfisch. These brightly coloured fish-shaped bags, sold all over the city keep clothes and possessions dry for the duration of a trip down the Rhine. I watched other swimmers entering the water: office workers folded suits and loaded Wickelfisch confidently with laptops; tourists fumbled and followed, as did I. The fast flow swept me downstream. This isn\u2019t for nervous swimmers: you are immediately out of your depth as you enter the strong stream and water aids are prohibited. I\u2019m an experienced swimmer and the current still unnerved me: my instinct was to swim, kick and control, but relaxing into the flow was the best way. There is plenty of room, with large red buoys marking the swimming area off from that used by boats. The adventure is just over 2km of downstream floating and I had a stupid grin on my face the whole way. Floating down a fast-flowing city centre river goes against all the \u201crules\u201d we like to outline to swimmers in the UK: like knowing your exit point, and urban areas being often unclean, unsafe. But this was the perfect way to see the sights. I passed the first of four historic ferry boats that take passengers across the river powered solely by the current. Basel is famous for its blend of historic buildings, such as the Basler M\u00fcnster (cathedral) and contemporary museums, apartments and commercial buildings. From the water you get a great view of how the city has developed. I swooshed through the arches of Mittlere Br\u00fccke, built in 1226 and in no time at all found myself in the midst of the city, looking at riverbanks draped with sunbathers. Concrete steps at the water\u2019s edge offered swimmers a number of exit opportunities. I set my eyes on orange and green parasols surrounding a popular buvette \u2013 an outdoor bar that only operates in summer months. Exiting the water was almost as unsettling as getting in, though. I narrowly missed a string of wooden boats before planting my feet. The whole trip took about 30 minutes and all I wanted to do after was walk back upstream and do it all over again. Later in the week I joined Selina Speck from the SLRG (Swiss Life Saving Society) for another dip in the Rhine. Selina told me it is rare that people get in trouble, and if they do it is often because they misjudge their own swimming ability. We took the same route together, only this time we walked back upstream afterwards, drank iced tea from buvettes and ate ice-cream on the warm slabs of concrete that dried our bodies before we plunged back in. Selina explained that the current is usually faster and water level higher than in this hot summer week, so what I had experienced was tame. I spent the afternoon with Selina both of us just in swimwear, not thinking twice about the fact we were walking around the city clad like this. Along the embankment on the Kleinbasel side of the river there are plenty of places to get into and out of the water. Swimming in the Rhine feels like you are in the soul of the city but Basel has plenty else on offer. Its history is fascinating and I found myself walking the same steps with new eyes after an hour\u2019s walking tour with a guide uncovering secrets of the city. I discovered that bathing in Basel isn\u2019t just reserved for the Rhine; more than 200 historic fountains across the city are also popular for cooling off in. The Swim City exhibition at the Swiss Architecture Museum until 29 September is a celebration of bathing culture in cities across the world and a look at how swimming in cities could look in the future. Exhibits include the Thames Bath: a floating river pool on the river in central London and +POOL \u2013 a development that would allow New Yorkers to swim in the Hudson River. If the sweeping river current isn\u2019t for you, river culture can be soaked up in one of two bathing houses that sit on stilts on the riverbank. Constructed in 1898, the large metal-and-wooden structures offer sunloungers, parasols, changing facilities, and steps down to less-lively water under the stilts for around \u00a35 a day. The Rheinbad Breite bathing house sits opposite the swimmers\u2019 beach on the south bank. Sitting in its restaurant, Le Rhine Blue, I loved watching swimmers sweep past beneath the wooden slats at my feet while I ate antipasti and sea bream. I\u2019ve always associated Switzerland with winter travel or suits on business trips but as soon as the temperature allows, Basel is all about bathing, barbecues and buvettes. In this city centre a swimsuit is the typical summer outfit. \u2022 Travel was provided by Switzerland Tourism and Basel Tourism. The Swiss Travel Pass (swisstravelsystem.co.uk) also includes the Swiss museum pass, allowing you free entrance to 500 museums and exhibitions. Prices from \u00a3185 in second class.

      "bodyText": "People who struggle with sleep might be at greater risk of developing cardiovascular problems, research suggests. Scientists have found that people who are genetically predisposed to insomnia have a greater risk of heart failure, stroke and coronary artery disease. Researchers say the study backs previous work that has found links between poor sleep and cardiovascular problems, with the latest study supporting the idea that insomnia could play a role in causing such conditions. \u201cIf that really is the case, then if we can improve or reduce sleep disturbances, that might reduce the risk of stroke,\u201d said Prof Hugh Markus, co-author of the research from the University of Cambridge. The new study relies on previous findings that there are about 250 genetic variants, each of which slightly increases the risk of someone having insomnia. \u201cMost people don\u2019t have all of them, people will have a number of them, a few or many of them,\u201d said Markus. The crucial point is the way the genetic variants are inherited. Whether an individual carries them is random: their presence does not depend on the rest of that person\u2019s genetic makeup or environmental factors, such as where they live, their wealth or how much they exercise.

This is a different approach to previous studies which could only show association, not causation. Writing in the journal Circulation, researchers from the UK and Sweden report how they harnessed this approach by drawing on health and genetic information within a range of large-scale databases. For each cardiovascular condition, data from hundreds of thousands of individuals was examined \u2013 for investigations into heart failure the team used data from almost 400,000 participants in the UK Biobank study alone. While Markus noted it was not yet clear whether improving insomnia would improve cardiovascular health, he said there were interventions that could help those who struggle to sleep, including cognitive behavioural therapy. However, the latest study had limitations including that it only looked at genetic predisposition to insomnia, rather than how much sleep individuals actually managed per night, and that the majority of the data was gathered from people with European ancestry.

Five cameras pick up every move, as they lunge and thrust in front of a pulsating LED screen at the east London studio where they are filming a high-intensity workout class for <a href=\"https://fiit.tv/\" title=\"\">at-home fitness pioneers FIIT.</a></p> <p>The footage will be broadcast via the FIIT app as a live class. Users will be able to join from the comfort of their own homes. If they choose to wear the heart-rate monitor provided, they can compete with other users on a live leaderboard. There are also classes available on demand, for the less competitive.</p> <p>FIIT and the other players in the burgeoning \u201cdigital fitness\u201d industry are all out for a piece of the UK\u2019s \u00a34.9bn fitness industry, which the market-research group Mintel predicts will grow to \u00a35.3bn by 2023. Their aim? To bring the gym to you, in some cases with hi-tech wearables or equipment, or through guided workouts on your phone.</p> <p>Since FIIT launched in April 2018, the app has been downloaded by 150,000 users, who have taken a combined 500,000 classes like this one. \u201cLet\u2019s keep the sweat on the floor,\u201d says the production head Mitra Memarzia from the darkened control room, as Lewis-Carter rocks back on his heels, exhaling deeply.</p> <p>Although the class is only half an hour long, it takes twice as long to record, meaning King and Lewis-Carter \u2013 fitness influencers and personal trainers with 633,000 Instagram followers between them \u2013 look knackered.

On the morning we speak, Allen has completed a half-hour workout dressed only in a sports bra and shorts \u2013 kit she would never have felt comfortable wearing at her former gym, where she witnessed men taking photos of women squatting without their knowledge. (Allen says she complained to the management, who did nothing.)</p> <p>\u201cI feel a lot better for using this app than using the gym,\u201d says Allen. \u201cWhen I went to the gym, I didn\u2019t have a routine, so I wasn\u2019t sure what I was doing. But, with the app, you go up in stages, so you can feel a difference.\u201d The app\u2019s structured, goal-focused workouts help her stick with it; when you complete a goal, confetti cascades down the screen. \u201cHaving goals and targets, and being rewarded for successfully achieving them, is a key component of building habits,\u201d says SWEAT\u2019s chief executive, Tobi Pearce.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What would it take to get me back into the gym? For it to be a lot cheaper.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Another advantage of working out at home is cost. With the exception of premium products such as Peloton (which starts at \u00a31,990 for the bike, plus a monthly membership of \u00a339), most digital fitness products are cheaper than the average monthly gym membership in Europe, which <a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/de/Documents/consumer-business/European%20Health%20and%20Fitness%20Report_2018_extract.pdf\" title=\"\">Deloitte and EuropeActive</a> last year estimated at \u00a340.53; the monthly cost of FIIT is \u00a320, while SWEAT is \u00a315.</p> <p>\u201cWhat would it take to get me back into the gym?\u201d asks Romer Attenborough, a 28-year-old teacher from Kingston upon Thames. \u201cFor it to be a lot cheaper.\u201d Attenborough used to frequent Virgin Active, but felt that the membership \u2013 at the time, \u00a3110 a month \u2013 was too expensive. In 2017, she discovered FitnessBlender, a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiP6wD_tYlYLYh3agzbByWQ\" title=\"\">no-frills</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiP6wD_tYlYLYh3agzbByWQ\" title=\"\"> YouTube workout channel</a>, and never looked back. \u201cIt\u2019s so effective,\u201d she says. \u201cAfter a workout, I\u2019m literally dripping.\u201d</p> <p>It is possible to exercise as effectively on your own at home as you would in a gym under supervision, depending on your own motivation \u2013 but there are risks. Most digital fitness programmes include warm-ups and cool-downs, but it\u2019s possible to overdo it \u2013 and SWEAT\u2019s focus on fat loss (users are encouraged to post photos documenting their progress towards \u201c<a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sweat-kayla-itsines-fitness/id1049234587\" title=\"\">bikini body confidence</a>\u201d) may be triggering for people with eating disorders or obsessive exercise habits.</p> <p>\u201cI was too regimented and hardcore about it,\u201d says 27-year-old New Yorker Elizabeth Megrabyan, who works in advertising. Megrabyan bought the Kayla Itsines pdf (a forerunner to the SWEAT app) in 2016. She would amend the programme to cram in more high-intensity interval training (HIIT). \u201cI was trying to achieve results faster. I think I became too obsessed with the programme \u2013 they show people\u2019s progress pictures and I thought: \u2018I want that.\u2019\u201d Megrabyan ended up in hospital with rhabdomyolysis, a potentially life-threatening illness sometimes caused by extreme muscle strain.</p> <p>The physiotherapist Adam Meakins advises people in general to avoid high-intensity workouts if they are new to exercise. \u201cThe risk with a novice going in and doing HIIT exercises is that you can end up pulling something in your muscular-skeletal system a lot more easily than you would if you were an experienced exerciser whose body has adapted resilience to explosive forces.\u201d That said, he welcomes anything that will get people moving. \u201cThere are always risks associated with any exercise \u2026 the biggest risk factor is not doing any exercise at all.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, gyms are more than just places we work out in \u2013 they are also important social hubs, particularly for self-employed people. I know this first-hand: as a freelance journalist, the only reliable interaction I have is with the trainers in my local gym, which I attend daily.

When I speak to Allen, she is in the middle of a 30-day SWEAT challenge, in which users pledge to work out every day for a month and cheer each other on online.

      "bodyText": "Chessie King whoops, flipping her ponytail out of her face. Her partner, Mathew Lewis-Carter, grunts with the exertion, sweat pouring from his brow. Five cameras pick up every move, as they lunge and thrust in front of a pulsating LED screen at the east London studio where they are filming a high-intensity workout class for at-home fitness pioneers FIIT. The footage will be broadcast via the FIIT app as a live class. Users will be able to join from the comfort of their own homes. If they choose to wear the heart-rate monitor provided, they can compete with other users on a live leaderboard. There are also classes available on demand, for the less competitive. FIIT and the other players in the burgeoning \u201cdigital fitness\u201d industry are all out for a piece of the UK\u2019s \u00a34.9bn fitness industry, which the market-research group Mintel predicts will grow to \u00a35.3bn by 2023. Their aim? To bring the gym to you, in some cases with hi-tech wearables or equipment, or through guided workouts on your phone. Since FIIT launched in April 2018, the app has been downloaded by 150,000 users, who have taken a combined 500,000 classes like this one. \u201cLet\u2019s keep the sweat on the floor,\u201d says the production head Mitra Memarzia from the darkened control room, as Lewis-Carter rocks back on his heels, exhaling deeply. Although the class is only half an hour long, it takes twice as long to record, meaning King and Lewis-Carter \u2013 fitness influencers and personal trainers with 633,000 Instagram followers between them \u2013 look knackered. But in order to get at-home users through the gruelling routine, the trainers have to project the positivity typically associated with children\u2019s-TV presenters. \u201cMaintain that energy even though you\u2019re tired,\u201d cheers King, legs pumping furiously. \u201cWe\u2019re with you!\u201d Later, at home, I try FIIT for myself. I log in via the app, put on the heart-rate monitor, connect the device to my TV, and move the coffee table into my kitchen \u2013 as in many urban homes, space is tight. On the screen, a timer counts down to the 8pm class, led by personal trainers Adrienne Herbert and Alex Crockford. It shows there are 14 other members online. Seeing them congregating in the \u201cdigital lobby\u201d, I feel unaccountably nervous. But there\u2019s no time for that: after a warm-up, we launch straight into a high-intensity class. It wasn\u2019t so long ago that exercising at home was the norm. Jane Fonda defined the genre in the 80s, her tapes introducing women to the joys of aerobic fitness in footless tights. Cindy Crawford followed suit in the 90s, while Davina McCall entered the market more recently. But today\u2019s hi-tech, interactive, at-home workouts are unrecognisable compared with those of the past. Beyond FIIT, the virtual cycling experts Peloton and Zwift lead users through classes on connected stationary bikes at home. Hydrow does the same with rowing machines. A US startup, Mirror, beams classes into your home on to a $1,500 (\u00a31,250) LCD mirror. In the audio space, Aaptiv puts personal trainers in your headphones, while the popular smartphone app SWEAT: Kayla Itsines Fitness bills itself as \u201cthe world\u2019s largest digital gym\u201d, with 35m workouts completed since 2015. One SWEAT fan is Warwick-based Rebecca Allen, a 21-year-old professional dog-sitter. On the morning we speak, Allen has completed a half-hour workout dressed only in a sports bra and shorts \u2013 kit she would never have felt comfortable wearing at her former gym, where she witnessed men taking photos of women squatting without their knowledge. (Allen says she complained to the management, who did nothing.) \u201cI feel a lot better for using this app than using the gym,\u201d says Allen. \u201cWhen I went to the gym, I didn\u2019t have a routine, so I wasn\u2019t sure what I was doing. But, with the app, you go up in stages, so you can feel a difference.\u201d The app\u2019s structured, goal-focused workouts help her stick with it; when you complete a goal, confetti cascades down the screen. \u201cHaving goals and targets, and being rewarded for successfully achieving them, is a key component of building habits,\u201d says SWEAT\u2019s chief executive, Tobi Pearce. Another advantage of working out at home is cost. With the exception of premium products such as Peloton (which starts at \u00a31,990 for the bike, plus a monthly membership of \u00a339), most digital fitness products are cheaper than the average monthly gym membership in Europe, which Deloitte and EuropeActive last year estimated at \u00a340.53; the monthly cost of FIIT is \u00a320, while SWEAT is \u00a315. \u201cWhat would it take to get me back into the gym?\u201d asks Romer Attenborough, a 28-year-old teacher from Kingston upon Thames. \u201cFor it to be a lot cheaper.\u201d Attenborough used to frequent Virgin Active, but felt that the membership \u2013 at the time, \u00a3110 a month \u2013 was too expensive. In 2017, she discovered FitnessBlender, a no-frills YouTube workout channel, and never looked back. \u201cIt\u2019s so effective,\u201d she says. \u201cAfter a workout, I\u2019m literally dripping.\u201d It is possible to exercise as effectively on your own at home as you would in a gym under supervision, depending on your own motivation \u2013 but there are risks. Most digital fitness programmes include warm-ups and cool-downs, but it\u2019s possible to overdo it \u2013 and SWEAT\u2019s focus on fat loss (users are encouraged to post photos documenting their progress towards \u201cbikini body confidence\u201d) may be triggering for people with eating disorders or obsessive exercise habits. \u201cI was too regimented and hardcore about it,\u201d says 27-year-old New Yorker Elizabeth Megrabyan, who works in advertising. Megrabyan bought the Kayla Itsines pdf (a forerunner to the SWEAT app) in 2016. She would amend the programme to cram in more high-intensity interval training (HIIT). \u201cI was trying to achieve results faster. I think I became too obsessed with the programme \u2013 they show people\u2019s progress pictures and I thought: \u2018I want that.\u2019\u201d Megrabyan ended up in hospital with rhabdomyolysis, a potentially life-threatening illness sometimes caused by extreme muscle strain. The physiotherapist Adam Meakins advises people in general to avoid high-intensity workouts if they are new to exercise. \u201cThe risk with a novice going in and doing HIIT exercises is that you can end up pulling something in your muscular-skeletal system a lot more easily than you would if you were an experienced exerciser whose body has adapted resilience to explosive forces.\u201d That said, he welcomes anything that will get people moving. \u201cThere are always risks associated with any exercise \u2026 the biggest risk factor is not doing any exercise at all.\u201d Of course, gyms are more than just places we work out in \u2013 they are also important social hubs, particularly for self-employed people. I know this first-hand: as a freelance journalist, the only reliable interaction I have is with the trainers in my local gym, which I attend daily. Stripping that human contact out of my life would be alienating. Digital fitness apps try to combat this by encouraging users to form communities online: FIIT has a Facebook group, while SWEAT fans congregate on Instagram. When I speak to Allen, she is in the middle of a 30-day SWEAT challenge, in which users pledge to work out every day for a month and cheer each other on online. Allen says she has made friends through the SWEAT community. \u201cYou interact with other people, and they interact with you, and it\u2019s so positive \u2026 it\u2019s lovely. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m doing it alone.\u201d FIIT\u2019s interactive leaderboard approximates the experience of working out in a fitness class. \u201cOther people working out with you gives you that accountability, and makes you work harder,\u201d says its co-founder Sammi Adhami. Does the digital fitness industry want to run gyms out of business? SWEAT\u2019s Pearce laughs awkwardly: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t necessarily say that\u2019s our target.\u201d But it may already be happening. Lauren Ryan of Mintel notes that Peloton\u2019s North American \u201cridership\u201d exceeded that of the boutique spin studio SoulCycle for the first time last year: \u201cThis indicates that digital fitness is already challenging gyms and fitness studios in other parts of the globe.\u201d Still, it is a rare person who is driven enough to work out at home indefinitely, without a trainer shouting at them or classmates encouraging them on. (And there will always be people who require gym equipment.) \u201cThere\u2019s a certain subset of the population who are going to be motivated enough to use this stuff at home,\u201d says John Porcari, a professor of exercise and sport science at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse. \u201cBut do I think it will replace gyms?

      "body": "<p>The central gimmick of new movie Killers Anonymous is an AA-style support group where various underworld assassins come to \u201cshare\u201d. That\u2019s about all it has to bring to this flagging party, other than underlining how utterly divorced the movies\u2019 concept of the \u201chitman\u201d has become from reality. The world is tragically full of gun violence and targeted assassinations, but the perpetrators are rarely cool international assassins who make a clean shot from a rooftop far away, or walk away from explosions without turning round (thus making it painfully obvious that <em>they\u2019re the culprit!).</em> And yet these characters have become a tiresome fixture of modern moviegoing. Someone needs to take them out.</p> <p>Where Killers Anonymous assembles a motley group of recovering assassins (including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/15/gary-oldman-working-class-british-actor-darkest-hour\">Gary Oldman</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jul/13/jessica-alba-la-finest\">Jessica Alba</a>), we might easily form our own circle of killaholics.

One estimate puts his kill count over his three movies at 299, so \u2026 work to do. Joining him could be Mads Mikkelsen from Polar, Helen Mirren from Red, Jason Statham\u2019s \u201cMechanic\u201d, George Clooney\u2019s \u201cAmerican\u201d, Pierce Brosnan\u2019s \u201cMatador\u201d.

We are going to need more chairs. Besson\u2019s filmography mirrors the descent of this stock character so precisely, it could well all be his fault.

      "bodyText": "The central gimmick of new movie Killers Anonymous is an AA-style support group where various underworld assassins come to \u201cshare\u201d. That\u2019s about all it has to bring to this flagging party, other than underlining how utterly divorced the movies\u2019 concept of the \u201chitman\u201d has become from reality. The world is tragically full of gun violence and targeted assassinations, but the perpetrators are rarely cool international assassins who make a clean shot from a rooftop far away, or walk away from explosions without turning round (thus making it painfully obvious that they\u2019re the culprit!). And yet these characters have become a tiresome fixture of modern moviegoing. Someone needs to take them out. Where Killers Anonymous assembles a motley group of recovering assassins (including Gary Oldman and Jessica Alba), we might easily form our own circle of killaholics. Pulling up the first chair would be Keanu Reeves\u2019s badass assassin John Wick. One estimate puts his kill count over his three movies at 299, so \u2026 work to do. Joining him could be Mads Mikkelsen from Polar, Helen Mirren from Red, Jason Statham\u2019s \u201cMechanic\u201d, George Clooney\u2019s \u201cAmerican\u201d, Pierce Brosnan\u2019s \u201cMatador\u201d. The queue stretches round the block. Here\u2019s Killing Eve\u2019s Villanelle. Here\u2019s Bill Hader\u2019s Barry. Samuel L Jackson from The Hitman\u2019s Bodyguard sends his apologies. He can\u2019t make it because he\u2019s filming the sequel. Oh God, now Luc Besson has turned up. We are going to need more chairs. Besson\u2019s filmography mirrors the descent of this stock character so precisely, it could well all be his fault. Each of Besson\u2019s killers has been an inferior copy of the last, starting back with Nikita and Leon in the 90s, and regressing, via remakes and TV adaptations, through Timothy Olyphant\u2019s Hitman, Zoe Saldana\u2019s Colombiana, and \u2013 just a few weeks ago \u2013 Sasha Luss\u2019s Anna, whose pointless model/assassin exploits unfolded with algorithmic predictability. More often than not, the only way to play these killers now is for laughs. And for sympathy. True, their day job is making people like us dead, but they have feelings, too. And they adopt orphans.

He had never voted. He paid more attention to video games than to news.

He had long discussions with Foster, then his teammate on the Dolphins, who encouraged Stills to read and educate himself.</p> <p>Stills started with The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness, a critique of systemic racial discrimination in the justice system, then moved on to the works of African-American literary giant James Baldwin and civil rights leader John Lewis.</p> <p>Stills shared what he was learning with family and friends. He organized his community service road trip.

To help people who don\u2019t have a voice be heard.</p> <p>\u201cPeople definitely ask me to stick to sports, and I totally understand where they are coming from. You want to be entertained, and get away from all the things that are happening.

Don\u2019t you think they want to live their lives and be entertained like something never happened to them? I still catch passes and touchdowns and the games still go on \u2013 but these things are happening to human beings.

Maybe in five years, the NFL hires him for social activism. I think at some point there will be some kind of detente that does not involve him playing.\u201d</p> <p>Ali, Smith and Carlos were once reviled and shunned. Today, all three are widely admired \u2013 both for taking conscientious stands and enduring the price of doing so. Ali lit the Olympic flame at the 1996 Atlanta Games, while Smith and Carlos have been <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/olympic-black-power-statue\">honored with a fist-raising statue</a> at San Jose State University, their alma mater.</p> <p>Moore said that Kaepernick will someday enjoy similar public regard.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you actually risk your livelihood in sports to stand up for social justice, the comparison is always to Ali, Smith, and Carlos,\u201d Moore said. \u201cBut in the future, the question will be, \u2018how does this compare to [Kaepernick]?\u2019 I think that is his legacy. In the end, people will embrace him. He will be loved.\u201d</p> <p>For now, Kaepernick continues to work, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/31/sport/colin-kaepernick-million-dollar-donation-pledge-anthem-nfl-trnd/index.html\">donating money</a> to community charities and staging his <a href=\"https://knowyourrightscamp.com/about/\">Know Your Rights camps</a> for young people. He also continues to wait.

      "bodyText": "Over the last three years, Kenny Stills has not stuck to sports. Instead, the Miami Dolphins receiver has kneeled during the national anthem before games to protest racial injustice. Taken an off-season road trip through the American south to visit community activists and civil rights movement landmarks. Publicly called out his own boss, Dolphins owner Stephen Ross, for the seeming incongruity of founding a nonprofit dedicated to racial equality \u2013 while also hosting a recent reelection fundraiser for US president Donald Trump. The timeframe of his activism, Stills said, is hardly coincidental. \u201cColin Kaepernick has played a really big part in helping open my eyes,\u201d Stills said. \u201cHe\u2019s influenced me and everything I\u2019ve done from the time I first took a knee on September 11, 2016, to now.\u201d Last week marked three years since Kaepernick first brought attention to police brutality against people of color by sitting during the national anthem, a protest that ultimately led to the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback\u2019s athletic exile. Since then, Kaepernick has been awarded Amnesty International\u2019s top honor. He has drawn Trump\u2019s ire. He has inspired athletes like Stills, and been labeled a \u201ctraitor\u201d by a NFL executive. He has served as the face of a multimillion-dollar Nike marketing campaign, and donated $1m to community charities. He has accused league owners of colluding to keep him out of football, and kept himself ready to play again. A persona non grata in his sport, Kaepernick stands as a symbol of conscience outside of it. Yet for the most part, the quarterback has maintained radio silence, choosing to communicate with the media and public by sharing other people\u2019s words on Twitter. As such, it\u2019s difficult to know exactly how Kaepernick views his time in the NFL wilderness. Nevertheless, it\u2019s worth asking: after three years, what has he accomplished \u2013 and at what cost? \u201cColin is a pioneer,\u201d said Andrew Brandt, a former NFL front office executive who now writes about the league and is a sports law professor at Villanova University. \u201cHe is a beacon for other athletes. We can all talk about his impact. But he\u2019s also not getting to do what he wants, which is play football. He has been ostracized.\u201d For now, at least, the answers depend on where you look. The outcast When Kaepernick first began protesting during the 2016 NFL preseason, he understood his actions would be controversial \u2013 and that he was taking a career risk. \u201cI am not looking for approval,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cIf they take football away, my endorsements from me, I know that I stood up for what is right.\u201d Before Kaepernick sat, athletes ranging from WNBA players to the five members of the Los Angeles Rams to the NBA\u2019s LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, and Dwayne Wade had taken public stances against the racial injustice and police violence that spurred the formation of the Black Lives Matter movement and protests in places such as Ferguson, Missouri. However, Kaepernick\u2019s actions received far more attention, transforming him into a cultural and political flashpoint. His attempt to highlight what he called the \u201coppress[ion] of black people and people of color\u201d quickly was lost amid heated debates about patriotism, sufficiently appreciating America\u2019s military, and the appropriateness of mixing sports and politics. After meeting with former NFL player and US Army veteran Nate Boyer, Kaepernick switched from sitting during the anthem to kneeling, the better to \u201cshow more respect for the men and women who fight for the country.\u201d Nevertheless, then-Republican presidential nominee Trump said that Kaepernick should \u201cfind a country that works better for him\u201d. Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg labeled the quarterback\u2019s actions \u201cdumb and disrespectful\u201d. Meanwhile, conservative talk radio host Rush Limbaugh echoed a critique made by some football fans, lamenting that Kaepernick\u2019s protests reflected the \u201cpoliticization of everything\u201d. Within the NFL, reaction to Kaepernick was mixed \u2013 and largely split along racial and labor-management lines. Then-49ers safety Eric Reid and other teammates joined the quarterback\u2019s protests. Over the course of the season, African-American players for other teams followed suit, including Malcom Jenkins, Arian Foster, and Stills. By contrast, seven anonymous league executives told journalist Mike Freeman that they wouldn\u2019t sign Kaepernick to their teams. One called the quarterback a \u201ctraitor\u201d. Another stated, \u201che has no respect for our country. Fuck that guy.\u201d \u201cIn my career,\u201d a NFL general manger told Freeman, \u201cI have never seen a guy so hated by front office guys as Kaepernick.\u201d Kaepernick entered free agency in the 2017 offseason as an accomplished performer at a position of perpetual league need. Over six seasons, the quarterback had thrown for 12,271 yards and 72 touchdown passes with just 30 interceptions; rushed for 2,300 yards and 13 touchdowns; and led the 49ers to a Super Bowl appearance. He also had appeared on the cover of the popular Madden NFL video game. Despite that resume, Kaepernick went unsigned by the NFL\u2019s 32 teams. In June 2017, league commissioner Roger Goodell suggested that his absence was purely the result of \u201cfootball decisions\u201d. As NFL teams subsequently hired a series of less-accomplished signal callers \u2013 including Zac Dysert, Josh Woodrum, and the immortal Matt Simms \u2013 Goodell\u2019s assertion appeared increasingly dubious. In October 2017, Kaepernick filed a grievance against the league, accusing team owners of colluding to keep him from being signed because of his \u201cadvocacy for equality and social justice\u201d. Last February, Kaepernick and the NFL reached a confidential settlement of the case reportedly worth less than $10m. A few weeks earlier, an anonymous survey of 85 NFL defensive players by the Athletic found that 81 believed he deserved a roster spot in the league. Today, however, Kaepernick remains a quarterback without a team \u2013 a former Pro Bowl performer whose most recent touchdown pass to a NFL player came in a March charity game. \u201cYou\u2019ve had people who have gotten DUIs coming back to the league,\u201d said Lou Moore, a history professor at Grand Valley State University and author of We Will Win the Day: The Civil Rights Movement, the Black Athlete, and the Quest for Equality. \u201cMichael Vick came back to the league after dogfighting. \u201cThe way the NFL works is, if you are good and can help a team, we will bring you in. Kaepernick is clearly good enough. And he didn\u2019t come back. That says a lot about what the teams think about him. And the fact that he had to know that [protesting] could cost him his career \u2013 and he still did it \u2013 says a lot about him.\u201d The beacon Before Kaepernick\u2019s first protest, Stills said, he wasn\u2019t particularly interested in politics.

Stills shared what he was learning with family and friends. He organized his community service road trip. He began protesting during the anthem and also working with South Florida police, children, and community groups. \u201c[Kaepernick] showed me that as athletes, there is something we can do,\u201d Stills said. \u201cWe can use our platform to inform other people what needs to change.

It shouldn\u2019t be hard to have a little bit of empathy.\u201d Stills isn\u2019t alone. Soccer star Megan Rapinoe took a knee during the anthem in 2016 \u2013 and since has been anything but shy in expressing her disapproval of Trump. College and high school athletes have staged anthem protests. So have American hammer thrower Gwen Berry and fencer Race Imboden, who this month protested social injustice and Trump by raising a fist and taking a knee, respectively, on the medals stand at the Pan American Games. The Players Coalition, a group of NFL players, leveraged anthem protests into a $89m social justice partnership with the league. Moore said that Kaepernick has helped revive and galvanize a tradition of athlete activism that peaked in the 1960s when Muhammad Ali refused to fight in the Vietnam War and American track athletes John Carlos and Tommie Smith gave black power salutes on the podium at the 1968 Summer Olympics. That tradition largely went dormant in the 1980s and 1990s \u2013 in part because Ali, Carlos and Smith lost work and endorsement opportunities for their actions, and in part because many athletes followed the smiling, stick-to-sports examples of superstar pitchmen OJ Simpson and Michael Jordan, who embodied an anodyne ethos reflected in Jordan\u2019s (possibly apocryphal) proclamation that \u201cRepublicans buy sneakers, too\u201d.

And no one disputes that he is a top 100 quarterback. I think for teams, it just becomes: \u2018Is he worth the drama?\u2019 \u201cBut time heals all wounds. Maybe in five years, the NFL hires him for social activism. I think at some point there will be some kind of detente that does not involve him playing.\u201d Ali, Smith and Carlos were once reviled and shunned. Today, all three are widely admired \u2013 both for taking conscientious stands and enduring the price of doing so. Ali lit the Olympic flame at the 1996 Atlanta Games, while Smith and Carlos have been honored with a fist-raising statue at San Jose State University, their alma mater. Moore said that Kaepernick will someday enjoy similar public regard. \u201cWhen you actually risk your livelihood in sports to stand up for social justice, the comparison is always to Ali, Smith, and Carlos,\u201d Moore said. \u201cBut in the future, the question will be, \u2018how does this compare to [Kaepernick]?\u2019 I think that is his legacy. In the end, people will embrace him. He will be loved.\u201d For now, Kaepernick continues to work, donating money to community charities and staging his Know Your Rights camps for young people. He also continues to wait. Last week, the NFL announced that Jay Z \u2013 who previously had expressed public support for the quarterback \u2013 would co-produce upcoming Super Bowl halftime shows and help promote the league\u2019s social justice projects. At a press conference, however, the headlining music mogul repeatedly was asked about one man. \u201cEveryone\u2019s saying, \u2018How are you going forward if Kaep doesn\u2019t have a job?\u2019\u201d Jay Z said. \u201cThis was not about him having a job.\u201d That much rang false, and in a larger sense true, a reminder of everything Kaepernick has lost and won.",

That may have something to do with the promotion of the former under-23s coach Freddie Ljungberg to become the Spaniard\u2019s assistant, with Willock particularly impressive alongside Matteo Guendouzi in midfield. The 19-year-old played in a more advanced role in the opening day win over Newcastle and shows how Emery is tapping into the former Sweden midfielder\u2019s knowledge bank since he stepped up in the summer. \u201c[Ljungberg] worked last year with the under-23s and we were very close, speaking about the young players,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect and he helps me a lot.

He made a fine first appearance for Eddie Howe\u2019s side during Saturday\u2019s win at Aston Villa. Beyond getting lucky when his long-range shot deflected into the net for what proved the winning goal, Wilson was fast and inventive in possession. Playing for Bournemouth is a step up after doing well on loan at Derby last season. If he continues performing like this he will be ready to make another step up when he goes back to Liverpool next season. \u201cWe\u2019re very grateful that [Liverpool] trusted us with Harry for the next stage of his learning and development to try to play in the Premier League,\u201d said Howe. \u201cHe\u2019s got unique qualities that will serve him well.\u201d <strong>Paul Doyle</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/17/aston-villa-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Match report: Aston Villa 1-2 Bournemouth</a></em></p> \n<h2>3) Trossard key to Potter\u2019s bid for freedom</h2> \n<p>During Brighton\u2019s first two seasons of Premier League football, their solidity came at the cost of invention. The players Chris Hughton hoped could provide a spark from the wing, Anthony Knockaert and Jos\u00e9 Izquierdo, never did on a consistent basis, the former now loaned to Fulham and the Colombian missing the start of the season after a knee operation. Graham Potter\u2019s overhauling of the team\u2019s style offers greater freedom and involvement for forward players. The signs from Leandro Trossard \u2013 the debutant playing off the left of an attacking trident against West Ham \u2013 were more than promising. Before his volleyed equaliser, executed sublimely, he had a goal chalked off when VAR ruled Dan Burn offside.

Chelsea may have dazzled through the opening periods of the draw with Leicester but their best display arguably came in Istanbul when the 4-2-3-1 Lampard had hoped to implement was tweaked for something more akin to a 4-3-3 with Jorginho as its central anchor. N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 had operated to the right in a role similar to that inflicted on him by Maurizio Sarri, but still thrived. At times against Leicester, who were dominant after the interval, Chelsea yearned for proper control, with Jorginho and Kant\u00e9 labouring after the exertions in midweek and Mateo Kovacic still lacking dynamism.

Chelsea under \u201cyoung Frank\u201d, as Rodgers referred to his opposite number in a pre-match radio interview, had started dangerously against both Manchester United and Liverpool only to struggle once the opposition adapted. Just as Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r and J\u00fcrgen Klopp threw Lampard\u2019s Chelsea off their flow, so did a Rodgers switch.

They were well beaten by a classy Norwich side who set about the Magpies just as they did so many Championship teams last year. Steve Bruce bemoaned his team\u2019s lack of work off the ball and called them in for training on Sunday to stop it happening again. But there is a view that says his team could not actually have done much better. Their tactics were simply to contain the promoted side and rob the ball at moments of maximum vulnerability. This basic approach created two good opportunities at 0-0 only for first Emil Krafth then Joelinton to fluff their lines. At the same time the strategy hardly screamed of confidence in the players at Bruce\u2019s disposal. Krafth and Joelinton have just arrived on Tyneside. The \u00a340m forward, in particular, will have to improve if Newcastle are to keep clear of trouble. <strong>Paul MacInnes</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/17/norwich-newcastle-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Match report: Norwich 3-1 Newcastle</a></em></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/18/tottenham-mauricio-pochettino-transfer-window-christian-eriksen\">Tottenham\u2019s Mauricio Pochettino wants transfer window to stay open longer</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>9) Innovative Wilder showing appearances can be deceptive</h2> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/18/ole-gunnar-solskjaer-paul-pogba-manchester-united\">Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r adamant Paul Pogba will stay at Manchester United</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Newly promoted teams are invariably adrenaline high in August, often clocking up their best run of results during the weeks before the clocks go back and winter\u2019s grim realities begin to bite. Over-hyping can be a danger but there should also be a recognition that Sheffield United\u2019s Chris Wilder is not a manager to be patronised. Instead Wilder serves as a warning that assumptions are dangerous and appearances can be deceptive. True, he sounds and looks a little rough around the edges but in recent seasons he has arguably been the most innovative coach in England. Imagine the excitement if Pep Guardiola or J\u00fcrgen Klopp had been credited with inventing overlapping centre-halves. Wilder may not be smooth enough for some, may seem too parochial for others but snobbery should be suspended. <strong>Louise Taylor</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/18/sheffield-united-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Match report: Sheffield United 1-0 Crystal Palace</a></em></p> \n<h2>10) Valery and Hasenh\u00fcttl give Southampton reasons for cheer</h2> \n<p>Another game, another defeat for Southampton but all associated with the team should take encouragement from how they performed against Liverpool. The hosts more than matched their opponents during the first half and, while somewhat overwhelmed after the interval, they stayed in the contest and ultimately came within a firmer Danny Ings touch of snatching a draw. What generally impressed about Southampton\u2019s display was their balance and organisation within a 3-5-2 formation. Everybody looked comfortable in their respective positions and there is a definite gameplan: stay compact, press at the right times and stretch the play whenever possible. In that regard Yan Valery looks as if he could be a particularly potent weapon for Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s side. The 20-year-old was a consistently threatening presence on the right wing and it was from his excellent cross that Southampton could have, and should have, equalised. <strong>Sachin Nakrani</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/17/southampton-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Match report: Southampton 1-2 Liverpool</a></em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"aa8301cf-b9b4-4ff2-b8fe-22a30b2665b7\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kj2sk-05rQ0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

They were well beaten by a classy Norwich side who set about the Magpies just as they did so many Championship teams last year. Steve Bruce bemoaned his team\u2019s lack of work off the ball and called them in for training on Sunday to stop it happening again. But there is a view that says his team could not actually have done much better. Their tactics were simply to contain the promoted side and rob the ball at moments of maximum vulnerability. This basic approach created two good opportunities at 0-0 only for first Emil Krafth then Joelinton to fluff their lines. At the same time the strategy hardly screamed of confidence in the players at Bruce\u2019s disposal. Krafth and Joelinton have just arrived on Tyneside. The \u00a340m forward, in particular, will have to improve if Newcastle are to keep clear of trouble. Paul MacInnes \u2022 Match report: Norwich 3-1 Newcastle 9) Innovative Wilder showing appearances can be deceptive Newly promoted teams are invariably adrenaline high in August, often clocking up their best run of results during the weeks before the clocks go back and winter\u2019s grim realities begin to bite. Over-hyping can be a danger but there should also be a recognition that Sheffield United\u2019s Chris Wilder is not a manager to be patronised. Instead Wilder serves as a warning that assumptions are dangerous and appearances can be deceptive. True, he sounds and looks a little rough around the edges but in recent seasons he has arguably been the most innovative coach in England. Imagine the excitement if Pep Guardiola or J\u00fcrgen Klopp had been credited with inventing overlapping centre-halves. Wilder may not be smooth enough for some, may seem too parochial for others but snobbery should be suspended. Louise Taylor \u2022 Match report: Sheffield United 1-0 Crystal Palace 10) Valery and Hasenh\u00fcttl give Southampton reasons for cheer Another game, another defeat for Southampton but all associated with the team should take encouragement from how they performed against Liverpool. The hosts more than matched their opponents during the first half and, while somewhat overwhelmed after the interval, they stayed in the contest and ultimately came within a firmer Danny Ings touch of snatching a draw. What generally impressed about Southampton\u2019s display was their balance and organisation within a 3-5-2 formation. Everybody looked comfortable in their respective positions and there is a definite gameplan: stay compact, press at the right times and stretch the play whenever possible. In that regard Yan Valery looks as if he could be a particularly potent weapon for Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s side. The 20-year-old was a consistently threatening presence on the right wing and it was from his excellent cross that Southampton could have, and should have, equalised.

China controls another part in the east.<br></p>\n    <p>India and Pakistan have gone to war a further two times over Kashmir, most recently in 1999. Artillery, mortar and small arms fire are still frequently exchanged.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How did the dispute start?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>After the partition of colonial India in 1947, small, semi-autonomous \u2018princely states\u2019 across the subcontinent were being folded into India or Pakistan. The ruler of Kashmir dithered over which to join until tribal fighters entered from Pakistan intent on taking the region for Islamabad.</p>\n    <p>Kashmir asked Delhi for assistance, signing a treaty of accession in exchange for the intervention of Indian troops, who fought the Pakistanis to the modern-day line of control.</p>\n    <p>In 1948, the UN security council called for a referendum in Kashmir to determine which country the region would join or whether it would become an independent state. The referendum has never been held.</p>\n    <p>In its 1950 constitution, India granted Kashmir a large measure of independence. But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was Kashmir\u2019s special status?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Kashmir\u2019s special status, given in exchange for joining the Indian union, had been in place since 14 May 1954. Under article 370, the state was given a separate constitution, a flag, and autonomy over all matters except for foreign affairs and defence.&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p>An additional provision, article 35a, prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believed this was crucial to protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority state and its way of life.</p>\n    <p>The ruling Bharatiya Janata party repeatedly promised to scrap such rules, a long-term demand of its Hindu nationalist support base. But analysts warned doing so would almost certainly ignite unrest.</p>\n    <p>On Wednesday 31 October 2019, the government formally revoked Kashmir\u2019s special status. The government argued that the provision had&nbsp; only ever intended to be temporary and that scrapping it would boost investment in Kashmir. Critics, however, said the move would escalate tensions with Pakistan \u2013 which quickly called India\u2019s actions illegal \u2013 and fuel resentment in Kashmir, where there is an insurgency against Indian rule.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do the militants want?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades. Indian soldiers and Pakistan-backed guerrillas fought a war rife with accusations of torture, forced disappearances and extra-judicial killing.<br></p>\n    <p>Until 2004, the militancy was made up largely of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. Since then, especially after protests were quashed with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/08/india-crackdown-in-kashmir-is-this-worlds-first-mass-blinding\">extreme force</a>&nbsp;in 2016, locals have made up a growing share of the anti-India fighters.</p>\n    <p>For Indians, control of Kashmir \u2013 part of the country\u2019s only Muslim-majority state \u2013 has been proof of its commitment to religious pluralism. For Pakistan, a state founded as a homeland for south Asian Muslims, it is the last occupied home of its co-religionists. <br><b><br>Michael Safi and Rebecca Ratcliffe</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Two days ago he heard loud bangs of teargas shells and then bursts of aerial fire. \u201cIt continued for several hours.

The tanker, which has been caught in a standoff between Tehran and the west, was sailing for Greece on Monday, shipping data showed, hours after the British territory rejected a US request to detain the vessel further. MarineTraffic reported its destination as the Peloponnesian city of Kalamata. Asked whether the US might renew its seizure request after the tanker sailed from Gibraltar, an Iranian foreign ministry said: \u201cSuch an action \u2026 would endanger shipping safety in open seas. We have issued a warning through official channels, especially the Swiss embassy.\u201d Switzerland represents US interests in Iran. Tehran has no official diplomatic relations with Washington. The ship, formerly known as the Grace 1 but renamed by Iran as the Adrian Darya 1, is carrying 2.1m barrels of oil, a cargo is worth an estimated \u00a3115m. Royal Marines seized the vessel off Gibraltar on 4 July, saying it was carrying oil bound for Syria in breach of EU sanctions. That prompted Iran to seize the British-flagged tanker Stena Impero in the Gulf in retaliation a fortnight later, sparking a diplomatic crisis between the two countries. Britain responded by sending a second warship to the Gulf to offer greater protection to merchant shipping. Iran has denied that its tanker was heading for Syria, and the vessel\u2019s detention appeared to ended last week after Iran gave a written commitment to Gibraltar that it would not sail to Syria or anywhere else covered by EU sanctions. There was fresh legal uncertainty on Friday, however, when a federal court in Washington issued a warrant for the seizure of the supertanker, the oil it carries and nearly $1m (\u00a3820,000), saying there had been a breach of US sanctions against Iran. The US claims the tanker is controlled through a network of front companies by Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard, which Washington designates as terrorist organisation and is one of the targets of its sanctions. Gibraltar said on Sunday it was unable to comply with the US request because it was bound by EU law. \u201cThe EU sanctions regime on Iran is fundamentally different to that the US,\u201d Gibraltar said. The authorities also said the Revolutionary Guard was not designated a terrorist organisation under EU, UK or Gibraltar law. Without the territory agreeing to the US request, there were no immediate legal obstacles left to the supertanker setting sail. The Astralship shipping agency in Gibraltar, which has been hired to handle paperwork and arrange logistics for the Adrian Darya 1, told the Associated Press that a new crew of Indian and Ukrainian nationals were replacing the sailors on board.

      "bodyText": "New Zealand has accused the Australian government of likely making \u201ca bad situation worse\u201d by proposing a massive extension of visa cancellation powers and blamed Australia for the rate of reoffending by criminals deported to New Zealand. Appearing before the Senate legal and constitutional affairs committee on Monday, New Zealand high commissioner Annette King joined calls from the Law Council, the Human Rights Commission and refugee groups urging the parliament not to extend the powers. The Morrison government has reintroduced a bill to change the Migration Act to provide grounds for visa cancellation or refusal where a non-citizen has been convicted of a serious crime punishable by two years imprisonment, even if a jail term is not imposed. Migration experts have warned the law could result in the number of people who fail the character test automatically expanded \u201cby a factor of five\u201d, with visa-holders then vulnerable to a discretion of the home affairs minister or delegate who can deport them. King told the committee New Zealand has been \u201cdisproportionately affected\u201d since law changes in 2014 revoked the rule that Australia will not deport people who have been residents for 10 years or more. King complained of a \u201clack of reciprocity of treatment\u201d, with Australians only accounting for 1% of deportations from New Zealand while New Zealanders account for more than 50% of deportations from Australia. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Widening the net of those to be deported to include anyone who has committed an offence punishable by two or more years of prison would \u201cgreatly widen the net of New Zealanders vulnerable to cancellations and deportations\u201d, she said. King said New Zealand accepts responsibility for criminal behaviour of people resident in New Zealand, submitting that Australia should take responsibility \u201cfor those who are the product of Australia\u201d. Under questioning from Coalition senators, King conceded that the rate of reoffending of deported New Zealanders is 44% but noted that many of those people had lived in Australia for 20 years or more, while many had left New Zealand as children and were educated in Australia. \u201cThey\u2019ve come back to New Zealand with very few connections. They don\u2019t have friends, they don\u2019t have jobs \u2026 the glue that holds societies together.\u201d King noted that governments of both political complexion under John Key and Jacinda Ardern had criticised Australia\u2019s policy. She called for a return of the 10-year rule, still respected by New Zealand, or \u201cspecial consideration\u201d exempting New Zealanders if the bill is passed. Law Council witnesses told the committee the bill would capture low levels of offending, such as threats with no actual physical violence or possessing weapons like screwdrivers, rocks or sticks, with people caught even if they are not imprisoned but rather sentenced to community service or given fines. The Law Council\u2019s David Prince said it was \u201cmeaningless\u201d to argue that community standards or safety justify the bill, noting that \u201cnot all criminality is the same\u201d and warning that visa-holders will simply refuse to plead guilty to offences if to do so would trigger deportation. The Australian human rights commissioner Ed Santow warned the bill \u201cdoesn\u2019t pay due regard\u201d to the risk posed by an individual. Santow said he could not identify how current provisions are inadequate and noted that the joint standing committee on migration had said they are operating well and protecting the Australian community. Labor has indicated it will oppose the changes, but is waiting for the final report from the Senate standing committee on legal and constitutional affairs, which reports back to parliament on the changes on 13 September.",

      "body": "<p>When the Tate contacted Olafur Eliasson to suggest the gallery stage a retrospective of his work, the artist\u2019s response was somewhat out of the ordinary. He loved the idea of the show: Tate Modern will always have a place in his heart, for it was in 2003 in its Turbine Hall that he staged the installation for which he\u2019ll probably now always be best known \u2013 the Weather Project. (Eliasson, you\u2019ll remember, somehow induced a giant sun to rise inside that vast and ordinarily sepulchral space.) But why would he want to limit himself only to his art? \u201cI told them I wanted to do the restaurant as well,\u201d he says. How did that go down? \u201cWell, they have two million visitors, so for me to want to tweak their restaurant \u2026\u201d He smiles at his temerity. \u201cBut they were very good about it. \u2018Oh, that\u2019s great,\u2019 they said.\u201d</p> <p>At Eliasson\u2019s studio in Berlin, food is integral to his practice. Since 2005, its top-floor kitchen has prepared and served organic, vegetarian meals to be shared each day by all those who work there (about 80 people). \u201cEating together gives us a space in which we can have conversations,\u201d he tells me, when we meet at the Tate\u2019s temporary <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/olafur-eliasson/artist-set-menu-olafur-eliasson-real-life\" title=\"\">Studio Olafur Eliasson Kitchen</a> for lunch on the day the retrospective finally opens. \u201cWe like to say that when we eat we have the \u2018why\u2019 discussions, and when we\u2019re working, we have the \u2018how\u2019 discussions. As my studio has become bigger, it has also become necessary to make sure there is communication: people might work on the same project, but they might not talk together during the day.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My parents would give me a can of baked beans, and on a good day I would get a sausage on the side</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But his thinking goes wider on this. Institutions of all kinds, he believes, need to consider community and how best it might be fostered. The pioneering Californian chef Alice Waters, who wrote the foreword to his studio\u2019s 2013 cookbook, is a friend. \u201cAs she tells me, in the US, more than 80% of families don\u2019t even eat together once a week. This is why institutions need to introduce eating spaces, as a social space.\u201d He gestures at the long table that now bisects Tate Modern\u2019s ground floor restaurant. \u201cThis table is just like the one we have in our studio, and when we were running the test kitchen, we often saw guests talking to people they didn\u2019t know. We don\u2019t expect people to become close friends and marry or anything, but there is a desire and a need to connect, I think.\u201d</p> <p>Eliasson\u2019s plan for the restaurant at Tate was ambitious. Not only would his studio help to devise the menu (Tate\u2019s chef, Jon Atashroo, came out to Berlin to see its kitchen in full flight), he also wanted it, like so much of his art, to speak to the state of the planet and thus to be as sustainable as possible. \u201cWe wanted to halve its carbon footprint,\u201d he says, peering at a sheet on which some numbers are printed. \u201cOne third of all CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the world are food related. In Berlin, we try not to use any packaging. So at Tate we went from everything being bottled to everything being on tap. Organic salad tastes a lot better, but it\u2019s about 20% more expensive than non-organic salad, and sometimes 50%, depending on the season. We spoke to Tate. What will this mean for your profitability, we asked. But they agreed to it anyway.\u201d</p> <p>The restaurant offers only a <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/visit/tate-modern/studio-olafur-eliasson-kitchen-terrace-bar\" title=\"\">set menu</a> \u2013 four dishes for \u00a316.95 \u2013 and at about this point, the first plates arrive: sourdough accompanied by a spiced red pepper and tomato dip, a bowl of hummus with cumin and some labneh, the Middle Eastern soft cheese. \u201cThe labneh is a replacement for butter,\u201d says Eliasson. \u201cAgain, because of its carbon footprint, which is lower.\u201d He scoops away at the pepper dip. \u201cI prefer it a bit spicier than this,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I was voted down on that yesterday.\u201d A selection of rather lovely stoneware bowls now cover our table for two. \u201cI\u2019m not saying this is home cooking. But it\u2019s something that you could try at home - and this produces 52% less CO<sub>2</sub> than the average home-cooked meal.\u201d</p> <p>Eliasson was born in Copenhagen in 1967, the city to which his parents had emigrated from Iceland in search of work, his father as a cook, his mother as a dressmaker. When he was four, however, his parents separated and his father returned to Iceland. \u201cHe was a cook on a fishing boat,\u201d says Eliasson. \u201cNormally, we would have fish: he would bring it back from the ship. But they weren\u2019t very resourceful my parents, not in those days. They would give me a can of baked beans \u2026 well, they would throw it into boiling water \u2013 this is so unfair to my parents! \u2013 and on a good day, I would get a sausage on the side. Still, what my father did say was, \u2018Why am I on a fishing boat for five weeks at a time and filling up the freezer with pork and chicken?\u2019 The fish all went straight to Canada, you see. So he started cooking it. First, he tried deep frying, and the crew liked it, and he ended up serving ceviche.\u201d</p> <p>Eliasson didn\u2019t grow up to be much of a cook himself, though his younger half-sister, Victoria Eliasdottir is an acclaimed chef. But he loves to eat. What did he live on as a student? \u201cI knew how to make chilli, which you could keep in the fridge for a few days. I remember I once brought a frozen chicken into the art school that I intended to cook that night, and then I forgot all about it. After a week, everyone started to complain about the stink, a smell that was coming from suspiciously close to my seat. When I found it, it was almost inflated. I wondered how to sneak it out without anyone noticing. After that, I didn\u2019t eat chicken for a long time.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d2da488a7ae765a912ee60ea9cc6dd428c847b9b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2da488a7ae765a912ee60ea9cc6dd428c847b9b/0_625_3744_4680/800.jpg\" alt=\"Lunch With Olafur Eliasson at the Tate Modern terrace bar, for OFM, London, 10/07/2019.

We read of Old Ramallah, of the city\u2019s unique atmosphere, its characters and its gardens, the way Shehadeh\u2019s (Christian) family came to Ramallah while he was still a small child, exiled from glamorous Jaffa during the Naqba \u2013 the 1948 expulsion of Palestinians from what was to become Israel. We read of the murder of Shehadeh\u2019s father by a thug who, as a collaborator, was not pursued by the Israeli police.

Books are shaped by the context in which they\u2019re written, and both distance and disappointment cast well-known stories in new light.

In the past 25 years a dozen people have been prosecuted under the NSW Crimes Act for abortion offences. Four of those were found guilty and sentenced.

Abortion has been a criminal offence in New South Wales since 1900, and unlawfully procuring an abortion is punishable by up to 10 years' imprisonment. Doctors are able to conduct abortions if they believe the pregnancy is a risk to a woman\u2019s physical or mental health, and a common law precedent set in 1971 means social and economic factors may also be taken into consideration. Laws before the NSW parliament would make abortion legal on request up to 22 weeks, and with the approval of two doctors beyond that.</p>\n    <p><b>Queensland</b><br>The NSW legislation is based off the bill that passed in Queensland last year. Abortion is legal until 22 weeks gestation, and thereafter with the approval of two doctors.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Victoria</b><br>Legal to 24 weeks and then after 24 weeks with two doctors\u2019 approval.</p>\n    <p><b>ACT</b><br>Legal. Until last year, only a registered medical practitioner could carry out the procedure in an approved facility. However a change to ACT law last year now allows general practitioners to prescribe abortion drugs such as MS\u20112 Step.</p>\n    <p><b>South Australia</b><br>Legal up to 28 weeks but only if two doctors agree that a woman\u2019s physical and/or mental health is endangered by pregnancy, or for serious foetal abnormality. Unlawful abortion remains a crime. Terminations must be performed in a \"prescribed hospital\".</p>\n    <p><b>Western Australia</b><br>Legal up to 20 weeks but women must be given the opportunity to participate in counselling before a termination can be performed. Teenage girls under 16 require a parent to be informed. After 20 weeks, terminations become much more difficult to access. A woman must receive approval from two doctors from a statutory panel of six who agree the woman, or her foetus, has a \"severe medical condition\" that justifies the procedure.<br></p>\n    <p><b>Tasmania</b><br>Lawful on request up to 16 weeks, and beyond that point with the agreement of two doctors.<br></p>\n    <p><b>Northern Territory</b><br>Legal to 14 weeks with one doctor's approval, and after that to 23 weeks with an additional doctor.

      "bodyText": "In the two weeks since an historic bill removing abortion from the New South Wales criminal code passed its first hurdle in the parliament\u2019s lower house, opponents of the legislation have fought hard to stop it becoming law. Religious leaders, rightwing MPs and conservative media commentators have all mounted a concerted campaign to derail the legislation ahead of the vote. Opponents claim the bill will allow so-called gender or sex selection and abortion \u201con demand\u201d up until birth. They have also argued for the removal of a requirement for medical practitioners with a conscientious objection to performing terminations to refer women to another doctor, and pushed for mandatory counselling for those seeking an abortion. But what does the bill actually do? What is gender or sex selection and does the bill legalise it? Will women be able to access abortions up until the time of birth, and will doctors be forced to perform them? What does the NSW reproductive healthcare reform bill do? NSW is the last state to decriminalise abortion, though it remains in the criminal code in South Australia and Western Australia in some form. That doesn\u2019t mean, however, that women do not have access to terminations. Doctors are able to conduct abortions if they believe the pregnancy is a risk to a woman\u2019s physical or mental health, and a common law precedent set in 1971 means social and economic factors may also be taken into consideration. But women accessing terminations still face a legal risk. In the past 25 years a dozen people have been prosecuted under the NSW Crimes Act for abortion offences. Four of those were found guilty and sentenced. The most recent case was in 2017, when a mother of five was prosecuted for self-administering a drug to cause a miscarriage. Based on legislation passed in Queensland last year, the reproductive healthcare reform bill 2019 removes abortion from the state\u2019s 119-year-old Crimes Act. Co-sponsored by 15 MPs from across the political divide, the original bill created a standalone healthcare act to regulate the procedure. It allows for terminations up to 22 weeks, and after that with the approval of two doctors. Were there any changes to the bill in the lower house? Opponents of the bill moved more than a dozen amendments during the lower house debate. Most failed, but there were changes to the legislation. Most significantly, medical practitioners will be required to offer counselling to a woman seeking an abortion if they believe it would be beneficial. The legislation states doctors will be required to \u201cassess whether or not it would be beneficial to discuss\u201d counselling and then offer it if the woman is interested. Another change means that after 22 weeks one of the two doctors involved in approving a termination must be a specialist obstetrician or gynaecologist, and it can only occur at a public hospital. Doctors will also have a statutory requirement to gain \u201cinformed consent\u201d before performing abortions \u2013 a change the Australian Medical Association said was unnecessary and could cause confusion. What do the bill\u2019s opponents say? The bill\u2019s supporters argue that what its opponents actually want is to stop the bill passing entirely. But the debate around the bill has prompted a number of claims about its consequences. The columnist Miranda Devine claimed the bill \u201csanctions sex-selection abortion\u201d and amounted to \u201clegal gendercide\u201d.

The amendment was rejected because, opponents said, it was unnecessary and unworkable. Instead, an amendment was passed requiring NSW Health to conduct a review into whether there was any evidence of the practice taking place. Davies relied on a 2018 study from La Trobe University which found that while the ratio of boys and girls born in Victoria was close to natural rates of 105 boys to every 100 girls, there were higher rates of boys born to mothers who had migrated from China and India.

Pocketable this thing is not, and that\u2019s a bit of a problem for true wireless earbuds because once you take them out of your ear they\u2019re easy to lose if you don\u2019t return them to the case. Admittedly the large size of the earbuds makes that less likely than some smaller options, but why the case has to be so big I\u2019m not sure.</p> <p>Like most other true wireless earbuds, the case has its own battery that\u2019s charged via Apple\u2019s Lightning cable, which is convenient for iPhone users but not so much for Android or iPad Pro users. There\u2019s no wireless charging.</p> <p>The PowerBeats Pro have class-leading battery life lasting more than eight hours between charges, where most cap out at five. The case will charge the PowerBeats Pro over 1.5 times too, meaning they last for about 24 hours of playback all combined. A quick five-minute trip in the case is worth up to 90 minutes\u2019 playback, which is handy if you forget to charge them.</p> <h2>Connectivity</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"989d1f996250b141c19826bfa807159ffa935924\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/989d1f996250b141c19826bfa807159ffa935924/0_0_4429_2658/1000.jpg\" alt=\"beats powerbeats pro review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Press the button just inside the case to trigger pairing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What gives the PowerBeats Pro their longevity is Apple\u2019s H1 chip \u2013 the same one found in the second generation AirPods. It handles the simultaneous attachment to your phone, meaning either bud can be used independently, and provides rock-solid connection even in challenging conditions.</p> <p>It also handles the instant pairing you get with an iPhone. Open the case for the first time near an iPhone and up pops a pairing prompt on the screen. Once hooked up to one Apple device they can be connected to any others you own that are signed into your iCloud account without having to re-pair them each time.</p> <p>Pairing with an Android phone is easy too. With the Beats app installed on your phone you can simply open the case near your phone and press and hold the button to pop up a prompt on your phone to pair with one tap. Otherwise simply find them in your standard Bluetooth settings to pair like anything else.</p> <p>The Beats Android app also gives you the same battery information pop-up when you open the case as you get on an iPhone, which is handy.

A protocol for dealing with cases has now been established; before, women in the market could only hold perpetrators to account informally.</p> <p>The market is divided into six zones, each with 40 departments.

      "bodyText": "Some men are in the habit of touching women, says Nora Baguma, a vendor at Nakawa market, in Uganda\u2019s capital Kampala. \u201cWe call them bayaye,\u201d she says, sitting at her banana stall. \u201cWe give men punishment for this. I take men to the office if they cause problems. They can suspend that man for a week or a month,\u201d Baguma explains. \u201cIt makes them stop. They fear us.\u201d Baguma is the women\u2019s representative of Nakawa market, one of Kampala\u2019s largest, where about 7,000 workers sell their wares. The work of a local organisation, the Institute for Social Transformation, has increased awareness about sexual harassment among women at Nakawa. A protocol for dealing with cases has now been established; before, women in the market could only hold perpetrators to account informally. The market is divided into six zones, each with 40 departments. Every department has a women\u2019s representative, and they are the first port of call for sexual harassment complaints. Next is the zone leader, and above that the market\u2019s disciplinary committee. As she puts handfuls of mukene (dried silver fish) in bags for customers, market vendor Catherine Nanzige explains how punishments vary depending on the severity of the crime. \u201cYou pay a fee of 50 to 100,000 Ugandan shillings (about \u00a310\u201320) and if you pay that fee and do the same thing again, you are given a month suspension from the market. If you continue, they expel you.\u201d A Nakawa market committee member, Nanzige has been working there since she was a child, helping at her mother\u2019s stall. \u201cThey see me and they fear me, because they know if I see them touching someone I will say that one is not in order, pay 100,000 shillings,\u201d she says. Many, though, are still reluctant to speak out \u2013 particularly younger women and girls. \u201cWaitresses serving lunch here are young, 12 or 13 years old.

A recently adopted international treaty influenced by the #MeToo movement is designed to offer such women new protections. The convention concerning the elimination of violence and harassment in the world of work has been praised for its focus on informal sector workers, who represent 61% of the world\u2019s labour force and more than 80% of Uganda\u2019s. \u201cIt has redefined the world of work to go beyond the workplace itself, and provides for all kinds of employees,\u201d explains Ophelia Kemigisha, a Ugandan human rights lawyer. The convention covers the formal and informal economy as well as public and private spaces, for example protecting the rights of women when commuting to and from work.

He has been campaigning for the White House for more than two years, and in that time has held more than 200 events in Iowa.</p> <p>On one recent Thursday morning, these efforts translated into a grand total of 11 people coming out to see Delaney, at a campaign event in the small town of Algona, in the north of the state.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/12/texas-diversity-fuels-democratic-hopes-purple-state\">Texas: Republican powerhouse could shift to Democrats as demographics change</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The former Maryland congressman, former businessman and formerly much wealthier candidate is one of a slew of long-shot candidates for the Democratic nomination. In a crowded, historically diverse field, Delaney is part of a group of white, middle-aged men who are forging ahead with their increasingly quixotic presidential campaigns in spite of a collective lack of support<strong>.</strong></p> <p>Delaney strode into Miller\u2019s Sports Bar &amp; Grill, one of a chain of bars across Iowa, just after 10am. One of his team had taped a couple of Delaney 2020 campaign posters to a wall in the back of the bar, and a sign-up list was on a table. The crowd, all silver haired apart from a thirtysomething man who walked in late, were sitting patiently at four different tables.</p> <p>Clad in the off-duty politician\u2019s uniform of open-necked shirt, blue jeans and casual brown shoes, Delaney got to work, vigorously shaking 11 hands. One member of the crowd was immediately impressed with the 56-year-old.</p> <p>\u201cYou actually look even better than you do on TV,\u201d one woman said.</p> <p>\u201cI think I\u2019m just going to stay around here,\u201d Delaney quipped.</p> <p>If Delaney was disappointed with the turnout, he didn\u2019t show it. Besides, in a way, the 11-person crowd was a positive. The night before, on Delaney\u2019s Facebook page, just two people had said they would attend, and one of those was his campaign director.</p> <p>Delaney, who served in Congress for six years before resigning to run for president, was joking when he said he might just stay around Iowa. But in fact, it would be hard for him to spend more time here. The 58-year-old has made 34 separate visits to the state in two years. This trip was the first of three in August. And the actual vote in Iowa \u2013 the state\u2019s caucuses \u2013 is still six months away.</p> <p>It\u2019s a grueling schedule. On Thursday alone, Delaney was scheduled to hold five different events in the space of nine and a half hours.</p> <p>With the pleasantries over at Miller\u2019s Delaney dived into his pitch. The two most important questions in 2020, he said, are: \u201cWho can beat Trump?\u201d and: \u201cWho is the best leader for this country at this moment in time?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9ff1b5b4dd69550615c5b0cb2cf8de2955fc171e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ff1b5b4dd69550615c5b0cb2cf8de2955fc171e/0_135_5879_3528/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Delaney gestures at the end of his speech during a visit to the Iowa state fair in Des Moines earlier this month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Delaney gestures at the end of his speech during a visit to the Iowa state fair in Des Moines earlier this month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charlie Neibergall/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI believe I\u2019m the right answer to those two questions,\u201d he concluded.</p> <p>Delaney\u2019s problem is that very few people agree. Despite a marathon campaign \u2013 he declared his candidacy in July 2017, 18 months before any other major contenders \u2013 and a big pot of cash, he is barely registering \u2013 even in Iowa. Delaney is currently polling <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/ia/iowa_democratic_presidential_caucus-6731.html\">at 1%</a> in the state \u2013 in ninth place. Nationally, Delaney has just <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/2020_democratic_presidential_nomination-6730.html\">0.3%</a> of the vote.</p> <p>But Delaney, an electrician\u2019s son turned millionaire, isn\u2019t about to let a near total lack of support stop him.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be the president just to be the president,\u201d Delaney said at his second event of the day. \u201cI want to be the president to do the job.\u201d</p> <p>Later, Delaney was speaking to a crowd of 15 people, at the Rustic Brew in Hampton, an hour and a half drive east of Algona. He had been allocated an area in the back, in a room with a painting of a reindeer on one wall. Delaney had almost immediately been interrupted by a man wearing a Vietnam cap.</p> <p>The man complained about veterans\u2019 hospitals. Delaney, hoping to appease him, said he would allow veterans to visit a wider range of hospitals for their care. The man in the cap said that was exactly the plan he was opposed to. Delaney said he would talk to him about it later, then carried on with his speech. The man in the cap slumped in his chair, mumbling something to himself.</p> <p>The main part of Delaney\u2019s pitch is that he can beat Donald Trump and actually pass legislation, whereas, in his view, people such as the leftwing senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are making \u201cimpossible promises\u201d. </p> <p>After Delaney criticized the more ambitious proposals of his rivals during the recent televised Democratic debates, Warren chopped him down, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/30/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-debate.html\">telling the audience</a>: \u201cI don\u2019t understand why anybody goes to all the trouble of running for president of the United States just to talk about what we really can\u2019t do and shouldn\u2019t fight for.\u201d</p> <p>Far from being cowed by that, Delaney told the Guardian that if he could change one thing about his campaign, he actually would have plugged his centrist credentials earlier.</p> <p>\u201cThe kind of sharp contrasts I\u2019m making now, I would have made them earlier,\u201d Delaney said.</p> <p>But what Delaney lacks in support, he makes up for in optimism. He brushed off concerns that he won\u2019t make the next Democratic debates \u2013 the bar for entry is far higher for the next round, in mid-September \u2013 by insisting he could make the one after that, because he expects other candidates to drop out.</p> <p>As Delaney closed out at the Rustic Brew, his campaign manager abruptly announced that the rest of the day\u2019s events were cancelled.

      "bodyText": "John Delaney has poured a staggering $24m of his own money into running for president. He has been campaigning for the White House for more than two years, and in that time has held more than 200 events in Iowa. On one recent Thursday morning, these efforts translated into a grand total of 11 people coming out to see Delaney, at a campaign event in the small town of Algona, in the north of the state. The former Maryland congressman, former businessman and formerly much wealthier candidate is one of a slew of long-shot candidates for the Democratic nomination. In a crowded, historically diverse field, Delaney is part of a group of white, middle-aged men who are forging ahead with their increasingly quixotic presidential campaigns in spite of a collective lack of support. Delaney strode into Miller\u2019s Sports Bar &amp; Grill, one of a chain of bars across Iowa, just after 10am. One of his team had taped a couple of Delaney 2020 campaign posters to a wall in the back of the bar, and a sign-up list was on a table. The crowd, all silver haired apart from a thirtysomething man who walked in late, were sitting patiently at four different tables. Clad in the off-duty politician\u2019s uniform of open-necked shirt, blue jeans and casual brown shoes, Delaney got to work, vigorously shaking 11 hands. One member of the crowd was immediately impressed with the 56-year-old. \u201cYou actually look even better than you do on TV,\u201d one woman said. \u201cI think I\u2019m just going to stay around here,\u201d Delaney quipped. If Delaney was disappointed with the turnout, he didn\u2019t show it. Besides, in a way, the 11-person crowd was a positive. The night before, on Delaney\u2019s Facebook page, just two people had said they would attend, and one of those was his campaign director. Delaney, who served in Congress for six years before resigning to run for president, was joking when he said he might just stay around Iowa. But in fact, it would be hard for him to spend more time here. The 58-year-old has made 34 separate visits to the state in two years. This trip was the first of three in August. And the actual vote in Iowa \u2013 the state\u2019s caucuses \u2013 is still six months away. It\u2019s a grueling schedule. On Thursday alone, Delaney was scheduled to hold five different events in the space of nine and a half hours. With the pleasantries over at Miller\u2019s Delaney dived into his pitch. The two most important questions in 2020, he said, are: \u201cWho can beat Trump?\u201d and: \u201cWho is the best leader for this country at this moment in time?\u201d \u201cI believe I\u2019m the right answer to those two questions,\u201d he concluded. Delaney\u2019s problem is that very few people agree. Despite a marathon campaign \u2013 he declared his candidacy in July 2017, 18 months before any other major contenders \u2013 and a big pot of cash, he is barely registering \u2013 even in Iowa. Delaney is currently polling at 1% in the state \u2013 in ninth place. Nationally, Delaney has just 0.3% of the vote. But Delaney, an electrician\u2019s son turned millionaire, isn\u2019t about to let a near total lack of support stop him. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be the president just to be the president,\u201d Delaney said at his second event of the day. \u201cI want to be the president to do the job.\u201d Later, Delaney was speaking to a crowd of 15 people, at the Rustic Brew in Hampton, an hour and a half drive east of Algona. He had been allocated an area in the back, in a room with a painting of a reindeer on one wall. Delaney had almost immediately been interrupted by a man wearing a Vietnam cap. The man complained about veterans\u2019 hospitals. Delaney, hoping to appease him, said he would allow veterans to visit a wider range of hospitals for their care. The man in the cap said that was exactly the plan he was opposed to. Delaney said he would talk to him about it later, then carried on with his speech. The man in the cap slumped in his chair, mumbling something to himself. The main part of Delaney\u2019s pitch is that he can beat Donald Trump and actually pass legislation, whereas, in his view, people such as the leftwing senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are making \u201cimpossible promises\u201d. After Delaney criticized the more ambitious proposals of his rivals during the recent televised Democratic debates, Warren chopped him down, telling the audience: \u201cI don\u2019t understand why anybody goes to all the trouble of running for president of the United States just to talk about what we really can\u2019t do and shouldn\u2019t fight for.\u201d Far from being cowed by that, Delaney told the Guardian that if he could change one thing about his campaign, he actually would have plugged his centrist credentials earlier. \u201cThe kind of sharp contrasts I\u2019m making now, I would have made them earlier,\u201d Delaney said. But what Delaney lacks in support, he makes up for in optimism. He brushed off concerns that he won\u2019t make the next Democratic debates \u2013 the bar for entry is far higher for the next round, in mid-September \u2013 by insisting he could make the one after that, because he expects other candidates to drop out. As Delaney closed out at the Rustic Brew, his campaign manager abruptly announced that the rest of the day\u2019s events were cancelled. He had only completed two out of five. The campaign manager put it down to a schedule conflict. The Guardian chased Delaney down in Des Moines the next day, where he was appearing at the Iowa state fair. Delaney spent some time prodding pork chops on a grill \u2013 a classic state fair photo opportunity \u2013 before speaking for about 15 minutes to a crowd, again pitching his centrist vision. He drew a decent number of people, but his crowd was dwarfed by those who came out for speeches by Warren, Sanders and Biden. \ufeffDelaney is probably right when he says other people will soon quit the race. The California congressman Eric Swalwell ended his campaign in July, citing a lack of money and a lack of support. Colorado ex-governor John Hickenlooper dropped out last week. Delaney doesn\u2019t have to make that choice yet. He has loaned his campaign $24m, but according to Forbes, he is worth $200m, so he has plenty of cash left to splurge. But there will surely come a point where he has to make a decision. Given Delaney is polling within the margin of error of zero, that point might come soon. Or perhaps Delaney, ever the optimist, could bide his time. If Trump wins in 2020, then there\u2019s always 2024. If Delaney doesn\u2019t bankrupt himself first, maybe he could be a contender. At the very least, he will know his way around Iowa.",

It continues: \u201cin order to maintain and increase his supply of victims, Epstein also paid certain of his victims to recruit additional girls to be similarly abused.\u201d</p> <p>Some of his victims were reportedly as young as 14. Virginia Giuffre was one of those girls, claiming in newly unsealed documents that she was \u201crecruited\u201d at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida by socialite, heiress, and Epstein\u2019s alleged accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell in 2000, when she was just 16.

He surrounded himself with prominent scientists, Harvard professors, multiple Nobel Prize winners, authors, almost exclusively men \u2013 Epstein kept his social gatherings stocked with some of the world\u2019s most eminent figures in this world.</p> <p>He would host dinners at his Upper East side Manhattan apartment and invite a mix of leading scientists and people from the world of fashion and modeling. One scientist, who preferred to remain anonymous, told Slate that there was virtually no interaction between these two sets of guests . \u201cSometimes he\u2019d turn to his left and ask some science-y questions. Then he\u2019d turn to his right and ask the model to show him her portfolio.\u201d Slate claimed that a young \u201cfemale staffer\u201d emerged in the middle of one of these dinners to give Epstein a neck massage while he talked. </p> <p>When he gathered <a href=\"https://slate.com/technology/2019/08/jeffrey-epstein-science-eugenics-sexual-abuse-researchers.html\">21 physicists</a> on his private island for a 2006 meeting about gravity, he reportedly had three to four young women in tow at all times. He also met many scientists at an annual gathering hosted by John Brockman, a literary agent who represented famous science authors such as Stephen Hawking and Jared Diamond. Nobel-winning physicist Murray Gell-Mann, who discovered the quark and was <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/1999/09/brockman-2/\">represented</a> by Brockman, thanked Epstein for his financial support in the acknowledgments section of his 1995 <a href=\"https://archive.org/stream/MurrayGellMannTheQuarkAndTheJaguarAdventuresInTheSimpleAndTheComplex1995St.MartinsGriffin.compressed/Murray%20Gell-Mann%20-%20The%20Quark%20and%20the%20Jaguar_%20Adventures%20in%20the%20Simple%20and%20the%20Complex%20(1995,%20St.%20Martin's%20Griffin).compressed_djvu.txt\">book</a>, The Quark and the Jaguar.</p> <p>A partial list of the biggest scientific names in Epstein\u2019s orbit, according to the New York Times includes \u201cthe theoretical physicist and best-selling author Stephen Hawking; the paleontologist and evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould; Oliver Sacks, the neurologist and best-selling author; George M Church, a molecular engineer who has worked to identify genes that could be altered to create superior humans; and the MIT theoretical physicist Frank Wilczek, a Nobel laureate\u201d.</p> <p>Epstein called himself a \u201cscience philanthropist\u201d, and donated handsomely to prestigious organizations such as Harvard, MIT, and the Santa Fe Institute. At one point, he was allegedly giving as much as $20m a year to fund scientists. Some institutions and researchers continued to take Epstein\u2019s money even <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/peteraldhous/jeffrey-epstein-sex-trafficking-science-donations\">after his 2008 conviction</a>, like MIT, according to BuzzFeed News.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Epstein called himself a 'science philanthropist' and donated handsomely to prestigious organizations</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Joi Ito, the head of MIT\u2019s world-famous Media Lab issued an apology last week for having accepted donations for the Media Lab and his own tech startups. In his open letter on the MIT Media Lab\u2019s website, he said: \u201cI take full responsibility for my error in judgment. I am deeply sorry to the survivors, to the Media Lab, and to the MIT community for bringing such a person into our network.</p> <p>\u201cRegrettably, over the years, the Lab has received money through some of the foundations that he controlled. I also allowed him to invest in several of my funds which invest in tech startup companies outside of MIT\u2019s.\u201d</p> <p>Last month Jenna Marshall, a spokesperson for the Santa Fe Institute, said in the BuzzFeed News story that a $25,000 donation in 2010 from Epstein \u201cprompted our leadership to decide not to accept any additional funds from Mr Epstein or related sources\u201d. They were, she said, considering donating an equal amount to a charity working with victims of sex trafficking.</p> <p>Several years after his 2008 conviction, publications including Forbes, the National Review, and HuffPo all ran stories on Epstein praising him as a selfless philanthropist, \u201ca hedge-funder with a zealous science background\u201d, and \u201cone of the largest backers of cutting-edge science around the world\u201d. None of the articles mentioned his criminal history, and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/21/business/media/jeffrey-epstein-media.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage\">an investigation</a> by the New York Times claimed they were used as part of a public relations campaign to revamp Epstein\u2019s image. All three publications have since deleted or amended articles cited by the New York Times.</p> <p>By most accounts, he would engage with his guests at his science-related parties but never for very long or very deeply, often derailing conversations by abruptly changing topics or turning other people\u2019s comments into jokes. </p> <p> Still, some of the scientists seemed smitten. <a href=\"http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/n_7912/\">In a 2002 profile</a> of Epstein for New York Magazine, Martin Nowak, now a professor of biology and mathematics and head of the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics at Harvard, said that he once broke out a blackboard during dinner with Epstein and, for two hours, gave a mathematical description of how language works. \u201cJeffrey has the mind of a physicist. It\u2019s like talking to a colleague in your field. Sometimes he applies what we talk about to his investments. Sometimes it\u2019s for his own curiosity. He has changed my life. Because of his support, I feel I can do anything I want,\u201d Nowak said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Jeffrey has the mind of a physicist. He has changed my life. Because of his support, I feel I can do anything I want</p> <footer> <cite>Martin Nowak</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Lawrence Krauss, a physicist who retired from Arizona State University, even continued defending Epstein after his 2008 conviction, telling the Daily Beast in 2011: \u201cAs a scientist I always judge things on empirical evidence and he always has women ages 19 to 23 around him, but I\u2019ve never seen anything else, so as a scientist, my presumption is that whatever the problems were I would believe him over other people.\u201d He added, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/katie-couric-woody-allen-jeffrey-epsteins-society-friends-close-ranks\">I don\u2019t feel tarnished</a> in any way by my relationship with Jeffrey; I feel raised by it.\u201d</p> <p>Other scientists seem to have been drawn to the attention and spotlight that Epstein gave them. Evolutionary biologist George Church, one of the few researchers who has apologized for having contact with Epstein, which he attributes to <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2019/08/05/citing-nerd-tunnel-vision-biologist-george-church-apologizes-for-contacts-with-jeffrey-epstein/\">\u201cnerd tunnel vision</a><a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2019/08/05/citing-nerd-tunnel-vision-biologist-george-church-apologizes-for-contacts-with-jeffrey-epstein/\">\u201d</a>, told STAT News that \u201che is used to financiers, technologists, and celebrities seeking him out, and has become a quasi-celebrity himself\u201d.</p> <p> Many of the scientists and researchers began distancing themselves from Epstein after 2008 and have publicly condemned him since his arrest in July. Scoene author Steven Pinker, who was flown to a TED Conference on Epstein\u2019s private jet in 2002, including Daniel Dennetand John Brockman, has recently refuted any suggestions that he knew, or had any relationship with Epstein. In a response published on the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Evolutionistrue\">@evolutionistrue</a> website, Pinker said: \u201cThe annoying irony is that I could never stand the guy, never took research funding from him, and always tried to keep my distance. I think the dislike was mutual \u2013 according to a friend, he \u2018voted me off the island\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGiven my longstanding distaste for everything Epstein, it\u2019s galling to be publicly associated with him based on some photos and mutual associates.\u201d</p> <p>He explained the private jet to the TED conference, in a tweet last month:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/sapinker/status/1149153596350578689\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I have no relationship with Epstein &amp; have taken no funding from him. Our circles have occasionally overlapped: In 02, my lit agent invited me to join a group of east-coast TED speakers Epstein flew to CA. In 14, Krauss seated me next to him at a lunch, &amp; someone snapped a photo.</p>&mdash; Steven Pinker (@sapinker) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sapinker/status/1149153596350578689?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 11, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Dennett has since said he had never heard of Epstein when he boarded the jet.</p> <p>But while Epstein may not have been able to contribute much to the conversations he cultivated around him, he did have sincere interest in at least some scientific topics.</p> <p>The New York Times did a deep dive into Epstein\u2019s scientific beliefs in an article titled <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/31/business/jeffrey-epstein-eugenics.html\">Jeffrey Epstein Hoped to Seed Human Race With His DNA</a>. The Times\u2019 reporters found that Epstein was apparently fixated on \u201ctranshumanism\u201d, the belief that the human species can be deliberately advanced through technological breakthroughs, such as genetic engineering and artificial intelligence. </p> <p>At its most benign, transhumanism is a belief that humanity\u2019s problems can be improved, upgraded even, through such technology as cybernetics and artificial intelligence \u2013 at its most malignant though, transhumanism lines up uncomfortably well with eugenics.</p> <p>Eugenics is the belief that humanity can be improved by controlled breeding, selecting for preferable traits and minimizing less desirable ones. Alan Dershowitz, professor emeritus of law at Harvard and a former lawyer of Epstein\u2019s, said in the New York Times<em> </em>investigation that Epstein would at times steer conversations about how to improve the human race genetically, an idea that appalled Dershowitz because of the overlap with Nazi theories about eugenics.</p> <p>Epstein was allegedly fascinated with and inspired by the Repository for Germinal Choice, which was founded in Escondido, California, in 1980 by Robert K Graham, an avowed eugenicist and tycoon who got rich developing shatterproof eyeglass lenses. Graham\u2019s goal was the \u201cstrengthening of the human gene pool\u201dand he would accomplish this with the Repository, a sperm bank where all the donors were Nobel laureates. At least that\u2019s how it was supposed to work: <a href=\"https://slate.com/human-interest/2001/02/the-genius-babies-and-how-they-grew.html\">according to a 2001 story</a> in Slate, Graham only ever convinced three or five (the stories vary) to actually contribute, and the Repository shuttered in 1999.</p> <p>But Epstein was apparently taken with the idea. In his version though, rather than a bunch of lettered academics, he\u2019d be the one \u201cstrengthening the gene pool\u201d. Starting in the early 2000s, he reportedly told multiple people that he wanted to impregnate as many women as he could to distribute his genes as widely as possible. Several acquaintances told the New York Times that Epstein mentioned using his sprawling New Mexico ranch as a base of operations, and at least one person said he planned to impregnate up to 20 women at a time. </p> <p>The puzzle at the heart of Epstein\u2019s fandom is how it lasted for so long and why he managed to draw so many scientists into this circle. As Katha Pollit, writing in the Nation last week said: \u201cWhat I can\u2019t get over is how Epstein successfully weaseled his way into science at the highest level by cultivating major figures in the field socially and spreading his wealth around. Science! The very temple of the pursuit of truth. Call me insufficiently jaded, but am I wrong to expect more of those we rely on to combat all of the nonsense swirling around us?\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "According to his indictment, over the course of many years Jeffrey Epstein \u201csexually exploited and abused dozens of minor girls at his homes in Manhattan, New York, and Palm Beach, Florida, among other locations\u201d. It continues: \u201cin order to maintain and increase his supply of victims, Epstein also paid certain of his victims to recruit additional girls to be similarly abused.\u201d Some of his victims were reportedly as young as 14. Virginia Giuffre was one of those girls, claiming in newly unsealed documents that she was \u201crecruited\u201d at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida by socialite, heiress, and Epstein\u2019s alleged accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell in 2000, when she was just 16. Giuffre now describes her time with Epstein as being forced to be a \u201csex slave\u201d. Shortly after her sworn deposition became public Epstein was found dead in his holding cell, apparently from suicide. Epstein\u2019s lifestyle has been well documented: he owned a private island in the US Virgin Islands and jetted around the world with rich and powerful men, including the Clintons, Trump, Woody Allen, Larry Bird and Prince Andrew. He had been indicted in 2008, when he walked away with a \u201csweetheart deal\u201d that gave him minimal jail time and shielded any possible co-conspirators. One aspect of Epstein\u2019s life of luxury seems incongruously out of place though. He surrounded himself with prominent scientists, Harvard professors, multiple Nobel Prize winners, authors, almost exclusively men \u2013 Epstein kept his social gatherings stocked with some of the world\u2019s most eminent figures in this world. He would host dinners at his Upper East side Manhattan apartment and invite a mix of leading scientists and people from the world of fashion and modeling. One scientist, who preferred to remain anonymous, told Slate that there was virtually no interaction between these two sets of guests . \u201cSometimes he\u2019d turn to his left and ask some science-y questions. Then he\u2019d turn to his right and ask the model to show him her portfolio.\u201d Slate claimed that a young \u201cfemale staffer\u201d emerged in the middle of one of these dinners to give Epstein a neck massage while he talked. When he gathered 21 physicists on his private island for a 2006 meeting about gravity, he reportedly had three to four young women in tow at all times. He also met many scientists at an annual gathering hosted by John Brockman, a literary agent who represented famous science authors such as Stephen Hawking and Jared Diamond. Nobel-winning physicist Murray Gell-Mann, who discovered the quark and was represented by Brockman, thanked Epstein for his financial support in the acknowledgments section of his 1995 book, The Quark and the Jaguar. A partial list of the biggest scientific names in Epstein\u2019s orbit, according to the New York Times includes \u201cthe theoretical physicist and best-selling author Stephen Hawking; the paleontologist and evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould; Oliver Sacks, the neurologist and best-selling author; George M Church, a molecular engineer who has worked to identify genes that could be altered to create superior humans; and the MIT theoretical physicist Frank Wilczek, a Nobel laureate\u201d. Epstein called himself a \u201cscience philanthropist\u201d, and donated handsomely to prestigious organizations such as Harvard, MIT, and the Santa Fe Institute. At one point, he was allegedly giving as much as $20m a year to fund scientists. Some institutions and researchers continued to take Epstein\u2019s money even after his 2008 conviction, like MIT, according to BuzzFeed News. Joi Ito, the head of MIT\u2019s world-famous Media Lab issued an apology last week for having accepted donations for the Media Lab and his own tech startups. In his open letter on the MIT Media Lab\u2019s website, he said: \u201cI take full responsibility for my error in judgment. I am deeply sorry to the survivors, to the Media Lab, and to the MIT community for bringing such a person into our network. \u201cRegrettably, over the years, the Lab has received money through some of the foundations that he controlled. I also allowed him to invest in several of my funds which invest in tech startup companies outside of MIT\u2019s.\u201d Last month Jenna Marshall, a spokesperson for the Santa Fe Institute, said in the BuzzFeed News story that a $25,000 donation in 2010 from Epstein \u201cprompted our leadership to decide not to accept any additional funds from Mr Epstein or related sources\u201d. They were, she said, considering donating an equal amount to a charity working with victims of sex trafficking. Several years after his 2008 conviction, publications including Forbes, the National Review, and HuffPo all ran stories on Epstein praising him as a selfless philanthropist, \u201ca hedge-funder with a zealous science background\u201d, and \u201cone of the largest backers of cutting-edge science around the world\u201d. None of the articles mentioned his criminal history, and an investigation by the New York Times claimed they were used as part of a public relations campaign to revamp Epstein\u2019s image. All three publications have since deleted or amended articles cited by the New York Times. By most accounts, he would engage with his guests at his science-related parties but never for very long or very deeply, often derailing conversations by abruptly changing topics or turning other people\u2019s comments into jokes. Still, some of the scientists seemed smitten. In a 2002 profile of Epstein for New York Magazine, Martin Nowak, now a professor of biology and mathematics and head of the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics at Harvard, said that he once broke out a blackboard during dinner with Epstein and, for two hours, gave a mathematical description of how language works. \u201cJeffrey has the mind of a physicist. It\u2019s like talking to a colleague in your field. Sometimes he applies what we talk about to his investments. Sometimes it\u2019s for his own curiosity. He has changed my life. Because of his support, I feel I can do anything I want,\u201d Nowak said. Lawrence Krauss, a physicist who retired from Arizona State University, even continued defending Epstein after his 2008 conviction, telling the Daily Beast in 2011: \u201cAs a scientist I always judge things on empirical evidence and he always has women ages 19 to 23 around him, but I\u2019ve never seen anything else, so as a scientist, my presumption is that whatever the problems were I would believe him over other people.\u201d He added, \u201cI don\u2019t feel tarnished in any way by my relationship with Jeffrey; I feel raised by it.\u201d Other scientists seem to have been drawn to the attention and spotlight that Epstein gave them. Evolutionary biologist George Church, one of the few researchers who has apologized for having contact with Epstein, which he attributes to \u201cnerd tunnel vision\u201d, told STAT News that \u201che is used to financiers, technologists, and celebrities seeking him out, and has become a quasi-celebrity himself\u201d. Many of the scientists and researchers began distancing themselves from Epstein after 2008 and have publicly condemned him since his arrest in July. Scoene author Steven Pinker, who was flown to a TED Conference on Epstein\u2019s private jet in 2002, including Daniel Dennetand John Brockman, has recently refuted any suggestions that he knew, or had any relationship with Epstein. In a response published on the @evolutionistrue website, Pinker said: \u201cThe annoying irony is that I could never stand the guy, never took research funding from him, and always tried to keep my distance. I think the dislike was mutual \u2013 according to a friend, he \u2018voted me off the island\u2019.\u201d \u201cGiven my longstanding distaste for everything Epstein, it\u2019s galling to be publicly associated with him based on some photos and mutual associates.\u201d He explained the private jet to the TED conference, in a tweet last month: Dennett has since said he had never heard of Epstein when he boarded the jet. But while Epstein may not have been able to contribute much to the conversations he cultivated around him, he did have sincere interest in at least some scientific topics. The New York Times did a deep dive into Epstein\u2019s scientific beliefs in an article titled Jeffrey Epstein Hoped to Seed Human Race With His DNA. The Times\u2019 reporters found that Epstein was apparently fixated on \u201ctranshumanism\u201d, the belief that the human species can be deliberately advanced through technological breakthroughs, such as genetic engineering and artificial intelligence. At its most benign, transhumanism is a belief that humanity\u2019s problems can be improved, upgraded even, through such technology as cybernetics and artificial intelligence \u2013 at its most malignant though, transhumanism lines up uncomfortably well with eugenics. Eugenics is the belief that humanity can be improved by controlled breeding, selecting for preferable traits and minimizing less desirable ones. Alan Dershowitz, professor emeritus of law at Harvard and a former lawyer of Epstein\u2019s, said in the New York Times investigation that Epstein would at times steer conversations about how to improve the human race genetically, an idea that appalled Dershowitz because of the overlap with Nazi theories about eugenics. Epstein was allegedly fascinated with and inspired by the Repository for Germinal Choice, which was founded in Escondido, California, in 1980 by Robert K Graham, an avowed eugenicist and tycoon who got rich developing shatterproof eyeglass lenses. Graham\u2019s goal was the \u201cstrengthening of the human gene pool\u201dand he would accomplish this with the Repository, a sperm bank where all the donors were Nobel laureates. At least that\u2019s how it was supposed to work: according to a 2001 story in Slate, Graham only ever convinced three or five (the stories vary) to actually contribute, and the Repository shuttered in 1999. But Epstein was apparently taken with the idea. In his version though, rather than a bunch of lettered academics, he\u2019d be the one \u201cstrengthening the gene pool\u201d. Starting in the early 2000s, he reportedly told multiple people that he wanted to impregnate as many women as he could to distribute his genes as widely as possible. Several acquaintances told the New York Times that Epstein mentioned using his sprawling New Mexico ranch as a base of operations, and at least one person said he planned to impregnate up to 20 women at a time. The puzzle at the heart of Epstein\u2019s fandom is how it lasted for so long and why he managed to draw so many scientists into this circle. As Katha Pollit, writing in the Nation last week said: \u201cWhat I can\u2019t get over is how Epstein successfully weaseled his way into science at the highest level by cultivating major figures in the field socially and spreading his wealth around. Science! The very temple of the pursuit of truth. Call me insufficiently jaded, but am I wrong to expect more of those we rely on to combat all of the nonsense swirling around us?\u201d",

His mother was a Jehovah\u2019s Witness who despised his photos and threw out his artwork when he was a teenager, which led him to moving away from home.

It said that advertisers in the US, UK, and Ireland who ran abortion-related ads had to disclose to Google whether they did or did not provide termination services, and that the information would be tagged on to advertisements when users searched under \u201ckeywords related to getting an abortion\u201d. The tags, which appear in small grey print under the advertisement, say \u201cDoes not provide abortion\u201d or \u201cProvides abortion\u201d.</p> <p>Google declined to comment on the number of ads that have been affected by its new policy and said that the fact that some ads were still being published without any tags \u2013 depending on the search term \u2013 was not a loophole. The policy, the company said, was purposely designed to only target \u201cabortion\u201d keywords.</p> <p>Google said in a statement to the Guardian: \u201cThis additional transparency is meant to help users decide which abortion-related ads are most relevant to them. Our policies already prohibit misrepresentation in ads and if we find ads that violate our policies, we immediately remove them.\u201d</p> <p>Crisis pregnancy centers and anti-choice activists were angered by the change in Google\u2019s policy when it was announced in May. An article on pregnancyhelpnews.com, a website run by Heartbeat International, a Christian organization, said the new tags were \u201creducing the ability for pregnancy centers to compete with abortion providers on a digital scale\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWomen deserve to have the information they need before making an abortion decision, not just abortion information from those who profit from abortion,\u201d the article stated.</p> <p>But it added that there was also \u201cgood news for life-affirming pregnancy help organizations\u201d, because not all Google ads were automatically impacted. It then pointed out that advertisements tied to keyword searches for \u201cfree pregnancy tests\u201d did not have the tags.</p> <p>Alice Huling, counsel at the Campaign for Accountability, a liberal ethics watchdog and Google critic, said Google\u2019s policy change had not given enough thought to the ways in which users use the search engine.</p> <p>\u201cGoogle knows that there are a lot of CPCs out there that are actively trying to trick women about their reproductive health options,\u201d Huling said. \u201cThere is no reason that those same tags couldn\u2019t be applied across the board.\u201d</p> <p>Huling said many women turning to Google for information, especially about an unplanned pregnancy, might be doing a \u201cgeneric\u201d search for information about their options, and that crisis pregnancy centers were purposely targeting women who were possibly thinking about abortion.</p> <p>\u201cThey are trying to locate and populate those searches so that in a face-to-face discussion they can try to convince a woman to not have an abortion, including through ultrasounds or providing false information about or health and safety concerns,\u201d she added.</p> <p>In one case found by the Guardian, a search using the term \u201cabortion\u201d resulted in an advertisement for a website called yourabortionchoice.org. The search produced a tag that stated that the center \u201cDoes not provide abortions\u201d. But a search for \u201cfree pregnancy test\u201d, which resulted in the same ad being shown, did not provide the information.</p> <p>The yourabortionchoice.org website provides visitors with a phone number and states on its website \u201cwe\u2019re here to empower you with the information you need to make the choice that is best for you, your body and health\u201d. Although it is not immediately evident, the website is run by a company called Heroic Media, which states as its mission that it is seeking to \u201csave lives from abortion\u201d.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A new Google policy that was meant to rein in deceptive advertising by \u201ccrisis pregnancy centers\u201d has a loophole that is allowing the centers to continue to post misleading ads on the search engine. Crisis pregnancy centers often seek to aggressively discourage women from getting abortions and have earned the ire of abortion rights groups for often seeming to resemble abortion clinics. The loophole means only users who are specifically searching under the term \u201cabortion\u201d will be provided information on Google\u2019s website about whether a particular health care clinic does \u2013 or does not \u2013 offer the procedure to women. If a user searches under other terms, like \u201cfree pregnancy test\u201d or \u201cpregnancy symptoms\u201d, no such information appears under the advertisements for the same clinics. While the difference might seem semantic, there is a worry that it will confuse women who might mistake a crisis pregnancy center for an abortion clinic. The ability of crisis pregnancy centers to influence possibly vulnerable women with false information is seen by pro-choice advocates as a significant challenge at a time when access to legal abortion is being curtailed in many states across the US. Carolyn Maloney, a Democratic congresswoman from New York, said that while she was pleased that Google had take a step toward transparency, \u201cit was just a first step\u201d. \u201cI hope [Google] will monitor loopholes in its policy that may still allow these centers to purposely deceive pregnant women about the services they do or do not offer,\u201d Maloney said in a statement to the Guardian. Google\u2019s handling of abortion-related advertising has been a source of controversy for years, with pro-choice advocates saying that it has allowed crisis pregnancy centers to propagate false information about the services they offer in violation of Google\u2019s rules against deceptive advertising. In many cases, advertisements for crisis pregnancy centers suggest that women can visit their clinics to either obtain an abortion or get more information about their choices, even though such centers are vehemently opposed to abortion. In May, Google unveiled a new policy to try to tackle the problem. It said that advertisers in the US, UK, and Ireland who ran abortion-related ads had to disclose to Google whether they did or did not provide termination services, and that the information would be tagged on to advertisements when users searched under \u201ckeywords related to getting an abortion\u201d. The tags, which appear in small grey print under the advertisement, say \u201cDoes not provide abortion\u201d or \u201cProvides abortion\u201d. Google declined to comment on the number of ads that have been affected by its new policy and said that the fact that some ads were still being published without any tags \u2013 depending on the search term \u2013 was not a loophole. The policy, the company said, was purposely designed to only target \u201cabortion\u201d keywords. Google said in a statement to the Guardian: \u201cThis additional transparency is meant to help users decide which abortion-related ads are most relevant to them. Our policies already prohibit misrepresentation in ads and if we find ads that violate our policies, we immediately remove them.\u201d Crisis pregnancy centers and anti-choice activists were angered by the change in Google\u2019s policy when it was announced in May. An article on pregnancyhelpnews.com, a website run by Heartbeat International, a Christian organization, said the new tags were \u201creducing the ability for pregnancy centers to compete with abortion providers on a digital scale\u201d. \u201cWomen deserve to have the information they need before making an abortion decision, not just abortion information from those who profit from abortion,\u201d the article stated. But it added that there was also \u201cgood news for life-affirming pregnancy help organizations\u201d, because not all Google ads were automatically impacted. It then pointed out that advertisements tied to keyword searches for \u201cfree pregnancy tests\u201d did not have the tags. Alice Huling, counsel at the Campaign for Accountability, a liberal ethics watchdog and Google critic, said Google\u2019s policy change had not given enough thought to the ways in which users use the search engine. \u201cGoogle knows that there are a lot of CPCs out there that are actively trying to trick women about their reproductive health options,\u201d Huling said. \u201cThere is no reason that those same tags couldn\u2019t be applied across the board.\u201d Huling said many women turning to Google for information, especially about an unplanned pregnancy, might be doing a \u201cgeneric\u201d search for information about their options, and that crisis pregnancy centers were purposely targeting women who were possibly thinking about abortion. \u201cThey are trying to locate and populate those searches so that in a face-to-face discussion they can try to convince a woman to not have an abortion, including through ultrasounds or providing false information about or health and safety concerns,\u201d she added. In one case found by the Guardian, a search using the term \u201cabortion\u201d resulted in an advertisement for a website called yourabortionchoice.org. The search produced a tag that stated that the center \u201cDoes not provide abortions\u201d. But a search for \u201cfree pregnancy test\u201d, which resulted in the same ad being shown, did not provide the information. The yourabortionchoice.org website provides visitors with a phone number and states on its website \u201cwe\u2019re here to empower you with the information you need to make the choice that is best for you, your body and health\u201d. Although it is not immediately evident, the website is run by a company called Heroic Media, which states as its mission that it is seeking to \u201csave lives from abortion\u201d.",

This was the latest twist in a story we have been following since November 2015 when the US-owned company issued a safety warning after some models under these brands had a fault that could make them catch fire. It then launched a programme to modify an estimated 3.8m machines, but the company faced criticism over its decision not to go ahead with a straightforward recall of models at risk of fire. It initially told customers they could continue to use their tumble dryer while awaiting modification, provided it was not left unattended. But the Guardian revealed its change of advice in February 2017, when it told owners of the \u201cat risk\u201d machines to unplug the appliances and stop using them until they were repaired. Whirlpool said it had logged 54 fires in its tumble dryers in recent years, and said three of the models involved had already been updated. Its latest figures revealed there have so far been 1.7m products modified. Owners are now being given the choice of a free replacement, an upgrade to a superior model from \u00a359, a repair or full refund dependent on the machine\u2019s age. We asked Whirlpool how someone like you could have fallen through the net. It says: \u201cWe apologise for any distress caused by this situation. The safety of our customers is our top priority so we are deeply concerned by the point AK raises. We have investigated this as a matter of urgency and can confirm that the model AK owns is one of those subject to the recall. We have contacted her to ensure that her appliance is remedied. We have investigated the potential reasons for her appliance being initially identified as unaffected, but it is very difficult to determine the exact cause without evidence of the date inputted into the system.\u201d We asked Electrical Safety First (ESF) for its view. Chief executive Phil Buckle says: \u201cWhile we\u2019re yet to hear of any similar reports of dryers that have changed status in Whirlpool\u2019s database from \u2018safe\u2019 to \u2018affected\u2019, the fact that one owner\u2019s machine appears to have done so is concerning \u2026 ESF would urge any owners of Hotpoint, Indesit, Swan, Proline or Creda branded tumble dryers to double check their machines are safe with the model checker on the Whirlpool website, or over the phone on 0800 151 0905.\u201d If Whirlpool does find that its model checker at one point did not account for all affected models, it must communicate this clearly so that no consumers are left under the false presumption that their tumble dryer is safe.

The Clitarchus hookeri is native to New Zealand but migrated to the UK some time between 1910 and 1935, catching a ride on shiploads of New Zealand plants that were transported to the subtropical Tresco Abbey Garden on the Scilly Isles islands off the coast of Cornwall. Biologists from Massey University in New Zealand\u2019s North Island have discovered that some time in the last 100 years the Scilly isles population of Clitarchus hookeri gave up having sex and start to reproduce asexually.

      "bodyText": "Protestors in the West Papuan provincial capital of Manokwari have set fire to the local parliament building after a demonstration against the arrest and detention of scores of Papuan students. A separatist movement has simmered for decades in Indonesia\u2019s easternmost provinces, Papua and West Papua, while Indonesian security forces have been frequently accused of human rights abuses. The spark for the latest unrest appears to have been the detention of scores of Papuan students in Surabaya, East Java, for bending a flagpole in front of a dormitory during the celebration of Indonesia\u2019s Independence Day on 17 August, according to Papuan activists. Police fired tear gas into dormitories before arresting 43 students, with officers calling the students \u201cmonkeys\u201d during the operation, Albert Mungguar, one of the activists said at a news conference on Sunday. Local media reported Papuan students were forced to barricade themselves in their dormitories, while a vigilante mob threw stones at the building while chanting, \u201ckick out Papuans\u201d and \u201cslaughter Papuans\u201d for hours. On Monday morning, Papuan protesters set fire to the legislative council building and blocked streets in the provincial capital of West Papua, Manokwari, by burning tyres and tree branches, deputy governor Mohamad Lakotani said. \u201cThe city centre, market, the port are next to the parliament building, as well as shopping centres.

Television footage showed a group of about 150 people marching on the streets in Manokwari, as well as footage of smoke billowing from a parliament building. Papua governor Lukas Enembe told broadcaster TVone that Papuans were angry because of \u201cthe extremely racist words by East Java people, the police and military\u201d. National police spokesman Dedi Prasetyo said security personnel were trying to calm the situation. \u201cNegotiations and communication are ongoing. Generally the situation is under control,\u201d Prasetyo, who is based in Jakarta, said by text message. A separate, peaceful protest of about 500 people was also underway in the town of Jayapura, the capital of Papua province, Papua police spokesman Ahmad Kamal said. The Papua and West Papua provinces, the resource-rich western part of the New Guinea island, makes up a former Dutch colony that was incorporated into Indonesia after a widely criticised UN-backed referendum in 1969. Exiled West Papuan independence leader Benny Wenda said peaceful protests by West Papuans and supporters across the Indonesian archipelago \u201chave been met with arrests, beatings and abuse given out by the Indonesian colonisers\u201d. \u201cEvery month, the world is given horrifying new evidence of the Indonesian state\u2019s violent intention to crush the West Papuan people\u2019s demand for freedom and self-determination.\u201d Human rights lawyer Veronica Koman said on Twitter the protests in Jayapura and Manokwari were the largest in years, with demonstrators marching through city streets, some waving the secessionist Morning Star flag. Last week, the Pacific Islands Forum bloc of countries called on Indonesia to finalise a long-promised visit to the Papuan provinces by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet.

Still, we toured its state rooms, took in tales of dragons and ghosts and discovered you can live there, in rented apartments. We had ice-cream from <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Wyndenwell/246617395467150\" title=\"\">Wyndenwell</a> on Front Street, and wandered to Bamburgh\u2019s magnificent beach for a stroll south to Seahouses.</p> <p>On the horizon were the Farne Islands, and their two lighthouses, one of which was home to Grace Darling, and whose story is affectingly told at <a href=\"https://rnli.org/find-my-nearest/museums/grace-darling-museum\" title=\"\">Bamburgh\u2019s RNLI museum</a> (admission free). Darling and her father, William, tended the Longstone lighthouse and on 7 September 1838 risked their lives in a storm to rescue passengers and crew from the stricken SS Forfarshire. They did so in a wooden boat not much longer than a family estate car. Grace\u2019s reward was a celebrity that meant constant intrusion from an admiring public, hastening her early demise from TB. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f50e604f0d296879dcb4f085d9eca1fcb58b88e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f50e604f0d296879dcb4f085d9eca1fcb58b88e7/0_70_3888_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boats in the harbour at Seahouses.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The harbour at Seahouses.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colin Weston/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bamburgh, with its stone-fronted houses, feels genteel, but Seahouses is a typical seaside town of fish and chips and arcades.

We wandered its ruins, before venturing along the River Coquet to visit its 15th-century hermitage. The boat ride there encapsulated, for me, the soulful heartbeat of this break \u2013 and this part of the world. Mark, at the ticket desk, had encouraged us not to miss the hermitage.

The route meandered through countryside and along the coast, passing villages we could have jumped off at to explore. Instead, we eavesdropped on walkers plotting routes from Embleton and Low Newton-by-the-Sea that would take them on St Oswald\u2019s Way. This 97-mile footpath runs from Holy Island to equally blessed-sounding Heavenfield, close to Hadrian\u2019s Wall in the south of the county. After an hour and 10 minutes on the bus, Bamburgh and its 11th-century castle (adult \u00a311.25, 5-16s \u00a35.50, family \u00a328) came into view. Mim deemed the castle not damaged-looking enough: she prefers them as ragged as possible. Still, we toured its state rooms, took in tales of dragons and ghosts and discovered you can live there, in rented apartments. We had ice-cream from Wyndenwell on Front Street, and wandered to Bamburgh\u2019s magnificent beach for a stroll south to Seahouses. On the horizon were the Farne Islands, and their two lighthouses, one of which was home to Grace Darling, and whose story is affectingly told at Bamburgh\u2019s RNLI museum (admission free). Darling and her father, William, tended the Longstone lighthouse and on 7 September 1838 risked their lives in a storm to rescue passengers and crew from the stricken SS Forfarshire. They did so in a wooden boat not much longer than a family estate car. Grace\u2019s reward was a celebrity that meant constant intrusion from an admiring public, hastening her early demise from TB. Bamburgh, with its stone-fronted houses, feels genteel, but Seahouses is a typical seaside town of fish and chips and arcades. And so our two-hour walk ended with a stop at Lewis\u2019s (haddock/cod and chips \u00a39) before taking the X18 bus back to Alnmouth. At first glance, Alnmouth had appeared scenic but sleepy. Yet its main road, Northumberland Street, is home to pubs including the Red Lion, the Tea Cosy Tearoom, the highly regarded Beaches restaurant, and a shop for hut supplies. There\u2019s even an ironic slice of village history, too: what used to be the home of its anti-smuggling officer in the 18th century is now the Aln Gift Shop. On our first afternoon we had waited on Alnmouth\u2019s Riverside Road for Adam from the Bike Shop in nearby Alnwick to deliver our hire bicycles (from \u00a325 a day, delivery/pickup available). We saw how the Aln estuary curved around the village to meet the sea, and looked over to Church Hill \u2013 the cross at its summit an evocative vision amid mottled skies. Adam\u2019s suggested route \u2013 an easy ride on Sustrans National Cycle Route 1 to Warkworth and its castle \u2013 proved a highlight. He also tipped Bertram\u2019s in Warkworth for lunch: its crab cakes (\u00a39.95) and apple crumble (\u00a34.95) fuelled our return ride to Alnmouth. Warkworth Castle (adult \u00a37.20, 5-17s \u00a34.30, family \u00a318.70), with its cast of custodians, including Harry Hotspur, was more to Mim\u2019s liking: grand, yet suitably broken-looking. We wandered its ruins, before venturing along the River Coquet to visit its 15th-century hermitage. The boat ride there encapsulated, for me, the soulful heartbeat of this break \u2013 and this part of the world. Mark, at the ticket desk, had encouraged us not to miss the hermitage. I asked why. \u201cThere\u2019s a moment of peace, midway across the river trip, that you should listen out for. It only lasts a couple of seconds but it\u2019s magical.

The Swedish funster Olaf Falafel was the winner, receiving the Dave funniest joke of the fringe award for this joke: \u201cI keep randomly shouting out \u2018Broccoli\u2019 and \u2018Cauliflower\u2019 \u2013 I think I might have Florets.\u201d Runnerup was Richard Stott with: \u201cSomeone stole my antidepressants. Whoever they are, I hope they\u2019re happy.\u201d Third was Milton Jones\u2019s attempt to extract some humour from the wreck of British politics: \u201cWhat\u2019s driving Brexit? From here it looks like it\u2019s probably the Duke of Edinburgh.\u201d Lunchtime read: Janey Godley, the barmaid turned standup queen Janey Godley has plotted a roundabout route to the top of standup comedy and as she prepares for a sold-out tour of Britain, she talks about how her tough upbringing and marriage into a criminal family forged her career. As a barmaid in one of Glasgow\u2019s roughest pubs, Godley honed the comic timing and expert crowd control essential for a stand-up career. But it was still a shock for many people in the industry when she started performing at the age of 35. She says: \u201cI spoke about my Ma being murdered, child abuse, gangsters. Back then, even comics were saying: \u2018You shouldn\u2019t talk about that.\u2019 But I\u2019m so glad I did.\u201d Now her targets are more political, with Boris Johnson and Donald Trump bearing the brunt of her highly popular online political voiceovers. Sport In the end it took an act of God to stop Jofra Archer. In the twilight of Sunday night the umpires decided that it was so dark that the Australian batsmen could not safely face him any more, leaving the second Test at Lord\u2019s to end as a draw. The fallout from the sight of the Steve Smith being felled by a bouncer has reignited the debate about whether sport polices the risks of concussion well enough. Mauricio Pochettino has described the decision to close the domestic summer transfer window in early August as a \u201cmassive mistake\u201d and claims he has even persuaded Tottenham\u2019s hard-nosed chairman, Daniel Levy, of the same thing. A week into Frank Lampard\u2019s competitive tenure at Chelsea, he still awaits his first win after a 1-1 draw with Leicester. And after buckling under the financial pressure of going professional, Millwall Lionesses are going it alone as the London City Lionesses. Business Donald Trump and his advisers have rejected fears that the US economy is heading for a recession. The US president said that while China was \u201ceating\u201d the pain from his trade tariffs, America was doing \u201ctremendously well\u201d. He added that the rest of the world was in recession, something which encouraged investors in Asia to push shares higher overnight in the hope of renewed stimulus from central banks. The FTSE100 is expected to rise this morning while the pound has crept up to $1.215 and \u20ac1.095. The papers Most papers agree that the Operation Yellowhammer revelations make the best story of the day. The Times says \u201cPM accuses ex-ministers over Brexit chaos leaks\u201d and the Telegraph makes it more explicit: \u201cNo-deal leak blamed on Hammond\u2019s Remainers\u201d. The Guardian says \u201cTory divisions over Brexit deepen amid row over no-deal dossier leak\u201d and the i has \u201cGove plays down leaked crisis plans for Brexit\u201d. The Metro goes with \u201cNo-deal leak slammed as project fear\u201d and the Express claims: \u201cProject fear bid to block Boris\u201d. Elsewhere the Mail leads with a health story \u2013 \u201cDoctors ordered to stop half-day closing\u201d \u2013 while the Mirror prefers crime \u2013 \u201cBulger\u2019s killer could be freed in weeks\u201d.

But despite dividends hitting an all-time quarterly high of $513.8bn (\u00a3423bn), the pace of year-on-year growth slowed to just 1.1%, compared with 14% this time last year. Analysts at the asset manager Janus Henderson, which collated the figures from the 1,200 largest listed companies, said this slowdown reflected a weakening global economy and the strength of the dollar. Financial and energy companies, largely oil and gas, increased their dividends faster than other sectors on an underlying basis, stripping out currency effects and one-off payouts. Banks and other financial companies handed out dividends that were 9.9% higher, and energy companies handed out an 6% increase. Investors in the fast-growing technology sector, who have seen their dividend income triple over 10 years, had to accept a rare decrease after cuts at Nokia and Samsung. Ben Lofthouse, head of global equity income at Janus Henderson, said: \u201cAt this stage in the economic cycle, we are seeing a moderation of dividend increases across a broad range of companies, and the number of cuts is on the rise, too. \u201cGlobal dividends have been growing very quickly over the last two years, however, so the slowdown we are now seeing is not a cause for concern.

Nestl\u00e9 paid out more than $7bn in dividends last year. Shareholders in British companies enjoyed an 8.6% rise in payouts, which reached a quarterly record of $35bn thanks to a $4.2bn boost from special dividends paid by Rio Tinto and Royal Bank of Scotland. The growth was in line with the global average of 5.3% once the impact of one-off payouts and the robust dollar were filtered out. The strength of the US currency means that dividends paid out in sterling and other struggling currencies are lower when reported in dollar terms. Investors scouring global markets for growth will have done well if they put their money in stocks from Japan, where payouts rose 10%, or emerging markets such as Brazil, China, India and Turkey, up 12.6% on average.

      "body": "<p>Janey Godley prods her chin lovingly, as she talks about ageing. \u201cI love putting up pictures on Twitter of me with no makeup. See every wrinkle,\u201d says the Glaswegian comedian, who is 58. For a glancing moment, she sounds a little awestruck. \u201cI survived rape, I survived my Ma being murdered, this is my face. If it offends you, don\u2019t look at it. I think other people should have that attitude.\u201d</p> <p>Godley is sitting in the kitchen of the elegant Edinburgh tenement flat she has rented for the duration of the fringe with her daughter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jul/14/fringe-edinburgh-festival--family-comic-dynasties\" title=\"\">Ashley Storrie</a>, a successful comic too, of whom her mum is glowingly proud. It is a biblically rainy day, and Godley has erected a shoe-changing station of plastic bags and a small stool at the front door, anxious to keep the carpets clean.</p> <p>With years of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2005/jun/12/comedy.biography\" title=\"\">five-star reviews and sold-out gigs behind her</a>, recent months have brought her a huge new audience as a result of the <a href=\"https://janeygodley.com/videos/\" title=\"\">political voiceovers she posts online</a>. Within hours of Boris Johnson visiting Nicola Sturgeon at her official residence last month, for instance, Godley had <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHUdCGWdsjE\" title=\"\">posted a video that articulated the first minister\u2019s imagined interior monologue</a> in an irritable Glaswegian accent. The prime minister had extended his arm to escort Sturgeon into her own home \u2013 in what many saw as a gesture of male entitlement \u2013 and Godley as Sturgeon is blunt: \u201cPut your arm down, ya arsehole, get in.\u201d The clip lasts for only a few seconds, and has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times.</p> <p>This month, Godley has brought the format to the Edinburgh fringe, where her shows are packed out in advance of a UK-wide tour. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that people like them so much,\u201d she says. \u201cBut then we don\u2019t have many satirical shows, and the ones we do have are like Have I Got News for You. I was the first working-class Scottish female comic ever to do it.\u201d She pauses. \u201c<em>Last year</em>. So even when we have satire, it\u2019s not relatable to everybody.\u201d</p> <p>Godley has strong opinions about Johnson and Trump. She came to the pro-independence cause during the 2014 referendum campaign, and is pragmatic about the prospects of an independent Scotland: \u201cI don\u2019t think its going to be a utopia, I think we\u2019re going to fuck up a lot of things, there will be mistakes. But what can be worse than Boris Johnson, who is a Poundland Donald Trump?\u201d</p> <p>She believes that Johnson\u2019s premiership and the \u201cshambles\u201d of Brexit is causing many of those who voted against independence in 2014 to reassess: \u201cPeople are like: \u2018This is tribal, this is the flag, this is the Queen, we love the union.\u2019 Then they see their benefits affected, their taxes, that they can\u2019t get insulin, and then people change their minds.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"59f19d2f6a8ad3ac8854e11833adce84788ca156\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59f19d2f6a8ad3ac8854e11833adce84788ca156/0_135_2580_1548/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pulling no punches \u2026 Godley on stage at Edinburgh, 2005.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pulling no punches \u2026 Godley on stage at Edinburgh, 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As Godley rattles through the details of her \u201cdodgy background\u201d, there are elements of slapstick, and she is not coy about a pitch-black punchline. When she tells me that the uncle who raped her as a child was found dead in his bed last year, she fixes me with an even gaze. \u201cAll the men that fuck me about die alone. Weird, eh?\u201d</p> <p>She is unsentimental about experiences that must have been painful, brutal and frightening. But she is also scrupulously clear about where responsibility lies: it\u2019s not her shame, she reiterates several times.</p> <p>The youngest of four, Godley was raised by an alcoholic father and a chaotic, debt-prone mother in the East End of Glasgow. She was systematically abused by an uncle throughout her childhood, left school without any qualifications and was married at 19 to the son of a local gangster. Her mother died in 1982, when Godley was 21, murdered, her daughter believes, by her violent boyfriend, who was never charged by the police despite her family\u2019s protestations.</p> <p>\u201cI had nits, scabies, we were poor,\u201d she says bluntly of her childhood. \u201cI remember eating out of bins and being a teenager with dirty clothes. But I was bright and I loved reading, so I had the chance to escape. And I\u2019m not ashamed of it, because it wasn\u2019t my fault.\u201d</p> <p>That is one of the reasons she does the free fringe (her gigs have an honesty bucket at the exit). \u201cI love the fact that people who are pure skint can come through from Glasgow and see a free show, because it\u2019s a very elite business.\u201d</p> <p>What is blazingly obvious, listening to her life story, is the way Godley has taken direct action, with great courage, often in the face of male power. Aged 12, she threatened her uncle with a red-hot poker: \u201cHe backed off because he\u2019d never been confronted before.\u201d As an adult, she took him to court, along with her sister, whom he had similarly abused, and secured a conviction. After years of bullying, she walked out on her gangster in-laws and forged a successful international career \u201cdoing something I\u2019d never seen anyone like me doing\u201d.</p> <p>Godley is never lost for words, but she pauses here for a millisecond when I ask her about this. \u201cWhen Ashley meets members of my extended family, she\u2019s like: \u2018HOW?\u2019 I don\u2019t know what made me different and I know there <em>is</em> something different.\u201d</p> <p>Of the sexual abuse, she says: \u201cWhen I was a teenager and [my husband and I] were first having sex \u2013 no, he\u2019s not getting to take that off me either. I made a concerted decision to never let it affect me. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s psychotic or wrong, but it\u2019s what I did. That cunt doesn\u2019t get to decide how my life is \u2013 and that\u2019s been my mantra.\u201d</p> <p>To describe Godley\u2019s route to comedy as unusual is an understatement. Critics who describe her standup material \u2013 which embraces child abuse and murder \u2013 as \u201cunique\u201d do so for good reason. Godley spent her 20s running a pub in Calton, an area regularly cited as <a href=\"https://www.gcph.co.uk/latest/news/555_life_expectancy_in_calton-no_longer_54\" title=\"\">having the lowest life expectancy for men in the whole of the UK</a>, with her husband. The pub belonged to George Storrie, a notorious criminal patriarch with seven sons, six of whom deeply resented Godley and her steadfast refusal to keep quiet.</p> <p>The young couple surprised even themselves in their ability to run a business well: \u201cWe were proper young grafters,\u201d she says fondly. \u201cWe didn\u2019t smoke or drink, we paid tax, put our daughter through a private school. I wanted her to get an education because I never got one.\u201d</p> <p>But after her father-in-law\u2019s death, the police raided his property \u2013 \u201cthey wouldn\u2019t come when George was alive\u201d \u2013 where Godley\u2019s family and several other brothers were living. They found guns and weapons secreted about the place: Godley and her husband were put in prison for the night, but let out, \u201cbecause we could prove the guns weren\u2019t ours\u201d.</p> <p>Then a dispute over the running of the family pub, combined with already toxic fraternal relations, pushed Godley and her husband to walk out of their home one night, with their daughter, the cat and some schoolbooks, never to return. While the brothers\u2019 mutual chaos has continued across the decades, the couple have not had further contact with them for 27 years.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWlzFoxyDq8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AWlzFoxyDq8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Godley remembers her eldest brother-in-law telling her as she left: \u2018You\u2019re fuck all but a barmaid.\u2019 \u201cI turned round and said: \u2018I\u2019m not your barmaid.\u2019 Her eyes glitter with delight. \u201cI played a barmaid in the film Wild Rose [released last year], so yes, I am a barmaid, but I\u2019m a Hollywood barmaid!\u201d</p> <p>The family moved into temporary accommodation. It was terrifying, she says: \u201cWe had no transferable skills.\u201d But that wasn\u2019t entirely true: as a barmaid in one of Glasgow\u2019s roughest pubs, Godley had honed the comic timing and expert crowd control essential for a stand-up career. Having already excelled at open-mic nights, she progressed quickly on the comedy circuit.</p> <p>It was the mid-90s, she reminds me, when \u201calternative\u201d comedy was very much the domain of \u201cstudent boys in nice jeans and funny haircuts\u201d. She rolls her eyes: \u201cI saw a lot of cock back then.\u201d At one show, a couple of male comedians came out naked, carrying a plank of wood, \u201cand the promoters were like: \u2018This is genius.\u2019 And I was like: \u2018This is NOT genius, I don\u2019t understand any of this.\u2019 And the audience weren\u2019t laughing, they were bemused. I realised in that moment there were two types of comedy: comedians who people called \u2018genius\u2019, who only the promoters laughed at, and comedians the audience loved, and the promoters didn\u2019t. I went on after them, did straight standup, and the audience laughed.</p> <p>\u201cIt was quite a shock to have a working-class, older woman \u2013 I was 35 and a mum \u2013 do this, and it got a few backs up.\u201d But promoters were also suspicious because she was talking about subjects that people didn\u2019t normally make jokes about.</p> <p>\u201cI spoke about my Ma being murdered, child abuse, gangsters. Back then, even comics were saying: \u2018You shouldn\u2019t talk about that.\u2019 But I\u2019m so glad I did. The amount of people that came up to me and said: \u2018I was abused and I\u2019ve never laughed before.\u2019 One of the most important things about comedy is nobody gets to tell you what you can joke about, as long as you\u2019re punching up and not punching down.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"89d218646e2e791c3921a52381e42b36507bdbe9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89d218646e2e791c3921a52381e42b36507bdbe9/0_27_4480_2688/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Godley adapts her Donald Trump protest placard and high-fives a police officer, 14 July 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Godley adapts her Donald Trump protest placard and high-fives a police officer, 14 July 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The voiceovers aren\u2019t her first brush with online fame. The day after the UK voted to leave the EU, the presumptive Republican nominee <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/24/donald-trump-hails-eu-referendum-result-as-he-arrives-in-uk\" title=\"\">Donald Trump flew in to visit his golf course at Turnberry</a>, on the south-west coast of Scotland. Fuelled by righteous anger at the referendum result, and at Trump himself \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019ve all met that man in the pub, that checks a woman out as he talks and then moves on if he\u2019s not interested, then tells you that women\u2019s issues don\u2019t matter\u201d \u2013 Godley hand-wrote a succinct protest slogan and headed for the coast. The photograph of a small but defiant woman, <a href=\"https://janeygodley.com/2016/06/28/welcomed-trump-scotland/\" title=\"\">holding an A3 sign reading \u201cTrump is a cunt\u201d</a>, surrounded by police, went viral.</p> <p>\u201cI think half the world was shocked I used that word,\u201d she says, \u201cbut there are worse words. Food bank is worse.\u201d When Godley returned to Turnberry to protest against Trump\u2019s visit as US president in 2018, she adapted the sign to read \u201cTrump is a runt\u201d with a strategically placed hand.</p> <p>The voiceovers were not a big career plan, she insists, but she enjoys the comedy potential of the cameraphone: \u201cI\u2019m the opposite of what everybody says about older women: I\u2019m a tech whiz. I [voiced] Theresa May\u2019s resignation speech in a Virgin trains toilet.\u201d</p> <p>She has depicted May trying to persuade Jeremy Corbyn to join a minoge (a Scottish savings club), and begging Sturgeon for her Netflix sign-in, before heading over for the summer to her Spanish caravan with Isa MacNamee and all the Sandras. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JaneyGodley/status/1156498256714752000\" title=\"\">Arlene Foster is not impressed</a>: \u201cBig Theresa\u2019s pure steaming over in Torremolinos. She\u2019s just joined the Snapchat group, Face-timed me at two in the morning singing Abba, as if I don\u2019t have enough to do!\u201d</p> <p>The references in the voiceovers \u2013 the savings club, Pippa Dee clothing parties, which auntie last borrowed the soup pot \u2013 are emphatically local to the west of Scotland, but Godley has a theory about why they travel so well: \u201cThese are really troubling times, and folk want to hark back to something with a sense of community. The soup pot is the very definition of that. People in America, Venezuela, Australia have all written to me and said it doesn\u2019t matter what culture you belong to, whenever there\u2019s a death, a birth, a homecoming, people get out the big soup pot. So that is a global icon of community.\u201d</p> <p>She is bullish about requests to subtitle her broad Scots delivery: \u201cI say, no, learn my accent. If you can learn to read Shakespeare and there\u2019s a Burns club in every country, you can understand my accent.\u201d Has she ever been confronted by one of her voiceover subjects? Politicians have written to her privately and asked \u201cCan you do me?\u201d, she twinkles, but refuses to disclose any further. Yes, she has been told that Sturgeon has seen them. \u201cApparently she finds them funny,\u201d she says with the deliberate vagueness of someone who knows all too well that she does. But Godley insists they have never met, or spoken. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to be photographed with her because I\u2019ve got such a dodgy background that I don\u2019t want to infect her with it. I don\u2019t want to be pals with any politician.\u201d</p> <p>Godley has received death threats for her opposition to Trump, and so is well aware of the poison welling online. But the great thing about social media, she says, \u201cis that people speak out. Before, if you stood in a pub and spoke about domestic violence, you\u2019d be shut down in a minute.\u201d For her mother\u2019s generation, it was normal to see a woman walking down the road with two black eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s laws that have changed. In Scotland, you can\u2019t even gaslight a woman and rightly so \u2013 there\u2019s refuges, places women can go.\u201d</p> <p>There is a strong impression that Godley \u2013 who suffers fools gladly only to the extent that they provide her with another laugh line \u2013 has found her playground on Twitter. \u201cHas Twitter changed my life? It has. I make a joke about it on stage: \u2018My husband loves it because I used to argue with him \u2026\u2019 I treat it like daily life \u2013 if one person says you\u2019re not funny, you don\u2019t have to find me funny.

While the brothers\u2019 mutual chaos has continued across the decades, the couple have not had further contact with them for 27 years. Godley remembers her eldest brother-in-law telling her as she left: \u2018You\u2019re fuck all but a barmaid.\u2019 \u201cI turned round and said: \u2018I\u2019m not your barmaid.\u2019 Her eyes glitter with delight. \u201cI played a barmaid in the film Wild Rose [released last year], so yes, I am a barmaid, but I\u2019m a Hollywood barmaid!\u201d The family moved into temporary accommodation. It was terrifying, she says: \u201cWe had no transferable skills.\u201d But that wasn\u2019t entirely true: as a barmaid in one of Glasgow\u2019s roughest pubs, Godley had honed the comic timing and expert crowd control essential for a stand-up career. Having already excelled at open-mic nights, she progressed quickly on the comedy circuit. It was the mid-90s, she reminds me, when \u201calternative\u201d comedy was very much the domain of \u201cstudent boys in nice jeans and funny haircuts\u201d. She rolls her eyes: \u201cI saw a lot of cock back then.\u201d At one show, a couple of male comedians came out naked, carrying a plank of wood, \u201cand the promoters were like: \u2018This is genius.\u2019 And I was like: \u2018This is NOT genius, I don\u2019t understand any of this.\u2019 And the audience weren\u2019t laughing, they were bemused. I realised in that moment there were two types of comedy: comedians who people called \u2018genius\u2019, who only the promoters laughed at, and comedians the audience loved, and the promoters didn\u2019t. I went on after them, did straight standup, and the audience laughed. \u201cIt was quite a shock to have a working-class, older woman \u2013 I was 35 and a mum \u2013 do this, and it got a few backs up.\u201d But promoters were also suspicious because she was talking about subjects that people didn\u2019t normally make jokes about. \u201cI spoke about my Ma being murdered, child abuse, gangsters. Back then, even comics were saying: \u2018You shouldn\u2019t talk about that.\u2019 But I\u2019m so glad I did. The amount of people that came up to me and said: \u2018I was abused and I\u2019ve never laughed before.\u2019 One of the most important things about comedy is nobody gets to tell you what you can joke about, as long as you\u2019re punching up and not punching down.\u201d The voiceovers aren\u2019t her first brush with online fame. The day after the UK voted to leave the EU, the presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump flew in to visit his golf course at Turnberry, on the south-west coast of Scotland. Fuelled by righteous anger at the referendum result, and at Trump himself \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019ve all met that man in the pub, that checks a woman out as he talks and then moves on if he\u2019s not interested, then tells you that women\u2019s issues don\u2019t matter\u201d \u2013 Godley hand-wrote a succinct protest slogan and headed for the coast. The photograph of a small but defiant woman, holding an A3 sign reading \u201cTrump is a cunt\u201d, surrounded by police, went viral. \u201cI think half the world was shocked I used that word,\u201d she says, \u201cbut there are worse words. Food bank is worse.\u201d When Godley returned to Turnberry to protest against Trump\u2019s visit as US president in 2018, she adapted the sign to read \u201cTrump is a runt\u201d with a strategically placed hand. The voiceovers were not a big career plan, she insists, but she enjoys the comedy potential of the cameraphone: \u201cI\u2019m the opposite of what everybody says about older women: I\u2019m a tech whiz. I [voiced] Theresa May\u2019s resignation speech in a Virgin trains toilet.\u201d She has depicted May trying to persuade Jeremy Corbyn to join a minoge (a Scottish savings club), and begging Sturgeon for her Netflix sign-in, before heading over for the summer to her Spanish caravan with Isa MacNamee and all the Sandras. Arlene Foster is not impressed: \u201cBig Theresa\u2019s pure steaming over in Torremolinos. She\u2019s just joined the Snapchat group, Face-timed me at two in the morning singing Abba, as if I don\u2019t have enough to do!\u201d The references in the voiceovers \u2013 the savings club, Pippa Dee clothing parties, which auntie last borrowed the soup pot \u2013 are emphatically local to the west of Scotland, but Godley has a theory about why they travel so well: \u201cThese are really troubling times, and folk want to hark back to something with a sense of community. The soup pot is the very definition of that. People in America, Venezuela, Australia have all written to me and said it doesn\u2019t matter what culture you belong to, whenever there\u2019s a death, a birth, a homecoming, people get out the big soup pot. So that is a global icon of community.\u201d She is bullish about requests to subtitle her broad Scots delivery: \u201cI say, no, learn my accent. If you can learn to read Shakespeare and there\u2019s a Burns club in every country, you can understand my accent.\u201d Has she ever been confronted by one of her voiceover subjects? Politicians have written to her privately and asked \u201cCan you do me?\u201d, she twinkles, but refuses to disclose any further. Yes, she has been told that Sturgeon has seen them. \u201cApparently she finds them funny,\u201d she says with the deliberate vagueness of someone who knows all too well that she does. But Godley insists they have never met, or spoken. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to be photographed with her because I\u2019ve got such a dodgy background that I don\u2019t want to infect her with it. I don\u2019t want to be pals with any politician.\u201d Godley has received death threats for her opposition to Trump, and so is well aware of the poison welling online. But the great thing about social media, she says, \u201cis that people speak out. Before, if you stood in a pub and spoke about domestic violence, you\u2019d be shut down in a minute.\u201d For her mother\u2019s generation, it was normal to see a woman walking down the road with two black eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s laws that have changed. In Scotland, you can\u2019t even gaslight a woman and rightly so \u2013 there\u2019s refuges, places women can go.\u201d There is a strong impression that Godley \u2013 who suffers fools gladly only to the extent that they provide her with another laugh line \u2013 has found her playground on Twitter. \u201cHas Twitter changed my life? It has. I make a joke about it on stage: \u2018My husband loves it because I used to argue with him \u2026\u2019 I treat it like daily life \u2013 if one person says you\u2019re not funny, you don\u2019t have to find me funny. My tour sells out.\u201d For details of Janey Godley\u2019s upcoming tour, go to janeygodley.com",

With the climate emergency beyond doubt and the car falling into cultural disrepute, why is it that beyond Britain\u2019s big cities our railway services are such an inconsistent, Balkanised mess, and that after a decade of austerity public transport is in such a parlous state? Once you have been reminded that such tiny Welsh places as Llangadog, Ffairfach and Knucklas have railway stations while large-ish population centres such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_towns_in_England_without_a_railway_station\" title=\"\">Dunstable, Abingdon, Brecon and Wisbech no longer do</a>, the answer is surely not to think about shutting the former\u2019s limited train services down but to restore the latter places to a proper public transport network.

If thousands of stations were so stupidly axed when we believed in a car-based future, belatedly starting to reverse that huge blunder ought to be a matter of urgency. Clearly, to move away from the failings of the current system and begin such a revolution, a large measure of public ownership and control of both trains and infrastructure will be imperative, though not of the old-fashioned kind. Why not embrace a system of transport devolution, whereby small lines could be run by some of the organisations on the ground?</p> <p>Sceptical voices will tell us that such dreams will never be realistic. But if we can sideline every ounce of economic sense in pursuit of leaving the EU and invite disaster, why is dependable, democratic, green transport for all such an impossible idea? Perhaps, when Britain has eventually found some way of accepting that it is located in northern Europe and dealing with modernity, a positive legacy of Brexit will be the death of illusory policy limits and a realisation that there are no end of things we can do if we simply decide to. As I passed through elegant Welsh stations festooned with flowers, past mountains and through a tunnel or two, the point felt unanswerable; now I am back at home, it still does.</p> <p>\u2022 John Harris is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Perhaps, when Britain has eventually found some way of accepting that it is located in northern Europe and dealing with modernity, a positive legacy of Brexit will be the death of illusory policy limits and a realisation that there are no end of things we can do if we simply decide to. As I passed through elegant Welsh stations festooned with flowers, past mountains and through a tunnel or two, the point felt unanswerable; now I am back at home, it still does. \u2022 John Harris is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "The National Trust for Scotland has warned that a large salmon farm beside the Hebridean island of Canna could destroy the island\u2019s culture and wildlife. The trust, Scotland\u2019s largest heritage charity, said the proposed fish farm posed unacceptable risks to the sea and the birdlife around the tiny island, and would put its booming tourism economy under great strain. Mowi, the world\u2019s largest aquaculture company, has tabled outline plans with Highland council to install eight super-sized fish pens close to Canna\u2019s shoreline, to be stocked with 2,500 tonnes of organic salmon. The NTS, which was given the island by the Gaelic folklorist John Lorne Campbell in 1981, has tabled a formal objection to Mowi\u2019s proposals, accusing it of submitting flawed, incomplete evidence about the site\u2019s environmental and economic impact.

The NTS estimates it would still discharge as much organic waste each year \u2013 faeces, uneaten fishmeal and dead fish \u2013 as a town the size of Dumfries or Lichfield (population about 35,000). Stuart Brooks, the trust\u2019s head of conservation and policy, said it had a duty to protect Canna\u2019s cultural and natural heritage. The island and its surrounding seas are protected by six wildlife and geological designations, including a marine protected area, with six other protected areas nearby. \u201cBased on the information provided by Mowi so far about their fish farm proposals, we have no confidence that their plans would not undermine, if not destroy, the very things that make Canna so important,\u201d he said. \u201cIn all conscience, we cannot support Mowi\u2019s proposals.\u201d An island with a population of 18, Canna is famed for Lorne Campbell\u2019s large Gaelic archive and for its archaeology and wildlife, which includes the rare Canna mouse, a subspecies of fieldmouse. The NTS and the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland spent \u00a3600,000 eradicating brown rats from the island 10 years ago, in part to protect the Canna mouse but also to bring the island\u2019s Manx shearwater population back from the brink of extinction. The trust warns there is a \u201cserious risk\u201d that rats will be brought back by Mowi\u2019s service vessels. Mowi said it would strive to stop that happening and would pay for an eradication programme if its vessels were to blame. One of four inhabited islands known as the Small Isles, along with Eigg, Rum and Muck, Canna has suffered a long-term population decline and several failed attempts by the NTS to attract new residents. The trust handed control of its regeneration strategy to the islanders in 2017. Its economy is heavily dependent on summer tourism, subsistence farming and the NTS warden and archivists working at Canna House, the home shared by Lorne Campbell and his wife Margaret Fay Shaw, a musician and photographer. Mowi, a Norwegian-owned multinational, said the farm would need 10 staff and would boost Canna\u2019s economy. Some will be based there part-time, but Mowi has offered some jobs to islanders, who are still mulling over the proposal. It already has two salmon farms off Rum and Muck that employ local people, but the NTS said the Canna site, which will cover 16,000 sq metres and sit close to the picturesque harbour, will deter tourists, cruise ships and yachts, reducing the island\u2019s main source of income. Mowi said the Canna scheme would allow it to close down two sites on the Scottish mainland close to sensitive wild salmon habitats, including one at Loch Ewe blamed for devastating wild trout stocks at Loch Maree nearby. The company has promised all its Scottish sites will be accredited by the Aquaculture Stewardship Council, which has tighter rules on chemical use and marine pollution, by 2020, in response to attacks from MSPs and environmentalists on the industry\u2019s environmental record. Mowi argues an organic farm would have a lower impact, partly because the Canna site will be exposed to strong tides and open sea. NTS challenged that assertion, since the Soil Association, the organic accreditation and rule-making body, still allowed toxic chemicals to be used twice a year.

      "bodyText": "An official from the Department of Home Affairs who quit his job in the refugee processing area to argue publicly for an overhaul of Australia\u2019s border protection regime has warned abandoning the medevac procedures would be \u201cdisastrous\u201d. Shaun Hanns, a home affairs departmental official until last October, has used a submission to a Senate inquiry into the medevac repeal to implore senators to persist with the current medical evacuations system as \u201cthe first step in an attempt to reform the system so that it is not only effective but as humane as possible whilst maintaining that effectiveness\u201d. Hanns said the medevac procedures actively demonstrate that Australia\u2019s overall deterrence regime \u201cneed not rely on a logic of cruelty in order to be effective\u201d \u2013 which is a break through in policy development in border protection that should not be lightly discarded. \u201cThe experience of the past six months shows that there is significantly more leeway to change the system without undermining border protection than previously assumed,\u201d Hanns said in a submission seen by Guardian Australia. He has told the inquiry it is important to remember that people who have been transferred to Manus or Nauru are presently not eligible for any visa in Australia, and \u201canyone genuinely considered by the minister to be a risk to the community will, quite simply, never make it out of held detention\u201d. \u201cGiven the above, it\u2019s entirely unclear how the current policy settings increase risk to the community in any way\u201d. The former independent Kerryn Phelps has also appealed to Senate kingmakers not to repeal the medevac procedures. She warns in her submission scrapping the current law will mean a return to the \u201cslow, unpredictable and dangerous\u201d transfer system for asylum seekers in need of urgent medical attention. Phelps tells senators if they support the Morrison government\u2019s efforts to dismantle the system, \u201cthe transfer of sick refugees will again be in the hands of politicians and bureaucrats, and we will return to the previous situation, when court orders and legal intervention were required to ensure critically sick people received the medical treatment they needed\u201d. The medevac procedures, which give clinicians a greater say in medical transfers of asylum seekers, were legislated in the last parliament with the support of crossbenchers, Labor and the Greens at the time Scott Morrison governed in minority. The change was opposed by the Coalition. In her submission, Phelps argued crossbenchers pursued the overhaul because the \u201cevidence was clear that an urgent medical solution was needed\u201d and the medical transfer system was \u201cbroken\u201d. She said 12 people have died in offshore processing, and it was clear when she assessed the expert evidence that the medical facilities on Manus Island and Nauru were inadequate for the needs of people in offshore detention. She said a Queensland coronial inquest into the death of an asylum seeker in 2018 found the death was preventable, and was due to the failure of the Australian government to provide appropriate medical treatment and transfer to specialist care. Prior to the medevac regime, Phelps said the only pathway for sick people to access urgent medical care was via legal intervention, which was \u201ctime-consuming and costly\u201d and rarely successful for people on Manus Island. \u201cThere was a real fear from doctors and other healthcare professionals that more people would die before they received appropriate medical treatment,\u201d the former MP said in the submission. \u201cIt was obvious that the only way to guarantee an appropriate and timely process, driven by clinical rather than political considerations, was through legislation.\u201d A separate submission from the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre said the medevac regime had enabled 110 people suffering from physical and mental health conditions to access urgent medical care in Australia. \u201cPrior to the passing of the medevac law, sick refugees were waiting an average of at least two years, and some for up to five years, for medical transfer after it had been recommended by the government\u2019s appointed doctors, and the majority of transfers were the result of legal intervention,\u201d the submission said. It said in 2018, approximately 150 legal matters were run by over 100 pro bono lawyers, resulting in 50 applications filed, and the balance settled out of court. \u201cThere have been 12 deaths in immigration detention offshore, many for treatable illnesses, and the medevac law ensures there is no longer political interference with the transfer system.\u201d The submission noted that in the majority of cases (around 80%), the minister had agreed in the first instance with the initial medical recommendation for transfer. \u201cIn only a handful of cases the independent health advisory panel has overturned the decision of the minister, and in the majority of cases has upheld the minister\u2019s decision.\u201d It said none of the cases refused for transfer under the medevac regime had been on security grounds. The Morrison government has succeeded in getting the medevac repeal through the lower house, but the proposal cannot proceed to a vote in the Senate until later this year, because the repeal is subject to an inquiry by the Senate\u2019s legal and constitutional affairs committee. One of the key kingmakers in the Senate, the Centre Alliance crossbench senator Stirling Griff, has already put the Morrison government on notice that repealing the medical evacuations bill would \u201csully the relationship\u201d between himself and the Coalition. On current indications, the government will not succeed in repealing the regime unless the Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie supports the move. Lambie is yet to signal her disposition. Phelps has appealed to Lambie to take her time and assess the expert evidence presented through the Senate inquiry. Phelps told Guardian Australia on Monday she spent many hours when she held the seat of Wentworth listening to experts working with asylum seekers and medical practitioners, \u201cand it didn\u2019t take long to discover a catastrophic situation had been created\u201d. The independent health advisory panel overseeing medevac procedures has reported there were 73 admissions covering 43 people at the RPC medical centre on Nauru in the first quarter of 2019, with \u201cthe majority\u201d relating to mental health conditions. The first quarterly report of the independent panel, obtained by Labor under an order for the production of documents in the Senate, found that in addition to the 73 admissions, with stays ranging between one and 44 days, there were 8,260 medical consultations provided to people on Nauru in the quarter \u2013 mostly for mental health problems.",

The challenge set was not to change our tastes, just to ditch the plastic parts of them.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Opening my cupboard to sacks of flour was heartening precisely to the point I discovered shitting mice trashed the lot</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Our advantages are many. We live in a regional community that still has market gardens, local producers and specialty shops. We have the vegetable garden, our own fruit trees. I work from home, I\u2019m good at craft, I can cook, I make my own sauces and jams. Reducing our plastic use meant rejecting the sole local supplier of store-bought bread, so I taught myself to bake my own. I replaced plastic-packaged cola with one that\u2019s homemade. Already, instead of a premixed cleaning spray, I ferment lemon scraps in vinegar for a month and spray that around.</p> <p>But these simple replacements have a petrochemical trail. Locally, vinegar comes only in plastic. The spray bottle is plastic. Maybe the container the bread yeast comes in contains plastic; packaging that seems innocuous \u2013 from <a href=\"https://www.therogueginger.com/2019/06/sneaky-plastics-in-our-food-packaging.html\">teabags to tin cans</a> \u2013 often does \u2026 and pretty soon I was too damn depressed to look closely.</p> <p>Plastic is ubiquitous. All the seedlings for my garden are sold in plastic pots. At the local organic vegetable market, the harried grocer displays capsicums, cauliflower and potatoes naked, but sells them in fastened plastic bags. This is an improvement on the supermarket, where the \u201corganic\u201d vegetables are sold as bricks from a styrofoam and cling-film plastic wall. At the local butcher, I asked if they could wrap the sausages in butcher\u2019s paper instead of plastic. \u201cNah, we don\u2019t use it,\u201d she responded, as if I\u2019d come in asking for a new wheel for my penny farthing or for a crank to start up my car.</p> <p>Dairy was a disastrous prospect. The supermarket sells seven brands of cream; they\u2019re all made locally \u2013 and every single one comes in a plastic container. I ordered silicon containers to freeze leftovers in \u2013 they arrived padded with plastic bubbles. A tin pot of cream deodorant came wrapped in plastic security stickers. Imaginative schemes for waste minimisation were met with pre-emptive defeat; the attempt to cater a dinner party from a medieval (!) cookbook demanded ingredients that only came plasticised.</p> <p>I tried to reenact what I remembered of my nanna\u2019s depression-mindset, zero-waste home \u2026 but no victory over plastic ever seemed unpunished. Cardboard-boxed Velvet soap is cheap, cleans everything \u2026 and, apparently, <a href=\"https://gippslandunwrapped.com/2016/08/03/palm-oil-free-the-hidden-benefit-of-reducing-packaging/\">contains palm oil</a>. Opening my cupboard doors onto paper sacks of flours and sugar was heartening precisely to the point I discovered that some shitting mice had trashed the lot.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jul/14/five-ways-to-reduce-plastic-in-the-bathroom\">Five ways to reduce plastic in the bathroom</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Of this last catastrophe, my partner\u2019s mother made the gentle point that if the purchase \u2013 of, say, plastic storage containers - is for lifetime use, then it can\u2019t be considered plastic \u201cwaste\u201d. But as every plastic lid, bag and bottle reminds, every piece of it is with all of us for <a href=\"https://www.postconsumers.com/2011/10/31/how-long-does-it-take-a-plastic-bottle-to-biodegrade/\">more than a lifetime</a>.</p> <p>Yes, there are people whose skills in planning combine with their access to resources and they manage waste down to a monthly thimbleful. But not only are the majority of us incapable of their thrift, their example can\u2019t just magic the plastic away.</p> <p>What I learned from my month of privileged, cashed-up western failure is that it\u2019s going to take the regulation of plastic production, distribution and supply by global governments to make anywhere \u201cplastic-free\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/banning-plastic-bags-is-a-start-but-it-s-still-not-enough-20190621-p51zyr.html\">Single-use-plastic-bag bans are not enough</a>. <a href=\"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/more-recycling-wont-solve-plastic-pollution/\">Recycling is not enough</a>.</p> <p>Governments must legislate to enforce <a href=\"https://www.innovationexcellence.com/blog/2018/07/02/13-plastic-packaging-alternatives/\">the use of alternatives</a>, starting yesterday.

Had I stuck to this plan \u2013 despite deliberate and even desperate efforts to excise plastic waste from my life \u2013 I\u2019d now be limping around like Skinner, from Howard Barker\u2019s The Castle. She\u2019s a witch punished for a murder by having her victim\u2019s corpse strapped to her back. Even without the bag, my plastic use weighs heavily on my conscience. Anti-plastic advocates often cite a visual moment of realisation of the size of the plastic problem. There\u2019s an infamously life-changing photograph of an albatross chick with its stomach split from swallowed bottle lids, another of a seahorse with a Q-tip curled into its tail. A year ago, I discovered 30 separate bits of plastic waste in what is supposed to be my organic vegetable garden, and I\u2019ve been minimising my plastic waste ever since. I bought the books \u2013 the excellent Waste Not by Erin Rhoads and Less Stuff by Lindsay Miles are encouraging, Australian and familiar. I\u2019m a beeswax-wraps and bamboo-toothbrush user, I \u201cmake do and mend\u201d my clothes, I store bulk-bought snacks in glass jars. But there are no illusions in our house that taking mere individual responsibility for what is a collective problem can ever solve it \u2013 one household makes negligible difference when 340 million global tons of plastic are produced in a single year. The enraging history of plastic also includes how its corporate makers avoided bans and regulation by aggressively mobilising anti-litter campaigns in the 1980s \u2013 a sleight-of-hand blaming of citizens for the garbage mountains that their own companies were pumping out. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning But my partner accepted my logic that, as activists, an ongoing awareness of where and how we use plastic would attune us to thinking through what a policy response to the plastic crisis might be. The challenge set was not to change our tastes, just to ditch the plastic parts of them. Our advantages are many. We live in a regional community that still has market gardens, local producers and specialty shops. We have the vegetable garden, our own fruit trees. I work from home, I\u2019m good at craft, I can cook, I make my own sauces and jams. Reducing our plastic use meant rejecting the sole local supplier of store-bought bread, so I taught myself to bake my own. I replaced plastic-packaged cola with one that\u2019s homemade. Already, instead of a premixed cleaning spray, I ferment lemon scraps in vinegar for a month and spray that around. But these simple replacements have a petrochemical trail. Locally, vinegar comes only in plastic. The spray bottle is plastic. Maybe the container the bread yeast comes in contains plastic; packaging that seems innocuous \u2013 from teabags to tin cans \u2013 often does \u2026 and pretty soon I was too damn depressed to look closely. Plastic is ubiquitous. All the seedlings for my garden are sold in plastic pots. At the local organic vegetable market, the harried grocer displays capsicums, cauliflower and potatoes naked, but sells them in fastened plastic bags. This is an improvement on the supermarket, where the \u201corganic\u201d vegetables are sold as bricks from a styrofoam and cling-film plastic wall. At the local butcher, I asked if they could wrap the sausages in butcher\u2019s paper instead of plastic. \u201cNah, we don\u2019t use it,\u201d she responded, as if I\u2019d come in asking for a new wheel for my penny farthing or for a crank to start up my car. Dairy was a disastrous prospect. The supermarket sells seven brands of cream; they\u2019re all made locally \u2013 and every single one comes in a plastic container. I ordered silicon containers to freeze leftovers in \u2013 they arrived padded with plastic bubbles. A tin pot of cream deodorant came wrapped in plastic security stickers. Imaginative schemes for waste minimisation were met with pre-emptive defeat; the attempt to cater a dinner party from a medieval (!) cookbook demanded ingredients that only came plasticised. I tried to reenact what I remembered of my nanna\u2019s depression-mindset, zero-waste home \u2026 but no victory over plastic ever seemed unpunished. Cardboard-boxed Velvet soap is cheap, cleans everything \u2026 and, apparently, contains palm oil. Opening my cupboard doors onto paper sacks of flours and sugar was heartening precisely to the point I discovered that some shitting mice had trashed the lot. Of this last catastrophe, my partner\u2019s mother made the gentle point that if the purchase \u2013 of, say, plastic storage containers - is for lifetime use, then it can\u2019t be considered plastic \u201cwaste\u201d. But as every plastic lid, bag and bottle reminds, every piece of it is with all of us for more than a lifetime. Yes, there are people whose skills in planning combine with their access to resources and they manage waste down to a monthly thimbleful. But not only are the majority of us incapable of their thrift, their example can\u2019t just magic the plastic away. What I learned from my month of privileged, cashed-up western failure is that it\u2019s going to take the regulation of plastic production, distribution and supply by global governments to make anywhere \u201cplastic-free\u201d. Single-use-plastic-bag bans are not enough. Recycling is not enough. Governments must legislate to enforce the use of alternatives, starting yesterday. A dead albatross is hanging around our necks, it\u2019s full of plastic waste \u2026 but we\u2019re the ones who will choke on the stuff. \u2022 Van Badham is a Guardian Australia columnist",

      "bodyText": "The lord mayor of Sydney, Clover Moore, has warned that \u201cthe entire credibility of the planning system\u201d in New South Wales is at stake after the premier intervened to order a speedy review of planning controls in Pyrmont, where her own planning department has blocked the development of a 62-storey tower on top of Star casino. The rejection of the Star proposal for the 237 metre tower, in the historic area zoned for eight storeys to the west of the CBD, has bitterly divided the state government and led to a ferocious campaign by Star, aided by the Daily Telegraph and radio talkback host Alan Jones. The review by the Greater Sydney Commission will inevitably result in planning controls for the historic suburb \u2013 regarded as a model of urban renewal \u2013 coming under intense pressure from developers. Moore called the review \u201can astounding betrayal of public trust\u201d, given Pyrmont residents had chosen to live there based on the council\u2019s planning process. The mayor, who was due to move a mayoral minute at the city council meeting on Monday night, said the process was of \u201cvital importance to maintaining public faith in the credibility of the planning system\u201d. \u201cAs residents in Pyrmont have expressed to me, their suburb is a successful example of urban renewal, guided by master plans and local environment plans with established parameters for redevelopment. But the Star Casino\u2019s proposal undermines this community\u2019s vision for their area,\u201d she said. \u201cIt appears that the certainty that the City of Sydney\u2019s earlier planning process gave to residents in Pyrmont, which influenced their decisions to live there, is under threat. It is an astounding betrayal of public trust.\u201d The premier, Gladys Berejiklian, said the NSW government now had a strategic vision for Pyrmont and the western harbour precinct as \u201ca vibrant residential, entertainment and innovation hub on the fringe of Sydney\u2019s CBD\u201d. \u201cI am sending a strong message that Pyrmont is open for business and ready to be taken to the next level,\u201d Berejiklian said. \u201cSydney is Australia\u2019s only true global city and we have a unique opportunity before us to transform Pyrmont and the western harbour precinct into an iconic destination. \u201cWith a growing population, we know there will be more development in Pyrmont in the future. With that will come opportunities to build more transport links, including a potential Metro station. \u201cWhile individual applications will continue to be determined on their merits, this review sends a clear signal that our government believes the Pyrmont area has a bright and exciting future as a key part of the NSW visitor economy.\u201d Most of the Victorian terraces and turn-of-the century warehouses have been preserved in the area, once home to dock workers and a power station, but there is some new development along the waterfront on the western edge. Whole streets, including main street Harris Street, and many of the warehouses, have been heritage listed. The Star casino, which was built in 1995 at the power station site, has continually expanded and now includes a 10-storey hotel. In 2017, the Star lodged plans for a 62-storey, 237m high-rise tower on top of the existing casino, following a design competition. A tower of similar size is being built on the city side of Darling Harbour for the Barangaroo casino, owned by Star\u2019s rival, Crown Resorts. The Star Tower plans include 204 luxury residential apartments and a 220-room five-star hotel, a similar proportion to Barangaroo. There were 85 objections from local residents, businesses and the City of Sydney, which has consistently espoused a vision of inner Sydney as a city of villages around the high-rise CBD. The planning department recommended against the Star tower last month, saying it was \u201cinconsistent with its immediate context and would result in unacceptable visual impacts due to its scale, isolation and visual dominance of the existing Pyrmont character\u201d. The department said it failed \u201cto promote good design and amenity of the built environment\u201d. This prompted a furious backlash from Star, backed by the Telegraph and Jones. The fate of the Star tower was due to be settled by an Independent Planning Commission panel, which was to have held public hearings next month. Now the premier appears to have preempted that process and signalled that she wants an entirely different future for Ultimo and Pyrmont \u2013 potentially as an expansion of the CBD. The review, which will be conducted over just 50 days, will include the entire peninsula from Broadway down to the tip of Pyrmont and will take in other sites slated for development, including the Sydney Fish Markets and the Powerhouse Museum, which is being moved to Parramatta.

      "bodyText": "The Tasmanian government has confirmed it will move to abolish the state\u2019s archaic sexual assault gag laws early next year. It comes one week after Grace Tame, 24, the sexual assault survivor who campaigned for law reform, won a supreme court exemption to tell her story of being groomed by a school teacher. At the age of 15, Tame was repeatedly sexually abused by her 58-year-old maths teacher, Nicolaas Bester, who was convicted and served time in jail for molesting her. Under Tasmania\u2019s Evidence Act, survivors of sexual abuse are prohibited from being named and telling their story. In 2012 a Tasmanian newspaper published the name of a rape victim, with her consent, and was fined $20,000. A Tasmanian government spokesman confirmed it is considering legal changes that will ensure the right balance between protecting all victims of sexual assault and the public interest in open justice. \u201cWe must be careful to get this reform right.

Tame was the first female survivor to be named after obtaining a court exemption to speak about her experience. \u201cI\u2019ve been blown away by all the love I\u2019ve felt from so many people. It shows that when we work together as a community, we can change things for victims and their families,\u201d Tame told News Corp. Over the years Bester has been able to speak about the saga but, until last week, Tame was known by the pseudonym Jane Doe. Two years ago, Tame teamed up with Nina Funnell, a freelance journalist and sexual assault survivor, and began the #LetHerSpeak campaign aimed at overturning the gag clauses in Tasmanian and Northern Territory law. Funnell is pleased the Tasmanian government has made the issue a priority and said the campaign focus will shift to the NT once law reform is achieved in Tasmania. She said Tame\u2019s story had prompted many parents to have serious conversations with their children about the warning signs of grooming. \u201cIt\u2019s been overwhelmingly positive,\u201d Funnell said. \u201cAs we know, sexual assault survivors are terrified that they aren\u2019t going to be believed or that they are going be blamed or shamed over the violence they have experienced.

      "bodyText": "Australian federal police are fighting a federal court ruling that a smartphone is not considered a computer, making a warrant it was using to force a suspect to unlock a phone invalid. In August last year, the AFP obtained a warrant under section 3LA of the Crimes Act to unlock a gold-coloured Samsung phone found in the centre console of the man\u2019s car when he was pulled over and searched. The man supplied the password for a laptop also in the car, and a second phone did not have a pin to unlock, but when asked about the gold phone, he answered \u201cno comment\u201d and would not provide a password for the phone. He later claimed it wasn\u2019t his phone and he didn\u2019t know the password to access it. The federal court last month overturned the magistrate\u2019s decision to grant a warrant forcing the man to provide assistance in unlocking the phone. The decision was overturned on several grounds, notably judge Richard White found that the Samsung phone was not a computer or data storage device as defined by the federal Crimes Act. The law does not define a computer, but defines data storage devices as a \u201cthing containing, or designed to contain, data for use by a computer\u201d. White found that the phone could not be defined as a computer or data storage device. \u201cWhile a mobile phone may have the capacity to \u2018perform mathematical computations electronically according to a series of stored instructions called a program\u2019, it does not seem apt to call such an item a computer,\u201d he said. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cMobile phones are primarily devices for communicating although it is now commonplace for them to have a number of other functions ... Again, the very ubiquity of mobile phones suggests that, if the parliament had intended that they should be encompassed by the term \u2018computer\u2019 it would have been obvious to say so.\u201d He also overturned the decision arguing that the order was not specific enough to what the AFP required the man to do \u2013 provide a password or pin or a fingerprint, or to decrypt any data. The AFP commissioner argued that the order was written requiring the man to provide \u201cparticular information or assistance\u201d in order to allow flexibility in what they required him to do without needing to get another warrant. In the appeal filed earlier this month, obtained by Guardian Australia, the AFP argued that level of specificity was not required under the law, and White erred in stating that the phone was not a computer because a smartphone \u201cperforms the same functions and mathematical computations as a computer and is designed to contain data for use by a computer\u201d. No court date has yet been set for the appeal. The Australian federal police declined to comment to Guardian Australia on the broader implications of the decision, stating in was inappropriate to comment while an appeal was under way. In his judgment, White noted that much of 3LA in the Crimes Act had been amended as part of the Telecommunications (Assistance and Access) Act passed in December 2018, and the case in question is about the law before it was amended. The amendments to the Crimes Act, however, did not define a computer or data storage device beyond what was already in the law. The changes to 3LA just increased the penalty for failure to comply with such orders from two years to a maximum of 10 years in jail.",

But it\u2019s Kendall who this week digs deepest for dad\u2019s approval in an episode that sees the hopes of his siblings dented. For the time being, Logan\u2019s leadership of the family is undoubted and undimmed.</p> <p>We begin at a theme park, where disappointed visitors are being turned away. Logan has arranged for the place to be closed so the Roy family can have the run of it for Kendall\u2019s daughter\u2019s birthday (Lord forbid our heroes should have to jostle with commoners). In shades, shambling along like the pariah of the group, Kendall receives a hug from his daughter for arranging for a ride to go faster.

Tom looks on after her with a silent, \u201cHmmm\u201d. At the meeting, Stewy is on TV talking down Waystar Royco. \u201cKendall Roy is no longer relevant,\u201d he says, a remark that cuts Kendall quietly and deeply. Shiv urges that they come back with a \u201csalty refrain\u201d rather than sit on their hands. Logan agrees. Conversation then turns to the new media website Vaulter. Believing he might have been \u201csuckered\u201d by the troubled site, he dispatches Kendall and Roman to look into it. \u201cThe one who fixes it gets a cookie.\u201d</p> <p>At Tom and Shiv\u2019s new place, Tom is feeling somewhat pumped up by his new job at the news channel ATN, full of his own importance and testosterone, a king in whose eyes \u201ceveryone else looks two feet tall.\u201d He proposes a \u201ccheeky breakfast bang\u201d with Shiv. (Did \u201cbanging\u201d not go out with \u201cbonking\u201d?). She has to take a moment behind a screen to get away from him.</p> <p>At Vaulter, Kendall explains to Lawrence that to allay their father\u2019s suspicions they need to check the books.

Tom, who regards qualms the same way he would regard petticoats, urges him to \u201cman up\u201d. A meeting with the head of ATN is initially cordial \u2013 \u201cThe peach, the legend!\u201d enthuses Tom \u2013 but quickly turns frosty as Tom reveals his own disdain for the news network, especially its demographic, whose median age is 68.</p> <p>Maybe he could shake things up? \u201cHe (Logan) sends me one of you every four years,\u201d retorts the head. They part with mutual fuck you\u2019s; Tom immediately orders Greg to \u201cbody shame\u201d the company, find excess, \u201csnuffle for waste\u201d. Eventually, Greg discovers that the company runs entirely on an analogue basis. Digitalisation could save Waystar 50 \u201cskulls\u201d \u2013 Tom\u2019s lovely phrase for fired staff.</p> <p>Despite having to work alongside ex-lover Nate, Shiv is on the up with Senator Gil Eavis. His polls are looking good, especially now that he is well in with Logan. At an event for his team, he offers her a job as Chief of Staff, food for thought a good deal more appetising than the pizza he is serving. Not all is rosy with Shiv, though: at a meeting with her father, it becomes clear that the offer he made her last week will take three years to materialise, with a management training course included. She is affronted; would he ask such a thing of Roman? That\u2019s the way of the world, says Logan \u2013 but as Shiv observes, it\u2019s a world he had a part in making.</p> <h2>\u2018Find another chicken coop\u2019</h2> <p>Roman and Kendall return from their audit of Vaulter to present their findings to Logan. Roman had looked on from his own office with suspicion at Kendall deep in the books, \u201cdoing stuff\u201d, stuff if which he is incapable. Instead, he tries to blag info, first from Gerri, then by taking Vaulter staff out for a drink. Kendall says that having gone through the books he has found a lot of mess, but believes that the company still has the potential to be \u201cour lodestar\u201d. Roman, however, says the firm should be gutted, not least because he\u2019s discovered staff are planning to unionise.</p> <p>Logan goes with Roman; another humiliation, compounded when he asks Roman to join him in the proxy battle against Stewy and co, while Kendall must go carry out Roman\u2019s recommendations. However, his visit to Vaulter is relatively amicable, and despite continuing taunting from Lawrence, its head.Kendall tells Lawrence that he can, with some cooperation from the Vaulter staff, still persuade his dad not to shut the site down. They could \u201ccool it\u201d on the unionising, for a start.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Connor is hosting an event at a large hotel, the base for his presidential bid, which Roman, for one, still can\u2019t take seriously. Is it, he asks, a \u201cnatural progression from never done nothing, never, to president?\u201d</p> <p>Unable to contain herself, Shiv tells Tom about her dad\u2019s offer back at the Hamptons, albeit playing it down and trying to accommodate Tom\u2019s own gargantuan ambition. He is stunned, congratulatory but, like a centrist Labour MP learning in 2017 that Jeremy Corbyn has done rather better than expected at the general election, can\u2019t conceal all his emotions. \u201cThis is \u2026 a modification of the plan \u2026 quite a big modification,\u201d he blusters.</p> <p>There follows an awkward dinner party at Roman and Tabitha\u2019, where Tom is teased for his poor dress sense; he cuts it dead with a \u201cfuck off, Shiv\u201d, that reveals his latent begrudging of her success. Later, she tries to placate him; he advises her, in order to avoid being destroyed like Kendall, to keep options open. Her next move, however, is to abruptly pick a fight with Gil and quit his campaign.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Kendall returns to Vaulter, rocking up in black riding pillion on a motorbike, which gives him the an assassin\u2019s air. In a brief address to the staff, who he had previously given a pep talk to asking them to come up with ideas for the site, he tells them they are all fired with immediate effect. That earlier meeting had merely been to buy time and stop them unionising, as well as harvest their ideas. Despite his belief in the company, Kendall takes great pleasure in telling Lawrence to \u201cfind another chicken coop.\u201d</p> <p>Having partied in celebration at the apartment he has lent to Greg, Kendall reports back to his dad that the deed is done. He is rewarded with a role in the proxy battle in lieu of an aghast Roman, who had held out high hopes of being the successor. Serves the little sod right. As for Kendall, he calls in at a dime store and casually steals some batteries, only to throw them in the bin, simply because he can. His own inner demon is back like a mojo.</p> <h2>The heir apparent?</h2> <p>Abused by Roman as a \u201cbroken robot\u201d and a \u201cpaedo on parole\u201d and seemingly snubbed by his father, Kendall seems to have understood that shutting Vaulter was a test for him; one he has coolly passed. And now, albeit with a zombie-like devotion, he is at the right hand of his dad.</p> <h2>Notes and observations</h2> <ul> <li><p>Kendall says that Vaulter might function better if there were \u201cgrownups in the room\u201d but what\u2019s striking in the behaviour of the Roy siblings is their childishness; theirs is the code of 12-year-olds in the school playground, a world of petty sadism, taunts and masked insecurity, of which this episode is chockful. Tom is both perpetrator and victim, whether mocking Greg for his mooted Staten Island move, or being mocked at the dinner party. Roman is perpetually at it. It\u2019s a psychological consequence of being in the shadow of a patriarch who asserts his continued dominance by refusing to acknowledge the adult-ness of his offspring, wants a monopoly on the grown-upness.</p></li> <li><p>Great new word; Lawrence talks of being \u201cFacefucked\u201d when Facebook changed their algorithm, affecting Vaulter\u2019s traffic.</p></li> <li><p>It\u2019s telling that both Tom and Shiv\u2019s previous dalliances were featured tonight, a reminder of the faulty foundations of their liaison. You suspect that their relationship is going to come under severe strain this season. And then what?</p></li> </ul>",

Is it, he asks, a \u201cnatural progression from never done nothing, never, to president?\u201d Unable to contain herself, Shiv tells Tom about her dad\u2019s offer back at the Hamptons, albeit playing it down and trying to accommodate Tom\u2019s own gargantuan ambition. He is stunned, congratulatory but, like a centrist Labour MP learning in 2017 that Jeremy Corbyn has done rather better than expected at the general election, can\u2019t conceal all his emotions. \u201cThis is \u2026 a modification of the plan \u2026 quite a big modification,\u201d he blusters. There follows an awkward dinner party at Roman and Tabitha\u2019, where Tom is teased for his poor dress sense; he cuts it dead with a \u201cfuck off, Shiv\u201d, that reveals his latent begrudging of her success. Later, she tries to placate him; he advises her, in order to avoid being destroyed like Kendall, to keep options open. Her next move, however, is to abruptly pick a fight with Gil and quit his campaign. Meanwhile, Kendall returns to Vaulter, rocking up in black riding pillion on a motorbike, which gives him the an assassin\u2019s air. In a brief address to the staff, who he had previously given a pep talk to asking them to come up with ideas for the site, he tells them they are all fired with immediate effect. That earlier meeting had merely been to buy time and stop them unionising, as well as harvest their ideas. Despite his belief in the company, Kendall takes great pleasure in telling Lawrence to \u201cfind another chicken coop.\u201d Having partied in celebration at the apartment he has lent to Greg, Kendall reports back to his dad that the deed is done. He is rewarded with a role in the proxy battle in lieu of an aghast Roman, who had held out high hopes of being the successor. Serves the little sod right. As for Kendall, he calls in at a dime store and casually steals some batteries, only to throw them in the bin, simply because he can. His own inner demon is back like a mojo. The heir apparent? Abused by Roman as a \u201cbroken robot\u201d and a \u201cpaedo on parole\u201d and seemingly snubbed by his father, Kendall seems to have understood that shutting Vaulter was a test for him; one he has coolly passed. And now, albeit with a zombie-like devotion, he is at the right hand of his dad. Notes and observations Kendall says that Vaulter might function better if there were \u201cgrownups in the room\u201d but what\u2019s striking in the behaviour of the Roy siblings is their childishness; theirs is the code of 12-year-olds in the school playground, a world of petty sadism, taunts and masked insecurity, of which this episode is chockful. Tom is both perpetrator and victim, whether mocking Greg for his mooted Staten Island move, or being mocked at the dinner party. Roman is perpetually at it. It\u2019s a psychological consequence of being in the shadow of a patriarch who asserts his continued dominance by refusing to acknowledge the adult-ness of his offspring, wants a monopoly on the grown-upness. Great new word; Lawrence talks of being \u201cFacefucked\u201d when Facebook changed their algorithm, affecting Vaulter\u2019s traffic. It\u2019s telling that both Tom and Shiv\u2019s previous dalliances were featured tonight, a reminder of the faulty foundations of their liaison. You suspect that their relationship is going to come under severe strain this season. And then what?",

      "bodyText": "Power stations in Victoria\u2019s Latrobe Valley and New South Wales\u2019s Lake Macquarie region have been named on a list of the world\u2019s biggest hotspots for toxic air pollution. A new report by Greenpeace, published on Monday, used satellite data published by Nasa to analyse the world\u2019s worst sources of sulphur dioxide (SO2) pollution, an irritant gas known to affect human health and one of the main pollutants contributing to deaths from air pollution worldwide. The greatest source of SO2 in the atmosphere is the burning of fossil fuels in power stations and other industrial facilities. Australia ranks 12th on a list of the top-emitting countries for human-caused sulphur dioxide emissions and is singled out in the report for air pollution standards that allow power stations to emit sulphur dioxide at higher rates than in China and the EU. It comes as state and federal environment ministers are reviewing Australia\u2019s air pollution standards for sulphur dioxide, now 11 times higher than what is recommended by the World Health Organisation. India, China and Russia rank first, second and third respectively in the Greenpeace report for emissions of SO2 in 2018. The report also ranks the worst individual sources of toxic emissions, with two locations in Australia appearing in the top 50, and a further two inside the top 100. The biggest source of SO2 pollution in Australia is a complex of mining operations with copper, lead and zinc smelters in Mount Isa in Queensland. This site ranked 32nd in the report, producing 207 kilotonnes of sulphur dioxide emissions in 2018, according to the analysis. The Yallourn, Loy Yang A and Loy Yang B power stations in Victoria\u2019s Latrobe Valley ranked 49th at 151 kilotonnes. The Vales Point and Eraring coal-fired power stations in the Lake Macquarie region of NSW ranked 79th, and the Liddell and Bayswater power stations near Muswellbrook in the Hunter Valley 91st. The Victorian SO2 air pollution hotspot covers a population of more than 470,000 people, and the NSW hotspot covers an area of more than 1.7 million people, but Greenpeace said the the impacts from secondary pollution covered a far greater population. In Sydney alone, more than 100 premature deaths a year are thought to be caused by pollution from coal-fired power stations. Nationally it\u2019s more than 4,000. \u201cAustralian coal-burning power stations are polluting at levels that would be illegal in China and most other parts of the world,\u201d said Jonathan Moylan, a campaigner with Greenpeace Australia Pacific. \u201cAir pollution is the price our communities pay for the federal government\u2019s failure to stand up to big polluters. It\u2019s time for state environment ministers to show leadership by championing health-based sulphur and nitrogen dioxide standards, strong pollution limits for industry and speeding up the switch to clean renewable energy.\u201d Sulphur dioxide can cause health problems including heart and lung disease, and asthma. Ben Ewald, a doctor with Doctors for the Environment Australia, said there were places in Australia that had \u201ca serious SO2 problem\u201d and limits were set well above what was needed to protect human health. He said the same was the case for nitrogen dioxide, another airborne pollutant. \u201cThese pollutants can cause childhood asthma, lung disease, cancer, birth defects and reproductive issues,\u201d he said. \u201cAustralian governments must introduce tougher standards to protect community health.\u201d Environmental Justice Australia has been pushing for tougher air pollution standards across the country. EJA is representing the Nature Conservation Council in a legal challenge to the NSW Environmental Protection Authority\u2019s decision not to vary the pollution licences of the Mount Piper, Vales Point and Eraring power stations. EJA is also calling for Victoria\u2019s Environment Protection Authority to finalise a long-running review of the pollution licences for the Latrobe power stations and set tougher limits. \u201cAlthough power stations obviously have [existing] limits on their licences, those limits are so lax that power stations essentially pollute as much as they want,\u201d said Nicola Rivers, EJA\u2019s director of advocacy and research. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty extraordinary to see the Latrobe Valley in that list of highest-polluting hotspots in the world.\u201d \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning A spokesman for the Victorian EPA said it had considered 477 submissions to its review of the three licences in the Latrobe Valley and was drafting its assessment and amendments to the licences. He said the EPA had also designed an air-monitoring network with the Latrobe Valley community \u201cbecause we value their involvement, knowledge and concerns\u201d. \u201cVictoria\u2019s air quality is considered good by world standards but scientific knowledge on the impacts of air pollution on public and environmental health is continually growing and EPA is keen for this to be reflected in industry standards and requirements,\u201d he said. The spokesman said Victoria\u2019s EPA was also leading the national review under way for nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide under the national environment protection (ambient air quality) measure and it was likely this would lead to stricter national standards. There have been 17,000 public submissions to the review.",
